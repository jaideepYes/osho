WHERE DID YOU GET THAT COURAGE FROM?\nInnocence is courage and clarity both.\nThere is no need to have courage if you are innocent. There is no need, either, for any clarity because nothing can be more clear, crystal clear, than innocence. So the whole question is how to protect one’s own innocence.\nInnocence is not something to be achieved. It is not something to be learned.\nIt is not something like a talent: painting, music, poetry, sculpture. It is not like those things. It is more like breathing, something you are born with.\nInnocence is everybody’s nature. Nobody is born other than innocent.\nHow can one be born other than innocent? Birth means you have entered the world as a tabula rasa, nothing is written on you. You have only future, no past. That is the meaning of innocence. So first try to understand all the meanings of innocence.\nThe first is: no past, only future.\nThe past corrupts because it gives you memories, experiences, expectations. All those combined together make you clever but not clear. They make you cunning but not intelligent. They may help you to succeed in the world but in your innermost being you will be a failure. And all the success of the world means nothing compared to the failure that finally you are going to face, because ultimately only your inner self remains with you. All is lost: your glory, your power, your name, your fame – all start disappearing like shadows.\nAt the end only that remains which you had brought in the very beginning. You can take from this world only that which you have brought in.\nIn India it is common wisdom that the world is like a waiting room in a railway station; it is not your house. You are not going to remain in the waiting room forever. Nothing in the waiting room belongs to you – the furniture, the paintings on the wallYou use them – you see the painting, you sit on\nthe chair, you rest on the bed – but nothing belongs to you. You are just here for a few minutes, or for a few hours at the most, then you will be gone.\nYes, what you have brought in with you, into the waiting room, you will take away with you; that’s yours. What have you brought into the world? And the world certainly is a waiting room. The waiting may not be in seconds, minutes, hours, days, it may be in years; but what does it matter whether you wait seven hours, or seventy years?\nYou may forget, in seventy years, that you are just in a waiting room. You may start thinking perhaps you are the owner, perhaps this is the house you have built. You may start putting your nameplate on the waiting room.\nThere are people – I have seen it, because I was traveling so much: people have written their names in the bathrooms of the waiting room. People have engraved their names on the furniture of the waiting room. It looks stupid, but it is very similar to what people do in the world. There is a very significant story in ancient Jaina scriptures .…\nIn India it is believed that if somebody can become the emperor of the whole world he is called a chakravartin. The word chakravartin simply means ... CHAKRA means the wheel. In ancient India it was a way to avoid unnecessary fighting and violence: a chariot, a golden chariot, very valuable, with beautiful and strong horses, would move from one kingdom to another kingdom. If the other kingdom did not resist and let the chariot pass, that meant that kingdom had accepted the owner of the chariot as its superior. Then there was no need to fight.\nThis way the chariot would move, and wherever people obstructed the chariot, then there would be war. If the chariot was not obstructed anywhere, then without any war, the superiority of the king was proved: he become a chakravartin – one whose wheel has moved around and whom nobody has been able to obstruct. This has been the desire of all the kings, to become a chakravartin.\nCertainly it needs more power than Alexander the Great had. Just to send your chariot ... it needs tremendous power to support it. It needs the absolute certainty that if the chariot is obstructed there is going to be a mass slaughter. It means the man is recognized already, that if he wants to conquer anybody there is no way to prevent him conquering you.\nBut it is a very symbolic way, more civilized thanThere is no need to attack, there is no need to\nstart killing; just send a symbolic message. So with the flag of the king, the chariot will go, and if the other king feels that there is no point in resisting – fighting simply means defeat and unnecessary violence, destruction – he welcomes the chariot, and in his capital, flowers are thrown over the chariot.\nThis seems to be a far more civilized way than what the Soviet Union and America are going to do. Just send a beautiful chariot – but that means your strength should be something absolutely certain to you; and not only to you, it should be certain to everybody else. Only then can such a symbol be of any help. So every king had the desire to become a chakravartin someday.\nThe story is that one man became a chakravartin – and it happens only once in thousands of years that a man becomes a chakravartin. Even Alexander the Great was not a world conqueror; there was yet much left unconquered. And he died very young, he was only thirty-three: there was not even time enough to conquer the world. What to say of conquering, the whole world was not even known. Half of the world was unknown, and the half that was known, even that was not conquered. This man, of whom I am going to tell you the story, became the chakravartin.\nIt is said that when a chakravartin dies – because a chakravartin happens only in thousands of years, he is a rare being – when he dies he is received in heaven with great rejoicings and he is taken to a special place.\nIn Jaina mythology, in heaven there is a parallel mountain to the Himalayas. The Himalayas are just made of rocks and earth and ice. The parallel Himalayas in heaven is called Sumeru. Sumeru means the ultimate mountain: nothing can be higher than that, nothing can be better than that. It is solid gold; instead of rocks there are diamonds and rubies and emeralds.\nWhen a chakravartin dies he is led to Sumeru mountain to engrave his name on it. That is a rare opportunity; that happens only once in thousands of years. Of course this man was immensely excited that he was going to write his name on Sumeru. That is the ultimate catalogue of all the great ones that have been, and will also be the catalogue of all the great ones who are going to be. This emperor was becoming party to a lineage of supermen.\nThe gatekeeper gave him the instruments to engrave his name. He wanted a few of his men who had committed suicide just because their emperor was dying – they could not think of living without him. His wife, his prime minister, his commander-in-chief – all the great people who were around him, they all had committed suicide, so they had come with him.\nThe emperor wanted the gatekeeper to let them all come to see him engrave his name, because what is the joy if you go alone and engrave your name and nobody is there even to see? – because the real joy is that the whole world should see.\nThe gatekeeper said, “You listen to my advice, because this is my inherited profession. My father was a gatekeeper, his father was a gatekeeper; for centuries we have been gatekeepers to Sumeru mountain. Listen to my advice: Don’t take them with you; otherwise you will repent.”\nThe emperor could not understand, but he could not even go against his advice – because what interest could that man have in preventing him?\nThe gatekeeper said, “If you still want them to see, first go engrave your name; then come back and take them with you if you want. I have no objection even now if you want to take them, but just in case you decide not to, then there will be no place, no chance ... they will be with you. You go alone.” This was perfectly sane advice.\nThe emperor said, “That’s good. I will go alone, engrave my name, come back, and call you all.” The gatekeeper said, “I am perfectly agreeable to that.”\nThe emperor went and he saw the Sumeru shining under thousands of suns – because in heaven you cannot be so poor as to have just one sun – thousands of suns, and a golden mountain far bigger than the Himalayas – and the Himalayas are almost two thousands miles long! He could not open his eyes for a moment, it was so glaring there. And then he started looking for a space, the right space, but he was very much puzzled: there was no space; the whole mountain was engraved with names.\nHe could not believe his eyes. For the first time he became aware what he was. Up to now he was thinking he was a superman who happens once in thousands of years. But time has been from eternity; even thousands of years didn’t make any difference, so many chakravartins had happened already. There was no space on that biggest mountain in the whole universe where he could write his small name.\nHe came back, and now he understood that the gatekeeper was right not to take his wife and his commander-in-chief and his prime minister and other intimate friends. It was good that they had not seen the situation. They would still believe that their emperor was a rare being.\nHe took the gatekeeper inside and he said, “But there is no space!”\nThe gatekeeper said, “That’s what I was telling you. What you have to do is to erase a few names and write down your name. That’s what has been done; my whole life I have been seeing this done, my father used to say this has been done. My father’s father – none of my family have seen Sumeru empty, or any space ever.\n“Whenever a chakravartin has come he had to erase a few names and write his own name. So this is not the whole history of the chakravartins. Many times it has been erased, many times it has been engraved. You just do your work, and then if you want to show your friends you can bring them in.”\nThe emperor said, “No, I don’t want to show them and I don’t want to even write my name. What is the point? – someday somebody will come and erase it.\n“My whole life has become utterly meaningless. This was my only hope, that Sumeru, the golden mountain in heaven was going to have my name. For this I have lived, for this I have staked my life; for this I was ready to kill the whole world. And anybody else can erase my name and write his. What is the point of writing it? I will not write it.” The gatekeeper laughed.\nThe emperor said, “Why are you laughing?”\nThe gatekeeper said, “This is strange, because this too I have been hearing from my grandfathers – that chakravartins come, and seeing the whole story, just turn back; they don’t write their names. You are not new: anybody having a little intelligence would do the same.”\nIn this whole world what can you gain? What can you take away with you?\nYour name, your prestige, your respectability? Your money, your power – what? Your scholarship? You cannot take anything.\nEverything will have to be dropped here.\nAnd in that moment you will understand that all that you possessed was not yours; the very idea of possession was wrong. And because of that possession you were corrupted.\nTo increase that possession – to have more money, to have more power, to conquer more lands – you were doing things which even you cannot say were right. You were lying, you were dishonest. You were having hundreds of faces. You were not true even for a single moment to anybody or to yourself; you could not be.\nYou had to be false, phony, pretending, because these are things that help you to succeed in the world. Authenticity is not going to help you. Honesty is not going to help you. Truthfulness is not going to help you.\nWithout possessions, success, fame; who are you? You don’t know.\nYou are your name, you are your fame, you are your prestige, your power. But other than these, who are you?\nSo this whole possessiveness becomes your identity. It gives you a false sense of being. That’s the ego.\nEgo is not something mysterious, it is a very simple phenomenon. You don’t know who you are, and to live without knowing who you are is impossible. If I don’t know who I am, then what am I doing here? Then whatsoever I am doing becomes meaningless. The first and the foremost thing\nis to know who I am. Perhaps then I can do something that fulfills my nature, makes me contented, brings me home.\nBut if I don’t know who I am, and I go on doing things, how can I manage to reach where my nature was supposed to reach, to lead? I have been running hither and thither but there is not going to be any point that I can say, “Now I have arrived, this was the place I was searching for.”\nYou don’t know who you are, so some false identity is needed as a substitute. Your possessions give you that false identity.\nWhen Alexander the Great was coming back from India he remembered that his master, Aristotle, had asked him to bring a sannyasin from India. Aristotle had heard about sannyasins. Rumors from business people, travelers, adventurers, were reaching him that a strange kind of man exists in India: the sannyasin. It was absolutely unbelievable because a sannyasin is possible only when a certain civilization reaches its very peak, not before that. A primitive society cannot have sannyasins.\nOnly a very superior culture, rich, can become fed up with richness, fed up with culture, fed up with civilization. You cannot be fed up with something which you don’t have. To be fed up with something, you need to have it so much that it loses all meaning.\nThere is a continuous loss in meaning. For example: if you have one million dollars, do you think when you have ten million dollars the dollar will have the same value for you? It will be ten times less. But if you have one hundred thousand million dollars, then in the same proportion the dollar will go on losing its value for you. You can think of a situation where the dollar loses all meaning, it becomes just dust unto dust. But that is possible only when you have so much.\nA country poor, hungry, starving cannot have real sannyasins. Yes, India still has sannyasins but that is just the dead corpse of sannyas carried on by tradition. Otherwise sannyasins disappeared at least two thousand years ago in India – they don’t exist.\nMy effort was the first after two thousand years to bring the sannyasin back in his true color. That became a conflict because the old sannyasin is dead, but he holds the power of tradition, of the past; my sannyasin is alive, but he has no power of the past, no power of tradition, no authority from the scriptures. There was going to be conflict. And the old were afraid: although they knew they had all the authority, one thing was certain – that they were not alive. They may have all the authority but they are a corpse.\nMy sannyasin may not have any authority, but he is alive, and life is the only authority there is; hence, the fear in all different traditions of sannyas in India against my sannyasins.\nWe were not doing any harm to anybody; we were not even concerned. We were simply trying to live our way, not interfering with anybody, not even trespassing on anybody’s path. But strangely, the whole of traditional India – and the whole country is traditional – wanted to destroy my people.\nThe reason is clear: they became aware that if we succeed in surviving then their death has come. Then they cannot remain any more, they will have to disappear. In fact they are living posthumously; they should have disappeared two thousand years before. Exactly at the time when Alexander left India, they should have disappeared.\nAlexander enquired in every place he visited, “I want to see a sannyasin. My master has requested meI asked him, ‘Would you like anything from India?’” – because in those days India was the\ngolden bird. Everything valuable was coming from India – in fact Europe was almost in a barbarous state. But Aristotle had asked not for something that Alexander could have thought of, imagined. He asked a very strange thing: “Bring a sannyasin.”\nAlexander enquired in every place he visited, and everybody said, “You come a little late.” It was five hundred years after Buddha that Alexander reached India. They said, “You should have come five hundred years before, or at least two hundred years before.\n“If you had come five hundred years before you would have been greeted by sannyasins everywhere; they were all over the place. They were a strange tribe of people. Even if you had come two hundred years before you would have found one here, one there. That great era of the sannyasins had passed but a few remnants were still available. Now it is very difficult, but you go on trying; perhaps somewhere you may be able to find one.”\nAlexander was very puzzled: he would not even be able to present to his master the simple gift he had asked for; but finally at the border he found a man. People said, “You have come to the right place. This is the man.” Alexander reports in his memoirs that the man’s name was Dandamis; that seems to be a Greek transliteration of some Indian word.\nI have been thinking what exactly it could be, because Dandamis is not an Indian word. But there has been a certain group of sannyasins who are called Danda Swami. Danda means a staff – they carry a staff – and swami means a master of oneself. So it seems “Danda swami” somehow has got mixed and become “Dandamis.”\nAlexander sent his people – obviously. Alexander was a great conqueror, emperor: he would not go to the sannyasin. The sannyasin was just a beggar, and Alexander heard from people that he was naked and just lived by the side of the river under a tree.\nAlexander sent four soldiers with naked swords and told them, “Invite the swami. Tell him, ‘Alexander the Great wants you to be his guest. He wants to take you to his country with great respect and honor, and you will remain there as a royal guest. This is something very special, because Alexander has never invited anybody the way he is inviting you.’”\nThey went, and they told Dandamis. The naked man simply laughed. He said, “A man who calls himself Alexander the Great cannot be really great. That is a sign of a very mean mind, to think of oneself as ‘the Great’.”\nThe soldiers were shocked. They said, “What are you saying? Can’t you see our naked swords?”\nDandamis said, “I am not blind like you, and like your Alexander the Great. If you who are blind can see, can’t I, who am not blind, see? Just go and tell Alexander that a sannyasin moves according to his will. Thanks for your invitation, and in return I invite you to be here with me, my guest under my tree, to have some taste of what sannyas is.”\nAlexander was very angry when he heard that this had been the response. He himself went and he said, “I am a dangerous man.”\nAgain the naked man laughed, and he said, “You cannot be more dangerous than I am. If you are so dangerous, why are you carrying this sword and having so many people around you with naked swords? Look at me, standing naked – and you think you are dangerous? Have you come to accept my invitation and be with me, or have you come to repeat your invitation?”\nAlexander said, “I have come to take you forcibly. Now it is no longer an invitation: either you come with us, or this sword will cut your head off and finish you right now.”\nDandamis laughed a third time, and he said, “That’s great! You do it, right now. I am not moving from here. Nobody can move me against my will. Yes, you can cut off my head because that does not belong to me, but you cannot shake me; that is my citadel where I am absolutely the emperor.\n“You can cut off my head, you can cut off my hands, you can cut off my legs, you can cut my whole body into pieces, but remember one thing: when you are cutting my body, my head, my hands, I will be watching in the same way as you will be watching. Your sword cannot cut me, my watcher cannot be penetrated by a sword. So start!” he said.\nBut it is so difficult to kill such a man, who is inviting you to kill him. Alexander said, “I am sorry that I disturbed you, but now I know why my master asked me to bring a sannyasin. And now I also know why I could not find a sannyasin in so many places I have been visiting. Now I understand also why people were saying, ‘You have come five hundred years late. The whole country was full of sannyasins; now they are certainly a rare phenomenon.’\n“I don’t know what this watcher is, but seeing you, looking at you – your integrity, your strength – makes me feel that I have wasted my life. Perhaps rather than conquering the whole world, if I had also found this watcher that would have been better.”\nYou come with an innocent watcher into the world. Everybody comes in the same way, with the same quality of consciousness.\nThe question is, how did I manage so that nobody could corrupt my innocence, clarity; from where did I get this courage? How could I manage not to be humiliated by grown-ups and their world?\nI have not done anything, so there is no question of how. It simply happened, so I cannot take the credit for it.\nPerhaps it happens to everybody but you become interested in other things. You start bargaining with the grown-up world. They have many things to give to you; you have only one thing to give, and that is your integrity, your self-respect. You don’t have much, a single thing – you can call it anything: innocence, intelligence, authenticity. You have only one thing.\nAnd the child is naturally very much interested in everything he sees around. He is continuously wanting to have this, to have that; that is part of human nature. If you look at the small child, even a just-born baby, you can see he has started groping for something; his hands are trying to find out something. He has started the journey.\nIn the journey he will lose himself, because you can’t get anything in this world without paying for it. And the poor child cannot understand that what he is giving is so valuable that if the whole world\nis on one side, and his integrity on the other side, then too his integrity will be more weighty, more valuable. The child has no way to know about it. This is the problem, because what he has got he has simply got. He takes it for granted.\nLet me tell you one story which will make it clear. One rich man, very rich, became in the end very frustrated – which is a natural outcome of all success. Nothing fails like success. Success is significant only if you are a failure. Once you succeed then you know that you have been cheated by the world, by the people, by the society. The man had all the riches but no peace of mind. He started looking for peace of mind.\nThat’s what is happening in America. In America more people are looking for peace of mind than anywhere else. In India I have never come across a person who is looking for peace of mind. Peace of the stomach has to be taken care of first – peace of mind is too far away. From the stomach the mind is almost millions of miles away.\nBut in America everybody is looking for peace of mind, and of course when you are looking for it, then people will be there ready to give it to you. This is a simple law of economics: wherever there is demand there is supply. It does not matter whether what you are asking for you really need. Nor does anybody bother about what the supply is going to give you – whether it is just bogus advertisement, propaganda, or whether there is something substantial.\nKnowing this simple principle, that wherever there is demand there is supply, the cunning and clever people have gone one step ahead. Now they say, “There is no need to wait for demand to happen, you create the demand.” And that is the whole art of advertisement: it is creating demand.\nBefore you read the advertisement you had no such demand, you had never felt that this was your need. But reading the advertisement, suddenly you feel, “My God, I have been missing it. And I am such a fool that I never knew that this thing exists.”\nBefore somebody starts manufacturing something, producing something, even years ahead – three, four years ahead – he starts advertising. The thing is not there yet in the market because first the demand has to reach the minds of people. And once the demand is there, by that time the supply will be ready.\nBernard Shaw has said that when he was new and he published his first book, of course there was no demand – nobody had ever heard about George Bernard Shaw. How can you demand, “I want George Bernard Shaw’s book, his drama?” So what he used to do the whole dayHe published\nthe book – he himself was the publisher, he put together the money himself – and then he went from one bookstore to another bookstore asking, “Have you got George Bernard Shaw’s book?”\nThey said, “George Bernard Shaw? We never heard the name.”\nHe said, “Strange, such a great man and you have never heard of him and you run a bookstore? Are you out-of-date or something? The first thing you should do is get George Bernard Shaw’s book.” He had published only one book but he started advertising for several books, because when you are going around, why just publicize one book? And one book does not make a man a great writer.\nHe would go in different clothes – sometimes with a hat, sometimes with glasses. And people started calling at George Bernard Shaw’s house. And he had to do all this – the advertising, supplying; that’s how he sold his first book. He was asking people on the street, “Have you heard ... because I am hearing so much about a certain book written by some George Bernard Shaw. People say it is just great, fantastic. Have you heard?”\nThey would say, “No, we have never even heard the name.”\nHe said, “This is strange. I used to think London was a cultured society.” And he went to libraries and clubs and every place where there was a possibility to create a demand, and he created the demand. He sold the book, and finally – that’s what he was continuously doing – finally he became one of the greatest writers of this age. He had created the demand.\nBut if you succeed, there is no need for anybody to create the demand for peace of mind. If you succeed, you lose peace of mind on the way. That is a natural course. Success takes all peace from your mind. It simply sucks everything that is significant in life: peace, silence, joy, love. It goes on taking everything away from you. Finally your hands are full of junk, and all that was valuable is lost. And suddenly you realize peace of mind is needed.\nImmediately there are suppliers, who don’t know anything about mind, who don’t know anything about peace. I have read one book entitled PEACE OF MIND by a Jewish rabbi, Joshua Liebman. I have gone through the whole book; the man knows neither about peace nor does he know about the mind. But he is a businessman, he is a Jew: He has done a good job without knowing anything about peace of mind.\nHis book is one of the best sellers in the world because whoever wants peace of mind is bound to sooner or later find Joshua Liebman’s book. And he has written it beautifully. He is a good writer, very articulate, impressive; you will be influenced by it. But peace of mind will remain as far away as it was before, or it may even have gone farther away by your reading this book.\nIn fact, if man knows what peace is, and what mind is, he cannot write a book entitled PEACE OF MIND, because mind is the cause of all unpeace, all restlessness. Peace is when there is no mind. So peace of mind – no commodity like this exists. If mind is there, then peace is not. If peace is there then mind is not. But to write a book “Peace of No Mind” ... nobody is going to purchase it. I have been thinking ... but I thought, nobody is going to purchase “Peace of No Mind”. It just will not make sense to them, but that’s exactly the truth.\nThe child is unaware of what he has brought with him. This rich man was in the same position. He had all the riches in the world, and now he was searching for peace of mind. He went from one sage to another and they all gave great advice, but advice helps nobody.\nIn fact only fools give advice, and only fools take advice. Wise people are very reluctant to give you advice because a wise man certainly knows that the only thing in the world which is given freely is advice, and that which is never taken by anybody is advice, so why should he bother?\nA wise man first prepares you so that you can take the advice. He does not simply give you advice; you need to be prepared. It may take years to prepare you, to prepare the ground, and only then\ncan you sow the seeds. It will be a fool who simply goes on throwing seeds on rocks and stones without even bothering that he is wasting seeds.\nAll these sages gave him advice but nothing clicked. Finally a man whom he had not asked, who was not in any way a famous man – on the contrary he was thought to be the village idiot – that man stopped him on the road one day and said, “You are unnecessarily wasting your time: none of these are sages. I know them perfectly, but because I am an idiot nobody believes me. Perhaps you will also not believe me, but I know a sage.”\n“Just seeing you so tortured continuously for peace of mind, I thought it would be better if I showed you the right person. Otherwise I am an idiot; nobody asks me for advice and I never give any advice to anybody. But it was too much: seeing you so sad and so miserable, I broke my silence. You go to this man in the next village.”\nThe rich man immediately went, with a big bag full of precious diamonds, on his beautiful horse. He reached there, he saw that man – this man was known to the Sufis as Mulla Nasruddin.\nHe asked the Mulla, “Can you help me to attain peace of mind?” Mulla said, “Help? I can give it to you.”\nThe rich man thought, “This is strange. First that idiot suggested ... and just out of desperation I thought there is no harm, so I came here. This seems to be even a greater idiot: he is saying, ‘I can give it to you.’”\nThe rich man said, “You can give it to me? I have been to all kinds of sages; they all give advice – do this, do that, discipline yourself, do charity, help the poor, open hospitals, this and that. They say all these things, and in fact I have done all those things; nothing helps. In fact more and more trouble arises. And you say you can give it to me?”\nThe Mulla said, “It is so simple. You get down from the horse.” So the rich man got down from the horse. He was holding his bag, and Mulla asked, “What are you holding in your bag so closely to your heart?”\nHe said, “These are precious diamonds. If you can give me peace, I will give you this bag.” But before he could even figure out what was happening, Mulla took the bag and ran away!\nThe rich man, for a moment, was in shock; he could not even understand what to do. And then he had to follow him. But it was Mulla’s own town – he knew every street and shortcut, and he was running. The rich man had never run in his whole life and he was so fat .… He was crying and huffing and puffing, and tears were rolling down. He said, “I have been completely cheated! This man has taken away all my life’s hard work, my earnings; everything he has taken away.”\nSo a crowd followed, and all were laughing. He said, “Are you all idiots? Is this town full of idiots? I have been completely ruined, and rather than catching hold of the thief you are all laughing.”\nThey said, “He is not a thief, he is a very sage man.”\nThe rich man said, “That idiot from my village got me into this trouble!” But somehow, running, perspiring, he followed Mulla. Mulla arrived back under the same tree where the horse was still standing. He sat down under the tree with the bag, and the rich man came crying and weeping. Mulla said, “You take this bag.” The rich man took the bag and put it close to his heart. Mulla said, “How does it feel? Can you feel some peace of mind?”\nThe rich man said, “Yes it feels very peaceful. You are a strange man, and you have strange methods.”\nMulla said, “No strange methods – simple mathematics. Whatever you have, you start taking it for granted. You just have to be given an opportunity to lose it; then immediately you will become aware of what you have lost. You have not gained anything new; it is the same bag that you have been carrying with no peace of mind. Now the same bag you are holding close to your heart and anybody can see how peaceful you are looking, a perfect sage! Just go home, and don’t bother people.”\nThis is the problem for the child, because he comes with innocence and he is ready to buy anything, and give his innocence. He is ready to buy any rubbish and give his courage. He is ready to buy just toys – and what else is there in this world except toys? – and lose his clarity. He will understand only when all these toys are there in his possession and he can’t feel any joy from them, can’t see any achievement, any fulfillment. Then he becomes aware of what he has lost – and he himself has lost it.\nYou are asking me how I managed not to lose my innocence and clarity. I have not done anything; just simply, from the very beginningI was a lonely child because I was brought up by my maternal\ngrandfather and grandmother; I was not with my father and mother. Those two old people were alone and they wanted a child who would be the joy of their last days. So my father and mother agreed: I was their eldest child, the first-born; they sent me.\nI don’t remember any relationship with my father’s family in the early years of my childhood. With these two old men – my grandfather and his old servant, who was really a beautiful man – and my old grandmother ... these three people. And the gap was so bigI was absolutely alone. It was not\na company, it could not be a company. They tried their hardest to be as friendly to me as possible but it was just not possible.\nI was left to myself. I could not say things to them. I had nobody else, because in that small village my family were the richest; and it was such a small village – not more than two hundred people in all – and so poor that my grandparents would not allow me to mix with the village children. They were dirty, and of course they were almost beggars. So there was no way to have friends. That caused a great impact. In my whole life I have never been a friend, I have never known anybody to be a friend. Yes, acquaintances I had.\nIn those first, early years I was so lonely that I started enjoying it; and it is really a joy. So it was not a curse to me, it proved a blessing. I started enjoying it, and I started feeling self-sufficient; I was not dependent on anybody.\nI have never been interested in games for the simple reason that from my very childhood there was no way to play, there was nobody to play with. I can still see myself in those earliest years, just sitting.\nWe had a beautiful spot where our house was, just in front of a lake. Far away for miles, the lake ... and it was so beautiful and so silent. Only once in while would you see a line of white cranes flying, or making love calls, and the peace would be disturbed; otherwise, it was almost the right place for meditation. And when they would disturb the peace – a love call from a bird ... after his call the peace would deepen, it would become deeper.\nThe lake was full of lotus flowers, and I would sit for hours so self-content, as if the world did not matter: the lotuses, the white cranes, the silence .…\nAnd my grandparents were very aware of one thing, that I enjoyed my aloneness. They had continuously been seeing that I had no desire to go to the village to meet anybody, or to talk with anybody. Even if they wanted to talk my answers were yes, or no; I was not interested in talking either. So they became aware of one thing, that I enjoyed my aloneness, and it was their sacred duty not to disturb me.\nSo for seven years continuously nobody tried to corrupt my innocence; there was nobody. Those three old people who lived in the house, the servant and my grandparents, were all protective in every possible way that nobody should disturb me. In fact I started feeling, as I grew up, a little embarrassed that because of me they could not talk, they could not be normal as everybody is. It was just the opposite situation .…\nIt happens with children that you tell them, “Be silent because your father is thinking, your grandfather is resting. Be quiet, sit silently.” In my childhood it happened the opposite way. Now I cannot answer why and how; it simply happened. That’s why I said it simply happened – the credit does not go to me.\nAll those three old people were continuously making signs to each other: “Don’t disturb him – he is enjoying so much.” And they started loving my silence.\nSilence has its vibe; it is infectious, particularly a child’s silence which is not forced, which is not because you are saying, “I will beat you if you create any nuisance or noise.” No, that is not silence. That will not create the joyous vibration that I am talking about, when a child is silent on his own, enjoying for no reason; his happiness is uncaused. That creates great ripples all around.\nIn a better world, every family will learn from children. You are in such a hurry to teach them. Nobody seems to learn from them, and they have much to teach you. And you have nothing to teach them.\nJust because you are older and powerful you start making them just like you without ever thinking about what you are, where you have reached, what your status is in the inner world. You are a pauper; and you want the same for your child also?\nBut nobody thinks; otherwise people would learn from small children. Children bring so much from the other world because they are such fresh arrivals. They still carry the silence of the womb, the silence of the very existence.\nSo it was just a coincidence that for seven years I remained undisturbed – no Miss Judith Martin to nag me, to prepare me for the world of business, politics, diplomacy. My grandparents were more\ninterested in leaving me as natural as possible – particularly my grandmother. She is one of the causes – these small things affect all your life patterns – she is one of the causes of my respect for the whole of womanhood.\nShe was a simple woman, uneducated, but immensely sensitive. She made it clear to my grandfather and the servant: “We all have lived a certain kind of life which has not led us anywhere. We are as empty as ever, and now death is coming close.” She insisted, “Let this child be uninfluenced by us. What influence can we ...? We can only make him like us, and we are nothing. Give him an opportunity to be himself.”\nMy grandfather – I heard them discussing in the night, thinking that I was asleep – used to say to her, “You are telling me to do this, and I am doing it; but he is somebody else’s son, and sooner or later he will have to go to his parents. What will they say? – ‘You have not taught him any manners, any etiquette, he is absolutely wild.’”\nShe said, “Don’t be worried about that. In this whole world everybody is civilized, has manners, etiquette, but what is the gain? You are very civilized – what have you got out of it? At the most his parents will be angry at us. So what? – let them be angry. They can’t harm us, and by that time the child will be strong enough that they cannot change his life course.”\nI am tremendously grateful to that old woman. My grandfather was again and again worried that sooner or later he was going to be responsible: “They will say, ‘We left our child with you and you have not taught him anything.’”\nMy grandmother did not even allow ... because there was one man in the village who could at least teach me the beginnings of language, mathematics, a little geography. He was educated to the fourth grade – the lowest four; that is what was called primary education in India. But he was the most educated man in the town.\nMy grandfather tried hard: “He can come and he can teach him. At least he will know the alphabet, some mathematics, so when he goes to his parents they will not say that we just wasted seven years completely.”\nBut my grandmother said, “Let them do whatsoever they want to do after seven years. For seven years he has to be just his natural self, and we are not going to interfere.” And her argument was always, “You know the alphabet, so what? You know mathematics, so what? You have earned a little money; do you want him also to earn a little money and live just like you?”\nThat was enough to keep that old man silent. What to do? He was in a difficulty because he could not argue, and he knew that he would be held responsible, not she, because my father would ask him, “What have you done?” And actually that would have been the case, but fortunately he died before my father could ask.\nBut my father continuously was saying, “That old man is responsible, he has spoiled the child.” But now I was strong enough, and I made it clear to him: “Before me, never say a single word against my maternal grandfather. He has saved me from being spoiled by you – that is your real anger. But you have other children – spoil them. And at the final stage you will say who is spoiled.”\nHe had other children, and more and more children went on coming. I used to tease him, “You please bring one child more, make it a dozen. Eleven children? People ask,”How many children?” Eleven does not look right; one dozen is more impressive.”\nAnd in later years I used to tell him, “You go on spoiling all your children; I am wild, and I will remain wild.”\nWhat you see as innocence is nothing but wildness. What you see as clarity is nothing but wildness. Somehow I remained out of the grip of civilization.\nAnd once I was strong enoughAnd that’s why these people – Miss Judith Martin, and their kind\n– insist, “Take hold of the child as quickly as possible, don’t waste time because the earlier you take hold of the child, the easier it is. Once the child becomes strong enough, then to bend him according to your desires will be difficult.”\nAnd life has seven-year circles. By the seventh year the child is perfectly strong; now you cannot do anything. Now he knows where to go, what to do. He is capable of arguing. He is capable of seeing what is right and what is wrong. And his clarity will be at the climax when he is seven. If you don’t disturb his earlier years, then at the seventh he is so crystal clear about everything that his whole life will be lived without any repentance.\nI have lived without any repentance. I have tried to find: Have I done anything wrong, ever? Not that people have been thinking that all that I have done is right, that is not the point: 97I have never thought anything that I have done was wrong. The whole world may think it was wrong, but to me there is absolute certainty that it was right; it was the right thing to do.\nSo there is no question of repenting about the past. And when you don’t have to repent about the past you are free from it. The past keeps you entangled like an octopus because you go on feeling, “That thing I should not have done,” or, “That thing which I was supposed to do and did not do”\nAll those things go on pulling you backwards. I don’t see anything behind me, no past.\nIf I say something about my past, it is simply factual memory, it has no psychological involvement. I am telling you as if I am telling you about somebody else. It is just factual; it has nothing to do with my personal involvement. It might have occurred to somebody else, it might have happened to somebody else.\nSo remember, a factual memory is not enslaving. Psychological memory is, and psychological memory is made up of things that you think, or you have been conditioned to think, were wrong and you did them. Then there is a wound, a psychological wound.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"8245","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/from_darkness_to_light/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/from_darkness_to_light/>From Darkness to Light</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">2 Innocence: the price you pay for the failure of success</h1><div class=post-meta>39 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8245 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/From_Darkness_to_Light/part2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

LET YOURSELF BECOME INTIMIDATED BY THE GROWN-UPS AROUND YOU? WHERE DID
YOU GET THAT COURAGE FROM?</p><p><br></p><p>Innocence is courage and clarity both.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need to have courage if you are innocent. There is no
need, either, for any clarity because nothing can be more clear, crystal
clear, than innocence. So the whole question is how to protect one’s own
innocence.</p><p><br></p><p>Innocence is not something to be achieved. It is not something to be
learned.</p><p>It is not something like a talent: painting, music, poetry,
sculpture. It is not like those things. It is more like breathing,
something you are born with.</p><p><br></p><p>Innocence is everybody’s nature. Nobody is born other than
innocent.</p><p>How can one be born other than innocent? Birth means you have entered
the world as a tabula rasa, nothing is written on you. You have only
future, no past. That is the meaning of innocence. So first try to
understand all the meanings of innocence.</p><p><br></p><p>The first is: no past, only future.</p><p><br></p><p>The past corrupts because it gives you memories, experiences,
expectations. All those combined together make you clever but not clear.
They make you cunning but not intelligent. They may help you to succeed
in the world but in your innermost being you will be a failure. And all
the success of the world means nothing compared to the failure that
finally you are going to face, because ultimately only your inner self
remains with you. All is lost: your glory, your power, your name, your
fame – all start disappearing like shadows.</p><p><br></p><p>At the end only that remains which you had brought in the very
beginning. You can take from this world only that which you have brought
in.</p><p><br></p><p>In India it is common wisdom that the world is like a waiting room in
a railway station; it is not your house. You are not going to remain in
the waiting room forever. Nothing in the waiting room belongs to you –
the furniture, the paintings on the wall<span class=s4></span>You use
them – you see the painting, you sit on</p><p>the chair, you rest on the bed – but nothing belongs to you. You are
just here for a few minutes, or for a few hours at the most, then you
will be gone.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, what you have brought in with you, into the waiting room, you
will take away with you; that’s yours. What have you brought into the
world? And the world certainly is a waiting room. The waiting may not be
in seconds, minutes, hours, days, it may be in years; but what does it
matter whether you wait seven hours, or seventy years?</p><p><br></p><p>You may forget, in seventy years, that you are just in a waiting
room. You may start thinking perhaps you are the owner, perhaps this is
the house you have built. You may start putting your nameplate on the
waiting room.</p><p><br></p><p>There are people – I have seen it, because I was traveling so much:
people have written their names in the bathrooms of the waiting room.
People have engraved their names on the furniture of the waiting room.
It looks stupid, but it is very similar to what people do in the world.
There is a very significant story in ancient Jaina scriptures .…</p><p><br></p><p>In India it is believed that if somebody can become the emperor of
the whole world he is called a chakravartin. The word chakravartin
simply means ... CHAKRA means the wheel. In ancient India it was a way
to avoid unnecessary fighting and violence: a chariot, a golden chariot,
very valuable, with beautiful and strong horses, would move from one
kingdom to another kingdom. If the other kingdom did not resist and let
the chariot pass, that meant that kingdom had accepted the owner of the
chariot as its superior. Then there was no need to fight.</p><p><br></p><p>This way the chariot would move, and wherever people obstructed the
chariot, then there would be war. If the chariot was not obstructed
anywhere, then without any war, the superiority of the king was proved:
he become a chakravartin – one whose wheel has moved around and whom
nobody has been able to obstruct. This has been the desire of all the
kings, to become a chakravartin.</p><p>Certainly it needs more power than Alexander the Great had. Just to
send your chariot ... it needs tremendous power to support it. It needs
the absolute certainty that if the chariot is obstructed there is going
to be a mass slaughter. It means the man is recognized already, that if
he wants to conquer anybody there is no way to prevent him conquering
you.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is a very symbolic way, more civilized than<span class=s4></span>There is no need to attack, there is no need to</p><p>start killing; just send a symbolic message. So with the flag of the
king, the chariot will go, and if the other king feels that there is no
point in resisting – fighting simply means defeat and unnecessary
violence, destruction – he welcomes the chariot, and in his capital,
flowers are thrown over the chariot.</p><p><br></p><p>This seems to be a far more civilized way than what the Soviet Union
and America are going to do. Just send a beautiful chariot – but that
means your strength should be something absolutely certain to you; and
not only to you, it should be certain to everybody else. Only then can
such a symbol be of any help. So every king had the desire to become a
chakravartin someday.</p><p><br></p><p>The story is that one man became a chakravartin – and it happens only
once in thousands of years that a man becomes a chakravartin. Even
Alexander the Great was not a world conqueror; there was yet much left
unconquered. And he died very young, he was only thirty-three: there was
not even time enough to conquer the world. What to say of conquering,
the whole world was not even known. Half of the world was unknown, and
the half that was known, even that was not conquered. This man, of whom
I am going to tell you the story, became the chakravartin.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that when a chakravartin dies – because a chakravartin
happens only in thousands of years, he is a rare being – when he dies he
is received in heaven with great rejoicings and he is taken to a special
place.</p><p><br></p><p>In Jaina mythology, in heaven there is a parallel mountain to the
Himalayas. The Himalayas are just made of rocks and earth and ice. The
parallel Himalayas in heaven is called Sumeru. Sumeru means the ultimate
mountain: nothing can be higher than that, nothing can be better than
that. It is solid gold; instead of rocks there are diamonds and rubies
and emeralds.</p><p><br></p><p>When a chakravartin dies he is led to Sumeru mountain to engrave his
name on it. That is a rare opportunity; that happens only once in
thousands of years. Of course this man was immensely excited that he was
going to write his name on Sumeru. That is the ultimate catalogue of all
the great ones that have been, and will also be the catalogue of all the
great ones who are going to be. This emperor was becoming party to a
lineage of supermen.</p><p><br></p><p>The gatekeeper gave him the instruments to engrave his name. He
wanted a few of his men who had committed suicide just because their
emperor was dying – they could not think of living without him. His
wife, his prime minister, his commander-in-chief – all the great people
who were around him, they all had committed suicide, so they had come
with him.</p><p><br></p><p>The emperor wanted the gatekeeper to let them all come to see him
engrave his name, because what is the joy if you go alone and engrave
your name and nobody is there even to see? – because the real joy is
that the whole world should see.</p><p>The gatekeeper said, “You listen to my advice, because this is my
inherited profession. My father was a gatekeeper, his father was a
gatekeeper; for centuries we have been gatekeepers to Sumeru mountain.
Listen to my advice: Don’t take them with you; otherwise you will
repent.”</p><p><br></p><p>The emperor could not understand, but he could not even go against
his advice – because what interest could that man have in preventing
him?</p><p><br></p><p>The gatekeeper said, “If you still want them to see, first go engrave
your name; then come back and take them with you if you want. I have no
objection even now if you want to take them, but just in case you decide
not to, then there will be no place, no chance ... they will be with
you. You go alone.” This was perfectly sane advice.</p><p><br></p><p>The emperor said, “That’s good. I will go alone, engrave my name,
come back, and call you all.” The gatekeeper said, “I am perfectly
agreeable to that.”</p><p>The emperor went and he saw the Sumeru shining under thousands of
suns – because in heaven you cannot be so poor as to have just one sun –
thousands of suns, and a golden mountain far bigger than the Himalayas –
and the Himalayas are almost two thousands miles long! He could not open
his eyes for a moment, it was so glaring there. And then he started
looking for a space, the right space, but he was very much puzzled:
there was no space; the whole mountain was engraved with names.</p><p><br></p><p>He could not believe his eyes. For the first time he became aware
what he was. Up to now he was thinking he was a superman who happens
once in thousands of years. But time has been from eternity; even
thousands of years didn’t make any difference, so many chakravartins had
happened already. There was no space on that biggest mountain in the
whole universe where he could write his small name.</p><p><br></p><p>He came back, and now he understood that the gatekeeper was right not
to take his wife and his commander-in-chief and his prime minister and
other intimate friends. It was good that they had not seen the
situation. They would still believe that their emperor was a rare
being.</p><p><br></p><p>He took the gatekeeper inside and he said, “But there is no
space!”</p><p><br></p><p>The gatekeeper said, “That’s what I was telling you. What you have to
do is to erase a few names and write down your name. That’s what has
been done; my whole life I have been seeing this done, my father used to
say this has been done. My father’s father – none of my family have seen
Sumeru empty, or any space ever.</p><p><br></p><p>“Whenever a chakravartin has come he had to erase a few names and
write his own name. So this is not the whole history of the
chakravartins. Many times it has been erased, many times it has been
engraved. You just do your work, and then if you want to show your
friends you can bring them in.”</p><p><br></p><p>The emperor said, “No, I don’t want to show them and I don’t want to
even write my name. What is the point? – someday somebody will come and
erase it.</p><p>“My whole life has become utterly meaningless. This was my only hope,
that Sumeru, the golden mountain in heaven was going to have my name.
For this I have lived, for this I have staked my life; for this I was
ready to kill the whole world. And anybody else can erase my name and
write his. What is the point of writing it? I will not write it.” The
gatekeeper laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>The emperor said, “Why are you laughing?”</p><p><br></p><p>The gatekeeper said, “This is strange, because this too I have been
hearing from my grandfathers – that chakravartins come, and seeing the
whole story, just turn back; they don’t write their names. You are not
new: anybody having a little intelligence would do the same.”</p><p><br></p><p>In this whole world what can you gain? What can you take away with
you?</p><p>Your name, your prestige, your respectability? Your money, your power
– what? Your scholarship? You cannot take anything.</p><p>Everything will have to be dropped here.</p><p><br></p><p>And in that moment you will understand that all that you possessed
was not yours; the very idea of possession was wrong. And because of
that possession you were corrupted.</p><p><br></p><p>To increase that possession – to have more money, to have more power,
to conquer more lands – you were doing things which even you cannot say
were right. You were lying, you were dishonest. You were having hundreds
of faces. You were not true even for a single moment to anybody or to
yourself; you could not be.</p><p><br></p><p>You had to be false, phony, pretending, because these are things that
help you to succeed in the world. Authenticity is not going to help you.
Honesty is not going to help you. Truthfulness is not going to help
you.</p><p><br></p><p>Without possessions, success, fame; who are you? You don’t know.</p><p>You are your name, you are your fame, you are your prestige, your
power. But other than these, who are you?</p><p><br></p><p>So this whole possessiveness becomes your identity. It gives you a
false sense of being. That’s the ego.</p><p>Ego is not something mysterious, it is a very simple phenomenon. You
don’t know who you are, and to live without knowing who you are is
impossible. If I don’t know who I am, then what am I doing here? Then
whatsoever I am doing becomes meaningless. The first and the foremost
thing</p><p>is to know who I am. Perhaps then I can do something that fulfills my
nature, makes me contented, brings me home.</p><p><br></p><p>But if I don’t know who I am, and I go on doing things, how can I
manage to reach where my nature was supposed to reach, to lead? I have
been running hither and thither but there is not going to be any point
that I can say, “Now I have arrived, this was the place I was searching
for.”</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t know who you are, so some false identity is needed as a
substitute. Your possessions give you that false identity.</p><p><br></p><p>When Alexander the Great was coming back from India he remembered
that his master, Aristotle, had asked him to bring a sannyasin from
India. Aristotle had heard about sannyasins. Rumors from business
people, travelers, adventurers, were reaching him that a strange kind of
man exists in India: the sannyasin. It was absolutely unbelievable
because a sannyasin is possible only when a certain civilization reaches
its very peak, not before that. A primitive society cannot have
sannyasins.</p><p><br></p><p>Only a very superior culture, rich, can become fed up with richness,
fed up with culture, fed up with civilization. You cannot be fed up with
something which you don’t have. To be fed up with something, you need to
have it so much that it loses all meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a continuous loss in meaning. For example: if you have one
million dollars, do you think when you have ten million dollars the
dollar will have the same value for you? It will be ten times less. But
if you have one hundred thousand million dollars, then in the same
proportion the dollar will go on losing its value for you. You can think
of a situation where the dollar loses all meaning, it becomes just dust
unto dust. But that is possible only when you have so much.</p><p><br></p><p>A country poor, hungry, starving cannot have real sannyasins. Yes,
India still has sannyasins but that is just the dead corpse of sannyas
carried on by tradition. Otherwise sannyasins disappeared at least two
thousand years ago in India – they don’t exist.</p><p><br></p><p>My effort was the first after two thousand years to bring the
sannyasin back in his true color. That became a conflict because the old
sannyasin is dead, but he holds the power of tradition, of the past; my
sannyasin is alive, but he has no power of the past, no power of
tradition, no authority from the scriptures. There was going to be
conflict. And the old were afraid: although they knew they had all the
authority, one thing was certain – that they were not alive. They may
have all the authority but they are a corpse.</p><p><br></p><p>My sannyasin may not have any authority, but he is alive, and life is
the only authority there is; hence, the fear in all different traditions
of sannyas in India against my sannyasins.</p><p><br></p><p>We were not doing any harm to anybody; we were not even concerned. We
were simply trying to live our way, not interfering with anybody, not
even trespassing on anybody’s path. But strangely, the whole of
traditional India – and the whole country is traditional – wanted to
destroy my people.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason is clear: they became aware that if we succeed in
surviving then their death has come. Then they cannot remain any more,
they will have to disappear. In fact they are living posthumously; they
should have disappeared two thousand years before. Exactly at the time
when Alexander left India, they should have disappeared.</p><p>Alexander enquired in every place he visited, “I want to see a
sannyasin. My master has requested me<span class=s4></span>I asked
him, ‘Would you like anything from India?’” – because in those days
India was the</p><p>golden bird. Everything valuable was coming from India – in fact
Europe was almost in a barbarous state. But Aristotle had asked not for
something that Alexander could have thought of, imagined. He asked a
very strange thing: “Bring a sannyasin.”</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander enquired in every place he visited, and everybody said,
“You come a little late.” It was five hundred years after Buddha that
Alexander reached India. They said, “You should have come five hundred
years before, or at least two hundred years before.</p><p><br></p><p>“If you had come five hundred years before you would have been
greeted by sannyasins everywhere; they were all over the place. They
were a strange tribe of people. Even if you had come two hundred years
before you would have found one here, one there. That great era of the
sannyasins had passed but a few remnants were still available. Now it is
very difficult, but you go on trying; perhaps somewhere you may be able
to find one.”</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander was very puzzled: he would not even be able to present to
his master the simple gift he had asked for; but finally at the border
he found a man. People said, “You have come to the right place. This is
the man.” Alexander reports in his memoirs that the man’s name was
Dandamis; that seems to be a Greek transliteration of some Indian
word.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been thinking what exactly it could be, because Dandamis is
not an Indian word. But there has been a certain group of sannyasins who
are called Danda Swami. Danda means a staff – they carry a staff – and
swami means a master of oneself. So it seems “Danda swami” somehow has
got mixed and become “Dandamis.”</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander sent his people – obviously. Alexander was a great
conqueror, emperor: he would not go to the sannyasin. The sannyasin was
just a beggar, and Alexander heard from people that he was naked and
just lived by the side of the river under a tree.</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander sent four soldiers with naked swords and told them, “Invite
the swami. Tell him, ‘Alexander the Great wants you to be his guest. He
wants to take you to his country with great respect and honor, and you
will remain there as a royal guest. This is something very special,
because Alexander has never invited anybody the way he is inviting
you.’”</p><p><br></p><p>They went, and they told Dandamis. The naked man simply laughed. He
said, “A man who calls himself Alexander the Great cannot be really
great. That is a sign of a very mean mind, to think of oneself as ‘the
Great’.”</p><p><br></p><p>The soldiers were shocked. They said, “What are you saying? Can’t you
see our naked swords?”</p><p><br></p><p>Dandamis said, “I am not blind like you, and like your Alexander the
Great. If you who are blind can see, can’t I, who am not blind, see?
Just go and tell Alexander that a sannyasin moves according to his will.
Thanks for your invitation, and in return I invite you to be here with
me, my guest under my tree, to have some taste of what sannyas is.”</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander was very angry when he heard that this had been the
response. He himself went and he said, “I am a dangerous man.”</p><p>Again the naked man laughed, and he said, “You cannot be more
dangerous than I am. If you are so dangerous, why are you carrying this
sword and having so many people around you with naked swords? Look at
me, standing naked – and you think you are dangerous? Have you come to
accept my invitation and be with me, or have you come to repeat your
invitation?”</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander said, “I have come to take you forcibly. Now it is no
longer an invitation: either you come with us, or this sword will cut
your head off and finish you right now.”</p><p><br></p><p>Dandamis laughed a third time, and he said, “That’s great! You do it,
right now. I am not moving from here. Nobody can move me against my
will. Yes, you can cut off my head because that does not belong to me,
but you cannot shake me; that is my citadel where I am absolutely the
emperor.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can cut off my head, you can cut off my hands, you can cut off
my legs, you can cut my whole body into pieces, but remember one thing:
when you are cutting my body, my head, my hands, I will be watching in
the same way as you will be watching. Your sword cannot cut me, my
watcher cannot be penetrated by a sword. So start!” he said.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is so difficult to kill such a man, who is inviting you to
kill him. Alexander said, “I am sorry that I disturbed you, but now I
know why my master asked me to bring a sannyasin. And now I also know
why I could not find a sannyasin in so many places I have been visiting.
Now I understand also why people were saying, ‘You have come five
hundred years late. The whole country was full of sannyasins; now they
are certainly a rare phenomenon.’</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know what this watcher is, but seeing you, looking at you –
your integrity, your strength – makes me feel that I have wasted my
life. Perhaps rather than conquering the whole world, if I had also
found this watcher that would have been better.”</p><p><br></p><p>You come with an innocent watcher into the world. Everybody comes in
the same way, with the same quality of consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>The question is, how did I manage so that nobody could corrupt my
innocence, clarity; from where did I get this courage? How could I
manage not to be humiliated by grown-ups and their world?</p><p><br></p><p>I have not done anything, so there is no question of how. It simply
happened, so I cannot take the credit for it.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps it happens to everybody but you become interested in other
things. You start bargaining with the grown-up world. They have many
things to give to you; you have only one thing to give, and that is your
integrity, your self-respect. You don’t have much, a single thing – you
can call it anything: innocence, intelligence, authenticity. You have
only one thing.</p><p><br></p><p>And the child is naturally very much interested in everything he sees
around. He is continuously wanting to have this, to have that; that is
part of human nature. If you look at the small child, even a just-born
baby, you can see he has started groping for something; his hands are
trying to find out something. He has started the journey.</p><p><br></p><p>In the journey he will lose himself, because you can’t get anything
in this world without paying for it. And the poor child cannot
understand that what he is giving is so valuable that if the whole
world</p><p>is on one side, and his integrity on the other side, then too his
integrity will be more weighty, more valuable. The child has no way to
know about it. This is the problem, because what he has got he has
simply got. He takes it for granted.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me tell you one story which will make it clear. One rich man,
very rich, became in the end very frustrated – which is a natural
outcome of all success. Nothing fails like success. Success is
significant only if you are a failure. Once you succeed then you know
that you have been cheated by the world, by the people, by the society.
The man had all the riches but no peace of mind. He started looking for
peace of mind.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what is happening in America. In America more people are
looking for peace of mind than anywhere else. In India I have never come
across a person who is looking for peace of mind. Peace of the stomach
has to be taken care of first – peace of mind is too far away. From the
stomach the mind is almost millions of miles away.</p><p><br></p><p>But in America everybody is looking for peace of mind, and of course
when you are looking for it, then people will be there ready to give it
to you. This is a simple law of economics: wherever there is demand
there is supply. It does not matter whether what you are asking for you
really need. Nor does anybody bother about what the supply is going to
give you – whether it is just bogus advertisement, propaganda, or
whether there is something substantial.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing this simple principle, that wherever there is demand there is
supply, the cunning and clever people have gone one step ahead. Now they
say, “There is no need to wait for demand to happen, you create the
demand.” And that is the whole art of advertisement: it is creating
demand.</p><p><br></p><p>Before you read the advertisement you had no such demand, you had
never felt that this was your need. But reading the advertisement,
suddenly you feel, “My God, I have been missing it. And I am such a fool
that I never knew that this thing exists.”</p><p><br></p><p>Before somebody starts manufacturing something, producing something,
even years ahead – three, four years ahead – he starts advertising. The
thing is not there yet in the market because first the demand has to
reach the minds of people. And once the demand is there, by that time
the supply will be ready.</p><p><br></p><p>Bernard Shaw has said that when he was new and he published his first
book, of course there was no demand – nobody had ever heard about George
Bernard Shaw. How can you demand, “I want George Bernard Shaw’s book,
his drama?” So what he used to do the whole day<span class=s4></span>He published</p><p>the book – he himself was the publisher, he put together the money
himself – and then he went from one bookstore to another bookstore
asking, “Have you got George Bernard Shaw’s book?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “George Bernard Shaw? We never heard the name.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Strange, such a great man and you have never heard of him
and you run a bookstore? Are you out-of-date or something? The first
thing you should do is get George Bernard Shaw’s book.” He had published
only one book but he started advertising for several books, because when
you are going around, why just publicize one book? And one book does not
make a man a great writer.</p><p>He would go in different clothes – sometimes with a hat, sometimes
with glasses. And people started calling at George Bernard Shaw’s house.
And he had to do all this – the advertising, supplying; that’s how he
sold his first book. He was asking people on the street, “Have you heard
... because I am hearing so much about a certain book written by some
George Bernard Shaw. People say it is just great, fantastic. Have you
heard?”</p><p><br></p><p>They would say, “No, we have never even heard the name.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “This is strange. I used to think London was a cultured
society.” And he went to libraries and clubs and every place where there
was a possibility to create a demand, and he created the demand. He sold
the book, and finally – that’s what he was continuously doing – finally
he became one of the greatest writers of this age. He had created the
demand.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you succeed, there is no need for anybody to create the demand
for peace of mind. If you succeed, you lose peace of mind on the way.
That is a natural course. Success takes all peace from your mind. It
simply sucks everything that is significant in life: peace, silence,
joy, love. It goes on taking everything away from you. Finally your
hands are full of junk, and all that was valuable is lost. And suddenly
you realize peace of mind is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Immediately there are suppliers, who don’t know anything about mind,
who don’t know anything about peace. I have read one book entitled PEACE
OF MIND by a Jewish rabbi, Joshua Liebman. I have gone through the whole
book; the man knows neither about peace nor does he know about the mind.
But he is a businessman, he is a Jew: He has done a good job without
knowing anything about peace of mind.</p><p><br></p><p>His book is one of the best sellers in the world because whoever
wants peace of mind is bound to sooner or later find Joshua Liebman’s
book. And he has written it beautifully. He is a good writer, very
articulate, impressive; you will be influenced by it. But peace of mind
will remain as far away as it was before, or it may even have gone
farther away by your reading this book.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, if man knows what peace is, and what mind is, he cannot
write a book entitled PEACE OF MIND, because mind is the cause of all
unpeace, all restlessness. Peace is when there is no mind. So peace of
mind – no commodity like this exists. If mind is there, then peace is
not. If peace is there then mind is not. But to write a book “Peace of
No Mind” ... nobody is going to purchase it. I have been thinking ...
but I thought, nobody is going to purchase “Peace of No Mind”. It just
will not make sense to them, but that’s exactly the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>The child is unaware of what he has brought with him. This rich man
was in the same position. He had all the riches in the world, and now he
was searching for peace of mind. He went from one sage to another and
they all gave great advice, but advice helps nobody.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact only fools give advice, and only fools take advice. Wise
people are very reluctant to give you advice because a wise man
certainly knows that the only thing in the world which is given freely
is advice, and that which is never taken by anybody is advice, so why
should he bother?</p><p><br></p><p>A wise man first prepares you so that you can take the advice. He
does not simply give you advice; you need to be prepared. It may take
years to prepare you, to prepare the ground, and only then</p><p>can you sow the seeds. It will be a fool who simply goes on throwing
seeds on rocks and stones without even bothering that he is wasting
seeds.</p><p><br></p><p>All these sages gave him advice but nothing clicked. Finally a man
whom he had not asked, who was not in any way a famous man – on the
contrary he was thought to be the village idiot – that man stopped him
on the road one day and said, “You are unnecessarily wasting your time:
none of these are sages. I know them perfectly, but because I am an
idiot nobody believes me. Perhaps you will also not believe me, but I
know a sage.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Just seeing you so tortured continuously for peace of mind, I
thought it would be better if I showed you the right person. Otherwise I
am an idiot; nobody asks me for advice and I never give any advice to
anybody. But it was too much: seeing you so sad and so miserable, I
broke my silence. You go to this man in the next village.”</p><p><br></p><p>The rich man immediately went, with a big bag full of precious
diamonds, on his beautiful horse. He reached there, he saw that man –
this man was known to the Sufis as Mulla Nasruddin.</p><p><br></p><p>He asked the Mulla, “Can you help me to attain peace of mind?” Mulla
said, “Help? I can give it to you.”</p><p>The rich man thought, “This is strange. First that idiot suggested
... and just out of desperation I thought there is no harm, so I came
here. This seems to be even a greater idiot: he is saying, ‘I can give
it to you.’”</p><p><br></p><p>The rich man said, “You can give it to me? I have been to all kinds
of sages; they all give advice – do this, do that, discipline yourself,
do charity, help the poor, open hospitals, this and that. They say all
these things, and in fact I have done all those things; nothing helps.
In fact more and more trouble arises. And you say you can give it to
me?”</p><p><br></p><p>The Mulla said, “It is so simple. You get down from the horse.” So
the rich man got down from the horse. He was holding his bag, and Mulla
asked, “What are you holding in your bag so closely to your heart?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “These are precious diamonds. If you can give me peace, I
will give you this bag.” But before he could even figure out what was
happening, Mulla took the bag and ran away!</p><p><br></p><p>The rich man, for a moment, was in shock; he could not even
understand what to do. And then he had to follow him. But it was Mulla’s
own town – he knew every street and shortcut, and he was running. The
rich man had never run in his whole life and he was so fat .… He was
crying and huffing and puffing, and tears were rolling down. He said, “I
have been completely cheated! This man has taken away all my life’s hard
work, my earnings; everything he has taken away.”</p><p><br></p><p>So a crowd followed, and all were laughing. He said, “Are you all
idiots? Is this town full of idiots? I have been completely ruined, and
rather than catching hold of the thief you are all laughing.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “He is not a thief, he is a very sage man.”</p><p>The rich man said, “That idiot from my village got me into this
trouble!” But somehow, running, perspiring, he followed Mulla. Mulla
arrived back under the same tree where the horse was still standing. He
sat down under the tree with the bag, and the rich man came crying and
weeping. Mulla said, “You take this bag.” The rich man took the bag and
put it close to his heart. Mulla said, “How does it feel? Can you feel
some peace of mind?”</p><p><br></p><p>The rich man said, “Yes it feels very peaceful. You are a strange
man, and you have strange methods.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla said, “No strange methods – simple mathematics. Whatever you
have, you start taking it for granted. You just have to be given an
opportunity to lose it; then immediately you will become aware of what
you have lost. You have not gained anything new; it is the same bag that
you have been carrying with no peace of mind. Now the same bag you are
holding close to your heart and anybody can see how peaceful you are
looking, a perfect sage! Just go home, and don’t bother people.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the problem for the child, because he comes with innocence
and he is ready to buy anything, and give his innocence. He is ready to
buy any rubbish and give his courage. He is ready to buy just toys – and
what else is there in this world except toys? – and lose his clarity. He
will understand only when all these toys are there in his possession and
he can’t feel any joy from them, can’t see any achievement, any
fulfillment. Then he becomes aware of what he has lost – and he himself
has lost it.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking me how I managed not to lose my innocence and clarity.
I have not done anything; just simply, from the very beginning<span class=s4></span>I was a lonely child because I was brought up by my
maternal</p><p>grandfather and grandmother; I was not with my father and mother.
Those two old people were alone and they wanted a child who would be the
joy of their last days. So my father and mother agreed: I was their
eldest child, the first-born; they sent me.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t remember any relationship with my father’s family in the
early years of my childhood. With these two old men – my grandfather and
his old servant, who was really a beautiful man – and my old grandmother
... these three people. And the gap was so big<span class=s4></span>I
was absolutely alone. It was not</p><p>a company, it could not be a company. They tried their hardest to be
as friendly to me as possible but it was just not possible.</p><p><br></p><p>I was left to myself. I could not say things to them. I had nobody
else, because in that small village my family were the richest; and it
was such a small village – not more than two hundred people in all – and
so poor that my grandparents would not allow me to mix with the village
children. They were dirty, and of course they were almost beggars. So
there was no way to have friends. That caused a great impact. In my
whole life I have never been a friend, I have never known anybody to be
a friend. Yes, acquaintances I had.</p><p><br></p><p>In those first, early years I was so lonely that I started enjoying
it; and it is really a joy. So it was not a curse to me, it proved a
blessing. I started enjoying it, and I started feeling self-sufficient;
I was not dependent on anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>I have never been interested in games for the simple reason that from
my very childhood there was no way to play, there was nobody to play
with. I can still see myself in those earliest years, just sitting.</p><p>We had a beautiful spot where our house was, just in front of a lake.
Far away for miles, the lake ... and it was so beautiful and so silent.
Only once in while would you see a line of white cranes flying, or
making love calls, and the peace would be disturbed; otherwise, it was
almost the right place for meditation. And when they would disturb the
peace – a love call from a bird ... after his call the peace would
deepen, it would become deeper.</p><p><br></p><p>The lake was full of lotus flowers, and I would sit for hours so
self-content, as if the world did not matter: the lotuses, the white
cranes, the silence .…</p><p><br></p><p>And my grandparents were very aware of one thing, that I enjoyed my
aloneness. They had continuously been seeing that I had no desire to go
to the village to meet anybody, or to talk with anybody. Even if they
wanted to talk my answers were yes, or no; I was not interested in
talking either. So they became aware of one thing, that I enjoyed my
aloneness, and it was their sacred duty not to disturb me.</p><p><br></p><p>So for seven years continuously nobody tried to corrupt my innocence;
there was nobody. Those three old people who lived in the house, the
servant and my grandparents, were all protective in every possible way
that nobody should disturb me. In fact I started feeling, as I grew up,
a little embarrassed that because of me they could not talk, they could
not be normal as everybody is. It was just the opposite situation .…</p><p><br></p><p>It happens with children that you tell them, “Be silent because your
father is thinking, your grandfather is resting. Be quiet, sit
silently.” In my childhood it happened the opposite way. Now I cannot
answer why and how; it simply happened. That’s why I said it simply
happened – the credit does not go to me.</p><p><br></p><p>All those three old people were continuously making signs to each
other: “Don’t disturb him – he is enjoying so much.” And they started
loving my silence.</p><p><br></p><p>Silence has its vibe; it is infectious, particularly a child’s
silence which is not forced, which is not because you are saying, “I
will beat you if you create any nuisance or noise.” No, that is not
silence. That will not create the joyous vibration that I am talking
about, when a child is silent on his own, enjoying for no reason; his
happiness is uncaused. That creates great ripples all around.</p><p><br></p><p>In a better world, every family will learn from children. You are in
such a hurry to teach them. Nobody seems to learn from them, and they
have much to teach you. And you have nothing to teach them.</p><p><br></p><p>Just because you are older and powerful you start making them just
like you without ever thinking about what you are, where you have
reached, what your status is in the inner world. You are a pauper; and
you want the same for your child also?</p><p><br></p><p>But nobody thinks; otherwise people would learn from small children.
Children bring so much from the other world because they are such fresh
arrivals. They still carry the silence of the womb, the silence of the
very existence.</p><p><br></p><p>So it was just a coincidence that for seven years I remained
undisturbed – no Miss Judith Martin to nag me, to prepare me for the
world of business, politics, diplomacy. My grandparents were more</p><p>interested in leaving me as natural as possible – particularly my
grandmother. She is one of the causes – these small things affect all
your life patterns – she is one of the causes of my respect for the
whole of womanhood.</p><p><br></p><p>She was a simple woman, uneducated, but immensely sensitive. She made
it clear to my grandfather and the servant: “We all have lived a certain
kind of life which has not led us anywhere. We are as empty as ever, and
now death is coming close.” She insisted, “Let this child be
uninfluenced by us. What influence can we ...? We can only make him like
us, and we are nothing. Give him an opportunity to be himself.”</p><p><br></p><p>My grandfather – I heard them discussing in the night, thinking that
I was asleep – used to say to her, “You are telling me to do this, and I
am doing it; but he is somebody else’s son, and sooner or later he will
have to go to his parents. What will they say? – ‘You have not taught
him any manners, any etiquette, he is absolutely wild.’”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “Don’t be worried about that. In this whole world everybody
is civilized, has manners, etiquette, but what is the gain? You are very
civilized – what have you got out of it? At the most his parents will be
angry at us. So what? – let them be angry. They can’t harm us, and by
that time the child will be strong enough that they cannot change his
life course.”</p><p><br></p><p>I am tremendously grateful to that old woman. My grandfather was
again and again worried that sooner or later he was going to be
responsible: “They will say, ‘We left our child with you and you have
not taught him anything.’”</p><p><br></p><p>My grandmother did not even allow ... because there was one man in
the village who could at least teach me the beginnings of language,
mathematics, a little geography. He was educated to the fourth grade –
the lowest four; that is what was called primary education in India. But
he was the most educated man in the town.</p><p><br></p><p>My grandfather tried hard: “He can come and he can teach him. At
least he will know the alphabet, some mathematics, so when he goes to
his parents they will not say that we just wasted seven years
completely.”</p><p><br></p><p>But my grandmother said, “Let them do whatsoever they want to do
after seven years. For seven years he has to be just his natural self,
and we are not going to interfere.” And her argument was always, “You
know the alphabet, so what? You know mathematics, so what? You have
earned a little money; do you want him also to earn a little money and
live just like you?”</p><p><br></p><p>That was enough to keep that old man silent. What to do? He was in a
difficulty because he could not argue, and he knew that he would be held
responsible, not she, because my father would ask him, “What have you
done?” And actually that would have been the case, but fortunately he
died before my father could ask.</p><p><br></p><p>But my father continuously was saying, “That old man is responsible,
he has spoiled the child.” But now I was strong enough, and I made it
clear to him: “Before me, never say a single word against my maternal
grandfather. He has saved me from being spoiled by you – that is your
real anger. But you have other children – spoil them. And at the final
stage you will say who is spoiled.”</p><p>He had other children, and more and more children went on coming. I
used to tease him, “You please bring one child more, make it a dozen.
Eleven children? People ask,”How many children?” Eleven does not look
right; one dozen is more impressive.”</p><p><br></p><p>And in later years I used to tell him, “You go on spoiling all your
children; I am wild, and I will remain wild.”</p><p><br></p><p>What you see as innocence is nothing but wildness. What you see as
clarity is nothing but wildness. Somehow I remained out of the grip of
civilization.</p><p><br></p><p>And once I was strong enough<span class=s4></span>And that’s why
these people – Miss Judith Martin, and their kind</p><p>– insist, “Take hold of the child as quickly as possible, don’t waste
time because the earlier you take hold of the child, the easier it is.
Once the child becomes strong enough, then to bend him according to your
desires will be difficult.”</p><p><br></p><p>And life has seven-year circles. By the seventh year the child is
perfectly strong; now you cannot do anything. Now he knows where to go,
what to do. He is capable of arguing. He is capable of seeing what is
right and what is wrong. And his clarity will be at the climax when he
is seven. If you don’t disturb his earlier years, then at the seventh he
is so crystal clear about everything that his whole life will be lived
without any repentance.</p><p><br></p><p>I have lived without any repentance. I have tried to find: Have I
done anything wrong, ever? Not that people have been thinking that all
that I have done is right, that is not the point: 97I have never thought
anything that I have done was wrong. The whole world may think it was
wrong, but to me there is absolute certainty that it was right; it was
the right thing to do.</p><p><br></p><p>So there is no question of repenting about the past. And when you
don’t have to repent about the past you are free from it. The past keeps
you entangled like an octopus because you go on feeling, “That thing I
should not have done,” or, “That thing which I was supposed to do and
did not do<span class=s4></span>”</p><p>All those things go on pulling you backwards. I don’t see anything
behind me, no past.</p><p>If I say something about my past, it is simply factual memory, it has
no psychological involvement. I am telling you as if I am telling you
about somebody else. It is just factual; it has nothing to do with my
personal involvement. It might have occurred to somebody else, it might
have happened to somebody else.</p><p><br></p><p>So remember, a factual memory is not enslaving. Psychological memory
is, and psychological memory is made up of things that you think, or you
have been conditioned to think, were wrong and you did them. Then there
is a wound, a psychological wound.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

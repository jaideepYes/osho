Astrology is perhaps the most ancient subject and also in a way the most ignored. It is the most ancient because astrology has been in existence as far back as we have been able to investigate the history of mankind. Astrological inscriptions have been found on bone remnants from the Sumerian civilization which existed twenty-five thousand years before Jesus. Bone remnants have been discovered with astrological inscriptions and with an outline of the moon's orbit in the sky."><meta name=author content="www.sacred-magick.com"><link rel=canonical href=https://osho.lol/posts/astrology__the_science_of_cosmic_oneness/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.b609c58d5c11bb90b1a54e04005d74ad1ddf22165eb79f5533967e57df9c3b50.css integrity="sha256-tgnFjVwRu5CxpU4EAF10rR3fIhZet59VM5Z+V9+cO1A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate type=application/rss+xml href=https://osho.lol/posts/astrology__the_science_of_cosmic_oneness/index.xml><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://osho.lol/posts/astrology__the_science_of_cosmic_oneness/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="Astrology -

most ignored. It is the most ancient because astrology has been in
existence as far back as we have been able to investigate the history of
mankind. Astrological inscriptions have been found on bone remnants from
the Sumerian civilization which existed twenty-five thousand years
before Jesus. Bone remnants have been discovered with astrological
inscriptions and with an outline of the moon's orbit in the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>But in India this science is even older. In the <em>Rigveda</em>
reference is made to a certain constellation of the stars which could
only have occurred ninety-five thousand years ago. Because of this,
Lokmanya Tilak concluded that the Vedas must certainly be even
<em>rrwre</em> ancient: the constellation of the stars as the Vedas
describe it could only have occurred at a certain moment ninety-five
thousand years ago; so that particular vedic reference must be at least
ninety-five thousand years old.</p><p><br></p><p>That particular vedic reference could not have been added at a later
period. Other, younger generations would not have been able to work out
a constellation that existed many years before. But now we have
scientific methods which we can use to discover where the stars were at
a particular moment in the distant past.</p><p><br></p><p>The deepest laws of astrology were first discovered in India. In fact
it was only because of astrology that mathematics was born. To make
astrological calculations, first mathematics was needed.</p><p><br></p><p>The digits used in arithmetic were invented in India -- the numbers
one to ten, which exist in all the world's languages, are basically
Indian in origin. And throughout the world the decimal system has been
accepted: the decimal system was born in India, and it slowly spread
throughout the entire world. When you say "nine" in English, it is
simply a modification of the Sanskrit word <em>nav</em>. When you say
"eight" in English, it is simply a modification of the Sanskrit word
<em>aht</em>. The numerals one to nine, prevalent in all the world's
languages, came into existence only because of the influence of Indian
astrology.</p><p><br></p><p>The first knowledge about the existence of astrology reached the
Sumerian civilization from India.</p><p><br></p><p>Six thousand years before Jesus, the Sumerians were the first to open
the doors of astrology to the Western world. The Sumerians laid the
foundation for the scientific study of the constellation. They
constructed a gigantic tower, seven hundred feet tall, and from that
tower Sumerian priests used to observe the sky twenty-four hours a day.
Sumerian metaphysicians soon learned that whatever happens to mankind is
somehow ultimately connected with the stars -- they are the source.</p><p><br></p><p>Six thousand years before Jesus, it was the view in Sumeria that
whenever illness occurs, whenever epidemics are born, the stars are
somehow connected. These days there is a</p><p>scientific basis for this view. And those who understand the science
of astrology today say it was the Sumerians who began the history of
mankind.</p><p><br></p><p>In 1920, a Russian scientist, Chijevsky, investigated this matter
deeply and discovered that every eleven years enormous explosions take
place on the sun. Every eleven years a nuclear explosion occurs on the
sun. Chijevsky discovered that whenever such nuclear explosions occur on
the sun, wars and revolutions begin on Earth. According to him, during
the past seven hundred years, whenever such phenomena have occurred on
the sun, there have been disasters on Earth.</p><p><br></p><p>Chijevsky's analysis was undeniable and, because it went against the
Marxist viewpoint, in 1920 Stalin had him arrested and thrown into
prison. Only after Stalin's death could Chijevsky be released. For
Stalin, Chijevsky's conclusions must have seemed very strange. According
to Marxist and communist thinking, whatever revolutions occur on the
Earth are fundamentally caused by economic differences between men. But
Chijevsky declared that the cause of revolutions is the explosions
happening on the sun.</p><p>How can explosions on the sun possibly be related to the existence of
poverty or wealth in the lives of men?</p><p><br></p><p>If Chijevsky's thesis is correct, then Marx's entire system
disintegrates into dust. Then you cannot explain revolutions any longer
in reference to economics and class struggle; then only astrology can
explain revolution.</p><p><br></p><p>Chijevsky could not be proved wrong. His calculation covering seven
hundred years was so scientific, the connection he established between
explosions on the sun and phenomena on the Earth was so close, that to
prove him wrong was difficult. But to send him to Siberia was a simple
matter.</p><p><br></p><p>After Stalin's death Khrushchev released Chijevsky from Siberia.
Nearly fifty valuable years of this man's life were lost in Siberia.
After his release he only lived another four to six months, but in those
few months he gathered together even more evidence for his thesis. He
also linked the spread of epidemics on the Earth to solar influence.</p><p><br></p><p>The sun is not a static ball of fire as we ordinarily think, but
rather an infinitely alive and dynamic, fiery organism. The sun changes
its mood every moment. And when the sun changes its mood even a little,
life on Earth is affected. Nothing happens on the Earth without
something happening on the sun. When there is a solar eclipse, the birds
in the forest stop singing twenty-four hours before. During the entire
time of the eclipse the whole Earth becomes silent. The birds stop their
singing and all of the animals in the forest become oppressed and
frightened, full of apprehension. The monkeys abandon their trees and
come down below. They form themselves into groups, apparently as a means
of protection. And it is a surprising thing that these monkeys, who are
always gossiping and making a hue and cry, become so quiet at the time
of the eclipse that even meditators cannot compare with them.</p><p><br></p><p>Chijevsky explained this entire matter, but such thinking first
originated in Sumeria. Afterwards, a Swiss physician named Paracelsus
discovered more information. He made an unparalleled discovery -- and
this discovery will transform all of medical science, if not today</p><p>then tomorrow. Up until now this discovery could not be considered
valid because astrology is such an ignored subject -- the most ancient,
the most ignored, and the most respected at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>Last year in France, it was calculated that forty-seven percent of
the population believes that astrology is a science.</p><p>In America, five thousand leading astrologers are currently at work
night and day.</p><p><br></p><p>They have so many clients that they can never finish their work
properly -- Americans pay millions of dollars yearly to astrologers. It
is estimated that throughout the world, seventy- eight percent of people
believe in astrology. The seventy-eight percent who believe in astrology
belong to the general public. Thinkers and intellectuals are on red
alert at the very mention of astrology.</p><p><br></p><p>C. G. Jung said that university doors have been closed to astrology
for three hundred years, but that in the coming thirty years these doors
will again open and astrology will enter the university. It will happen
because claims that astrology has made, which have up to now been
unproved, can now be proved.</p><p><br></p><p>Paracelsus gave birth to one discovery -- that man becomes ill only
when the harmonious relationship between himself and the constellation
of stars at his birth somehow breaks down. For this, a little
explanation is necessary. Many years before Paracelsus, some six hundred
years BC, Pythagoras gave birth to the very valuable principle of
planetary harmony. When Pythagoras proclaimed this principle in Greece
he had just returned from a journey to Egypt and India. At the time when
he came, India was intensely absorbed in the ideas of Buddha and
Mahavir. After his return to Greece, he included in his reports a
specific reference to Buddhist and Jaina monks. He gave the Jaina monks
the name Jainosophists, and also reported that they walk about
naked.</p><p><br></p><p>Pythagoras believed that every star, every planet and every satellite
gives out a unique vibration through its movement as it travels in
space.</p><p><br></p><p>Every movement of the stars gives out a vibration, and every star has
its own individual movement. All the vibrations of the stars together
make a musical harmony which he called the harmony of the universe.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are born, the melody that is created by the tuning of the
stars at that time is inscribed on your mind in its freshest, most
unsophisticated, and most sensitive state -- that of birth. Throughout
your life this will cause good health or ill health. When you live in
tune with the original musical harmony that existed at the time of your
birth, then you are healthy. And whenever your tuning with this
fundamental musical harmony breaks down, you become ill.</p><p><br></p><p>In this connection Paracelsus has done very significant work. He
would not prescribe medicine to any patient until he had seen his
<em>kundali</em>, his astrological birth chart. And it is a surprising
thing that after having examined a patient's birth chart, Paracelsus
would cure patients who</p><p>had confused other physicians -- patients who could not be cured by
any other physician. He used to say: "Until I know the position of the
stars at the time of this man's birth, it is not possible to know the
notes of his inner harmony. And unless I know the arrangement of his
inner harmony, how can I make this man healthy?"</p><p><br></p><p>But what is meant by health? This we must try to understand.
Ordinarily, if we ask a physician what the definition of health is, he
will only say that health is the absence of sickness. But this is a
negative definition. It is unfortunate that we must define health in
terms of illness. Health is a positive thing, a positive state; illness
is negative. Health is our nature; illness is an attack on nature. So it
is very strange that we must define health in terms of illness. To
define the host in terms of the guest is very strange.</p><p>Health coexists with us; illness comes occasionally.</p><p><br></p><p>Health accompanies us at birth; illness is a superficial phenomenon.
But if we ask a physician to define health, he can only say that health
is present when illness is absent.</p><p><br></p><p>Paracelsus used to say that this interpretation is wrong -- the
concept of health needs to be positively defined. But how can we reach a
positive definition, an interpretation of the concept of health that
will be creative?</p><p><br></p><p>Paracelsus used to say: "Until the state of your inner harmony is
known, you can at best only be released from your illness -- because
your inner harmony is the source of your health. But when you are
released from one illness you will immediately get another, because
nothing has been done about your inner harmony. Your inner harmony has
to be supported."</p><p><br></p><p>Five hundred years have passed since Paracelsus, and his discoveries
disappeared into oblivion. But now, during the past twenty years,
astrology has re-emerged. During this time a new science has been born.
I will describe this new science a bit, and then you will be able to
understand the ancient science of astrology more easily.</p><p><br></p><p>In 1950 a new science was born called cosmic chemistry. The
originator of this science is Georgi Giardi, one of the most significant
men of the century. After endless experiments in the laboratory, this
man proved scientifically that the whole universe is an organic unity --
that the whole universe is one body. If my finger is hurt, then my whole
body is affected. The body means that no limb is separate, all are
joined together. If my eye is in pain, then my big toe also experiences
that pain. If my foot is hurt, the message reaches the heart. If my mind
is ill, my entire body will be disturbed. If my whole body is destroyed,
then it will be difficult for my mind to find anywhere to be. The body
is an organic unity: touch a single part and the whole body vibrates;
all parts are affected.</p><p>Cosmic chemistry says that the entire cosmos is a body.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing in it stands alone, all things are joined together. So no
matter how distant a star may be from us, when it changes, our
heartbeats also change. And no matter how far away the sun may be, when
it becomes very disturbed our blood circulation is also disturbed. Every
eleven years an atomic storm occurs on the sun. The last time such a
great atomic storm and fiery</p><p>explosions were going on, a Japanese doctor named Tamatto made an
amazing discovery.</p><p><br></p><p>This doctor had been doing work on women's blood for twenty years.
There is one property unique to female blood which is absent in the
blood of males. At the time of menstruation the blood of women becomes
thin, but men's blood always remains the same. Women's blood at the time
of menstruation grows thin; at the time of pregnancy also their blood
grows thin. According to Tamatto, this is the one basic difference
between the blood of men and women. But when atomic energy storms were
occurring on the sun with great intensity, the blood of men also grew
thin. This was a very novel phenomenon. Before this it had never been
recorded that men's blood was affected by disturbances on the sun. And
if blood can be so affected, then anything can be affected.</p><p><br></p><p>There is an American thinker, Frank Brown, who has been working on
the safety and facility aspects of space travelers. For half his life,
he has made it his task to ensure that the men who travel into space
will face no difficulty. The most serious problem is how they will be
affected as they leave the Earth. No one knows how much atomic radiation
they may encounter or how it may affect them.</p><p><br></p><p>For two thousand years after Aristotle, in the West it was thought
that space is empty, that nothing is there: two hundred miles away from
Earth the atmosphere ceases and there is empty space. But the
investigations of space travelers have proved this notion to be wrong.
Space is not empty, it is very full. It is neither empty nor dead -- it
is extremely alive.</p><p><br></p><p>The truth is that the two-hundred mile wide layer of the Earth's
atmosphere prevents many harmful influences from reaching us. But in
space all kinds of strange currents are flowing, the effects of which
man may not be able to withstand.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised to learn this, and you will laugh, but before
he would let a man be sent into space, Frank Brown sent a potato into
space. It was Brown's contention that there is very little essential
difference between a man and a potato. If the potato rots, then man
cannot survive; if the potato survives, then man may also survive. The
potato is a very hardy organism, and man is very sensitive. If even a
potato cannot survive in space, then there is no hope of survival for
man. If a potato returns alive, and if it sprouts after being sown in
the ground, then man can be sent into space. However, there would still
be concern about man's ability to survive.</p><p><br></p><p>From his experiment Brown proved one more thing -- that a potato seed
lying in the ground, or any seed lying in the ground, grows only in
relation to the sun. The sun alone arouses it and encourages it to
emerge. The sun alone summons the embryo plant and induces its
growth.</p><p><br></p><p>Brown also did research in another field. This other subject has even
now not been given a suitable name, but at present it is called
planetary heredity. There is another word in English, horoscope, which
comes from the Greek <em>hwrwscwpws</em>. The meaning of the word
horoscopos is: I observe the emerging planets.</p><p>At the moment a child is born, many stars are emerging all around the
Earth's horizon.</p><p>Just as the sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening, so
stars rise and set in space twenty-four hours a day. If a child is being
born at six o'clock in the morning, at that time the sun too is rising.
At that time some stars are also rising, and other stars are setting.
Some constellations are ascending, some constellations are on the
decline. This child is being born into a certain arrangement of stars in
space.</p><p><br></p><p>Up until now we have doubted -- and even now many people not deeply
familiar with the subject still doubt -- that the moon and stars can
have anything to do with man. Wherever the stars may be, what difference
will it make to some child being born in a village? And then too, on the
same date, under the same constellation, not just one child but
thousands of children are born Among these one may become the president
of some country, but the remainder</p><p>will not. Among these one may die after one hundred years, and
another after two days. Among these one will be a genius and one will be
an idiot. So from a superficial viewpoint, one might ask how a child can
be related to a horoscope just by being born under a certain
constellation and planetary pattern.</p><p><br></p><p>The logic of such a question seems clear and direct: Why would the
stars be concerned with the birth of a single child? And then also, not
just one child is born; under the very same stars many are born who are
not all alike. From such logic it seems that the birth of a human being
has no connection with the stars.</p><p><br></p><p>But from the investigations of Brown, Picardi, Tamatto and others, we
can draw a great conclusion. All these scientists say that while we
cannot yet claim that a child as an individual is influenced by the
stars still we can now say for certain that life as a whole is
affected.</p><p>Whether a child is influenced as an individual we cannot now say or
know, but life as a whole is. And if life as a whole is, then as we
investigate the facts of the matter more deeply, we will discover that
the individual too, is affected by the stars.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing more must be considered. It has been thought that astrology
is a science which, because it originated in an earlier time, could not
develop. But in my view the situation is just the opposite. Astrology
was an infinitely developed science in some extremely advanced
civilization, but that civilization has been lost and only incomplete
fragments of its astrology have remained in our hands.</p><p><br></p><p>Astrology is not a new science which needs to be developed, but a
science which was at one time very advanced.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the civilization which developed it was lost. Civilizations come
and go every day; the fundamentals, the basic sayings and the basic
principles of those things which have been developed by them, become
lost. Today, science is approaching the point where it will accept the
thesis that life as a whole is affected by the movements of the
stars.</p><p><br></p><p>At the time of birth, the condition of a child's mind is exactly like
a very sensitive photo plate. Two or three things need to be thought
about if we want to understand how life is affected. And only if life is
affected can there be the possibility of astrology -- not otherwise.</p><p><br></p><p>We should try to understand the phenomenon of twins. Two types of
twins exist: One is identical twins -- those who are born from one egg;
the other type is of those who, although</p><p>they are twins, are born from separate eggs -- in the mother's womb
two eggs become fertilized, and two children are born. The first type is
more rare -- two children from one egg. They are very significant
subjects to study because they are born at the same time. Out of
necessity we call the children born from separate eggs twins, but the
moment of their birth is not exactly the same.</p><p><br></p><p>It must be understood that birth is an ambiguous phenomenon. The
first aspect of birth is conception -- the actual birth takes place on
the day when the fetus is conceived in the mother's womb. This is the
actual birth. What you call birth is really birth number two -- when the
child comes out of the mother's womb.</p><p><br></p><p>If we were to carry out a complete astrological investigation -- as
the Hindus alone have done, and done very thoroughly -- then our actual
concern would not begin when the child is born. Our actual concern
begins when the child starts its journey in the mother's womb, when the
conception takes place -- because that is the actual birth. So Hindus
have also come to feel that if a particular type of child is to be born,
it will be born if intercourse and pregnancy occur under an arrangement
of planets and constellation most suitable for that type. Now I will
explain to you a little of the background of this, because much work has
been done in this area and many things have become clear.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily, when a child was born at six o'clock in the morning, we
thought that the constellation which existed at that time influences the
child. But those who know astrology deeply say that the stars do not
cast their influence over a child just because it is born at six o'clock
in the morning. No, rather, the child chooses to be born under those
stars which will influence him as he wishes to be influenced. This is a
radically different thing.</p><p>When the child is taking birth, it chooses the planets and stars, and
the moment at which it will take birth.</p><p><br></p><p>And if we go still more deeply, then the child also chooses the time
of its conception.</p><p><br></p><p>Every soul chooses its own time of conception -- when it will accept
a womb, at which moment. The moment of conception is not insignificant.
It is significant in that it is a question of how the entire universe
exists at that moment, and to what sort of possibilities the universe
opens the door at that moment.</p><p><br></p><p>When two children are conceived together from one egg, then the
moment of their conception is the same and the moment of their birth is
the same. It is interesting that the lives of the two children who have
taken birth from one egg are so alike, that it is difficult to say that
the moment of birth has no influence. The IQ of twins born from one egg
is just about equal. And those who know, say that the fractional
difference which arises is because of our faulty measuring devices. Even
today we have not been able to develop adequate criteria by which we can
quantitatively measure intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>If twins born from the same egg are brought up far apart from each
other, their IQs still do not differ. Even if one child is raised in
India and another in China, and neither is aware of the existence of the
other, this will still be true. Cases have occurred where such twins
have been raised far apart from each other until they have attained
maturity, but their IQs did not differ.</p><p>It is surprising that the IQ can be associated with the child's
potential at birth.</p><p><br></p><p>When the twin who lives in China suffers from a cold, at that time
its twin in India also suffers from a cold. Generally, twins born from
one egg die in the same year. At the most, three years elapse between
their deaths, and at the least, three days -- but never more than three
years. If one twin has died, then we can assume that after three days or
within three years the other will die. Their attitudes, their behavior,
their feelings are parallel, and it seems that the two live in almost
exactly the same way. Their similarity is seen in many other things also
-- each acts like a copy of the other.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone's skin is individual. If my hand is damaged and new skin
needs to be grafted, then your skin cannot be grafted onto my hand; it
will be necessary to use a piece of my own skin. On the entire Earth,
there will be no one whose skin can be grafted onto my hand. My body
will give signs of rejection; it will not accept another's skin.
However, the skin of twins born out of one egg <em>can</em> be
transplanted. This is the only exception. If the skin of one is grafted
onto the skin of the other, the other's body will not reject it. Why is
that? What is the cause? We cannot say that it is because they have the
same parents, because even though two brothers may have the same
parents, their skins are not interchangeable. The only exception is
found in those children who were conceived at the same moment. Even
between them no other common factor exists.</p><p><br></p><p>Their brothers also came from the same mother and father, but their
skins cannot be interchanged -- the skin of one brother cannot be
grafted onto another brother's body. Only the moment of their births
differ; the mother and father are the same, everything else is the same.
They differ greatly in only one thing, and that is the moment of their
conception.</p><p><br></p><p>Is the moment of birth so influential that the life span is of about
the same length, that their IQs are almost equal, that their bodily
behavior is the same, that when the two fall ill it is from the same
illness, and that when the two become well again, it is from the same
medicine? Can the moment of birth be so influential?</p><p>Astrology has been saying that the moment of birth is even more
important than this.</p><p><br></p><p>Up until now science has not agreed with astrology, but it is now
beginning to do so. In coming to this increasing agreement, some new
experiments have been helpful.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, when we launched man-made satellites into space, we
discovered that a wide range of radioactive rays from space, and the
constellations are continuously bombarding the Earth. Nothing on the
Earth is unaffected by this phenomenon. We know that the ocean is
influenced by the moon, but we have not taken into consideration the
fact that the same proportion of water and salt that occurs in the ocean
also occurs in the human body -- the same proportion. Seventy percent of
the human body consists of water, and the proportion of salt contained
in that water is the same as is contained in the Arabian Sea. If the
water in the ocean is affected by the moon, then how could the water
inside the human body remain unaffected?</p><p><br></p><p>Now in this connection, two or three facts emerging from recent
investigations must be kept in mind. For example, as the day of the full
moon approaches, the amount of insanity in the</p><p>world increases, whereas on the last day of the darker fourteen days,
the least number of people go insane. As the moon grows brighter the
level of insanity also begins to increase. On the day of the full moon,
the greatest number of people enter madhouses; and on the last day of
the moon's waning period, the greatest number of people are discharged
from madhouses. Statistics are now available.â¦</p><p><br></p><p>In English there is the word lunatic; in Hindi we have the word
<em>chaandrrara</em>. <em>Chaand</em> refers to the moon, just as lunar
does in English. <em>Chaandrrara</em> is a very ancient term, and the
word lunatic also is some three thousand years old. Some three thousand
years ago, people realized that the moon affects the insane. But if it
affects the insane, then how can it avoid affecting the sane?</p><p>In the final analysis, the construction of the brain and the internal
composition of the body are the same for all.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, it may be that the moon affects the insane to a greater extent,
and the sane to a lesser extent, but this is simply a quantitative
difference. It is impossible that the sane remain completely unaffected
by the moon. If that was true, then nobody would go mad -- because
everyone who goes mad was once sane. The moon must first affect those
who are sane.</p><p><br></p><p>Professor Brown made an interesting study. He was a man completely
without faith in astrology. He was a skeptic, and in his earlier
writings he had very much ridiculed astrology. Yet despite his
skepticism he began some investigation. He gathered together the birth
charts of many famous generals, doctors, and other professionals. But
then he found himself in great difficulty because he discovered that
members of particular professions were born under a specific planet,
under the same constellation. For instance, among all famous generals
the influence of Mars upon their lives is very strong, whereas in the
lives of academics the influence of Mars is completely absent.</p><p><br></p><p>The study which Brown carried out on some fifty thousand men who were
army officers reveals that the influence of Mars is very strong in the
lives of these men. Generally, when such personalities take birth, the
planet Mars is ascending. The moment of their birth is the moment that
Mars begins to rise. Exactly opposite to this, no matter how many
pacifists were studied, they were never born at the time when the planet
Mars was ascending. If it happened only occasionally, you could think it
a coincidence, but there cannot be thousands of cases of coincidence.
Mathematicians are born under a specific constellation; poets are never
born under this same constellation. In an occasional case there may be a
coincidence, but when it happens so often it cannot be a
coincidence.</p><p><br></p><p>Mathematicians are born under a specific constellation; poets are
never born under this same constellation. In an occasional case there
may be a coincidence, but when it happens so often it cannot be a
coincidence.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, there is a great difference in behavior among people of
different professions and occupations -- for example, between poets,
mathematicians, warmongers, generals and pacifists. On the one hand,
there may be a man like Bertrand Russell who says that there should be
peace in the world, and on the other hand, a man like Nietzsche who says
that the day war ceases the world will cease to be meaningful. Is it
only an intellectual dispute</p><p>between them, or also a dispute of the stars? Is there only an
intellectual dispute between them, or does the moment of their births
also separate them?</p><p>The more research is done, the more it is being realized that the
special talents of a person are revealed by the time of his birth.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who know about astrology even superficially would say that this
happens because he is born under a specific constellation. But I want to
say to you that man chooses the constellation under which he is to be
born. He will be born under the appropriate constellation according to
what he wants to be -- whatever his innate possibilities, whatever the
shape of his last life taken in its entirety, whatever his motivating
consciousness. Every child, every new life, insists on a specific moment
for birth. It wants to be born at a specific moment; it wants to be
conceived at a specific moment -- both are interdependent.</p><p><br></p><p>As I have told you, the water of the ocean is subject to certain
influences. But all life is created out of water; without water, no life
is possible. In ancient Greece, philosophers used to say that only from
water is life born, that water is life. Ancient Indian, Chinese and
other mythologies also say this. Today scientists who believe in
evolution also say that life was born in the water, that perhaps the
first life on the planet lived in the water as algae. This was the first
form of life, and then out of this, man eventually evolved.</p><p><br></p><p>Water is the most mysterious element of all. Whatever influences
reach man from the stars, from the universe, from outer space, reach him
through the medium of water. Only after affecting the water in a man's
body, can any radiation gain access to him. Much work is being done with
water, and many mysteries concerning water are coming to man's
attention.</p><p><br></p><p>The biggest mystery about water which has come to the attention of
scientists in the last ten years, is that water possesses a lot of
sensitivity. Whatever influences are active, from whatever direction in
life, they first move through the medium of water. The water in us is
the first thing to be affected. Once the water in us is influenced, then
it is very difficult for us to avoid being influenced.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised to learn that when the child floats in the
mother's womb, he floats just as if he were in the ocean. The water in
which the child floats in the mother's womb possesses the same
proportion of salt as is present in the ocean. Influences from the
mother's body do not reach the child directly; there is no direct
connection between the mother and the child growing in her womb. The
medium is water; whatever influences reach the child from the mother, do
so through the medium of water -- there is no direct relationship. Then
throughout our lives the water in our bodies behaves just like the water
in the sea.</p><p><br></p><p>Fish in the ocean have been much studied. There are fish which come
onto the seashore and lay their eggs at low tide when the ocean is
receding. Riding with the waves the fish come onto the sand, lay their
eggs, and return with the ocean waves. At a fixed time the tide returns,
and by then the eggs will have hatched, and the spawn will have come
out. Then the incoming tide will take the spawn back out to sea.</p><p>Scientists who studied these fish were very surprised, because the
fish always come to lay</p><p>their eggs at low tide.</p><p><br></p><p>Scientists are very puzzled as to how these fish know when it is
going to be low tide. If there were even the slightest mistake in
timing, the eggs would be washed away. But in hundreds of thousands of
years they have never made a mistake. If they had made a mistake they
would have disappeared as a species. But they have never made a mistake.
What equipment do these fish possess by which they can know about the
tides? What sense organ do they possess that tells them when the tide
will ebb? A hundred thousand fish will be gathered together at one time
over the entire seashore These fish must possess some kind of signaling
system, some</p><p>kind of transmitter. A hundred thousand fish will come from thousands
of miles away to lay their eggs on the ocean beach -- and all at the
same time.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who have studied the phenomenon say that there can be no source
of information other than the moon. The moon is the source of the fish's
intuition, nothing else -- the fish know intuitively when the tide is
ebbing and when it is rising. The impact of the moon is the only way
they have of knowing the tides.</p><p><br></p><p>There was another possibility. It has been conjectured that these
fish might somehow be influenced by the waves of the ocean. So
scientists put them in a place where there are no ocean waves: in water,
in an unlit room. But the results turned out to be really surprising.
The fish were enveloped in darkness, the moon was not in view -- there
was no light visible at all -</p><p>- but when the moon reached the exact point at which the fish in the
ocean would go and lay their eggs on the shore, at exactly the same
moment the fish in the laboratory laid their eggs. What does this fact
show ? That it is not a question of the ocean waves.</p><p><br></p><p>Someone may suggest that the race only begins when the fish receive
signals from each other, but this hypothesis does not hold water.
Scientists have witnessed the fish when they were isolated from each
other. They have tried to disturb the brains of these fish in every
way.</p><p>They have placed the fish in darkness for twenty-four hours, so that
the fish do not know when it is morning and when it is night. They have
observed these fish after placing them under a bright light for
twenty-four hours so that the fish would not know when it is day. They
have observed them after setting up an artificial moon, and daily either
decreasing or increasing its brilliance -- but these fish could not be
fooled. When the real moon came to the right point, only at that moment
the fish laid their eggs; wherever they were, they would lay their eggs
at that moment.</p><p>Every year hundreds of thousands of birds fly thousands and thousands
of miles.</p><p><br></p><p>Winter is on its way and soon snow will fall, so the birds begin to
migrate from the areas where snow will fall. They will fly to a place
thousands of miles away to reach this winter home. So these birds
migrate exactly one month before the coming of the snow. At the time
they are migrating the snow has not yet begun to fall, but exactly a
month later it will fall.</p><p>How do these birds calculate the date on which snow will fall? Our
weathermen, who have the most elaborate observatories, cannot come up
with such exact information.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that some weathermen first ask astrologers sitting on
the roadside: "What do you think -- will it rain today or not?"</p><p>The arrangements which man has made seem childish. Birds know a month
and a half, even two months before the first snow falls. After thousands
of experiments it has been observed that the day on which birds migrate
is fixed for every type of bird. And every year the date changes,
because there is no fixed date for snow to fall. But it is certain that
every bird will migrate one month before the snow falls. If snow is to
fall ten days later than in the previous year, they will migrate ten
days later than they did in that year. If the snow falls ten days
earlier, they will have migrated ten days earlier. If the date of the
first snowfall is uncertain, then how are these birds informed?</p><p><br></p><p>In Japan there is a bird which will evacuate a town twenty-four hours
before an earthquake occurs. It is just an ordinary town bird -- there
are many of them in every town -- but twenty- four hours before an
earthquake these birds will evacuate the town. At present, scientists
are unable to accurately predict whether an earthquake is coming even
two hours beforehand; two hours before they are still uncertain, they
are still unsure. There is only a probability, a possibility, that an
earthquake may happen. But in Japan people know twenty-four hours in
advance that an earthquake is coming. When this bird flies away, the
people of the town know that now there is only twenty-four hours' time.
The bird has left -- not a single one of this species remains in the
town. How does this bird come to know?</p><p><br></p><p>For ten years now, scientists have been saying something new: that
every living organism possesses an internal sensor which feels the
cosmic influences. Perhaps man too possesses it, but has lost awareness
of it through depending on his intellect.</p><p>Man is the only living being in the world who has, through his
so-called intelligence, lost many things which he once had.</p><p><br></p><p>Through the same intelligence he has also obtained many things he
never had before -- but the outcome is that he has ended up in danger of
self-destruction. What he had he has lost, and what he did not have he
has invented. But even the tiniest living organisms possess an inner
intuitive source, and now scientific data is becoming available which
proves that such an inner source exists. The discovery of an inner
source makes us aware that there is nothing alive on Earth which is
isolated or separate -- everything is joined to the cosmos. Whatever
happens anywhere, the effects of it are felt here.</p><p>I was talking about Paracelsus Present-day physicians are also coming
to the conclusion that</p><p>whenever sunspots emerge and grow on the sun, illness on the Earth
increases, and that whenever the sunspots decrease, illness on the earth
also decreases. As long as sunspots continue to happen we will never get
rid of disease on Earth. Every eleven years there is great turmoil on
the sun and huge explosions take place. Whenever explosions and turmoil
occur on the sun, wars and disturbances occur on Earth. The wars that
take place on Earth follow a ten-year cycle. Epidemics also follow a ten
or eleven-year cycle. Revolutions also follow an approximately ten or
eleven-year cycle.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you have become aware that we are not separate or isolated but
joined together in an organic way, then it will be easy to understand
astrology. This is why I am explaining all this to you.</p><p>In the past some people have thought, and even now think, that
astrology is superstition and</p><p>blind faith. To a great extent this seems to be true. Those things
for which it is difficult to find a scientific explanation seem to us to
be based only on blind faith. But astrology is very scientific. The
meaning of science is the investigation of the relationship between
cause and effect. Astrology says that whatever happens on this earth is
not uncaused; however, we may not be aware of the causes. Astrology says
that the shape which the future will take can-not be isolated from the
past but must be connected to it: what you become tomorrow will be
connected to what you are today; what you were until today is connected
to what you will be tomorrow.</p><p>Astrology is a very scientific way of thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>It maintains that the future will emerge only out of the past: your
today has emerged out of your yesterday and your tomorrow will emerge
out of your today. Astrology also maintains that whatever happens
tomorrow is in some subtle way present even today. Now try to understand
a little about this.</p><p><br></p><p>Three days before his assassination, Abraham Lincoln had a dream that
he had been murdered, and that his corpse was lying in a special room in
the White House. He even noted the number of the room. At that point his
sleep was broken, and when he woke up he laughed.</p><p>He said to his wife: "I dreamed that I was murdered and that my body
was lying in room number such-and-such, and in the such-and-such wing of
the White House" -- he was sleeping in that wing of the White House.
"You stood at my head, and these people were standing all around."</p><p><br></p><p>It was a joke, a laughing matter to him. Lincoln and his wife went
back to sleep. Three days later Lincoln's assassination took place.
Three days later his body was lying in that number room, in that very
place, and people were standing around his body in that sequence</p><p><br></p><p>If what was to occur three days later had not in some way already
occurred, then how could such a dream have taken place? How could the
dream resemble what actually took place, in such detail? Such a glimpse
is only given in a dream if in some way it is already existent in the
present moment. Only then can we get a glimpse of what will take place
in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>If we open the window of the present we will be able to see that the
future is just outside this window. It is the hypothesis of astrology
that the future is simply our ignorance -- hence we call it "the
future". If we were able to see it, then the future would not happen for
us -- we would know it is already present here and now.</p><p>There is an incident in Mahavir's life over which there has been much
dispute.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of this dispute a group of his disciples broke away from him
in his very presence. Because of this dispute, five hundred of Mahavir's
monks created a separate order. Mahavir used to say that whatever is
happening has in some sense already happened: if you are walking, then
in a sense you have already arrived at the destination; if you are
growing old, then in a sense you have already grown old. Mahavir used to
say that whatever is happening, whatever is in process, has already
occurred.</p><p>One long-time disciple of Mahavir lived far away from him during the
monsoon. He was sick, so he asked a newer disciple who was present to
spread out a mat for him. So the newer disciple began to spread out the
mat and he was just unfolding the rolled-up mat when the older disciple
remembered Mahavir's saying. He said: "Stop: Mahavir says that what is
happening has already happened."</p><p><br></p><p>The mat was in the process of being rolled out but it had not yet
been completely opened. It had suddenly occurred to him that Mahavir had
said a very wrong thing. The mat was half- opened, but in what sense was
it already completely opened?</p><p><br></p><p>He left the mat there. After the monsoon he went to Mahavir and said:
"You are mistaken when you say that what is happening has already
happened, because right now the mat is lying half-opened. It was being
opened but it has not been opened. So I have come to prove that your
saying is wrong."</p><p><br></p><p>Mahavir told him that he had not understood what he had said. This
disciple must have had a very childish mind, otherwise he would not have
spoken that way. Mahavir said: "You have stopped the process. It was
happening but you interrupted it. The mat which you prevented from
unfolding was already actualizing itself in the very process of
unfolding. It had, in fact, already been actualized. You only saw the
mat in the process of unfolding, but one more process was going on, and
that is what has already happened. Now for how long will your mat remain
folded? It is becoming opened, and it will open. You go back."</p><p><br></p><p>When the disciple returned he saw that a man had opened the mat and
was lying on it, resting. This man had upset everything; he had
destroyed the disciple's whole theory.</p><p><br></p><p>When Mahavir was saying that whatever is happening has already
happened, he was saying that whatever is happening is the present,
whatever may be is the future. The bud which is coming into blossom
somewhere has already blossomed, so it <em>will</em> blossom, it will
become a flower. Right now the bud is in the process of flowering, right
now it is only a bud, but if it is in the process of flowering, then it
will flower. Its having flowered has also in a sense already occurred
somewhere.</p><p>Now we should look at this from another angle. It will be a little
difficult.</p><p>We always look from the viewpoint of the past.</p><p><br></p><p>The bud is blossoming...but our thinking is generally past-oriented,
bound to the past. We say that the bud is blossoming, that it is
becoming a flower, that the bud will become a flower.</p><p>But the reverse may be the case. For instance, if I push you from
behind, I am making you go forward. But it may also be that someone is
pulling you from ahead. The motion can be in both directions. I am
pushing you from behind and you are going forward. It may be that
someone is pulling you from ahead, and that no one is pushing you from
behind. In this case too you will move forward.</p><p><br></p><p>Astrology recognizes the incompleteness of the perspective that the
past gives the impetus and that the future happens as a result. If one
views a phenomenon in its totality, one sees</p><p>that the past is providing the impetus, but that the future is also
exercising a pull, an attraction. The bud becoming a flower is not all
that is happening. The flower is calling out to the bud to become a
flower -- it is exercising a pull. The past is behind, the future is
ahead.</p><p>Now, in the present moment, there is a bud; the entire past is
pushing the bud to become a flower, and the entire future is calling on
the bud to become a flower.</p><p><br></p><p>Under pressure from both the directions, past and future, the bud
will become a flower. If there were no future, the past by itself would
not be able to create the flower because the future must provide the
space for the bud to become a flower. In the future a place, some space,
is necessary. Only if the future provides the space will the bud be able
to flower. If there were no future, then no matter how much the past
tried, no matter how much it pushed you, it would be in vain. No matter
how much I push you from behind, if there is a wall in front of you, I
cannot make you move forward. Space is needed to move forward. If I push
you and the space ahead accepts you with the invitation: "Come, be my
guest," only then can my pushing be significant. For my pushing a space
in the future is needed. The past does the work; the future gives the
space.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the view of astrology that looking from the standpoint of the
past alone is insufficient and only partially scientific.</p><p>The future is calling all the time, drawing us all the time.</p><p><br></p><p>We do not know, we are not aware. This is the weakness of our eyes,
this is our shortsightedness -- we cannot see very far. About tomorrow,
nothing is revealed to us.</p><p><br></p><p>If you looked at Krishnamurti's birth chart, you would be surprised.
If Annie Besant or Leadbeater had cared to look at Krishnamurti's birth
chart, they would have seen that it was wrong to work with Krishnamurti,
because his birth chart clearly shows that whichever organization
Krishnamurti was to belong to, he would be its destroyer. It shows that
whichever organization he was to belong to, he would bring about its
disintegration; whichever organization he was to join, it would die. But
Annie Besant was not ready to accept this. No one could think such a
thing -- but this is the way it happened.</p><p><br></p><p>The theosophical movement tried to groom Krishnamurti as its leader.
Theosophy made such an effort on Krishnamurti's behalf that the movement
died for ever. Annie Besant created a large organization called the Star
of the East, just for Krishnamurti. Then one day, after having inspired
the organization, Krishnamurti separated himself from it. Annie Besant
had dedicated her entire life to putting the organization on its feet,
and had destroyed herself over it. But Krishnamurti cannot be blamed for
this. The star under whose influence he was born clearly announced that
he would be a destructive and disruptive force within any
organization.</p><p><br></p><p>The future is not utterly uncertain. Our knowledge is uncertain; our
ignorance is weighty. Nothing of the future seems to be revealed to us.
We are blind -- nothing at all of the future is revealed to us. And
because nothing seems to be revealed to us, we say it is uncertain. But
something of the future is revealed to us -- astrology is not merely the
study of what the stars and planets say, or of calculating their
significance. This is only one dimension of astrology.</p><p>Then there are other dimensions of knowing the future too. People
have lines on the palms of</p><p>their hands, people have lines on their foreheads, lines on the soles
of their feet -- but this too is superficial.</p><p>In the human body there are hidden <em>chakras</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>Every chakra has its own unique sensation; every chakra vibrates in
its own unique fashion, at its own frequency, all the time. There are
ways to check what these are. Human beings have concealed within them
the mental impressions or seeds of the past.</p><p><br></p><p>Ron Hubbard has brought a new word, a new science, to the West. For
the East it is ancient. The name of this science is "time-track".
Hubbard thinks that in whatever form a man has lived -- whether as man
or beast, whether as plant or stone -- in whatever form he has lived
throughout his infinite span of lives, this entire stream of memories is
still contained within him. This stream can be exposed, and a person can
even be made to re-experience those memories.</p><p><br></p><p>In all of Hubbard's research, this is the most valuable discovery.
Hubbard has said about time- track that within man there are engrams. On
the one hand, we possess a memory by which we recall what happened
yesterday and what happened the day before. This is our "working"
memory, this is our everyday memory. Just as every shopkeeper or office
worker keeps a daily register, this is our working memory. It becomes
useless every day, and then no longer exists -- it is not at all
permanent. This is the working memory through which we do our work every
day, and then every day we throw it out.</p><p><br></p><p>But deeper than this is a memory which is not merely for getting work
done: a memory which is our life, which sums up our entire experience,
the accumulated essence of our experience throughout countless lives on
the path. Hubbard has called this an "engram" -- it has become ingrained
within us. It lies there in its entirety, locked deep within, just as if
a tape is kept locked up in your pocket. It can be opened, and when it
is opened it becomes what Mahavir used to call past-life remembrance.
Hubbard calls it time-track -- it makes it possible for you to go back
in time. When it is opened, the experience is not that you are
remembering; it is not as though you are remembering, you
<em>relive</em> the experience.</p><p><br></p><p>When it is unlocked, when the time-track is unlocked, you do not feel
that "I am remembering." No, you relive it. Try to understand. If your
time-track is unlocked, this reliving will not be difficult. In fact,
without it astrology is incomplete. The deepest realization of astrology
is that your past must be unlocked, because if you become aware of your
entire past then you will be aware of your entire future; your future
will emerge out of your past.</p><p>Without knowing your past you cannot know your future, because your
future will be the child of your past, your future will be born out of
your past.</p><p><br></p><p>So first it is necessary that your entire memory track be exposed to
view. If your memory track is unlocked -- and for this there are
techniques and methods -- you are mistaken if you think that you will
remember how your father slapped you when you were a six-year-old</p><p>child. You will not remember how you were when you were six years old
-- you will relive it.</p><p><br></p><p>You will relive the event. Also, at the time you are reliving it, if
I ask: "What is your name?" you will reply "Junior," not "William Smith
Junior" -- a six-year-old child will be replying. You will be reliving
the event at this time; you will not be remembering it. William Smith
Junior is not remembering when he was six years old. No...William Smith
Junior has <em>becwrre</em> six years old. Now he will answer "Junior;"
whatever reply he gives will be the reply of a six- year-old child.</p><p><br></p><p>If you were brought back to a past life and you remembered that you
were a lion, then if you were disturbed at this point you would begin to
roar just like a lion. You would not speak like a man. It is possible
you would even attack someone with your fingers and nails. If you
remembered that you were a stone and someone asked you a question, then
you would remain completely silent. You would not be able to speak, you
would remain like a stone.</p><p><br></p><p>Hubbard has helped thousands of people. For instance, if a man cannot
speak, Hubbard would say that this person has been blocked by some
childhood memory and cannot move on. He would then take him back along
his time-track and break open his engram at the time when he was six
years old, or the point at which his growth became blocked and he could
not proceed. As he returns to this point, the influence of this
childhood memory will disperse.</p><p>Then this man will again return to being thirty years old and the
twenty-four years' difference will be put aside. The surprising thing is
that thousands of medicines might not help the man to speak, but by
going back along the time-track and then returning, he becomes able
to.</p><p>Many illnesses come to you only because of this time-track.</p><p><br></p><p>Many illnesses fit into this category: for instance, hay fever or
asthma. For the patient who suffers from hay fever, a fixed date exists:
every year on the same date, at the same time, his hay fever returns. So
there can be no remedy for this hay fever. Why?...Because hay fever is
not actually a bodily illness, it is a time-track illness. Somewhere a
memory has been fixed, somewhere a memory has been blocked.</p><p><br></p><p>For instance, a man has a memory related to the twelfth of the month
during the rainy season. When the twelfth comes, when the rainy season
comes, the man is getting ready; he is already afraid of what will
happen. You will be surprised that the hay fever which will now attack
him is just something he is reliving -- it is not really hay fever at
all. He is only reliving what occurred on the twelfth, the previous
year. If you give him any treatment now, you will only be putting him in
more trouble. Medical treatment is of no use because he is not the same
man who existed a year ago, and who at that time could have been
treated. You are unnecessarily throwing the medicine away, because it is
going into the man who exists now, not into the man who was sick a year
ago. There is no connection between the two, no relationship. Every
medicine will fail, every medicine will only increase his hay fever and
so he will say that nothing is working. He is again getting ready to
repeat what happened the previous year.</p><p><br></p><p>Seventy percent of our illnesses happen through the time-track. They
have been caught and grasped so tightly that we relive them again and
again.</p><p>Astrology is not merely the study of the stars, although it includes
that. We will talk about this. Besides the study of the stars, there are
other, separate, dimensions through which astrology tries to probe man's
future, by which it can get hold of the future.</p><p><br></p><p>In order to become aware of the future, it is necessary to become
aware of the past. In order to be aware of the past, it is necessary to
read the inscriptions traced on your body and on your mind. There are
inscriptions on your body and there are inscriptions on your mind. From
the time astrology became obsessed with these bodily inscriptions, it
could no longer go very deep, because these bodily inscriptions are very
superficial.</p><p>If your mind undergoes a change, then the lines on your palm will
immediately change.</p><p><br></p><p>If under hypnosis you are assured that after fifteen days you will
die, and if every day for fifteen days you are made unconscious and
assured in your unconscious state that you will die after fifteen
days...whether you actually die or not, your life-line will be broken at
the proportional length of fifteen days. A gap will have appeared in
your life-line; the body will accept the notion that death is on its
way.</p><p><br></p><p>The lines traced on the body are a very superficial phenomenon. Deep
within is the mind. However, the mind with which you are familiar does
not exist deep down; it is superficial. Deep down there is a mind which
you do not know at all. The centers that exist deep within this body,
which yoga calls chakras, are the accumulated forms of many lives. One
who knows can, by placing his hand on a particular chakra, discover how
active it is. By touching your seven chakras, it can be known whether
you have ever experienced them or not.</p><p><br></p><p>I have experimented with the <em>chakras</em> of hundreds of people
and I have been surprised to find that at the most one or two, and only
rarely three, chakras have begun to be activated; generally, they remain
dormant. You have never used them, but they are your past. If a man who
has experienced them comes to me, and I can see that all his seven
chakras are active, then it can be said that this is his last birth.
Then there will not be another birth, because if all seven chakras are
active, there is no possibility of another life. This life will be
<em>nirvana</em>, this life will be liberation.</p><p><br></p><p>If someone came to Mahavir, he made it his concern to discover how
many chakras were active in the person -- how much work must be done
with him, what his possibilities were, when and whether his labor would
bear any fruit or not, and how many more births he would need.</p><p><br></p><p>Astrology is an attempt to probe the future by many, many paths.
Among these -- and the most commonly used path -- is the study of how
the planets and stars influence man. For this, more scientific evidence
is becoming available every day. This much has been decided: life is
affected and cannot avoid being affected by these influences. Only the
second part remains difficult to determine: whether each person is also
affected as an individual. It worries scientists a little whether each
person is affected individually, whether the three or four billion
people on this planet are each affected as individuals. But they must
realize that it is so. But why are they so troubled?</p><p>Nature gives each person a thumb which is uniquely his, which is
individual and</p><p>unrepeatable.</p><p><br></p><p>Nature keeps such a subtle account that it gives each person a thumb
which is uniquely his, and a thumbprint which can never belong to anyone
else, neither now nor in the future.</p><p>Several billion people may have lived on the Earth, several billion
people may live on the Earth in the future, but my thumbprint will not
be repeated. You may be surprised to learn that even in the case of
twins born out of one egg their thumb-prints will differ from one
another.</p><p><br></p><p>If nature can bestow so much individuality on each person with regard
to a worthless thing like a thumb -- a thing which is of no special
value and which seems to fulfill no special purpose -- if nature can
even give a thumb a uniqueness, then can't it give each man a unique
life and a unique soul? There seems to be no reason why it should not.
But science moves in slow motion -- and it is good: For science, slow
motion is good. Until a fact has been completely proved, it is not good
to move forward even an inch. But prophets can take a leap. They can
declare what will happen in a thousand or even a hundred thousand years
-- right now.</p><p><br></p><p>Science moves forward inch by inch. It sees only facts, facts that
can be experimented upon. Dreaming is of no use to science, but prophets
can discover truth even in dreams. For them, even the future is simply
the expanded present.</p><p><br></p><p>Astrology is basically an investigation of the future. And science is
basically the investigation of the past. Science is the investigation of
the cause of all that exists today. Astrology is the investigation of
the effect of all that exists today. Between the two there is a huge
gap. But every day science experiences new things, and the theories
which seemed impossible have begun to seem possible.</p><p><br></p><p>As I have said, science has only recently accepted that every person
is born with a built-in individuality. For a long time it has been
reluctant to accept the validity of this idea. But astrology has always
been saying this. Just try to understand.â¦</p><p><br></p><p>For instance, take a seed, a mango seed...when we sow the mango seed,
contained within it there must be some sort of built-in program, there
must be a blueprint. If this were not so, the seed would be helpless. It
neither takes advice from a specialist nor does it study at a university
How then can a mango tree develop out of this seed? Still, it produces
the mango</p><p>tree leaf, it bears the mango fruit. Concealed in the stone-like seed
there must be a complete program. Without such a program what could the
seed do? Everything must be present within it. Whatever the tree will
be, must somehow be concealed within the seed. It is not visible to us.
We can smash it and dissect it, and it will still not be visible. But it
must be there somehow, otherwise a <em>neerr</em> tree might possibly
emerge from the mango seed.</p><p>It seems that there is never a mistake.</p><p><br></p><p>Only a mango tree emerges; everything is repeated correctly. Stored
in this tiny seed is all the information which relates to what the seed
must do -- how it must sprout, what type of leaf and how many branches
to produce, how big a tree to become, for how long it will grow, how
tall it will grow -- all this must be hidden within the seed. How many
mangoes, how</p><p>sweet, whether they will ripen or not -- all this must be concealed
within the seed. If all this is concealed just within a mango seed, then
when you come into your mother's womb will there be nothing latent in
<em>ywur</em> seed?</p><p><br></p><p>Now scientists agree that even at this stage the color of your eyes
must lie concealed, that the color of your hair must lie concealed, that
the height of your body must lie concealed, that the possibilities of
health and ill health must lie concealed, and that even your IQ must lie
concealed -- because without all this how would you develop? And by what
means? You must have a program that is built-in in advance. How will
certain bones join together as a hand, and others as a foot? One part
will begin to see, another part will begin to hear. How can all this
happen?</p><p><br></p><p>Scientists used to say that it is just coincidence. But the word
coincidence seems very unscientific. Coincidence means chance. By chance
a foot might begin to see and a hand to hear. But there does not seem to
be much coincidence; everything seems to be in order, prearranged.</p><p><br></p><p>Astrology says a more scientific thing. It says that every-thing is
available within the seed. Astrology says that if we study the seed, if
we can discover the language of the seed and if we can decode this
language -- if we can ask the seed: "What is your intention?" -- then we
will be able to draw up the complete blueprint of a human being too.
Scientists have already begun to draw up such blueprints for plants. Up
to now we have considered astrology to be superstition, a matter of
blind faith. But if science draws up such blue-prints, it will in fact
become astrology -- and certainly science has already begun to draw up
such blueprints.</p><p><br></p><p>Astrology declares that if by divine grace we can come to know the
whole, then the future as such will not exist. But because we do not
know the whole -- we know only a small fragment</p><p>-- what we do not know becomes the future. We are obliged to say:
"Perhaps it will be like this." Because much is unknown to us. If the
whole were known then we could say: "It will be like this." And it would
be exactly so.</p><p>If everything is latent within the human seed, then it is only a
matter of studying the seed.</p><p><br></p><p>What I am talking about today must in some form have existed in my
seed as a potentiality; otherwise, how could I talk about all this? If
some day it becomes possible to observe a human seed, then after
observing my seed, a blueprint could be drawn up indicating what I will
say in this life, what I will become, what I will not become, what I
will make of myself, what I will not make of myself, and what will
happen. All this could be forecast. It will not be surprising when,
maybe tomorrow if not today, we have the capacity to peep into the human
seed. The first steps have already been taken in this direction.</p><p><br></p><p>Birth charts and horoscopes are only a probing into all these
matters. For thousands of years when a child is born, we have tried to
find out what he will become. If we could get some idea, then perhaps we
could make some arrangements, and perhaps we could increase the child's
opportunities. Then whatever is to happen, we could become accepting of
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Towards the end of his life, Mulla Nasruddin declared that he had
always been miserable, but that suddenly one day he had become happy.
The entire population of the village was struck</p><p>with wonder that a man who had always been depressed, who had always
seen the dark side of things, should suddenly have become cheerful. He
was a man who had always been pessimistic, who had always looked for
thorns.</p><p><br></p><p>Once there was an excellent crop in Nasruddin's garden. There were so
many apples that the trees were overloaded. One man in the neighborhood
inquired whether Nasruddin could now have any complaint. He said: "This
time the crop is such that it will rain gold. What do you think,
Nasruddin?"</p><p><br></p><p>In great sorrow Nasruddin said: "Everything is okay, but where will I
get rotten apples to feed the animals?"</p><p><br></p><p>Such a man always remains miserable: "Where will I get rotten apples
to feed the animals?" All the apples were good, none were rotten -- this
was his difficulty.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly one day this man became happy, and so the people of the
village were curious. They asked: "You are happy, Nasruddin? What is the
secret?"</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin said: "I have learned to cooperate with the inevitable.
After many years of struggling, I have realized something. Now I have
decided that what must be, must be. Now I cooperate with the inevitable,
so now there is no reason to be miserable. Now I am happy."</p><p><br></p><p>Astrology investigates many things. It lends a cooperative hand to
whatever is inevitable. It does not unnecessarily struggle against
whatever is to be. It does not demand or reach out towards whatever is
not to be.</p><p><br></p><p>Astrology was a means for making man religious -- for bringing him to
suchness, for bringing him to an ultimate acceptance.</p><p><br></p><p>It has many dimensions, it has many aspects. We will gradually
discuss each dimension. For today, just this much: that the universe is
a living body, an organic unity. In it nothing is isolated, all is
connected. Whatever is far away is connected to that which is near,
nothing is separate.</p><p><br></p><p>So no one should remain in a fallacy that he is an isolated island,
separate, aloof. Each one is connected to the whole, and each one is all
the time affecting the other and being affected by the other. Even when
you pass by a stone lying on the road, it is throwing its vibrations in
your direction. The flowers too are throwing out their vibrations. And
you are not just passing by, you too are throwing out your
vibrations.</p><p><br></p><p>I said that we are affected by the moon and the stars. Another idea
that astrology has is that the moon and the stars are affected by us,
because influence comes from both directions.</p><p>Whenever a man like Buddha is born on the Earth, the moon may not
realize that it is because of him that storms are not arising on its
surface -- that because of Buddha the storms have subsided. The moon is
affected and the sun is also moved.</p><p>When spots occur on the sun and storms arise, diseases spread across
the Earth. When a</p><p>person like Buddha is born on the Earth, a current of peace flows,
the pillar of consciousness grows strong, and the deep beauty of
meditation moves over the Earth; which also makes it difficult for a
storm to arise on the sun because everything is joined together.</p><p><br></p><p>A tiny blade of grass has an impact on the sun, and the sun has its
impact on the blade of grass. The blade of grass is not so tiny that the
sun can say: "I do not care about you," nor is the sun so big that it
can say: "What can this blade of grass do for me?" Life is
interconnected.</p><p>Here nothing is big or small; everything is one organic unity.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=_index class=s3 target=_blank>Life is a whole. You will
only understand astrology if you can perceive this wholeness, otherwise
you will not. This is the aspect which I have spoken on today.</a>
Tomorrow, we will slowly begin to discuss further dimensions.</p><p>Enough for today?</p><p><a href=_index class=s3 target=_blank>Osho:</a> <a href=_index class=a target=_blank>Hidden</a> <a href=_index class=s3 target=_blank></a>Mysteries,<span class=p>Chapter

The past has been very male chauvinistic, so anything manly was praised very much. The woman was thought to be not really human. In China, one could kill one’s wife and it was not a crime. No court would take any note of it; it was a private affair.\nMan has dominated the past and messed up everything. The future belongs to the feminine qualities, not to the manly qualities. The male quality is basically that of aggression, and the female quality basically is that of receptivity. It is because of man that there have been so many wars. It is because of man that there has been so much destruction. Man has to learn to be a little more feminine.\nThe feminine has to be freed from the past and its domination, man has to learn to become a little more feminine, and we can create a better future than the past, we can create a more peaceful earth, more loving. There is no future for manly qualities; they are finished, man is spent. Woman has to be explored – for new visions, for new perspectives, for new possibilities.\nDeva means divine, nellie means light – divine light. We are born with it. It is already there, in the depths of your being. The darkness is only outside, but because we go on looking on the outside, we remain in darkness. The moment one takes a one-hundred-and-eighty degree turn and just looks within oneself, all is light.\nAnd it is eternal light: it needs no fuel, it simply is there. It is our very being, we are it. It is not that the light is seen by us; there is no seen and no seer. One feels oneself as light, and that is the moment of great delight. Then no darkness can ever make you afraid. Then for you there is no death. Death happens only in darkness: once the inner light is experienced, one has experienced immortality.\n[The new sannyasin asks: How should I use my energy?]\nJust wait a little – feel it more. The first thing is to feel one’s energy. The first thing is not the question ‘How to use it?’. The first thing is: how to feel it and how to feel it intensely, passionately, totally. And the beauty is that once you have felt your energy, out of that very feeling the insight arises: how to use it. The energy starts directing you. It is not that you direct the energy: on the contrary, the energy starts moving on its own accord and you simply follow it. Then there is spontaneity and then there is freedom.\nIf you try to use the energy, two things are going to happen: one, from the very beginning you have taken a standpoint of duality, that you are separate from the energy – which is wrong, which creates a split, which is the base of all schizophrenia. From the very beginning you have started controlling your energy, manipulating your energy; and this can be done only through the head. The head is the head-manipulator, and it is always trying to control everything. And if the head controls the energy it can allow it only so far, only so far; it has a certain limitation. Beyond that it will not allow the energy to move. And what is the limit beyond which the head never allows? The limit is: where energy becomes orgasmic, then the head becomes afraid, because the head starts melting and losing its control. Now it is beyond it; now something is happening which is not controllable. So just one step before it starts happening, the head starts pulling it back.\nThe head is very non-orgasmic; it does not allow any orgasmic experience. It may be sex, it may be love, beauty, music, dance, anything, but it never allows any orgasmic experience. It simply holds back, because to be orgasmic means to be out of your head. The head is blown; and it is very afraid of that, naturally – it is a kind of death, losing control.\nSo if you think about how to use it, from the very beginning the head is taking the position of the controller, the director.\nAnd the second thing: if the head tries to control, the whole of your energy will never become available to you, because the head can function only on the surface; it cannot move to the centre. Thought cannot move to the centre of your being; your centre of being is utterly thoughtless. It is silence, no word has ever penetrated it. It is virgin silence; the mind cannot interfere there.\nSo if the head is in control then you will be using only the superficial energies which are available on the circumference. Then energies are very limited. Then one feels very easily tired, exhausted. One is not connected, not plugged into the real source of energies.\nSo these two problems arise if you ask the question ‘how to use’. My approach is: experience what this energy is. Then two things will happen again. One: you will see that you are it. That brings a deep unity, integration; the split disappears. For the first time you are really normal. And the second thing: you can be orgasmic; now there is nobody to control. You are energy, so you can go with the energy wherever it goes, in deep trust. Then the whole of life becomes orgasmic.\nSexual orgasm is the lowest orgasm, biological. but there are thousands of other, higher orgasms. Listening to music somebody who is really in love with music goes orgasmic. This is a higher phenomenon: something deeper is stirred. Dancing, one goes into orgasm. It has nothing to do with the biological, with the physical; it is something inner. Or when seeing beauty, just the sunset, the sheer joy of seeing the colourful clouds, the mystery of it all... and one stop breathing, the heart misses a beat and there is great joy.\nEnergy has to be felt. This is the work that we are doing here: energy has to be felt in its totality, and then it takes possession of you and then it leads you; and wherever it leads is good. Wherever it leads is god.\nMichael means godlike, karuno means compassion. Sex is animal-like, love is manlike, and compassion is godlike. From sex to compassion is the whole pilgrimage of life. The sexual energy has to be transformed first into love and then into compassion.\nThe sexual state is that of exploiting the other, using the other; the other is reduced to a thing. It is an I-it relationship. Sex only wants to take; it does not know how to give.\nLove moves a little higher. It becomes an I-thou relationship. The other is no more a thing to be used and thrown away. The other is as divine as you are; the other is a person. Love gives dignity to the other, sex takes away all dignity.\nLove knows how to give and how to take. Sex knows only how to take, hence the sexual relationship remains that of conflict. Love is more harmonious; it is a give-take relationship: one gives, one takes. There is more friendship in it than in a sexual relationship, less antagonism, more accord.\nCompassion is the highest form of energy, where I-thou disappear. There is no I, there is no thou – just one pure energy. The lover and the beloved have disappeared, melted, into it. Something higher has taken possession; there is no separation. There is nothing to take and nothing to give, because all is given and all is taken: there is no separation.\nSex remains very small; love expands; compassion becomes as infinite as the sky.\nAnand means bliss, blissful, keith means a wood-dweller, one who lives in a forest – a blissful wood- dweller. I am not talking about the forest that exists without; I am talking of the forest that exists within.\nThere is a place within you which is absolutely silent – no woods are so silent – and which is utterly beautiful; no forests are so green and so full of fragrance. The inner forest is so close that any moment you close your eyes you are there; you need not travel. In fact people feel very good when they go into the woods because somehow it stirs a nostalgia for, a memory of, the experience that you had when you were a child of your inner silence, of your inner innocence, purity, of your inner aliveness. Going to the mountains one remembers that there are mountains within.\nOne who has found the inner mountains and inner forests need not go anywhere: he can simply close his eyes and disappear into the inner world; and the inner is far vaster than the outer.\nAnand means bliss, jurg means a farmer. Gautam the Buddha used to say: I am a farmer. I cultivate bliss, love, compassion, samadhi.\nIn fact every seeker of truth has to become a farmer. It is a kind of inner agriculture. All is ready: the soil is ready, the seed is ready, the climate is ready – it is just that the farmer is fast asleep. The farmer has to be awakened and the work starts. Once the farmer is awake he can see that the soil is ready. The seed is ready. The climate has come; the right moment has arrived. Once the farmer is\nawake, your life starts taking on a new duality. You are no more poor; you start growing inner crops of richness. And once the inner crops have been reaped, one is fulfilled: one has been fruitful.\nThen life is not a complaint. Then great gratitude arises on its own accord; that gratitude is prayer. Others who pray, pray in vain. Their prayer is false and pseudo, their gratitude just a formality. The real gratitude is possible only when you start feeling an inner fulfilment. And sannyas is the beginning, the beginning of waking up the farmer!\nPrem means love; in Greek mythology Doris is the name of the goddess of the sea. Your name will mean: a goddess of the sea of love, a goddess of the ocean of love. Love is oceanic; it knows no boundaries, it is shoreless. Love is also wild, as wild as the ocean. Love has depth, just as the ocean has depth.\nThe person who has not known love has lived really very superficially. He will not understand the dimension of depth at all. He has lived a flat life, two dimensional; and without the third dimension there is no depth. Millions of people are living flat lives, hence they look bored. And once a person starts feeling tired, he starts committing suicide because he loses the zest to live. Deep down in the unconscious he starts feeling ‘It would be better not to be, because now there is no point in being’.\nIt is love that gives you depth, meaning, significance. It is love that destroys all boredom and keeps you ever-fresh, alive, and surprised too, because love brings so many gifts, and unasked for.\nThe ultimate gift of love is god. If one goes on and on, loving and loving and loving, the ultimate gift of love is god himself. Love reaches, ends, culminates, in god.\n[A sannyasin, leaving, asks: I!d like to know if you can help me to understand how I’m missing you and my centre.]\nDrop this idea that you should not be missing, simply drop that idea. When you feel, it is good; when you don’t feel, that too is good. One has to become more accepting of all the ups and downs. There is a rhythm: sometimes you will feel that you are in tune, sometimes you will feel that you are missing; that is natural. It is like day and night, summer and winter. One has to learn the shadow part of everything. If you cannot accept the shadow part you become unnecessarily disturbed, and that disturbance will make things more complicated.\nSo my suggestion is: when something beautiful happens, accept, feel grateful; when it doesn’t happen, accept that too and continue to feel grateful, knowing that this is just a resting period. For the whole day you have worked and in the night you fall asleep: you don’t feel miserable because you will not be able to work and you will not be able to earn and you will not be able to do a thousand and one things and there are so many things to do; you don’t worry about it.\nThere are people who worry. Then they start losing their sleep, and they are not benefited by it. The person who has not been able to sleep in the night feels exhausted in the morning, more tired than he was when he went to bed. The person who forgets the whole day and accepts night as a rest part and goes into deep relaxation by the morning will be able to live again with new eyes and new being, will be able to accept the new day and welcome it, will be glad to breathe the air again and to see the sun and people. Remember always that everything has its rest period; and the rest period is not against it, the rest period gives it energy, vitality.\nSo when you are feeling attuned with me, it is beautiful; when you miss that, don’t become disturbed. That is a rest period: it will make you able to be attuned on a higher plane soon. But if you get disturbed about missing, that will create trouble. Then it may take a longer period for you to be attuned again.\nOnce the natural rhythm is accepted it comes on and off on its own and one enjoys both. Try this! [A sannyasin is leaving and wants to start a meditation centre.]\nGood. Remember that this is your home – finally you have to come forever. Just keep it somewhere in your heart, and the seed will grow and will bring you back!\nAnd are you going to start a center there?... Start a center there.…\nPeople will come – just start. Just start, don’t wait, and you will be surprised how many people were just waiting to come. Your place will grow soon – just start it. That’s what is happening to all the centres. People are in a great need and they are searching.\nAnd I will be there to help you – you are not alone! [A sannyasin arriving says: I don’t feel very blissful.]\nI can see it, that’s why I am saying to just do a few groups, be here and when you are going, then remind me; then things will b e on a different plane. Right now I can see that you are a little low. It is better to talk about you when you are not so low, otherwise you will not be able to understand.\nIt is one of the fundamentals that people can understand things more easily when they are flowing ’! higher. They are more open, vulnerable, receptive, more intelligent, and higher truths can be told to them. When they are very low, in a dark, dismal mood, you can tell them but they will be deaf.\nSo do a few groups – those groups w ill remove the wax from your ears – and then I will say!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2619","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/you_aint_seen_nothin_yet/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/you_aint_seen_nothin_yet/>You Ain\'t Seen Nothin\' Yet</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">7</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2619 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/You_Aint_Seen_Nothin_Yet/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

chauvinistic, so anything manly was praised very much. The woman was
thought to be not really human. In China, one could kill one’s wife and
it was not a crime. No court would take any note of it; it was a private
affair.</p><p><br></p><p>Man has dominated the past and messed up everything. The future

other, sex takes away all dignity.</p><p><br></p><p>Love knows how to give and how to take. Sex knows only how to take,
hence the sexual relationship remains that of conflict. Love is more
harmonious; it is a give-take relationship: one gives, one takes. There
is more friendship in it than in a sexual relationship, less antagonism,
more accord.</p><p><br></p><p>Compassion is the highest form of energy, where I-thou disappear.
There is no I, there is no thou – just one pure energy. The lover and
the beloved have disappeared, melted, into it. Something higher has
taken possession; there is no separation. There is nothing to take and
nothing to give, because all is given and all is taken: there is no
separation.</p><p><br></p><p>Sex remains very small; love expands; compassion becomes as infinite
as the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>Anand means bliss, blissful, keith means a wood-dweller, one who
lives in a forest – a blissful wood- dweller. I am not talking about the
forest that exists without; I am talking of the forest that exists
within.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a place within you which is absolutely silent – no woods are
so silent – and which is utterly beautiful; no forests are so green and
so full of fragrance. The inner forest is so close that any moment you
close your eyes you are there; you need not travel. In fact people feel
very good when they go into the woods because somehow it stirs a
nostalgia for, a memory of, the experience that you had when you were a
child of your inner silence, of your inner innocence, purity, of your
inner aliveness. Going to the mountains one remembers that there are
mountains within.</p><p><br></p><p>One who has found the inner mountains and inner forests need not go
anywhere: he can simply close his eyes and disappear into the inner
world; and the inner is far vaster than the outer.</p><p><br></p><p>Anand means bliss, jurg means a farmer. Gautam the Buddha used to
say: I am a farmer. I cultivate bliss, love, compassion, samadhi.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact every seeker of truth has to become a farmer. It is a kind of
inner agriculture. All is ready: the soil is ready, the seed is ready,
the climate is ready – it is just that the farmer is fast asleep. The
farmer has to be awakened and the work starts. Once the farmer is awake
he can see that the soil is ready. The seed is ready. The climate has
come; the right moment has arrived. Once the farmer is</p><p><br></p><p>awake, your life starts taking on a new duality. You are no more
poor; you start growing inner crops of richness. And once the inner
crops have been reaped, one is fulfilled: one has been fruitful.</p><p><br></p><p>Then life is not a complaint. Then great gratitude arises on its own
accord; that gratitude is prayer. Others who pray, pray in vain. Their
prayer is false and pseudo, their gratitude just a formality. The real
gratitude is possible only when you start feeling an inner fulfilment.
And sannyas is the beginning, the beginning of waking up the farmer!</p><p><br></p><p>Prem means love; in Greek mythology Doris is the name of the goddess
of the sea. Your name will mean: a goddess of the sea of love, a goddess
of the ocean of love. Love is oceanic; it knows no boundaries, it is
shoreless. Love is also wild, as wild as the ocean. Love has depth, just
as the ocean has depth.</p><p><br></p><p>The person who has not known love has lived really very
superficially. He will not understand the dimension of depth at all. He
has lived a flat life, two dimensional; and without the third dimension
there is no depth. Millions of people are living flat lives, hence they
look bored. And once a person starts feeling tired, he starts committing
suicide because he loses the zest to live. Deep down in the unconscious
he starts feeling ‘It would be better not to be, because now there is no
point in being’.</p><p><br></p><p>It is love that gives you depth, meaning, significance. It is love
that destroys all boredom and keeps you ever-fresh, alive, and surprised
too, because love brings so many gifts, and unasked for.</p><p><br></p><p>The ultimate gift of love is god. If one goes on and on, loving and
loving and loving, the ultimate gift of love is god himself. Love
reaches, ends, culminates, in god.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, leaving, asks: I!d like to know if you can help me to
understand how I’m missing you and my centre.]</p><p><br></p><p>Drop this idea that you should not be missing, simply drop that idea.
When you feel, it is good; when you don’t feel, that too is good. One
has to become more accepting of all the ups and downs. There is a
rhythm: sometimes you will feel that you are in tune, sometimes you will
feel that you are missing; that is natural. It is like day and night,
summer and winter. One has to learn the shadow part of everything. If
you cannot accept the shadow part you become unnecessarily disturbed,
and that disturbance will make things more complicated.</p><p><br></p><p>So my suggestion is: when something beautiful happens, accept, feel
grateful; when it doesn’t happen, accept that too and continue to feel
grateful, knowing that this is just a resting period. For the whole day
you have worked and in the night you fall asleep: you don’t feel
miserable because you will not be able to work and you will not be able
to earn and you will not be able to do a thousand and one things and
there are so many things to do; you don’t worry about it.</p><p><br></p><p>There are people who worry. Then they start losing their sleep, and
they are not benefited by it. The person who has not been able to sleep
in the night feels exhausted in the morning, more tired than he was when
he went to bed. The person who forgets the whole day and accepts night
as a rest part and goes into deep relaxation by the morning will be able
to live again with new eyes and new being, will be able to accept the
new day and welcome it, will be glad to breathe the air again and to see
the sun and people. Remember always that everything has its rest period;
and the rest period is not against it, the rest period gives it energy,
vitality.</p><p><br></p><p>So when you are feeling attuned with me, it is beautiful; when you
miss that, don’t become disturbed. That is a rest period: it will make
you able to be attuned on a higher plane soon. But if you get disturbed
about missing, that will create trouble. Then it may take a longer
period for you to be attuned again.</p><p><br></p><p>Once the natural rhythm is accepted it comes on and off on its own
and one enjoys both. Try this! [A sannyasin is leaving and wants to
start a meditation centre.]</p><p>Good. Remember that this is your home – finally you have to come
forever. Just keep it somewhere in your heart, and the seed will grow
and will bring you back!</p><p><br></p><p>And are you going to start a center there?... Start a center
there.…</p><p><br></p><p>People will come – just start. Just start, don’t wait, and you will
be surprised how many people were just waiting to come. Your place will
grow soon – just start it. That’s what is happening to all the centres.
People are in a great need and they are searching.</p><p><br></p><p>And I will be there to help you – you are not alone! [A sannyasin
arriving says: I don’t feel very blissful.]</p><p>I can see it, that’s why I am saying to just do a few groups, be here
and when you are going, then remind me; then things will b e on a
different plane. Right now I can see that you are a little low. It is
better to talk about you when you are not so low, otherwise you will not
be able to understand.</p><p><br></p><p>It is one of the fundamentals that people can understand things more
easily when they are flowing ’! higher. They are more open, vulnerable,
receptive, more intelligent, and higher truths can be told to them. When
they are very low, in a dark, dismal mood, you can tell them but they
will be deaf.</p><p><br></p><p>So do a few groups – those groups w ill remove the wax from your ears
– and then I will say!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Deva means divine, jurgen means a farmer.
Life is an opportunity, just a seed. One can miss it, one can remain a seed; that will be the missing of the opportunity. One has to seek the right soil. One has to be a farmer; One has to learn how to grow.
All that is needed in farming is needed in inner growth too: the right soil, the right season, protection for the new sprouts, the right quantity of water and sun and air, and not too much protection; that is the most important thing, because too much protection will not be helpful, it will be harmful."><meta name=author content="Osho"><link rel=canonical href=https://osho.lol/posts/you_aint_seen_nothin_yet/part4/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.b609c58d5c11bb90b1a54e04005d74ad1ddf22165eb79f5533967e57df9c3b50.css integrity="sha256-tgnFjVwRu5CxpU4EAF10rR3fIhZet59VM5Z+V9+cO1A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://osho.lol/posts/you_aint_seen_nothin_yet/part4/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="4"><meta property="og:description" content="< Previous | Contents | Next >

One can miss it, one can remain a seed; that will be the missing of the opportunity. One has to seek the right soil. One has to be a farmer; One has to learn how to grow.\nAll that is needed in farming is needed in inner growth too: the right soil, the right season, protection for the new sprouts, the right quantity of water and sun and air, and not too much protection; that is the most important thing, because too much protection will not be helpful, it will be harmful. If one is protected too much, one becomes spineless; one never becomes strong enough, one is never on one’s own feet.\nSo just as the plants need protection and yet insecurity too, safety and openness to danger, vulnerability, too, in the same way the inner growth needs both. One has to be exactly in the middle of the polar opposites. The moment you lean too much towards one extreme, growth is stifled. Growth needs the golden mean: neither too much security nor too much insecurity. One has to learn it by ones own efforts, slowly slowly; it is a delicate affair.\nNo farmer can teach his son farming except by taking him to the farm day in, day out, year in, year out, so that he learns the knack of it.\nThomas is the name of a disciple of Jesus. To be a disciple is one of the greatest moments in life; neither birth nor death is so important. It is the moment of disciplehood which is of supreme importance, because the real birth happens when one becomes a disciple, and the real death too. In a way one dies, in a way one is reborn. Disciplehood is a paradox, birth. death together. simultaneously; and if one allows this, god is not far away.\nNarayana is a name of god. If one is a disciple, god is not far away. That is the meaning of your name: be a disciple and god is very close by, just by the comer. Be a disciple totally and you have arrived.\nPrem means love, uri means light of god. Love is the light of god. God comes in no other way, in no other form. God showers as love, reaches to the deepest recesses of your being as rays of love. Once it is felt that the whole existence is full of love, god is experienced. The experience that the existence is made of the stuff called love is the experience of god. God is not a person: it is like beauty, an experience.\nLove is the greatest experience possible – the highest and the deepest both. One touches the peaks of the Himalayas and one also reaches to the depths of the Pacific, and simultaneously. Love gives you that expansion. The moment you are in love you are huge, enormous. The lover starts feeling that the body cannot contain him; the body feels to be too small, a confinement. And as love grows, even the whole sky cannot contain it.\nWhen all is felt as love one has known what god is. God is not in the temples, not in the churches, not in the synagogues; god is in the experience of love, god is the experience of love, god is love. Forget god, remember love.\nDeva means divine, and the sound of eenee is beautiful, so I will keep it. The meaning doesn’t matter; what matters is the music, the melody of a word, the music of a word, the rhythm. All meaning is arbitrary. We have given a certain meaning to a certain word, hence it has that meaning. It is not anything natural; it is arbitrary, invented. But sound is natural; it is not given by us.\nMm? – these insects and their sound.If you listen and if you want to find ‘eenee’ in this sound it\nwill be found. Sound is a natural phenomenon.\nThink more of nature and less of the arbitrary, the artificial, because the natural is the door to the divine. Language is not the door to the divine, but music. If one can start hearing the music of existence which is all over – it is just that we are deaf – then god is heard. Or these soundsand\ngod is trying to approach you. Bu our senses have become dull, and we have started living n the man-created world too much.\nOnly the man-created world has meaning. Remove men, the world will be there in its utter beauty, but there will be no meaning to it. The sun will rise and the birds will sing; the trees will grow, the roses will bloom; the spring will come. Everything will continue but with new meaning, with no purpose, with no goal – utterly beautiful but utterly nude of meaning; that’s what existence is.\nTo fall into this meaningless, purposeless existence is meditation; to drown oneself in this beautiful existence for no other reason, for no goal, is to become divine.\n‘God’ also is a meaningless word, the most meaningless of all words, but tremendously significant: the significance consists in its meaninglessness.\nDeva means divine, paul means very little, very small, just like a dew-drop. But the small only appears small. The dew-drop contains all the oceans there are, it has the secret of all the oceans\nin it. It is only quantitatively small, qualitatively not. In the ordinary mathematics the part is smaller than the whole, obviously, but in the higher mathematics the part is not smaller than the whole; it is equal to the whole, because the part is the whole.\nQuantitatively the dew-drop is very small; qualitatively it has the same quality as all oceans have. Man is also very small. Qualitatively it is not so, only quantitatively. Quantitatively man is divine, man is god.\nJesus refers to himself in two ways. Sometimes he says ‘son of man’ and sometimes he says ‘son of god’. It is very significant. When he says ‘son of man’ he refers to his smallness, to his being just a dew-drop; he refers to the quantitative. When he says ‘son of god’ he refers to the qualitative; he refers to his infinity, his eternity.\nKnow yourself as the smallest of the small, and yet remember that you are the eternal, the infinite. Remembering your smallness will help you to become egoless, and remembering your greatness will help you to come closer and closer to truth, to god, to reality.\nDeva means divine. Think of yourself as divine and think of everybody else also as divine. It is not a fiction, it is the reality. Except for god, all are fictions, except for god, everything else is a dream of the mind; only god is. Hence, if we follow the mind, we are never contented, because dreams cannot nourish. They are beautiful when you are far away; when you come closer, disappointment and nothing else is in your hands.\nDreams are like rainbows in the sky: from far away so beautiful, but if you come close and you want to hold the rainbow in your hand, you will find nothing but the vapour. That happens to everybody every day: the dreams, sooner or later, are found to be nothing but vapour.\nOnce this is understood, that all that mind creates, desires, dreams, is a kind of mirage, then the turning point comes, the converting point comes. Then one starts thinking how to transcend the mind, how to have a state where no thought is, no dream is, no desire is? We have lived through dreams and desires and found nothing; now let us try the other way round.\nThat’s what meditation is: looking into reality without anything between you and reality. Just a pure look... and suddenly, all is revealed. That revelation makes you aware that everything, every particle of dust, is divine. Then to live in the same world is a totally different experience. Then you are at home, at ease; then there is no death, there cannot be any death. Then there are no limitations of time and space. Then you have simply gone beyond all limitations. You have freedom, and freedom is joy!\n[The new sannyasin says she has never done groups and does not want to.]\nThen something has to be experimented with. It is always good to try something new. Who knows? – something may happen out of it. Try at least two groups, and if you feel that they are not for you, you can drop out; but try! Mm?\nI will give you two groups – try! The first group you try is Centering – it starts tomorrow – and the second is Intensive Enlightenment. Try two; if you feel that you would like to go deeper, enquire; I will give you a few more. They can be of immense help.\nAnd never close your doors before you have experimented with anything – never, never. Otherwise many things remain unlived, unknown. They were available, and you would have gone through something beautiful; you would have been enriched by them. Always say yes to the new. No has to be used for the old. That which you have seen many times, say no to it. It is pointless, you have seen it; now there is no more in it. But never say no to the new. Even if the effort seems to be meaningless later on – later on it may be felt that it would have been better if you had not gone into it – then too I say, say yes to the new. Even doing something right, efficiently, if it is old, it is meaningless. Doing something which may be a mistake, erroneous, if it is new, it is worth doing, because one grows with the new. It is not a question of right and wrong; the question is between the old and the new. For me the old is sin and the new is virtue.\nDeva means god, david means beloved one – god’s beloved one. Always remind yourself of that. that god loves you. You may have forgotten him, he has not forgotten you; he cannot. You may have gone far away from him but he is always close by. Any moment if you turn towards him he is available. It is like: a man can go running far and far away from the sun, -keeping his back to the sun, but any moment that he turns back. the sun is there as much as before. Those many many miles that he has been running make no sense, no difference.\nGod is always there; we can keep our backs to him or we can confront him. Sannyas is a confrontation with god, it is an encounter, and it needs courage to encounter god. But if you go on feeling and remembering that god loves you, that courage arises; then there is no fear. If god loves you, then there is no problem. Even if you are not worthy it doesn’t matter – god loves you, his compassion is greater than your worthlessness. Your sins cannot be greater than his compassion.\nThis is the attitude of the religious mind: I may have gone astray, I may have made many mistakes. but his quality is to forgive. And in his vision, my sins and my errors and my mistakes can’t be very important. He may not ever be able to see such minute details. they may not be of any relevance in his vision. Man can confront god only if this remembering slowly slowly sinks deep into the heart that ‘God loves me’.\nNames like David were given in the old days as part of meditation. All over the world almost all the old names are somehow related with god, for a certain reason: those names were given to remind yoU again and again that you are David – that god loves you, that you are a beloved one. Don’t feel unworthy and don’t feel worthless. His love gives you worth, significance. splendour.\nThat very understanding is nourishing. It helps you to stand erect. It helps you to be strong enough to go into the unknown; it helps you to seek and search and enquire. It helps you to become a pilgrim of the ultimate.\nZahira is one of the Sufi names for god. Sufis have a hundred names for god; ninety-nine are pronounced, the hundredth is kept unpronounced. Zahira is one of those ninety-nine names; its literal meaning is the manifest one.\nGod has two aspects: one, the manifest – that is the universe: the sun, the moon, the stars, the people, the trees, the birds, the animals. This multi-dimensional universe, that is his manifest form, that is zahira. Hidden behind it is the unmanifest form. Those who remain with the manifest and think that this is all are the worldly people. Those who think that the manifest one is only a finger pointing to the moon and who start searching for the unmanifest one, they are the religious people.\nThis whole existence points towards god; eyes are just needed to see that all arrows are pointing towards god. Each experience of life goes on pushing you towards god. It is really unbelievable how people can go on missing god, because each day a thousand and one opportunities are given, and each day we go on missing. Each day he knocks on our doors and so many many times; and we don’t hear.\nThink of the whole existence as fingers pointing to the unmanifest. Then the beautiful rose suddenly becomes a manifestation of god. The man you love or the woman you love suddenly becomes a manifestation of god. If we can constantly live with this awareness – that all is god – life becomes a benediction.\nThis will be the name for your centre: Joshua. Joshua is the original name of Jesus; in Aramaic it is Joshua. The literal meaning is Jehovah saves, Jehovah is salvation. Only god saves – not our efforts, but his grace. Our efforts do something, certainly – they make us capable to receive his grace, that’s all – but what really saves is his grace.\nOur efforts do a negative part: they remove the hindrances so that his grace can reach to us, but our efforts don’t create it.\nSo this thing has to be constantly remembered: our efforts are needed, yet their function is only negative. They are needed, yet they are not the sole cause of the ultimate happening. They help in removing the hindrances, but the grace was always coming – it was just that the hindrances were there. Now there are no hindrances, the grace reaches you and saves you.\n[A sannyasin, leaving, says: I feel my distrust is still stronger in my than my trust in people... a certain point comes where it is very much hurting to go into a relationship.]\nNext time something much more will have to be done. Distrust is there in everybody, more or less; you may be having a little more, that’s all. But it can be dropped; in fact one cannot carry it very long. It is such an unnecessary burden, it is so destructive. It does not give you any joy, it does not give you anything at all. In fact it destroys so many beautiful things in your being: it destroys your love, it destroys your friendship; it destroys every possibility in which you can grow. So how long can you carry it and for what?\nAnd if you really know how to distrust, then the first thing to be distrusted is distrust itself! Why do you trust your distrust? For what? What is it going to give you? It is your life: you have to be alert about what you are doing to your life. If your distrust is paying you well, continue; there is no problem in it, don’t create a problem out of it. Distrust, distrust more intensely, more totally. But if it is not giving you anything and simply destroying all that is beautiful in your life, then this is the first thing to distrust.\nI think a little more learning about how much it is destroying you will help. So be a little alert. just watch what it is doing to you and to your life. And the next time you come the first thing to remind me about is your distrust, so we will start working on it. Good!\nPrem means love, raj means the secret. Love is the secret, the secret of all secrets, the golden key, the master key, that opens all the locks of all the mysteries. Love, and love for no other reason but\njust for the sheer joy of it. Don’t try to find out reasons to love, because then love becomes shallow. When love is for no reason at all it has tremendous depth. Love unconditionally. The moment you make a condition love becomes a bargain, mundane; without any condition, it is sacred.\nLove to give, not to get. Much comes; but that is another matter. Your whole approach should be that of giving; and the more you give, the more you have to give; the more you pour yourself, the more you are overwhelmed from some unknown sources. Once that is known you have come to know the secret of love.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2946","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/you_aint_seen_nothin_yet/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/you_aint_seen_nothin_yet/>You Ain\'t Seen Nothin\' Yet</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">4</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2946 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/You_Aint_Seen_Nothin_Yet/part4.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

heard. Or these sounds<span class=s4></span>and</p><p>god is trying to approach you. Bu our senses have become dull, and we
have started living n the man-created world too much.</p><p><br></p><p>Only the man-created world has meaning. Remove men, the world will be
there in its utter beauty, but there will be no meaning to it. The sun
will rise and the birds will sing; the trees will grow, the roses will
bloom; the spring will come. Everything will continue but with new
meaning, with no purpose, with no goal – utterly beautiful but utterly
nude of meaning; that’s what existence is.</p><p><br></p><p>To fall into this meaningless, purposeless existence is meditation;
to drown oneself in this beautiful existence for no other reason, for no
goal, is to become divine.</p><p><br></p><p>‘God’ also is a meaningless word, the most meaningless of all words,
but tremendously significant: the significance consists in its
meaninglessness.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine, paul means very little, very small, just like a
dew-drop. But the small only appears small. The dew-drop contains all
the oceans there are, it has the secret of all the oceans</p><p><br></p><p>in it. It is only quantitatively small, qualitatively not. In the
ordinary mathematics the part is smaller than the whole, obviously, but
in the higher mathematics the part is not smaller than the whole; it is
equal to the whole, because the part is the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>Quantitatively the dew-drop is very small; qualitatively it has the
same quality as all oceans have. Man is also very small. Qualitatively
it is not so, only quantitatively. Quantitatively man is divine, man is
god.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus refers to himself in two ways. Sometimes he says ‘son of man’
and sometimes he says ‘son of god’. It is very significant. When he says
‘son of man’ he refers to his smallness, to his being just a dew-drop;
he refers to the quantitative. When he says ‘son of god’ he refers to
the qualitative; he refers to his infinity, his eternity.</p><p><br></p><p>Know yourself as the smallest of the small, and yet remember that you
are the eternal, the infinite. Remembering your smallness will help you
to become egoless, and remembering your greatness will help you to come
closer and closer to truth, to god, to reality.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine. Think of yourself as divine and think of everybody
else also as divine. It is not a fiction, it is the reality. Except for
god, all are fictions, except for god, everything else is a dream of the
mind; only god is. Hence, if we follow the mind, we are never contented,
because dreams cannot nourish. They are beautiful when you are far away;
when you come closer, disappointment and nothing else is in your
hands.</p><p><br></p><p>Dreams are like rainbows in the sky: from far away so beautiful, but
if you come close and you want to hold the rainbow in your hand, you
will find nothing but the vapour. That happens to everybody every day:
the dreams, sooner or later, are found to be nothing but vapour.</p><p><br></p><p>Once this is understood, that all that mind creates, desires, dreams,
is a kind of mirage, then the turning point comes, the converting point
comes. Then one starts thinking how to transcend the mind, how to have a
state where no thought is, no dream is, no desire is? We have lived
through dreams and desires and found nothing; now let us try the other
way round.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what meditation is: looking into reality without anything
between you and reality. Just a pure look... and suddenly, all is
revealed. That revelation makes you aware that everything, every
particle of dust, is divine. Then to live in the same world is a totally
different experience. Then you are at home, at ease; then there is no
death, there cannot be any death. Then there are no limitations of time
and space. Then you have simply gone beyond all limitations. You have
freedom, and freedom is joy!</p><p><br></p><p>[The new sannyasin says she has never done groups and does not want
to.]</p><p><br></p><p>Then something has to be experimented with. It is always good to try
something new. Who knows? – something may happen out of it. Try at least
two groups, and if you feel that they are not for you, you can drop out;
but try! Mm?</p><p><br></p><p>I will give you two groups – try! The first group you try is
Centering – it starts tomorrow – and the second is Intensive
Enlightenment. Try two; if you feel that you would like to go deeper,
enquire; I will give you a few more. They can be of immense help.</p><p><br></p><p>And never close your doors before you have experimented with anything
– never, never. Otherwise many things remain unlived, unknown. They were
available, and you would have gone through something beautiful; you
would have been enriched by them. Always say yes to the new. No has to
be used for the old. That which you have seen many times, say no to it.
It is pointless, you have seen it; now there is no more in it. But never
say no to the new. Even if the effort seems to be meaningless later on –
later on it may be felt that it would have been better if you had not
gone into it – then too I say, say yes to the new. Even doing something
right, efficiently, if it is old, it is meaningless. Doing something
which may be a mistake, erroneous, if it is new, it is worth doing,
because one grows with the new. It is not a question of right and wrong;
the question is between the old and the new. For me the old is sin and
the new is virtue.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means god, david means beloved one – god’s beloved one. Always
remind yourself of that. that god loves you. You may have forgotten him,
he has not forgotten you; he cannot. You may have gone far away from him
but he is always close by. Any moment if you turn towards him he is
available. It is like: a man can go running far and far away from the
sun, -keeping his back to the sun, but any moment that he turns back.
the sun is there as much as before. Those many many miles that he has
been running make no sense, no difference.</p><p><br></p><p>God is always there; we can keep our backs to him or we can confront
him. Sannyas is a confrontation with god, it is an encounter, and it
needs courage to encounter god. But if you go on feeling and remembering
that god loves you, that courage arises; then there is no fear. If god
loves you, then there is no problem. Even if you are not worthy it
doesn’t matter – god loves you, his compassion is greater than your
worthlessness. Your sins cannot be greater than his compassion.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the attitude of the religious mind: I may have gone astray, I
may have made many mistakes. but his quality is to forgive. And in his
vision, my sins and my errors and my mistakes can’t be very important.
He may not ever be able to see such minute details. they may not be of
any relevance in his vision. Man can confront god only if this
remembering slowly slowly sinks deep into the heart that ‘God loves
me’.</p><p><br></p><p>Names like David were given in the old days as part of meditation.
All over the world almost all the old names are somehow related with
god, for a certain reason: those names were given to remind yoU again
and again that you are David – that god loves you, that you are a
beloved one. Don’t feel unworthy and don’t feel worthless. His love
gives you worth, significance. splendour.</p><p><br></p><p>That very understanding is nourishing. It helps you to stand erect.
It helps you to be strong enough to go into the unknown; it helps you to
seek and search and enquire. It helps you to become a pilgrim of the
ultimate.</p><p><br></p><p>Zahira is one of the Sufi names for god. Sufis have a hundred names
for god; ninety-nine are pronounced, the hundredth is kept unpronounced.
Zahira is one of those ninety-nine names; its literal meaning is the
manifest one.</p><p><br></p><p>God has two aspects: one, the manifest – that is the universe: the
sun, the moon, the stars, the people, the trees, the birds, the animals.
This multi-dimensional universe, that is his manifest form, that is
zahira. Hidden behind it is the unmanifest form. Those who remain with
the manifest and think that this is all are the worldly people. Those
who think that the manifest one is only a finger pointing to the moon
and who start searching for the unmanifest one, they are the religious
people.</p><p><br></p><p>This whole existence points towards god; eyes are just needed to see
that all arrows are pointing towards god. Each experience of life goes
on pushing you towards god. It is really unbelievable how people can go
on missing god, because each day a thousand and one opportunities are
given, and each day we go on missing. Each day he knocks on our doors
and so many many times; and we don’t hear.</p><p><br></p><p>Think of the whole existence as fingers pointing to the unmanifest.
Then the beautiful rose suddenly becomes a manifestation of god. The man
you love or the woman you love suddenly becomes a manifestation of god.
If we can constantly live with this awareness – that all is god – life
becomes a benediction.</p><p><br></p><p>This will be the name for your centre: Joshua. Joshua is the original
name of Jesus; in Aramaic it is Joshua. The literal meaning is Jehovah
saves, Jehovah is salvation. Only god saves – not our efforts, but his
grace. Our efforts do something, certainly – they make us capable to
receive his grace, that’s all – but what really saves is his grace.</p><p><br></p><p>Our efforts do a negative part: they remove the hindrances so that
his grace can reach to us, but our efforts don’t create it.</p><p><br></p><p>So this thing has to be constantly remembered: our efforts are
needed, yet their function is only negative. They are needed, yet they
are not the sole cause of the ultimate happening. They help in removing
the hindrances, but the grace was always coming – it was just that the
hindrances were there. Now there are no hindrances, the grace reaches
you and saves you.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, leaving, says: I feel my distrust is still stronger in
my than my trust in people... a certain point comes where it is very
much hurting to go into a relationship.]</p><p><br></p><p>Next time something much more will have to be done. Distrust is there
in everybody, more or less; you may be having a little more, that’s all.
But it can be dropped; in fact one cannot carry it very long. It is such
an unnecessary burden, it is so destructive. It does not give you any
joy, it does not give you anything at all. In fact it destroys so many
beautiful things in your being: it destroys your love, it destroys your
friendship; it destroys every possibility in which you can grow. So how
long can you carry it and for what?</p><p><br></p><p>And if you really know how to distrust, then the first thing to be
distrusted is distrust itself! Why do you trust your distrust? For what?
What is it going to give you? It is your life: you have to be alert
about what you are doing to your life. If your distrust is paying you
well, continue; there is no problem in it, don’t create a problem out of
it. Distrust, distrust more intensely, more totally. But if it is not
giving you anything and simply destroying all that is beautiful in your
life, then this is the first thing to distrust.</p><p><br></p><p>I think a little more learning about how much it is destroying you
will help. So be a little alert. just watch what it is doing to you and
to your life. And the next time you come the first thing to remind me
about is your distrust, so we will start working on it. Good!</p><p><br></p><p>Prem means love, raj means the secret. Love is the secret, the secret
of all secrets, the golden key, the master key, that opens all the locks
of all the mysteries. Love, and love for no other reason but</p><p><br></p><p>just for the sheer joy of it. Don’t try to find out reasons to love,
because then love becomes shallow. When love is for no reason at all it
has tremendous depth. Love unconditionally. The moment you make a
condition love becomes a bargain, mundane; without any condition, it is
sacred.</p><p><br></p><p>Love to give, not to get. Much comes; but that is another matter.
Your whole approach should be that of giving; and the more you give, the
more you have to give; the more you pour yourself, the more you are
overwhelmed from some unknown sources. Once that is known you have come
to know the secret of love.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Work is worship.\n[The father of the children says he is a bit upset because his wife was unable to enter the darshan due to a fragrance.]\nThese are just excuses. Even if that was not the case, the mind would find something else so it is not here. The mind does not allow anybody to be here, the mind always exists somewhere else. It finds excuses, and it is very clever in finding excuses; any excuse will do. And when you have the excuse then you think ‘What can be done? The problem is there; that’s why I am not here.’ No, it is not so.\nYou are not here because you are not yet aware of the cunning strategies of the mind. Everything else is irrelevant. Everybody else’s wives are not in the same situation but they also are not here. Even if sometimes it happens that the mind cannot find any excuse, then too a person is not here. Then a great restlessness arises; the mind starts feeling suffocated. The moment you want to be now and here, the mind starts dying; that is the death of the mind.\nSo don’t allow the mind to give you excuses. And just your not being here is not going to help anybody. What can you do? – you are here, so why not be here totally? Even if you are not mentally here, you are here. It is better to be together; the mind and body should function together. In that\nfunctioning is great melody, in that functioning is great music: in fact that functioning is another name of joy. When your mind and body function in such harmony they hum together; that humming brings you closer and closer to god. My whole emphasis is: wherever you are, be there totally.\nSo don’t listen to the excuses of the mind!\nPrem means love, jolande is the flower, violet. In ancient mythology it represents modesty, humbleness. Love is always humble, love is always modest. The flower, violet, has the tendency to hide – behind bushes, trees. It is very non-exhibitionistic, very shy about declaring itself. And that is the intrinsic quality of love: it is very shy. It is constantly aware that nothing should be done which can be offensive in any way.\nLove, rather than taking the initiative, would like to wait – with hope, patience, expectancy; and that is something immensely spiritual about love. The moment it becomes aggressive, the moment it starts encroaching upon the other, it starts falling from the heights, it starts becoming gross.\nMan’s love is a little gross; woman’s love is far superior, far more delicate. Man’s love has something of activity in it; the woman’s love is inactive. The woman’s love is passive, receptive.\nSo become a receptivity, a humble receptivity, a loving expectancy for god. God knocks only on the doors of those who are modest, humble. Where the ego exists there is a wall between you and god; when the ego is not there there is no wall, there is a bridge. Humbleness becomes the bridge.\nPrem means love, maddalena means elevated. There is nothing higher than love; it is the most elevated experience of life. God is nothing but the ultimate peak of love, the experience of total orgasm – not the sexual, but the inner and the spiritual. The sexual orgasm also gives a glimpse of the inner, it triggers the process of the inner. Any moment of deep love is the moment of god. Whenever you are deep in love with something. in that moment you are in prayer.\nThe name comes from Mary Magdalene. She loved Jesus as nobody else loved him. Her love must have been of tremendous importance in Jesus’ life; it must have kept him tethered to the earth. Otherwise these type of people find it very difficult to even remain in the body. There was no other disciple around Jesus who had such depth, intensity, and totality of love as Magdalene.\nBecause Magdalene is elevated through her love for Jesus, the very word has become... has taken the meaning of elevated. The word itself did not have that meaning in the beginning. It was the name of the town from where Magdalene came, the name of the town was Magda. Magdalene simply means: the woman from Magda. But her love was such that the very name, the very word, has taken on the meaning; a new meaning entered into the world. Now it means the elevated, the magnificent, the splendorous; and those are all the qualities of love.\nPrem means love, nicola means victory. Love is victory, Love is success, Love is fulfilment. A life without love is an utter failure. No other victory can become a substitute for it. One can be the president of the country and it is futile if there is not love in the heart. One can have all the riches in the world, but if love is not in the heart one is poor, a beggar.\nThe only treasure worth searching for is love, because hidden at the very core of love is god. Search for love and you will find god. Nobody finds god by searching for god himself; because there is no\npossibility of directly enquiring into god. The mystery is very elusive: you have to approach it very indirectly, you cannot enter like an arrow. The path is very zig-zag, it moves like a footpath in the hills; and the name of the hills is love!\nThe footpath is not already there; everybody has to make it just by walking. It is not ready-made, it is not like a road. You walk and you create it; you create it and you walk. And the moment you have walked, it goes on disappearing behind you; nobody else can follow you.\nBuddha is reported to have said that the way to truth is like the birds flying in the sky: they don’t leave footprints behind, so there is no possibility of following. Search, yes; follow, no.\nThe master is not to be followed; the master has to be understood so that you can create your own path towards god.\nAnand means bliss, andrea means brave. Bliss is only for those who are brave. It needs guts to be blissful. Any coward can have as much misery as he wants, to his heart’s content. It needs no courage to be miserable, it needs no intelligence to be miserable; in fact it needs nothing to be miserable. But to be blissful, great intelligence is needed. Courage is needed, bravery is needed, because to be blissful means to learn the ways of the unknown; to be blissful means to move into the uncharted. Bliss is always in the movement from the known to the unknown; just in the gap between the known and the unknown is the moment of bliss. When the unknown becomes known, bliss disappears again, it moves into the unknown again. Just between the two, the known and the unknown, in that delicate moment, bliss arises. Once the unknown becomes known, again bliss disappears, remember.\nSo one has to be constantly moving, riverlike; one should never become stagnant, otherwise misery settles. Misery is a pool; bliss is a river. Misery is very very comfortable, convenient, safe, secure; bliss is a totally different affair. To move from the known to the unknown is always risky because you don’t know what is going to happen; it is unpredictable. You are going into something of which you know nothing. You may be a loser; it is a gamble, hence bliss is only for the brave ones. But bliss is life, otherwise one is dead.\nThere are millions of people who are dead and walking on the streets and working in the offices and in the factories; the whole world is full of dead people. There are two kinds of dead people – a few live in the cities and a few live in the cemeteries – but of the really alive there are very few.\nI would like my sannyasins to be really alive, whatsoever the risk. I teach you to be gamblers, to be non-calculators, to be illogically in love with the unknown, to keep the flame burning, to never settle. not even to the last moment of life. Then your whole life will be a blissful song. It will have the quality of poetry and the fragrance of flowers and the light of stars.\n[A sannyasin, leaving, says: I can’t find the words. Words are difficult to find! When you really have something to say then words are difficult. When you have nothing to say you have so many words available! The meaningful can never be said.]\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1533","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/you_aint_seen_nothin_yet/part8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/you_aint_seen_nothin_yet/>You Ain\'t Seen Nothin\' Yet</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">8</h1><div class=post-meta>8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1533 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/You_Aint_Seen_Nothin_Yet/part8.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

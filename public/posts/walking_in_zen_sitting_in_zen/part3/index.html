And Something More\n7 March 1980 am in Buddha Hall\nThe first question Question 1\nOSHO, YOU SAY: GO BEYOND THE MIND. DO NOT LISTEN TO ITS CHATTER. DISCIPLINE IT AND MAKE IT A SERVANT. DO NOT BE ITS SLAVE. BUT HOW TO KNOW WHEN THE MIND IS BEING DISCIPLINED AND WHEN IT IS BEING REPRESSED? ALSO, WHEN I TOOK SANNYAS THE OTHER NIGHT YOU SAID NOT TO GET HOOKED ON YOU. I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE CLOSING THE STABLE DOOR AFTER THIS PARTICULAR HORSE HAS ALREADY BOLTED.\nPrem Lisa,\nTHE DIFFERENCE IS SO GREAT that it is impossible to miss it. Repression happens through fighting with your mind. Discipline happens through being watchful, aware, alert. In discipline, there is no fight implied. In discipline, there is no condemnation, no evaluation. One simply looks at the mind silently, seeing the whole traffic, without saying what is right and what is wrong, what should be and what should not be, just as, standing by the side of the road, you watch the people walking by – saints and sinners, beautiful people, ugly people, good people, bad people – but you are unconcerned. It has nothing to do with you; you are out of it.\nThat’s exactly the meaning of the English word “ecstasy”. Ecstasy means to be out of the mind. You are just looking, as one looks at the clouds moving in the sky or at the river flowing by – cool,\ndetached. Neither are you trying to cling to something nor are you trying to push something away from you.\nThis is pure awareness: you are only a mirror. And in just being a mirror, the miracle happens – the miracle of discipline. Slowly slowly, the traffic starts disappearing. Less and less thoughts are moving on the road, less and less pictures are appearing on the screen, less and less memories, fantasies. Gaps start appearing.\nA mother was telling her child, “Be very careful when you go to school because the traffic is dangerous at rush hour time.”\nThe child said, “Don’t be worried. I always wait by the side of the road. When a gap comes by, then I cross the road.”\n“When a gap comes by...” As you are looking at your mind you will be surprised: gaps come by, intervals when there is nothing to be seen. The observer remains alone and because it is alone it is no longer an observer either. You can’t call it an observer because there is nothing to observe. The mirror is there, but it is not reflecting anything. There is no duality of the seen and the seer. In these intervals discipline arises.\nThe word “discipline” is also beautiful. It is sometimes very significant to go to the roots of words. “Discipline” comes from a root which means learning. When you are looking at a gap, learning happens. Learning about what? Learning about yourself, because there is nothing else. You are full of awareness. You are just full of your own being, overflowing. And this experience of just being yourself, overflowing, undistracted by anything, undisturbed by anything, is the greatest learning, the greatest possibility of knowing the truth. This is discipline.\nFrom the same root comes the word “disciple.” “Disciple” means one who is becoming capable of being utterly silent in the presence of the Master. The disciple is one who allows the interval to happen when he is with the Master. With the Master you are bridged only through silence; when there is nothing in your mind you are bridged. Something then transpires between the Master and the disciple. A flame jumps from the Master into the heart of the disciple. The unlit candle of the disciple suddenly becomes lit. All is joy and light and love, and a great dance arises.\nLisa, discipline can never be misunderstood as repression. Repressions are totally different. In repression you have already decided what is wrong – a priori decisions. In fact, others have decided for you what is wrong and what is right. Now you are simply trying to impose the ideas and opinions of others upon yourself. You will have to repress your nature. You will have to force that which is wrong – or which you have been told is wrong – deep into the unconscious. There will be a fight, great turmoil. Instead of bringing silence to you, every method of repression brings more turmoil.\nThat’s why the so-called religious people are more restless, more worried. You are worried only about this world, they are worried even about the other. You are worried only about this life, they are worried about many many past lives and future lives. Your worries are nothing compared to the worries of the so-called religious people. And they are sitting on a volcano, because whatsoever is repressed is there; it is not destroyed. Repression never destroys anything; you are simply sitting on top of it. And the danger is that you cannot sit on top of it for twenty-four hours a day; you have\nlimitations. You will get tired, you will need some rest. And whenever you will be tired and you will need rest, repressions will start arising in you.\nHence, even your greatest saints go on thinking, fantasizing, dreaming about all those things that they have repressed.\nMahatma Gandhi has written in his autobiography: “I have been able to control my sexuality as far as my day is concerned, but in the night, in my dreams, it comes with a vengeance.” This he was writing at the age of seventy... a whole life of repression!\nYes, in the day you can somehow manage, but in the night, in the dreams, that which you have repressed in the day is bound to take revenge. It will come back, it will explode in you.\nHence, down the ages your saints have been very much afraid of sleep. They go on cutting down on their sleep – five hours, four hours, three hours, two hours. And the less they sleep the greater the danger, because all their repressions have to come in those two hours in a very condensed way. Then they are crowding in from everywhere. And people worship them! The less a saint sleeps, the more people worship him. They say, “Look how much he has sacrificed! What a great austerity he is doing – he is not even sleeping! Or he sleeps for only two hours or one hour.”\nThe reality is that he is afraid of sleep. And from where is the fear coming? The fear is coming from the fact that when you are awake you can control, but when you are asleep, who is there to control? The controller is asleep, is in a relaxed state. He cannot sit on top of all the repressions, and they will assert themselves.\nSo, Lisa, if you are fighting with anything, then it is not discipline. I don’t teach fight, I teach awareness. It is useless to fight with the darkness, utterly useless and stupid. Bring the light in. Why fight with darkness? And how can you ever hope to win by fighting with darkness? Bring the light in and the darkness is found no more.\nYou are surrounded by many darknesses: greed, anger, jealousy, lust, ambition, ego. These are layers of darkness. If you start fighting with all these layers of darkness you are not going to win, because there is no way to fight with darkness directly. Darkness does not exist in the first place; it is only the absence of light. So if you want to do something with darkness, don’t try to do it directly, do something with light. If you want darkness, put the light out. If you don’t want darkness, put the light on. But do something with the light, forget about darkness. If the light is there, darkness is not there. If the light is not there, you cannot avoid darkness. You can close your eyes, you can try to forget about it, you can become occupied somewhere else, you can take your mind far far away from it, but it is there all the same. And it will show in your acts, in your thoughts, in your behavior. It will come up again and again. You cannot hide it – it is impossible to hide it. The truth of your being, whatsoever it is, is bound to surface.\nLisa, become aware. And I am not saying what is wrong and what is right. I am simply saying: Be aware; or, awareness is right and unawareness is wrong. When you are aware, things will start changing of their own accord, and then the mind functions as a servant. It is a machine, a beautiful machine, one of the most complex machines invented by nature in thousands of years. Man has not yet been able to create anything comparable to it. Even the best computer is not yet so capable.\nA single human mind can contain all the libraries of the world. It is almost infinite. Its capacity is great, its use is great, but it should be your servant not your master. As a servant it is beautiful; as a master it is dangerous.\nLet consciousness be your master and mind your servant. It happens through awareness. And I am not telling you to control it, because all control is repression. I am not telling you to fight, because all fight is a sheer waste of energy. You are fighting with your own servant – you are wasting your energy. You need not fight with your servant, you have simply to say, “I am the master”; that’s all. You have simply to be the master, that’s all, and the servant bows down. The servant immediately understands that the master has come in. And how does the master come in? The moment you become awake, the master comes in.\nYou ask me, Lisa: You SAY: GO BEYOND THE MIND. DO NOT LISTEN TO ITS CHATTER. DISCIPLINE IT AND MAKE IT A SERVANT. DO NOT BE ITS SLAVE. BUT HOW TO KNOW WHEN THE MIND IS BEING DISCIPLINED AND WHEN IT IS BEING REPRESSED?\nIt is very simple. Nobody can ever mistake the two, nobody can ever confuse the two. They are so different – just like light and darkness, just like love and hate, just like flowers and thorns, just like poison and nectar. They are so totally different! But if you think about them you may get confused. In thinking you cannot make the distinction. Don’t think about them – experiment, experience, and the distinction will be absolutely clear.\nYou also say: OSHO... WHEN I TOOK SANNYAS THE OTHER NIGHT YOU SAID NOT TO GET HOOKED ON YOU. I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE CLOSING THE STABLE DOOR AFTER THIS PARTICULAR HORSE HAS ALREADY BOLTED.\nLisa, I am not only a horse doctor but a horse lover too! And when I see a good horse I immediately fall in love. I believe in love at first sight, because it saves time! The moment I saw you, Lisa, the moment I saw tears of joy, love, trust and surrender in your eyes, I accepted you deep down as part of the orange Mafia!\nAnd I say, “Don’t get hooked on me,” only when I know that you are absolutely hooked and there is no way to escape! I don’t say it to everybody. I say it only to those who are already in. They may not be aware of it; they may become aware of it later on.\nI have seen it. You are hooked, you are stoned on me. Now there is no going back. Now this is going to be your whole world. I am your home. I say it only when I am absolutely certain, categorically certain, that there is no possibility of your going away, when I see that you are melting and merging. Then only, just to be generous, do I say, “Don’t get hooked on me.” I can afford to say it when I know that Lisa is finished!\nThe second question Question 2\nOSHO, WHAT IS THE ESSENCE OF BUDDHA DHARMA – THE RELIGION OF THE BUDDHA?\nMouna,\nYOKA SAYS\nIF YOU REACH THE ZEN OF BUDDHA, AT THAT VERY MOMENT YOU ACCOMPLISH EVERYTHING.\nIN YOUR DREAM THERE ARE MANY PATHWAYS, BUT WHEN YOU WAKE UP, THEY ARE REDUCED TO NOTHING. NEITHER ERROR, NOR HAPPINESS, NOR LOSS, NOR GAIN.\nDO NOT TRY TO FIND ANYTHING IN THE ESSENCE OF YOUR BEING. IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE YOU WIPED THE DUST FROM YOUR MIRROR, NOW IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO SEE ITS BRILLIANCY PERFECTLY.\nWHO CAN NOT-THINK, ALL IS HIS. IF YOU PRACTICE CHARITY IN ORDER TO BECOME BUDDHA WHEN WILL YOU SUCCEED? NEVER – A THOUSAND TIMES NEVER.\nDRINK AND EAT ACCORDING TO YOUR TRUE NATURE. ALL THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE ARE IMPERMANENT, AND THEREFORE ALL EXISTENCE IS VOID. THAT IS THE WHOLE UNDERSTANDING OF BUDDHA.\nThis is the essence of Buddha Dharma, the religion of the Buddha. First: it is not a philosophy that you can understand intellectually; you have to become a Buddha to know it. Hence Yoka says:\nIF YOU REACH THE ZEN OF BUDDHA – the state of the Buddha – AT THAT VERY MOMENT YOU ACCOMPLISH EVERYTHING.\nNothing is missing when you reach the ultimate state of awakening; all is fulfilled, you are utterly contented. Life is known for the first time as a great significance, as a great dance, a celebration. Life is known for the first time as absolutely perfect. There is no complaint, no desire, no hankering for things to be other than they are. One is simply contented, totally contented. All desiring disappears.\nAnd what is the state of Buddha? What is this “Zen of Buddha” Yoka is talking about? It is the state of nomind. Hence Yoka says:\nWHO CAN NOT-THINK, ALL IS HIS.\nThe greatest thing in life to experience is a state of nothought. The greatest art of life is to be able to be without mind. Even if it happens for a single moment – just a glimpse – you have reached the beyond and you have crossed the point of no-return.\nDon’t go on thinking about it – what it is. By thinking you will go on missing it. Thinking is the sure way of missing the Buddha Dharma; non-thinking is the way to achieve it. It is your own nature!\nBuddha does not talk about some great mysteries, hidden secrets, esoteric knowledge. He does not believe in mythology; he is not an occultist. He is a very simple man, very ordinary. He believes in the ordinary existence. He says your day-to-day life is all there is. If you can live it joyfully, silently, understandingly, watchfully, there is nothing else to be done. Your very ordinary life starts becoming extraordinary.\nDRINK AND EAT, YOKA SAYS, ACCORDING TO YOUR TRUE NATURE.\nJust remember: don’t distort your nature, remain true to your nature. Listen to your own nature and follow it. Don’t follow anybody else.\nBuddha says, “Even if you meet me on the way, kill me immediately.” He is saying: Don’t follow me, just take the hints. Try to understand, imbibe the spirit. Feel my presence and then go on your way. Live according to your own light, howsoever small it is; but if it is yours and you live according to it, it will go on growing.\nBuddha says, “Be a light unto yourself.” That is his greatest message. Nobody else in the whole world, in the whole history of humanity, has been so respectful towards others as Gautam the Buddha. “Be a light unto yourself.”\nBuddhas only point the way – fingers pointing to the moon. You have to follow, and you have to follow according to your nature. You have to be silent, quiet, so you can listen to the still small voice within you, and then follow it. Wherever it leads it is good. Go in deep trust, following your own voice. Be spontaneous, natural, ordinary. This is the way of being extraordinary. Be ordinary but aware, and the ordinary becomes the sacred.\nALL THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE ARE IMPERMANENT...\nSo don’t be worried. All things are impermanent: pleasure and pain, friendship and enmity, poverty and richness, success and failure, birth and death. All is in a flux, all is impermanent, so why be worried? Everything goes on changing. Don’t cling – clinging brings misery, clinging shows your misunderstanding. The moment you cling to something you are living with the idea that it can be permanent. Nothing can be permanent, and nothing can be done about it. It is just the nature of things to be impermanent.\nYou are trying to catch hold of rainbows. They are beautiful, but you cannot catch hold of them – one moment they are there and another moment they are gone. So don’t cling to anything because everything is impermanent. And don’t desire anything because even if you get it, you will lose it. If you don’t get it, you will be frustrated. If you get it and lose it, you will be frustrated. Either way you will be in misery, you are inviting misery. So don’t desire anything and don’t cling to anything.\nWhatsoever comes, accept it. Buddha calls it tathata, suchness. Just accept it, live through it silently, without being disturbed by it. Misery comes, it will go. Happiness comes, it will go. Everything passes away, nothing abides, so there is nothing to worry about.\nGo on passing through all kinds of experiences, and then you will know that one can pass through the world uncontaminated, uncorrupted. One can live in the palaces without clinging, then he is a sannyasin; and one can live in a hut and can cling to the hut, then he is not a sannyasin.\nThat’s why I don’t tell you to renounce the world, I simply say: Be watchful. That is the essence of Buddha’s message.\nPeople ask me, “But Buddha renounced the world. Why did he renounce?” He renounced when he was not a Buddha. He renounced when he was as ignorant as anybody else. He renounced in ignorance.\nWhen he attained the truth, when he experienced the truth and came back home, his wife asked him only one question. “Just tell me one thing,” she asked. “Whatsoever you have attained... I can see you are a transformed being. You have become luminous, you are no longer the same person. The old is gone, you are reborn. It is so clear to me – even a blind person like me can see it. But just answer me one question. Whatsoever you have attained, was it not possible to attain it living here with me in this palace?”\nAnd the story is: Buddha remained silent, looking downwards. The wife was right. He didn’t say anything.\nIn the East, not saying anything is thought to be a sign of agreement: MOUNAM SAMMATI LAKSHANAM. “To be silent means I agree with you.” It says more than Buddha saying yes. His silence says more, it is more pregnant with meaning.\nHe immediately felt it: “She is right.” Whatsoever he had attained could have been attained anywhere. There was no need to go into the jungle.\nThere is no need for you to go anywhere. Wherever you are you can assert your Buddhahood, you can become awakened.\nThe essence is to slip out of the mind, to get out of the mind. The mind is the world. The mind is full of desires, full of clingings, attachments, longings. Get out of the mind! Create a little distance between you and the mind. Be a watcher, a watcher on the hills, and you will be surprised: as you watch the mind, the distance becomes bigger and bigger. As you watch the mind, as you become more and more established in watching, the mind recedes farther and farther away. One day it happens: you cannot hear the chatter of the mind; it is no longer there. It is simply, absolutely silent. In that silence, truth descends in you. In that silence, you encounter yourself, you encounter your innermost core. And that is the innermost core of the whole existence. Your being is the being of all.\nWe are separate as minds, as bodies, but not as consciousness. In consciousness we meet, we are one. That consciousness is God. That meeting, that oneness where all differences dissolve, where we are no longer separate ice cubes, where we have melted and disappeared into the universal, Buddha calls nirvana. The word is beautiful; it means cessation of the ego. When the ego ceases you are God, you are a Buddha, you are a Christ. It is the ego that is giving you a limitation. It is the ego that is making you live in a prison. Get out of the ego! And nobody is preventing you – it is your own clinging, it is your own attachment. You have become too attached to your chains, you have become too attached to your prison cell. You think it is your home, and it is not. Come out of it! Wake up!\nTo be awake is to be a Buddha. And Yoka is right.\nIF YOU REACH THE ZEN OF BUDDHA – the state of Buddha – AT THAT VERY MOMENT YOU ACCOMPLISH EVERYTHING.\nThe third question Question 3\nOSHO,\nWHEN YOU SPEAK OF RELIGIONS, YOU USUALLY MENTION CHRISTIANS, MOHAMMEDANS AND HINDUS, BUT NOT JEWS. IS THERE A REASON FOR IT?\nVeet Ateet,\nTHERE IS A REASON: I am the only Jew in India!\nOnce I was taken in a Cadillac car; the owner wanted to sell it. I was interested – I have used all kinds of cars except the Cadillac. It was a beautiful car, specially made. I loved it.\nHe asked me, “What do you say? How did you feel in it?”\nI said, “I felt just like a Jew! I will not purchase this car – this will show my identity. I am already in more trouble than a man can manage. Now to declare myself a Jew will be inviting even more trouble. Jews are experts at inviting trouble!”\nOne old Jew was praying to God for years and never asking for anything. God became fed up. If you ask for something, something can be done and he can get rid of you! But he was not asking for anything; he was just praying and praying and praying.\nSo one day God said, “Listen! What do you want? Why don’t you say exactly what you want? I am ready to fulfil it.”\nThe old Jew said, “Is it true that we are your chosen people?” God said, “Yes, that’s true.”\nThe Jew said, “Now please choose somebody else. For three thousand years, just because of you, we have suffered so much. Enough is enough! Now you choose somebody else!”\nVeet Ateet, you must be a Jew also, otherwise why this question? Jews are always thinking, in every possible way, about Jews.\nThe Friends of the Elephant Society – a society created to help sick, old or homeless elephants – decided that although most people knew what an elephant was, there had never been any serious, definitive study conducted about the huge animal. They therefore decided to hold a competition with a prize of a thousand dollars to be given for the best book on the subject of the elephant.\nAn Englishman enters his book entitled: “The History and Statistics of the Elephant.”\nA German enters a three-volume set entitled: “The Anatomy and Physiology of the Elephant.”\nA Frenchman enters a slim, hundred-page volume entitled: “The Amorous Affairs of the Elephant.”\nAn Italian seriously considers the project for about five minutes, then drops it and joins his friends for some spaghetti.\nAnd a Jew enters an epic effort entitled: “The Elephant and the Jewish Problem.”\nNow, Ateet, why does this question come to your mind? I don’t say much about Judaism because in India there are no Jews. Hindus are there, Christians are there, Mohammedans are there, Jainas are there, Buddhists are there; only Jews are missing, so I don’t mention them much. Of course, Jews are not missing here. This must be the only place in the whole of India where you can find thousands of Jews – but they are no longer Jews.\nAteet, this must be a hangover with you. Do you know what your name means? Veet Ateet means going beyond the past. You still seem to have a hangover of being Jewish. And having thousands of Jews here, it is better not to talk about them because they are very argumentative people.\nA Christian visiting the Holy Land struck up a conversation with an Israeli. “I am really surprised that you and the Arabs can’t get together peacefully.”\n“My dear man,” said the Israeli, “the Jews are a very argumentative people. The only thing you can get two Jews to agree upon is what a third Jew should give to charity.”\nThat is true.\nJimmy finally got Sadat and Begin together for a resumption of the Mid-East peace talks.\nAfterwards Sadat said, “I’m glad we buried the hatchet. In the future I wish you everything you wish me.”\nBegin answered, “See, you’re starting up again.”\nThat’s why, Ateet, I don’t mention Jews very much. It is dangerous! Surrounded by thousands of Jews it is better not to mention Jews at all.\nAnd, moreover, Judaism is a dead religion, just as Hinduism is. In fact, there have been only two source religions in the world: Hinduism and Judaism. Both are dead. Jainism and Buddhism are offshoots of Hinduism but because the root is dead the branches are dead too. And Christianity and Islam are branches of Judaism, and because the root is dead the branches are dead too. These are dead phenomena. I am not much concerned with the past.\nYes, something beautiful has happened in Judaism, too, and that is Hassidism – and I have talked about it a lot. Just as I love Zen people in the tradition of the Buddha, I love Hassids in the tradition of Moses and I love Sufis in the tradition of Mohammed. These three are still alive in some small way because these three have never become established religions; they have always been anti- establishment, they have always been alternatives to the established religion, they have always been rebellious.\nHassidism is worth talking about, not Judaism – and I have talked about Hassidism. I have been approaching Hassidism with my own experience. I have been bringing Hassidism up to date, trying to make it part of the twentieth century. Hassidism is the essence of Judaism, the very fragrance of it.\nAnd I have something of the Hassids in me, that’s why I sometimes call myself a Jew. The Hassids love life, they are life-affirmative. They don’t believe in renunciation, they believe in rejoicing. They believe in dancing, singing, celebrating – and that’s exactly my approach too.\nMy religion is something of a meeting of Zen, Sufism and Hassidism – and something more thrown in.\nThe fourth question Question 4\nOSHO,\nACTUALLY, I LOVE TO PHILOSOPHIZE. WHAT TO DO WITH THAT ABILITY IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?\nDeva Anurati,\nPHILOSOPHY IS A SHEER WASTE of your energy. The same energy can become your meditation, the same energy can become your awakening. Philosophy is like dreaming: you can dream beautiful dreams, but dreaming is dreaming. You can think of God, but to think of God is not to know God. To know about God is not to know God. The word “about” means around. You can go on around and around... you will be moving in a circle and you will never reach the target, because the target is the center not the circumference.\nPhilosophy is circumferential, peripheral. It can deceive you; it has deceived millions of people because it talks about love, about God, it even talks about meditation. It philosophizes about everything.\nBut philosophy means that your mind remains your master; it is mind that philosophizes. You have to go beyond mind, Anurati – and it is not going to happen through philosophy. It can happen only through meditation.\nNow you must be philosophizing about meditation: what it is, how to define it. There are thousands of definitions and you can be lost in the jungle of definitions.\nAnd I can understand your difficulty. You must be feeling a little out of place, because here philosophy is debarred. I am creating a non-philosophical atmosphere. The whole effort here is to help you go beyond mind. I don’t want you to think about love, I want you to love. I don’t want you to think about God, I want you to KNOW God, to BE God.\nWhat is the point when you are thirsty to go on thinking about water? Even if you discover by your thinking that water consists of H20, that is not going to quench your thirst. And that’s what philosophy is: H20. You are thirsty, and philosophy says, “Don’t be thirsty. Water is simply H20. Just write H20 on the paper and eat the paper!”\nPhilosophers go on eating the papers. They eat great things: Upanishads, Vedas, Korans, Bibles. They have a great appetite for paper! That’s why there is such a shortage of paper in the world: there are so many paper-eaters. Crazy people!\nYes, once in a while philosophy may be good, just for a change.\nMolly Landau was learning to drive a car. Regrettably, as it turned out, she thought she already knew how so she dismissed her driving instructor and ventured forth upon the public highway, unaccompanied by either an experienced hand or a driver’s license.\nAs she wobbled in an uncertain course along Southern Boulevard in the Bronx, a milkman driving a well-behaved horse turned a corner. Mrs Landau tried simultaneously to do several things: apply the brakes, avoid a collision, turn out, turn in, veer left, veer right, speed up, slow down, and who knows what else.\nThe “what else” was that she banged squarely into the side of the milk-wagon, leaving it turned over on its side in the middle of the street, with the horse and driver entangled in the wreckage.\nThe lady, losing her head, at the same time lost control of the car. She sped away, swerved out of sight and on squealing tires she circled the block. A minute later she reappeared at the scene of the accident, still wrestling with the steering wheel. The dairyman, who had managed to extricate himself from the mess, was cutting his struggling horse loose from the twisted harness when he heard the clatter and roar of an approaching, wide-open engine. He looked up to see the same car and the same woman again bearing down on him. Just in time to save himself, he jumped aside.\nThere was a second crash and once more the green motorist proceeded on her devastating way. But now the capsized wagon was a total loss. The milkman was a natural-born philosopher. As he stood in the midst of the ruins, he shrugged his shoulders and remarked to the curious citizens who had gathered around, “About that lady’s driving, I can’t say she’s an expert. But you have to give her credit – she’s thorough!”\nYes, in such situations, a little philosophy is good: it helps you to keep cool. But more than that it is of no use, Anurati. You will have to learn a new way of being. If you are here – and you are here – stop philosophizing. Start experiencing, because it is only through experience that one comes to know the truth.\nTruth is not a conclusion arrived at by logical argumentation, truth is not arrived at through syllogism, truth is an experience of a silent, still consciousness.\nLearn to be more silent and still.\nThis is the first question from Anurati that I am answering. She must have asked hundreds of questions – I go on throwing them away. The moment I see Anurati’s name, the question goes into the wastepaper basket for the simple reason that I don’t want to nourish her philosophical mind. If I start talking about her philosophical problems she will get more and more into them.\nShe goes on asking me, “You answer everybody’s question. Why don’t you answer my question?” So today I decided that at least one question should be answered.\nPhilosophy is a disease – and I know it first-hand! I have been a professor of philosophy – you can trust me! I have suffered from it and I know it is very chronic. Once it enters into your system it is\nvery difficult to throw it out. I have every sympathy for Anurati, but if the right effort is made you can get rid of it; it is not incurable. And because it never gives you anything... It promises much, but it never supplies any goods.\nJust look back. What has it given to you? It makes people great bullshitters, that’s all! They go on talking about great things they know nothing of. It may give you a very polished ego, but this is the problem that has to be solved, it is not the solution.\nAnurati, wake up from your philosophical dream! Howsoever sweet it is, it is a dream. And it is so useless that you can always find an argument for anything. Philosophy is a prostitute: it can go with anybody.\nMeditate on Murphy’s maxim: To every Ph.D. there is an equal and opposite Ph.D.\nYou can argue for, you can argue against. Philosophy has no anchor. It is a game, like chess: it keeps you occupied and gives you a sense of doing something great. But remember, it is all dreaming.\nOne night Zorba the Greek dreamed that he had to leave his island. So he went down to the port and stepped aboard a boat.\nThe captain stopped him and said, “You’ll have to pay one hundred drachmas.”\n“That’s sheer robbery!” exclaimed Zorba. “I won’t give you more than fifty drachmas.” “One hundred or you will have to swim!”\n“Is that so?” Zorba said. “You better take me for fifty drachmas or I’ll wake up and you’ll lose everything!”\nAnurati, please wake up! But people are afraid to wake up. The fear is they will lose everything because all that they have is nothing but dream stuff. Their philosophy is their dream, their religion is their dream, their knowledge is their dream, their ego is their dream. In their dream they have gathered many things, hence they are afraid to wake up, because the moment they wake up all is lost.\nOne night Mulla Nasruddin dreamed that a man wanted to give him some money. He was very generous, but Mulla was insistent, “Give me a hundred rupees.”\nAnd the man was saying, “Take ninety... ninety-one... ninety-two... ninety-three.”\nBut Mulla was insistent on a hundred rupees because Mulla could see that the man was so generous, he looked so kind that he might agree on a hundred rupees, so why settle for less?\nThe man said, “Listen. For the last time, take ninety-nine.\nMulla said, “One hundred!” But he said it so loudly that he woke up. He opened his eyes – the man had disappeared and the money had disappeared.\nHe immediately closed his eyes and he said, “Okay, okay. Give me ninety-nine!” But now there was nobody there. He said, “Don’t be so angry. Ninety-eight... ninety-seven...” But there was nobody there at all. It was all a dream.\nYou are dreaming beautiful dreams. Philosophy is a very clever dream.\nAnurati, get out of it! And this is not the place to philosophize; you can do it anywhere else. Such stupid things can be done anywhere. For such stupid things you need not come from America to India! Do something real, do something authentic. Do something that will transform your life, that will give you a new birth.\n“Unless you are born again you cannot enter into my kingdom of God.” The fifth question\nQuestion 5 OSHO,\nI HAVE TRAVELED ALL OVER INDIA, BUT I HAVE NEVER HEARD AN ILL WORD SPOKEN OF THIS TOWN, POONA.\nNaresh,\nPERHAPS IT IS because one should not speak ill of the dead! The sixth question\nQuestion 6\nOSHO, WHY ARE YOU AGAINST THE GREEKS? WHY DO YOU CALL THEM THE “GODDAMNED GREEKS”?\nVeera,\nTHE GREEKS ARE GREAT PEOPLE – I love them. I love Socrates, I love Pythagoras, I love Heraclitus – and, of course, I love Mukta. But they are “goddamned.”\nA Russian can be cheated only by a gipsy, a gipsy by Jew, a Jew by a Greek, and a Greek only by the devil.\nThe seventh question Question 7\nOSHO, I AM BRITISH. ANYTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT?\nMark,\nTHIS TIME IT IS TOO LATE. Next time be a little more careful in choosing your parents! The eighth question\nQuestion 8\nOSHO, CAN CHILDREN UNDERSTAND THE TRUTH? RAJ,\nCHILDREN CAN UNDERSTAND THE TRUTH but cannot understand that they understand it. They understand more clearly than you can understand because they are more clean, more innocent; but they are so innocent that they cannot understand that they understand.\nHence you need another childhood, a second childhood. First you have to lose your first childhood. That is the whole meaning of the biblical story of Adam and Eve losing paradise: that is losing the first childhood. It is a tremendously significant story. It has so many meanings, it is such a multi-dimensional parable, that I don’t think there exists any other parable comparable to it.\nYou can look at it from many aspects. It is losing the first childhood – which is inevitable. Adam and Eve are not committing a sin. In fact, the word “sin” comes from a root which means forgetting, and that is a beautiful meaning: they are simply forgetting something.\nEvery child has to forget his innocence. Every child has to get lost in the world. Every child has to go astray has to make many many mistakes, has to suffer, has to pass through pain and pleasure and all kinds of dualities so that one day he can again start feeling a great longing to go back home. Lost in the deserts of the world, a longing arises one day to go back home.\nThat longing is sannyas, that longing is religion. And then one consciously comes back again to one’s childhood; this is the second childhood. Now one understands and also understands that one understands. The first childhood is very innocent; it is bound to be lost because it is a natural gift, God’s gift. The second childhood is never lost because it is your earning, you have become worthy of it. It is no longer a gift; you deserve it. It is growth, not a gift. It is your maturity.\nAdam and Eve lose their first childhood, and it is in people like Buddha and Jesus Christ and Zarathustra and Moses that the second childhood happens. In Christ, Adam starts moving back towards paradise. If Adam is the going away from paradise, Jesus is the coming back home.\nBut if you watch children you will see how clear they are about things – far more clear than you are. You are very much confused; you have so many thoughts to confuse you. Children are not confused – they don’t have any thoughts to confuse them. Their flames are burning bright with no smoke. They are full of wonder and awe, and the moment they see something they immediately understand, because there is no barrier.\nIf we can help children to be meditative we can change the whole world – its energy, its consciousness. But we teach them something else, never meditation – geography, history, and all kinds of nonsense which is absolutely useless. Now, what does it matter where Timbuktoo is? 1\ndon’t know; I simply love the name Timbuktoo – wherever it is! But children are being taught about stupid kings – Genghis Khan and Nadir Shah and Tamburlaine. For what? Why are you filling their heads with rubbish?\nThis is the moment to make them aware because they are naturally aware. If we help them to understand their awareness and their innocence, the first childhood can become a movement into the second childhood.\nA French farmer’s son missed a day in school and explained to the teacher that he was absent because of important family business.\n“I had to take the bull to the cows,” he explained.\n“But couldn’t your father do that better?” the teacher wanted to know.\n“I suppose my father is a pretty good lover,” the French lad said, “but in this case I think the bull does it better.”\nThey are more clear about things than your so-called knowledgeable people.\nCalifornia is full of crazies. Even the doctors are crazy. A troubled young lady went to consult an M.D., complaining that she was having trouble with her menstrual cycle.\n“No problem, chick,” said the medico.’Why don’t you just trade it in for a Honda?” During a visit to the zoo a youngster asked his mother, “Mom, how do lions screw?” She replied, “I really don’t know, dear, most of your father’s friends are Rotarians.”\n“My new husband is a sex maniac,” complained the young lady to the judge. “Ever since the honeymoon he has been making non-stop love to me. I can’t get no rest day or night. I want a divorce.”\n“All right,” said the judge, “but first you’ll have to file your application.”\n“File my application!” exclaimed the lady indignantly. “Why, that poor thing is so sore I can’t even bear to touch it!”\nA schoolteacher bent too low over her desk to mark a paper and little Johnny in the front seat said, “Teacher, I see something.\n“That’s very rude, Johnny. Tomorrow don’t come to school,” the teacher admonished.\nA week later, the teacher bent down to pick up a piece of chalk. Johnny, still in a ringside seat, got up and started to walk to the door. “Where are you going?” asked the teacher sternly.\n“Teacher, my schooldays are over.”\nChildren see very clearly; their eyes are transparent. But soon they have to lose their innocence. We force them to lose it. We fill their heads with such rubbish that their eyes stop seeing. Every parent is trying, every society is trying, every church is trying to fill the child’s mind with stupid things before he starts becoming aware on his own; otherwise he will be a rebel. So by the time you are three or four years old, things have already started being poured into you. You are sent to the church, you are being taught religion – as if religion can be taught.\nReligion cannot be taught, it can only be caught. You can catch it only when you are in the company of a man like Jesus or Buddha. When you are in the company of a man like Yoka, Rinzai, Bodhidharma, you can catch it; it is infectious. But it cannot be taught. A religion that is taught – it is rubbish. But we are very interested in making our children Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan as soon as possible.\nIn a better world, in a more human world, at least up to the age of twenty-one, children should not be taught any Christianity, Hinduism, Jainism, Judaism, no. Up to the age of twenty-one – when they become capable of voting – they should be left to inquire on their own. And I assure you, Christianity, Jainism, Buddhism, Judaism, Mohammedanism, will all disappear from the world. Just leave children to themselves up to their twenty-first year and then try to teach them Christianity! They will raise such questions that even you will start suspecting whether Christianity is of any worth. But you force poor children three years of age... They cannot resist, they cannot protect themselves. They depend on you for their survival, so you can do anything.\nAnd this is the greatest crime that can be done to children. Parents have been criminals throughout the whole past, and the greatest crime is that you condition your children’s minds and you don’t allow them the freedom to seek and search and inquire for themselves. Of course, parents have not done it knowingly; their parents had conditioned them and they were simply repeating a pattern. And they were thinking that they were doing it for your own good. In fact, the greatest crimes have been committed for your own good. Whenever somebody says, “I am doing it for your own good,” beware, because nobody needs to do anything for your own good.\nYes, parents need to feed you, to clothe you, to support you, to make you strong in body, to support you in your inquiry, in your questioning, to give you every kind of support and protection so that you can freely inquire. The whole world will be full of agnostics, inquirers, and that will be the beginning of a true religion on the earth. And it has to happen from the very childhood because it is such a stupid waste of time to first destroy their minds, because then it becomes very hard, very difficult to uncondition them. They start resisting because then they start getting identified with their own minds.\nEvery day I receive questions – rude questions, ugly questions – because whenever somebody feels hurt, immediately his conditioned mind reacts and he writes something in anger.\nI am trying to help you to be on your own, to be free, and you get angry because you don’t want to be free. You have become accustomed to being slaves. But you don’t think it is slavery; you think it is knowledge, it is wisdom. You think you know the Bible, you know the Gita, you know the Koran. And when I go on destroying, negating, you become scared. If all your knowledge is taken away, what is left? You are very afraid of nothingness – and that is the true beginning, that is the beginning of a new birth.\nEverybody has to become again a nothing, again a child, again innocent; only then will you be able to understand truth.\nChildren are capable of understanding it, but they are not capable of understanding that they understand it. For that you have to wait a little. But we can prepare the children. We can use their capacity to understand to make them more free, to make them more adventurous, to make them more courageous.\nIf you really love your children you will help them to go on an adventure so that they can find God by themselves. It is beautiful to find truth; it is ugly to carry somebody else’s truth on your shoulders. It is simply a dead weight. It cripples, kills; it poisons you.\nThe last question Question 9\nOSHO, THERE’S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT, SARJANO IS MY LSD: A LATIN-SEDUCING-DON JUAN. THE ASHRAM SEEMS TO BE THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT AND I KNOW YOU ARE GUIDING ME THROUGH THE TRIP, BUT WHAT’S THE RIGHT DOSE TO TAKE HIM IN?\nSatya Bharti,\nSARJANO IS a ladies’ man, so don’t waste your time in thinking about the right dose to take him in because tomorrow he may not be available. Eat him totally if you can! There is just one thing you have to be aware of: if you don’t like spaghetti, then eating him is going to be a torture – it will be all spaghetti!\nWhat did the cannibal say after he ate the Italian? “The meat’s a little on the greasy side.”\nSo eat him while he is available and don’t waste time in thinking about right proportions – how much and how much not.\nSarjano is like the wind: today he is here, tomorrow somewhere else. And remember perfectly well: eat him before he eats you, because these Italians are really dangerous people!\nJust the other day there was a question: “What is more dangerous than an Italian?” Of course, two Italians!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"8084","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/walking_in_zen_sitting_in_zen/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/walking_in_zen_sitting_in_zen/>Walking in Zen, Sitting in Zen</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">3 \...

DISCIPLINE IT AND MAKE IT A SERVANT. DO NOT BE ITS SLAVE. BUT HOW TO
KNOW WHEN THE MIND IS BEING DISCIPLINED AND WHEN IT IS BEING REPRESSED?
ALSO, WHEN I TOOK SANNYAS THE OTHER NIGHT YOU SAID NOT TO GET HOOKED ON
YOU. I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE CLOSING THE STABLE DOOR AFTER THIS
PARTICULAR HORSE HAS ALREADY BOLTED.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Lisa,</p><p><br></p><p>THE DIFFERENCE IS SO GREAT that it is impossible to miss it.
Repression happens through fighting with your mind. Discipline happens
through being watchful, aware, alert. In discipline, there is no fight
implied. In discipline, there is no condemnation, no evaluation. One
simply looks at the mind silently, seeing the whole traffic, without
saying what is right and what is wrong, what should be and what should
not be, just as, standing by the side of the road, you watch the people
walking by – saints and sinners, beautiful people, ugly people, good
people, bad people – but you are unconcerned. It has nothing to do with
you; you are out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s exactly the meaning of the English word “ecstasy”. Ecstasy
means to be out of the mind. You are just looking, as one looks at the
clouds moving in the sky or at the river flowing by – cool,</p><p>detached. Neither are you trying to cling to something nor are you
trying to push something away from you.</p><p><br></p><p>This is pure awareness: you are only a mirror. And in just being a
mirror, the miracle happens – the miracle of discipline. Slowly slowly,
the traffic starts disappearing. Less and less thoughts are moving on
the road, less and less pictures are appearing on the screen, less and
less memories, fantasies. Gaps start appearing.</p><p><br></p><p>A mother was telling her child, “Be very careful when you go to
school because the traffic is dangerous at rush hour time.”</p><p><br></p><p>The child said, “Don’t be worried. I always wait by the side of the
road. When a gap comes by, then I cross the road.”</p><p><br></p><p>“When a gap comes by...” As you are looking at your mind you will be
surprised: gaps come by, intervals when there is nothing to be seen. The
observer remains alone and because it is alone it is no longer an
observer either. You can’t call it an observer because there is nothing
to observe. The mirror is there, but it is not reflecting anything.
There is no duality of the seen and the seer. In these intervals
discipline arises.</p><p><br></p><p>The word “discipline” is also beautiful. It is sometimes very
significant to go to the roots of words. “Discipline” comes from a root
which means learning. When you are looking at a gap, learning happens.
Learning about what? Learning about yourself, because there is nothing
else. You are full of awareness. You are just full of your own being,
overflowing. And this experience of just being yourself, overflowing,
undistracted by anything, undisturbed by anything, is the greatest
learning, the greatest possibility of knowing the truth. This is
discipline.</p><p><br></p><p>From the same root comes the word “disciple.” “Disciple” means one
who is becoming capable of being utterly silent in the presence of the
Master. The disciple is one who allows the interval to happen when he is
with the Master. With the Master you are bridged only through silence;
when there is nothing in your mind you are bridged. Something then
transpires between the Master and the disciple. A flame jumps from the
Master into the heart of the disciple. The unlit candle of the disciple
suddenly becomes lit. All is joy and light and love, and a great dance
arises.</p><p><br></p><p>Lisa, discipline can never be misunderstood as repression.
Repressions are totally different. In repression you have already
decided what is wrong – a priori decisions. In fact, others have decided
for you what is wrong and what is right. Now you are simply trying to
impose the ideas and opinions of others upon yourself. You will have to
repress your nature. You will have to force that which is wrong – or
which you have been told is wrong – deep into the unconscious. There
will be a fight, great turmoil. Instead of bringing silence to you,
every method of repression brings more turmoil.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why the so-called religious people are more restless, more
worried. You are worried only about this world, they are worried even
about the other. You are worried only about this life, they are worried
about many many past lives and future lives. Your worries are nothing
compared to the worries of the so-called religious people. And they are
sitting on a volcano, because whatsoever is repressed is there; it is
not destroyed. Repression never destroys anything; you are simply
sitting on top of it. And the danger is that you cannot sit on top of it
for twenty-four hours a day; you have</p><p>limitations. You will get tired, you will need some rest. And
whenever you will be tired and you will need rest, repressions will
start arising in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, even your greatest saints go on thinking, fantasizing,
dreaming about all those things that they have repressed.</p><p><br></p><p>Mahatma Gandhi has written in his autobiography: “I have been able to
control my sexuality as far as my day is concerned, but in the night, in
my dreams, it comes with a vengeance.” This he was writing at the age of
seventy... a whole life of repression!</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, in the day you can somehow manage, but in the night, in the
dreams, that which you have repressed in the day is bound to take
revenge. It will come back, it will explode in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, down the ages your saints have been very much afraid of sleep.
They go on cutting down on their sleep – five hours, four hours, three
hours, two hours. And the less they sleep the greater the danger,
because all their repressions have to come in those two hours in a very
condensed way. Then they are crowding in from everywhere. And people
worship them! The less a saint sleeps, the more people worship him. They
say, “Look how much he has sacrificed! What a great austerity he is
doing – he is not even sleeping! Or he sleeps for only two hours or one
hour.”</p><p><br></p><p>The reality is that he is afraid of sleep. And from where is the fear
coming? The fear is coming from the fact that when you are awake you can
control, but when you are asleep, who is there to control? The
controller is asleep, is in a relaxed state. He cannot sit on top of all
the repressions, and they will assert themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>So, Lisa, if you are fighting with anything, then it is not
discipline. I don’t teach fight, I teach awareness. It is useless to
fight with the darkness, utterly useless and stupid. Bring the light in.
Why fight with darkness? And how can you ever hope to win by fighting
with darkness? Bring the light in and the darkness is found no more.</p><p><br></p><p>You are surrounded by many darknesses: greed, anger, jealousy, lust,
ambition, ego. These are layers of darkness. If you start fighting with
all these layers of darkness you are not going to win, because there is
no way to fight with darkness directly. Darkness does not exist in the
first place; it is only the absence of light. So if you want to do
something with darkness, don’t try to do it directly, do something with
light. If you want darkness, put the light out. If you don’t want
darkness, put the light on. But do something with the light, forget
about darkness. If the light is there, darkness is not there. If the
light is not there, you cannot avoid darkness. You can close your eyes,
you can try to forget about it, you can become occupied somewhere else,
you can take your mind far far away from it, but it is there all the
same. And it will show in your acts, in your thoughts, in your behavior.
It will come up again and again. You cannot hide it – it is impossible
to hide it. The truth of your being, whatsoever it is, is bound to
surface.</p><p><br></p><p>Lisa, become aware. And I am not saying what is wrong and what is
right. I am simply saying: Be aware; or, awareness is right and
unawareness is wrong. When you are aware, things will start changing of
their own accord, and then the mind functions as a servant. It is a
machine, a beautiful machine, one of the most complex machines invented
by nature in thousands of years. Man has not yet been able to create
anything comparable to it. Even the best computer is not yet so
capable.</p><p>A single human mind can contain all the libraries of the world. It is
almost infinite. Its capacity is great, its use is great, but it should
be your servant not your master. As a servant it is beautiful; as a
master it is dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>Let consciousness be your master and mind your servant. It happens
through awareness. And I am not telling you to control it, because all
control is repression. I am not telling you to fight, because all fight
is a sheer waste of energy. You are fighting with your own servant – you
are wasting your energy. You need not fight with your servant, you have
simply to say, “I am the master”; that’s all. You have simply to be the
master, that’s all, and the servant bows down. The servant immediately
understands that the master has come in. And how does the master come
in? The moment you become awake, the master comes in.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask me, Lisa: You SAY: GO BEYOND THE MIND. DO NOT LISTEN TO ITS
CHATTER. DISCIPLINE IT AND MAKE IT A SERVANT. DO NOT BE ITS SLAVE. BUT
HOW TO KNOW WHEN THE MIND IS BEING DISCIPLINED AND WHEN IT IS BEING
REPRESSED?</p><p><br></p><p>It is very simple. Nobody can ever mistake the two, nobody can ever
confuse the two. They are so different – just like light and darkness,
just like love and hate, just like flowers and thorns, just like poison
and nectar. They are so totally different! But if you think about them
you may get confused. In thinking you cannot make the distinction. Don’t
think about them – experiment, experience, and the distinction will be
absolutely clear.</p><p><br></p><p>You also say: OSHO... WHEN I TOOK SANNYAS THE OTHER NIGHT YOU SAID
NOT TO GET HOOKED ON YOU. I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE CLOSING THE
STABLE DOOR AFTER THIS PARTICULAR HORSE HAS ALREADY BOLTED.</p><p><br></p><p>Lisa, I am not only a horse doctor but a horse lover too! And when I
see a good horse I immediately fall in love. I believe in love at first
sight, because it saves time! The moment I saw you, Lisa, the moment I
saw tears of joy, love, trust and surrender in your eyes, I accepted you
deep down as part of the orange Mafia!</p><p><br></p><p>And I say, “Don’t get hooked on me,” only when I know that you are
absolutely hooked and there is no way to escape! I don’t say it to
everybody. I say it only to those who are already in. They may not be
aware of it; they may become aware of it later on.</p><p><br></p><p>I have seen it. You are hooked, you are stoned on me. Now there is no
going back. Now this is going to be your whole world. I am your home. I
say it only when I am absolutely certain, categorically certain, that
there is no possibility of your going away, when I see that you are
melting and merging. Then only, just to be generous, do I say, “Don’t
get hooked on me.” I can afford to say it when I know that Lisa is
finished!</p><p><br></p><p>The second question Question 2</p><p>OSHO, WHAT IS THE ESSENCE OF BUDDHA DHARMA – THE RELIGION OF THE
BUDDHA?</p><p><br></p><p>Mouna,</p><p>YOKA SAYS</p><p><br></p><p>IF YOU REACH THE ZEN OF BUDDHA, AT THAT VERY MOMENT YOU ACCOMPLISH
EVERYTHING.</p><p><br></p><p>IN YOUR DREAM THERE ARE MANY PATHWAYS, BUT WHEN YOU WAKE UP, THEY ARE
REDUCED TO NOTHING. NEITHER ERROR, NOR HAPPINESS, NOR LOSS, NOR
GAIN.</p><p><br></p><p>DO NOT TRY TO FIND ANYTHING IN THE ESSENCE OF YOUR BEING. IT IS A
LONG TIME SINCE YOU WIPED THE DUST FROM YOUR MIRROR, NOW IT IS TIME FOR
YOU TO SEE ITS BRILLIANCY PERFECTLY.</p><p><br></p><p>WHO CAN NOT-THINK, ALL IS HIS. IF YOU PRACTICE CHARITY IN ORDER TO
BECOME BUDDHA WHEN WILL YOU SUCCEED? NEVER – A THOUSAND TIMES NEVER.</p><p><br></p><p>DRINK AND EAT ACCORDING TO YOUR TRUE NATURE. ALL THINGS IN THE
UNIVERSE ARE IMPERMANENT, AND THEREFORE ALL EXISTENCE IS VOID. THAT IS
THE WHOLE UNDERSTANDING OF BUDDHA.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the essence of Buddha Dharma, the religion of the Buddha.
First: it is not a philosophy that you can understand intellectually;
you have to become a Buddha to know it. Hence Yoka says:</p><p><br></p><p>IF YOU REACH THE ZEN OF BUDDHA – the state of the Buddha – AT THAT
VERY MOMENT YOU ACCOMPLISH EVERYTHING.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing is missing when you reach the ultimate state of awakening;
all is fulfilled, you are utterly contented. Life is known for the first
time as a great significance, as a great dance, a celebration. Life is
known for the first time as absolutely perfect. There is no complaint,
no desire, no hankering for things to be other than they are. One is
simply contented, totally contented. All desiring disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>And what is the state of Buddha? What is this “Zen of Buddha” Yoka is
talking about? It is the state of nomind. Hence Yoka says:</p><p><br></p><p>WHO CAN NOT-THINK, ALL IS HIS.</p><p><br></p><p>The greatest thing in life to experience is a state of nothought. The
greatest art of life is to be able to be without mind. Even if it
happens for a single moment – just a glimpse – you have reached the
beyond and you have crossed the point of no-return.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t go on thinking about it – what it is. By thinking you will go
on missing it. Thinking is the sure way of missing the Buddha Dharma;
non-thinking is the way to achieve it. It is your own nature!</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha does not talk about some great mysteries, hidden secrets,
esoteric knowledge. He does not believe in mythology; he is not an
occultist. He is a very simple man, very ordinary. He believes in the
ordinary existence. He says your day-to-day life is all there is. If you
can live it joyfully, silently, understandingly, watchfully, there is
nothing else to be done. Your very ordinary life starts becoming
extraordinary.</p><p>DRINK AND EAT, YOKA SAYS, ACCORDING TO YOUR TRUE NATURE.</p><p><br></p><p>Just remember: don’t distort your nature, remain true to your nature.
Listen to your own nature and follow it. Don’t follow anybody else.</p><p>Buddha says, “Even if you meet me on the way, kill me immediately.”
He is saying: Don’t follow me, just take the hints. Try to understand,
imbibe the spirit. Feel my presence and then go on your way. Live
according to your own light, howsoever small it is; but if it is yours
and you live according to it, it will go on growing.</p><p>Buddha says, “Be a light unto yourself.” That is his greatest
message. Nobody else in the whole world, in the whole history of
humanity, has been so respectful towards others as Gautam the Buddha.
“Be a light unto yourself.”</p><p>Buddhas only point the way – fingers pointing to the moon. You have
to follow, and you have to follow according to your nature. You have to
be silent, quiet, so you can listen to the still small voice within you,
and then follow it. Wherever it leads it is good. Go in deep trust,
following your own voice. Be spontaneous, natural, ordinary. This is the
way of being extraordinary. Be ordinary but aware, and the ordinary
becomes the sacred.</p><p>ALL THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE ARE IMPERMANENT...</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t be worried. All things are impermanent: pleasure and pain,
friendship and enmity, poverty and richness, success and failure, birth
and death. All is in a flux, all is impermanent, so why be worried?
Everything goes on changing. Don’t cling – clinging brings misery,
clinging shows your misunderstanding. The moment you cling to something
you are living with the idea that it can be permanent. Nothing can be
permanent, and nothing can be done about it. It is just the nature of
things to be impermanent.</p><p>You are trying to catch hold of rainbows. They are beautiful, but you
cannot catch hold of them – one moment they are there and another moment
they are gone. So don’t cling to anything because everything is
impermanent. And don’t desire anything because even if you get it, you
will lose it. If you don’t get it, you will be frustrated. If you get it
and lose it, you will be frustrated. Either way you will be in misery,
you are inviting misery. So don’t desire anything and don’t cling to
anything.</p><p>Whatsoever comes, accept it. Buddha calls it tathata, suchness. Just
accept it, live through it silently, without being disturbed by it.
Misery comes, it will go. Happiness comes, it will go. Everything passes
away, nothing abides, so there is nothing to worry about.</p><p>Go on passing through all kinds of experiences, and then you will
know that one can pass through the world uncontaminated, uncorrupted.
One can live in the palaces without clinging, then he is a sannyasin;
and one can live in a hut and can cling to the hut, then he is not a
sannyasin.</p><p>That’s why I don’t tell you to renounce the world, I simply say: Be
watchful. That is the essence of Buddha’s message.</p><p>People ask me, “But Buddha renounced the world. Why did he renounce?”
He renounced when he was not a Buddha. He renounced when he was as
ignorant as anybody else. He renounced in ignorance.</p><p>When he attained the truth, when he experienced the truth and came
back home, his wife asked him only one question. “Just tell me one
thing,” she asked. “Whatsoever you have attained... I can see you are a
transformed being. You have become luminous, you are no longer the same
person. The old is gone, you are reborn. It is so clear to me – even a
blind person like me can see it. But just answer me one question.
Whatsoever you have attained, was it not possible to attain it living
here with me in this palace?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the story is: Buddha remained silent, looking downwards. The wife
was right. He didn’t say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East, not saying anything is thought to be a sign of
agreement: MOUNAM SAMMATI LAKSHANAM. “To be silent means I agree with
you.” It says more than Buddha saying yes. His silence says more, it is
more pregnant with meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>He immediately felt it: “She is right.” Whatsoever he had attained
could have been attained anywhere. There was no need to go into the
jungle.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need for you to go anywhere. Wherever you are you can
assert your Buddhahood, you can become awakened.</p><p><br></p><p>The essence is to slip out of the mind, to get out of the mind. The
mind is the world. The mind is full of desires, full of clingings,
attachments, longings. Get out of the mind! Create a little distance
between you and the mind. Be a watcher, a watcher on the hills, and you
will be surprised: as you watch the mind, the distance becomes bigger
and bigger. As you watch the mind, as you become more and more
established in watching, the mind recedes farther and farther away. One
day it happens: you cannot hear the chatter of the mind; it is no longer
there. It is simply, absolutely silent. In that silence, truth descends
in you. In that silence, you encounter yourself, you encounter your
innermost core. And that is the innermost core of the whole existence.
Your being is the being of all.</p><p><br></p><p>We are separate as minds, as bodies, but not as consciousness. In
consciousness we meet, we are one. That consciousness is God. That
meeting, that oneness where all differences dissolve, where we are no
longer separate ice cubes, where we have melted and disappeared into the
universal, Buddha calls nirvana. The word is beautiful; it means
cessation of the ego. When the ego ceases you are God, you are a Buddha,
you are a Christ. It is the ego that is giving you a limitation. It is
the ego that is making you live in a prison. Get out of the ego! And
nobody is preventing you – it is your own clinging, it is your own
attachment. You have become too attached to your chains, you have become
too attached to your prison cell. You think it is your home, and it is
not. Come out of it! Wake up!</p><p><br></p><p>To be awake is to be a Buddha. And Yoka is right.</p><p><br></p><p>IF YOU REACH THE ZEN OF BUDDHA – the state of Buddha – AT THAT VERY
MOMENT YOU ACCOMPLISH EVERYTHING.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question Question 3</p><p>OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN YOU SPEAK OF RELIGIONS, YOU USUALLY MENTION CHRISTIANS,
MOHAMMEDANS AND HINDUS, BUT NOT JEWS. IS THERE A REASON FOR IT?</p><p><br></p><p>Veet Ateet,</p><p><br></p><p>THERE IS A REASON: I am the only Jew in India!</p><p><br></p><p>Once I was taken in a Cadillac car; the owner wanted to sell it. I
was interested – I have used all kinds of cars except the Cadillac. It
was a beautiful car, specially made. I loved it.</p><p><br></p><p>He asked me, “What do you say? How did you feel in it?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I felt just like a Jew! I will not purchase this car – this
will show my identity. I am already in more trouble than a man can
manage. Now to declare myself a Jew will be inviting even more trouble.
Jews are experts at inviting trouble!”</p><p><br></p><p>One old Jew was praying to God for years and never asking for
anything. God became fed up. If you ask for something, something can be
done and he can get rid of you! But he was not asking for anything; he
was just praying and praying and praying.</p><p><br></p><p>So one day God said, “Listen! What do you want? Why don’t you say
exactly what you want? I am ready to fulfil it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The old Jew said, “Is it true that we are your chosen people?” God
said, “Yes, that’s true.”</p><p>The Jew said, “Now please choose somebody else. For three thousand
years, just because of you, we have suffered so much. Enough is enough!
Now you choose somebody else!”</p><p><br></p><p>Veet Ateet, you must be a Jew also, otherwise why this question? Jews
are always thinking, in every possible way, about Jews.</p><p><br></p><p>The Friends of the Elephant Society – a society created to help sick,
old or homeless elephants – decided that although most people knew what
an elephant was, there had never been any serious, definitive study
conducted about the huge animal. They therefore decided to hold a
competition with a prize of a thousand dollars to be given for the best
book on the subject of the elephant.</p><p><br></p><p>An Englishman enters his book entitled: “The History and Statistics
of the Elephant.”</p><p><br></p><p>A German enters a three-volume set entitled: “The Anatomy and
Physiology of the Elephant.”</p><p><br></p><p>A Frenchman enters a slim, hundred-page volume entitled: “The Amorous
Affairs of the Elephant.”</p><p><br></p><p>An Italian seriously considers the project for about five minutes,
then drops it and joins his friends for some spaghetti.</p><p>And a Jew enters an epic effort entitled: “The Elephant and the
Jewish Problem.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, Ateet, why does this question come to your mind? I don’t say
much about Judaism because in India there are no Jews. Hindus are there,
Christians are there, Mohammedans are there, Jainas are there, Buddhists
are there; only Jews are missing, so I don’t mention them much. Of
course, Jews are not missing here. This must be the only place in the
whole of India where you can find thousands of Jews – but they are no
longer Jews.</p><p><br></p><p>Ateet, this must be a hangover with you. Do you know what your name
means? Veet Ateet means going beyond the past. You still seem to have a
hangover of being Jewish. And having thousands of Jews here, it is
better not to talk about them because they are very argumentative
people.</p><p><br></p><p>A Christian visiting the Holy Land struck up a conversation with an
Israeli. “I am really surprised that you and the Arabs can’t get
together peacefully.”</p><p>“My dear man,” said the Israeli, “the Jews are a very argumentative
people. The only thing you can get two Jews to agree upon is what a
third Jew should give to charity.”</p><p><br></p><p>That is true.</p><p><br></p><p>Jimmy finally got Sadat and Begin together for a resumption of the
Mid-East peace talks.</p><p><br></p><p>Afterwards Sadat said, “I’m glad we buried the hatchet. In the future
I wish you everything you wish me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Begin answered, “See, you’re starting up again.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why, Ateet, I don’t mention Jews very much. It is dangerous!
Surrounded by thousands of Jews it is better not to mention Jews at
all.</p><p><br></p><p>And, moreover, Judaism is a dead religion, just as Hinduism is. In
fact, there have been only two source religions in the world: Hinduism
and Judaism. Both are dead. Jainism and Buddhism are offshoots of
Hinduism but because the root is dead the branches are dead too. And
Christianity and Islam are branches of Judaism, and because the root is
dead the branches are dead too. These are dead phenomena. I am not much
concerned with the past.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, something beautiful has happened in Judaism, too, and that is
Hassidism – and I have talked about it a lot. Just as I love Zen people
in the tradition of the Buddha, I love Hassids in the tradition of Moses
and I love Sufis in the tradition of Mohammed. These three are still
alive in some small way because these three have never become
established religions; they have always been anti- establishment, they
have always been alternatives to the established religion, they have
always been rebellious.</p><p><br></p><p>Hassidism is worth talking about, not Judaism – and I have talked
about Hassidism. I have been approaching Hassidism with my own
experience. I have been bringing Hassidism up to date, trying to make it
part of the twentieth century. Hassidism is the essence of Judaism, the
very fragrance of it.</p><p>And I have something of the Hassids in me, that’s why I sometimes
call myself a Jew. The Hassids love life, they are life-affirmative.
They don’t believe in renunciation, they believe in rejoicing. They
believe in dancing, singing, celebrating – and that’s exactly my
approach too.</p><p><br></p><p>My religion is something of a meeting of Zen, Sufism and Hassidism –
and something more thrown in.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question Question 4</p><p>OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>ACTUALLY, I LOVE TO PHILOSOPHIZE. WHAT TO DO WITH THAT ABILITY IN A
PLACE LIKE THIS?</p><p><br></p><p>Deva Anurati,</p><p><br></p><p>PHILOSOPHY IS A SHEER WASTE of your energy. The same energy can
become your meditation, the same energy can become your awakening.
Philosophy is like dreaming: you can dream beautiful dreams, but
dreaming is dreaming. You can think of God, but to think of God is not
to know God. To know about God is not to know God. The word “about”
means around. You can go on around and around... you will be moving in a
circle and you will never reach the target, because the target is the
center not the circumference.</p><p><br></p><p>Philosophy is circumferential, peripheral. It can deceive you; it has
deceived millions of people because it talks about love, about God, it
even talks about meditation. It philosophizes about everything.</p><p><br></p><p>But philosophy means that your mind remains your master; it is mind
that philosophizes. You have to go beyond mind, Anurati – and it is not
going to happen through philosophy. It can happen only through
meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Now you must be philosophizing about meditation: what it is, how to
define it. There are thousands of definitions and you can be lost in the
jungle of definitions.</p><p><br></p><p>And I can understand your difficulty. You must be feeling a little
out of place, because here philosophy is debarred. I am creating a
non-philosophical atmosphere. The whole effort here is to help you go
beyond mind. I don’t want you to think about love, I want you to love. I
don’t want you to think about God, I want you to KNOW God, to BE
God.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the point when you are thirsty to go on thinking about water?
Even if you discover by your thinking that water consists of H20, that
is not going to quench your thirst. And that’s what philosophy is: H20.
You are thirsty, and philosophy says, “Don’t be thirsty. Water is simply
H20. Just write H20 on the paper and eat the paper!”</p><p><br></p><p>Philosophers go on eating the papers. They eat great things:
Upanishads, Vedas, Korans, Bibles. They have a great appetite for paper!
That’s why there is such a shortage of paper in the world: there are so
many paper-eaters. Crazy people!</p><p>Yes, once in a while philosophy may be good, just for a change.</p><p><br></p><p>Molly Landau was learning to drive a car. Regrettably, as it turned
out, she thought she already knew how so she dismissed her driving
instructor and ventured forth upon the public highway, unaccompanied by
either an experienced hand or a driver’s license.</p><p><br></p><p>As she wobbled in an uncertain course along Southern Boulevard in the
Bronx, a milkman driving a well-behaved horse turned a corner. Mrs
Landau tried simultaneously to do several things: apply the brakes,
avoid a collision, turn out, turn in, veer left, veer right, speed up,
slow down, and who knows what else.</p><p><br></p><p>The “what else” was that she banged squarely into the side of the
milk-wagon, leaving it turned over on its side in the middle of the
street, with the horse and driver entangled in the wreckage.</p><p><br></p><p>The lady, losing her head, at the same time lost control of the car.
She sped away, swerved out of sight and on squealing tires she circled
the block. A minute later she reappeared at the scene of the accident,
still wrestling with the steering wheel. The dairyman, who had managed
to extricate himself from the mess, was cutting his struggling horse
loose from the twisted harness when he heard the clatter and roar of an
approaching, wide-open engine. He looked up to see the same car and the
same woman again bearing down on him. Just in time to save himself, he
jumped aside.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a second crash and once more the green motorist proceeded
on her devastating way. But now the capsized wagon was a total loss. The
milkman was a natural-born philosopher. As he stood in the midst of the
ruins, he shrugged his shoulders and remarked to the curious citizens
who had gathered around, “About that lady’s driving, I can’t say she’s
an expert. But you have to give her credit – she’s thorough!”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, in such situations, a little philosophy is good: it helps you to
keep cool. But more than that it is of no use, Anurati. You will have to
learn a new way of being. If you are here – and you are here – stop
philosophizing. Start experiencing, because it is only through
experience that one comes to know the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth is not a conclusion arrived at by logical argumentation, truth
is not arrived at through syllogism, truth is an experience of a silent,
still consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Learn to be more silent and still.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the first question from Anurati that I am answering. She must
have asked hundreds of questions – I go on throwing them away. The
moment I see Anurati’s name, the question goes into the wastepaper
basket for the simple reason that I don’t want to nourish her
philosophical mind. If I start talking about her philosophical problems
she will get more and more into them.</p><p><br></p><p>She goes on asking me, “You answer everybody’s question. Why don’t
you answer my question?” So today I decided that at least one question
should be answered.</p><p><br></p><p>Philosophy is a disease – and I know it first-hand! I have been a
professor of philosophy – you can trust me! I have suffered from it and
I know it is very chronic. Once it enters into your system it is</p><p>very difficult to throw it out. I have every sympathy for Anurati,
but if the right effort is made you can get rid of it; it is not
incurable. And because it never gives you anything... It promises much,
but it never supplies any goods.</p><p><br></p><p>Just look back. What has it given to you? It makes people great
bullshitters, that’s all! They go on talking about great things they
know nothing of. It may give you a very polished ego, but this is the
problem that has to be solved, it is not the solution.</p><p><br></p><p>Anurati, wake up from your philosophical dream! Howsoever sweet it
is, it is a dream. And it is so useless that you can always find an
argument for anything. Philosophy is a prostitute: it can go with
anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditate on Murphy’s maxim: To every Ph.D. there is an equal and
opposite Ph.D.</p><p><br></p><p>You can argue for, you can argue against. Philosophy has no anchor.
It is a game, like chess: it keeps you occupied and gives you a sense of
doing something great. But remember, it is all dreaming.</p><p><br></p><p>One night Zorba the Greek dreamed that he had to leave his island. So
he went down to the port and stepped aboard a boat.</p><p><br></p><p>The captain stopped him and said, “You’ll have to pay one hundred
drachmas.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s sheer robbery!” exclaimed Zorba. “I won’t give you more than
fifty drachmas.” “One hundred or you will have to swim!”</p><p>“Is that so?” Zorba said. “You better take me for fifty drachmas or
I’ll wake up and you’ll lose everything!”</p><p><br></p><p>Anurati, please wake up! But people are afraid to wake up. The fear
is they will lose everything because all that they have is nothing but
dream stuff. Their philosophy is their dream, their religion is their
dream, their knowledge is their dream, their ego is their dream. In
their dream they have gathered many things, hence they are afraid to
wake up, because the moment they wake up all is lost.</p><p><br></p><p>One night Mulla Nasruddin dreamed that a man wanted to give him some
money. He was very generous, but Mulla was insistent, “Give me a hundred
rupees.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the man was saying, “Take ninety... ninety-one... ninety-two...
ninety-three.”</p><p><br></p><p>But Mulla was insistent on a hundred rupees because Mulla could see
that the man was so generous, he looked so kind that he might agree on a
hundred rupees, so why settle for less?</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “Listen. For the last time, take ninety-nine.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla said, “One hundred!” But he said it so loudly that he woke up.
He opened his eyes – the man had disappeared and the money had
disappeared.</p><p>He immediately closed his eyes and he said, “Okay, okay. Give me
ninety-nine!” But now there was nobody there. He said, “Don’t be so
angry. Ninety-eight... ninety-seven...” But there was nobody there at
all. It was all a dream.</p><p><br></p><p>You are dreaming beautiful dreams. Philosophy is a very clever
dream.</p><p><br></p><p>Anurati, get out of it! And this is not the place to philosophize;
you can do it anywhere else. Such stupid things can be done anywhere.
For such stupid things you need not come from America to India! Do
something real, do something authentic. Do something that will transform
your life, that will give you a new birth.</p><p><br></p><p>“Unless you are born again you cannot enter into my kingdom of God.”
The fifth question</p><p>Question 5 OSHO,</p><p>I HAVE TRAVELED ALL OVER INDIA, BUT I HAVE NEVER HEARD AN ILL WORD
SPOKEN OF THIS TOWN, POONA.</p><p><br></p><p>Naresh,</p><p><br></p><p>PERHAPS IT IS because one should not speak ill of the dead! The sixth
question</p><p>Question 6</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, WHY ARE YOU AGAINST THE GREEKS? WHY DO YOU CALL THEM THE
“GODDAMNED GREEKS”?</p><p><br></p><p>Veera,</p><p><br></p><p>THE GREEKS ARE GREAT PEOPLE – I love them. I love Socrates, I love
Pythagoras, I love Heraclitus – and, of course, I love Mukta. But they
are “goddamned.”</p><p><br></p><p>A Russian can be cheated only by a gipsy, a gipsy by Jew, a Jew by a
Greek, and a Greek only by the devil.</p><p><br></p><p>The seventh question Question 7</p><p>OSHO, I AM BRITISH. ANYTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT?</p><p><br></p><p>Mark,</p><p>THIS TIME IT IS TOO LATE. Next time be a little more careful in
choosing your parents! The eighth question</p><p>Question 8</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, CAN CHILDREN UNDERSTAND THE TRUTH? RAJ,</p><p>CHILDREN CAN UNDERSTAND THE TRUTH but cannot understand that they
understand it. They understand more clearly than you can understand
because they are more clean, more innocent; but they are so innocent
that they cannot understand that they understand.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence you need another childhood, a second childhood. First you have
to lose your first childhood. That is the whole meaning of the biblical
story of Adam and Eve losing paradise: that is losing the first
childhood. It is a tremendously significant story. It has so many
meanings, it is such a multi-dimensional parable, that I don’t think
there exists any other parable comparable to it.</p><p><br></p><p>You can look at it from many aspects. It is losing the first
childhood – which is inevitable. Adam and Eve are not committing a sin.
In fact, the word “sin” comes from a root which means forgetting, and
that is a beautiful meaning: they are simply forgetting something.</p><p><br></p><p>Every child has to forget his innocence. Every child has to get lost
in the world. Every child has to go astray has to make many many
mistakes, has to suffer, has to pass through pain and pleasure and all
kinds of dualities so that one day he can again start feeling a great
longing to go back home. Lost in the deserts of the world, a longing
arises one day to go back home.</p><p><br></p><p>That longing is sannyas, that longing is religion. And then one
consciously comes back again to one’s childhood; this is the second
childhood. Now one understands and also understands that one
understands. The first childhood is very innocent; it is bound to be
lost because it is a natural gift, God’s gift. The second childhood is
never lost because it is your earning, you have become worthy of it. It
is no longer a gift; you deserve it. It is growth, not a gift. It is
your maturity.</p><p><br></p><p>Adam and Eve lose their first childhood, and it is in people like
Buddha and Jesus Christ and Zarathustra and Moses that the second
childhood happens. In Christ, Adam starts moving back towards paradise.
If Adam is the going away from paradise, Jesus is the coming back
home.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you watch children you will see how clear they are about
things – far more clear than you are. You are very much confused; you
have so many thoughts to confuse you. Children are not confused – they
don’t have any thoughts to confuse them. Their flames are burning bright
with no smoke. They are full of wonder and awe, and the moment they see
something they immediately understand, because there is no barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>If we can help children to be meditative we can change the whole
world – its energy, its consciousness. But we teach them something else,
never meditation – geography, history, and all kinds of nonsense which
is absolutely useless. Now, what does it matter where Timbuktoo is?
1</p><p>don’t know; I simply love the name Timbuktoo – wherever it is! But
children are being taught about stupid kings – Genghis Khan and Nadir
Shah and Tamburlaine. For what? Why are you filling their heads with
rubbish?</p><p><br></p><p>This is the moment to make them aware because they are naturally
aware. If we help them to understand their awareness and their
innocence, the first childhood can become a movement into the second
childhood.</p><p><br></p><p>A French farmer’s son missed a day in school and explained to the
teacher that he was absent because of important family business.</p><p><br></p><p>“I had to take the bull to the cows,” he explained.</p><p><br></p><p>“But couldn’t your father do that better?” the teacher wanted to
know.</p><p><br></p><p>“I suppose my father is a pretty good lover,” the French lad said,
“but in this case I think the bull does it better.”</p><p><br></p><p>They are more clear about things than your so-called knowledgeable
people.</p><p><br></p><p>California is full of crazies. Even the doctors are crazy. A troubled
young lady went to consult an M.D., complaining that she was having
trouble with her menstrual cycle.</p><p><br></p><p>“No problem, chick,” said the medico.’Why don’t you just trade it in
for a Honda?” During a visit to the zoo a youngster asked his mother,
“Mom, how do lions screw?” She replied, “I really don’t know, dear, most
of your father’s friends are Rotarians.”</p><p>“My new husband is a sex maniac,” complained the young lady to the
judge. “Ever since the honeymoon he has been making non-stop love to me.
I can’t get no rest day or night. I want a divorce.”</p><p><br></p><p>“All right,” said the judge, “but first you’ll have to file your
application.”</p><p><br></p><p>“File my application!” exclaimed the lady indignantly. “Why, that
poor thing is so sore I can’t even bear to touch it!”</p><p><br></p><p>A schoolteacher bent too low over her desk to mark a paper and little
Johnny in the front seat said, “Teacher, I see something.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s very rude, Johnny. Tomorrow don’t come to school,” the
teacher admonished.</p><p><br></p><p>A week later, the teacher bent down to pick up a piece of chalk.
Johnny, still in a ringside seat, got up and started to walk to the
door. “Where are you going?” asked the teacher sternly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Teacher, my schooldays are over.”</p><p>Children see very clearly; their eyes are transparent. But soon they
have to lose their innocence. We force them to lose it. We fill their
heads with such rubbish that their eyes stop seeing. Every parent is
trying, every society is trying, every church is trying to fill the
child’s mind with stupid things before he starts becoming aware on his
own; otherwise he will be a rebel. So by the time you are three or four
years old, things have already started being poured into you. You are
sent to the church, you are being taught religion – as if religion can
be taught.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion cannot be taught, it can only be caught. You can catch it
only when you are in the company of a man like Jesus or Buddha. When you
are in the company of a man like Yoka, Rinzai, Bodhidharma, you can
catch it; it is infectious. But it cannot be taught. A religion that is
taught – it is rubbish. But we are very interested in making our
children Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan as soon as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>In a better world, in a more human world, at least up to the age of
twenty-one, children should not be taught any Christianity, Hinduism,
Jainism, Judaism, no. Up to the age of twenty-one – when they become
capable of voting – they should be left to inquire on their own. And I
assure you, Christianity, Jainism, Buddhism, Judaism, Mohammedanism,
will all disappear from the world. Just leave children to themselves up
to their twenty-first year and then try to teach them Christianity! They
will raise such questions that even you will start suspecting whether
Christianity is of any worth. But you force poor children three years of
age... They cannot resist, they cannot protect themselves. They depend
on you for their survival, so you can do anything.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the greatest crime that can be done to children. Parents
have been criminals throughout the whole past, and the greatest crime is
that you condition your children’s minds and you don’t allow them the
freedom to seek and search and inquire for themselves. Of course,
parents have not done it knowingly; their parents had conditioned them
and they were simply repeating a pattern. And they were thinking that
they were doing it for your own good. In fact, the greatest crimes have
been committed for your own good. Whenever somebody says, “I am doing it
for your own good,” beware, because nobody needs to do anything for your
own good.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, parents need to feed you, to clothe you, to support you, to make
you strong in body, to support you in your inquiry, in your questioning,
to give you every kind of support and protection so that you can freely
inquire. The whole world will be full of agnostics, inquirers, and that
will be the beginning of a true religion on the earth. And it has to
happen from the very childhood because it is such a stupid waste of time
to first destroy their minds, because then it becomes very hard, very
difficult to uncondition them. They start resisting because then they
start getting identified with their own minds.</p><p><br></p><p>Every day I receive questions – rude questions, ugly questions –
because whenever somebody feels hurt, immediately his conditioned mind
reacts and he writes something in anger.</p><p><br></p><p>I am trying to help you to be on your own, to be free, and you get
angry because you don’t want to be free. You have become accustomed to
being slaves. But you don’t think it is slavery; you think it is
knowledge, it is wisdom. You think you know the Bible, you know the
Gita, you know the Koran. And when I go on destroying, negating, you
become scared. If all your knowledge is taken away, what is left? You
are very afraid of nothingness – and that is the true beginning, that is
the beginning of a new birth.</p><p>Everybody has to become again a nothing, again a child, again
innocent; only then will you be able to understand truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Children are capable of understanding it, but they are not capable of
understanding that they understand it. For that you have to wait a
little. But we can prepare the children. We can use their capacity to
understand to make them more free, to make them more adventurous, to
make them more courageous.</p><p><br></p><p>If you really love your children you will help them to go on an
adventure so that they can find God by themselves. It is beautiful to
find truth; it is ugly to carry somebody else’s truth on your shoulders.
It is simply a dead weight. It cripples, kills; it poisons you.</p><p><br></p><p>The last question Question 9</p><p>OSHO, THERE’S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT, SARJANO IS MY LSD: A
LATIN-SEDUCING-DON JUAN. THE ASHRAM SEEMS TO BE THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT
AND I KNOW YOU ARE GUIDING ME THROUGH THE TRIP, BUT WHAT’S THE RIGHT
DOSE TO TAKE HIM IN?</p><p><br></p><p>Satya Bharti,</p><p><br></p><p>SARJANO IS a ladies’ man, so don’t waste your time in thinking about
the right dose to take him in because tomorrow he may not be available.
Eat him totally if you can! There is just one thing you have to be aware
of: if you don’t like spaghetti, then eating him is going to be a
torture – it will be all spaghetti!</p><p><br></p><p>What did the cannibal say after he ate the Italian? “The meat’s a
little on the greasy side.”</p><p><br></p><p>So eat him while he is available and don’t waste time in thinking
about right proportions – how much and how much not.</p><p><br></p><p>Sarjano is like the wind: today he is here, tomorrow somewhere else.
And remember perfectly well: eat him before he eats you, because these
Italians are really dangerous people!</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day there was a question: “What is more dangerous than
an Italian?” Of course, two Italians!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

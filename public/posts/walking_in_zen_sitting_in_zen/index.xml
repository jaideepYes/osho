‌CHAPTER 1
The Breath of the Soul
5 March 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
WHY HAVE YOU CALLED THIS SERIES OF DISCOURSES: “WALKING IN ZEN, SITTING IN ZEN”?
I AM NOT TO BLAME. The whole blame goes to this old guy Yoka. Yoka is one of the rarest enlightened people; his sayings are tremendously beautiful. Very few sayings are available, but each saying is a diamond unique in itself.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
The Garden Of Tathagata
4 May 1980 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
OSHO, WHAT IS THE GOAL OF MEDITATION?
Prageeta,
THERE IS NO GOAL OF MEDITATION. Meditation is the dropping of all goals, hence it can’t have a goal of its own; that would be against its very nature. Goals exist in the future; meditation is to be in the present.</description>

‌CHAPTER 11
The Law Of Grace
5 May 1980 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
OSHO, WHAT IS THE MEANING OF EXISTENCE?
Pravino,
MEANING IS A HUMAN INVENTION. There is no meaning in existence itself, it is beyond meaning. It is not meaningless either because a thing can be meaningless only if it is possible for it to have meaning. Meaning and meaninglessness are two sides of the same coin.</description>

‌CHAPTER 12
The Heart Always Knows
6 May 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO, THE BUDDHA SAID, “IF YOU WANT TO SEE, SEE AT ONCE. DON’T LET THE MIND ENTER INTO IT.” CAN YOU TELL US MORE ABOUT “SEEING”?
Anand Deepesh,
SEEING IS A STATE OF NO-MIND a state of no-thought, a state of pure awareness, when you simply reflect that which is without any interference, any judgment, any like, any dislike; when you don’t say a thing about it, you just function like a mirror.</description>

‌CHAPTER 13
Light In The Seed
7 May 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO, HOW CAN I BECOME A LIGHT UNTO MYSELF?
Shraddho Yannis,
THESE WERE THE LAST WORDS of Gautam the Buddha, his parting message to his disciples: “Be a light unto yourself.” But when he says, “Be a light unto yourself,” he does not mean become a light unto yourself.</description>

‌CHAPTER 14
Don’t Abandon Existence
8 May 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO, IS IT NOT NECESSARY TO DESIRE, TO LONG AND TO SEEK TRUTH AND AVOID THE UNTRUE, TO SEEK TRUTH AND RENOUNCE THE FALSE?
Divyananda,
THERE IS NO WAY TO SEEK TRUTH because truth is not far away. Truth is not “there” somewhere so that you have to go to it, so that you have to reach to it; truth is not to be sought because truth is the very being of the seeker.</description>

‌CHAPTER 15
So Lost And So At Home
9 May 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO, HOW DOES IT HAPPEN THAT I FEEL SO AT HOME AND SO LOST IN THIS BUDDHAFIELD?
Deva Kamma,
THERE IS NO CONTRADICTION IN IT; it is as it should be. To be lost, utterly lost, is to be at home. Man ordinarily lives as an ego, separate from the whole, like an island, with a definite identity – the name, the form; he is somebody.</description>

‌CHAPTER 16
All Moons In The One Moon
10 May 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO, I CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE PHILOSOPHY OF ZEN. WHAT SHOULD I DO TO UNDERSTAND IT?
Baula,
ZEN IS NOT A PHILOSOPHY AT ALL. To approach Zen as if it were a philosophy is to start in a wrong way from the very beginning. A philosophy is something of the mind; Zen is totally beyond the mind.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
This Is Sacred, This Is Divine
6 March 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO, WHAT IS ZEN?
Sagar,
IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO ANSWER because Zen is not a philosophy, it is not a doctrine. It is an experience, an experience of your own interiority, of your own subjectivity – not an objective experience. If it were some object outside you, there would be a possibility of describing it, of analyzing it, of defining it.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
... And Something More
7 March 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO, YOU SAY: GO BEYOND THE MIND. DO NOT LISTEN TO ITS CHATTER. DISCIPLINE IT AND MAKE IT A SERVANT. DO NOT BE ITS SLAVE. BUT HOW TO KNOW WHEN THE MIND IS BEING DISCIPLINED AND WHEN IT IS BEING REPRESSED? ALSO, WHEN I TOOK SANNYAS THE OTHER NIGHT YOU SAID NOT TO GET HOOKED ON YOU.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
A Question Of Being
8 March 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO, THE VISION “NEITHER THIS NOR THAT” FEELS SO NEGATIVE. HOW CAN I BE ACCEPTING OR EVEN CREATIVE WITH THIS? I FEEL TOTALLY CONFUSED.
Prem Helmut,
MIND LIVES IN THE DUALITY of the positive and the negative. It lives like a pendulum, moving from yes to no, from no to yes.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
Playing On The Path
9 March 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO, IT FEELS THAT TO BE A WITNESS IS ALSO A KIND OF THOUGHT. SO WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WITNESS AND A THOUGHT OF THE WITNESS?
Satyendra Saraswati,
WITNESSING IS NOT A THOUGHT but you can start thinking about witnessing, you can make it a thought.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
Absolute Love In Absolute Freedom
10 March 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO, WHY DO I WANT TO WAKE UP WHEN, AS YOU SAY, AWAKENING ONLY HAPPENS WHEN I AM NOT? THIS SEEMS VERY PARADOXICAL.
Deva Satyarthi,
THE EGO IS NOT YOUR REAL SELF; the ego is a false entity, arbitrary. It is the ego that is your sleep, that surrounds you like a darkness, like a cloud.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
Better Mad Than Stupid
1 May 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LONGING FOR THE DIVINE AND LOVING ANOTHER?
Prem Neeto,
THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL – all desires are the same. You can desire money, you can desire meditation, you can long for power, you can long for God, but you remain the same.</description>

Prem Sanatana,
THERE HAVE BEEN TWO KINDS OF MASTERS in the world.</description>

To Enjoy Life Is Bliss
3 May 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO, I HAVE BEEN HERE NOW FOR ALMOST TWO AND A HALF YEARS, BUT I STILL FEEL THAT SOMETHING IN MY LIFE GOES BASICALLY WRONG. EXCEPT FOR SHORT GLIMPSES, I AM UNABLE TO FIND ANY LASTING MEANING IN IT. MOST OF THE TIME I’M HANGING IN A BOTTOMLESS, QUITE FRIGHTENING, UNCOMFORTABLE “NOWHERE.</description>

HOW CAN I BE ACCEPTING OR EVEN CREATIVE WITH THIS? I FEEL TOTALLY CONFUSED.\nPrem Helmut,\nMIND LIVES IN THE DUALITY of the positive and the negative. It lives like a pendulum, moving from yes to no, from no to yes. It cannot live in the absolute yes, it cannot live in the absolute no. Absolute yes means now there is no possibility for the pendulum to move anywhere. Absolute no also means the same: no space for the mind to play games. Anything absolute is a death for the mind.\nThere are two possibilities of killing the mind, of transcending the mind: either absolute yes or absolute no. The Upanishads have used the first possibility, absolute yes, and Buddha has used the second possibility, absolute no. But look deeply and you will find they are not different, they are bridged by the same phenomenon - absoluteness. Anything absolute becomes the grave of the mind; it needs duality to exist.\nThat’s why you are so afraid of the absolute negative, because in the absolute you start disappearing. You are your mind. Of course, there is something more in you than your mind, but\nyou are not aware of it. And as you start disappearing, fear arises, confusion arises; one is scared, one wants to cling to whatsoever is available to cling to.\nIt is because of this miracle of the absolute that God has been synonymous with the absolute. God means the absolute. Either say absolute yes and your mind disappears, or say absolute no and your mind disappears.\nWhy has Buddha chosen to say absolute no, why not absolute yes? For a certain reason: with the absolute yes there is one danger. The danger is that you may not understand the absoluteness of the yes; you may still go on thinking that it is your old positivity. With the absolute no that danger is not possible. With the absolute no, death seems so clear that you cannot miss it - hence the confusion.\nThis confusion is good. Don’t try to escape from it, go deeper into it. Soon it will become a chaos\n- not just confusion but chaos. When all that you have known about yourself is shattered, when all that you have believed in has evaporated, when all that you were identified with has slipped out of your hands - the very earth beneath you is no longer available, you are falling and falling into a bottomless abyss - that is chaos. And only out of chaos are stars born. Out of chaos is creativity.\nYou ask: How can I be accepting or even creative with this?\nThere is no question of accepting because every acceptance means that deep down there is rejection. Otherwise, why the question of acceptance? Why in the first place do you think of accepting? You must be rejecting somewhere.\nI don’t accept life because I don’t reject it in the first place. It is simply there, neither rejected nor accepted. It is so. Buddha calls it tathata, suchness.\nA man came to Buddha and asked, “What should we do with death? Should we accept it?”\nBuddha said, “There is no question of accepting or rejecting. Death is! It is so. Such is the nature of things: they are born one day, one day they die.”\nWhy do you think of rejecting or accepting? If you try to accept, that simply means a kind of repression. First you must have rejected; you must be still rejecting and you are covering up your rejection with acceptance. Deep down you are angry and on the surface you are smiling, you are all smiles. Deep down you are sad; on the surface you are laughing and trying to hide the fact not only from others but from yourself too.\nFriedrich Nietzsche has said, “I laugh because I am afraid that if I don’t laugh I will start crying and weeping. I go on laughing just to avoid the possibility of crying and weeping. I don’t want to cry and weep. I want to forget that there are tears in me.”\nBut this is just a cover-up; this laughter is not true. This is not the laughter of the Buddhas - it can’t be. It is the desperate effort of a split mind. This is schizophrenia: one part wants to cry, another part is trying to hide it. You are in conflict. But we are brought up in conflict, we have learned how to live in conflict - this has become our very life style. It is not a question of accepting.\nTrue acceptance is not an acceptance at all. You will be surprised by my statement: true acceptance is not an acceptance at all. True acceptance is absence of rejection and acceptance. One simply knows that this is how things are - the suchness of things, tathata.\nHence one of the beautiful names of Buddha: Tathagata. The Buddhist scriptures always use the word tathagata for Buddha: one who lives in suchness, neither rejecting nor accepting, simply seeing whatsoever is the case, only reflecting.\nAnd you ask me: How is creativity possible out of this absolute negativity? You don’t know anything about creativity. Creativity comes only out of total negation, it comes out of absolute emptiness. The whole world has come out of nothingness and the whole world will one day move into nothingness.\nNow the scientists have stumbled upon one of the most important discoveries ever: the discovery of the black hole. They say there are a few spots in existence, which can be called black holes, where if anything comes close it is sucked in by the black hole and it disappears, it becomes nothing.\nBut this is only half the story; the other half has still to be discovered. I can predict it will be discovered soon: the white hole, the other side of the black hole, from which things start coming out of nothingness. Existence goes into rest, then nothingness prevails. When the rest is over, existence again becomes active, manifest; then creativity prevails. Creativity comes out of nothingness.\nThe more you are a nobody, the more you know that there is no ego in you, the more creativity will flow through you. You will become a vehicle, you will become a passage. Songs will pour out of you - and music and love and joy. And whatsoever you touch will be transformed into gold, and whatsoever you say will have something poetic in it, and whatsoever you do will have grace, will have something divine about it, something sacred and holy.\nCreativity is nothing that you have to do; you are the barrier - it is because of you that creativity is prevented. Make way. Don’t stand in between. Move yourself away and let your void, your inner void, face existence. And the inner void will reflect the existence and, out of that reflection, creativity is born.\nBut I am not talking about ordinary creativity: that you compose a poem or you paint a small painting or you sculpt. These things can be done without being creative; all that you need to know is the art, the technique of doing them. Out of one hundred so-called creators it is very rare to find even one or two who are real creators; ninety-nine percent are only composers, not creators. They know how to put words together, they are clever, they are cunning, they are crafty; what they are doing is not creativity. They are putting things together - maybe in new arrangements, but there is nothing original.\nThe original always comes from an egoless state, it always comes when you are absent. When you are absent, consciousness is present, God is present. And then something miraculous starts happening, not by you but through you. It gives you a great feeling of humbleness and gratitude.\nSo don’t be worried about absolute negativity; that is one of the most beautiful spaces to be in. One can be in that space through absolute positivity also, but there is a danger: your mind can play tricks with the absolute positive. But it cannot play tricks with the absolute negative. With the absolute positive it can still hope to remain in some way or other; the positive seems to be sheltering, safe.\nHence, except with Gautam the Buddha, every other religion has used the positive. It is only Buddha who has used the negative. But you must know that more people have become enlightened through Gautam Buddha’s approach than through all the other approaches put together for the simple reason that with the absolute negative there is no safety, no shelter at all for the mind, for the ego. It is total death.\nThat’s why you are confused. I am happy that you are confused. I will be more happy if your confusion becomes a chaos. I will be still more happy if you disappear into a black hole, because then the only thing possible is that you will come out of a white hole. You will be resurrected.\nCrucifixion is the way of resurrection. Death is the way of being reborn. The second question\nQuestion 2 OSHO,\nWHAT IS SATORI AND HOW TO ATTAIN IT?\nPratima,\nSATORI IS EXACTLY YOUR ORDINARY NATURE; it is not anything special. Hence there is no question of attaining it - it is already the case. You are in it, you have just forgotten. You have become too occupied with the outside world. You have forgotten your own kingdom, you have forgotten your own treasure, you have forgotten yourself. You have become too concerned with others. You are too much in the world and you don’t give any time, any space for your inner nature to have a dialogue with you, to whisper a few things to you. You have become artificial.\nYou have created a false ego because nobody can live without a center. You have forgotten your real center, and nobody can live without a center, so you have created a false center as a substitute. That’s the ego. Ego simply means living with a false center.\nSatori is dropping the false, entering into the real; just being yourself, your natural self, your ordinary self.\nThe word “ordinary” has to be remembered because the mind is not interested in the ordinary at all; it wants to be extraordinary, it wants to be special. It is through being special that the ego survives. It is constantly striving to be more special, more special. It wants to be more rich, more powerful, more respectable; it is ambitious. Hence the word “ordinary” has no appeal for the mind. And that is the beauty of the word “ordinary” - because it has no appeal for the mind.\nMind is an achiever and the ordinary need not be achieved; it is already the case. The extraordinary has to be achieved, the extraordinary becomes the goal. It is far away; you have to make all kinds of efforts, you have to struggle for it, you have to fight for it because there are so many competitors.\nTo be ordinary... and there is no competition at all. You can just be ordinary, nobody has any objection. People will simply feel sorry for you that you have dropped out of the competitive race.\nOne competitor less - they will feel good but sorry for you. They will say, “Poor fellow! What happened to him? Why did he have to drop out?” The dropouts are not respectable people.\nBuddha is a dropout. All real Masters are dropouts. To be a sannyasin means to be a dropout. To drop out of the rat race is to drop in, because when you are in the race you cannot enter in. When you are no longer in the race there is nowhere to go. You start moving inwards because life is a flow: if there is no outer direction it takes the inner direction. If the goal is not there far away in the future, then you start moving into your nature in the present. That is satori.\nSatori is very ordinary. Satori means your nature. You have come with it; it is your original face - all other faces are masks.\nYOKA SAYS:\nA DISCIPLE SPEAKS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ULTIMATE, THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH. REMEMBER THAT ONE SHOULD CUT THE ROOT AND NOT THE BRANCHES AND THE LEAVES.\nWhat is the root of your misery? The root is your ambition, desiring. One wants to be this and that, one wants to possess this and that, one wants to be somebody, one wants to be significant.\nYoka says: Cut the root... only then are you a disciple. And the moment you cut the root - not the branches, not the leaves - you attain the ultimate truth. The ultimate truth is not far away; it is the immediate truth, it is your truth, it is your very being.\nMost people do not recognize the perfect jewel, the jewel of supreme wisdom, satori. It is hidden in the secret place of Tathagata, awaiting its discovery.\nIt is to live in your suchness; it is hidden in your suchness. Whatsoever you are, live in it. Don’t create any conflict, don’t live through the ideal. Don’t be an idealist, just be natural.\nBut everybody is being taught to be an idealist: “Become a Jesus” or “Become a Buddha” or “Become a Krishna.” Nobody tells you just to be yourself! Why should you be a Jesus? One Jesus is enough and one Jesus is beautiful - he enriches the existence. Many Jesuses just carrying crosses, and wherever you go you meet them... It won’t look beautiful, it won’t add to the beauty of existence; it will make the whole world ugly. Wherever you go you meet a Mahavira standing naked.…\nIt is because of this that God never creates the same person again. He never repeats; he is original. He always creates a new person. You have never been before, and there is no one who is like you, and there will never be anybody else like you again. In the whole of eternity you alone are just like you. Look at the beauty of it and the glory of it and the respect that God has shown to you! What more respectability do you need? See the uniqueness of yourself. There is no need to be unique; you are already unique, just as everybody else is unique. You are unique in your ordinariness, in your suchness.\nSATORI IS HIDDEN, SAYS YOKA, IN THE SECRET PLACE OF YOUR SUCHNESS, AWAITING ITS DISCOVERY.\nIt has not to be created, it is already there; you just have to discover it. Go in and discover it! It is waiting and waiting. And centuries have passed and many many lives have passed, and you have become addicted to extroversion. You never move in.\nThe first step towards satori is meditation. Satori is the ultimate experience of meditation when meditation is fulfilled, when meditation has reached to its ultimate flowering .\nYOKA SAYS:\nTHE WORLD IS COMPLETE ILLUSION, YET NOTHING EXISTS WHICH MIGHT BE CALLED ILLUSION.\nThe world that you have created through your mind is illusory, but there is another world which is not your creation. When your mind disappears you discover that world: the world of suchness. That is a totally different experience. No words can describe it. Thousands of mystics have tried to describe it, but nobody has ever been able and nobody will ever be able to describe it. It is so mysterious, it is so beautiful that all words fall short. No poetry reaches to its level, no music even touches its feet.\nTHE PERFECT LIGHT OF THIS WISDOM ENLIGHTENS ONE.\nThe moment you have put your mind aside - mind means ambition, the ego trip of being this and that - the moment you have put the whole mind aside, a great light explodes in you and you are enlightened. This is satori. It does not come from the outside: you are not delivered by somebody else, you are delivered by your own being, by your own nature.\nTHAT IS POSSIBLE ONLY BY PRACTICING ZAZEN BEYOND SPECULATION. YOU CAN SEE CLOUDS NATURALLY IN THE MIRROR BUT TO HOLD ON TO THE REFLECTION IS IMPOSSIBLE.\nThat is possible only by practicing zazen... Satori is possible only by practicing zazen. Zazen means: JUST SITTING, DOING NOTHING,\nTHE SPRING COMES AND THE GRASS GROWS BY ITSELF.\nYou are simply relaxing into your own being, not doing anything at all. It is not a question of doing, it is simply a question of being. You go on relaxing into your being. A moment comes when you are in your utter purity, in your utter simplicity, in your utter innocence. That is satori.\nZazen is a beautiful word. It simply means just sitting - not even doing meditation. In fact, you cannot do meditation. Meditation is just sitting silently; it is not a question of doing. If you are doing something you are disturbing your meditation.\nSomebody is chanting a mantra; he is disturbing his meditation. Somebody is focusing on something; he is disturbing his meditation. Somebody is concentrating, somebody is praying, somebody is thinking of God: they are disturbing their meditation. All these are the doings of the mind, and if the doing continues the mind continues. Stop doing, and where is the mind? When the doing disappears, mind disappears. And the disappearance of the mind is satori.\nIt is beyond speculation, says Yoka. You cannot think about it, you can only experience it. It is the ultimate experience, and the immediate experience, too, of truth, of beauty, of love, of bliss, of God, of nirvana.\nThe third question Question 3\nOSHO, I STILL DON’T BELIEVE THAT SEX IS STUPID.\nYogesh,\nIT IS NOT A QUESTION of your believing or not believing it; such is the case. What can I do? Sex is stupid. I feel sorry for you, but I have to tell the truth some day or other. Yes, I have been telling you, “From sex to superconsciousness,” and you have been very happy - you only hear “from sex,” you don’t hear “to superconsciousness.”\nAnd this is the case with those who are against me and with those who are in favor of me - the same. Man is almost the same; friends and enemies are not very different. I am being misunderstood by the opponents, and that is understandable, but I am also being misunderstood by the followers; that is not understandable at all. The opponents can be forgiven, but the followers cannot be forgiven.\nBecause I said, “Sex is stupid,” many angry questions have come to me. One of my sannyasins, Maya, has written to me: “You have some nerve to say that sex is stupid!” She must have felt hurt. And I can understand: when you are living in a certain way you don’t want it to be described as stupid. Nobody wants to be called stupid. It is not over the question of sex that you are disturbed, it is your life. If it is stupid and you are living it, then you are being stupid. That hurts. But I have to say it even if it hurts because that is the only way to make you aware that there is something more in life, something higher, something greater, something far more blissful, far more orgasmic.\nSex is only a beginning but not the end. And nothing is wrong if you take it as a beginning; if you start clinging to it, then things start going wrong. If I say anything against homosexuality, immediately the homosexuals start writing to me. If I say anything against anything, there are people who will start writing. If it hurts your ego, then you are immediately ready to defend - not only to defend but to attack.\nYogesh, whatsoever you are doing is going to be stupid because unless something comes out of meditation it remains stupid. It is not only a question of sex. The way you eat is stupid, the things that you eat are stupid, not for any other reason than the simple reason that whatsoever you are doing is being done without any awareness. Stupidity is sleep. Stupidity is unintelligence.\nJust watch people - what they are doing, what kinds of things they are doing. And whatsoever they are doing they are doing with the feeling that this is the right thing to do, that this is the most intelligent thing to do.\nAbby, a well-stacked coed, was undressing when her roommate, Jean, said, “Do you know there is the impression of a large M on your stomach?”\n“My fiance is in town this weekend,” confided Abby, “and he likes to make love with his football-letter sweater on.”\n“Which school does he attend, Michigan or Minnesota?” questioned Jean. “Neither,” giggled Abby, “he goes to Wisconsin.”\nBut tell her fiance that this is stupid and he will hit you on the head!\nAn ugly-looking little Italian guy always succeeded in picking up the best-looking girls in his favorite bar every night. The other guys in the car just couldn’t understand how such a creep could be so irresistible to women.\nOne night they asked the bartender, “The guy’s scoring so much - what is his secret?”\n“Well,” said the bartender, “I don’t know if the guy’s hung, but he’s the only guy who comes in here who can lick his eyebrows with his tongue.”\nBut nobody can tell the guy, “You are stupid.”\nWhatsoever you are doing seems to be the most intelligent thing in the world to do. Whatsoever space you are in seems to be the right space. Everybody else may be wrong, but not you. You have to become aware of this phenomenon; this is one of the greatest illusions of humanity. You have to be watchful. You have to learn to see that, yes, there are many things that you are doing which are stupid. How can it be otherwise? You are not meditative.\nYogesh, you are not a Buddha, you are not awakened. How is it possible that you can do something which is not stupid? So whatsoever you are doing is bound to be stupid - it is out of unawareness. You go on doing things, not exactly knowing why. How did you learn them? From whom did you learn them? Why did you learn them? There are millions of stupid people just like you, and you go on imitating them, you go on learning things from them.\nSex is one of the greatest intoxicants. It is in your very biology. It releases a certain drug in your very bloodstream and you become possessed; you are no longer in your senses, you don’t know what you are doing. You are being forced to do it. Some unknown force - call it nature, biology, chemistry, hormones - whatsoever you want to call it - some unknown force, XYZ, forces you to do something. In your saner moments you also know that this is stupid: “What was I doing, and why? And what have I gained out of it?” And you know those saner moments also.\nThat’s why, after making love, many women will cry and weep, for the simple reason that the whole thing seems to be so meaningless. Why? It may be a titillation for the moment, but the same titillation again and again is a repetition; you are not reaching anywhere. And the man immediately goes to sleep after making love, for the simple reason that he wants to avoid the saner moment so he need not think about it. And by the morning he will have forgotten all about it.\nAfter making love, at least for one hour sit in zazen and you will see what I am saying. You will understand what I mean when I say sex is stupid. After making love make it a point to sit in zazen for\none hour just watching what has happened. Were you the master of it or just a slave? If you were the master of it, then it is not stupid. If you were a slave, it is stupid, because by repeating it you are making your slavery more and more strong, you are feeding your slavery.\nYogesh, it is only through meditation that you will be able to understand what I have been telling you. It is not a question to be decided by argument, it can only be decided by your own meditation, your own understanding, your own awareness.\nThe fourth question Question 4\nOSHO, I’M IN VIPASSANA. TELL ME A JOKE!\nAnand Sundardas,\nI DO FEEL FOR YOU! Vipassana is really serious! Buddha invented it so that you can pass through hell on this earth and you need not go to the real hell. It is a process of cleansing you of all your past karmas. Better finish it! It is a torture because you don’t know how to sit silently for so long. Your mind goes on thousands of trips. Sitting, sitting, sitting.You feel sleepy and that is not allowed.\nAnd if you start dozing, a hit comes on your head - a really good hit to bring you back to your senses! You cannot escape either because I go on praising vipassana so much, saying that without vipassana there is no satori, no enlightenment.\nSo you say, “Okay, somehow I will pass through it. It is only a question of a few days. And one thing is certain: that many have survived, so there is no danger to life.” Yes, your knees hurt and your body aches and you feel very restless and you are not allowed to move; you have to sit just like a Buddha-statue, doing a very stupid thing - watching your breath. Now what kind of thing is this for an intelligent man to do? And thousands of doubts arise: “What are you doing? Such a nice guy, sitting and watching your breath?” You would have made love to your girlfriend, you would have done a thousand and one things. And delicious foods appearand it looks far better to sit in the\nBlue Diamond than to sit in zazen! “Why am I sitting here? What am I doing here?”\nThe mind goes on questioning you and there really seems to be no escape because it is all voluntary; nobody has forced you. Not only that - you have to pay for it! Have you ever heard of anybody paying to suffer in hell? But when you have to pay for it, then you think it is worth the suffering.\nMulla Nasruddin was saying that when he came to India for the first time, he was feeling very hungry. As he entered through the Himalayas he came across a man selling some strange fruit, very red, very beautiful. He asked the price. The man said, “Just two paise for the whole bucketful.” So he purchased the whole bucket and then he started eating it - and it was fire! Tears were rolling down.\nAnd a man was watching and he said, ’What are you doing? This is not a fruit. You will kill yourself ! This is a medicinal herb; it has to be taken only in very small amounts for particular diseases. What are you doing? You will go mad!”\nHe said, “Whatsoever happens, happens, but since I have paid two paise for it, I have to eat it!”\nAnd he said, “I went on crying and tears went on flowing, but I finished it. I ate the whole bucketful of that nasty thing!”\nWhen you pay, then you cannot escape. And we don’t leave any loopholes; we make every effort so that nobody can escape.\nThe man was in jail for rape, murder, kidnapping and blackmail.\nThe lawyer said, “I found a loophole in your case. According to Abramovitz vs. Arcaro, January 6, 1911: Book III, Section II, page 6, paragraph 13, I think I’ve got the answer. Don’t worry, I’ll get you out. Just leave it to me. Now I’m leaving for Washington on Monday and I’ll be back Friday. Meanwhile - try to escape!”\nWe don’t leave any loopholes in the first place. There is no possibility to escape either, because whenever somebody escapes from Vipassana I send him back again. Vipassana has to be suffered for the simple reason that it makes you encounter yourself, it forces you to encounter yourself - your fidgetiness, your restlessness, your ugliness, your madness. It forces you to see all the rubbish that you are carrying within yourself. And that is one of the most essential steps to go beyond.\nIf you want to go beyond anything, first you have to encounter it. Without encountering it there is no transcendence. There is no shortcut, there is no way of bypassing it.\nIt is not that Buddha is a sadist and he is trying to torture you; he is simply making you aware of what you are. And you can never become aware if you remain occupied in your day-to-day business, in your day-today engagements. You are so engaged from morning till night that you don’t have any time, any space to look within, to feel yourself, to see who you are, where you are, what you are doing.\nVipassana forces you - there is nowhere to go. You have to watch your breath, you have to look at your thoughts day in, day out.\nAfter the seventh day, something starts settling. If you persist, if you persevere, if you are patient enough, your body learns to settle, your mind learns to settle, your breathing becomes calm and cool, almost invisible. But you can feel that something has changed; the climate is different: you are not fidgety, you are not restless. And suddenly, as if the sun had risen, all that neurotic fight disappears. The hell is over. A great peace descends on you, the silence that comes after the storm and everything seems to be clean, very clean, spotlessly pure, innocent, as if a layer of dust has disappeared from your consciousness. Your consciousness seems to be transparent. You can see for the first time the green, the red, the gold of the trees. You can hear for the first time the song of the birds - as if something which was in your ears blocking them and something which was in your eyes like a curtain has disappeared. Suddenly you feel light, very light.\nIt is said: Angels fly because they take themselves lightly. You suddenly feel like light, so full of light and so light, that you can fly, almost fly. Gravitation has disappeared. You have entered into a different world: the world of grace.\nAnd then, Sundardas, you will know a different quality of laughter arising in you. It will not be painted on the lips, it will be coming from your depth. And you will be laughing for no reason at all; you will\nbe laughter. That is Zen laughter - unmotivated, out of sheer joy, out of sheer delight, out of sheer insight into things.\nYes, you need a beautiful joke!\nAfter a day of long discussions at the World Religions Conference in Geneva, Rabbi Zuckerman found himself seated at the same dinner table as Father O alley.\nThe rabbi was partaking of koshered veal, while the priest was cutting into a thick slice of ham. “Would ya like to try some of this ham, Rabbi?” asked the priest. “It’s really good!”\n“Ach, no,” replied Rabbi Zuckerman, “it is against our religion.” “Ah, but it’s so delicious! Are ya sure ya wouldn’t like a taste?”\n“Thank you, no,” said the rabbi. “Since the time of Abraham, the flesh of the swine has been regarded as unclean by our people, and pork in all its forms is forbidden to us.”\n“Ah! Ya don’t know what you’re missin’, Rabbi,” said the priest, shoving down another mouthful of ham.\n“Ach! But you have not tasted the gefiltefish that my wife makes, Father. How about your wife, Father? Is she a good cook?”\n“Ah... well, Rabbi, that I cannot say, for I am not married.” “Not married? So what do you do for a screw?”\n“For a... what?\n“I mean - where do you get your sex?”\n“Sex?!” said the priest. “Alas, Rabbi, in my religion it is forbidden unto us, the servants of Our Lord, to partake of the ways of the flesh.”\n“You mean - you’ve never had sex?” asked the rabbi. “No, I have not!” replied the priest. “Oho! You ought to try it... it’s better than pork!”\nThe fifth question Question 5\nOSHO, DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT NOTHING BEAUTIFUL HAS EVER COME OUT OF ITALY?\nGautama,\nI AM NOT AN EXPERT ON ITALY. I have not even tasted spaghetti!\nMy first Italian sannyasin, Veet Sandeh, once prepared spaghetti for me, but it smelled so awful - it smelled just like the Italians! - that I could not eat it. And Veet Sandeh was one of the most perfect Italians. I don’t think she has ever taken a bath in her whole life!\nSo I don’t really know whether anything beautiful has ever come out of Italy or not, but I can tell you what the experts say. They say that two things have come out of Italy, two beautiful things, but both are possessed by Sophia Loren.\nThe sixth question Question 6\nOSHO, I MUST BE THE MOST GREEDY PERSON IN THE WHOLE WORLD. WHAT SHOULD I DO ABOUT IT?\nKamal,\nARE YOU CONFESSING or bragging? The world is very big and what do you know about the whole world? It is impossible to be first in anything; not even in greed can you be the first, because people are moving in circles. Nobody is the first. Don’t become so concerned with your greed and don’t feel guilty either. Everybody is greedy.\nUnless you know that you are deathless you will remain greedy; greed comes because of death. You may never have thought about it, but greed exists because we are afraid of death. Because death is there we want to have as much of life as possible; we are greedy. We want to eat more, we want to have as many women or men as possible, we want to have as much money as possible, because death is there. “Soon everything will be finished, so before it happens have all that is possible, don’t miss a thing.” That’s how greed arises. Greed is nothing but fear of death. Greed is out of fear; it is the fearful person who becomes greedy.\nThe really fearless person is not greedy at all; he shares. He is not possessive, he is very happy to give. He goes on giving whatsoever he has; he goes on giving for the sheer joy of giving.\nYou will remain greedy, Kamal, unless you experience your eternity: that death is not going to make any dent in you, that death is not going to make any change in you, that death is only of the body, your consciousness continues. Your consciousness is the only eternal phenomenon. Everything else changes, but not your consciousness. But you don’t know anything about consciousness, hence the greed.\nAll the religions of the world have been teaching, “Don’t be greedy,” but that has not made any difference. That has made people greedy for the other world, that’s all. That has made people greedy for heaven and heavenly joys, that’s all. But that has not changed their greed; it has even increased their greed. I don’t tell you not to be greedy. I say be conscious, be more conscious, and you will be surprised: as your consciousness grows, greed starts disappearing. Like dead leaves it starts falling; it leaves no trace behind.\nSkolnik, the Scarsdale skinflint, awoke one morning to find that during the night his wife had died. After one glance at the stark form lying there beside him, he leaped out of bed and ran into the hall.\n“Daisy,” he called down to the maid in the kitchen “come to the foot of the stairs, quick!” ’Yes,” she cried. “What is it?”\n“Only one egg for breakfast this morning!” Can you beat that?\nWhen the Internal Revenue Service hauled him in and wanted to know why he claimed his mother as an exemption in spite of the fact that she had been dead for five years, Bernstein said, “Oh, but Mom is still very much alive in my heart.”\nA Jewish couple went to a shopping center and left their child and carriage with the other carriages in front of the place. After shopping, they started for home. A few blocks later, the wife turned to her husband, who was wheeling the carriage, and cried in panic, “That’s not our child!”\n“Shut up your big mouth!” he replied. “This is a better carriage.”\nPeople are living in greed. Kamal, it will be difficult to be the first! Even to be aware that you are greedy is a good sign: it is a beginning, a good beginning, if you become aware of it. And remember, don’t become guilty about it because that is a way of losing your awareness again. Don’t start repenting of it because repenting means you are thinking about the past, which is no more. Don’t start trying to be non-greedy because whatsoever you do will be greed-even the effort to be nongreedy will only be rooted in greed. One can become so greedy about being non-greedy!\nI have seen people who have become so greedy about being non-greedy that they go on and on renouncing this and that. Their greed has taken a new turn: it is standing upside down, it is doing a sirshasan, a headstand. Now they are greedy about non-greed; non-greed has become their possession, their money, their power. Now they are respected for their non-greed. They were respected first for their money; now they are respected for renouncing the money. Now they go on renouncing as much as they can - to the fullest extreme. They can renounce clothes, they can stand naked. They can renounce everything, but deep down the greed is there, they are still greedy. It is simply greed and nothing else. Now they are hoping that they will be rewarded in paradise - a great reward is waiting for them.\nSo don’t try to become non-greedy. A greedy person cannot do anything about greed. And that’s so about other things also. An angry person trying to be nonangry is not going to change his being. A violent person trying to be non-violent will still remain violent; his violence will now take subtle forms.\nThe only thing that is possible is to be conscious of your greed. And I am not saying that you will be rewarded in paradise, I am not saying anything about the future. I am simply saying that if you become aware of greed it disappears. And when it disappears, life is bliss here and now - not in the future, not as a reward.\nGreed cripples you, anger cripples you, violence cripples you. When they all disappearAnd\nthey all disappear through one method. A single method is enough - meditation is enough. All the diseases disappear through taking a single medicine.\nThe words “medicine” and “meditation” come from the same root. Meditation is the ultimate medicine: it cures you of all ills.\nRemember Yoka again. He says: Don’t cut the branches, cut the root.\nUnconsciousness is the root, Kamal. Cut the root, be conscious, and then, herenow, you are a new person. Herenow, your life is transformed, you become luminous, you radiate bliss, you radiate benediction, you become paradise.\nWherever a man of awareness moves there is paradise. You cannot send a man of bliss, of awareness, of meditation, of satori, to hell, because if he reaches hell hell will be paradise for him. And you cannot send an unconscious man into paradise because wherever he is he will find his hell. If it is not there he will invent his hell - his unconsciousness will project his hell.\nReduced to a simple principle, the whole philosophy of all the awakened ones is: Unconsciousness is hell, consciousness is heaven.\nThe seventh question Question 7\nOSHO, I WAS BORN ON FEBRUARY 29TH, HENCE MY BIRTHDAY COMES ONLY ONCE IN FOUR YEARS. IS THERE SOME SIGNIFICANCE IN IT?\nGandharva,\nJANUARY OR FEBRUARY OR MARCH February 28th or 29th - these are all arbitrary. These are our imposed ideas. Existence knows nothing of February, March. Even if you were born on April 1st there is no significance in it! You will not be a bigger fool than you are, you will be the same. What significance can February 29th have? But people want some significance.\nI have heard about only one accident that has happened on February 29th: that is the birth of Morarji Desai.\nZoo keeper to tourists: “In this cage we see the leopard. This animal has one black spot for every day of the year.”\nOld lady: “What about a leap year?”\nZoo keeper, thinking fast: “Ah yes - behold, madam, I lift his tail thus - behold the 29th of February!” And the last question\nQuestion 8 OSHO,\nHOW DO YOU MANAGE TO DELIVER SO MANY BEAUTIFUL DISCOURSES?\nDevakar\nWHAT DISCOURSES? You call this yakkety-yak discourse? Discourse is a serious phenomenon! Discourse is something religious, holy, sacred. It is delivered in churches, temples. This place is not a church. This place belongs to the drunkards - it is a pub! What discourse? I have never delivered any discourse. Yes, I gossip, that is true, but there is no gospel in it and there is no art, no secret in it. It is very simple - my method is very simple.\nA great emperor was passing through a village. He was one of the most famous warriors of those days and he was a lover of archery. He loved the people who were perfect archers. Passing through the village he saw on many trees, lampposts, and garden fences, arrows sticking exactly in the middle of circles - exactly in the middle, at the centers, of circles. So many arrows everywhere... he was surprised.\nHe asked, “Who is this man? I have never seen such a perfect archer! His aim is perfect, he never misses, not even by a fragment of an inch. The arrow always goes exactly into the center. Each target is a proof of it.” He stopped his chariot, he called the people of the village. He said, “Who is this man?”\nAnd they all laughed and said, “Don’t be worried about him. He is a madman!”\nHe said, “What do you mean by madman? He may be mad, but he is the greatest archer I have seen.”\nThey said, “It is nothing to do with archery. He knows nothing about archery.” The king said, “But then it is a puzzle. How does he manage?”\nThey said, “It is simple. First he shoots the arrow at the tree and then he goes and makes a circle around it!”\nThat’s exactly my method. It is simple! Hence you can ask anything. Whatsoever I want to say, I say it. First I shoot the arrow and then I draw a circle around it - just as a finishing touch!\nA parish priest was having a few words with his bishop and in the course of conversation said, “It’s all right for you, my Lord. When you prepare a sermon you can deliver it to several churches in the diocese, but I have to give two new sermons every Sunday.”\nThe bishop replied, “You should be able to give a sermon on almost any subject at a moment’s notice, as I can.”\n“I’ll take you up on that,” said the parson. “You come to my church next Sunday and I will put you to the test.”\nThe bishop agreed and in due course went to the pulpit to find a card with the one word “constipation” written on it. Without hesitation he started, “And Moses took two tablets and went out onto the mountain side.”\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7431","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/walking_in_zen_sitting_in_zen/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/walking_in_zen_sitting_in_zen/>Walking in Zen, Sitting in Zen</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">4 A Question Of Being</h1><div class=post-meta>35 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7431 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Walking_in_Zen_Sitting_in_Zen/part4.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

BE ACCEPTING OR EVEN CREATIVE WITH THIS? I FEEL TOTALLY CONFUSED.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Helmut,</p><p><br></p><p>MIND LIVES IN THE DUALITY of the positive and the negative. It lives
like a pendulum, moving from yes to no, from no to yes. It cannot live
in the absolute yes, it cannot live in the absolute no. Absolute yes
means now there is no possibility for the pendulum to move anywhere.
Absolute no also means the same: no space for the mind to play games.
Anything absolute is a death for the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>There are two possibilities of killing the mind, of transcending the
mind: either absolute yes or absolute no. The Upanishads have used the
first possibility, absolute yes, and Buddha has used the second
possibility, absolute no. But look deeply and you will find they are not
different, they are bridged by the same phenomenon - absoluteness.
Anything absolute becomes the grave of the mind; it needs duality to
exist.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why you are so afraid of the absolute negative, because in the
absolute you start disappearing. You are your mind. Of course, there is
something more in you than your mind, but</p><p>you are not aware of it. And as you start disappearing, fear arises,
confusion arises; one is scared, one wants to cling to whatsoever is
available to cling to.</p><p><br></p><p>It is because of this miracle of the absolute that God has been
synonymous with the absolute. God means the absolute. Either say
absolute yes and your mind disappears, or say absolute no and your mind
disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>Why has Buddha chosen to say absolute no, why not absolute yes? For a
certain reason: with the absolute yes there is one danger. The danger is
that you may not understand the absoluteness of the yes; you may still
go on thinking that it is your old positivity. With the absolute no that
danger is not possible. With the absolute no, death seems so clear that
you cannot miss it - hence the confusion.</p><p><br></p><p>This confusion is good. Don’t try to escape from it, go deeper into
it. Soon it will become a chaos</p><p>- not just confusion but chaos. When all that you have known about
yourself is shattered, when all that you have believed in has
evaporated, when all that you were identified with has slipped out of
your hands - the very earth beneath you is no longer available, you are
falling and falling into a bottomless abyss - that is chaos. And only
out of chaos are stars born. Out of chaos is creativity.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask: How can I be accepting or even creative with this?</p><p><br></p><p>There is no question of accepting because every acceptance means that
deep down there is rejection. Otherwise, why the question of acceptance?
Why in the first place do you think of accepting? You must be rejecting
somewhere.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t accept life because I don’t reject it in the first place. It
is simply there, neither rejected nor accepted. It is so. Buddha calls
it tathata, suchness.</p><p><br></p><p>A man came to Buddha and asked, “What should we do with death? Should
we accept it?”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “There is no question of accepting or rejecting. Death
is! It is so. Such is the nature of things: they are born one day, one
day they die.”</p><p><br></p><p>Why do you think of rejecting or accepting? If you try to accept,
that simply means a kind of repression. First you must have rejected;
you must be still rejecting and you are covering up your rejection with
acceptance. Deep down you are angry and on the surface you are smiling,
you are all smiles. Deep down you are sad; on the surface you are
laughing and trying to hide the fact not only from others but from
yourself too.</p><p><br></p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche has said, “I laugh because I am afraid that if I
don’t laugh I will start crying and weeping. I go on laughing just to
avoid the possibility of crying and weeping. I don’t want to cry and
weep. I want to forget that there are tears in me.”</p><p><br></p><p>But this is just a cover-up; this laughter is not true. This is not
the laughter of the Buddhas - it can’t be. It is the desperate effort of
a split mind. This is schizophrenia: one part wants to cry, another part
is trying to hide it. You are in conflict. But we are brought up in
conflict, we have learned how to live in conflict - this has become our
very life style. It is not a question of accepting.</p><p>True acceptance is not an acceptance at all. You will be surprised by
my statement: true acceptance is not an acceptance at all. True
acceptance is absence of rejection and acceptance. One simply knows that
this is how things are - the suchness of things, tathata.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence one of the beautiful names of Buddha: Tathagata. The Buddhist
scriptures always use the word tathagata for Buddha: one who lives in
suchness, neither rejecting nor accepting, simply seeing whatsoever is
the case, only reflecting.</p><p><br></p><p>And you ask me: How is creativity possible out of this absolute
negativity? You don’t know anything about creativity. Creativity comes
only out of total negation, it comes out of absolute emptiness. The
whole world has come out of nothingness and the whole world will one day
move into nothingness.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the scientists have stumbled upon one of the most important
discoveries ever: the discovery of the black hole. They say there are a
few spots in existence, which can be called black holes, where if
anything comes close it is sucked in by the black hole and it
disappears, it becomes nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is only half the story; the other half has still to be
discovered. I can predict it will be discovered soon: the white hole,
the other side of the black hole, from which things start coming out of
nothingness. Existence goes into rest, then nothingness prevails. When
the rest is over, existence again becomes active, manifest; then
creativity prevails. Creativity comes out of nothingness.</p><p><br></p><p>The more you are a nobody, the more you know that there is no ego in
you, the more creativity will flow through you. You will become a
vehicle, you will become a passage. Songs will pour out of you - and
music and love and joy. And whatsoever you touch will be transformed
into gold, and whatsoever you say will have something poetic in it, and
whatsoever you do will have grace, will have something divine about it,
something sacred and holy.</p><p><br></p><p>Creativity is nothing that you have to do; you are the barrier - it
is because of you that creativity is prevented. Make way. Don’t stand in
between. Move yourself away and let your void, your inner void, face
existence. And the inner void will reflect the existence and, out of
that reflection, creativity is born.</p><p><br></p><p>But I am not talking about ordinary creativity: that you compose a
poem or you paint a small painting or you sculpt. These things can be
done without being creative; all that you need to know is the art, the
technique of doing them. Out of one hundred so-called creators it is
very rare to find even one or two who are real creators; ninety-nine
percent are only composers, not creators. They know how to put words
together, they are clever, they are cunning, they are crafty; what they
are doing is not creativity. They are putting things together - maybe in
new arrangements, but there is nothing original.</p><p><br></p><p>The original always comes from an egoless state, it always comes when
you are absent. When you are absent, consciousness is present, God is
present. And then something miraculous starts happening, not by you but
through you. It gives you a great feeling of humbleness and
gratitude.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t be worried about absolute negativity; that is one of the
most beautiful spaces to be in. One can be in that space through
absolute positivity also, but there is a danger: your mind can play
tricks with the absolute positive. But it cannot play tricks with the
absolute negative. With the absolute positive it can still hope to
remain in some way or other; the positive seems to be sheltering,
safe.</p><p>Hence, except with Gautam the Buddha, every other religion has used
the positive. It is only Buddha who has used the negative. But you must
know that more people have become enlightened through Gautam Buddha’s
approach than through all the other approaches put together for the
simple reason that with the absolute negative there is no safety, no
shelter at all for the mind, for the ego. It is total death.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why you are confused. I am happy that you are confused. I will
be more happy if your confusion becomes a chaos. I will be still more
happy if you disappear into a black hole, because then the only thing
possible is that you will come out of a white hole. You will be
resurrected.</p><p><br></p><p>Crucifixion is the way of resurrection. Death is the way of being
reborn. The second question</p><p>Question 2 OSHO,</p><p>WHAT IS SATORI AND HOW TO ATTAIN IT?</p><p><br></p><p>Pratima,</p><p><br></p><p>SATORI IS EXACTLY YOUR ORDINARY NATURE; it is not anything special.
Hence there is no question of attaining it - it is already the case. You
are in it, you have just forgotten. You have become too occupied with
the outside world. You have forgotten your own kingdom, you have
forgotten your own treasure, you have forgotten yourself. You have
become too concerned with others. You are too much in the world and you
don’t give any time, any space for your inner nature to have a dialogue
with you, to whisper a few things to you. You have become
artificial.</p><p><br></p><p>You have created a false ego because nobody can live without a
center. You have forgotten your real center, and nobody can live without
a center, so you have created a false center as a substitute. That’s the
ego. Ego simply means living with a false center.</p><p><br></p><p>Satori is dropping the false, entering into the real; just being
yourself, your natural self, your ordinary self.</p><p><br></p><p>The word “ordinary” has to be remembered because the mind is not
interested in the ordinary at all; it wants to be extraordinary, it
wants to be special. It is through being special that the ego survives.
It is constantly striving to be more special, more special. It wants to
be more rich, more powerful, more respectable; it is ambitious. Hence
the word “ordinary” has no appeal for the mind. And that is the beauty
of the word “ordinary” - because it has no appeal for the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is an achiever and the ordinary need not be achieved; it is
already the case. The extraordinary has to be achieved, the
extraordinary becomes the goal. It is far away; you have to make all
kinds of efforts, you have to struggle for it, you have to fight for it
because there are so many competitors.</p><p><br></p><p>To be ordinary... and there is no competition at all. You can just be
ordinary, nobody has any objection. People will simply feel sorry for
you that you have dropped out of the competitive race.</p><p>One competitor less - they will feel good but sorry for you. They
will say, “Poor fellow! What happened to him? Why did he have to drop
out?” The dropouts are not respectable people.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha is a dropout. All real Masters are dropouts. To be a sannyasin
means to be a dropout. To drop out of the rat race is to drop in,
because when you are in the race you cannot enter in. When you are no
longer in the race there is nowhere to go. You start moving inwards
because life is a flow: if there is no outer direction it takes the
inner direction. If the goal is not there far away in the future, then
you start moving into your nature in the present. That is satori.</p><p><br></p><p>Satori is very ordinary. Satori means your nature. You have come with
it; it is your original face - all other faces are masks.</p><p><br></p><p>YOKA SAYS:</p><p><br></p><p>A DISCIPLE SPEAKS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ULTIMATE, THE ABSOLUTE
TRUTH. REMEMBER THAT ONE SHOULD CUT THE ROOT AND NOT THE BRANCHES AND
THE LEAVES.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the root of your misery? The root is your ambition, desiring.
One wants to be this and that, one wants to possess this and that, one
wants to be somebody, one wants to be significant.</p><p><br></p><p>Yoka says: Cut the root... only then are you a disciple. And the
moment you cut the root - not the branches, not the leaves - you attain
the ultimate truth. The ultimate truth is not far away; it is the
immediate truth, it is your truth, it is your very being.</p><p><br></p><p>Most people do not recognize the perfect jewel, the jewel of supreme
wisdom, satori. It is hidden in the secret place of Tathagata, awaiting
its discovery.</p><p><br></p><p>It is to live in your suchness; it is hidden in your suchness.
Whatsoever you are, live in it. Don’t create any conflict, don’t live
through the ideal. Don’t be an idealist, just be natural.</p><p><br></p><p>But everybody is being taught to be an idealist: “Become a Jesus” or
“Become a Buddha” or “Become a Krishna.” Nobody tells you just to be
yourself! Why should you be a Jesus? One Jesus is enough and one Jesus
is beautiful - he enriches the existence. Many Jesuses just carrying
crosses, and wherever you go you meet them... It won’t look beautiful,
it won’t add to the beauty of existence; it will make the whole world
ugly. Wherever you go you meet a Mahavira standing naked.…</p><p><br></p><p>It is because of this that God never creates the same person again.
He never repeats; he is original. He always creates a new person. You
have never been before, and there is no one who is like you, and there
will never be anybody else like you again. In the whole of eternity you
alone are just like you. Look at the beauty of it and the glory of it
and the respect that God has shown to you! What more respectability do
you need? See the uniqueness of yourself. There is no need to be unique;
you are already unique, just as everybody else is unique. You are unique
in your ordinariness, in your suchness.</p><p><br></p><p>SATORI IS HIDDEN, SAYS YOKA, IN THE SECRET PLACE OF YOUR SUCHNESS,
AWAITING ITS DISCOVERY.</p><p>It has not to be created, it is already there; you just have to
discover it. Go in and discover it! It is waiting and waiting. And
centuries have passed and many many lives have passed, and you have
become addicted to extroversion. You never move in.</p><p><br></p><p>The first step towards satori is meditation. Satori is the ultimate
experience of meditation when meditation is fulfilled, when meditation
has reached to its ultimate flowering .</p><p><br></p><p>YOKA SAYS:</p><p><br></p><p>THE WORLD IS COMPLETE ILLUSION, YET NOTHING EXISTS WHICH MIGHT BE
CALLED ILLUSION.</p><p><br></p><p>The world that you have created through your mind is illusory, but
there is another world which is not your creation. When your mind
disappears you discover that world: the world of suchness. That is a
totally different experience. No words can describe it. Thousands of
mystics have tried to describe it, but nobody has ever been able and
nobody will ever be able to describe it. It is so mysterious, it is so
beautiful that all words fall short. No poetry reaches to its level, no
music even touches its feet.</p><p><br></p><p>THE PERFECT LIGHT OF THIS WISDOM ENLIGHTENS ONE.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment you have put your mind aside - mind means ambition, the
ego trip of being this and that - the moment you have put the whole mind
aside, a great light explodes in you and you are enlightened. This is
satori. It does not come from the outside: you are not delivered by
somebody else, you are delivered by your own being, by your own
nature.</p><p><br></p><p>THAT IS POSSIBLE ONLY BY PRACTICING ZAZEN BEYOND SPECULATION. YOU CAN
SEE CLOUDS NATURALLY IN THE MIRROR BUT TO HOLD ON TO THE REFLECTION IS
IMPOSSIBLE.</p><p><br></p><p>That is possible only by practicing zazen... Satori is possible only
by practicing zazen. Zazen means: JUST SITTING, DOING NOTHING,</p><p>THE SPRING COMES AND THE GRASS GROWS BY ITSELF.</p><p><br></p><p>You are simply relaxing into your own being, not doing anything at
all. It is not a question of doing, it is simply a question of being.
You go on relaxing into your being. A moment comes when you are in your
utter purity, in your utter simplicity, in your utter innocence. That is
satori.</p><p><br></p><p>Zazen is a beautiful word. It simply means just sitting - not even
doing meditation. In fact, you cannot do meditation. Meditation is just
sitting silently; it is not a question of doing. If you are doing
something you are disturbing your meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody is chanting a mantra; he is disturbing his meditation.
Somebody is focusing on something; he is disturbing his meditation.
Somebody is concentrating, somebody is praying, somebody is thinking of
God: they are disturbing their meditation. All these are the doings of
the mind, and if the doing continues the mind continues. Stop doing, and
where is the mind? When the doing disappears, mind disappears. And the
disappearance of the mind is satori.</p><p>It is beyond speculation, says Yoka. You cannot think about it, you
can only experience it. It is the ultimate experience, and the immediate
experience, too, of truth, of beauty, of love, of bliss, of God, of
nirvana.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question Question 3</p><p>OSHO, I STILL DON’T BELIEVE THAT SEX IS STUPID.</p><p><br></p><p>Yogesh,</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS NOT A QUESTION of your believing or not believing it; such is
the case. What can I do? Sex is stupid. I feel sorry for you, but I have
to tell the truth some day or other. Yes, I have been telling you, “From
sex to superconsciousness,” and you have been very happy - you only hear
“from sex,” you don’t hear “to superconsciousness.”</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the case with those who are against me and with those who
are in favor of me - the same. Man is almost the same; friends and
enemies are not very different. I am being misunderstood by the
opponents, and that is understandable, but I am also being misunderstood
by the followers; that is not understandable at all. The opponents can
be forgiven, but the followers cannot be forgiven.</p><p><br></p><p>Because I said, “Sex is stupid,” many angry questions have come to
me. One of my sannyasins, Maya, has written to me: “You have some nerve
to say that sex is stupid!” She must have felt hurt. And I can
understand: when you are living in a certain way you don’t want it to be
described as stupid. Nobody wants to be called stupid. It is not over
the question of sex that you are disturbed, it is your life. If it is
stupid and you are living it, then you are being stupid. That hurts. But
I have to say it even if it hurts because that is the only way to make
you aware that there is something more in life, something higher,
something greater, something far more blissful, far more orgasmic.</p><p><br></p><p>Sex is only a beginning but not the end. And nothing is wrong if you
take it as a beginning; if you start clinging to it, then things start
going wrong. If I say anything against homosexuality, immediately the
homosexuals start writing to me. If I say anything against anything,
there are people who will start writing. If it hurts your ego, then you
are immediately ready to defend - not only to defend but to attack.</p><p><br></p><p>Yogesh, whatsoever you are doing is going to be stupid because unless
something comes out of meditation it remains stupid. It is not only a
question of sex. The way you eat is stupid, the things that you eat are
stupid, not for any other reason than the simple reason that whatsoever
you are doing is being done without any awareness. Stupidity is sleep.
Stupidity is unintelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>Just watch people - what they are doing, what kinds of things they
are doing. And whatsoever they are doing they are doing with the feeling
that this is the right thing to do, that this is the most intelligent
thing to do.</p><p><br></p><p>Abby, a well-stacked coed, was undressing when her roommate, Jean,
said, “Do you know there is the impression of a large M on your
stomach?”</p><p>“My fiance is in town this weekend,” confided Abby, “and he likes to
make love with his football-letter sweater on.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Which school does he attend, Michigan or Minnesota?” questioned
Jean. “Neither,” giggled Abby, “he goes to Wisconsin.”</p><p>But tell her fiance that this is stupid and he will hit you on the
head!</p><p><br></p><p>An ugly-looking little Italian guy always succeeded in picking up the
best-looking girls in his favorite bar every night. The other guys in
the car just couldn’t understand how such a creep could be so
irresistible to women.</p><p><br></p><p>One night they asked the bartender, “The guy’s scoring so much - what
is his secret?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” said the bartender, “I don’t know if the guy’s hung, but he’s
the only guy who comes in here who can lick his eyebrows with his
tongue.”</p><p><br></p><p>But nobody can tell the guy, “You are stupid.”</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever you are doing seems to be the most intelligent thing in
the world to do. Whatsoever space you are in seems to be the right
space. Everybody else may be wrong, but not you. You have to become
aware of this phenomenon; this is one of the greatest illusions of
humanity. You have to be watchful. You have to learn to see that, yes,
there are many things that you are doing which are stupid. How can it be
otherwise? You are not meditative.</p><p><br></p><p>Yogesh, you are not a Buddha, you are not awakened. How is it
possible that you can do something which is not stupid? So whatsoever
you are doing is bound to be stupid - it is out of unawareness. You go
on doing things, not exactly knowing why. How did you learn them? From
whom did you learn them? Why did you learn them? There are millions of
stupid people just like you, and you go on imitating them, you go on
learning things from them.</p><p><br></p><p>Sex is one of the greatest intoxicants. It is in your very biology.
It releases a certain drug in your very bloodstream and you become
possessed; you are no longer in your senses, you don’t know what you are
doing. You are being forced to do it. Some unknown force - call it
nature, biology, chemistry, hormones - whatsoever you want to call it -
some unknown force, XYZ, forces you to do something. In your saner
moments you also know that this is stupid: “What was I doing, and why?
And what have I gained out of it?” And you know those saner moments
also.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why, after making love, many women will cry and weep, for the
simple reason that the whole thing seems to be so meaningless. Why? It
may be a titillation for the moment, but the same titillation again and
again is a repetition; you are not reaching anywhere. And the man
immediately goes to sleep after making love, for the simple reason that
he wants to avoid the saner moment so he need not think about it. And by
the morning he will have forgotten all about it.</p><p><br></p><p>After making love, at least for one hour sit in zazen and you will
see what I am saying. You will understand what I mean when I say sex is
stupid. After making love make it a point to sit in zazen for</p><p>one hour just watching what has happened. Were you the master of it
or just a slave? If you were the master of it, then it is not stupid. If
you were a slave, it is stupid, because by repeating it you are making
your slavery more and more strong, you are feeding your slavery.</p><p><br></p><p>Yogesh, it is only through meditation that you will be able to
understand what I have been telling you. It is not a question to be
decided by argument, it can only be decided by your own meditation, your
own understanding, your own awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question Question 4</p><p>OSHO, I’M IN VIPASSANA. TELL ME A JOKE!</p><p><br></p><p>Anand Sundardas,</p><p><br></p><p>I DO FEEL FOR YOU! Vipassana is really serious! Buddha invented it so
that you can pass through hell on this earth and you need not go to the
real hell. It is a process of cleansing you of all your past karmas.
Better finish it! It is a torture because you don’t know how to sit
silently for so long. Your mind goes on thousands of trips. Sitting,
sitting, sitting.<span class=s4></span>You feel sleepy and that is not
allowed.</p><p>And if you start dozing, a hit comes on your head - a really good hit
to bring you back to your senses! You cannot escape either because I go
on praising vipassana so much, saying that without vipassana there is no
satori, no enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>So you say, “Okay, somehow I will pass through it. It is only a
question of a few days. And one thing is certain: that many have
survived, so there is no danger to life.” Yes, your knees hurt and your
body aches and you feel very restless and you are not allowed to move;
you have to sit just like a Buddha-statue, doing a very stupid thing -
watching your breath. Now what kind of thing is this for an intelligent
man to do? And thousands of doubts arise: “What are you doing? Such a
nice guy, sitting and watching your breath?” You would have made love to
your girlfriend, you would have done a thousand and one things. And
delicious foods appear<span class=s4></span>and it looks far better to
sit in the</p><p>Blue Diamond than to sit in zazen! “Why am I sitting here? What am I
doing here?”</p><p><br></p><p>The mind goes on questioning you and there really seems to be no
escape because it is all voluntary; nobody has forced you. Not only that
- you have to pay for it! Have you ever heard of anybody paying to
suffer in hell? But when you have to pay for it, then you think it is
worth the suffering.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin was saying that when he came to India for the first
time, he was feeling very hungry. As he entered through the Himalayas he
came across a man selling some strange fruit, very red, very beautiful.
He asked the price. The man said, “Just two paise for the whole
bucketful.” So he purchased the whole bucket and then he started eating
it - and it was fire! Tears were rolling down.</p><p><br></p><p>And a man was watching and he said, ’What are you doing? This is not
a fruit. You will kill yourself ! This is a medicinal herb; it has to be
taken only in very small amounts for particular diseases. What are you
doing? You will go mad!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Whatsoever happens, happens, but since I have paid two
paise for it, I have to eat it!”</p><p>And he said, “I went on crying and tears went on flowing, but I
finished it. I ate the whole bucketful of that nasty thing!”</p><p><br></p><p>When you pay, then you cannot escape. And we don’t leave any
loopholes; we make every effort so that nobody can escape.</p><p><br></p><p>The man was in jail for rape, murder, kidnapping and blackmail.</p><p><br></p><p>The lawyer said, “I found a loophole in your case. According to
Abramovitz vs. Arcaro, January 6, 1911: Book III, Section II, page 6,
paragraph 13, I think I’ve got the answer. Don’t worry, I’ll get you
out. Just leave it to me. Now I’m leaving for Washington on Monday and
I’ll be back Friday. Meanwhile - try to escape!”</p><p><br></p><p>We don’t leave any loopholes in the first place. There is no
possibility to escape either, because whenever somebody escapes from
Vipassana I send him back again. Vipassana has to be suffered for the
simple reason that it makes you encounter yourself, it forces you to
encounter yourself - your fidgetiness, your restlessness, your ugliness,
your madness. It forces you to see all the rubbish that you are carrying
within yourself. And that is one of the most essential steps to go
beyond.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to go beyond anything, first you have to encounter it.
Without encountering it there is no transcendence. There is no shortcut,
there is no way of bypassing it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not that Buddha is a sadist and he is trying to torture you; he
is simply making you aware of what you are. And you can never become
aware if you remain occupied in your day-to-day business, in your
day-today engagements. You are so engaged from morning till night that
you don’t have any time, any space to look within, to feel yourself, to
see who you are, where you are, what you are doing.</p><p><br></p><p>Vipassana forces you - there is nowhere to go. You have to watch your
breath, you have to look at your thoughts day in, day out.</p><p><br></p><p>After the seventh day, something starts settling. If you persist, if
you persevere, if you are patient enough, your body learns to settle,
your mind learns to settle, your breathing becomes calm and cool, almost
invisible. But you can feel that something has changed; the climate is
different: you are not fidgety, you are not restless. And suddenly, as
if the sun had risen, all that neurotic fight disappears. The hell is
over. A great peace descends on you, the silence that comes after the
storm and everything seems to be clean, very clean, spotlessly pure,
innocent, as if a layer of dust has disappeared from your consciousness.
Your consciousness seems to be transparent. You can see for the first
time the green, the red, the gold of the trees. You can hear for the
first time the song of the birds - as if something which was in your
ears blocking them and something which was in your eyes like a curtain
has disappeared. Suddenly you feel light, very light.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said: Angels fly because they take themselves lightly. You
suddenly feel like light, so full of light and so light, that you can
fly, almost fly. Gravitation has disappeared. You have entered into a
different world: the world of grace.</p><p><br></p><p>And then, Sundardas, you will know a different quality of laughter
arising in you. It will not be painted on the lips, it will be coming
from your depth. And you will be laughing for no reason at all; you
will</p><p>be laughter. That is Zen laughter - unmotivated, out of sheer joy,
out of sheer delight, out of sheer insight into things.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, you need a beautiful joke!</p><p><br></p><p>After a day of long discussions at the World Religions Conference in
Geneva, Rabbi Zuckerman found himself seated at the same dinner table as
Father O alley.</p><p><br></p><p>The rabbi was partaking of koshered veal, while the priest was
cutting into a thick slice of ham. “Would ya like to try some of this
ham, Rabbi?” asked the priest. “It’s really good!”</p><p>“Ach, no,” replied Rabbi Zuckerman, “it is against our religion.”
“Ah, but it’s so delicious! Are ya sure ya wouldn’t like a taste?”</p><p>“Thank you, no,” said the rabbi. “Since the time of Abraham, the
flesh of the swine has been regarded as unclean by our people, and pork
in all its forms is forbidden to us.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah! Ya don’t know what you’re missin’, Rabbi,” said the priest,
shoving down another mouthful of ham.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ach! But you have not tasted the gefiltefish that my wife makes,
Father. How about your wife, Father? Is she a good cook?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah... well, Rabbi, that I cannot say, for I am not married.” “Not
married? So what do you do for a screw?”</p><p>“For a... what?</p><p><br></p><p>“I mean - where do you get your sex?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sex?!” said the priest. “Alas, Rabbi, in my religion it is forbidden
unto us, the servants of Our Lord, to partake of the ways of the
flesh.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You mean - you’ve never had sex?” asked the rabbi. “No, I have not!”
replied the priest. “Oho! You ought to try it... it’s better than
pork!”</p><p><br></p><p>The fifth question Question 5</p><p>OSHO, DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT NOTHING BEAUTIFUL HAS EVER COME OUT OF
ITALY?</p><p><br></p><p>Gautama,</p><p><br></p><p>I AM NOT AN EXPERT ON ITALY. I have not even tasted spaghetti!</p><p>My first Italian sannyasin, Veet Sandeh, once prepared spaghetti for
me, but it smelled so awful - it smelled just like the Italians! - that
I could not eat it. And Veet Sandeh was one of the most perfect
Italians. I don’t think she has ever taken a bath in her whole life!</p><p><br></p><p>So I don’t really know whether anything beautiful has ever come out
of Italy or not, but I can tell you what the experts say. They say that
two things have come out of Italy, two beautiful things, but both are
possessed by Sophia Loren.</p><p><br></p><p>The sixth question Question 6</p><p>OSHO, I MUST BE THE MOST GREEDY PERSON IN THE WHOLE WORLD. WHAT
SHOULD I DO ABOUT IT?</p><p><br></p><p>Kamal,</p><p><br></p><p>ARE YOU CONFESSING or bragging? The world is very big and what do you
know about the whole world? It is impossible to be first in anything;
not even in greed can you be the first, because people are moving in
circles. Nobody is the first. Don’t become so concerned with your greed
and don’t feel guilty either. Everybody is greedy.</p><p><br></p><p>Unless you know that you are deathless you will remain greedy; greed
comes because of death. You may never have thought about it, but greed
exists because we are afraid of death. Because death is there we want to
have as much of life as possible; we are greedy. We want to eat more, we
want to have as many women or men as possible, we want to have as much
money as possible, because death is there. “Soon everything will be
finished, so before it happens have all that is possible, don’t miss a
thing.” That’s how greed arises. Greed is nothing but fear of death.
Greed is out of fear; it is the fearful person who becomes greedy.</p><p><br></p><p>The really fearless person is not greedy at all; he shares. He is not
possessive, he is very happy to give. He goes on giving whatsoever he
has; he goes on giving for the sheer joy of giving.</p><p><br></p><p>You will remain greedy, Kamal, unless you experience your eternity:
that death is not going to make any dent in you, that death is not going
to make any change in you, that death is only of the body, your
consciousness continues. Your consciousness is the only eternal
phenomenon. Everything else changes, but not your consciousness. But you
don’t know anything about consciousness, hence the greed.</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions of the world have been teaching, “Don’t be greedy,”
but that has not made any difference. That has made people greedy for
the other world, that’s all. That has made people greedy for heaven and
heavenly joys, that’s all. But that has not changed their greed; it has
even increased their greed. I don’t tell you not to be greedy. I say be
conscious, be more conscious, and you will be surprised: as your
consciousness grows, greed starts disappearing. Like dead leaves it
starts falling; it leaves no trace behind.</p><p><br></p><p>Skolnik, the Scarsdale skinflint, awoke one morning to find that
during the night his wife had died. After one glance at the stark form
lying there beside him, he leaped out of bed and ran into the hall.</p><p>“Daisy,” he called down to the maid in the kitchen “come to the foot
of the stairs, quick!” ’Yes,” she cried. “What is it?”</p><p>“Only one egg for breakfast this morning!” Can you beat that?</p><p>When the Internal Revenue Service hauled him in and wanted to know
why he claimed his mother as an exemption in spite of the fact that she
had been dead for five years, Bernstein said, “Oh, but Mom is still very
much alive in my heart.”</p><p><br></p><p>A Jewish couple went to a shopping center and left their child and
carriage with the other carriages in front of the place. After shopping,
they started for home. A few blocks later, the wife turned to her
husband, who was wheeling the carriage, and cried in panic, “That’s not
our child!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Shut up your big mouth!” he replied. “This is a better
carriage.”</p><p><br></p><p>People are living in greed. Kamal, it will be difficult to be the
first! Even to be aware that you are greedy is a good sign: it is a
beginning, a good beginning, if you become aware of it. And remember,
don’t become guilty about it because that is a way of losing your
awareness again. Don’t start repenting of it because repenting means you
are thinking about the past, which is no more. Don’t start trying to be
non-greedy because whatsoever you do will be greed-even the effort to be
nongreedy will only be rooted in greed. One can become so greedy about
being non-greedy!</p><p><br></p><p>I have seen people who have become so greedy about being non-greedy
that they go on and on renouncing this and that. Their greed has taken a
new turn: it is standing upside down, it is doing a sirshasan, a
headstand. Now they are greedy about non-greed; non-greed has become
their possession, their money, their power. Now they are respected for
their non-greed. They were respected first for their money; now they are
respected for renouncing the money. Now they go on renouncing as much as
they can - to the fullest extreme. They can renounce clothes, they can
stand naked. They can renounce everything, but deep down the greed is
there, they are still greedy. It is simply greed and nothing else. Now
they are hoping that they will be rewarded in paradise - a great reward
is waiting for them.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t try to become non-greedy. A greedy person cannot do anything
about greed. And that’s so about other things also. An angry person
trying to be nonangry is not going to change his being. A violent person
trying to be non-violent will still remain violent; his violence will
now take subtle forms.</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing that is possible is to be conscious of your greed. And
I am not saying that you will be rewarded in paradise, I am not saying
anything about the future. I am simply saying that if you become aware
of greed it disappears. And when it disappears, life is bliss here and
now - not in the future, not as a reward.</p><p><br></p><p>Greed cripples you, anger cripples you, violence cripples you. When
they all disappear<span class=s4></span>And</p><p>they all disappear through one method. A single method is enough -
meditation is enough. All the diseases disappear through taking a single
medicine.</p><p>The words “medicine” and “meditation” come from the same root.
Meditation is the ultimate medicine: it cures you of all ills.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember Yoka again. He says: Don’t cut the branches, cut the
root.</p><p><br></p><p>Unconsciousness is the root, Kamal. Cut the root, be conscious, and
then, herenow, you are a new person. Herenow, your life is transformed,
you become luminous, you radiate bliss, you radiate benediction, you
become paradise.</p><p><br></p><p>Wherever a man of awareness moves there is paradise. You cannot send
a man of bliss, of awareness, of meditation, of satori, to hell, because
if he reaches hell hell will be paradise for him. And you cannot send an
unconscious man into paradise because wherever he is he will find his
hell. If it is not there he will invent his hell - his unconsciousness
will project his hell.</p><p><br></p><p>Reduced to a simple principle, the whole philosophy of all the
awakened ones is: Unconsciousness is hell, consciousness is heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>The seventh question Question 7</p><p>OSHO, I WAS BORN ON FEBRUARY 29TH, HENCE MY BIRTHDAY COMES ONLY ONCE
IN FOUR YEARS. IS THERE SOME SIGNIFICANCE IN IT?</p><p><br></p><p>Gandharva,</p><p><br></p><p>JANUARY OR FEBRUARY OR MARCH February 28th or 29th - these are all
arbitrary. These are our imposed ideas. Existence knows nothing of
February, March. Even if you were born on April 1st there is no
significance in it! You will not be a bigger fool than you are, you will
be the same. What significance can February 29th have? But people want
some significance.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about only one accident that has happened on February

serious phenomenon! Discourse is something religious, holy, sacred. It
is delivered in churches, temples. This place is not a church. This
place belongs to the drunkards - it is a pub! What discourse? I have
never delivered any discourse. Yes, I gossip, that is true, but there is
no gospel in it and there is no art, no secret in it. It is very simple
- my method is very simple.</p><p><br></p><p>A great emperor was passing through a village. He was one of the most
famous warriors of those days and he was a lover of archery. He loved
the people who were perfect archers. Passing through the village he saw
on many trees, lampposts, and garden fences, arrows sticking exactly in
the middle of circles - exactly in the middle, at the centers, of
circles. So many arrows everywhere... he was surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>He asked, “Who is this man? I have never seen such a perfect archer!
His aim is perfect, he never misses, not even by a fragment of an inch.
The arrow always goes exactly into the center. Each target is a proof of
it.” He stopped his chariot, he called the people of the village. He
said, “Who is this man?”</p><p><br></p><p>And they all laughed and said, “Don’t be worried about him. He is a
madman!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “What do you mean by madman? He may be mad, but he is the
greatest archer I have seen.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “It is nothing to do with archery. He knows nothing about
archery.” The king said, “But then it is a puzzle. How does he
manage?”</p><p>They said, “It is simple. First he shoots the arrow at the tree and
then he goes and makes a circle around it!”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s exactly my method. It is simple! Hence you can ask anything.
Whatsoever I want to say, I say it. First I shoot the arrow and then I
draw a circle around it - just as a finishing touch!</p><p><br></p><p>A parish priest was having a few words with his bishop and in the
course of conversation said, “It’s all right for you, my Lord. When you
prepare a sermon you can deliver it to several churches in the diocese,
but I have to give two new sermons every Sunday.”</p><p><br></p><p>The bishop replied, “You should be able to give a sermon on almost
any subject at a moment’s notice, as I can.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I’ll take you up on that,” said the parson. “You come to my church
next Sunday and I will put you to the test.”</p><p><br></p><p>The bishop agreed and in due course went to the pulpit to find a card
with the one word “constipation” written on it. Without hesitation he
started, “And Moses took two tablets and went out onto the mountain
side.”</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

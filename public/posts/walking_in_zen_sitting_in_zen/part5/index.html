SO WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WITNESS AND A THOUGHT OF THE WITNESS?\nSatyendra Saraswati,\nWITNESSING IS NOT A THOUGHT but you can start thinking about witnessing, you can make it a thought. The moment you make it a thought, it is no longer witnessing. Either it is witnessing or it is a thought, it cannot be both together.\nWhen you are witnessing you are not thinking that you are witnessing. If you are thinking that you are witnessing, this is not witnessing at all, it is another kind of thought. If the witnessing is simple, there is no thought of witnessing at all. If the thoughts are just passing in front of your vision and you are witnessing them, and no idea arises in you that “I am witnessing,” then it is pure witnessing. It is not a thought at all, it is a state of no-thought, no-mind. You are simply reflecting whatsoever is passing by.\nThe moment you say, “Aha! This is witnessing. So I am witnessing. This is what meditation is. This is awareness,” you have missed the point. You have fallen back into the mud of the mind. You are no longer a witness. You have become identified. Witnessing cannot be reduced to a thought.\nBut your problem is significant. It is encountered by almost every meditator. We have become so habituated to witnessing in a wrong way. We think that we witness. We judge, we evaluate, but we think that we witness. We think that we witness, and it is not witnessing. We are associated with a wrong kind of witnessing, and that idea lingers for a long time.\nSecondly: we have become so conditioned to immediately reducing every experience into a thought. We never allow any experience to remain just a pure experience, even for a few moments.\nYou come across a beautiful rose flower in the garden. The moment you see it, almost instantly you say inside, “How beautiful!” You can’t let that beauty sink in. The thought of beauty becomes a barrier. The moment you say, “How beautiful!” you have already started comparing it with other roses that you have seen in the past. You have started comparing it with all that you have heard about roses. You are no longer seeing this rose. You are missing its suchness. You have gone into the past. You are searching in your memory to discover how many roses you have seen before: “And this is the best one.” But this rose is no longer there in your awareness. Your awareness has become very clouded. So much smoke has come from the past, so much dust has arisen that your mirror is no longer reflecting the beauty. You are not now-here.\nAllow the rose and its fragrance and its beauty and its dance in the wind and the sun to penetrate you. Don’t bring your mind in. There is no need to say that this is beautiful. If it is, there is no need to say it; if it is not, then it is false to say it. Either it is or it is not. To create a thought about it in any way is to create ripples in your consciousness. It is like throwing a pebble into a silent lake. Just a moment ago it was reflecting the moon and the stars so beautifully, and your pebble has created ripples, and the moon and the stars have all become distorted.\nThat’s what happens whenever a thought arises in you: your consciousness is disturbed, starts wavering. Waves start arising in you. Now you are not capable of reflecting that which is.\nYou will have to learn this new art of seeing things without judging, of seeing things without verbalizing, of seeing things without evaluating. See the rose, see the bird on the wing, see the night full of stars, see the river passing by, see the traffic. Listen to the songs of the birds or a train passing by. Start learning a new art of just being reflective, not bringing any thought in, not saying anything at all.\nIt will take a little time – old habits die hard – but one day it happens. If you persist, if you are patient enough, if you go on and on working at cleaning your inner world, one day it happens. And the benediction of that day is immense. In fact, that day you are born anew. You start seeing the same world with new eyes because your eyes are so clear, your mirror reflects so deeply, so totally, without distortion, that trees – the same trees that you have seen before thousands of times – are far more green than they have ever been. And their greenness is no ordinary greenness: it is luminous, it is radiating light.\nIt is the same world, the same peopleA Buddha walks, a Jesus walks in the same world – the\nsame trees, the same rocks, the same people, the same sky – but they live in paradise and you live in hell. The difference is created by the mind.\nIt will take a little while to drop this mind. It has dominated you for so long that it is difficult in the\nbeginning to suddenly disassociate yourself from it. It clings. It can’t leave its power over you so easily. Hence it goes on coming in from the back door.\nYou are sitting silently and a beautiful stillness arises, and the mind comes in from the back door and says, “Look, how beautiful this moment is!” And it has taken you away! It came so silently, without making any noise, and you were caught by it in such a subtle way that you could not have been aware of it. You rejoiced, you thanked the mind... but it has destroyed your stillness.\nWhen stillness is really true there is no mind to say anything about it. When witnessing is true you are simply a witness-. You don’t think, “I am witnessing.” There is no “I,” there is no thinking, there is only the witness, because all thinking, and the “I” – they have all become contents, objects of your witnessing. And witnessing itself cannot be its own object. No mirror can reflect itself. Your eyes cannot see themselves. Your witness cannot witness itself, that’s impossible.\nYour question is relevant. And you will have to be very very careful, watchful. It is a razor’s edge. One has to be very cautious because if you fall, you fall into a deep abyss. The ordinary people cannot fall; they have nowhere to fall to – they are already at the bottom. But as you start moving higher, the possibility of falling down grows every day. When you reach the Everest of your consciousness, just a little slip, just a little wrong step, and you will go rolling down into a deep abyss.\nThe greater the meditation, the greater the danger of losing it – naturally; only a rich man can be robbed, not a poor man. That’s why a beggar can sleep under a tree in the afternoon and the noise of the traffic and the marketplace... nothing disturbs him. He can sleep anywhere, he can sleep deeply. He has nothing to lose – no fear.\nOnce, at night, a king came across a very strange man, a very luminous man, standing alert underneath a tree – so silent, so quiet and so alert. The king was curious: “Why is he standing there?” From his appearance he looked like a monk, one who has renounced the world. The king was a very cultured man and he thought, “It is not right to disturb him.” But every night it happened.\nThat was the routine of the king: to go around the capital at night in disguise to see how things were going – whether the guards were on duty or not; mixing and meeting with people, going into the hotels and the theaters to find out how things were going – whether things were all right or not.\nEvery night he would come across this man. He saw this man so many times that it became impossible to resist the temptation. One day he approached him and asked, “Excuse me, sir, I should not interfere – you look so silent – but why do you go on standing the whole night? What are you guarding? Is there any treasure underneath this tree?”\nThe mystic laughed. He said, “Not underneath this tree, but within me there is a treasure and I am watching it. And the treasure is growing every day, it is becoming bigger and bigger, hence I have to be more and more alert.”\nThe mystic said to the king, “You can sleep, you have nothing to lose. I cannot, I have much to lose; and if I can remain awake I have much to gain.”\nThe king was very much impressed. He asked him to come to his palace, he invited him. The monk agreed. The king was a little puzzled: a monk agreeing so soon without even refusing once is not\nthought to be right. A monk should say, “No, I cannot come to the palace. I have renounced the world. It is all futile. It is all dream, illusion, maya I cannot come back to the world. I am happy wherever I am.”\nBut this monk didn’t say anything. He was a Zen Master. The king started thinking in his mind, “Have I been deceived by this man? Was he simply standing there every night just to catch hold of me?”\nBut now it was too late; he had invited him.\nThe mystic came to the palace, lived with the king. And, of course, he lived more joyously than the king because he had no worries, no cares about the empire, no problems and no anxieties. He enjoyed good food, and the king had given him the best room in the palace – he lived just like an emperor!\nSix months passed. Now the king was boiling within himself to ask him, “What kind of renunciation is this? You are enjoying everything – servants and good food and good clothes and a beautiful palace.”\nOne day, walking in the garden, he asked the mystic, “Can I ask you a question? Forgive me if you feel offended. This is my question: What is the difference now between me and you?”\nThe mystic looked at the king and he said, “Why did you wait for six months? This question you could have asked me the very first night. The moment you invited me and I accepted your invitation, this question arose in your mind. Why did you wait for six months? You tortured yourself unnecessarily. I was expecting it at any moment. There is no question of my feeling offended – it is a natural question.\n“There is a difference, but it is very subtle. And if you really want to know the difference, then come with me. I cannot tell you here. I will tell you in a certain space, at a certain place. Come along with me.”\nThey both went outside the city. The king said, “Now can you tell me?” The mystic said, “Come along.”\nWhen they were crossing the boundary of his empire – it was evening – the king said,’What are you doing? Where are you taking me? Now this is the end of my empire. We are entering somebody else’s kingdom and I would like to be answered. What is your answer? And I am feeling very tired.”\nAnd the mystic said, “My answer is that I am going. Are you coming with me or not? I am not going back.”\nThe king said, “How can I come with you? I have my whole empire, my wife, my children. How can I come with you?”\nThe mystic said, “That’s the difference. But I am going!”\nAgain the king saw the light, the beauty of the man, and fell at his feet. He said, “Come back! I am just stupid. I have missed these six months. I have been thinking things which are really ugly. Forgive me and come back.”\nThe mystic said, “There is no problem for me. I can come back, but you will again think the same. It is better for me now to go ahead – that story is finished, that chapter is closed – so that you can remember the difference.”\nThe witness lives in the world just like a mirror, reflecting everything. He may be in a hut, he may be in a palace; it makes no difference. What difference does it make to a mirror whether the mirror is in a hut or in a palace? What difference does it make to the mirror whether the mirror is reflecting beautiful diamonds or just ordinary stones? It makes no difference to the mirror.\nWitnessing is the art of transcending the world. Witnessing is the very essence of Zen, of religion itself. But don’t make it a thought – it is not a thought at all. Thoughts have to be witnessed. Even if the thought of witnessing arises, witness that thought. Remember that it is not witnessing, it is only a thought – it has to be witnessed. It is there in front of you. You are not it.\nThe witness is irreducible to any thought; it always goes on sliding back. You cannot catch hold of it through any thought. It can witness each and every thought, the thought of witnessing included; hence, it can never itself become a thought.\nNext time when you are meditating, Satyendra Saraswati, remember it. Don’t start enjoying the thought that “This is a beautiful moment. My mind is silent, my being is still. This is witnessing!” The moment you say it, you have lost it.\nThe second question Question 2\nOSHO,\nPLEASE SAY SOMETHING MORE ABOUT THE MAN OF ZEN.\nPratibha,\nTHE MAN OF ZEN IS VERY ORDINARY extraordinarily ordinary. He is so ordinary that there is every possibility if you meet him you will not be able to recognize him. He lives just like you, eats like you, sleeps like you. He is in every way just like you. As far as his outside is concerned he is not different from you at all.\nThe difference is certainly there, but that difference is inner. He has an insight, he has a clarity. He has eyes and you are blind. He is awake and you are asleep. You are drunk: drunk with greed, drunk with lust, drunk with anger, ambition, ego.\nThe man of Zen is simply not drunk; he is in his senses. He walks consciously, he sits consciously: “walking in Zen, sitting in Zen.” He is not in any way special. He is not like other so-called saints.\nHe will not lie down on a bed of thorns or on a bed of nails, he will not stand on his head. He is not stupid, he is not an exhibitionist. He will not walk naked in the streets. He is not mad, he is not neurotic! He lives in the very ordinary way, in the very normal way.\nThat’s why it is the most difficult thing to recognize the man of Zen. You can recognize a saint who walks on water – naturally, it is so obvious that he is special. But a man of Zen does not walk on water. He does not perform any miracles. He does not play any kind of egoistic games. He is not an ego, he is not even a person. He is just a presence, a nonentity. He is absolute nothingness. Only when one is absolute nothingness is one full of awareness. Whatsoever he does, he does with totality. Only a man who is not drunk can do things totally. Otherwise one remains partial; only a part goes on doing something and at the same time other parts may be going against it, being destructive. You may be creating something with one hand and destroying it with the other.\nA man who is drunk does not know where he is going. He thinks he is on the right path, but that is only his dreaming.\nBarry Higgins, a traveling salesman, was driving home to London one afternoon after a hard-drinking lunch with a prospective customer. Through the rearview mirror he spied the flashing blue light of a police car behind. A shiver went up his spine and he grasped the steering wheel tightly to steady his driving. The blue light approached, a siren wailed, and a police car overtook him with a hand signalling him to pull to a stop.\nBarry was nervous as he saw the policeman get out of his car. His breath was heavy and his hands were moist on the steering wheel. He wondered what he was going to say.\nThe policeman came up and bent to speak through the car window. “Ay, ay, now then, had a few, eh?”\nBarry could not stop himself and blurted, “Ohh... g... good onsternoon, afterble, I... I’m not as think as you drunk I am!”\nThe man of Zen is absolutely conscious – no greed, no anger, no jealousy, no ambition. These are all intoxicants, these are all drugs: they go on keeping you sleepy. It is a miracle how you manage your life with so many poisons running in your bloodstream, in your very being. That is the only difference; otherwise, from the outside, you will not know.\nThere are other so-called saints who make outside differences because there is no inner difference. They have to stand naked, they have to torture their bodies, they have to go on fasting. They have to distort their bodies, cripple their bodies. They have to do something that makes them more special than you, “holier than thou.”\nA Zen man is not “holier than thou.” He has no idea of being in any way higher than you. He is simply living his nature.\nYoka says: The man of Zen goes alone.\nThat is his first characteristic. He is not part of a mob psychology. He is not Hindu, he is not Mohammedan, he is not Christian, he is not Jewish. He is not Indian, he is not Japanese, he is\nnot Chinese – he cannot be. He never belongs to any crowd. He is alone. He is a rebel. He lives according to his light. He does not follow, he does not imitate. He has reached the goal.\nWhat is the goal? The goal is not somewhere outside you. It is not there, far away like a star; it is within you, it is your own interiority. He has entered his own interiority. And the man who has reached his goal...\n... CAN PLAY ON THE PATH OF NIRVANA.\nHe is playful, he is not serious. He cannot be serious: the whole of life is a divine play, LEELA, and he is part of it. He is just playing a role. He acts the role as beautifully as he can, as perfectly as he can, but he knows that the whole world is a big stage, a great drama – but nothing more. So he is not serious about it.\nTHE MAN OF ZEN HAS NATURAL MANNERS AND IS HARMONIOUS.\nHe does not pretend to be special, he has natural manners. He is very human, utterly human. His humanity is superb, intense, absolute. He does not claim any sacredness – and because he does not claim he is sacred. He is harmonious. He is not divided within himself, he is not in a constant fight with himself, he is not in a constant civil war. He has a melody, a music. If you sit by his side you will be able to listen to the music.\nNavanit asked just the other day: “Osho, whenever I come close to you I immediately smell a certain fragrance. What fragrance is it?” I don’t use any perfume – I cannot. Navanit is a doctor, he knows; hence the question has become more pertinent to him. And he says that he always finds the same fragrance whenever he is close to me.\nThat fragrance has nothing to do with any perfume. It is the fragrance of harmony, it is the music. It expresses itself in a multi-dimensional way. Sometimes you will hear it as a silent sound like a murmur, the wind passing through the pine trees, or the sound of running water. Sometimes you will hear it as music and sometimes you will experience it as a smell, a beautiful fragrance. Sometimes you will see it as an aura, a light, very mysterious.\nBut the man of Zen simply lives in harmony, and out of harmony all these things are manifested.\nHIS SPIRIT IS SIMPLE, CLEAN, PURE AND SINCERE. HIS ZEN, WHICH NO ONE SEES, IS TREASURE BEYOND ALL VALUE.\nYou can see his body, you cannot see his Zen. You cannot see his inner meditativeness, you cannot see his awareness unless you become aware yourself. You can know only that much which you have experienced.\nNavanit, you are blessed that you are experiencing a certain fragrance. That means you are reaching to a certain depth, a certain height in your being.\nHIS ZEN, WHICH NO ONE SEES, IS TREASURE BEYOND ALL VALUE. THIS JEWEL, RARE AND OF INCALCULABLE VALUE, NEVER CHANGES HOWEVER ONE USES IT. AND OTHERS CAN FREELY BENEFIT FROM IT ON ALL OCCASIONS.\nThe man of Zen is always overflowing with joy. You can share it. He is a giver: he gives delight, he gives joy, he gives beauty, he gives truth. He radiates truth, he radiates God, but so silently... without any declaration. He goes on pouring his blessings into existence. He is a blessing to the world.\nThe third question Question 3 OSHO,\nI KNOW MY LOVE STINKS, SO WHY DO I CLING TO THE SMELL?\nPrem Amrito,\nWE LIVE according to the past: our lives are rooted in the dead past, we are conditioned by the past. The past is very powerful, that’s why you go on living in a certain pattern; even if it stinks, you will go on repeating it. You don’t know what else to do; you have become conditioned to it. It is a mechanical phenomenon. And this is not only so with you, Amrito, it is so with almost every human being – unless he becomes a Buddha.\nTo become a Buddha means to get rid of the past and to live in the present. The past is immense, very huge, enormous, of millions of lives. You have lived in a certain way. Now, being here, you may have become aware that your love stinks, but that awareness is also not very deep, it is very superficial. If it becomes really deep, if it penetrates to the very core of your being, you will immediately jump out of it.\nIt is like if your house is on fire you will not ask anybody how to get out of it. You will not consult the ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA, and you will not wait for some wise man to come and tell you, and you will not consider whether it is appropriate to jump out of the window or not – you won’t bother about anything. Even if you are taking a bath naked you will jump naked out of the window; you won’t even bother about clothes. When the house is on fire, your life is at risk; now everything else is secondary. If your love stinks – this has become your experience – then you will come out of it. You will not simply ask a question, you will jump out of it.\nBut I think that it is just an intellectual idea, because each time you are in love, some misery arises. Each time there is some conflict, some struggle, some fight, some jealousy, some possessiveness. So you have started taking an intellectual standpoint: “My love stinks, so why do I cling to the smell?” Because it is not yet really an existential experience for you.\nAnd it is your own smell. One becomes accustomed to one’s own smell. That’s why when people are alone they don’t experience that smell, they experience it only when they are together with somebody.\nWhen you are in love, then you start showing your real face. Love is a mirror. The other starts functioning a mirror. Every relationship becomes a mirror. Alone, you don’t experience your own smell – you cannot; one becomes immune to it. You have lived with it so long, how can you smell it? It is only with the other that you start feeling that he stinks and he starts feeling that you stink. And the fight startsThat is the story of all the couples all over the world.\n“Where are you going with that goat, Juan?” asked the policeman. “I’m taking him home to keep as a pet!” replied Juan.\n“In the house?” “Sure thing.”\n“But what about the smell?”\n“So what? He ain’t gonna mind the smell!”\nYour own smell is not disturbing to you. In fact, if it suddenly disappears you will feel a little jolted, you will feel a little uprooted, you will not feel your natural self; you will feel something has gone wrong.\nIf you love and there is no jealousy you will start wondering whether you love or not. What kind of love is this? There seems to be no jealousy! You love a man, and if the man goes with another woman once in a while, you don’t make much fuss about it. You take it for granted – it is perfectly good for a change. And if your man is happy, why not let him be happy? You love him. If you really love him you will respect his happiness too. And he is not going forever.\nIn fact, if once in a while couples are allowed a little freedom, they will not separate; the divorce rate will drop in the world. Divorce exists only because marriage is too tight. Let marriage be a little more relaxed and divorce will disappear. Divorce is only a by-product of marriage. The tighter the marriage system, the more divorce becomes an absolute need. And if divorce is not allowed, then you have double lives: one to show to the society and one to live.\nIt is because of marriage that prostitution exists in the world. The whole blame goes to the marriage system. If people are a little more loving and less jealous and if they understand human nature, it is simple.\nYou eat the same food every day; you get fed up with it and once in a while you would like to go to the hotel. And the hotel food may be worse than what you get in your home, but even that is good – at least that makes your home food look better. And when you come back the next day you feel so relieved that you are back home, and you are so happy to have the same food again!\nThe more man’s mind is understood, the more and more marriage will have to be relaxed. It is perfectly okay to give a few days off in marriage. The woman should be allowed to have her boyfriends and the man should be allowed to have his girlfriends – at least, just as you have Sunday religion, a Sunday marriage! And you will be surprised that your own wife looks far better. Again a honeymoon starts – a mini-honeymoon. You again start from ABC.\nAnd being with many women and with many men does not destroy marriage – no, not at all. It is a very nonsensical idea that has prevailed over humanity: that it is destructive to marriage and family. It is not so – it is very supportive. It will help the family to be more joyous, less quarrelsome. Otherwise, the woman is constantly spying on the husband and the husband is constantly spying\non the woman. And what love can exist between two persons who are constantly at each other’s throats?\nYes, your love stinks, as everybody else’s love stinks, but you feel it only when you are in relationship. You have not yet felt that it really has something to do with you. Deep down you still feel it must be something wrong with the other. That’s how the mind functions: it throws the responsibility on the other. It accepts itself and it is always finding faults in others.\nSeveral people are sitting in the front row of a movie theater. The show has already begun when suddenly there is a terrible smell.\nOne of the spectators turns to the man sitting beside him and asks, “Did you shit in your trousers?” The man beside him answers, “Yes, why?”\nPeople accept themselves totally! Whatsoever they are doing is right: “Why? What is wrong in it? They are his own trousers, so who are you to interfere? And freedom is everybody’s birthright!”\nAmrito, if your love stinks, then try to find out what exactly it is that stinks. It is not love, it is something else. Love itself has a fragrance; it can’t stink, it is a lotus flower. Something else must be in it – jealousy, possessiveness. But you have not mentioned jealousy and possessiveness. You are hiding them. Love never stinks, it cannot; that is not the nature of love. Please try to see exactly what it is that creates the trouble. And I am not saying to repress it. All that is needed is a clarity about it – what it is.\nIf it is jealousy, then I would only suggest one thing: be more watchful of your jealousy. When it arises next time, rather than becoming mad, close your doors, sit silently, sit in meditation, watch your jealousy. See exactly what it is. It will surround you like smoke, dirty smoke. It will suffocate you. You would like to go out and do something. But don’t do anything; just be in a state of non- doing, because anything done in a moment of jealousy is going to be destructive. Just watch. And I am not saying repress it, because that is again doing something.\nPeople are either expressive or repressive, and both ways are wrong. If you express you become destructive to the other person. Whosoever is your victim suffers, and he is going to take revenge. He may not take revenge consciously, but unconsciously it is going to happen.\nJust a few months ago, Krishna Bharti fell in love with a woman. Nothing extraordinary about it, but Deeksha got mad! Deeksha could not accept the idea. For centuries we have been told that if a man loves you or a woman loves you and the man or the woman goes to somebody else, that is a rejection of you.\nThat is utter nonsense. It is not rejection; in fact, it is just the opposite. If a man loves the woman and he enjoys the woman, he starts fantasizing how it will be with other women. It is really the joy that this woman has given him that triggers his fancy. It is not that he is rejecting this woman; it is really an indication that this woman has been such a nourishment that he would like to see and know how other women are. And if a little rope is given he is not going to go very far, he will come back, because with the other woman it may be novelty, it will be something new, but it can’t be that\nnourishing because there will not be any intimacy. It will have something empty about it. It will be sex without love.\nLove needs time to grow, it needs intimacy to grow. It needs a really long time. It is not a seasonal flower that is there within three, four weeks, but then within three, four weeks it is gone too. It is a long long process of intimacy. Slowly slowly, two persons melt and merge into each other; then it becomes nourishing. The other woman or the other man cannot be nourishing. It may be just an adventure, a thrill. But then suddenly the feeling will arise – it is bound to arise – that it is good as fun, but it is not nourishing. And the person will be back.\nAnd Krishna Bharti would have been back, but Deeksha went mad. She behaved just like any other woman! But I was waiting... sooner or later she was going to take revenge. Now she is taking revenge. Krishna Bharti fell ill, he was in hospital, and Deeksha had a little freedom. She fell in love with her own handyman! He really proved handy! Now K.B. is in hell.\nThere is no need to be so worried about it. I have given K.B. a message: “Wait, don’t be worried. Just let her take revenge. And it is good that unconscious burden is finished.”\nIf we understand each other a little more, if we understand human nature a little more, there should be no jealousy. But it is a past heritage of centuries.\nSo, Amrito, I cannot say you can drop it right now. You will have to meditate over it. Whenever it possesses you, meditate over it. Slowly slowly, the meditation will create the distance between you and the jealousy. And the greater the distance, the less jealousy will arise. And one day, when there is no jealousy, your love releases such a fragrance that no flower can compete with it. All flowers are poor compared to the flowering of love.\nBut your love is crippled because of jealousy and possessiveness and anger.\nIt is not love that stinks, remember, because I have seen people who think it is love that stinks so they close up, they become closed, they stop loving.\nThat’s what has happened to millions of monks and nuns down the ages: they became closed to love, they dropped the whole idea of love. Rather than dropping jealousy, which would have been a revolution, rather than dropping possessiveness, which would have been something of immense value, they dropped love. That is easy, that is not much; anybody can do that. To be a monk or a nun is very easy, but to love and not to be jealous, to love and not to be possessive, to love and let the other have the whole freedom is really a great achievement. Only then will you feel love and its fragrance.\nThe fourth question Question 4\nOSHO, WHAT DO YOU THINK? IS JESUS COMING BACK TO EARTH AGAIN AS HE HAD PROMISED OR NOT?\nSujata,\nONCE A MAN becomes awakened he cannot come back. He promises out of his compassion, but it is not possible. It is not possible because it is against the law of life. Jesus has promised to come back, Buddha also has promised to come back, Krishna has also promised to come back. Nobody has come yet and nobody is going to come back. It is against the law of life. They promise because of their compassion, their love. They promise because they see your misery, they see your sad state of affairs, they see your tears. So they promise, and their promise fulfils a certain purpose. Because of their promise you go on remembering them and that remembrance helps you. Because of their promise you go on connecting yourself to them, surrendering to them, and that surrendering helps. But they cannot fulfil their promise.\nOnce a man is awakened there is no possibility of his being born again. One can be born only if something in him has still remained unconscious. Life is an opportunity to become conscious. It is a school, a training school, where people become centered, rooted, integrated. Once they have become integrated, once they have attained self-realization, they cannot be allowed back into the school. They disappear into the universal. They become part of God.\nSo the first thing to be remembered: Jesus, Krishna or Buddha cannot come, but that does not mean that awakened people will not be there. There will be people like Jesus, like Buddha, like Krishna – of the same quality. Maybe their faces will not be the same and their bodies may not be the same.…\nAnd who would like to have a body like Jesus? You don’t know about Jesus, that’s why. He was only four feet five inches, and a hunchback! And it is said in the old scriptures that he was the ugliest man who has walked on the earth. Who would like to have his body?\nBut his disciples have said he was the most beautiful man. They saw his beauty; that is of the inner, hence there is no contradiction. The disciples saw the inner. They saw the real Jesus, the pillar of his consciousness. They saw his interiority. They communed with his being. And, yes, there has never been such a beautiful man.\nBut the others saw only his body; the others could not see his soul, the others could not see his Zen. Only his disciples could see his Zen, his meditativeness, his love. Only his disciples could feel who he was, his divineness. They could say, “He is the most beautiful man who has ever walked on the earth.”\nAnd the descriptions are so contradictory that it has been a problem for the historians how to decide what is right. Both are right; there is no need to decide. It is not a question of choosing this or that.\nAnd, in the second place, even if it were possible for him to come back, do you think he is mad? What did you do with him when he was here? Just remember it: you tortured him as you have never tortured anybody else before him.\nSocrates’ death was not a torture. He was given poison and within minutes he was dead. His death was a silent one.\nThe way Jesus was crucified is one of the most violent ways... sometimes it takes three days for the person to die. Just nailing a man on a cross cannot kill him immediately. Blood starts oozing from his body slowly slowly. Life starts oozing out, but very slowly. Even the weakest man will take\nat least six to eighteen hours to die, and if the man is healthy he can take even three days or more. This is real hell! This is real torture!\nHe was dying on the cross, and people were throwing stones and abuse. Soldiers were poking their spears into his body, and blood was coming out of his body. He was alive, he was thirsty, and they would not give him water. He was crying for water. And one hundred thousand people had gathered to see this torture.\nWhat did you do with Jesus when he was here? I think that was enough to keep him away from this earth forever!\nA new arrival knocked on heaven’s door. Jesus was on duty and opened the door. “Who are you?” he asked.\n“Adolf Hitler,” came the reply.\n“Adolf Hitler! You cannot come here. You are a megalomaniac bent on world domination. Get away!” “But I want to mend my ways!”\n“No way! Get out!”\n“Ah, if you will let me in, I will give you something.” “Well,” said Jesus, weakening a little, “what is it?”\nHitler, in dress uniform, pulled off his special Iron Cross and showed it to Jesus. “Well,” he asked, “can I come in?”\n“You just wait here. I’ll go and ask my dad.”\nJesus found God in his study. “Dad, there’s a newcomer at the gate who wants to come in.” “Who is he?”\n“Adolf Hitler.”\n“Adolf Hitler! That megalomaniac bent on world domination? He can’t come in here!” “But he has something very special to give me.”\n“What is it?” “His Iron Cross.”\nGod thumped his chair. “What do you need an iron cross for? Hell, you couldn’t even carry that wooden one!”\nYou forced poor Jesus to carry his own cross. He was weak; he had not slept the whole night – the whole night he was tortured and questioned and investigated. And then he had to carry that big wooden cross. He fell thrice on the road under the burden of the cross. He was hurt and wounded, but the soldiers whipped him again and forced him to carry his cross.\nHe was only thirty-three years old. He had not seen much of life yet; in fact, it was just the beginning. Had he lived as long as Buddha, the world would have been enriched far more. Buddha lived eighty- four years, Mahavira lived eighty years, Krishna almost the same age. They died at a ripe old age. They saw the whole of life with all its ups and downs, success and failure, misery and joy, ecstasy and agony. They became mature and ripe. They could give to the world something immensely valuable.\nJesus was allowed only three years. He started his ministry when he was thirty years old and he was killed when he was thirty-three. Just three years! He could not do much. He could have done great work for humanity, but we killed him. And now we are waiting for his next coming.\nAnd if he comes you will do the same again, because you are doing the same again to people of that quality, of that insight. You have always been behaving as inhumanly as possible with the Buddhas.\nJesus is a Buddha. That is exactly the meaning of the word “Christ.” “Christ” and “Buddha” are synonymous. Buddha means the awakened one, Christ means the crowned one. It is awakening that becomes your crowning, that makes you an emperor, that takes all suffering away from you and gives you the kingdom of God.\nNo, even if he could come he will not decide to come.\nAnd man has not learned anything. After Jesus, you did the same with Al-Hillaj Mansur. Even more ugly was the behavior with Al-Hillaj Mansur. And the same is the attitude of the masses even today. Nothing has changed. Man seems to be stagnant, stubborn, just living an unconscious life and repeating it.\nBut, Sujata, why should you be waiting? You can find the awakened ones any time; they are always available. Fortunately, there is always somebody who is a Buddha. And those who are real seekers are bound to find him because he is also seeking and searching for the real seekers. It is not a one-way search.\nIf you have come here in search of me, I am also searching in my own way for you. It is not one-way. If you are here, you are here only because I have invited you to be here. You are here only because I have called you forth to be here.\nNow don’t waste your time thinking about whether Jesus will come or not. What do you want with Jesus? I am ready to give you all that Jesus can give to you. Be receptive, be surrendered, because he will ask for the same conditions to be fulfilled. He cannot just deliver you as you are; you will have to fulfil a few conditions. You will have to drop your ego; that is the basic requirement. Fulfil that.\nAnd I am your Jesus. Of course, the body is different, the mind is different, but the consciousness is never different. Two awakened persons are exactly the same. They belong to the same dimension, the same fragrance, the same harmony, the same bliss, the same godliness.\nThe fifth question Question 5 OSHO,\nIS THERE A PLACE FOR COMPETITIVE SPORT IN THE NEW COMMUNE?\nAnand Murti,\nIN THE NEW COMMUNE there will be a new organization called “Athletics Anonymous.” When you get the urge to play golf, baseball, or anything else involving physical activity, someone will be sent over to drink with you until the urge passes.\nThe sixth question Question 6\nOSHO, I AM A JEW, ITALIAN, AND A PSYCHOLOGIST! IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR ME?\nAnand Shravan,\nYOU ARE REALLY FORTUNATE! There is every hope for you; in fact, you cannot miss. Even if you want to miss you cannot, because the Jew is going to kill the poor Italian, and the psychologist is going to kill the poor Jew, and when there is nothing left for the psychologist, they almost always tend to commit suicide!\nAnd the last question Question 7\nOSHO,\nARE YOU PUSHING MY PLEASURE BUTTON? WHEN I SIT IN LECTURE I AM ALL SMILES AND IT TAKES ME HOURS TO WIPE IT OFF MY FACE.\nParmita,\nYOU FOOL! Why do you try to wipe it off? I make so much effort to create it and you take hours to wipe it off! Never do it again – so that it becomes something permanent, something essential with you, something natural, something that surrounds you.\nBut I know people are afraid of smiling, because if you are caught red-handed by others smiling for no reason at all, they think you are crazy. So people repress their smiles. That’s why Parmita must have been trying to wipe it off.\nBut when I push the button I really push the button, and now I am going to push harder! You will not be able to wipe it off even if you make effort for hours or for days! Enjoy it! And what does it matter if\npeople think you are crazy? Why be worried about it? There is nothing wrong in being crazy. Here, at least, everything is crazy!\nJust the other day somebody asked, “Osho, there are so many clocks in the ashram. Why do they all show different times?” Just crazy – cuckoo clocks! And if they all show the same time, then what would be the need for so many clocks? Then one would be enough!\nParmita, one joke for you:\nA young nurse’s first duty on her new job was to bathe the man in room 305. She performed her task and quickly returned to the nursing station.\n“How was he?” asked her supervisor, an old, seasoned nurse.\n“He was doing fine,” she said, “but there was a very strange thing... he had the word’little’ tattooed on his prick.”\nThe older nurse was very curious and decided to check it out. She returned forty-five minutes later, hair messed up, clothes askew, and said to the young nurse, “Honey, that tattoo does not say ‘little.’ It says, ‘Little Rock, Arkansas, Pride of the South’!”\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7842","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/walking_in_zen_sitting_in_zen/part5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/walking_in_zen_sitting_in_zen/>Walking in Zen, Sitting in Zen</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">5 Playing On The Path</h1><div class=post-meta>37 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7842 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Walking_in_Zen_Sitting_in_Zen/part5.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WITNESS AND A THOUGHT OF THE
WITNESS?</p><p><br></p><p>Satyendra Saraswati,</p><p><br></p><p>WITNESSING IS NOT A THOUGHT but you can start thinking about
witnessing, you can make it a thought. The moment you make it a thought,
it is no longer witnessing. Either it is witnessing or it is a thought,
it cannot be both together.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are witnessing you are not thinking that you are witnessing.
If you are thinking that you are witnessing, this is not witnessing at
all, it is another kind of thought. If the witnessing is simple, there
is no thought of witnessing at all. If the thoughts are just passing in
front of your vision and you are witnessing them, and no idea arises in
you that “I am witnessing,” then it is pure witnessing. It is not a
thought at all, it is a state of no-thought, no-mind. You are simply
reflecting whatsoever is passing by.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment you say, “Aha! This is witnessing. So I am witnessing.
This is what meditation is. This is awareness,” you have missed the
point. You have fallen back into the mud of the mind. You are no longer
a witness. You have become identified. Witnessing cannot be reduced to a
thought.</p><p>But your problem is significant. It is encountered by almost every
meditator. We have become so habituated to witnessing in a wrong way. We
think that we witness. We judge, we evaluate, but we think that we
witness. We think that we witness, and it is not witnessing. We are
associated with a wrong kind of witnessing, and that idea lingers for a
long time.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly: we have become so conditioned to immediately reducing every
experience into a thought. We never allow any experience to remain just
a pure experience, even for a few moments.</p><p><br></p><p>You come across a beautiful rose flower in the garden. The moment you
see it, almost instantly you say inside, “How beautiful!” You can’t let
that beauty sink in. The thought of beauty becomes a barrier. The moment
you say, “How beautiful!” you have already started comparing it with
other roses that you have seen in the past. You have started comparing
it with all that you have heard about roses. You are no longer seeing
this rose. You are missing its suchness. You have gone into the past.
You are searching in your memory to discover how many roses you have
seen before: “And this is the best one.” But this rose is no longer
there in your awareness. Your awareness has become very clouded. So much
smoke has come from the past, so much dust has arisen that your mirror
is no longer reflecting the beauty. You are not now-here.</p><p><br></p><p>Allow the rose and its fragrance and its beauty and its dance in the
wind and the sun to penetrate you. Don’t bring your mind in. There is no
need to say that this is beautiful. If it is, there is no need to say
it; if it is not, then it is false to say it. Either it is or it is not.
To create a thought about it in any way is to create ripples in your
consciousness. It is like throwing a pebble into a silent lake. Just a
moment ago it was reflecting the moon and the stars so beautifully, and
your pebble has created ripples, and the moon and the stars have all
become distorted.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what happens whenever a thought arises in you: your
consciousness is disturbed, starts wavering. Waves start arising in you.
Now you are not capable of reflecting that which is.</p><p><br></p><p>You will have to learn this new art of seeing things without judging,
of seeing things without verbalizing, of seeing things without
evaluating. See the rose, see the bird on the wing, see the night full
of stars, see the river passing by, see the traffic. Listen to the songs
of the birds or a train passing by. Start learning a new art of just
being reflective, not bringing any thought in, not saying anything at
all.</p><p><br></p><p>It will take a little time – old habits die hard – but one day it
happens. If you persist, if you are patient enough, if you go on and on
working at cleaning your inner world, one day it happens. And the
benediction of that day is immense. In fact, that day you are born anew.
You start seeing the same world with new eyes because your eyes are so
clear, your mirror reflects so deeply, so totally, without distortion,
that trees – the same trees that you have seen before thousands of times
– are far more green than they have ever been. And their greenness is no
ordinary greenness: it is luminous, it is radiating light.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the same world, the same people<span class=s4></span>A Buddha
walks, a Jesus walks in the same world – the</p><p>same trees, the same rocks, the same people, the same sky – but they
live in paradise and you live in hell. The difference is created by the
mind.</p><p><br></p><p>It will take a little while to drop this mind. It has dominated you
for so long that it is difficult in the</p><p>beginning to suddenly disassociate yourself from it. It clings. It
can’t leave its power over you so easily. Hence it goes on coming in
from the back door.</p><p><br></p><p>You are sitting silently and a beautiful stillness arises, and the
mind comes in from the back door and says, “Look, how beautiful this
moment is!” And it has taken you away! It came so silently, without
making any noise, and you were caught by it in such a subtle way that
you could not have been aware of it. You rejoiced, you thanked the
mind... but it has destroyed your stillness.</p><p><br></p><p>When stillness is really true there is no mind to say anything about
it. When witnessing is true you are simply a witness-. You don’t think,
“I am witnessing.” There is no “I,” there is no thinking, there is only
the witness, because all thinking, and the “I” – they have all become
contents, objects of your witnessing. And witnessing itself cannot be
its own object. No mirror can reflect itself. Your eyes cannot see
themselves. Your witness cannot witness itself, that’s impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>Your question is relevant. And you will have to be very very careful,
watchful. It is a razor’s edge. One has to be very cautious because if
you fall, you fall into a deep abyss. The ordinary people cannot fall;
they have nowhere to fall to – they are already at the bottom. But as
you start moving higher, the possibility of falling down grows every
day. When you reach the Everest of your consciousness, just a little
slip, just a little wrong step, and you will go rolling down into a deep
abyss.</p><p><br></p><p>The greater the meditation, the greater the danger of losing it –
naturally; only a rich man can be robbed, not a poor man. That’s why a
beggar can sleep under a tree in the afternoon and the noise of the
traffic and the marketplace... nothing disturbs him. He can sleep
anywhere, he can sleep deeply. He has nothing to lose – no fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Once, at night, a king came across a very strange man, a very
luminous man, standing alert underneath a tree – so silent, so quiet and
so alert. The king was curious: “Why is he standing there?” From his
appearance he looked like a monk, one who has renounced the world. The
king was a very cultured man and he thought, “It is not right to disturb
him.” But every night it happened.</p><p><br></p><p>That was the routine of the king: to go around the capital at night
in disguise to see how things were going – whether the guards were on
duty or not; mixing and meeting with people, going into the hotels and
the theaters to find out how things were going – whether things were all
right or not.</p><p><br></p><p>Every night he would come across this man. He saw this man so many
times that it became impossible to resist the temptation. One day he
approached him and asked, “Excuse me, sir, I should not interfere – you
look so silent – but why do you go on standing the whole night? What are
you guarding? Is there any treasure underneath this tree?”</p><p><br></p><p>The mystic laughed. He said, “Not underneath this tree, but within me
there is a treasure and I am watching it. And the treasure is growing
every day, it is becoming bigger and bigger, hence I have to be more and
more alert.”</p><p><br></p><p>The mystic said to the king, “You can sleep, you have nothing to
lose. I cannot, I have much to lose; and if I can remain awake I have
much to gain.”</p><p><br></p><p>The king was very much impressed. He asked him to come to his palace,
he invited him. The monk agreed. The king was a little puzzled: a monk
agreeing so soon without even refusing once is not</p><p>thought to be right. A monk should say, “No, I cannot come to the
palace. I have renounced the world. It is all futile. It is all dream,
illusion, maya I cannot come back to the world. I am happy wherever I
am.”</p><p><br></p><p>But this monk didn’t say anything. He was a Zen Master. The king
started thinking in his mind, “Have I been deceived by this man? Was he
simply standing there every night just to catch hold of me?”</p><p><br></p><p>But now it was too late; he had invited him.</p><p><br></p><p>The mystic came to the palace, lived with the king. And, of course,
he lived more joyously than the king because he had no worries, no cares
about the empire, no problems and no anxieties. He enjoyed good food,
and the king had given him the best room in the palace – he lived just
like an emperor!</p><p><br></p><p>Six months passed. Now the king was boiling within himself to ask
him, “What kind of renunciation is this? You are enjoying everything –
servants and good food and good clothes and a beautiful palace.”</p><p><br></p><p>One day, walking in the garden, he asked the mystic, “Can I ask you a
question? Forgive me if you feel offended. This is my question: What is
the difference now between me and you?”</p><p><br></p><p>The mystic looked at the king and he said, “Why did you wait for six
months? This question you could have asked me the very first night. The
moment you invited me and I accepted your invitation, this question
arose in your mind. Why did you wait for six months? You tortured
yourself unnecessarily. I was expecting it at any moment. There is no
question of my feeling offended – it is a natural question.</p><p><br></p><p>“There is a difference, but it is very subtle. And if you really want
to know the difference, then come with me. I cannot tell you here. I
will tell you in a certain space, at a certain place. Come along with
me.”</p><p><br></p><p>They both went outside the city. The king said, “Now can you tell
me?” The mystic said, “Come along.”</p><p>When they were crossing the boundary of his empire – it was evening –
the king said,’What are you doing? Where are you taking me? Now this is
the end of my empire. We are entering somebody else’s kingdom and I
would like to be answered. What is your answer? And I am feeling very
tired.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the mystic said, “My answer is that I am going. Are you coming
with me or not? I am not going back.”</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, “How can I come with you? I have my whole empire, my
wife, my children. How can I come with you?”</p><p><br></p><p>The mystic said, “That’s the difference. But I am going!”</p><p>Again the king saw the light, the beauty of the man, and fell at his
feet. He said, “Come back! I am just stupid. I have missed these six
months. I have been thinking things which are really ugly. Forgive me
and come back.”</p><p><br></p><p>The mystic said, “There is no problem for me. I can come back, but
you will again think the same. It is better for me now to go ahead –
that story is finished, that chapter is closed – so that you can
remember the difference.”</p><p><br></p><p>The witness lives in the world just like a mirror, reflecting
everything. He may be in a hut, he may be in a palace; it makes no
difference. What difference does it make to a mirror whether the mirror
is in a hut or in a palace? What difference does it make to the mirror
whether the mirror is reflecting beautiful diamonds or just ordinary
stones? It makes no difference to the mirror.</p><p><br></p><p>Witnessing is the art of transcending the world. Witnessing is the
very essence of Zen, of religion itself. But don’t make it a thought –
it is not a thought at all. Thoughts have to be witnessed. Even if the
thought of witnessing arises, witness that thought. Remember that it is
not witnessing, it is only a thought – it has to be witnessed. It is
there in front of you. You are not it.</p><p><br></p><p>The witness is irreducible to any thought; it always goes on sliding
back. You cannot catch hold of it through any thought. It can witness
each and every thought, the thought of witnessing included; hence, it
can never itself become a thought.</p><p><br></p><p>Next time when you are meditating, Satyendra Saraswati, remember it.
Don’t start enjoying the thought that “This is a beautiful moment. My
mind is silent, my being is still. This is witnessing!” The moment you
say it, you have lost it.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question Question 2</p><p>OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>PLEASE SAY SOMETHING MORE ABOUT THE MAN OF ZEN.</p><p><br></p><p>Pratibha,</p><p><br></p><p>THE MAN OF ZEN IS VERY ORDINARY extraordinarily ordinary. He is so
ordinary that there is every possibility if you meet him you will not be
able to recognize him. He lives just like you, eats like you, sleeps
like you. He is in every way just like you. As far as his outside is
concerned he is not different from you at all.</p><p><br></p><p>The difference is certainly there, but that difference is inner. He
has an insight, he has a clarity. He has eyes and you are blind. He is
awake and you are asleep. You are drunk: drunk with greed, drunk with
lust, drunk with anger, ambition, ego.</p><p><br></p><p>The man of Zen is simply not drunk; he is in his senses. He walks
consciously, he sits consciously: “walking in Zen, sitting in Zen.” He
is not in any way special. He is not like other so-called saints.</p><p>He will not lie down on a bed of thorns or on a bed of nails, he will
not stand on his head. He is not stupid, he is not an exhibitionist. He
will not walk naked in the streets. He is not mad, he is not neurotic!
He lives in the very ordinary way, in the very normal way.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why it is the most difficult thing to recognize the man of
Zen. You can recognize a saint who walks on water – naturally, it is so
obvious that he is special. But a man of Zen does not walk on water. He
does not perform any miracles. He does not play any kind of egoistic
games. He is not an ego, he is not even a person. He is just a presence,
a nonentity. He is absolute nothingness. Only when one is absolute
nothingness is one full of awareness. Whatsoever he does, he does with
totality. Only a man who is not drunk can do things totally. Otherwise
one remains partial; only a part goes on doing something and at the same
time other parts may be going against it, being destructive. You may be
creating something with one hand and destroying it with the other.</p><p><br></p><p>A man who is drunk does not know where he is going. He thinks he is
on the right path, but that is only his dreaming.</p><p><br></p><p>Barry Higgins, a traveling salesman, was driving home to London one
afternoon after a hard-drinking lunch with a prospective customer.
Through the rearview mirror he spied the flashing blue light of a police
car behind. A shiver went up his spine and he grasped the steering wheel
tightly to steady his driving. The blue light approached, a siren
wailed, and a police car overtook him with a hand signalling him to pull
to a stop.</p><p><br></p><p>Barry was nervous as he saw the policeman get out of his car. His
breath was heavy and his hands were moist on the steering wheel. He
wondered what he was going to say.</p><p><br></p><p>The policeman came up and bent to speak through the car window. “Ay,
ay, now then, had a few, eh?”</p><p><br></p><p>Barry could not stop himself and blurted, “Ohh... g... good
onsternoon, afterble, I... I’m not as think as you drunk I am!”</p><p><br></p><p>The man of Zen is absolutely conscious – no greed, no anger, no
jealousy, no ambition. These are all intoxicants, these are all drugs:
they go on keeping you sleepy. It is a miracle how you manage your life
with so many poisons running in your bloodstream, in your very being.
That is the only difference; otherwise, from the outside, you will not
know.</p><p><br></p><p>There are other so-called saints who make outside differences because
there is no inner difference. They have to stand naked, they have to
torture their bodies, they have to go on fasting. They have to distort
their bodies, cripple their bodies. They have to do something that makes
them more special than you, “holier than thou.”</p><p><br></p><p>A Zen man is not “holier than thou.” He has no idea of being in any
way higher than you. He is simply living his nature.</p><p><br></p><p>Yoka says: The man of Zen goes alone.</p><p><br></p><p>That is his first characteristic. He is not part of a mob psychology.
He is not Hindu, he is not Mohammedan, he is not Christian, he is not
Jewish. He is not Indian, he is not Japanese, he is</p><p>not Chinese – he cannot be. He never belongs to any crowd. He is
alone. He is a rebel. He lives according to his light. He does not
follow, he does not imitate. He has reached the goal.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the goal? The goal is not somewhere outside you. It is not
there, far away like a star; it is within you, it is your own
interiority. He has entered his own interiority. And the man who has
reached his goal...</p><p><br></p><p>... CAN PLAY ON THE PATH OF NIRVANA.</p><p><br></p><p>He is playful, he is not serious. He cannot be serious: the whole of
life is a divine play, LEELA, and he is part of it. He is just playing a
role. He acts the role as beautifully as he can, as perfectly as he can,
but he knows that the whole world is a big stage, a great drama – but
nothing more. So he is not serious about it.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MAN OF ZEN HAS NATURAL MANNERS AND IS HARMONIOUS.</p><p><br></p><p>He does not pretend to be special, he has natural manners. He is very
human, utterly human. His humanity is superb, intense, absolute. He does
not claim any sacredness – and because he does not claim he is sacred.
He is harmonious. He is not divided within himself, he is not in a
constant fight with himself, he is not in a constant civil war. He has a
melody, a music. If you sit by his side you will be able to listen to
the music.</p><p><br></p><p>Navanit asked just the other day: “Osho, whenever I come close to you
I immediately smell a certain fragrance. What fragrance is it?” I don’t
use any perfume – I cannot. Navanit is a doctor, he knows; hence the
question has become more pertinent to him. And he says that he always
finds the same fragrance whenever he is close to me.</p><p><br></p><p>That fragrance has nothing to do with any perfume. It is the
fragrance of harmony, it is the music. It expresses itself in a
multi-dimensional way. Sometimes you will hear it as a silent sound like
a murmur, the wind passing through the pine trees, or the sound of
running water. Sometimes you will hear it as music and sometimes you
will experience it as a smell, a beautiful fragrance. Sometimes you will
see it as an aura, a light, very mysterious.</p><p><br></p><p>But the man of Zen simply lives in harmony, and out of harmony all
these things are manifested.</p><p><br></p><p>HIS SPIRIT IS SIMPLE, CLEAN, PURE AND SINCERE. HIS ZEN, WHICH NO ONE
SEES, IS TREASURE BEYOND ALL VALUE.</p><p><br></p><p>You can see his body, you cannot see his Zen. You cannot see his
inner meditativeness, you cannot see his awareness unless you become
aware yourself. You can know only that much which you have
experienced.</p><p><br></p><p>Navanit, you are blessed that you are experiencing a certain
fragrance. That means you are reaching to a certain depth, a certain
height in your being.</p><p><br></p><p>HIS ZEN, WHICH NO ONE SEES, IS TREASURE BEYOND ALL VALUE. THIS JEWEL,
RARE AND OF INCALCULABLE VALUE, NEVER CHANGES HOWEVER ONE USES IT. AND
OTHERS CAN FREELY BENEFIT FROM IT ON ALL OCCASIONS.</p><p>The man of Zen is always overflowing with joy. You can share it. He
is a giver: he gives delight, he gives joy, he gives beauty, he gives
truth. He radiates truth, he radiates God, but so silently... without
any declaration. He goes on pouring his blessings into existence. He is
a blessing to the world.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question Question 3 OSHO,</p><p>I KNOW MY LOVE STINKS, SO WHY DO I CLING TO THE SMELL?</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Amrito,</p><p><br></p><p>WE LIVE according to the past: our lives are rooted in the dead past,
we are conditioned by the past. The past is very powerful, that’s why
you go on living in a certain pattern; even if it stinks, you will go on
repeating it. You don’t know what else to do; you have become
conditioned to it. It is a mechanical phenomenon. And this is not only
so with you, Amrito, it is so with almost every human being – unless he
becomes a Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>To become a Buddha means to get rid of the past and to live in the
present. The past is immense, very huge, enormous, of millions of lives.
You have lived in a certain way. Now, being here, you may have become
aware that your love stinks, but that awareness is also not very deep,
it is very superficial. If it becomes really deep, if it penetrates to
the very core of your being, you will immediately jump out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is like if your house is on fire you will not ask anybody how to
get out of it. You will not consult the ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA, and
you will not wait for some wise man to come and tell you, and you will
not consider whether it is appropriate to jump out of the window or not
– you won’t bother about anything. Even if you are taking a bath naked
you will jump naked out of the window; you won’t even bother about
clothes. When the house is on fire, your life is at risk; now everything
else is secondary. If your love stinks – this has become your experience
– then you will come out of it. You will not simply ask a question, you
will jump out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>But I think that it is just an intellectual idea, because each time
you are in love, some misery arises. Each time there is some conflict,
some struggle, some fight, some jealousy, some possessiveness. So you
have started taking an intellectual standpoint: “My love stinks, so why
do I cling to the smell?” Because it is not yet really an existential
experience for you.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is your own smell. One becomes accustomed to one’s own smell.
That’s why when people are alone they don’t experience that smell, they
experience it only when they are together with somebody.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are in love, then you start showing your real face. Love is
a mirror. The other starts functioning a mirror. Every relationship
becomes a mirror. Alone, you don’t experience your own smell – you
cannot; one becomes immune to it. You have lived with it so long, how
can you smell it? It is only with the other that you start feeling that
he stinks and he starts feeling that you stink. And the fight
starts<span class=s4></span>That is the story of all the couples all
over the world.</p><p>“Where are you going with that goat, Juan?” asked the policeman. “I’m
taking him home to keep as a pet!” replied Juan.</p><p>“In the house?” “Sure thing.”</p><p>“But what about the smell?”</p><p><br></p><p>“So what? He ain’t gonna mind the smell!”</p><p><br></p><p>Your own smell is not disturbing to you. In fact, if it suddenly
disappears you will feel a little jolted, you will feel a little
uprooted, you will not feel your natural self; you will feel something
has gone wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>If you love and there is no jealousy you will start wondering whether
you love or not. What kind of love is this? There seems to be no
jealousy! You love a man, and if the man goes with another woman once in
a while, you don’t make much fuss about it. You take it for granted – it
is perfectly good for a change. And if your man is happy, why not let
him be happy? You love him. If you really love him you will respect his
happiness too. And he is not going forever.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, if once in a while couples are allowed a little freedom,
they will not separate; the divorce rate will drop in the world. Divorce
exists only because marriage is too tight. Let marriage be a little more
relaxed and divorce will disappear. Divorce is only a by-product of
marriage. The tighter the marriage system, the more divorce becomes an
absolute need. And if divorce is not allowed, then you have double
lives: one to show to the society and one to live.</p><p><br></p><p>It is because of marriage that prostitution exists in the world. The
whole blame goes to the marriage system. If people are a little more
loving and less jealous and if they understand human nature, it is
simple.</p><p><br></p><p>You eat the same food every day; you get fed up with it and once in a
while you would like to go to the hotel. And the hotel food may be worse
than what you get in your home, but even that is good – at least that
makes your home food look better. And when you come back the next day
you feel so relieved that you are back home, and you are so happy to
have the same food again!</p><p><br></p><p>The more man’s mind is understood, the more and more marriage will
have to be relaxed. It is perfectly okay to give a few days off in
marriage. The woman should be allowed to have her boyfriends and the man
should be allowed to have his girlfriends – at least, just as you have
Sunday religion, a Sunday marriage! And you will be surprised that your
own wife looks far better. Again a honeymoon starts – a mini-honeymoon.
You again start from ABC.</p><p><br></p><p>And being with many women and with many men does not destroy marriage
– no, not at all. It is a very nonsensical idea that has prevailed over
humanity: that it is destructive to marriage and family. It is not so –
it is very supportive. It will help the family to be more joyous, less
quarrelsome. Otherwise, the woman is constantly spying on the husband
and the husband is constantly spying</p><p>on the woman. And what love can exist between two persons who are
constantly at each other’s throats?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, your love stinks, as everybody else’s love stinks, but you feel
it only when you are in relationship. You have not yet felt that it
really has something to do with you. Deep down you still feel it must be
something wrong with the other. That’s how the mind functions: it throws
the responsibility on the other. It accepts itself and it is always
finding faults in others.</p><p><br></p><p>Several people are sitting in the front row of a movie theater. The
show has already begun when suddenly there is a terrible smell.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the spectators turns to the man sitting beside him and asks,
“Did you shit in your trousers?” The man beside him answers, “Yes,
why?”</p><p>People accept themselves totally! Whatsoever they are doing is right:
“Why? What is wrong in it? They are his own trousers, so who are you to
interfere? And freedom is everybody’s birthright!”</p><p><br></p><p>Amrito, if your love stinks, then try to find out what exactly it is
that stinks. It is not love, it is something else. Love itself has a
fragrance; it can’t stink, it is a lotus flower. Something else must be
in it – jealousy, possessiveness. But you have not mentioned jealousy
and possessiveness. You are hiding them. Love never stinks, it cannot;
that is not the nature of love. Please try to see exactly what it is
that creates the trouble. And I am not saying to repress it. All that is
needed is a clarity about it – what it is.</p><p><br></p><p>If it is jealousy, then I would only suggest one thing: be more
watchful of your jealousy. When it arises next time, rather than
becoming mad, close your doors, sit silently, sit in meditation, watch
your jealousy. See exactly what it is. It will surround you like smoke,
dirty smoke. It will suffocate you. You would like to go out and do
something. But don’t do anything; just be in a state of non- doing,
because anything done in a moment of jealousy is going to be
destructive. Just watch. And I am not saying repress it, because that is
again doing something.</p><p><br></p><p>People are either expressive or repressive, and both ways are wrong.
If you express you become destructive to the other person. Whosoever is
your victim suffers, and he is going to take revenge. He may not take
revenge consciously, but unconsciously it is going to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few months ago, Krishna Bharti fell in love with a woman.
Nothing extraordinary about it, but Deeksha got mad! Deeksha could not
accept the idea. For centuries we have been told that if a man loves you
or a woman loves you and the man or the woman goes to somebody else,
that is a rejection of you.</p><p><br></p><p>That is utter nonsense. It is not rejection; in fact, it is just the
opposite. If a man loves the woman and he enjoys the woman, he starts
fantasizing how it will be with other women. It is really the joy that
this woman has given him that triggers his fancy. It is not that he is
rejecting this woman; it is really an indication that this woman has
been such a nourishment that he would like to see and know how other
women are. And if a little rope is given he is not going to go very far,
he will come back, because with the other woman it may be novelty, it
will be something new, but it can’t be that</p><p>nourishing because there will not be any intimacy. It will have
something empty about it. It will be sex without love.</p><p><br></p><p>Love needs time to grow, it needs intimacy to grow. It needs a really
long time. It is not a seasonal flower that is there within three, four
weeks, but then within three, four weeks it is gone too. It is a long
long process of intimacy. Slowly slowly, two persons melt and merge into
each other; then it becomes nourishing. The other woman or the other man
cannot be nourishing. It may be just an adventure, a thrill. But then
suddenly the feeling will arise – it is bound to arise – that it is good
as fun, but it is not nourishing. And the person will be back.</p><p><br></p><p>And Krishna Bharti would have been back, but Deeksha went mad. She
behaved just like any other woman! But I was waiting... sooner or later
she was going to take revenge. Now she is taking revenge. Krishna Bharti
fell ill, he was in hospital, and Deeksha had a little freedom. She fell
in love with her own handyman! He really proved handy! Now K.B. is in
hell.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need to be so worried about it. I have given K.B. a
message: “Wait, don’t be worried. Just let her take revenge. And it is
good that unconscious burden is finished.”</p><p><br></p><p>If we understand each other a little more, if we understand human
nature a little more, there should be no jealousy. But it is a past
heritage of centuries.</p><p><br></p><p>So, Amrito, I cannot say you can drop it right now. You will have to
meditate over it. Whenever it possesses you, meditate over it. Slowly
slowly, the meditation will create the distance between you and the
jealousy. And the greater the distance, the less jealousy will arise.
And one day, when there is no jealousy, your love releases such a
fragrance that no flower can compete with it. All flowers are poor
compared to the flowering of love.</p><p><br></p><p>But your love is crippled because of jealousy and possessiveness and
anger.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not love that stinks, remember, because I have seen people who
think it is love that stinks so they close up, they become closed, they
stop loving.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what has happened to millions of monks and nuns down the ages:
they became closed to love, they dropped the whole idea of love. Rather
than dropping jealousy, which would have been a revolution, rather than
dropping possessiveness, which would have been something of immense
value, they dropped love. That is easy, that is not much; anybody can do
that. To be a monk or a nun is very easy, but to love and not to be
jealous, to love and not to be possessive, to love and let the other
have the whole freedom is really a great achievement. Only then will you
feel love and its fragrance.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question Question 4</p><p>OSHO, WHAT DO YOU THINK? IS JESUS COMING BACK TO EARTH AGAIN AS HE
HAD PROMISED OR NOT?</p><p><br></p><p>Sujata,</p><p>ONCE A MAN becomes awakened he cannot come back. He promises out of
his compassion, but it is not possible. It is not possible because it is
against the law of life. Jesus has promised to come back, Buddha also
has promised to come back, Krishna has also promised to come back.
Nobody has come yet and nobody is going to come back. It is against the
law of life. They promise because of their compassion, their love. They
promise because they see your misery, they see your sad state of
affairs, they see your tears. So they promise, and their promise fulfils
a certain purpose. Because of their promise you go on remembering them
and that remembrance helps you. Because of their promise you go on
connecting yourself to them, surrendering to them, and that surrendering
helps. But they cannot fulfil their promise.</p><p><br></p><p>Once a man is awakened there is no possibility of his being born
again. One can be born only if something in him has still remained
unconscious. Life is an opportunity to become conscious. It is a school,
a training school, where people become centered, rooted, integrated.
Once they have become integrated, once they have attained
self-realization, they cannot be allowed back into the school. They
disappear into the universal. They become part of God.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing to be remembered: Jesus, Krishna or Buddha cannot
come, but that does not mean that awakened people will not be there.
There will be people like Jesus, like Buddha, like Krishna – of the same
quality. Maybe their faces will not be the same and their bodies may not
be the same.…</p><p><br></p><p>And who would like to have a body like Jesus? You don’t know about
Jesus, that’s why. He was only four feet five inches, and a hunchback!
And it is said in the old scriptures that he was the ugliest man who has
walked on the earth. Who would like to have his body?</p><p><br></p><p>But his disciples have said he was the most beautiful man. They saw
his beauty; that is of the inner, hence there is no contradiction. The
disciples saw the inner. They saw the real Jesus, the pillar of his
consciousness. They saw his interiority. They communed with his being.
And, yes, there has never been such a beautiful man.</p><p><br></p><p>But the others saw only his body; the others could not see his soul,
the others could not see his Zen. Only his disciples could see his Zen,
his meditativeness, his love. Only his disciples could feel who he was,
his divineness. They could say, “He is the most beautiful man who has
ever walked on the earth.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the descriptions are so contradictory that it has been a problem
for the historians how to decide what is right. Both are right; there is
no need to decide. It is not a question of choosing this or that.</p><p><br></p><p>And, in the second place, even if it were possible for him to come
back, do you think he is mad? What did you do with him when he was here?
Just remember it: you tortured him as you have never tortured anybody
else before him.</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates’ death was not a torture. He was given poison and within
minutes he was dead. His death was a silent one.</p><p><br></p><p>The way Jesus was crucified is one of the most violent ways...
sometimes it takes three days for the person to die. Just nailing a man
on a cross cannot kill him immediately. Blood starts oozing from his
body slowly slowly. Life starts oozing out, but very slowly. Even the
weakest man will take</p><p>at least six to eighteen hours to die, and if the man is healthy he
can take even three days or more. This is real hell! This is real
torture!</p><p><br></p><p>He was dying on the cross, and people were throwing stones and abuse.
Soldiers were poking their spears into his body, and blood was coming
out of his body. He was alive, he was thirsty, and they would not give
him water. He was crying for water. And one hundred thousand people had
gathered to see this torture.</p><p><br></p><p>What did you do with Jesus when he was here? I think that was enough
to keep him away from this earth forever!</p><p><br></p><p>A new arrival knocked on heaven’s door. Jesus was on duty and opened
the door. “Who are you?” he asked.</p><p>“Adolf Hitler,” came the reply.</p><p><br></p><p>“Adolf Hitler! You cannot come here. You are a megalomaniac bent on
world domination. Get away!” “But I want to mend my ways!”</p><p>“No way! Get out!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, if you will let me in, I will give you something.” “Well,” said
Jesus, weakening a little, “what is it?”</p><p>Hitler, in dress uniform, pulled off his special Iron Cross and
showed it to Jesus. “Well,” he asked, “can I come in?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You just wait here. I’ll go and ask my dad.”</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus found God in his study. “Dad, there’s a newcomer at the gate
who wants to come in.” “Who is he?”</p><p>“Adolf Hitler.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Adolf Hitler! That megalomaniac bent on world domination? He can’t
come in here!” “But he has something very special to give me.”</p><p>“What is it?” “His Iron Cross.”</p><p>God thumped his chair. “What do you need an iron cross for? Hell, you
couldn’t even carry that wooden one!”</p><p>You forced poor Jesus to carry his own cross. He was weak; he had not
slept the whole night – the whole night he was tortured and questioned
and investigated. And then he had to carry that big wooden cross. He
fell thrice on the road under the burden of the cross. He was hurt and
wounded, but the soldiers whipped him again and forced him to carry his
cross.</p><p><br></p><p>He was only thirty-three years old. He had not seen much of life yet;
in fact, it was just the beginning. Had he lived as long as Buddha, the
world would have been enriched far more. Buddha lived eighty- four
years, Mahavira lived eighty years, Krishna almost the same age. They
died at a ripe old age. They saw the whole of life with all its ups and
downs, success and failure, misery and joy, ecstasy and agony. They
became mature and ripe. They could give to the world something immensely
valuable.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was allowed only three years. He started his ministry when he
was thirty years old and he was killed when he was thirty-three. Just
three years! He could not do much. He could have done great work for
humanity, but we killed him. And now we are waiting for his next
coming.</p><p><br></p><p>And if he comes you will do the same again, because you are doing the
same again to people of that quality, of that insight. You have always
been behaving as inhumanly as possible with the Buddhas.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus is a Buddha. That is exactly the meaning of the word “Christ.”
“Christ” and “Buddha” are synonymous. Buddha means the awakened one,
Christ means the crowned one. It is awakening that becomes your
crowning, that makes you an emperor, that takes all suffering away from
you and gives you the kingdom of God.</p><p><br></p><p>No, even if he could come he will not decide to come.</p><p><br></p><p>And man has not learned anything. After Jesus, you did the same with
Al-Hillaj Mansur. Even more ugly was the behavior with Al-Hillaj Mansur.
And the same is the attitude of the masses even today. Nothing has
changed. Man seems to be stagnant, stubborn, just living an unconscious
life and repeating it.</p><p><br></p><p>But, Sujata, why should you be waiting? You can find the awakened
ones any time; they are always available. Fortunately, there is always
somebody who is a Buddha. And those who are real seekers are bound to
find him because he is also seeking and searching for the real seekers.
It is not a one-way search.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have come here in search of me, I am also searching in my own
way for you. It is not one-way. If you are here, you are here only
because I have invited you to be here. You are here only because I have
called you forth to be here.</p><p><br></p><p>Now don’t waste your time thinking about whether Jesus will come or
not. What do you want with Jesus? I am ready to give you all that Jesus
can give to you. Be receptive, be surrendered, because he will ask for
the same conditions to be fulfilled. He cannot just deliver you as you
are; you will have to fulfil a few conditions. You will have to drop
your ego; that is the basic requirement. Fulfil that.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am your Jesus. Of course, the body is different, the mind is
different, but the consciousness is never different. Two awakened
persons are exactly the same. They belong to the same dimension, the
same fragrance, the same harmony, the same bliss, the same
godliness.</p><p>The fifth question Question 5 OSHO,</p><p>IS THERE A PLACE FOR COMPETITIVE SPORT IN THE NEW COMMUNE?</p><p><br></p><p>Anand Murti,</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE NEW COMMUNE there will be a new organization called “Athletics
Anonymous.” When you get the urge to play golf, baseball, or anything
else involving physical activity, someone will be sent over to drink
with you until the urge passes.</p><p><br></p><p>The sixth question Question 6</p><p>OSHO, I AM A JEW, ITALIAN, AND A PSYCHOLOGIST! IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR
ME?</p><p><br></p><p>Anand Shravan,</p><p><br></p><p>YOU ARE REALLY FORTUNATE! There is every hope for you; in fact, you
cannot miss. Even if you want to miss you cannot, because the Jew is
going to kill the poor Italian, and the psychologist is going to kill
the poor Jew, and when there is nothing left for the psychologist, they
almost always tend to commit suicide!</p><p><br></p><p>And the last question Question 7</p><p>OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>ARE YOU PUSHING MY PLEASURE BUTTON? WHEN I SIT IN LECTURE I AM ALL
SMILES AND IT TAKES ME HOURS TO WIPE IT OFF MY FACE.</p><p><br></p><p>Parmita,</p><p><br></p><p>YOU FOOL! Why do you try to wipe it off? I make so much effort to
create it and you take hours to wipe it off! Never do it again – so that
it becomes something permanent, something essential with you, something
natural, something that surrounds you.</p><p><br></p><p>But I know people are afraid of smiling, because if you are caught
red-handed by others smiling for no reason at all, they think you are
crazy. So people repress their smiles. That’s why Parmita must have been
trying to wipe it off.</p><p><br></p><p>But when I push the button I really push the button, and now I am
going to push harder! You will not be able to wipe it off even if you
make effort for hours or for days! Enjoy it! And what does it matter
if</p><p>people think you are crazy? Why be worried about it? There is nothing
wrong in being crazy. Here, at least, everything is crazy!</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day somebody asked, “Osho, there are so many clocks in
the ashram. Why do they all show different times?” Just crazy – cuckoo
clocks! And if they all show the same time, then what would be the need
for so many clocks? Then one would be enough!</p><p><br></p><p>Parmita, one joke for you:</p><p><br></p><p>A young nurse’s first duty on her new job was to bathe the man in
room 305. She performed her task and quickly returned to the nursing
station.</p><p><br></p><p>“How was he?” asked her supervisor, an old, seasoned nurse.</p><p><br></p><p>“He was doing fine,” she said, “but there was a very strange thing...
he had the word’little’ tattooed on his prick.”</p><p><br></p><p>The older nurse was very curious and decided to check it out. She
returned forty-five minutes later, hair messed up, clothes askew, and
said to the young nurse, “Honey, that tattoo does not say ‘little.’ It
says, ‘Little Rock, Arkansas, Pride of the South’!”</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

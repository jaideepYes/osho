because near me you can be lost forever. To come closer will mean death
and cannot mean anything else. I am just like an abyss. Come closer to
me and you will fall into me. For this, the invitation has been given to
you. You have heard it and you have come.</p><p><br></p><p>Be aware that through me you are not going to gain anything. Through
me you can only lose all – because unless you are lost, the divine
cannot happen; unless you disappear totally, the real cannot arise. You
are the barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>And you are so much, so stubbornly much, you are so filled with
yourself that nothing can penetrate you. Your doors are closed. When you
disappear, when you are not, the doors open. Then you become just like
the vast, infinite sky.</p><p>And that is your nature. That is Tao.</p><p><br></p><p>Before I enter into Chuang Tzu’s beautiful parable of The Empty Boat,
I would like to tell you one</p><p>other story, because that will set the trend for this meditation camp
which you are entering.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that it happened once, in some ancient time, in some
unknown country, that a prince suddenly went mad. The king was desperate
– the prince was the only son, the only heir to the kingdom. All the
magicians were called, miracle makers, medical men were summoned, every
effort was made, but in vain. Nobody could help the young prince, he
remained mad.</p><p><br></p><p>The day he went crazy he threw off his clothes, became naked, and
started to live under a big table. He thought that he had become a
rooster. Ultimately the king had to accept the fact that the prince
could not be reclaimed. He had gone insane permanently; all the experts
had failed.</p><p>But one day again hope dawned. A sage – a Sufi, a mystic – knocked on
the palace door, and said,</p><p>“Give me one opportunity to cure the prince.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the king felt suspicious, because this man looked crazy himself,
more crazy than the prince. But the mystic said, “Only I can cure him.
To cure a madman a greater madman is needed. And your somebodies, your
miracle makers, your medical experts, all have failed because they don’t
know the abc of madness. They have never traveled the path.”</p><p><br></p><p>It seemed logical, and the king thought, “There is no harm in it, why
not try?” So the opportunity was</p><p>given to him.</p><p>The moment the king said, “Okay, you try,” this mystic threw off his
clothes, jumped under the table</p><p>and crowed like a rooster.</p><p><br></p><p>The prince became suspicious, and he said, “Who are you? And what do
you think you are doing?”</p><p>The old man said, “I am a rooster, more experienced than you. You are
nothing, you are just a newcomer, at the most an apprentice.”</p><p><br></p><p>The prince said, “Then it is okay if you are also a rooster, but you
look like a human being.”</p><p><br></p><p>The old man said, “Don’t go on appearances, look at my spirit, at my
soul. I am a rooster like you.”</p><p>They became friends. They promised each other that they would always
live together and that this whole world was against them.</p><p><br></p><p>A few days passed. One day the old man suddenly started dressing. He
put on his shirt. The prince</p><p>said, “What are you doing, have you gone crazy, a rooster trying to
put on human dress?”</p><p><br></p><p>The old man said, “I am just trying to deceive these fools, these
human beings. And remember that even if I am dressed, nothing is
changed. My roosterness remains, nobody can change it. Just by dressing
like a human being do you think I am changed?” The prince had to
concede.</p><p>A few days afterwards the old man persuaded the prince to dress
because winter was approaching and it was becoming so cold.</p><p><br></p><p>Then one day suddenly he ordered food from the palace. The prince
became very alert and said, “Wretch, what are you doing? Are you going
to eat like those human beings, like them? We are roosters and we have
to eat like roosters.”</p><p>The old man said, “Nothing makes any difference as far as this
roos-ter is concerned. You can eat anything and you can enjoy
everything. You can live like a human being and remain true to your
roosterness.”</p><p><br></p><p>By and by the old man persuaded the prince to come back to the world
of humanity. He became absolutely normal.</p><p>The same is the case with you and me. And remember you are just
initiates, beginners. You may think that you are a rooster but you are
just learning the alphabet. I am an old hand, and only I can help you.
All the experts have failed, that’s why you are here. You have knocked
on many doors, for many lives you have been in search – nothing has been
of help to you.</p><p><br></p><p>But I say I can help you because I am not an expert, I am not an
outsider. I have traveled the same path, the same insanity, the same
madness. I have passed through the same – the same misery, the anguish,
the same nightmares. And whatsoever I do is nothing but to persuade – to
persuade you to come out of your madness.</p><p><br></p><p>To think oneself a rooster is crazy; to think oneself a body is also
crazy, even crazier. To think oneself a rooster is madness; to think
oneself a human being is a greater madness, because you don’t belong to
any form. Whether the form is that of a rooster or of a human being is
irrelevant – you belong to the formless, you belong to the total, the
whole. So whatsoever form you think you are, you are mad. You are
formless. You don’t belong to any body, you don’t belong to any caste,
religion, creed; you don’t belong to any name. And unless you become
formless, nameless, you will never be sane.</p><p>Sanity means coming to that which is natural, coming to that which is
ultimate in you, coming to that which is hidden behind you. Much effort
is needed because to cut form, to drop, eliminate form, is very
difficult. You have become so attached and identified with it.</p><p><br></p><p>This Samadhi Sadhana Shibir, this meditation camp, is nothing but to
persuade you towards the formless – how not to be in the form. Every
form means the ego: even a rooster has its ego, and man has his own.
Every form is centered in the ego. The formless means egolessness; then
you are not centered in the ego, then your center is everywhere or
nowhere. This is possible, this which looks almost impossible is
possible, because this has happened to me. And when I speak, I speak
through experience.</p><p>Wherever you are, I was, and wherever I am, you can be. Look at me as
deeply as possible and feel me as deeply as possible, because I am your
future, I am your possibility.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever I say surrender to me, I mean surrender to this possibility.
You can be cured, because your illness is just a thought. The prince
went mad because he became identified with the thought that he was a
rooster. Everybody is mad unless he comes to understand that he is not
identified with any form – only then, sanity.</p><p><br></p><p>So a sane person will not be anybody in particular. He cannot be.
Only an insane person can be somebody in particular – whether a rooster
or a man, a prime minister or a president, or anybody whatsoever. A sane
person comes to feel the nobodiness. This is the danger.…</p><p>You have come to me as somebody, and if you allow me, if you give me
the opportunity, this somebodiness can disappear and you can become a
nobody. This is the whole effort – to make you a nobody. But why? Why
this effort to become a nobody? Because unless you become nobody</p><p><br></p><p>you cannot be blissful; unless you become nobody you cannot be
ecstatic; unless you become nobody the benediction is not for you – you
go on missing life.</p><p>Really you are not alive, you simply drag, you simply carry yourself
like a burden. Much anguish happens, much despair, much sorrow, but not
a single ray of bliss – it cannot. If you are somebody, you are like a
solid block of stone, nothing can penetrate you. When you are nobody you
start to become porous. When you are nobody, really you are an
emptiness, transparent, everything can pass through you. There is no
hindrance, there is no barrier, no resistance. You become a passivity, a
door.</p><p>Right now you are like a wall; a wall means somebody. When you become
a door you become nobody. A door is just an emptiness, anybody can pass,
there is no resistance, no barrier. Somebody...you are mad; nobody...you
will become sane for the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>But the whole society, education, civilization, culture, all
cultivate you and help you to become somebodies. That is why I say:
religion is against civilization, religion is against education,
religion is against culture – because religion is for nature, for
Tao.</p><p><br></p><p>All civilizations are against nature, because they want to make you
somebody in particular. And the more you are crystallized as somebody,
the less and less the divine can penetrate into you.</p><p>You go to the temples, to the churches, to the priests, but there too
you are searching for a way to become somebody in the other world, for a
way to attain something, for a way to succeed. The achieving mind
follows you like a shadow. Wherever you go, you go with the idea of
profit, achievement, success, attainment. If somebody has come here with
this idea he should leave as soon as possible, run as fast as possible
from me, because I cannot help you to become somebody.</p><p>I am not your enemy. I can only help you to be nobody. I can only
push you into the abyss...bottomless. You will never reach anywhere; you
will simply dissolve. You will fall and fall and fall and dissolve, and
the moment you dissolve the whole existence feels ecstatic. The whole
existence celebrates this happening.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha attained this. Because of language I say attained; otherwise
the word is ugly, there is no attainment – but you will understand.
Buddha attained this emptiness, this nothingness. For two weeks, for
fourteen days continuously, he sat in silence, not moving, not saying,
not doing anything.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that the deities in heaven became disturbed – rarely it
happens that someone becomes such total emptiness. The whole of
existence felt a celebration, so deities came. They bowed down before
Buddha and they said, “You must say something, you must say what you
have attained. Buddha is reported to have laughed and said,”I have not
attained anything; rather, because of this mind, which always wants to
attain something, I was missing everything. I have not achieved
anything, this is not an achievement; rather, on the contrary, the
achiever has disappeared. I am no more, and, see the beauty of it – when
I was, I was miserable, and when I am no more, everything is blissful,
the bliss is showering and showering continuously on me, everywhere. Now
there is no misery.”</p><p>Buddha had said before: Life is misery, birth is misery, death is
misery – everything is miserable. It was miserable because the ego was
there. The boat had not been empty. Now the boat was empty;</p><p><br></p><p>now there was no misery, no sorrow, no sadness. Existence had become
a celebration and it would remain a celebration to eternity, for ever
and forever.</p><p>That’s why I say that it is dangerous that you have come to me.You
have taken a risky step. If you</p><p>are courageous, then be ready for the jump.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole effort is how to kill you, the whole effort is how to
destroy you. Once you are destroyed, the indestructible will come up –
it is there, hidden. Once all that which is nonessential is eliminated,
the essential will be like a flame – aliveness, total glory.</p><p>This parable of Chuang Tzu is beautiful. He says that a wise man is
like an empty boat. SUCH IS THE PERFECT MAN –</p><p>HIS BOAT IS EMPTY.</p><p><br></p><p>There is nobody inside.</p><p><br></p><p>If you meet a Chuang Tzu, or a Lao Tzu, or me, the boat is there, but
it is empty, nobody is in it. If you simply look at the surface, then
somebody is there, because the boat is there. But if you penetrate
deeper, if you really become intimate with me, if you forget the body,
the boat, then you come to encounter a nothingness.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu is a rare flowering, because to become nobody is the most
difficult, almost impossible, most extraordinary thing in the world.</p><p>The ordinary mind hankers to be extraordinary, that is part of
ordinariness; the ordinary mind desires to be somebody in particular,
that is part of ordinariness. You may become an Alexander, but you
remain ordinary – then who is the extraordinary one? The
extraordinariness starts only when you don’t hanker after
extraordinariness. Then the journey has started, then a new seed has
sprouted.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what Chuang Tzu means when he says: A perfect man is like an
empty boat. Many things are implied in it. First, an empty boat is not
going anywhere because there is nobody to direct it, nobody to
manipulate it, nobody to drive it somewhere. An empty boat is just
there, it is not going anywhere. Even if it is moving it is not going
anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>When the mind is not there life will remain a movement, but it will
not be directed. You will move, you will change, you will be a riverlike
flow, but not going anywhere, with no goal in view. A perfect man lives
without any purpose; a perfect man moves but without any motive. If you
ask a perfect man, “What are you doing?” he will say, “I don’t know, but
this is what is happening.” If you ask me why I am talking to you, I
will say, “Ask the flower why the flower is flowering.” This is
happening, this is not manipulated. There is no one to manipulate it,
the boat is empty. When there is purpose you will always be in misery.
Why?</p><p>Once a man asked a miser, a great miser, “How did you succeed in
accumulating so much wealth?” The miser said, “This is my motto:
whatsoever is to be done tomorrow should be done today, and</p><p>whatsoever is to be enjoyed today should be enjoyed tomorrow. This
has been my motto.” He</p><p><br></p><p>succeeded in accumulating wealth – and this is how people succeed in
accumulating nonsense also!</p><p>That miser was also miserable. On one hand he had succeeded in
accumulating wealth, on the other hand he had succeeded in accumulating
misery. And the motto is the same for accumulating money as it is for
accumulating misery: whatsoever is to be done tomorrow do it today,
right now, don’t postpone it. And whatsoever can be enjoyed right now,
never enjoy it right now, postpone it for tomorrow.</p><p>This is the way to enter hell. It always succeeds, it has never been
a failure. Try it and you will succeed – or, you may have already
succeeded. You may have been trying it without knowing. Postpone all
that which can be enjoyed, just think of the tomorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was crucified by the Jews for this reason, not for any other
reason. Not that they were against Jesus – Jesus was a perfect man, a
beautiful man, why should the Jews have been against him? Rather, on the
contrary, they had been waiting for this man. For centuries they had
been hoping and waiting: When will the messiah come?</p><p><br></p><p>And then suddenly this Jesus declared, “I am the messiah for whom you
have been waiting, and I have come now. Now look at me.”</p><p>They were disturbed – because the mind can wait, it always enjoys
waiting, but the mind cannot face the fact, the mind cannot encounter
this moment. It can always postpone, it was easy to postpone: The
messiah is to come, soon he will be coming.… For centuries the Jews had
been thinking and postponing and then suddenly this man destroyed all
hope, because he said, “I am here.” The mind was disturbed. They had to
kill this man, otherwise they would not have been able to live with the
hope of the tomorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>And not only Jesus, many others have declared since then, “I am here,
I am the messiah!” And Jews always deny, because if they don’t deny,
then how will they be able to hope and how will they be able to
postpone? They have lived with this hope with such fervor, with such
deep intensity, you can hardly believe it. There have been Jews who
would go to bed at night hoping that this would be the last night, that
in the morning the messiah would be there.…</p><p>I have heard about one rabbi who used to say to his wife, “If he
comes in the night, don’t waste a single minute, wake me up
immediately.” The messiah is coming and coming, he may come at any
moment.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard of another rabbi whose son was going to be married, so
he sent invitations to the marriage to friends and he wrote on the
invitation, “My son is going to be married in Jerusalem on such-and-such
a date, but if the messiah hasn’t come by then, my son will be married
in this village of Korz.” Who knows, by the time the day of the marriage
comes, the messiah may have come. Then I will not be here, I will be in
Jerusalem, celebrating. So if he has not come by the date of the
marriage, only then will it be held here in this village; otherwise, it
will be in Jerusalem.</p><p><br></p><p>They have been waiting and waiting, dreaming. The whole Jewish mind
has been obsessed with the coming messiah. But whenever the messiah
comes, they immediately deny him. This has to be</p><p><br></p><p>understood. This is how the mind functions: you wait for the bliss,
for the ecstasy, and whenever it comes you deny it, you just turn your
back towards it.</p><p>Mind can live in the future, but cannot live in the present. In the
present you can simply hope and desire. And that’s how you create
misery. If you start living this very moment, here and now, misery
disappears.</p><p>But how is it related to the ego? Ego is the past accumulated.
Whatsoever you have known, experienced, read, whatsoever has happened to
you in the past, the whole is accumulated there. That whole past is the
ego, it is you.</p><p><br></p><p>The past can project into the future – the future is nothing but the
past extended – but the past cannot face the present. The present is
totally different, it has a quality of being here and now. The past is
always dead, the present is life, the very source of all aliveness. The
past cannot face the present so it moves into the future – but both are
dead, both are nonexistential. The present is life; the future cannot
encounter the present, nor can the past encounter the present. And your
ego, your somebodiness, is your past. Unless you are empty you cannot be
here, and unless you are here you cannot be alive.</p><p><br></p><p>How can you know the bliss of life? Every moment it is showering on
you and you are bypassing it. Says Chuang Tzu:</p><p>SUCH IS THE PERFECT MAN –</p><p><br></p><p>HIS BOAT IS EMPTY.</p><p>Empty of what? Empty of the I, empty of the ego, empty of somebody
there inside. HE WHO RULES MEN, LIVES IN CONFUSION;</p><p>HE WHO IS RULED BY MEN LIVES IN SORROW.</p><p><br></p><p>HE WHO RULES MEN, LIVES IN CONFUSION. Why? The desire to rule comes
from the ego; the desire to possess, to be powerful, the desire to
dominate, comes from the ego. The greater the kingdom you can dominate,
the greater the ego you can achieve. With your possessions your inner
somebody goes on becoming bigger and bigger and bigger. Sometimes the
boat becomes very small because the ego becomes so big.…</p><p>This is what is happening to politicians, to people obsessed with
wealth, prestige, power. Their egos become so big that their boats
cannot contain them. Every moment they are on the point of drowning, on
the verge, afraid, scared to death. And the more afraid you are the more
possessive you become, because you think that through possessions
somehow security is achieved. The more afraid you are, the more you
think that if your kingdom could be a little greater, you would be more
secure.</p><p><br></p><p>HE WHO RULES MEN, LIVES IN CONFUSION.…</p><p><br></p><p>Really, the desire to rule comes out of your confusion; the desire to
be leaders of men comes out of your confusion. When you start leading
others you forget your confusion – this is a sort of escape, a trick.
You are ill, but if somebody is ill and you become interested in curing
that man, you forget your illness.</p><p>I have heard that once George Bernard Shaw phoned his doctor and
said, “I am in much trouble</p><p>and I feel that my heart is going to fail. Come immediately!”</p><p><br></p><p>The doctor came running. He had to run up three staircases and was
perspiring heavily. He came in and without saying anything, just fell
down on a chair and closed his eyes. Bernard Shaw jumped out of his bed
and asked, “What is happening?”</p><p>The doctor said, “Don’t say anything. It seems I am dying. It is a
heart attack.”</p><p><br></p><p>Bernard Shaw started helping him; he brought a cup of tea, some
aspirin, he did whatsoever he could. Within half an hour the doctor had
recovered. And then he said, “Now I must leave, give me my fee.”</p><p><br></p><p>George Bernard Shaw said, “This is really something. You should pay
me! I have been running around for half an hour doing things for you and
you haven’t even asked anything about me.”</p><p>But the doctor said, “I have cured you. This is a treatment and you
have to pay me the fee.”</p><p><br></p><p>When you become interested in somebody else’s illness you forget your
own, hence so many leaders, so many gurus, so many masters. It gives you
an occupation. If you are concerned with other people, if you are a
servant of people, a social worker, helping others, you will forget your
own confusion, your inner turmoil, because you are so occupied.</p><p>Psychiatrists never go mad – not because they are immune to it, but
they are so much concerned with other people’s madness, curing, helping,
that they forget completely that they also can go mad.</p><p><br></p><p>I have come to know many social workers, leaders, politicians, gurus,
and they stay healthy just because they are concerned with others.</p><p>But if you lead others, dominate others, out of your confusion you
will create confusion in their lives. It may be a treatment for
yourself, it may be a good escape for you, but it is spreading the
disease.</p><p><br></p><p>HE WHO RULES MEN, LIVES IN CONFUSION.…</p><p><br></p><p>And not only does he live in confusion, he also goes on spreading
confusion in others. Out of confusion only confusion is born.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you are confused, please remember – don’t help anybody, because
your help is going to be poisonous. If you are confused don’t be
occupied with others, because you are simply creating trouble, your
disease will become infectious. Don’t give advice to anyone, and if you
have a little clarity of thought, don’t take advice from someone who is
confused. Remain alert, because confused people always like to give
advice. And they give it free of charge, they give it very
generously!</p><p><br></p><p>Remain alert! Out of confusion only confusion is born.</p><p><br></p><p>...HE WHO IS RULED BY MEN LIVES IN SORROW.</p><p><br></p><p>If you dominate men, you live in confusion; if you allow others to
dominate you, you will live in sorrow, because a slave cannot be
blissful.</p><p>TAO THEREFORE DESIRED NEITHER TO INFLUENCE OTHERS NOR BE INFLUENCED
BY THEM.</p><p>You should not try to influence anybody, and you should be alert that
you are not influenced by others. The ego can do both but it cannot
remain in the middle. The ego can try to influence, then it feels good,
dominating, but remember that the ego also feels good being dominated.
The masters feel good because so many slaves are dominated, and the
slaves also feel good being dominated.</p><p>There are two types of mind in the world: the mind of those who
dominate – the male mind, and the mind of those who like to be dominated
– the female mind. By female I don’t mean women, or by male, men. There
are women who have masculine minds and there are men who have feminine
minds. They are not always the same.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the two types of mind: one which likes to dominate and one
which likes to be dominated. In both ways ego is fulfilled because
whether you dominate or are dominated YOU are important. If someone
dominates you, then too you are important, because his domination
depends on you. Without you, where will he be? Without you, where will
his kingdom be, his domination, his possession? Without you, he will be
nobody.</p><p><br></p><p>Ego is fulfilled at both the extremes, only in the middle does ego
die. Don’t be dominated and don’t</p><p>try to dominate.</p><p><br></p><p>Just think what will happen to you. You are not important in any way,
not significant in any way, neither as a master nor as a slave. Masters
cannot live without slaves and slaves cannot live without masters – they
need each other, they are complementary. Just like men and women, they
are complementary. The other is required for their fulfillment.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be either. Then who are you? Suddenly you disappear because
then you are not significant at all, nobody depends on you, you are not
needed.</p><p>There is a great need to be needed. Remember, you feel good whenever
you are needed. Sometimes, even if it brings misery to you, even then
you love to be needed.</p><p><br></p><p>A crippled child is confined to bed and its mother is constantly
worried about what to do: I have to serve this child and my whole life
is being wasted. But still, if this child dies, the mother will feel
lost, because at least this child needs her so totally that she has
become important.</p><p><br></p><p>If there is nobody who needs you, who are you? You create the need to
be needed. Even slaves are needed.</p><p>TAO THEREFORE DESIRED NEITHER TO INFLUENCE OTHERS NOR BE INFLUENCED
BY THEM.</p><p>THE WAY TO GET CLEAR OF CONFUSION AND FREE OF SORROW</p><p>IS TO LIVE WITH TAO</p><p>IN THE LAND OF THE VOID.</p><p><br></p><p>This middle point is the land of the void, or the door to the land of
the void – as if you are not, as if nobody needs you, and you don’t need
anybody. You exist as if you are not. If you are not significant the ego
cannot persist. That is why you go on trying to become significant in
some way or other. Whenever you feel that you are needed, you feel good.
But this is your misery and confusion, and this is the base of your
hell.</p><p><br></p><p>How can you be free? Look at these two extremes. Buddha called his
religion the middle path, MAJJHIM NIKAYA. He called it the middle path
because he said that mind lives in extremes. Once you remain in the
middle the mind disappears. In the middle there is no mind.</p><p>Have you seen a tightrope walker? Next time you see one, observe.
Whenever the tightrope walker leans towards the left, he immediately has
to move towards the right to balance; and whenever he feels he is
leaning too much to the right, he has to lean towards the left.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to go to the opposite to create balance. So it happens that
masters become slaves, slaves become masters; possessors become
possessed, the possessed becomes the possessor. It goes on, it is a
continuous balance.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you observed it in your relationships? If you are a husband, are
you really a husband for twenty-four hours? You have not observed. In
twenty-four hours the change happens at least twenty-four times –
sometimes the wife is the husband and the husband is the wife, sometimes
the husband is again the husband and the wife is again the wife.</p><p><br></p><p>And this goes on changing from left to right. It is a tightrope walk.
You have to balance. You cannot dominate for twenty-four hours, because
then the balance will be lost and the relationship will be
destroyed.</p><p>Whenever the tightrope walker comes to the middle, neither leaning to
the right nor leaning to the left, it is difficult for you to observe
unless you yourself are the tightrope walker. Tightrope walking has been
used in Tibet as a meditation, because in the middle the mind
disappears. The mind</p><p><br></p><p>comes into existence again when you lean towards the right, then the
mind comes again into being</p><p>and says: “Balance it, lean towards the left.”</p><p><br></p><p>When a problem arises, the mind arises. When there is no problem, how
can the mind arise? When you are just in the middle, balanced totally,
there is no mind. The equilibrium means no mind.</p><p>One mother, I have heard, was very worried about her son. He was ten
years old and he had not yet spoken a single word. Every effort was made
to find the cause but the doctors said, “Nothing is wrong, the brain is
absolutely okay. The body is fit, the child is healthy, and nothing can
be done. If something had been wrong, then something could have been
done.”</p><p><br></p><p>But still he would not speak. Then suddenly, one day in the morning,
the son spoke and he said,</p><p>“This toast is too burned.”</p><p><br></p><p>The mother couldn’t believe it. She looked, she got scared and said,
“What! You have spoken? And</p><p>spoken so well! Then why were you always silent? We persuaded and
tried and you never spoke.” The child said, “There was never anything
wrong. For the first time the toast is burned.”</p><p>If there is nothing wrong why should you speak?</p><p><br></p><p>People come to me and they say, “You go on speaking every day<span class=s5></span>” I say, “Yes, because so many</p><p>wrong people go on coming here and listening. There is so much wrong
that I have to speak. If nothing is wrong then there is no need to
speak. I speak because of you, because the toast is burned.”</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever it is in the middle, between any extreme or polarity, the
mind disappears. Try it. Rope walking is a beautiful exercise, and one
of the very subtle methods of meditation. Nothing else is needed. You
can observe the rope walker yourself, how it happens.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, on a rope thinking stops because you are in such
danger. You cannot think. The moment you think, you will fall. A rope
walker cannot think, he has to be alert every moment. The balance has to
be maintained continuously. He cannot feel safe, he is not safe: he
cannot feel secure, he is not secure. The danger is always there – any
moment, a slight change of balance and he will fall And death
awaits.</p><p>If you walk on a tightrope you will come to feel two things: thinking
stops because there is danger, and whenever you really come to the
middle, neither left nor right, just the mid-point, a great silence
descends on you such as you have not known before. And this happens in
every way. The whole of life is a tightrope walk.</p><p>Tao therefore desired to remain in the middle – neither be dominated
nor be dominating, neither be a husband nor be a wife, neither be a
master nor be a slave.</p><p>THE WAY TO GET CLEAR OF CONFUSION AND FREE OF SORROW</p><p><br></p><p>IS TO LIVE WITH TAO</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE LAND OF THE VOID.</p><p><br></p><p>In the middle the door opens – the land of the void. When you are
not, the whole world disappears, because the world hangs on you. The
whole world that you have created around you hangs on you. If you are
not there the whole world disappears.</p><p>Not that existence goes into nonexistence, no. But the world
disappears and existence appears. The world is a mind-creation;
existence is the truth. This house will be there, but then this house
will not be yours. The flower will be there but the flower will become
nameless. It will be neither beautiful nor ugly. It will be there, but
no concept will arise in your mind. All conceptual framework disappears.
Existence, bare, naked, innocent, remains there in its pure, mirrorlike
beingness. And all the concepts, all the imaginations, all the dreams,
disappear in the land of the void.</p><p><br></p><p>IF A MAN IS CROSSING A RIVER</p><p><br></p><p>AND AN EMPTY BOAT COLLIDES WITH HIS OWN SKIFF, EVEN THOUGH HE BE A
BAD-TEMPERED MAN</p><p>HE WILL NOT BECOME VERY ANGRY. BUT IF HE SEES A MAN IN THE BOAT,</p><p>HE WILL SHOUT TO HIM TO STEER CLEAR.</p><p><br></p><p>AND IF THE SHOUT IS NOT HEARD HE WILL SHOUT AGAIN, AND YET AGAIN, AND
BEGIN CURSING –</p><p>AND ALL BECAUSE THERE IS SOMEBODY IN THAT BOAT. YET IF THE BOAT WERE
EMPTY,</p><p>HE WOULD NOT BE SHOUTING, AND HE WOULD NOT BE ANGRY.</p><p><br></p><p>If people go on colliding with you and if people go on being angry
with you, remember, they are not at fault. Your boat is not empty. They
are angry because you are there. If the boat is empty they will look
foolish, if they are angry they will look foolish.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who are very intimate with me sometimes get angry with me and
they look very foolish! If the boat is empty you can even enjoy the
anger of others, because there is nobody to be angry with, they have not
looked at you. So remember, if people go on colliding with you, you are
too much of a solid wall. Be a door, become empty, let them pass.</p><p>Even then sometimes people will be angry – they are even angry with a
buddha. Because there are foolish people who, if their boat collides
with an empty boat, they will not look to see whether</p><p><br></p><p>someone is in it or not. They will start shouting; they will get so
messed up within themselves that they will not be able to see whether
someone is in it or not.</p><p>But even then the empty boat can enjoy it because then the anger
never hits you; you are not there, so whom can it hit?</p><p>This symbol of the empty boat is really beautiful. People are angry
because you are too much there, because you are too heavy there – so
solid they cannot pass. And life is intertwined with everybody. If you
are too much, then everywhere there will be collision, anger,
depression, aggression, violence – the conflict continues.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you feel that someone is angry or someone has collided with
you, you always think that he is responsible. This is how ignorance
concludes, interprets. Ignorance always says, “The other is
responsible.” Wisdom always says, “If somebody is responsible, then I am
responsible, and the only way not to collide is not to be.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am responsible” doesn’t mean, “I am doing something, that is why
they are angry.” That is not the question. You may not be doing
anything, but just your being there is enough for people to get angry.
The question is not whether you are doing good or bad. The question is
that you are there.</p><p>This is the difference between Tao and other religions. Other
religions say: Be good, behave in such a</p><p>way that no one gets angry with you. Tao says: Don’t be.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a question of whether you behave or misbehave. This is not
the question. Even a good man, even a very saintly man, creates anger,
because he is there. Sometimes a good man creates more anger than a bad
man, because a good man means a very subtle egoist. A bad man feels
guilty – his boat may be filled, but he feels guilty. He is not really
so spread out on the boat, his guilt helps him to shrink. A good man
feels himself to be so good that he fills the boat completely, overfills
it.</p><p>So whenever you come near a good man, you will always feel tortured –
not that he is torturing you, it is just his presence. With so-called
good men you will always feel sad, and you would like to avoid them.
So-called good men are really very heavy. Whenever you come into contact
with them they make you sad, they depress you, and you would like to
leave them as soon as possible.</p><p>The moralists, the puritans, the virtuous, they are all heavy, and
they carry a burden around with them, and dark shadows. Nobody likes
them. They cannot be good companions, they cannot be good friends.
Friendship is impossible with a good man – almost impossible, because
his eyes are always condemning. The moment you come near him, he is good
and you are bad. Not that he is doing anything in particular – just his
very being creates something, and you will feel angry.</p><p><br></p><p>Tao is totally different. Tao has a different quality, and to me Tao
is the deepest religion that has existed on this earth. There is no
comparison to it. There have been glimpses, there are glimpses in the
sayings of Jesus, in Buddha, in Krishna – but only glimpses.</p><p>Lao Tzu or Chuang Tzu’s message is the purest – it is absolutely
pure, nothing has contaminated it. And this is the message: it is all
because there is somebody in the boat. This whole hell is all because
there is somebody in the boat.</p><p><br></p><p>YET IF THE BOAT WERE EMPTY,</p><p>HE WOULD NOT BE SHOUTING, AND HE WOULD NOT BE ANGRY. IF YOU CAN EMPTY
YOUR OWN BOAT</p><p>CROSSING THE RIVER OF THE WORLD, NO ONE WILL OPPOSE YOU,</p><p>NO ONE WILL SEEK TO HARM YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>THE STRAIGHT TREE IS THE FIRST TO BE CUT DOWN,</p><p><br></p><p>THE SPRING OF CLEAR WATER IS THE FIRST TO BE DRAINED DRY. IF YOU WISH
TO IMPROVE YOUR WISDOM</p><p>AND SHAME THE IGNORANT,</p><p>TO CULTIVATE YOUR CHARACTER AND OUTSHINE OTHERS, A LIGHT WILL SHINE
AROUND YOU</p><p>AS IF YOU HAD SWALLOWED THE SUN AND THE MOON –</p><p><br></p><p>AND YOU WILL NOT AVOID CALAMITY.</p><p><br></p><p>This is unique. Chuang Tzu is saying that the halo of saintliness
around you shows that you are still there. The halo that you are good is
sure to create calamity for you, and calamity for others also. Lao Tzu
and Chuang Tzu – master and disciple – have never been painted in
pictures with halos, auras, around them. Unlike Jesus, Zarathustra,
Krishna, Buddha, Mahavira, they have never been painted with an aura
around their head, “because,” they say, “if you are really good no aura
appears around your head; rather on the contrary, the head disappears.”
Where to draw the aura? The head disappears.</p><p>All auras are somehow related to the ego. It is not Krishna who has
made a self-portrait, it is the disciples. They cannot think of him
without drawing an aura around his head – then he looks extraordinary.
And Chuang Tzu says: To be ordinary is to be the sage. Nobody recognizes
you, nobody feels that you are somebody extraordinary. Chuang Tzu says:
You go in the crowd and you mix, but no one knows that a buddha has
entered the crowd. No one comes to feel that somebody is different,
because if someone feels it then there is bound to be anger and
calamity. Whenever someone feels that you are somebody, his own anger,
his own ego is hurt. He starts reacting, he starts attacking you.</p><p><br></p><p>So Chuang Tzu says: Character is not to be cultivated because that
too is a sort of wealth. And so- called religious people go on teaching:
Cultivate character, cultivate morality, be virtuous.</p><p><br></p><p>But why? Why be virtuous? Why be against the sinners? But your mind
is a doer, you are still ambitious. And if you reach paradise and there
you see sinners sitting around God, you will feel very hurt – your whole
life has been wasted. You cultivated virtue, you cultivated character,
while these people were enjoying themselves and doing all sorts of
things which are condemned, and here they are sitting around God. If you
see saints and sinners together in paradise you will be very hurt, you
will become very sad and miserable – because your virtue is also part of
your ego. You cultivate saintliness to be superior, but the mind stays
the same. How to be superior in some way or other, how to make others
inferior, is the motive.</p><p>If you can gather much wealth, then they are poor and you are rich.
If you can become an Alexander, then you have a great kingdom and they
are beggars. If you can become a great scholar, then you are
knowledgeable and they are ignorant, illiterate. If you can become
virtuous, religious, respectable, moral, then they are condemned, they
are sinners. But the duality continues. You are fighting against others
and you are trying to be superior.</p><p>Chuang Tzu says: If you cultivate your character and outshine others,
you will not avoid calamity.</p><p>Don’t try to outshine others, and don’t try to cultivate character
for this egoistic purpose.</p><p><br></p><p>So for Chuang Tzu there is only one character worth mentioning, and
that is egolessness. All else follows it. Without it, nothing has worth.
You may become godlike in your character, but if the ego is there
inside, all your godliness is in the service of the devil; all your
virtue is nothing but a face and the sinner is hidden behind. And the
sinner cannot be transformed through virtue or through any type of
cultivation. It is only when you are not there that it disappears.</p><p>A WISE MAN HAS SAID:</p><p><br></p><p>“HE WHO IS CONTENT WITH HIMSELF</p><p><br></p><p>HAS DONE WORTHLESS WORK.</p><p><br></p><p>ACHIEVEMENT IS THE BEGINNING OF FAILURE,</p><p>FAME IS THE BEGINNING OF DISGRACE.”</p><p><br></p><p>These are very paradoxical sayings, and you will have to be very
alert to understand them; otherwise they can be misunderstood.</p><p><br></p><p>A WISE MAN HAS SAID:</p><p><br></p><p>“HE WHO IS CONTENT WITH HIMSELF HAS DONE WORTHLESS WORK.”</p><p>Religious people go on teaching: Be content with yourself. But
yourself remains there to be content with. Chuang Tzu says: Don’t be
there, then there is no question of contentment or discontentment. This
is real contentment, when you are not there. But if you feel that you
are content, it is false – because you are there, and it is just an ego
fulfillment. You feel that you have achieved, you feel that you have
reached.</p><p><br></p><p>Tao says that one who feels that he has achieved has missed already.
One who feels that he has reached has lost, because success is the
beginning of failure. Success and failure are two parts of one circle,
of one wheel. Whenever success reaches its climax the failure has
already started, the wheel is already turning downwards. Whenever the
moon has become full there is no further progress. Now there is no
further movement. Then next day the downward journey starts and now
every day the moon will be less and less and less.</p><p>Life moves in circles. The moment you feel that you have achieved,
the wheel has moved, you are already losing. It may take time for you to
recognize this, because mind is dull. Much intelligence is needed,
clarity is needed, to see things when they happen. Things happen to you
and you take many days to recognize it, sometimes many months or years.
Sometimes you even take many lives to recognize what has happened.</p><p><br></p><p>But just think about your past. Whenever you had a feeling that you
had succeeded, immediately things changed, you started falling – because
the ego is part of the wheel. It succeeds because it can fail: if it
cannot fail then there is no possibility of success. Success and failure
are two aspects of the same coin.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu says:</p><p>A WISE MAN HAS SAID:</p><p><br></p><p>“HE WHO IS CONTENT WITH HIMSELF HAS DONE WORTHLESS WORK.”</p><p>...Because he is still there, the empty boat has not come into being
yet, the boat is still filled. The ego is sitting there, the ego is
still enthroned.</p><p>“ACHIEVEMENT IS THE BEGINNING OF FAILURE, FAME IS THE BEGINNING OF
DISGRACE.”</p><p>He has nothing to lose. Hence, Buddha’s beggars – nameless, homeless,
nothing to protect, nothing to preserve. They could move anywhere, just
like clouds in the sky, homeless, with no roots anywhere, floating, with
no goal, no purpose, no ego.</p><p>HE WILL FLOW LIKE TAO, UNSEEN, HE WILL GO ABOUT LIKE LIFE ITSELF WITH
NO NAME AND NO HOME.</p><p>This is what a sannyasin means to me. When I initiate you into
sannyas, I initiate you into this death of namelessness, of
homelessness. I am not giving you any secret key of success, I am not
giving you any secret formula of how to succeed.</p><p><br></p><p>If I am giving you anything, it is a key of how not to succeed, of
how to be a failure and unworried, how to move nameless, homeless,
without any goal, how to be a beggar – what Jesus calls poor in spirit.
A man who is poor in spirit is egoless – he is the empty boat.</p><p>SIMPLE IS HE, WITHOUT DISTINCTION.</p><p><br></p><p>Whom do you call simple? Can you cultivate simplicity?</p><p><br></p><p>You see a man who eats only once a day, who wears only a few clothes
or remains naked, who doesn’t live in a palace, who lives under a tree –
and you say this man is simple. Is this simplicity? You can live under a
tree and your living may be just a cultivation. You have cultivated it
to be simple, you have calculated it to be simple. You may eat once a
day, but you have calculated it, this is mind- manipulated. You may
remain naked, but that cannot make you simple. Simplicity can only
happen.</p><p>SIMPLE IS HE, WITHOUT DISTINCTION.</p><p><br></p><p>But you feel that you are a saint because you live under a tree, and
you eat once a day, and you are a</p><p>vegetarian, and you live naked, you don’t possess any money – you are
a saint.</p><p><br></p><p>And then when a man passes who possesses money, condemnation arises
in you, and you think, “What will happen to this sinner? He will be
condemned to hell. And you feel compassion for this sinner. Then you are
not simple. Because distinctions have entered, you are distinct.</p><p><br></p><p>It makes no difference how the distinction has been created. A king
lives in a palace – he is distinct from those who live in huts. A king
wears clothes which you cannot wear – they are so valuable that he is
distinct. A man lives naked on the street and you cannot live naked in
the street – so he is distinct. Wherever distinction is, ego exists.
When there is no distinction, ego disappears; and non- ego is
simplicity.</p><p>SIMPLE IS HE, WITHOUT DISTINCTION. TO ALL APPEARANCES HE IS A
FOOL.</p><p>This is the deepest saying that Chuang Tzu has uttered. It is
difficult to understand because we always think that an enlightened
person, a perfect man, is a man of wisdom. And he says: TO ALL
APPEARANCES HE IS A FOOL.…</p><p>But this is how it should be. Amongst so many fools, how can a wise
man be otherwise? To all appearances he will be a fool and that is the
only way. How can he change this foolish world and so many fools, to
sanity? He will have to be naked, and go under the table and crow like a
rooster. Only then can he change you. He must become crazy like you, he
must be a fool, he must allow you to laugh at him. Then you will not
feel jealous, then you will not feel hurt, then you will not be angry
with him, then you can tolerate him, then you can forget him and forgive
him, then you can leave him alone to himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Many great mystics have behaved like fools and their contemporaries
were at a loss about what to make out of their lives – and the greatest
wisdom existed in them. To be wise amongst you is really</p><p><br></p><p>foolish. It won’t do; you will create much trouble. Socrates was
poisoned because he didn’t know Chuang Tzu. Had he known Chuang Tzu,
there would have been no need for him to be poisoned. He tried to behave
like a wise man; amongst fools he tried to be wise.</p><p>Chuang Tzu says: To all appearances the wise man will be like a
fool.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu himself lived like a fool, laughing, singing and dancing,
talking in jokes and anecdotes. Nobody thought him to be serious. And
you could not find a more sincere or serious man than Chuang Tzu. But
nobody thought him to be serious. People enjoyed him, people loved him,
and through this love he was sowing seeds of his wisdom. He changed
many, he transformed many.</p><p><br></p><p>But to change a madman you have to learn his language, you have to
use his language. You have to be like him, you have to come down. If you
go on standing on your pedestal then there can be no communion.</p><p>This is what happened to Socrates, and it had to happen there because
the Greek mind is the most rational mind in the world, and a rational
mind always tries not to be foolish. Socrates angered everybody. People
had to kill him really, because he would ask awkward questions and he
would make everybody feel foolish. He put everybody in a corner –
because one cannot answer even ordinary questions if somebody
insists.</p><p><br></p><p>If you believe in God, Socrates will ask something about God; you
cannot answer, you have not yet seen. What is the proof? God is a far
off thing. You cannot prove even ordinary things. You have left your
wife at home – how can you prove, really, that you have left your wife
at home, or that you have even got a wife? It may be just in your
memory. You may have seen a dream, and when you go back there is neither
house nor wife.</p><p>Socrates asked questions, penetrating, analyzing everything, and
everyone in Athens became angry. This man was trying to prove that they
were all fools. They killed him. Had he met Chuang Tzu – and at that
time Chuang Tzu was alive in China, they were contemporaries – then
Chuang Tzu would have told him the secret: Don’t try to prove that
anybody is foolish because fools don’t like it. Don’t try to prove to a
madman that he is mad, because no madman likes it. He will get angry,
arrogant, aggressive. He will kill you if you prove too much. If you
come to the point where it can be proved, he will take revenge.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu would have said: It is better to be foolish yourself, then
people enjoy you, and then by a very subtle methodology you can help
them change. Then they are not against you.</p><p>That is why in the East, particularly in India, in China and in
Japan, such an ugly phenomenon never happened as happened in Greece
where Socrates was poisoned and killed. It happened in Jerusalem – Jesus
was killed, crucified. It happened in Iran, in Egypt, in other countries
– many wise men were killed, murdered. It never happened in India, in
China, in Japan, because in these three countries people came to realize
that to behave as a wise man is to invite calamity.</p><p>Behave like a fool, like a madman, just be mad. That is the first
step of the wise man – to make you at ease so you are not afraid of
him.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why I told you that story. The prince became friendly with
the man. He was afraid of other doctors, learned experts, because they
were trying to change him, cure him, and he was not mad. He did not
think that he was mad, no madman ever thinks that he is mad. If a madman
ever comes to realize that he is mad, madness has disappeared. He is mad
no more.</p><p>So all those wise men who were trying to cure the prince were
foolish, and only this old sage was wise. He behaved foolishly. The
court laughed, the king laughed, the queen laughed and said, “What? How
is this man going to change the prince? He himself is crazy and seems to
be deeper in madness than the prince.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the prince was shocked. He said, “What are you doing? What do
you mean?” But this man</p><p>must have been an enlightened sage.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu is talking about this type of phenomenon, this phenomenal
man. TO ALL APPEARENCES HE IS A FOOL.</p><p><br></p><p>HIS STEPS LEAVE NO TRACE.</p><p>You cannot follow him. You cannot follow an enlightened man – no,
never – because he leaves no trace, there are no footprints. He is like
a bird in the sky: he moves and no trace is left.</p><p><br></p><p>Why does a wise man not leave traces? So that you should not be able
to follow. No wise man likes you to follow him because when you follow
you become imitators. He is always moving in such a zig- zag way that
you cannot follow. If you try to follow him, you will miss. Can you
follow me? It is impossible, because you don’t know what I am going to
be tomorrow. You cannot predict. If you can predict, you can plan. Then
you know where I am going, then you know the direction, then you know my
steps. You know my past, you can infer my future. But I am
illogical.</p><p><br></p><p>If I am logical you can conclude what I am going to say tomorrow.
Just by looking at what I have said in my yesterdays you can conclude
logically what I am going to say tomorrow. But that is not possible. I
may contradict myself completely. My every tomorrow will contradict my
every yesterday, so how are you going to follow me? You will go crazy if
you try to follow.</p><p><br></p><p>Sooner or later you will have to realize that you have to be
yourself, you cannot imitate. HIS STEPS LEAVE NO TRACE.</p><p><br></p><p>He is not consistent. He is not logical. He is illogical. He is like
a madman. HE HAS NO POWER.</p><p>This will be very difficult to follow because we think that the sage
has power, that he is the most powerful of men. He will touch your blind
eyes and they will open and you will be able to see; you are dead and he
will touch you and you will be resurrected. To us a sage is a
miracle-worker.</p><p><br></p><p>But Chuang Tzu says: He has no power, because to use power is always
part of the ego. The ego wants to be powerful. You cannot persuade a
wise man to use his power, it is impossible. If you can,</p><p><br></p><p>it means some ego was left to be persuaded. He will never use his
power because there is no one to use and manipulate it. The ego, the
manipulator, is there no more, the boat is empty. Who will direct this
boat? There is nobody.</p><p>A sage is power, but he has no power; a sage is powerful, but he has
no power – because the controller is there no more. He is energy –
overflowing, unaddressed, undirected – but there is no one who can
direct it. You may be cured in his presence, your eyes may open, but he
has not opened them, he has not touched them, he has not cured you. If
he thinks that he has cured you, he himself has become ill. This ‘I’
feeling – I have cured – is a greater illness, it is a greater
blindness.</p><p>HE HAS NO POWER.</p><p><br></p><p>HE ACHIEVES NOTHING, HE HAS NO REPUTATION. AND SINCE HE JUDGES NO
ONE,</p><p><br></p><p>NO ONE JUDGES HIM.</p><p><br></p><p>SUCH IS THE PERFECT MAN –</p><p><br></p><p>HIS BOAT IS EMPTY.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is going to be your path. Empty your boat. Go on throwing
out whatever you find in the boat until everything is thrown out and
nothing is left, even YOU are thrown out, nothing is left, your being
has become just empty.</p><p>The last thing and the first thing is to be empty: once you are empty
you will be filled. The all will descend on you when you are empty –
only emptiness can receive the all, nothing less will do, because to
receive all you have to be empty, boundlessly empty. Only then can the
all be received. Your minds are so small they cannot receive the divine.
Your rooms are so small you cannot invite the divine. Destroy this house
completely because only the sky, space, total space, can receive.</p><p><br></p><p>Emptiness is going to be the path, the goal, everything. From
tomorrow morning try to empty yourself of all that you find within: your
misery, your anger, your ego, jealousies, sufferings, your pain, your
pleasures – whatever you find, just throw it out. Without any
distinction, without any choice, empty yourself. And the moment you are
totally empty, suddenly you will see that you are the whole, the all.
Through voidness, the whole is achieved.</p><p>Meditation is nothing but emptying, becoming nobody.</p><p><br></p><p>In this camp move as a nobody. And if you create anger in somebody
and you collide, remember, you must be there in the boat, that’s why it
is happening. Soon, when your boat is empty, you will not collide, there
will be no conflict, no anger, no violence – nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>And this nothing is the benediction, this nothing is the blessing.
For this nothing you have been searching and searching.</p><p>Enough for today.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s3>2</span></p><p><br></p><p>The Man of Tao</p><p><br></p><p>11 July 1974 am in Buddha Hall</p><p><br></p><p>THE MAN OF TAO ACTS WITHOUT IMPEDIMENT, HARMS NO OTHER BEING BY HIS
ACTIONS,</p><p>YET HE DOES NOT KNOW HIMSELF TO BE KIND AND GENTLE. HE DOES NOT
STRUGGLE TO MAKE MONEY,</p><p>AND HE DOES NOT MAKE A VIRTUE OF POVERTY. HE GOES HIS WAY WITHOUT
RELYING ON OTHERS,</p><p>AND DOES NOT PRIDE HIMSELF ON WALKING ALONE. THE MAN OF TAO REMAINS
UNKNOWN.</p><p>PERFECT VIRTUE PRODUCES NOTHING. NO SELF IS TRUE SELF.</p><p>AND THE GREATEST MAN IS NOBODY.</p><p><br></p><p>The most difficult thing, the almost impossible thing for the mind,
is to remain in the middle, is to remain balanced. And to move from one
thing to its opposite is the easiest. To move from one</p><p><br></p><p>polarity to the opposite polarity is the nature of the mind. This has
to be understood very deeply, because unless you understand this,
nothing can lead you to meditation.</p><p>Mind’s nature is to move from one extreme to another. It depends on
imbalance. If you are balanced, mind disappears. Mind is like a disease:
when you are imbalanced it is there, when you are balanced, it is not
there.</p><p><br></p><p>That is why it is easy for a person who overeats to go on a fast. It
looks illogical, because we think that a person who is obsessed with
food cannot go on a fast. But you are wrong. Only a person who is
obsessed with food can fast, because fasting is the same obsession in
the opposite direction. It is not really changing yourself. You are
still obsessed with food. Before you were overeating; now you are hungry
– but the mind remains focused on food from the opposite extreme.</p><p>A man who has been overindulging in sex can become a celibate very
easily. There is no problem. But it is difficult for the mind to come to
the right diet, difficult for the mind to stay in the middle.</p><p>Why is it difficult to stay in the middle? It is just like the
pendulum of a clock. The pendulum goes to the right, then it moves to
the left, then again to the right, then again to the left; the whole
clock depends on this movement. If the pendulum stays in the middle, the
clock stops. And when the pendulum moves to the right, you think it is
only going to the right, but at the same time it is gathering momentum
to go to the left. The more it moves to the right, the more energy it
gathers to move to the left, to the opposite. When it is moving to the
left it is again gathering momentum to move to the right.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you overeat, you are gathering momentum to go on a fast.
Whenever you overindulge in sex, sooner or later, BRAHMACHARYA,
celibacy, will appeal to you.</p><p>And the same is happening from the opposite pole. Go and ask your
so-called SADHUS, your BHIKKUS, sannyasins. They have made it a point to
remain celibate, now their minds are gathering momentum to move into
sex. They have made a point of being hungry and starving, and their
minds are constantly thinking about food. When you are thinking about
food too much it shows that you are gathering momentum for it. Thinking
means momentum. The mind starts arranging for the opposite.</p><p>One thing: whenever you move, you are also moving to the opposite.
The opposite is hidden, it is not apparent.</p><p><br></p><p>When you love a person you are gathering momentum to hate him. That’s
why only friends can become enemies. You cannot suddenly become an enemy
unless you have first become a friend. Lovers quarrel, fight. Only
lovers can quarrel and fight, because unless you love, how can you hate?
Unless you have moved far to the extreme left, how can you move to the
right? Modern research says that so-called love is a relationship of
intimate enmity. Your wife is your intimate enemy, your husband is your
intimate enemy – both intimate and inimical. They appear opposites,
illogical, because we wonder how one who is intimate can be the enemy;
one who is a friend, how can he also be the foe?</p><p><br></p><p>Logic is superficial, life goes deeper, and in life all opposites are
joined together, they exist together. Remember this, because then
meditation becomes balancing.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha taught eight disciplines, and with each discipline he used the
word right. He said: Right effort, because it is very easy to move from
action to inaction, from waking to sleep, but to remain in the middle is
difficult. When Buddha used the word right he was saying: Don’t move to
the opposite, just stay in the middle. Right food – he never said to
fast. Don’t indulge in too much eating and don’t indulge in fasting. He
said: Right food. Right food means standing in the middle.</p><p>When you are standing in the middle you are not gathering any
momentum. And this is the beauty of it – a man who is not gathering any
momentum to move anywhere, can be at ease with himself, can be at
home.</p><p><br></p><p>You can never be at home, because whatsoever you do you will
immediately have to do the opposite to balance. And the opposite never
balances, it simply gives you the impression that you are becoming
balanced, but you will have to move to the opposite again.</p><p>A buddha is neither a friend to anyone nor an enemy. He has simply
stopped in the middle – the clock is not functioning.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said about one Hassid mystic, Muzheed, that when he attained
enlightenment suddenly the clock on his wall stopped. It may or may not
have happened, because it is possible, but the symbolism is clear: when
your mind stops, time stops; when the pendulum stops, the clock stops.
From then on the clock never moved, from then on it always showed the
same time.</p><p>Time is created by the movement of the mind, just like the movement
of the pendulum. Mind moves, you feel time. When mind is nonmoving, how
can you feel time? When there is no movement, time cannot be felt.
Scientists and mystics agree on this point: that movement creates the
phenomenon of time. If you are not moving, if you are still, time
disappears, eternity comes into existence.</p><p>Your clock is moving fast, and its mechanism is movement from one
extreme to another.</p><p><br></p><p>The second thing to be understood about mind is that the mind always
longs for the distant, never for the near. The near gives you boredom,
you are fed up with it; the distant gives you dreams, hopes, possibility
of pleasure. So the mind always thinks of the distant. It is always
somebody else’s wife who is attractive, beautiful; it is always somebody
else’s house which obsesses you; it is always somebody else’s car which
fascinates you. It is always the distant. You are blind to the near. The
mind cannot see that which is very near. It can only see that which is
very far.</p><p>And what is the furthest, the most distant? The opposite is the most
distant. You love a person – now hatred is the most distant phenomenon;
you are overeating – now fasting is the most distant phenomenon; you are
celibate – now sex is the most distant phenomenon; you are a king – now
to be a monk is the most distant phenomenon.</p><p>The most distant is the most dreamy. It attracts, it obsesses, it
goes on calling, inviting you, and then when you have reached the other
pole, this place from where you have traveled will become beautiful
again. Divorce your wife, and after a few years the wife has again
gained beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>A film actress came to me. She had divorced her husband fifteen years
ago. Now she is old, less beautiful than she was when she and her
husband were separated. Their son was married last year,</p><p><br></p><p>so at the marriage she met her husband again, and they had to travel
together. The husband fell in love with her again, so she came to me and
asked, “What should I do? Now he is proposing again, he wants to get
married to me again.”</p><p>She was also fascinated. She was just waiting for me to say yes. I
said, “But you lived together, there was always conflict and nothing
else. I know the whole story – how you were fighting, quarreling, how
you created hell and misery for each other. Now again...?”</p><p><br></p><p>For the mind the opposite is magnetic, and unless through
understanding you transcend this, the mind will go on moving from left
to right, from right to left, and the clock will continue.</p><p>It has continued for many lives, and this is how you have been
deceiving yourself – because you don’t understand the mechanism. Again
the distant becomes appealing, again you start traveling. The moment you
reach your goal that which you used to know is now distant, now has
appeal, now becomes a star, something worthwhile.</p><p><br></p><p>I was reading about a pilot who was flying over California with a
friend. He told the friend, “Look down</p><p>at that beautiful lake. I was born near it, that is my village.”</p><p>He pointed to a small village just perched in the hills near the
lake, and he said, “I was born there. When I was a child I used to sit
near the lake and fish; fishing was my hobby. But at that time, when I
was a child fishing near the lake, always airplanes used to fly in the
sky, passing overhead, and I would dream of the day when I would become
a pilot myself, I would be piloting an airplane. That was my only dream.
Now it is fulfilled, and what misery! Now I am continuously looking down
at the lake and thinking about when I will retire and go fishing again.
That lake is so beautiful<span class=s5></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>This is how things are happening. This is how things are happening to
you. In childhood, you long to grow up fast because older people are
more powerful. A child longs to grow up immediately. Old people are
wise, and the child feels that whatsoever he does, it is always wrong.
And then ask the old man – he always thinks that when childhood was
lost, everything was lost; paradise was there in childhood. And all the
old men die thinking of childhood, the innocence, the beauty, the
dreamland.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever you have looks useless, whatsoever you don’t have looks
useful. Remember this, otherwise meditation cannot happen, because
meditation means this understanding of the mind, the working of the
mind, the very process of the mind.</p><p>The mind is dialectical, it makes you move again and again towards
the opposite. And this is an infinite process, it never ends unless you
suddenly drop out of it, unless you suddenly become aware of the game,
unless you suddenly become aware of the trick of the mind, and you stop
in the middle.</p><p><br></p><p>Stopping in the middle is meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Thirdly, because mind consists of polarities, you are never whole.
The mind cannot be whole; it is always half. When you love someone have
you observed that you are suppressing your hatred? The love is not
total, it is not whole; just behind it all the dark forces are hidden
and they may erupt any moment. You are sitting on a volcano.</p><p><br></p><p>When you love someone, you simply forget that you have anger, you
have hate, you have jealousy. You simply drop them as if they never
existed. But how can you drop them? You can simply hide them in the
unconscious. Just on the surface you can become loving, deep down the
turmoil is hidden. Sooner or later you will be fed up, the beloved will
become familiar.</p><p>They say that familiarity breeds contempt, but it is not that
familiarity breeds contempt – familiarity makes you bored, contempt has
always been there, hidden. It comes up, it was waiting for the right
moment; the seed was there.</p><p>The mind always has the opposite within it, and that opposite goes
into the unconscious and waits for its moment to come up. If you observe
minutely, you will feel it every moment. When you say to someone, I love
you, close your eyes, be meditative, and feel – is there any hatred
hidden? You will feel it. But because you want to deceive yourself,
because the truth is so ugly – the truth that you hate a person that you
love – you don’t want to face it. You want to escape from real-ity, so
you hide it. But hiding won’t help, because it is not deceiving somebody
else, it is deceiving yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>So whenever you feel something, just close the eyes and go into
yourself to find the opposite somewhere. It is there. And if you can see
the opposite, that will give you a balance, then you will not say, “I
love you.” If you are truthful you will say, “My relationship with you
is of love and hate.”</p><p><br></p><p>All relationships are love/hate relationships. No relationship is of
pure love, and no relationship is of pure hate. It is both love and
hate. If you are truthful you will be in difficulty. If you say to a
girl, “My relationship with you is of both love and hate. I love you as
I have never loved anybody and I hate you as I have never hated
anybody,” it will be difficult for you to get married unless you find a
meditative girl who can understand the reality; unless you can find a
friend who can understand the complexity of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is not a simple mechanism, it is very complex, and through mind
you can never become simple because mind goes on creating deceptions. To
be meditative means to be aware of the fact that mind is hiding
something from you, you are closing your eyes to some facts which are
disturbing. Sooner or later those disturbing facts will erupt, overpower
you, and you will move to the opposite. And the opposite is not there in
a distant faraway place, in some star; the opposite is hidden behind
you, in you, in your mind, in the very functioning of the mind. If you
can understand this, you will stop in the middle.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can see I love and I hate, suddenly both will disappear,
because both cannot exist together in the consciousness. You have to
create a barrier: one has to exist in the unconscious and one in the
conscious. Both cannot exist in the conscious, they will negate each
other. The love will destroy hate, the hate will destroy love; they will
balance each other, and they will simply disappear. The same amount of
hate and the same amount of love will negate each other. Suddenly they
will evaporate – you will be there, but no love and no hate. Then you
are balanced.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are balanced, mind is not there – then you are whole. When
you are whole, you are holy, but mind is not there. So meditation is a
state of no-mind. Through mind it is not achieved. Through mind,
whatever you do, it can never be achieved. Then what are you doing when
you are meditating?</p><p><br></p><p>Because you have created so much tension in your life, you are now
meditating. But this is the opposite of tension, not real meditation.
You are so tense that meditation has become attractive. That is why in
the West meditation appeals more than in the East, because more tension
exists there than in the East. The East is still relaxed, people are not
so tense, they don’t go mad so easily, they don’t commit suicide so
easily. They are not so violent, not so aggressive, not so scared, not
so fearful – no, they are not so tense. They are not living at such a
mad speed where nothing but tension is accumulated.</p><p>So if Mahesh Yogi comes to India, nobody listens. But in America,
people are mad about him. When there is much tension, meditation will
appeal. But this appeal is again falling into the same trap. This is not
real meditation, this is again a trick. You meditate for a few days, you
become relaxed; when you become relaxed, again the need for activity
arises, and the mind starts thinking of doing something, of moving. You
get bored with it.</p><p>People come to me and say, “We meditated for a few years, then it
became boring, then there was</p><p>no more fun.”</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day a girl came to me and said, “Now meditation is not
fun anymore, what should I do?”</p><p>Now the mind is seeking something else, now it has had enough of
meditation. Now that she is at ease, the mind is asking for more
tensions – something to get disturbed about. When she says that now
meditation is no more fun, she means that now the tension is not there,
so how can the meditation be fun? She will have to move into tension
again, then meditation will again become something worthwhile.</p><p>Look at the absurdity of the mind: you have to go away to come near,
you have to become tense to be meditative. But then this is not
meditation, then again this is a trick of the same mind; on a new level
the same game continues.</p><p><br></p><p>When I say meditation, I mean going beyond the game of the polar
opposites; dropping out of the whole game, looking at the absurdity of
it and transcending it. The very understanding becomes
transcendence.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind will force you to move to the opposite – don’t move to the
opposite. Stop in the middle and see that this has always been the trick
of the mind. This is how mind has dominated you – through the opposite.
Have you felt it?</p><p>After making love to a woman you suddenly start thinking of
brahmacharya, and brahmacharya has such an alluring fascination at that
moment that you feel as if there is nothing else to achieve. You feel
frustrated, deceived, you feel that there was nothing in this sex, only
brahmacharya has the bliss. But after twenty-four hours, sex again
becomes important, significant, and again you have to move into it.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the mind doing? After the sex act it started thinking about
the opposite, which again creates the taste for sex.</p><p><br></p><p>A violent man starts thinking about nonviolence, then he can be
violent again easily. A man who gets angry again and again always thinks
of non-anger, always decides not to be angry again. This decision helps
him to be angry again.</p><p>If you really want not to be angry again don’t decide against anger.
Just look into the anger and just look at the shadow of the anger which
you think is non-anger. Look into sex, and at the shadow of sex, which
you think is brahmacharya, celibacy. It is just negativity, absence.
Look at overeating, and the shadow of it – fasting. Fasting always
follows overeating; overindulgence is always followed by vows of
celibacy; tension is always followed by some techniques of meditation.
Look at them together, feel how they are related; they are part of one
process.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can understand this, meditation will happen to you. Really, it
is not something to be done, it is a point of understanding. It is not
an effort, it is nothing to be cultivated. It is something to be deeply
understood.</p><p><br></p><p>Understanding gives freedom. Knowledge of the whole mechanism of the
mind is transformation. Then suddenly the clock stops, time disappears:
and with the stopping of the clock, there is no mind. With the stopping
of time, where are you? The boat is empty.</p><p>Now we will enter this sutra of Chuang Tzu:</p><p><br></p><p>THE MAN OF TAO ACTS WITHOUT IMPEDIMENT, HARMS NO OTHER BEING BY HIS
ACTIONS,</p><p>YET HE DOES NOT KNOW HIMSELF TO BE KIND AND GENTLE.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MAN OF TAO ACTS WITHOUT IMPEDIMENT You act always with
impediment, the opposite</p><p>is always there creating the impediment; you are not a flow.</p><p><br></p><p>If you love, the hate is always there as an impediment. If you move,
something is holding you back; you never move totally, something is
always left, the movement is not total. You move with one leg but the
other leg is not moving. How can you move? The impediment is there.</p><p><br></p><p>And this impediment, this continuous moving of the half and nonmoving
of the other half, is your anguish, your anxiety. Why are you in so much
anguish? What creates so much anxiety in you? Whatsoever you do, why is
bliss not happening through it? Bliss can happen only to the whole,
never to the part.</p><p>When the whole moves without any impediment the very movement is
bliss. Bliss is not something that comes from outside – it is the
feeling that comes when your whole being moves, the very movement of the
whole is bliss. It is not something happening to you, it arises out of
you, it is a harmony in your being.</p><p>If you are divided – and you are always divided: half-moving,
half-withholding, half saying yes, half saying no, half in love, half in
hate, you are a divided kingdom – there is constant conflict in you. You
say something but you never mean it, because the opposite is there
impeding, creating a hindrance.</p><p><br></p><p>Baal Shem’s disciples used to write down whatsoever he said, and Baal
Shem used to say: I know that whatsoever you are writing is not what has
been said by me. You have heard one thing, I have said something else,
and you are writing still something else. And if you look at the
meaning, the meaning is something else again. You will never do what you
have written, you will do something else – fragments, not an integrated
being.</p><p>Why are these fragments there?</p><p><br></p><p>Have you heard the story about the centipede? A centipede was walking
along on his one hundred legs – that is why he is called a centipede. It
is a miracle to walk with a hundred feet, even to manage two is so
difficult! To manage one hundred legs is really almost impossible. But
the centipede has been managing to do it!</p><p><br></p><p>A fox became curious – and foxes are always curious. The fox is the
symbol in folklore of the mind, of the intellect, of logic. Foxes are
great logicians.The fox looked, she observed, she analyzed, she couldn’t
believe it. She said, “Wait! I have a question. How do you manage, and
how do you know which foot has to follow which? One hundred legs! You
walk so smoothly. How does this harmony happen?”</p><p>The centipede said, “I have been walking all my life but I have never
thought about it. Give me a little</p><p>time.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he closed his eyes and for the first time he became divided: the
mind as observer, and himself as the observed. For the first time the
centipede became two. He had always been living and walking, and his
life was one whole; there was no observer standing looking at himself,
he was never divided, he had been an integrated being. Now, for the
first time, division arose. He was looking at his own self, thinking. He
had become subject and object, he had become two, and then he started
walking. It was difficult, almost impossible. He fell down – because how
do you manage one hundred legs?</p><p><br></p><p>The fox laughed and he said, “I knew it must be difficult, I knew it
beforehand.”</p><p>The centipede started crying and weeping. With tears in his eyes he
said, “It has never been difficult before, but you have created the
problem. Now I will never be able to walk again.”</p><p><br></p><p>The mind has come into being; it comes into being when you are
divided. The mind feeds on division. That is why Krishnamurti keeps
saying that when the observer has become the observed you are in
meditation.</p><p>The opposite happened to the centipede. The wholeness was lost, he
became two: the observer and the observed, divided; the subject and the
object, the thinker and the thought. Then everything was disturbed, then
bliss was lost and the flow stopped. Then he got frozen.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever the mind comes in, it comes as a controlling force, a
manager. It is not the master, it is the manager. And you cannot get to
the master unless this manager is put aside.The manager won’t allow you
to reach the master, the manager will always be standing in the doorway
managing. And all managers only mismanage – mind has done such a great
job of mismanaging.</p><p><br></p><p>Poor centipede. He had always been happy. He had no problems at all.
He lived, moved, loved, everything, no problems at all, because there
was no mind. Mind came in with the problem, with the question, with the
inquiry. And there are many foxes around you. Beware of them –
philosophers, theologians, logicians, professors all around you – foxes.
They ask you questions and they create a disturbance.</p><p>Chuang Tzu’s master, Lao Tzu, said: When there was not a single
philosopher, everything was solved, there were no questions, and all
answers were available. When philosophers arose, questions came and
answers disappeared. Whenever there is a question the answer is very far
away. Whenever you ask, you will never get the answer, but when you stop
asking, you will find that the answer has always been there.</p><p><br></p><p>I do not know what happened to this centipede. If he was as foolish
as human beings, he would be somewhere in a hospital, crippled,
paralyzed forever. But I don’t think that centipedes are so foolish. He
must have thrown the question out. He must have told the fox, “Keep your
questions to yourself, and let me walk.” He must have come to know that
division wouldn’t allow him to live, because division creates death.
Undivided you are life, divided you become dead – the more divided, the
more dead.</p><p>What is bliss? Bliss is the feeling that comes to you when the
obser-ver has become the observed. Bliss is the feeling that comes to
you when you are in harmony, not fragmented; one, not disintegrated, not
divided. Feeling is not something that happens from the outside. It is
the melody that arises out of your inner harmoniousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Says Chuang Tzu:</p><p>THE MAN OF TAO ACTS WITHOUT IMPEDIMENT.…</p><p><br></p><p>He is not divided so who is there to impede? What is there to
function as an impediment? He is alone, he moves with his wholeness.
This movement in wholeness is the greatest beauty that can happen, that
is possible. Sometimes you have glimpses of it. Sometimes when you are
suddenly whole, when the mind is not functioning, it happens.</p><p>The sun is rising...suddenly you look, and the observer is not there.
The sun is not there and you are not there, there is no observer and no
observed. Simply the sun is rising and your mind is not there to manage.
You don’t see it and say, “The sun is beautiful.” The moment you say it
the bliss is lost. Then there is no bliss, it has already become the
past, it is already gone.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly you see the sun rising, and the seer is not there; the seer
has not yet come into being, it has not become a thought. You have not
looked, you have not analyzed, you have not observed. The sun is rising
and there is no one, the boat is empty; there is bliss, a glimpse. But
the mind immediately comes in, and says, “The sun is beautiful, this
sunrise is so beautiful.” The comparison has come in and the beauty is
lost.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who know say that whenever you say “I love you” to a person,
the love is lost. The love has already gone because the lover has come
in. How can love exist when the division, the manager, has come in? It
is the mind which says “I love you,” because, really, in love there is
no I and no thou. In love there are no individuals. Love is a melting, a
merging, they are not two.</p><p><br></p><p>Love exists, not the lovers. In love, love exists not the lovers, but
the mind comes in and says, “I am in love, I love you.” When ‘I’ comes,
doubt enters; division comes in and love is there no more.</p><p>You will come many times to such glimpses in your meditation.
Remember, whenever you feel such a glimpse, don’t say, “How beautiful!”
don’t say, “How lovely!” because this is how you will lose it. Whenever
the glimpse comes, let the glimpse be there. Don’t do what the centipede
did – don’t raise any question, don’t make any observation, don’t
analyze, don’t allow the mind to come in. Walk with a hundred legs, but
don’t think about how you are walking.</p><p>When in meditation you have the glimpse of some ecstasy, let it
happen, let it go deep. Don’t divide yourself. Don’t make any statement,
otherwise the contact is lost.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes you have glimpses, but you have become so efficient at
losing your contact with those glimpses that you cannot understand how
they come and how you lose them again. They come when you are not, you
lose them when you come again. When you are, they are not. When the boat
is empty, bliss is always happening. It is not an accident, it is the
very nature of existence. It doesn’t depend on anything – it is a
showering, it is the very breath of life.</p><p>It is really a miracle how you have managed to be so miserable, so
thirsty, when it is raining everywhere. You have really done the
impossible! Light is everywhere and you live in darkness; death is
nowhere and you are constantly dying; life is a benediction and you are
in hell.</p><p><br></p><p>How have you managed it? Through division, through thinking.…
Thinking depends on division, analysis; meditation is when there is no
analysis, no division, when everything has become synthesized, when
everything has become one.</p><p>Says Chuang Tzu:</p><p><br></p><p>THE MAN OF TAO ACTS WITHOUT IMPEDIMENT, HARMS NO OTHER BEING BY HIS
ACTIONS.</p><p>How can he do harm? You can harm others only when you have already
harmed yourself. Remember this; this is the secret. If you harm
yourself, you will harm others. And you will harm even when you think
you are doing good to others. Nothing can happen through you but harm,
because one who lives with wounds, one who lives in anguish and misery,
whatsoever he does he will create more misery and anguish for others.
You can give only that which you have got.</p><p>I have heard that once a beggar came to a synagogue and he told the
rabbi, “I am a great musician, and I have heard that the musician who
belonged to this synagogue is dead, and you are looking for another. So
I offer myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>The rabbi and the congregation were happy because they were really
missing their music. Then the man played – it was horrible! It was more
musical without his music. He created a hell. It was impossible to feel
any silence in that synagogue that morning. He had to be stopped,
because most of the congregation started to leave. People escaped as
fast as they could because his music was just anarchic, it was like
madness, and it started to affect people.</p><p><br></p><p>When the rabbi heard that everybody was leaving, he went to the man
and stopped him. The man</p><p>said, “If you don’t want me, you can pay for this morning and then I
will go.”</p><p><br></p><p>The rabbi said, “It is impossible to pay you, we have never
experienced such a horrible thing.” Then the musician said, “Okay, then
keep it as a contribution from me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The rabbi said, “But how can you contribute what you don’t possess?
You don’t have any music at all – how can you contribute? You can
contribute something only when you have got it. This is no music;
rather, on the contrary, it is something like antimusic. So please take
it away with you, don’t contribute it to us or it will go on haunting
us.”</p><p><br></p><p>You give only that which you have. You always give your being. If you
are dead within, you cannot help life; wherever you go you will kill.
Knowingly, unknowingly, that is not the point – you may think that you
are helping others to live, but still you will kill.</p><p><br></p><p>A great psychoanalyst, Wilhelm Reich, who was studying children and
their problems, was asked once, “What is the most basic problem with
children? What do you find at the root of all their miseries, problems,
abnormalities?”</p><p>He said, “The mothers.”</p><p><br></p><p>No mother can agree with this, because every mother feels that she is
just helping her children without any selfishness on her part. She is
living and dying for the child. And psychoanalysts say mothers are the
problem. Unknowingly they are killing, crippling; knowingly they think
they are loving.</p><p>If you are crippled within, you will cripple your children. You
cannot do anything else, you can’t help it, because you give out of your
being – there is no other way to give.</p><p>Says Chuang Tzu: THE MAN OF TAO...HARMS NO OTHER BEING BY HIS
ACTIONS. Not that he</p><p>cultivates nonviolence, not that he cultivates compassion, not that
he lives a good life, not that he behaves in a saintly way – no. He
cannot harm because he has stopped harming himself. He has no wounds. He
is so blissful that from his actions or inactions only bliss flows. Even
though it may appear sometimes that he is doing something wrong, he
cannot.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just the opposite with you. Sometimes it appears that you are
doing something good. You cannot. The man of Tao cannot do harm, it is
impossible. There is no way to do it, it is inconceivable – because he
is without divisions, fragments. He is not a crowd, he is not
polypsychic. He is a universe now and nothing other than melody is
happening inside. Only this music goes on spreading.</p><p><br></p><p>The man of Tao is not one of much action – he is not a man of action,
the least possible action happens through him. He is really a man of
inaction, he is not much occupied with activity.</p><p>But you are occupied with activity just to escape from yourself. You
cannot tolerate yourself, you cannot tolerate the company of yourself.
You keep looking for somebody as an escape, some occupation in which you
can forget yourself, in which you can get involved. You are so bored
with yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of Tao, a man who has attained the inner nature, a man who is
really religious, is not a man of much activity. Only the necessary will
happen. The unnecessary is cut out completely, because he can be at ease
without activity, he can be at home without doing anything, he can
relax, he can be company for himself, he can be with his self.</p><p>You cannot be with yourself, hence the constant urge to seek company.
Go to a club, go to a meeting, go to a party, move into the crowd, where
you are not alone. You are so afraid of yourself that if you are left
alone you will go mad. In just three weeks if you are left absolutely
alone without any activity, you will go mad. And this is not something
said by religious people, now psychologists agree to it. For only three
weeks, if all activity, if all company, is taken from you, if you are
left alone in a room, within three weeks you will be mad – because all
your activity is just to throw out your madness, it is a catharsis.</p><p><br></p><p>What will you do when you are alone? For the first three or four days
you will dream and talk within, an inner chattering. Then this will
become boring. After the first week you will start talking aloud because
at least you will hear the sound of your own voice. When you walk along
a dark street at night you start whistling. Why? How is this whistling
going to give you courage? How is this whistling going to help you? Just
listening to it you feel that you are not alone, somebody is whistling.
The illusion of two is created!</p><p><br></p><p>After the first week you will start talking aloud because then you
can also listen. You are not alone, you are talking and you are
listening as if somebody else is talking to you. After the second week
you will start answering yourself. You will not only talk, you will
answer – you are divided. Now you are two; one who questions, one who
answers. Now there is a dialogue – you have gone completely crazy.</p><p>A man asked his psychiatrist, “I am very worried, I talk to myself.
What should I do? Can you help me?”</p><p><br></p><p>The psychiatrist said, “This is nothing to be worried about.
Everybody talks to himself, this is not a big</p><p>problem. Only when you start answering, then come to me, then I can
be of help.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the difference is only of degree; it is not of kind, it is only
of quantity. If you start talking to yourself, sooner or later you will
start answering also, because how can one go on simply talking? The
answer is needed, otherwise you will feel foolish. By the third week you
start answering – you have gone crazy.</p><p><br></p><p>This world, the world of activity, business and occupation, saves you
from the madhouse. If you are occupied, energy moves out; then you need
not care about the inward, the inner world, you can forget it.</p><p>A man of Tao is not a man of much activity – only the essential
activity. It is said of Chuang Tzu that if he could stand, he would not
walk, if he could sit, he would not stand, if he could fall asleep, he
would not sit. The essential, the most essential, only the must would he
do, because there is no madness in it.</p><p><br></p><p>You do the nonessential, you keep on doing the nonessential. Look at
your activities: ninety-nine percent are nonessential. You can drop
them, you can save much energy, you can save much time.</p><p><br></p><p>But you cannot drop them because you are afraid, you are scared of
yourself. If there is no radio, no television, no newspaper, nobody to
talk to, what will you do?</p><p>I have heard about a priest who died. Of course, he expected to go to
paradise, to heaven. He arrived there and everything was beautiful. The
house he entered was one of the most wonderful ever dreamed of,
palatial. And the moment a desire came, immediately a servant appeared.
If he was hungry, a servant was there with the food, the most delicious
he had ever tasted. If he was thirsty, even before the desire had become
a thought, while it was just the feeling, a man would appear with
drinks.</p><p><br></p><p>So it continued and he was very happy for two or three days, and then
he began to feel uneasy because a man has to do something, you cannot
just sit in a chair. Only a man of Tao can just sit in a chair and go on
sitting and sitting and sitting. You cannot.</p><p>The priest became uneasy. For two or three days it is okay as a
holiday, as a rest. He had been so active – so much public service,
mission, church, delivering sermons; he had been so involved with
society and the community, so he rested. But how much can you rest?
Unless your being is at rest, sooner or later the holiday ends, and you
have to come back to the world. Uneasiness arose; he started feeling
discomfort.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly the servant appeared and asked, “What do you want? This
feeling of yours is not a want, you are neither thirsty nor hungry, just
uneasy. So what should I do?”</p><p>The priest said, “I cannot sit here forever and forever, for
eternity, I want some activity.”</p><p><br></p><p>The servant said, “That is impossible. All your desires will be
fulfilled here by us, so what need is there for activity? There is no
need, that is why it is not provided here.”</p><p>The priest became very uneasy and he said, “What type of heaven is
this?”</p><p><br></p><p>The servant replied, “Who said this is heaven? This is hell. Who told
you this is heaven?”</p><p><br></p><p>And this really was hell. Now he understood: without activity, this
was hell. He must have gone mad sooner or later. No communication or
talk, no social service to be done, no pagans to be converted to
Christianity, no foolish people to be made wise – what could he do?</p><p>Only a man of Tao could have changed that hell into a heaven. A man
of Tao, wherever he is, is at peace, at ease. Only the essential is
done, and if you can do the essential for him, he is happy. The
nonessential is dropped.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot drop the nonessential. Really, ninety-nine percent of your
energy is wasted on the nonessential. The essential is not enough, and
the mind always hankers for the nonessential, because the essential is
so little, so small, it can be fulfilled easily. Then what will you
do?</p><p><br></p><p>People are not very interested in having good food. They are more
interested in having a big car because good food can be attained very
easily. Then what? People are not interested in having good healthy
bodies. That can be attained very easily. They are interested in
something which</p><p><br></p><p>cannot be attained so easily, something impossible, and the
nonessential is always the impossible. There are always bigger houses,
bigger cars, they go on getting bigger and bigger and you are never
allowed to rest.</p><p>The whole world is trying to fulfill the nonessential. Ninety percent
of industry is involved with the nonessential. Fifty percent of human
labor is wasted on that which is not useful in any way. Fifty percent of
industry is devoted to the feminine mind, rather, feminine body:
designing new dresses every three months, designing new houses, clothes,
powders, soaps, creams; fifty percent of industry is devoted to such
nonsense. And humanity is starving, people are dying without food, and
half of humanity is interested in the absolutely nonessential.</p><p><br></p><p>To reach the moon is absolutely nonessential. If we were a little
wiser we would not even think about it. It is absolutely foolish wasting
as much money as could feed the whole earth. Wars are nonessential, but
humanity is mad, and it needs wars more than food. It needs to go to the
moon more than food, more than clothes, more than the essential, because
the essential is not enough.</p><p><br></p><p>And now science has created the greatest horror, and that horror is
that now the essential can be fulfilled very easily. Within ten years,
all humanity’s needs can be fulfilled, this whole earth can be satisfied
as far as the necessities are concerned. Then what? Then what will you
do? You will feel in the same position as the priest. He thought that he
was in heaven, and then he found that it was hell. Within ten years the
whole earth can become a hell.</p><p><br></p><p>The nonessential is needed for your madness to remain engaged. So
moons are not enough, we will have to go further, we will have to go on
creating the useless. It is needed. People need it to be occupied.</p><p>A man of Tao is not a man of much activity. His actions are the most
essential – those which cannot be avoided. That which can be avoided, he
avoids. He is so happy with himself there is no need to move in actions.
His activity is like inactivity; he does without there being anybody
doing.</p><p><br></p><p>He is an empty boat, moving on the sea, not going anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>YET HE DOES NOT KNOW HIMSELF TO BE KIND AND GENTLE.</p><p><br></p><p>Allow this point to penetrate deep into your heart. YET HE DOES NOT
KNOW HIMSELF TO BE KIND AND GENTLE – because if you know, you have
missed the point; if you know that you are a simple man, you are not.
This knowledge makes it complex. If you know that you are a man of
religion, you are not, because this cunning mind which knows is still
there.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are gentle, and you don’t know, when you are simple, and you
are not aware of it, it has become your nature. When something is really
natural you are not aware of it, but when something is imposed, you are
aware of it. When somebody becomes rich, newly rich, he is aware of his
house, of his swimming pool, of his riches, and you can see that he is
not an aristocrat, because he is so concerned with show.</p><p>A newly rich man ordered three swimming pools for his garden. They
were made and he was showing them to a friend. The friend was a little
puzzled. He said, “Three swimming pools? For what? One will do.”</p><p><br></p><p>The newly rich man said, “No, how can one do? One for hot baths, one
for cold baths.”</p><p><br></p><p>His friend asked, “And the third?”</p><p><br></p><p>He answered, “For those who cannot swim. So the third swimming pool
is going to stay empty.”</p><p><br></p><p>You can see if a man has newly acquired wealth – he will be showing
it. A real aristocrat is one who has forgotten that he is rich. A man of
Tao is the aristocrat of the inner world.</p><p><br></p><p>If a person shows his religion he is not yet really religious. The
religion is still like a thorn, it is not natural, it hurts, he is eager
to show it. If you want to show your simplicity what type of simplicity
is this? If you exhibit your gentleness, then it is simply cunning,
nothing gentle exists in it.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of Tao is an aristocrat of the inner world. He is so attuned to
it, there is no exhibition – not only to you, he himself is not aware of
it. He does not know that he is wise, he does not know that he is
innocent – how can you know if you are innocent? Your knowledge will
disturb the innocence.</p><p>A follower of Hazrat Mohammed went with him to the mosque for early
morning prayer. It was summer, and on the way back they saw many people
still asleep in their houses or just on the street. It was early
morning, a summer morning, and many people were still asleep. The man
very arrogantly said to Hazrat Mohammed, “What will happen to these
sinners? They have not been to the morning prayer.”</p><p><br></p><p>Today was the first time he himself had gone to prayer. Yesterday he
was also asleep like these sinners. The newly rich man wanted to
exhi-bit, to show off to Mohammed: “Mohammed Hazrat, what will happen to
these sinners? They have not been to the morning prayer, they are still
lazy and asleep.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mohammed stopped and said, “You go home, I will have to go back to
the mosque again.” The man said, “Why?”</p><p>He replied, “My morning prayer is wasted because of you; keeping
company with you has destroyed everything. I will have to do my prayer
again. And as for you, remember please never to come again. It was
better for you to be asleep like the others; at least they were not
sinners then. Your prayer has done only one thing – it has given you the
key to condemn others.”</p><p><br></p><p>The so-called religious person is religious only to look at you with
a condemning eye so he can say that you are sinners. Go to your saints,
so-called saints, and look into their eyes. You will not find the
innocence that should be there. You will find a calculating mind looking
at you and thinking about hell: You will be thrown in hell and I will be
in heaven, because I have been praying so much, five times a day, and I
have been fasting so much. As if you can purchase heaven...! These are
the coins – fasting, prayer – these are the coins one is trying to
bargain with.</p><p>If you see condemnation in the eyes of a saint, know well that he is
a newly rich man; he is not yet an aristocrat of the inner world, he has
not yet become one with it. He may know it – but you know something only
when it is separate from you.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing has to be remembered here: because of this, self-knowledge
is impossible. You cannot know the self, because whenever you know it,
it is not the self, it is something else, something separate from you.
The self is always the knower, never the known, so how can you know it?
You cannot reduce it to an object.</p><p>I can see you. How can I see myself? Then who will be the seer and
who will be the seen? No, the self cannot be known in the same way that
other things are known.</p><p><br></p><p>Self-knowledge is not possible in the ordinary sense, because the
knower always transcends, always goes beyond. Whatsoever it knows, it is
not that. The Upanishads say: NETI NETI – not this, not that. Whatsoever
you know, you are not this; whatsoever you don’t know, you are not that
either. You are the one who knows, and this knower cannot be reduced to
a known object.</p><p><br></p><p>Self-knowledge is not possible. If your innocence comes out of your
inner source you cannot know it. If you have imposed it from the outside
you can know it; if it is just like a dress you have put on you know it,
but it is not the very breath of your life. That innocence is
cultivated, and a cultivated innocence is an ugly thing.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of Tao does not know himself to be kind and gentle. He IS
gentle, but he doesn’t know; he is kind, but he doesn’t know; he is
love, but he doesn’t know – because the lover and the knower are not
two, the gentleness, the kindness, the compassion and the knower, are
not two. No, they cannot be divided into the known and the knower. This
is the inner aristocracy: when you have become so rich you are not aware
of it. When you are that rich, there is no need to exhibit it.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard:</p><p>It happened once that Henry Ford came to England. At the airport
inquiry office he asked for the cheapest hotel in town. The clerk in the
office looked – the face was famous. Henry Ford was known all over the
world. Just the day before there were big pictures of him in the
newspapers saying that he was coming. And here he was, asking for the
cheapest hotel, wearing a coat that looked as old as he himself.</p><p><br></p><p>So the clerk said, “If I am not mistaken, you are Mr. Henry Ford. I
remember well, I have seen your picture.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “Yes.”</p><p><br></p><p>This puzzled the clerk very much, and he said, “You are asking for
the cheapest hotel, wearing a coat that looks as old as you yourself. I
have also seen your son coming here, and he always inquires about the
best hotel, and he comes in the best of clothes.”</p><p>Henry Ford is reported to have said, “Yes, my son’s behavior is
exhibitionist, he is not yet attuned. There is no need for me to stay in
a costly hotel; wherever I stay I am Henry Ford. Even in the cheapest
hotel I am Henry Ford, it makes no difference. My son is still new,
afraid of what people will think if he stays in a cheap hotel. And this
coat, yes, this belonged to my father – but it makes no difference, I
don’t need new clothes. I am Henry Ford, whatsoever the dress; even if I
am standing naked, I am Henry Ford. It makes no difference at all.”</p><p><br></p><p>When you are really attuned, really rich in the inner world, you are
not concerned with exhibition. When you first go to a temple, your
prayer is a little louder than others. It has to be. You want to show
off.</p><p>The showmanship is part of the ego, what you show is not the problem.
You show, you exhibit. Then the ego is there, the boat is not empty –
and a man of Tao is an empty boat. He is gentle, not aware; he is
innocent, not knowing; he is wise, that’s why he can move as a fool, not
worried. Whatsoever he does makes no difference, his wisdom is intact,
he can afford to be foolish. You cannot.</p><p><br></p><p>You are always afraid that somebody may think you a fool. You are
afraid that if others think you to be a fool, you will start suspecting
it. If so many people think you a fool your self-confidence will be
lost. And if everybody goes on repeating that you are a fool, sooner or
later you will come to believe it.</p><p><br></p><p>Only a wise man cannot be deceived, he can appear as a fool.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about one wise man who was known as The Madman. Nobody
knew anything else about him, his name or anything, he was just known as
The Madman. He was a Jew, and Jews have created a few really wise men,
they have something of the inner source. That is why Jesus could be born
amongst them.</p><p><br></p><p>This madman behaved in such a foolish way that the whole community
became disturbed because nobody knew what he was going to do next. On
the religious days, Yom Kippur or other festivals, the whole community
was afraid, because it could not be predicted what this rabbi would do,
how he would appear there, how he would behave. His prayers were also
mad.</p><p><br></p><p>Once he called the court, the Jewish court, all the ten judges of the
court. The court came, because the rabbi called, and he said, “I have a
case against God, so decide how to punish this fellow God. I will
present all the arguments to prove that God is unjust and a
criminal.”</p><p><br></p><p>The judges became very much afraid but they had to listen because he
was the rabbi, the head of the temple. And he made out his case like a
lawyer in court.</p><p>He said, “God, you created the world, and now you send messengers
telling us how to renounce it. What foolishness! You gave us desires and
now all your teachers keep coming and saying: Be desireless. So what do
you think you are doing? And if we have committed any sins it is really
YOU who are the culprit, because why did you create desire?”</p><p><br></p><p>What should the court decide? He was right, but the court decided
that this man had gone completely mad and should be expelled from the
temple.</p><p><br></p><p>But this man is really telling the truth. He loves God so much that
it is an I/thou relationship, so intimate. He asks, “What are you doing?
Enough, now stop, no more fooling.” He must have loved the divine so
much that he could behave in that way.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is said that God immediately stopped when he called. He had to
listen to this man.</p><p><br></p><p>And the angels asked, “Suddenly you stopped, what happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That madman is praying. I have to listen, because
whatsoever he says is true, and he loves me so much that there is no
need for formality.…” In love, in hate, everything is permitted,
everything is allowed.</p><p>This madman was passing and a woman came to him. She asked, “I have
been longing and longing for a child for forty years now. And if within
three or four years a child does not come, then it will not be possible.
So help me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The madman said, “I can help, because my mother had the same trouble.
She waited and waited for forty years and no child came. Then she went
to Baal Shem, a mystic; she told him, and he intervened. My mother gave
him a beautiful cap. Baal Shem put the cap on his head, looked up and
said to God, ‘What are you doing? This is unjust. There is nothing wrong
in the demand of this woman, so give her a child.’ And after nine
months, I was born.”</p><p>So the woman said, beaming and happy, “I will go home and I will
bring you a more beautiful cap than you have ever seen. Then will the
child be born to me?”</p><p><br></p><p>Said the madman, “You have missed the point. My mother never knew the
story. Your cap won’t do, you have missed. You cannot imitate religion,
you cannot imitate prayer. Once you imitate you have missed.” So
whenever people came to this madman, he would say, “Don’t imitate, throw
away all the scriptures.”</p><p>When this madman died he had all the books that had been written
about him burned. And the last thing he did was to say to his disciples,
“Go around the house and search, and tell me that nothing is left, so
that I can die at ease. Not even a single letter written by me should be
left; otherwise after I die people will start following, and when you
follow, you miss.” So everything was gathered and burned. Then he said,
“Now I can die easily, I am not leaving any traces behind.”</p><p>This type of wise man is not afraid. How can a wise man be afraid of
anybody? He can to all appearances be a fool, he need not exhibit his
wisdom.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you observed yourself? You are always trying to exhibit your
wisdom, always in search of a victim to whom you can show your
knowledge, just searching, hunting for somebody weaker than you – then
you will jump in and you will show your wisdom.</p><p><br></p><p>A wise man need not be an exhibitionist. Whatsoever is, is. He is not
aware of it, he is not in any hurry to show it. If you want to find it,
you will have to make efforts. If you have to know whether he is gentle
or not, that is going to be your discovery.</p><p><br></p><p>HE DOES NOT STRUGGLE TO MAKE MONEY,</p><p>AND HE DOES NOT MAKE A VIRTUE OUT OF POVERTY.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember this. It is very easy to make money and it is also very easy
to make a virtue of poverty. But these two types are not different. A
man keeps on making money, and then suddenly he gets frustrated. He has
achieved, and nothing is gained – so he renounces. Then poverty becomes
the virtue, then he lives the life of a poor man and then he says: This
is the only real life, this is religious</p><p><br></p><p>life. This man is the same, nothing has changed. The pendulum moved
to the left but now has gone to the other extreme.</p><p>HE DOES NOT STRUGGLE TO MAKE MONEY.…</p><p><br></p><p>This you will understand; the other part is more difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>...HE DOES NOT MAKE A VIRTUE OUT OF POVERTY.</p><p>He is neither poor nor rich. He is not making any effort to make
money, he is not making any effort to be poor – whatever happens he
allows it to happen. If a palace happens, he will be in the palace; if
the palace disappears, he will not look for it. Whatever is happening,
he will be with it, his bliss cannot be disturbed. He is not struggling
for money, he is not struggling for poverty.</p><p><br></p><p>HE GOES HIS WAY WITHOUT RELYING ON OTHERS.…</p><p><br></p><p>This you can understand easily.</p><p><br></p><p>HE GOES HIS WAY WITHOUT RELYING ON OTHERS, AND DOES NOT PRIDE HIMSELF
ON WALKING ALONE.</p><p>You depend on others, your wife, your children, your father, mother,
friends, society; then suddenly you drop everything and escape to the
Himalayas. Then you start priding yourself: I live alone, I don’t need
anybody, I am free of that world.</p><p>Even then you are still not alone because your aloneness still
depends on the world. How could you be alone if there was not a world to
leave? How could you be alone if there was not a society to renounce?
How could you be alone if there was not wife, children, family to leave
behind? Your aloneness depends on them. How could you be poor if there
was no money to be left? Your poverty depends on your riches.</p><p><br></p><p>No, a perfect man, a man who is really a sage, the man of Tao, goes
his way without relying on others. If you rely on others you will
suffer, if you rely on others, you will always be in bondage, you will
become dependent and weak. But that doesn’t mean that you should pride
yourself that you walk alone. Walk alone, but don’t take pride in it.
Then you can move in the world without being a part of it. Then you can
be a husband without being a husband. Then you can possess without being
possessed by your possessions. Then the world is there outside, but not
within. Then you are there, but not corrupted by it.</p><p><br></p><p>This is true loneliness – moving in the world without being touched
by it. But if you are proud, you have missed. If you think, “I have
become somebody,” the boat is not empty, and again you have fallen
victim of the ego.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MAN OF TAO REMAINS UNKNOWN. PERFECT VIRTUE PRODUCES NOTHING.</p><p><br></p><p>NO SELF IS TRUE SELF. AND THE GREATEST MAN IS NOBODY.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen.… The man of Tao remains unknown. Not that nobody will know
him, but it is up to you to discover him. He is not making any effort to
be known. Effort to be known comes from the ego, because ego cannot
exist when you are unknown, it exists only when you are known. It
exists, feeds, when people look at you, when they pay attention to you,
when you are somebody important, significant.</p><p><br></p><p>But how can you be significant if nobody knows you? When the whole
world knows you, then you are significant. That is why people are after
fame so much, and if fame cannot be achieved then they will settle for
being notorious – but not for being unknown! If people cannot praise you
then you will settle for being condemned, but you cannot bear that they
should be indifferent to you.</p><p>I have heard about a politician who once had a great following. Many
people appreciated him – until he became powerful.…</p><p>When you are not in power you look very innocent, because when there
is no power what can you do, how can you hide? So your real nature comes
to be known only when you get power.</p><p>Look at the Gandhians in India before Independence – so saintly. And
now everything has gone to the opposite extreme. Now they are the most
corrupt. What happened? A simple law: when they were not in power they
were like doves, innocent; when power came they became like serpents,
cunning, corrupted, exploiting.</p><p>Your real nature is known only when you have power. When you CAN
harm, then it is known whether you will harm or not.</p><p><br></p><p>Lord Acton said: Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts
absolutely. No, that is not right. Power never corrupts, it only brings
corruption out. How can power corrupt? You were already corrupt but
there was no outlet for it. You were already ugly but you were standing
in darkness. Now you are standing in light, so will you say that light
makes you ugly? No, light only reveals.</p><p><br></p><p>...This politician was very much appreciated and loved, he had a
charismatic personality. Then he came to power and everybody was against
him. He was thrown out, his name became notorious, he was condemned
everywhere, so he had to leave his town because the people would not
allow him to live there, he had done such harm.</p><p><br></p><p>So with his wife he was looking for a new residence in a new town. He
traveled to many towns just to look and feel where to stay. And then in
one town people started throwing stones at him. He said, “This will be
the right place, we should choose this town.”</p><p>The wife said, “Are you mad? Have you gone crazy? The people are
throwing stones.” The politician said, “At least they are not
indifferent.”</p><p>Indifference hurts you most because the ego cannot exist in
indifference. With either for me or</p><p>against me the ego can exist, but don’t be indifferent to me because
then how can I exist, how can</p><p><br></p><p>the ego exist? The man of Tao remains unknown. That means that he is
not seeking people to know him. If they want to know, they should seek
him.</p><p>PERFECT VIRTUE PRODUCES NOTHING.</p><p><br></p><p>This is one of the basics of Taoist life.</p><p><br></p><p>Perfect virtue produces nothing, because when you are perfectly
virtuous nothing is needed. When you are perfectly virtuous there is no
desire, there is no motivation. You are perfect. How can perfection
move? Only imperfection moves. Only imperfection desires to produce
something. So a perfect artist never paints a picture, and a perfect
musician throws away his sitar. A perfect archer breaks his bow and
throws it away, and a perfect man like Buddha is absolutely useless.
What has Buddha produced – poetry, a sculpture, a painting, a society?
He seems to be absolutely unproductive, he has done nothing.</p><p>PERFECT VIRTUE PRODUCES NOTHING, because it needs nothing. Production
comes out of desire, production comes because you are imperfect. You
create something as a substitute because you feel unfulfilled. When you
are absolutely fulfilled, why should you create, how can you create?
Then you yourself have become the glory of creation, then the inner
being itself is so perfect, nothing is needed.</p><p>PERFECT VIRTUE PRODUCES NOTHING. If the world is virtuous, all
utilitarian goals will be lost. If the world is really virtuous there
will be play and no production. Then the whole thing will just become a
game. You enjoy it, but you don’t need it. A perfect sage is absolutely
useless.</p><p><br></p><p>NO SELF IS TRUE SELF.</p><p><br></p><p>When you feel that you are not, for the first time you are, because
the self is nothing but a synonym for the ego. That is why Buddha, Lao
Tzu, Chuang Tzu, they all say there is no self, no ATMAN. Not that there
is not – they say there is no atman, there is no self, because your ego
is so cunning it can hide behind it. You can say, AHAM BRAHMASMI, I am
Brahman...ANA’L HAQ, I am God, and the ego can hide behind it.</p><p>Buddha says there is nobody to claim, there is no self within you.
Buddha says you are like the onion: you peel, you go on peeling the
layers, and finally nothing remains. Your mind is like an onion, go on
peeling. This is what meditation is – go on peeling, go on peeling, and
a moment comes when nothing is left. That nothingness is your true self.
NO SELF IS TRUE SELF. When the boat is empty then only for the first
time you are in the boat.</p><p><br></p><p>AND THE GREATEST MAN IS NOBODY.</p><p>It happened that Buddha renounced the kingdom. Then he went searching
from one forest to another, from one ashram to another, from one master
to another, walking. He had never walked before without shoes but now he
was just a beggar. He was passing along the bank of a river, walking on
the sand, and his footprints were left.</p><p><br></p><p>While resting in the shade of a tree an astrologer saw him. The
astrologer was returning from Kashi, from the seat of learning. He had
become proficient in astrology, had become perfect, and now that</p><p><br></p><p>he had become a great doctor of astrology he was coming back to his
home town to practice. He looked at the footprint on the wet sand and he
became disturbed: These footprints could not belong to an ordinary man
walking on the sand without shoes during such a hot summer, at noontime!
These feet belong to a great emperor, a CHAKRAVARTIN. A chakravartin is
the emperor who rules the whole world. All the symbols were there
showing that this man was a chakravartin, an emperor of the whole world
of the six continents. And why should a chakravartin walk barefoot on
the sand on such a hot summer afternoon? It was impossible!</p><p>The astrologer was carrying his most valuable books. He thought, “If
this is possible I should throw these books in the river and forget
astrology forever, because this is absurd. It is very, very difficult to
find a man who has the feet of a chakravartin. Once in millions of years
a man becomes a chakravartin, and what is this chakravartin doing
here?”</p><p><br></p><p>So he followed the footprints to their source and he looked at Buddha
who was sitting resting under a tree with closed eyes, and he became
more disturbed. This astrologer became absolutely disturbed because the
face was also the face of a chakravartin. But the man looked like a
beggar, with his begging bowl just there by his side, with torn clothes.
But the face looked like that of a chakravartin, so what should he
do?</p><p>He said, “I am very disturbed, put me at ease. There is only one
question I have to ask. I have seen and studied your footprints. They
should belong to a chakravartin, to a great emperor who rules over all
the world, the whole earth is his kingdom – and you are a beggar. So
what should I do? Should I throw away all my astrology books? My twelve
years of effort in Kashi have been wasted and those people there are
fools. I have wasted the most important part of my life, so put me at
ease. Tell me, what should I do?”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “You need not worry. This will not happen again. You
take your books, go to the town, start your practice and don’t bother
about me. I was born to be a chakravartin. These footprints carry my
past.”</p><p><br></p><p>All footprints carry your past – the lines on your hand, your palm,
carry your past. That is why astrology, palmistry, is always true about
the past, never so true about the future, and absolutely untrue about a
buddha, because one who throws off his whole past moves into the unknown
– you cannot predict his future.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “You will not come to such a troublesome man again.
Don’t you worry, this will not happen again, take it as an
exception.”</p><p>But the astrologer said, “A few more questions. I would like to know
who you are: am I really seeing</p><p>a dream? A chakravartin sitting like a beggar? Who are you? Are you
an emperor in disguise?” Buddha said, “No.”</p><p>Then the astrologer asked, “But your face looks so beautiful, so
calm, so filled with inner silence. Who are you? Are you an angel from
paradise?”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “No.”</p><p><br></p><p>The astrologer asked one more question, saying, “It seems impolite to
ask, but you have created the desire and the urge. Are you a human
being? If you are not an emperor, a chakravartin, if you are not a DEVA
from paradise, are you a human being?”</p><p>And Buddha said, “No, I am nobody. I don’t belong to any form, to any
name.”</p><p><br></p><p>The astrologer said, “You have disturbed me even more now. What do
you mean?”</p><p><br></p><p>This is what Buddha meant:</p><p><br></p><p>AND THE GREATEST MAN IS NOBODY.</p><p><br></p><p>You can be somebody, but you cannot be the greatest. There is always
someone greater somewhere in the world. And who is somebody? You are the
measure. You say that this man is great – but who is the measure?
You.</p><p>The spoon is the measure of the ocean. You say, “This man is great.”
You say, and many like you</p><p>say, “This man is great” – and he becomes great because of you!</p><p>No. In this world, whoever is somebody cannot be the greatest,
because the ocean cannot be measured by spoons. And you are all
teaspoons measuring the ocean. No, it is not possible.</p><p><br></p><p>So the really greatest will be nobody amongst you. What does it mean
when Chuang Tzu says, “The greatest will be nobody”? It means: it will
be immeasurable. You cannot measure, you cannot label, you cannot
categorize, you cannot say, “Who is this?” He simply escapes
measurement. He simply goes beyond and beyond and beyond and the
teaspoon falls to the ground.</p><p>Enough for today.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s3>3</span></p><p><br></p><p>The Owl and the Phoenix</p><p><br></p><p>12 July 1974 am in Buddha Hall</p><p><br></p><p>HUI TZU WAS PRIME MINISTER OF LIANG.</p><p><br></p><p>HE HAD WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE INSIDE INFORMATION THAT CHUANG TZU
COVETED HIS POST,</p><p>AND WAS PLOTTING TO SUPPLANT HIM. WHEN CHUANG TZU CAME TO VISIT

AND SAID:</p><p>“HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE BIRD</p><p><br></p><p>THAT LIVES IN THE SOUTH –</p><p><br></p><p>47</p><p><br></p><p>THE PHOENIX THAT NEVER GROWS OLD?</p><p><br></p><p>“THIS UNDYING PHOENIX RISES OUT OF THE SOUTH SEA</p><p>AND FLIES TO THE SEA OF THE NORTH,</p><p><br></p><p>NEVER ALIGHTING EXCEPT ON CERTAIN SACRED TREES.

ambition, then to be religious is impossible, because only a superior
man can become religious. Ambition implies inferiority. Try to
understand this because it is one of the basic laws. Without
under-standing it you can go to temples, you can go to the Himalayas,
you can pray and you can meditate, but everything will be in vain. You
will be simply wasting your life if you have not understood whether the
nature of your mind is ambitious or nonambitious. Your whole search will
be futile, because ambition can never lead to the divine. Only
non-ambition can become the door.</p><p><br></p><p>Modern psychology also agrees with Chuang Tzu, with Lao Tzu, with
Buddha, with all those who have known, that inferiority creates
ambition. Hence politicians come from the worst stuff in humanity. All
politicians are SUDRAS, untouchables. It cannot be otherwise, because
whenever the mind feels the inferiority complex it tries to become
superior – the opposite is born. When you feel ugly, you try to be
beautiful. If you are beautiful, then it is no effort.</p><p><br></p><p>So look at ugly women and you will come to know the nature of the
politician. An ugly woman always tries to hide the ugliness, always
tries to be beautiful. At least the face, the painted face, the
clothes,</p><p><br></p><p>the ornaments, all belong to the ugly. The ugliness has somehow to be
overcome and you have to create the opposite to hide it, to escape from
it. A really beautiful woman will not worry, she will not even be
conscious of her beauty. And only an unconscious beauty is beautiful.
When you become conscious, the ugliness has entered.</p><p>When you feel that you are inferior, when you compare yourself with
others and see that they are superior to you, what will you do? The ego
feels hurt – you are inferior. You just cannot accept it, so you have to
deceive yourself and others.</p><p>How do you deceive? There are two ways. One is to go mad. Then you
can declare that you are Alexander, Hitler, Nixon. Then it comes easily
because then you are not bothered by what others say. Go to the
madhouses all over the world and there you will find all the great
characters of history, still living!</p><p><br></p><p>While Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was alive, at least one dozen people in
India believed that they were Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Once he went to a
madhouse to inaugurate a new department. And the madhouse authorities
had arranged for a few people to be released by him, because now they
had become healthy and normal. The first person was brought to him and
introduced, so Nehru introduced himself to the madman who had become
more normal and said, “I am Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, prime minister of
India.”</p><p><br></p><p>The madman laughed and said, “Don’t worry. Be here for three years
and you will become as normal as I have become. Three years ago when I
first came to this madhouse that is who I believed I was – Pandit
Jawaharlal Nehru, prime minister of India. But they have cured me
completely, so don’t worry.”</p><p><br></p><p>This has happened in many ways. Lloyd George was prime minister of
England. In the war days, at six o’clock in the evening there used to be
a blackout and nobody could leave their homes. All traffic stopped,
lights were not allowed, and everyone had to be in a shelter of some
kind. Lloyd George was taking his usual evening walk, and he forgot.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly the siren went off. It was six o’clock and his house was at
least a mile’s walk away. So he knocked on the nearest door and said to
the man who opened it, “Let me rest here for the night; otherwise the
police will catch me. I am Lloyd George, the prime minister.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man suddenly grabbed him and said, “Come in. This is the right
place for you. We have three Lloyd Georges already!” It was a
madhouse.</p><p>Lloyd George tried to convince the man that he was the real one. But
the man said, “They all argue, so</p><p>don’t bother to try, just come in or I will beat you.”</p><p><br></p><p>So Lloyd George had to keep quiet all night or he really would have
been beaten. How could he convince them? There were already three Lloyd
Georges and they had all tried to prove it.</p><p>One way is to go mad – you suddenly declare that you are superior,
the most superior. Another way is to go politician. Either go mad or go
politician. Through politics you cannot suddenly declare – you have to
prove that you really are the prime minister or the president. So it is
the long way around. Madness is a shortcut to importance; politics is
the long way. But they reach the same goal.</p><p><br></p><p>And if the world is to become a sane, normal world, then two types of
persons have to be cured: madmen and politicians. Both are ill. One has
gone the long route round, one has taken the shortcut. And remember well
that the madman is less harmful than the politician, because he simply
declares his superiority, he doesn’t bother to prove it; the politician
bothers to prove it – and the proof is very costly.</p><p>What was Hitler trying to prove? That he was the most superior, the
suprememost Aryan. It would have been better for the world if he had
gone mad, used the shortcut; then there would have been no second world
war.</p><p><br></p><p>Politicians are more dangerous because they are madmen with proofs.
They are madmen working, reaching, achieving a goal, just to hide the
inferiority in them. Whenever somebody feels inferior, he has to prove
or simply hypnotize himself into believing that he is not inferior. You
cannot be religious if you are mad. Not mad in the way a Saint Francis
is mad – that madness comes through ecstasy, this madness comes through
inferiority. The madness of a Saint Francis or a Chuang Tzu comes out of
superiority, comes out of the heart, comes out of the original source.
This other madness comes out of the ego. The soul is always superior and
the ego is always inferior.</p><p><br></p><p>So an egotist has to become a politician somehow or other – whichever
profession he chooses, through it he will be a politician.</p><p>What do I mean when I say politics? I mean the conflict between egos,
the struggle to survive. When your ego and my ego are in conflict then
we are politicians. When I am not in conflict with anybody’s ego, I am a
religious man. When I don’t try to be superior, I am superior. But this
superiority is not in opposition to inferiority, it is absence of the
feeling of inferiority.</p><p><br></p><p>This distinction has to be remembered. There are two types of
superiority. In one you have just hidden the inferiority, covered it,
you are using a mask – behind the mask the inferiority is there. Your
superiority is just superficial, deep down you remain inferior, and
because you go on feeling it you have to carry this mask of superiority,
of beauty. Because you are aware that you are ugly you have to contrive
to be beautiful, you have to exhibit, you have to show a false face.
This is one type of superiority; it is not real.</p><p><br></p><p>There is another type of superiority, and that superiority is the
absence of inferiority, not the opposite to it. You simply don’t
compare. When you don’t compare, how can you be inferior? Look: if you
are the only one on earth and there is nobody else, will you be
inferior? With whom will you compare yourself? Relative to what? If you
are alone what will you be, inferior or superior? You will be neither.
You cannot be inferior because no one is above you; you cannot declare
yourself superior because there is no one beneath you. You will be
neither superior nor inferior – and I say to you that this is the
superiority of the soul. It never compares. Compare, and the inferiority
arises. Don’t compare, and you simply are – unique.</p><p><br></p><p>A religious man is superior in the sense that the inferiority has
disappeared. A politician is superior in the sense that he has overcome
his inferiority. It is hidden there, it is still inside. He is just
using the garb, the face, the mask of a superior man.</p><p><br></p><p>When you compare, you miss; then you will always be looking at
others. And no two persons are the same, they cannot be. Every
individual is unique and every individual is superior, but this
superiority</p><p><br></p><p>is not comparable. You are superior because you cannot be anything
else. Superiority is just your nature. That tree is superior, that rock
is also superior. The whole of existence is divine, so how can anything
here be inferior? It is God, overflowing in millions of ways. Somewhere
God has become a tree, somewhere God has become a rock, somewhere God
has become a bird, somewhere God has become you. And only God exists, so
there can be no comparison. God is superior, but not to anything –
because only God is, and there cannot be any inferiority.</p><p><br></p><p>A religious man comes to experience his uniqueness, comes to
experience his divineness, and through his experience of divineness
comes to realize the divineness of all. This is nonpolitical because now
there is no ambition, you have nothing to prove, you are already proved;
you have nothing to declare, you are already declared. Your very being
is the proof. You are...it is enough. Nothing else is needed.</p><p>Hence, remember this as the basic law. If in religion also you go on
comparing, you are in politics, not in religion. That is why all
religions have become political. They use religious terminology, but
hidden behind is politics. What is Islam? What is Hinduism? What is
Christian-ity? They are all political groups, political organizations,
doing politics in the name of religion.</p><p><br></p><p>When you go to the temple to pray, do you simply pray or do you
compare? If someone else is praying there, does comparison arise in your
mind? Do you wonder if he is doing better than you, or if you are doing
better than him? Then the temple is there no more. The temple has
disappeared, it has become politics.</p><p>In religion comparison is not possible; you simply pray, and prayer
becomes your inner being. It is not something outward to be compared.
This incomparable prayer, incomparable meditation, will lead you to the
intrinsic superiority of all existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha says: Don’t be ambitious, because through ambition you will
remain inferior always. Be nonambitious and attain to your intrinsic
superiority. It is intrinsic. It doesn’t have to be proved, or achieved,
you already have it, you have got it. It is already there – it has
always been with you and it will always remain with you. Your very being
is sup-erior but you don’t know what being is there. You don’t know who
you are. Hence so much effort in seeking your identity, in searching, in
proving that you are superior to others. You don’t know who you are.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you know, then there is no problem. You are already superior.
And it is not only you that is superior – everything is superior. The
whole of existence is superior without anything being inferior, because
God is one, existence is one. Neither the inferior nor the superior can
exist. The nonambitious mind comes to realize this.</p><p><br></p><p>Now let us take Chuang Tzu’s sentences. This beautiful incident
really happened. Chuang Tzu was on his way to the capital and the prime
minister became afraid. He must have heard the news that Chuang Tzu was
coming through the secret police, the cid. And politicians are always
afraid, because everybody is their enemy, even friends are enemies, and
one has to protect oneself from friends because they too are trying to
pull you down.</p><p>Remember, nobody is a friend. In politics, everybody is an enemy.
Friendship is just a facade. In religion there is no one who is an
enemy. In religion there cannot be any enemy; in politics there cannot
be any friend.</p><p><br></p><p>The prime minister became afraid because Chuang Tzu was coming.
Chuang Tzu’s superiority was such that the prime minister thought that
he might try to become prime minister. It was an uneasy situation. And
of course Chuang Tzu WAS superior; not superior in comparison to anybody
else, he was simply superior. It was intrinsic.</p><p>When a man like Chuang Tzu moves, he is king; whether he is living
like a beggar or not, it makes no difference. He is a king wherever he
moves. Kingship is not something external to him, it is something
internal.</p><p>A begging monk from India went to America at the beginning of this
century; his name was Ramateertha. He used to call himself The Emperor.
The president of America came to see him, and looked astonished. He was
just a beggar! The president asked, “I cannot understand: why do you
call yourself The Emperor? You look like a beggar. You have even written
a book called Six Orders of Emperor Ram. Why?”</p><p><br></p><p>Ramateertha laughed and said, “Look within me, my kingdom belongs to
the inner world. Look in me. I AM an emperor. My kingdom is not of this
world.”</p><p><br></p><p>Because of this, Jesus was crucified. He was always saying, “I am the
king.” He was misunderstood. The man who was the king, Herod, became
alert. The viceroy, Pontius Pilate, thought that Jesus was dangerous,
because he talked about the kingdom and the king, and he had declared,
“I am the king of the Jews.” He was misunderstood. He was talking of a
different type of kingdom which is not of this world.</p><p><br></p><p>When he was being crucified the soldiers poked fun at him, threw
stones and shoes at him, and just to mock him, put a crown of thorns on
his head with the words: king of the Jews. And when they were throwing
stones and shoes at him they were saying, “Now, tell us something about
the kingdom, say something, you king of the Jews!”</p><p><br></p><p>He was talking of some other kingdom, not of this world; that kingdom
is not without, that kingdom is within. But whenever a man like Jesus
walks, he is the emperor. He cannot help it. He is not in competition
with anybody, he is not hankering for any crown of this world, but
wherever he goes ambitious people become afraid, politicians become
afraid. This man is dangerous, because the very face, the eyes, the way
he walks, show that he is an emperor. He need not prove it, he is the
proof. He need not utter it, need not say it.</p><p>So when the prime minister heard through the secret police that
Chuang Tzu was coming, he thought he must be coming to the capital to
supplant him; otherwise, why come? People only came to the capital for
that. One never goes to Delhi for anything else. People come to the
capitals because of ambition, in search of ego, identity. Why should he
come – a fakir, a beggar? What is the need for him to come to the
capital? He must be coming to take my seat, my chair. He must be coming
to the king to say, “I am the right man. Make me prime minister and I
will put every wrong right. I will solve all your problems.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the man had a glory around him, a charisma. The prime minister
became afraid. Prime ministers are always inferior. Deep down the
inferiority complex is there, like a disease, like a worm eating the
heart, always afraid of the superior.</p><p><br></p><p>HUI TZU WAS PRIME MINISTER OF LIANG.</p><p><br></p><p>HE HAD WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE INSIDE INFORMATION THAT CHUANG TZU
COVETED HIS POST,</p><p>AND WAS PLOTTING TO SUPPLANT HIM.</p><p><br></p><p>Politicians cannot think otherwise. The first thing to be understood
is that what you are is what you think of others. Your desires, your own
ambitions give you the pattern. If you are after money you think that
everyone is after money. If you are a thief you keep checking your
pocket: that is how you show that you are a thief. Your inner desire is
the language of your understanding. Politicians always think in terms of
plots, conspiracies: Somebody is going to supplant me, somebody wants to
get rid of me Because that is what they have done, that is what they
have been doing all their lives, plotting.</p><p>Politicians are conspirators. That is their language. And you look at
others through your mind, you project onto others things which are
hidden deep within you. Hui Tzu thought, “This Chuang Tzu is plotting to
supplant me.”</p><p>When Chuang Tzu came to visit him, the prime minister sent out police
to arrest him. But although they searched for three days and nights,
they could not find him. This is beautiful!</p><p>The police can only find thieves – they understand each other. The
mind of the policeman and the mind of a thief are not different –
thieves in the service of the government are the police. Their mind,
their way of thinking is the same, only their masters are different. A
thief is in his own service, a policeman is in the service of the state
– but both are thieves. That is why policemen can catch thieves. If you
send a sadhu to find a thief, he won’t find him, because he will look at
others through his mind.</p><p><br></p><p>A rabbi was walking past a young man during a religious festival. The
young man was smoking, and smoking was forbidden on that day. So the
rabbi stopped and asked him, “Don’t you know, young man, that this is a
religious day, and you should not be smoking?”</p><p><br></p><p>The young man said, “Yes, I know that this is a religious day.” Still
he continued smoking – not only</p><p>that, he blew smoke into the rabbi’s face.</p><p><br></p><p>The rabbi asked, “And don’t you know that smoking is forbidden?”</p><p><br></p><p>The young man said arrogantly, “Yes, I know it is forbidden.” And he
continued.</p><p><br></p><p>The rabbi looked at the sky and said, “Father, this young man is
beautiful. He may be breaking the law, but nobody can force him to lie.
He is a truthful man. He says: Yes, I know this is a religious day, and
yes, I know it is forbidden. Remember on the day of judgment, that this
young man could not be forced to lie.”</p><p>This is a beautiful rabbi. This is the mind of a sadhu. He cannot see
wrong, he always sees right.</p><p><br></p><p>The police could not find Chuang Tzu, it was impossible. They could
have found him if he had been an ambitious man, if he had been plotting,
if he were thinking in terms of politics – then he could</p><p><br></p><p>have been caught. The police must have looked in places where he was
not, and their paths must have crossed many times. But he was a beggar,
a nonambitious man. He was not plotting. He had no mind for plots, he
was like the breeze. The police searched and searched for many days and
couldn’t find him.</p><p>You can find only that which you are. You always find yourself in
others, because others are just mirrors. To catch Chuang Tzu, a Lao Tzu
was needed. Nobody else could catch him, for who could understand him? A
Buddha was needed; Buddha would have guessed where he was. But a
policeman? – impossible! Only if he were a thief would it be possible.
Look at the policeman, the way he is, the way he talks, the dirty
language he uses; it is even more vulgar than thieves’ language. The
policeman has to be more vulgar than the thief, otherwise thieves would
win.</p><p><br></p><p>Once a man was caught by the police and the magistrate asked, “Tell
me, when you were caught, what did the policeman say to you?”</p><p>The man said, “Can I repeat the same vulgar language that he used
here in court? Will you not feel offended? It might shock you.”</p><p><br></p><p>The magistrate said, “Leave out the vulgar language but tell us what
he said.” The man thought and said, “Then...the policeman said
nothing.”</p><p>The police came back to Hui Tzu and reported that they couldn’t find
Chuang Tzu. There was no</p><p>such man.</p><p><br></p><p>They must have had a picture, some way of identifying him, some idea
of how to find him, catch him, his type. But Chuang Tzu has no identity,
he has no face. Moment to moment he is a flow, a liquidity. Moment to
moment he reflects, responds to existence. He has no fixed abode, he is
homeless, faceless. He has no name. He is not a past, he is always a
present, and all photographs belong to the past.</p><p>It is beautiful and meaningful. Although it looks absurd, it is said
that you cannot photograph a man like Buddha. Not that you cannot
photograph him – but the moment the photograph is there, Buddha has
moved. So a photograph is always of the past and never of the present.
You cannot catch Buddha’s present face. The moment you catch it, it has
passed. The moment you understand, it is already gone.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the names of Buddha is Tathagata. This word is really
wonderful; it means, just like the wind he came and he is gone. Thus
came like the wind and thus gone. You cannot photograph a wind, a
breeze. Before you have caught it, it has already gone, it is there no
longer.</p><p>Chuang Tzu could not be found because the police were searching for
his past and he lived in the present. He was a being, not a mind. Mind
can be caught but being cannot be caught. There are no nets. Mind can be
caught very easily, and you are all caught in some way or other. Because
you have a mind, a wife, a husband will catch you; a shop, a treasure, a
post, anything will catch you. There are nets, millions of nets. And you
cannot be free unless you are free of the mind. You will be caught again
and again. If you leave this wife, another woman will catch you
immediately. You</p><p><br></p><p>cannot escape. You can escape this woman, but you cannot escape
women. You can escape this man but where will you go? No sooner have you
left one than another has come into your life. You can leave this town,
but where will you go? Another town will catch you. You can leave this
desire but another will become the bondage. Mind is always in bondage,
it is already caught. When you drop the mind then the police cannot
catch you.</p><p>This Chuang Tzu was without mind. He was a mindless beggar, or an
emperor. It means the same. He could not be caught.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN CHUANG TZU CAME TO VISIT LIANG</p><p><br></p><p>THE PRIME MINISTER SENT THE POLICE OUT TO ARREST HIM, BUT ALTHOUGH
THEY SEARCHED FOR THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS, THEY COULD NOT FIND HIM.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the third or fourth day Chuang Tzu of his own accord
appeared before Hui Tzu and said, “The type of man that I, Chuang Tzu,
am, cannot be caught. He always appears of his own accord. It is his
freedom. You cannot catch him, you can only invite him. It is his
freedom to appear or not.”</p><p>When there is mind, you are always caught. The mind forces you, you
are its prisoner. When there is no-mind you are free: you can appear,
you can disappear of your own accord. It is your own freedom.</p><p>If I am speaking to you it is not because you have asked a question,
it is of my own accord. If I am working with you it is not because of
you, but of my own accord. When there is no-mind there is freedom. Mind
is the basis of all slavery.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu appeared of his own accord and told a beautiful parable.
Listen from the very deepest core of your heart.</p><p>“HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE BIRD</p><p><br></p><p>THAT LIVES IN THE SOUTH –</p><p>THE PHOENIX – a mythical bird –</p><p><br></p><p>THAT NEVER GROWS OLD?”</p><p><br></p><p>A Chinese myth, it is beautiful and carries much meaning. Myth is not
truth, but it is truer than any truth. Myth is a parable, it indicates
something which cannot be indicated otherwise. Only through a par-able,
through poetry, can it be said. Myth is poetry, it is not a description.
It indicates the truth, not an event in the outer world; it belongs to
the inner.</p><p>“HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE BIRD</p><p><br></p><p>THAT LIVES IN THE SOUTH?”</p><p><br></p><p>To China, India is the south, and that bird lives here. It is said
that when Lao Tzu disappeared, he disappeared into the south. They don’t
know when he died...he never died. Such people never die, they simply go
to the south – they disappear into India.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that Bodhidharma came from the south. He left India, and
searched for the disciple to whom he was to transmit the treasure of
Buddha. After nine years waiting, he was able to transmit it and it is
said that then he disappeared again into the south. India is the south
for China. Really, India is the source of all myth; not a single myth
exists in the whole world which has not arisen here.</p><p><br></p><p>Science arose out of the Greek mind, myth out of the Indian mind. And
there are only two ways of looking at the world: one is science, the
other is religion. If you look at the world through science, it is
looking through analysis, mathematics, logic.</p><p><br></p><p>Athens, the Greek mind, gave science to the world, the Socratic
method of analysis, logic and doubt. Religion is a totally different
pattern of looking at the world. It looks at the world through poetry,
through myth, through love. Of course, it is romantic. It cannot give
you facts, it will only give you fictions. But I say fictions are more
factual than any fact, because they give you the innermost core, they
are not concerned with the outer event. Hence, India has no history. It
has only myth, Puranas, no Itihas, no history.</p><p>Rama is not an historical person. He may or may not have been, it
cannot be proved. Krishna is a myth, not an historical fact. Maybe he
was, maybe he was not. But India is not bothered whether Krishna and
Rama are historical. They are meaningful, they are great epic poems. And
history is meaningless for India because history contains only bare
facts, it never reveals the innermost core. We are concerned with the
innermost core, the center of the wheel. The wheel keeps on moving, that
is history, but the center of the wheel, which never moves, is the
myth.</p><p><br></p><p>Said Chuang Tzu:</p><p><br></p><p>“HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE BIRD</p><p><br></p><p>THAT LIVES IN THE SOUTH –</p><p><br></p><p>THE PHOENIX THAT NEVER GROWS OLD?”</p><p><br></p><p>All that is born grows old. History cannot believe in this bird,
because history means the beginning and the end, history means the span
between birth and death. And the span between the birthless and the
deathless is myth.</p><p>Rama is never born and never dies. Krishna is never born and never
dies. They are always there. Myth is not concerned with time, it is
concerned with eternity. History changes with the times, myth is always
relevant. No, myth can never be out of date. Newspaper is history, and
yesterday’s newspaper is already out of date. Rama is not part of the
newspaper, he is not news, and he will never be out of date. He is
always in the present, always meaningful, relevant. History keeps
changing; Rama remains in the center of the wheel, unmoving.</p><p><br></p><p>Says Chuang Tzu:</p><p><br></p><p>“...THAT LIVES IN THE SOUTH –</p><p><br></p><p>THE PHOENIX THAT NEVER GROWS OLD?”</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever seen a picture of Rama or Krishna which belongs to
their old age? They are always young, without even a beard or mustache.
Have you ever seen a picture of Rama bearded? Unless he had some
hormonal defect it must have grown; if he was really a man – and he was
– then the beard must have grown. If Rama was historical, then the beard
would have been there; but we have pictured him beardless, because the
moment the beard grows you have started becoming old. Sooner or later it
will turn white. Death is coming near and we cannot bear to think of
Rama dead, so we have washed his face completely clean of any sign of
death. And this is not only so with Rama; the twenty-four TIRTHANKARAS
of the Jainas are all beardless, no mustaches. Buddha and all the
AVATARS of the Hindus had no beards, no mustaches. It is just to
indicate their eternal youth, the eternity, the timelessness, the
far-awayness.</p><p>“...THE PHOENIX THAT NEVER GROWS OLD.”</p><p><br></p><p>There is time – in time everything changes – and there is eternity.
In eternity nothing changes. History belongs to time, myth belongs to
eternity. Science belongs to time, religion belongs to the nontemporal,
the eternal.</p><p><br></p><p>In you also, both exist – time and eternity. On your surface the
wheel, time: you were born, you will die, but this is only on the
surface. You are young, you will become old. You are healthy, you will
be ill. Now you are full of life, sooner or later everything will ebb,
death will penetrate you. But this is only on the surface, the wheel of
history. Deep down right now in you the eternity exists, the timeless
exists. There nothing grows old – the phoenix, the south, the India, the
eternal. Nothing grows old, nothing changes, everything is unmoving.
That south is within you.</p><p><br></p><p>That is why I keep saying that India is not part of geography, it is
not part of history, it is part of an inner map. It doesn’t exist in
Delhi, it never existed there. Politicians don’t belong to it; it
doesn’t belong to politics. It is the inner. It exists everywhere.</p><p>Wherever a man comes deep down into himself he reaches India. That is
the reason for the eternal attraction, the magnetism, of India. Whenever
a person becomes uneasy with his life, he moves towards India. This is
just symbolic. Through physical movement you will not find India. A
different movement is needed, where you start moving from the outer to
the inner, to the south, to the land of myth, and the deathless, ageless
phoenix – THE PHOENIX THAT NEVER GROWS OLD.</p><p><br></p><p>“THIS UNDYING PHOENIX RISES OUT OF THE SOUTH SEA</p><p><br></p><p>AND FLIES TO THE SEAS OF THE NORTH,</p><p>NEVER ALIGHTING EXCEPT ON CERTAIN SACRED TREES. HE WILL TOUCH NO
FOOD</p><p><br></p><p>BUT THE MOST EXQUISITE RARE FRUIT,</p><p><br></p><p>AND HE DRINKS ONLY FROM THE CLEAREST SPRINGS.”</p><p>This soul, this innermost core of your being, never alighting except
on certain sacred trees, this inner bird, this is your being. It alights
only on certain sacred trees.</p><p><br></p><p>“HE WILL TOUCH NO FOOD</p><p>BUT THE MOST EXQUISITE RARE FRUIT,</p><p><br></p><p>AND HE DRINKS ONLY FROM THE CLEAREST SPRINGS.</p><p><br></p><p>“ONCE AN OWL</p><p><br></p><p>CHEWING AN ALREADY HALF-DECAYED DEAD RAT SAW THE PHOENIX FLY
OVER.</p><p>LOOKING UP HE SCREECHED WITH ALARM AND CLUTCHED THE DEAD RAT TO
HIMSELF IN FEAR AND DISMAY.”</p><p>Chuang Tzu is saying: I am the phoenix, and you are just an owl with
an already dead rat, chewing it. And you are alarmed that I am coming to
supplant you. Your position, your power is nothing to me but a dead rat.
This is no food for me. Ambition is not a way for life, it is only for
those who are already dead. I have looked into ambition, and I have
found it useless.</p><p><br></p><p>Once a woman came wailing and weeping to a rabbi, but the rabbi was
at prayer. So she said to the secretary, “Go in, and even if his prayer
has to be interrupted, interrupt. My husband has left me. I want the
rabbi to pray for my husband to come back.”</p><p><br></p><p>The secretary went in and interrupted the prayer. The rabbi said,
“Tell her, don’t worry, her husband will</p><p>be back soon.”</p><p><br></p><p>The secretary went back to the woman and said, “Don’t worry, don’t be
sad. The rabbi says that your husband will come back soon. Go home and
be at ease.”</p><p><br></p><p>Happy, the woman left, saying, “God will reward your rabbi a million
times over, he is so kind.”</p><p><br></p><p>But once the woman had left, the secretary became sad, and told
someone who was standing there that this was not going to help. Her
husband cannot come back, poor woman, and she left here so happy.</p><p><br></p><p>The bystander said, “But why? Don’t you believe in your rabbi and his
prayer?”</p><p><br></p><p>The secretary said, “Of course I believe in my rabbi and I believe in
his prayer. But he has only seen the woman’s petition, I have seen her
face. Her husband cannot EVER come back.”</p><p>One who has seen the face of ambition, one who has seen the face of
desire, one who has seen the face of lust, will never come back to them.
It is impossible, the face is so ugly.</p><p>Chuang Tzu has seen the face of ambition. That is why he says: Your
power, your position, your prime-ministership, is just a dead rat to me.
Don’t screech, and don’t get dismayed.</p><p><br></p><p>“THIS UNDYING PHOENIX ARISES OUT OF THE SOUTH SEA</p><p><br></p><p>AND FLIES TO THE SEAS OF THE NORTH,</p><p><br></p><p>NEVER ALIGHTING EXCEPT ON CERTAIN SACRED TREES. HE WILL TOUCH NO
FOOD</p><p>BUT THE MOST EXQUISITE RARE FRUIT,</p><p>AND HE DRINKS ONLY FROM THE CLEAREST SPRINGS.</p><p><br></p><p>“ONCE AN OWL</p><p><br></p><p>CHEWING AN ALREADY HALF-DECAYED DEAD RAT SAW THE PHOENIX FLY
OVER.</p><p>LOOKING UP HE SCREECHED WITH ALARM AND CLUTCHED THE DEAD RAT TO
HIMSELF IN FEAR AND DISMAY.</p><p>“PRIME MINISTER,</p><p><br></p><p>WHY ARE YOU SO FRANTIC, CLINGING TO YOUR MINISTRY</p><p>AND SCREECHING AT ME IN DISMAY?”</p><p>This is the fact, but only once you know it...only then can you
understand. Listening to a Buddha, or to a Jesus, or to a Zarathustra,
you have always been told: Drop desiring and bliss will be yours. But
you cannot drop it, you cannot understand how bliss can happen when you
drop desire, because you have tasted only desire. It may be poisonous,
but it has been your only food. You have been drinking from poisoned
sources, and when someone says, “Drop it,” you are afraid that you will
die thirsty. You don’t know that there are pure, clear springs and you
don’t know that there are trees with rare fruit. You look only through
your desire, so you cannot see those fruits and those trees.</p><p><br></p><p>When your eyes are filled with desire they only see the dead rats.
Ramakrishna used to say: There are people who cannot see anything else
than the objects of their lust. This owl can sit at the top of a tall
tree, but he is only looking for dead rats. Whenever a dead rat is seen
on the street the owl becomes excited. He won’t get excited, he won’t
even see if you throw him a beautiful fruit. He will not become aware of
it. The information never reaches him because the desires work as a
screen. All the time, continuously, only that enters you which your
desires allow. Your desires are just like a watchman standing at the
door of your being. They allow in only that which appeals to them.</p><p>Change this watchman; otherwise you will live always on dead rats.
You will remain an owl, and that is the misery, because deep within you
the phoenix is hidden and you are behaving like an owl. That is the
discontent. That is why you can never feel at ease, that is why you can
never feel blissful. How can a phoenix feel blissful with a dead rat? He
is always a stranger, and this is not the right food for him.</p><p><br></p><p>And this you have felt many times. Making love to a woman or to a
man, you have felt many times that this is not for you. The phoenix
asserts itself but the owl is much more noisy. The phoenix cannot be
heard, its voice is very subtle and silent, not aggressive. In moments
of peace and meditation the phoenix says, “What are you doing? This is
not for you. What are you eating? This is not for you. What are you
drinking? This is not for you.”</p><p>But the owl is very noisy and you have believed in the owl for so
long that you go on following it just like a habit. It has become a dead
habit. You simply follow it, because it is the line of least resistance.
The rut is there. You don’t have to do anything. You simply run on the
track, you go on running in a circle – the same desires, the same lusts,
the same ambitions. No wonder you live in anguish, you live in a
nightmare.</p><p><br></p><p>Let the inner Chuang Tzu assert himself, let the inner phoenix assert
itself. Listen to it, it is a still, small voice. You will have to calm
down, you will have to put this owl to sleep; only then will you be able
to listen. This owl is the ego, the mind, the phoenix is the soul. It is
born in the south, out of the sea, it is not a part of the land. Not out
of the mud, out of the vast sea it is born. It never grows old, it never
dies. It alights only on rare, holy, sacred trees, eats only exquisite
rare fruit, drinks only from the clearest of springs. Those springs are
there, those holy trees are there. You have been missing them because of
the owl, and the owl has become the leader.</p><p>All meditation is nothing but an effort to silence this owl so that
the still small voice can be heard. Then you will see what you have been
doing – chewing a dead rat.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu is right. The prime minister was unnecessarily dismayed.
When you, your inner phoenix, comes to live its life, the owl, the prime
minister, will in the beginning be very much dismayed. Your mind will
create every type of objection to meditation because the mind is afraid,
the prime minister is afraid – this Chuang Tzu, this meditativeness, is
coming to supplant him.</p><p>Your mind will catch hold of the dead rat, and will scream, scared,
as if somebody is going to take that food away from it. In the beginning
it will happen – and you have to be alert and aware of it. Only your
awareness will help by and by.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever one starts meditating, the mind becomes rebellious. It
starts up all types of arguments: What are you doing, why are you
wasting time? Use this time! You can achieve so much in the</p><p><br></p><p>time. That desire has been waiting for so long unfulfilled, and now
you are wasting time meditating. Forget it. Those who say that
meditation is possible are deceiving you. These Buddhas, these Chuang
Tzus, don’t believe them. Believe in the mind, mind says. It creates all
kinds of doubts about everybody, but it never creates any doubt about
itself.</p><p>I have heard: A man was talking to his small child. The child had
written a letter as part of his homework and was showing it to his
father. There were as many spelling mistakes in it as there were words,
even more. So the father said, “Your spelling is awful. Why don’t you
look in the dictionary? When you feel in doubt, look in the
dictionary.”</p><p><br></p><p>The child said, “But, Dad, I never feel in doubt.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is what your mind does. It says to Buddha, “But Dad, I never
feel in doubt.”</p><p>Mind never doubts itself, that is the problem. It doubts everybody –
it will doubt even a Buddha. Even if Krishna knocks at your door it will
doubt; if Jesus comes it will doubt. It has always been so, you have
been doing it continuously.</p><p><br></p><p>You doubt me but you never doubt yourself, because once the mind
starts doubting itself it is already going out of existence. Once
self-doubt arises the base is broken, the mind has lost its confidence.
Once you start doubting the mind, sooner or later you will fall into the
abyss of meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Baal Shem, a mystic, was dying. His son, whose name was Hertz, was a
very sleepy, unconscious person. Before he died, Baal Shem told him that
this night would be his last.</p><p>But Hertz said, “Nobody can know when death will come.” He doubted.
Baal Shem was his father, and thousands believed that he was the
messiah, the man who would lead millions to salvation. But the son
doubted, and that night he fell asleep. He was awakened at midnight. His
father was dead. Then he started crying, weeping. He had missed a great
opportunity, and now there would be no possibility of seeing his father
alive again. But he never doubted his mind, he doubted Baal Shem.</p><p>In his dismay and despair, he started crying. He closed his eyes and
for the first time in his life, now that his father was dead, he started
talking to him. His father used to call him many times: “Hertz, come to
me.” And he would say, “Yes, I will come, but first I have other more
important things to do.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is what your mind is saying. I go on calling you: “Come to me.”
You say, “There are other more important things right now. I will come
later on; wait.”</p><p>But death had broken the bridge. So Hertz cried and started talking
to his father, and he said, “What should I do now? I am lost. I am in
darkness. Now how can I drop this mind which has deceived me? I never
doubted it, and I doubted you. Now it makes me very sad.”</p><p><br></p><p>Baal Shem appeared inside Hertz and said, “Look at me. Do the same as
I do.” Hertz saw, as in a dream, a vision, that Baal Shem went to the
top of a hill and dropped himself into the abyss. And he said, “Do the
same.”</p><p><br></p><p>Said Hertz, “I cannot understand.” Really, doubt arose again: What is
this man saying? This will be suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>Baal Shem laughed, and said, “You are still doubting me, not doubting
yourself. Then do this.” In his vision Hertz saw a big mountain, all
aflame, like a volcano, fire all over, rocks splitting, and the whole
mountain breaking into fragments. Said Baal Shem, “Or do this. Let the
mind be thrown into an abyss, let the mind be burnt up completely.”</p><p>And the story goes that Hertz said, “I will think it over.”</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you say, “I will think it over,” you have started doubting.
Doubt thinks, not you. And when there is no doubt, faith acts, not you.
Doubt thinks, faith acts. Through doubt you can become a great
philosopher; through faith you will become a Chuang Tzu, a phoenix which
never grows old, which is undying. Through doubt you can penetrate the
mysteries of time; through faith you will enter the door of
eternity.</p><p>I have heard about two men who were once lost in a forest on a very
dark night. It was a very dangerous forest, full of wild animals, very
dense, with darkness all around. One man was a philosopher and the other
was a mystic – one a man of doubt, the other a man of faith. Suddenly,
there was a storm, a crashing of the clouds, and great lightning.</p><p><br></p><p>The philosopher looked at the sky, the mystic looked at the path. In
that moment of lightning, the path was before him, illuminated. The
philosopher looked at the lightning, and started wondering, “What is
happening?” and missed the path.</p><p><br></p><p>You are lost in a forest denser than that of the story. The night is
more dark. Sometimes a flash of lightning comes. Look at the path.</p><p>A Chuang Tzu is lightning, a Buddha is lightning, I am lightning.
Don’t look at me, look at the path. If you look at me, you have already
missed, because lightning will not continue. It lasts only for a moment,
and the moment is rare when eternity penetrates time; it is just like
lightning.</p><p><br></p><p>If you look at the lightning, if you look at a buddha – and a buddha
is beautiful, the face fascinates, the eyes are magnetic – if you look
at the buddha, you have missed the path.</p><p>Look at the path, forget the buddha. Look at the path. But that look
happens only when there is no doubt, when there is faith; no thinking,
no mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu has not to be thought about. Don’t think about him. Just
let this story penetrate you and forget it. Through this story the path
is illuminated. Look at the path, and do something. Follow the path,
act. Thinking will not lead you, only action, because thinking goes on
in the head. It can never become total; only when you act, it is
total.</p><p><br></p><p>Enough for today.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s3>4</span></p><p><br></p><p>Apologies</p><p><br></p><p>13 July 1974 am in Buddha Hall</p><p><br></p><p>IF A MAN STEPS ON A STRANGER’S FOOT</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE MARKETPLACE,</p><p><br></p><p>HE MAKES A POLITE APOLOGY AND OFFERS AN EXPLANATION: “THIS PLACE IS

PERFECT WISDOM IS UNPLANNED.</p><p>PERFECT LOVE IS WITHOUT DEMONSTRATIONS. PERFECT SINCERITY OFFERS NO
GUARANTEE.</p><p>All that is great, all that is beautiful, all that is true and real,
is always spontaneous. You cannot plan it. The moment you plan it,
everything goes wrong. The moment planning enters, everything becomes
unreal.</p><p><br></p><p>But this has happened to humanity. Your love, your sincerity, your
truth, everything, has gone wrong because you have planned it, be-cause
you have been taught not to be spontaneous. You have been taught to
manipulate yourself, to control, to manage, and not to be a natural
flow. You have become rigid, frozen, dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Life knows no planning. It is itself enough. Do the trees plan how to
grow, how to mature, how to come to flower? They simply grow without
even being conscious of the growth. There is no self- consciousness,
there is no separation.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you start planning you have divided yourself, you have
become two; the one who is controlling and the one who is controlled. A
conflict has arisen, now you will never be at peace. You may succeed in
controlling but there will be no peace; you may not succeed in
controlling, then too there will be no peace. Whether you succeed or
fail, ultimately you will come to realize that you have failed. Your
failure will be a failure, your success will also be a failure.
Whatsoever you do, your life will be miserable.</p><p>This division creates ugliness, you are not one, and beauty belongs
to oneness, beauty belongs to a harmonious whole. All culture, all
civilization, all societies, make you ugly. All morality makes you ugly
because it is based on division, on control.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that once Baal Shem was traveling in a beautiful coach
with three horses. But he was wondering continuously, because for three
days he had been traveling and not even once had any of the horses
neighed. What had happened to the horses? Then suddenly on the fourth
day, a passing peasant shouted at him to relax control of the reins. He
relaxed control and suddenly all the three horses started neighing, they
came alive. For three days continuously they were dead, dying.</p><p><br></p><p>This has happened to you all, to the whole of humanity. You cannot
neigh, and unless a horse neighs, the horse is dead, because neighing
means he is enjoying, there is an overflowing. But you cannot neigh, you
are dead. Your life has not in any way an overflowing song, a dance that
happens when the energy is too much.</p><p><br></p><p>Flowering is always a luxury, it is not a necessity. No tree needs
flowers as a necessity, roots are enough. Flowering is always luxurious.
Flowers come only when the tree has too much, it needs to give, it needs
to share.</p><p>Whenever you have too much, life becomes a dance, a celebration. But
society doesn’t allow you to dance, to celebrate, so society has to see
that you never have more energy than necessary. You are only allowed to
live at starvation level. You are not allowed to be too much, because
once you are too much you cannot be controlled, and society wants to
control you. It is a domination, very subtle.</p><p><br></p><p>Every child is born overflowing. Then we have to cut the energy
source, we have to prune the child from here and there so that he
becomes controllable. And the basis of all control is to divide the
child in two. Then you need not bother, he himself will do the
controlling. Then you need not bother, he himself will be the enemy of
his own self.</p><p><br></p><p>So they tell the child: This is wrong. Don’t do this. Suddenly the
child is divided, now he knows what</p><p>is wrong, now he knows what part of his being is wrong, and his head
becomes the controller.</p><p><br></p><p>Through division intellect has become the controller, the master. If
you are undivided, you will not have any head. Not that the head will
disappear or the head will fall off, but you will not be head- oriented
– your total being will be you.</p><p>Right now you are only the head, the rest of the body is just to
sustain the head. The head has become the exploiter, the dictator. And
this has come through conflict, the creation of conflict in you. You
have been taught that this is good and that is bad. The intellect learns
it and then the intellect keeps on condemning you.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, if you condemn yourself you will condemn everybody – you
will condemn the whole. And a person who condemns himself cannot love. A
person who condemns himself cannot pray. A person who condemns himself,
for him there is no God, there cannot be. A condemning mind can never
enter the divine temple. Only when you dance, only when you are
ecstatic, not condemning, only when you are overflowing with nobody
sitting in control, nobody managing, does life become a let-go; it is
not formal, it is natural. Then you enter, then everywhere is the door.
Then you can reach the temple from anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>But right now, as you are, you are schizophrenic. You are not only
schizophrenic when a psychoanalyst says that you are. There is no need
for any psychoanalyst to analyze you. Society creates schizophrenics;
division is schizophrenia. You are not one. You are born one but
immediately society starts working on you, major surgery is to be done,
you are continuously operated upon to be divided. Then society is at
ease because you are fighting with yourself, your energy is dissipated
in the inner fight, it is never an overflowing. Then you are not
dangerous.</p><p>Overflowing energy becomes rebellion. Overflowing energy is always
rebellious, overflowing energy is always in revolution. It is just like
a river in flood – it doesn’t believe in the banks, in the rules, in the
laws, it simply goes on overflowing towards the sea. It knows only one
goal – how to become the sea, how to become the infinite.</p><p><br></p><p>Overflowing energy is always moving towards God. God is missing in
our world, not because of science, not because of atheists, but because
of the so-called religious. They have divided you so</p><p><br></p><p>much that the river keeps fighting with itself. Nothing is left to
move, no energy is left; you are so tired fighting with yourself, how
can you move towards the sea?</p><p>One of the basic laws of Tao, of Lao Tzu, of Chuang Tzu, is that if
you are spontaneous it is the highest prayer; you cannot miss God,
whatsoever you do you will reach him. So Chuang Tzu never talks about
God; talk is irrelevant, it isn’t needed. He talks only of how to bring
out the wholeness in you. The holy is irrelevant. When you become whole,
you become holy. When your fragments dissolve into one, your life has
become a prayer. They never talk about prayer, it is not needed.</p><p>Spontaneity, living as a whole.… If you want to live as a whole, you
cannot plan. Who will plan? You cannot decide for tomorrow, you can live
only here and now. Who will decide? If you decide, division has entered,
then you will have to manipulate. Who will plan? The future is unknown,
and how can you plan for the unknown? If you plan for the unknown the
planning will come from the past. That means that the dead will control
the living. The past is dead, and the past goes on controlling the
future, hence you are so bored. It is natural, it has to happen. Boredom
comes from the past, because the past is dead and the past is trying to
control the future.</p><p><br></p><p>The future is always an adventure, but you don’t allow it to be an
adventure. You plan it. Once</p><p>planned, your life is running on a track. It is not a river.</p><p><br></p><p>When you run on a track you know where you are going, what is
happening. Everything is just a repetition. Who will plan? If mind
plans, mind is always of the past. Life cannot be planned, because
through planning you are committing suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>Life can only be unplanned, moving moment to moment into the unknown.
But what is your fear? You will be there to respond; whatsoever the
situation you will be there to respond. What is your fear? Why plan
it?</p><p>The fear comes because you are not certain of whether you will be
there or not. You are so unconscious, that is the uncertainty. You are
not alert.</p><p><br></p><p>You are going to have an interview for a job, so you keep planning in
your mind what to answer, how to answer, how to enter the office, how to
stand, how to sit. But why? You will be there, you can respond.</p><p><br></p><p>But you are not certain about yourself, you are so unalert, you are
so unconscious, you don’t know – if you don’t plan, something may go
wrong. If you are alert, then there is no problem. You will be there, so
whatever the situation demands, you will respond.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, this planning is not going to help, because if you
cannot be conscious, cannot be aware in a situation when you are
planning, then that planning is also being done in sleep. But you can
repeat it so many times it becomes mechanical, then when the question is
asked you can answer. The answer is readymade, you are not needed. It is
a fixed pattern, you simply repeat it; you become a mechanical device,
you need not be there at all. The answer can be given, it comes from the
memory; if you have repeated it many times you know you can rely on
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Through planning life becomes more and more unconscious, and the more
unconscious you are, the more you need planning. Before really dying,
you are dead. Alive means responding, sensitive.</p><p><br></p><p>Alive means: whatsoever comes, I will be there to respond, and the
response will come from me, not from the memory. I will not prepare
it.</p><p>See the difference when a Christian missionary or a Christian
minister, a priest, prepares his sermon.</p><p>I once visited a theological college. There they prepare their
ministers, their priests – five years’</p><p>training. So I asked them where Jesus was prepared and trained, who
taught him how to speak.</p><p>Of course these Christian priests are dead, everything about them is
planned. When you say this, a certain gesture is to be made; even the
gesture is not allowed to be spontaneous. When you say that, you have to
have a certain look; even the eyes are not allowed to be spontaneous.
How you have to stand, when you have to shout, and when you have to
whisper, when you have to hammer the table and when not – everything is
planned.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked them where Jesus was trained. He was not a minister at all,
he was not a priest. He never went to any theological college, he was
the son of a carpenter.</p><p>For two thousand years Christian priests have been trained but they
have not produced a single Jesus, and they will never produce one again
because Jesus cannot be produced. You cannot produce Jesus in a factory.
And these are factories, these theological colleges. There you produce
priests, and if these priests are just boring, dead, a burden, it is
obvious that it is going to be so.</p><p>There are two types of religion. One is of the mind – it is dead.
That religion is known as theology. Then there is the other type of
religion, the real, the spontaneous. It is not theological, it is
mystical. And remember, Hindus have one theology, Mohammedans another,
Christ-ians again another, but religion, the mystic religion, is the
same; it cannot be different.</p><p>Buddha and Jesus and Chuang Tzu and Lao Tzu, they are the same
because they are not theologians. They are not talking from the head,
they are simply pouring from their heart. They are not logicians, they
are poets. They are not saying something from the scriptures, they are
not trained for it, they are simply responding to a necessity in you.
Their words are not readymade, their manners not fixed, their behavior
not planned.</p><p><br></p><p>Now we will enter Chuang Tzu’s sutra.</p><p>IF A MAN STEPS ON A STRANGER’S FOOT</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE MARKETPLACE,</p><p><br></p><p>HE MAKES A POLITE APOLOGY AND OFFERS AN EXPLANATION:</p><p>“THIS PLACE IS SO CROWDED.”</p><p><br></p><p>Apology is needed because there is no relationship, the other is a
stranger. Explanation is needed because there is no love. If there is
love then there is no need for an explanation, the other will</p><p><br></p><p>understand. If there is love, there is no need for apology, the other
will understand – love always understands.</p><p>So there is no higher morality than love, there cannot be. Love is
the highest law, but if it is not there then substitutes are needed.
Stepping on a stranger’s foot in the marketplace an apology is needed,
and an explanation also:</p><p><br></p><p>“THIS PLACE IS SO CROWDED.”</p><p>With reference to this, one thing has to be understood. In the West
even a husband will offer an apology, a wife will offer an explanation.
It means that love has disappeared. It means that everybody has become a
stranger, that there is no home, that every place has become a
marketplace. In the East it is impossible to conceive of this, but
Westerners think that Easterners are rude. A husband will never give an
explanation – no need, because we are not strangers and the other can
understand. When the other cannot understand, only then apology is
needed. And if love cannot understand, what good is apology going to
do?</p><p><br></p><p>If the world becomes a home, all apologies will disappear, all
ex-planations will disappear. You give explanations because you are not
certain about the other. Explanation is a trick to avoid conflict,
apology is a device to avoid conflict. But the conflict is there, and
you are afraid of it.</p><p>This is a civilized way to get out of the conflict! You have stepped
on a stranger’s foot, you see the violence in his eyes – he has become
aggressive, he will hit you. Apology is needed, apology will calm his
anger – it is a trick. You need not be authentic in your apology, it is
just a social device, it works as a lubricant. You give an explanation
just to say: I am not responsible, the place is so crowded, it is a
marketplace, nothing can be done, it had to happen. Explanation says: I
am not responsible.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is always responsible, whether the place is crowded or not,
because love is always aware and alert. You cannot shift the
responsibility to the situation, YOU are responsible.</p><p>Look at the phenomenon.… Apology is a device, just like a lubricant,
to avoid conflict; and explanation is shifting the responsibility onto
something else. You don’t say, “I was unconscious, unaware, that is why
I stepped on your foot.” You say, “The place is so crowded!”</p><p><br></p><p>A religious person cannot do this, and if you go on doing this you
will never become religious, because religion means taking all the
responsibility that is there, not avoiding, not escaping. The more
responsible you are, the more awareness will arise out of it; the less
you feel responsible, the more and more unconscious you will become.
Whenever you feel that you are not responsible you will go to sleep. And
this has happened – not only in individual relationships but on all
levels of society.</p><p><br></p><p>Marxism says that society is responsible for everything. If a man is
poor, society is responsible, if a man is a thief, society is
responsible. You are not responsible, no individual is responsible. That
is why communism is anti-religious – not because it denies God, not
because it says there is no soul, but because of this: it shifts the
whole responsibility onto society, you are not responsible.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at the religious attitude which is totally different,
qualitatively different. A religious man thinks himself responsible: If
someone is begging, I am responsible. The beggar may be at the other end
of the earth, I may not know him, I may not come across his path, but if
there is a beggar, I am responsible. If a war goes on anywhere, in
Israel, in Vietnam, anywhere, I am not participating in it in any
visible way, but I am responsible. I am here. I cannot shift the
responsibility onto society. And what do you mean when you say society?
Where is this society? This is one of the greatest evasions. Only
individuals exist – you will never come across society. You will never
be able to pinpoint it: This is society. Everywhere the individual is in
existence, and society is just a word.</p><p>Where is society? Ancient civilizations played a trick. They said:
God is responsible, fate is responsible. Now communism plays the same
game saying that society is responsible. But where is society? God may
be somewhere, society is nowhere; there are only individuals. Religion
says: You are...rather, I am, responsible. No explanation is needed to
avoid this.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember one thing more: whenever you feel that you are
responsible for all the ugliness, for all the mess, anarchy, war,
violence, aggression, suddenly you become alert. Responsibility
penetrates your heart and makes you aware. When you say, “This place is
much too crowded,” you can go on walking sleepily. Really, you step on
the stranger’s foot not because the place is crowded, but because you
are unconscious. You are walking like a somnambulist, a man walking in
his sleep. When you step on his foot, you suddenly become aware, because
now the situation is dangerous. You make the apology, you fall asleep,
and again you say, “The place is crowded!” You resume your walk, then
you start moving again.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard of a simple villager who had come to the city for the
first time. On the platform at the station someone stepped on his foot
and said, “Sorry.” Then he went into a hotel, someone again clashed with
him and said, “Sorry!” Then he went into a theater and someone almost
knocked him down, and he said, “Sorry.”</p><p>Then the villager said, “This is beautiful, we never knew this trick.
Do whatever you want to do to anybody and say sorry!” So he punched a
man who was passing and said, “Sorry!”</p><p>What are you really doing when you say sorry? Your sleep is broken,
you were walking in a dream – you must have been dreaming, imagining,
something was on your mind – and then you stepped on someone. Not that
the place was crowded – you would have stumbled even if no one had been
there, even then you would have stepped on someone.</p><p><br></p><p>It is you, your unconsciousness, your unconscious behavior. A buddha
cannot stumble even if it is a marketplace, because he moves with full
consciousness. Whatsoever he does, he does knowingly. And if he steps on
your foot it means he has stepped knowingly; there must be some reason
for it. It may be just to help you awake, he may have stepped on your
foot just to wake you up, but he will not say that the place is crowded,
he will not give any explanation.</p><p><br></p><p>Explanations are always deceptive. They look logical, but they are
false. You give explanations only when you have to hide something. You
can watch and observe this in your own life. This is not a theory, this
is a simple fact of everybody’s experience – you give explanations only
when you want to hide something.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth needs no explanation. The more you lie, the more explanations
are needed. There are so many scriptures because man has lied so much,
then explanations are needed to hide the lie. You have to give an
explanation, then this explanation will need further explanation, and it
goes on and on. It is an infinite regression. And even with the last
explanation nothing is explained, the basic lie remains a lie – you
cannot convert a lie into a truth just by explaining it. Nothing is
explained by explanations. You may think so, but it is not the case.</p><p><br></p><p>Once it happened that Mulla Nasruddin went on his first air trip, and
he was afraid but he didn’t want anybody to know. It happens to
everybody on their first flight: nobody wants this to be their first. He
wanted to behave nonchalantly so he walked very bravely. That bravery
was an explanation: I always travel by air. Then he sat down in his seat
and he wanted to say something just to put himself at ease, because
whenever you start talking, you become brave; through talk, you feel
less fear.</p><p>So Nasruddin spoke to the passenger next to him. He looked out of the
window and said, “Look, what terrific height! People look like
ants.”</p><p>The other man said, “Sir, we have not taken off yet. Those ARE
ants.”</p><p><br></p><p>Explanations cannot hide anything. Rather, on the contrary, they
reveal. If you can look, if you have eyes, every explanation is
transparent. It would have been better if he had kept quiet. But don’t
try silence as an explanation. As an explanation it is of no use. Your
silence will be revealing, and your words will reveal – it is better not
to be a liar! Then you need not give any explanations. It is better to
be truthful – the easiest thing is to be true and authentic. If you are
afraid, it is better to say, “I am afraid,” and accepting the fact your
fear will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>Acceptance is such a miracle. When you accept that you are afraid and
say, “This is my first trip,” suddenly you will feel a change coming
over you. The basic fear is not fear, the basic fear is the fear of the
fear: I don’t want anyone to know that I am afraid, I don’t want anyone
to know that I am a coward. But everybody is a coward in a new
situation, and in a new situation to be brave is foolish. To be cowardly
only means that the situation is so new that your mind cannot supply any
answers, the past cannot give the answers, so you are trembling. But
this is good! Why try to supply an answer from the mind? Tremble, and
let the answer come from your present consciousness. You are sensitive,
that is all; don’t kill this sensitivity through explanation.</p><p><br></p><p>Next time you try to give an explanation, be aware of what you are
doing. Are you trying to hide something, trying to explain away
something? Nothing like this will be of any help.</p><p>A man who had become newly rich went to a beach, the most expensive,
the most exclusive, and he spent madly just to influence the people
around him. The next day, while swimming, his wife drowned. She was
carried to the shore and a crowd gathered, so he asked, “What are you
doing now?”</p><p><br></p><p>A man said, “We are going to give your wife artificial
respiration.”</p><p><br></p><p>The rich man said, “Artificial respiration? Nothing doing, give her
the real thing. I’ll pay for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever you do, whatsoever you don’t do, whatsoever you say,

close, the other is not a stranger. Then no explanation is needed, the

he accepts it and that is that. The relationship is closer.</p><p><br></p><p>IF A PARENT</p><p><br></p><p>TREADS ON HIS CHILD’S FOOT</p><p><br></p><p>NOTHING IS SAID AT ALL.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need, the relationship is even more intimate, closer.
There is love, and that love will do. No substitute is needed, no
explanation, no apology.</p><p>THE GREATEST POLITENESS IS FREE OF ALL FORMALITY.</p><p>PERFECT CONDUCT IS FREE OF CONCERN. PERFECT WISDOM IS UNPLANNED.</p><p>PERFECT LOVE IS WITHOUT DEMONSTRATIONS. PERFECT SINCERITY OFFERS NO
GUARANTEE.</p><p>But all these perfections need one thing – and that is spontaneous
awareness; otherwise you will always have false coins, you will always
have false faces. You can be sincere, but if you have to make any effort
then that sincerity is just formal.</p><p>You can be loving, but if your love needs effort, if your love is of
that type which Dale Carnegie talks about in How to Win Friends and
Influence People, if that type of love is there, it cannot be real. You
have been manipulating it. Then even friendship is a business.</p><p><br></p><p>Beware of Dale Carnegies; these are dangerous people, they destroy
all that is real and authentic. They show you how to win friends, they
teach you tricks, techniques, they make you efficient, they give you the
knowhow.</p><p>But love has no knowhow, it cannot. Love needs no training, and
friendship is not something which you have to learn. A learned
friendship will not be a friendship, it will just be an exploitation –
you are exploiting the other and deceiving him. You are not true, this
is a business relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>But in America everything has become business, both friendship and
love. Dale Carnegie’s books</p><p>have sold millions of copies, hundreds of editions, next in
popularity only to The Bible.</p><p><br></p><p>Now nobody knows how to be a friend, it has to be learned. Sooner or
later there will be colleges for love, training courses, even by post,
lessons you can learn and apply. And the problem is that if you succeed
then you are lost forever, because the real will never happen to you,
the door is completely closed. Once you become efficient in a certain
thing, the mind resists. The mind says: This is the short cut, and you
know it well, so why choose another path?</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is always for the line of least resistance. That is why clever
people are never able to love. They are so clever they start
manipulating. They will not say what is in their heart, they will say
what will appeal. They will look at the other person and see what he
wants to be said. They will not say their heart, they will just create a
situation in which the other is deceived.</p><p>Husbands deceiving wives, wives deceiving husbands, friends deceiving
friends The whole world</p><p>has become just a crowd of enemies. There are only two types of
enemies: those you have not been able to deceive and those you have been
able to deceive. This is the only difference. Then how can ecstasy be in
your life?</p><p><br></p><p>So this is not a learning process. Authenticity cannot come through
schooling, authenticity comes through awareness – if you are aware, if
you live in a conscious way. Look at the difference: to live consciously
means to live openly, not to hide, not to play games. To be alert means
to be vulnerable, and whatever happens, happens. You accept it, but you
never compromise, you never purchase anything by giving up your
consciousness. Even if it means that you are left totally alone, you
will accept being alone, but you will be consciously alert, aware. Only
with this alertness does real religion start happening.</p><p>I will tell you a story. It happened once, in ancient times, that
there was a king who was also an astrologer. He had a very deep interest
in studying the stars. Suddenly he felt panic in his heart because he
became aware that it was going to be dangerous to eat the coming year’s
harvest. Whoever ate it would go mad. So he called his prime minister,
his adviser and counsellor, and told him that this was certain to
happen. The stars are clear, and because of the combination of cosmic
rays, this year’s harvest would be poisonous. It happens rarely, once in
thousands of years, but it was going to happen this year, and anyone who
ate of this year’s harvest would go mad. So he asked his adviser, “What
should we do?”</p><p><br></p><p>The prime minister said, “It is impossible to provide for everybody
from last year’s harvest, but one thing can be done. You and I can both
live on last year’s harvest. The remainder of last year’s harvest can be
gathered, requisitioned. There is no problem, it will be enough for you
and I.”</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, “This doesn’t appeal to me. If all my devoted people
go mad, women, saints and sages, devoted servants, all my subjects, even
children, it doesn’t appeal to me to be an outsider. It would not be
worth saving myself and you; that won’t do. I would rather be mad with
everybody else. But I have another suggestion. I will mark your head
with the seal of madness and you will mark my head with the seal of
madness.”</p><p>The prime minister asked, “How is this going to help anybody?”</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, “I have heard that it is one of the ancient keys of
wisdom, so let us try it. After everyone has gone mad, after we have
gone mad, whenever I look at your forehead I will remember that I am
mad. And whenever you look at my forehead, remember that you are
mad.”</p><p><br></p><p>The prime minister was still puzzled; he said, “But what will it
do?”</p><p>The king said, “I have heard from wise men that if you can remember
that you are mad, you are mad no more.”</p><p><br></p><p>A madman cannot remember that he is mad. An ignorant man cannot
remember that he is ignorant. A man who is in a dream cannot remember
that he is dreaming. If, in your dream, you become alert and know that
you are dreaming, the dream has stopped, you are fully awake. If you can
understand that you are ignorant, ignorance drops. Ignorant people
always believe that they are wise, and mad people think that they are
the only really sane ones. When someone becomes really wise, he becomes
so by recognizing his ignorance. So the king said, “This we are going to
do.”</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know what happened, the story ends here, but the story is
meaningful.</p><p>Only alertness can help when the whole world is mad, nothing else.
Keeping yourself outside, going to the Himalayas, will not be of much
help. When everyone is mad, you are going to be mad, because you are
part and parcel of everybody; it is a totality, an organic totality.</p><p><br></p><p>How can you separate yourself? How can you go to the Himalayas? Deep
down you still remain part of the whole. Even living in the Himalayas
you will remember your friends. They will knock in your dreams, you will
think of them, you will wonder what they are thinking of you – you go on
being linked.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot go outside the world. There is nowhere outside the world,
the world is one continent. Nobody can be an island – islands are joined
deep down with the continent. You can just think superficially that you
are separate, but nobody can be separate.</p><p><br></p><p>The king was really wise. He said, “It is not going to help. I am not
going to be an outsider, I will be an insider, and this is what I will
do. I will try to remember that I am mad, because when you forget that
you are mad, then you are really mad. This is what is to be done.”</p><p>Wherever you are, remember yourself, that you are; this consciousness
that you are should become a continuity. Not your name, your caste, your
nationality, those are futile things, absolutely useless. Just remember
that: I am. This must not be forgotten. This is what Hindus call
self-remembrance, what the Buddha called right-mindfulness, what
Gurdjieff used to call self-remembering, what Krishnamurti calls
awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the most substantial part of meditation, to remember that: I
am. Walking, sitting, eating, talking, remember that: I am. Never forget
this. It will be difficult, very arduous. In the beginning you will keep
forgetting; there will be only single moments when you will feel
illuminated, then it is lost. But don’t get miserable; even single
moments are much. Go on, whenever you can remember again, again catch
hold of the thread. When you forget, don’t worry – remember again, again
catch hold of the thread, and by and by the gaps will lessen, the
intervals will start dropping, a continuity will arise.</p><p><br></p><p>And whenever your consciousness becomes continuous, you need not use
the mind. Then there is no planning, then you act out of your
consciousness, not out of your mind. Then there is no need for any
apology, no need to give any explanation. Then you are whatsoever you
are, there is nothing to hide. Whatsoever you are, you are. You cannot
do anything else. You can only be in a state of continuous remembrance.
Through this remembrance, this mindfulness, comes the authentic
religion, comes the authentic morality.</p><p>THE GREATEST POLITENESS IS FREE OF ALL FORMALITY.</p><p>If you are not formal, then nobody is a stranger. Whether you move in
the marketplace or in a crowded street, nobody is a stranger, everybody
is a friend. Not only a friend, really, everybody is just an extension
of you. Then formality is not needed. If I step on my own foot – which
is difficult – I will not say sorry, and I will not say to myself, “The
place is very crowded!” When I step on your foot, I am stepping on my
foot.</p><p><br></p><p>A mind which is fully alert knows that consciousness is one, life is
one, being is one, existence is one, it is not fragmented. The tree
flowering there is me in a different form, the rock lying there on the
ground is me in a different form. The whole of existence becomes an
organic unity – organic, life flowing through it, not mechanical. A
mechanical unity is a different thing – it is dead.</p><p><br></p><p>A car is a mechanical unity, there is no life in it, and that is why
you can replace one part by another. Every part is replaceable. But can
you replace a man? Impossible. When a man dies, a unique phenomenon
disappears; disappears completely, you cannot replace it. When your wife
or your husband dies, now how can you replace them? You may get another
wife, but this will be another wife, not a replacement. And the shadow
of the first will always be there; the first cannot be forgotten, it
will always be there. It may become a shadow, but even shadows of love
are very substantial.</p><p>You cannot replace a person, there is no way. If it is a mechanical
unity then wives are replaceable parts, you can even have spare wives.
You can keep them in your storeroom and whenever your wife dies, you
replace her!</p><p><br></p><p>This is what is happening in the West. They have started to think in
terms of mechanism. So now they say nothing is a problem – if one wife
dies you get another, if one husband is no more you get another So
marriage in the West is a mechanical unity, which is why divorce is
possible. The East</p><p>denies divorce because marriage is an organic unity. How can you
replace a live person? It will never happen again, that person has
simply disappeared into the ultimate mystery.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is an organic unity. You cannot replace a plant because every
plant is unique, you cannot find another, the same cannot be found. Life
has a quality of uniqueness. Even a small rock is unique – you can go
all over the world to find a similar rock and you will not be able to.
How can you replace it? This is the difference between organic unity and
mechanical unity. Mechanical unity depends on the parts; the parts are
replaceable, they are not unique. Organic unity depends on the whole,
not on the parts. Parts are not really parts, they are not separate from
the whole – they are one, they cannot be replaced.</p><p>When you become alert to the inner flame of your inner being,
suddenly you become alert that you are not an island, it is a vast
continent, an infinite continent. There are no boundaries separating you
from it. All boundaries are false, make-believe. All boundaries are in
the mind; in existence there are no boundaries.</p><p><br></p><p>Then who can be a stranger? When you step on somebody, it is you; you
have stepped on your own foot. No apology is needed, no explanation is
needed. There is no one else, there is only one. Then your life becomes
real, authentic, spontaneous; then it is not formal, then you do not
follow any rules. You have come to know the ultimate law. Now no rules
are needed. You have become the law – there is no need to remember the
rules now.</p><p>THE GREATEST POLITENESS IS FREE OF ALL FORMALITY.</p><p>Have you looked at people who are polite? You will not find more
egoistic people than them. Look at a polite person, the very way he
stands, the way he talks, the way he looks, walks; he has managed to
make everything look polite, but inside the ego is manipulating.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at the so-called humble people. They say they are nobodies, but
when they say it, look into their eyes, at the ego asserting. This is a
very cunning ego, because if you say, “I am somebody,” everybody will be
against you, and everybody will try to put you in your place. If you
say, “I am nobody,” everybody is for you, nobody is against you.</p><p><br></p><p>Polite people are very cunning, clever. They know what to say, what
to do, so that they can exploit you. If they say, “I am somebody,”
everybody is against them. Then conflict arises because everybody thinks
that he is an egoist. It will be difficult then to exploit people
because everybody is closed against you. If you say, “I am nobody, I am
just dust on your feet,” then the doors are open and you can exploit.
All etiquette, culture, is a type of sophisticated cunningness, and you
are exploiting.</p><p><br></p><p>THE GREATEST POLITENESS IS FREE OF ALL FORMALITY.</p><p>It happened that Confucius came to see Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu’s master.
And Confucius was the image of formal politeness. He was the greatest
formalist in the world, the world has never known such a great
formalist. He was simply manners, formality, culture and etiquette. He
came to see Lao Tzu, the polar opposite.</p><p><br></p><p>Confucius was very old, Lao Tzu was not so old. The formality was
that when Confucius came in, Lao Tzu should stand up to receive him. But
he remained sitting. It was impossible for Confucius to believe that
such a great master, known all over the country for his humbleness,
should be so impolite. He had to mention it.</p><p>Immediately he said, “This is not good. I am older than you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu laughed loudly and said, “Nobody is older than me. I existed
before everything came into existence. Confucius, we are of the same
age, everything is of the same age. From eternity we have been in
existence, so don’t carry this burden of old age, sit down.”</p><p>Confucius had come to ask some questions. He said, “How should a
religious man behave?”</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu said, “When the how comes, there is no religion. How is not a
question for a religious man. The how shows that you are not religious
but that you want to behave like a religious man – that is why you ask
how.</p><p><br></p><p>“Does a lover ask how one should love? He loves! Really, it is only
later on that one becomes aware that he has been in love. It may be that
only when love has gone does he become aware that he has been in love.
He simply loves. It happens. It is a happening, not a doing.”</p><p>Whatsoever Confucius asked, Lao Tzu replied in such a way that
Confucius became very much</p><p>disturbed: “This man is dangerous!”</p><p>When he returned, his disciples asked, “What happened, what manner of
man is this Lao Tzu?” Confucius said, “Don’t go near him. You may have
seen dangerous snakes, but nothing can compare</p><p>with this man. You may have heard about ferocious lions, they are
nothing before this man. This man is like a dragon which walks on the
earth, can swim in the sea, can go to the very end of the sky – very
dangerous. He is not for us little people, we are too small. He is
dangerous, vast like an abyss. Don’t go near him, otherwise you will
feel dizzy and you may fall. Even I felt dizzy. And I couldn’t
understand what he said, he is beyond understanding.”</p><p>Lao Tzu is bound to be beyond understanding if you try to understand
him through formality; otherwise he is simple. But for Confucius he is
difficult, almost impossible to understand, because he sees through
forms and Lao Tzu has no form and no formality. Nameless, without any
form, he lives in the infinite.</p><p><br></p><p>THE GREATEST POLITENESS IS FREE OF ALL FORMALITY.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu is sitting, Confucius is waiting for him to stand up. Who was
really polite? Confucius waiting for Lao Tzu to stand up and welcome him
and receive him because he is older, is just egotistical. Now the ego
has taken the form of age, seniority.</p><p><br></p><p>But Confucius could not look directly into the eyes of Lao Tzu,
because Lao Tzu was right. He was saying: We are of the same age.
Really, we are the same. The same life flows in you that flows in</p><p><br></p><p>me. You are not superior to me, I am not superior to you. There is no
question of superiority and inferiority, and there is no question of
seniority and juniority. There is no question, we are one.</p><p>If Confucius could have looked into the eyes of Lao Tzu he would have
seen that those eyes were divine. But a man whose own eyes are filled
with laws, rules, regulations, formalities, is almost blind, he cannot
see.</p><p><br></p><p>PERFECT CONDUCT IS FREE OF CONCERN.</p><p>You conduct yourself well because you are concerned. You behave well
because you are concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day a man came to me. He said, “I would like to take
the jump, I would like to become a sannyasin, but I have my family, my
children are studying at college and I have a great responsibility to
them.”</p><p><br></p><p>He is concerned. He has a duty to fulfill, but no love. Duty is
concern; it thinks in terms of something that has to be done because it
is expected, because “What will people say if I leave?” Who thinks about
what people will say? The ego. So: “What will people say? First let me
fulfill my duties.”</p><p>I never tell anybody to leave, I never tell anybody to renounce, but
I insist that one should not be in some relationship because of duty –
because then the whole relationship is ugly. One should be in a
relationship because of love. Then this man would not say, “I have a
duty to fulfill.” He would say, “I cannot come right now. My children
are growing, and I love them, and I am happy working for them.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then this will be a happiness. Now it is not a happiness, it is a
burden. When you carry a burden, when you even turn your love into a
burden, you cannot be happy. And if you have turned your love into a
burden, your prayer will also become a burden, your meditation will also
become a burden. Then you will say, “Because of this guru, this master,
I am caught, and now I have to do this.” It will not come out of you,
your totality; it will not be overflowing.</p><p>Why be worried? If there is love, wherever you are, there is no
burden. And if you love your children, even if you leave them, they will
understand. And if you don’t love your children, and you go on serving
them, they will understand, and they will know that these are just false
things.</p><p><br></p><p>This is happening. People come to see me and they say, “I have worked
my whole life and nobody even feels thankful towards me.” How can
anybody feel thankful towards you? You were carrying them like a burden.
Even small children understand well when love is there, and they
understand well when you are just doing your duty. Duty is ugly, duty is
violent; it shows your concern but doesn’t show your spontaneity.</p><p>Says Chuang Tzu:</p><p><br></p><p>PERFECT CONDUCT IS FREE OF CONCERN.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever is done, is done out of love – then you are not honest
because honesty pays, you are honest because honesty is lovely.</p><p><br></p><p>Businessmen are honest if honesty pays. They say: Honesty is the best
policy. How can you destroy a beautiful thing like honesty and turn it
into a best policy? Policy is politics, honesty is religion.</p><p>An old man was on his deathbed. He called his son and said, “Now I
must tell you the secret, now I am dying. Always remember two things –
this is how I succeeded. First, whenever you give a promise, fulfill it.
Whatsoever the cost, be honest and fulfill it. This has been my basis,
this is why I succeeded. And the second thing, never make any
promises.”</p><p><br></p><p>For a businessman even religion is a policy, for a politician even
religion is a policy – everything is a policy, even love is a policy.
Kings, queens, never marry ordinary, common people. Why? It is part of
politics. Kings marry other princesses, queens, and the concern is about
which relationship will be the most profitable for the kingdom. Two
kingdoms will become related so that they will become friends and will
not be antagonistic. So with whom should the marriage be made?</p><p>In India, in the olden days, a king would marry many women, hundreds,
even thousands. It was part of politics: he would marry the daughter of
anyone who had some power, so that he could create a network of power
relationships. Thus the person whose daughter you have married will
become your friend, he will help you.</p><p><br></p><p>In Buddha’s time India had two thousand kingdoms, so the most
successful king was the one who had two thousand wives, one wife from
every kingdom. Then he could live in peace because now he had no
enemies. Now the whole country became like a family. But how can love
exist in such a concern? Love never thinks of consequences, never
hankers for results. It is sufficient unto itself.</p><p><br></p><p>PERFECT CONDUCT IS FREE OF CONCERN. PERFECT WISDOM IS UNPLANNED.</p><p>A wise man lives moment to moment, never planning. Only ignorant
people plan, and when ignorant people plan, what can they plan? They
plan out of their ignorance. Unplanned they would have been better,
because out of ignorance only ignorance arises; out of confusion, only
greater confusion is born.</p><p>A wise man lives moment to moment, he has no planning. His life is
just free like a cloud floating in the sky, not going to some goal, not
determined. He has no map for the future, he lives without a map, he
moves without a map; because the real thing is not the goal, the real
thing is the beauty of the movement. The real thing is not reaching, the
real thing is the journey. Remember, the real thing is the journey, the
very traveling. It is so beautiful, why bother about the goal? And if
you are too bothered about the goal, you will miss the journey, and the
journey is life – the goal can only be death.</p><p>The journey is life and it is an infinite journey. You have been on
the move from the very beginning – if there was any beginning. Those who
know say there was no beginning, so from no beginning you have been on
the move, to the no end you will be on the move – and if you are
goal-oriented, you will miss. The whole is the journey, the path, the
endless path, never beginning, never ending. There is really no goal –
goal is created by the cunning mind. Where is this whole existence
moving? Where? It is not going anywhere. It is simply going, and the
going is so beautiful, that is why existence is</p><p><br></p><p>unburdened. There is no plan, no goal, no purpose. It is not a
business, it is a play, a LEELA. Every moment is the goal.</p><p>PERFECT WISDOM IS UNPLANNED.</p><p><br></p><p>PERFECT LOVE IS WITHOUT DEMONSTRATIONS.</p><p><br></p><p>Demonstration is needed because love is not there. And the less love
there is, the more you demonstrate – when it is there, you don’t
demonstrate. Whenever a husband comes home with a present for his wife
she will know that something is wrong. He must have stepped out of line,
he must have met another woman. Now this is the explanation, this is a
substitute; otherwise love is such a present that no other present is
needed. Not that love will not give presents, but love itself is such a
present. What else can you give? What else is possible?</p><p>But whenever the husband feels that something is wrong, he has to put
it right. Everything has to be rearranged, balanced. And this is the
problem – women are so intuitive that they know immediately, your
present cannot deceive them. It is impossible, because women still live
with their intuition, with their illogical mind. They immediately jump.
And they will understand that something has gone wrong, otherwise why
this present?</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you demonstrate, you demonstrate your inner poverty. If your
sannyas becomes a demonstration you are not a sannyasin. If your
meditation becomes a demonstration you are not meditative, because
whenever the real exists, it is such a light that there is no need to
demonstrate it. When your house is lighted, when there is a flame, you
need not go to the neighbors and tell them, “Look, our house has got a
lamp.” It is there. But when your house is in darkness you try to
convince your neighbors that light is there. Convincing them, you try to
convince yourself. This is the reason why you want to demonstrate. If
the other is convinced, his conviction, her conviction, will help you to
be convinced.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that once Mulla Nasruddin had a beautiful house, but he
got bored, as everybody gets bored. Whether it was beautiful or not made
no difference; living in the same house every day, he got bored. The
house was beautiful, with a big garden, acres of green land, swimming
pool, everything. But he got bored, so he called a real estate agent and
told him, “I want to sell it. I am fed up, this house has become a
hell.”</p><p>The next day an advertisement appeared in the morning papers; the
real estate agent had inserted a beautiful advertisement. Mulla
Nasruddin read it again and again and he was so convinced that he phoned
the agent: “Wait, I don’t want to sell it. Your advertisement has
convinced me so deeply that now I know that for my whole life I have
been wanting this house, looking for this very house.”</p><p><br></p><p>When you can convince others of your love, you yourself become
convinced. But if you have love, there is no need, you know!</p><p>When you have wisdom, there is no need to demonstrate it. But when
you have only knowledge, you demonstrate, you convince others, and when
they are convinced, you are convinced that you are a man of knowledge.
When you have wisdom, there is no need. Even if not one person is
convinced, you are still certain that you alone are enough proof.</p><p><br></p><p>PERFECT SINCERITY OFFERS NO GUARANTEE.</p><p><br></p><p>All guarantees are because of insincerity. You guarantee, you
promise, you say: This is the guarantee, I will do this. While you are
giving the guarantee, at that very moment the insincerity is there.</p><p><br></p><p>Perfect sincerity offers no guarantee because perfect sincerity is so
aware, aware of many things. First, the future is unknown. How can you
make a guarantee? Life changes every moment, how can you promise? All
guarantee, all promising, can be only for this moment, not for the next.
For the next moment nothing can be done. You will have to wait.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are really sincere and love a woman you cannot say, “I will
love you for my whole life.” If you say this, you are a liar. This
guarantee is false. But if you love, this moment is enough. The woman
will not ask for your whole life. This moment, if love is there, it is
so fulfilling that one moment is enough for many lives. A single moment
of love is eternity; she will not ask. But now she is asking because
this moment there is no love. So she asks, “What is the guarantee? Will
you love me always?”</p><p>This moment there is no love and she is asking for a guarantee. This
moment there is no love and you guarantee for the future – because only
through that guarantee can you deceive at this moment. You can create a
beautiful picture of the future and you can hide the ugly picture of the
present. You say, “Yes, I will love you forever and forever. Even death
will not part us.” What nonsense! What insincerity! How can you do
this?</p><p><br></p><p>You can do this and you do it so easily because you are not aware of
what you are saying. The next moment is unknown; where it will lead, no
one knows, what will happen, no one knows, no one can know it.</p><p>Unknowability is part of the future game. How can you guarantee? At
the most you can say, “I love you this moment and this moment I feel –
this is a feeling of this moment – that even death cannot part us. But
this is a feeling of this moment. This is not a guarantee. This moment I
feel like saying that I will always and always love you, but this is a
feeling of this moment, this is no guarantee. What will happen in the
future nobody knows. We never knew about this moment so how can we know
about other moments? We will have to wait. We will have to be prayerful
that it happens, that I love you for ever and ever, but this is not a
guarantee.”</p><p><br></p><p>Perfect sincerity cannot give any guarantee. Perfect sincerity is so
sincere that it cannot promise: it gives whatsoever it can give here and
now. Perfect sincerity lives in the present, it has no idea of the
future.</p><p>Mind moves in the future, being lives here and now. And perfect
sincerity belongs to the being, not to the mind. Love, truth,
meditation, sincerity, simplicity, innocence, all belong to the being.
The opposites belong to the mind and to hide the opposites the mind
creates false coins: false sincerity, which guarantees, promises; false
love, which is just a name for duty; false beauty, which is just a face
for inner ugliness. Mind creates false coins, and nobody is deceived,
remember, except yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Enough for today.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s3>5</span></p><p><br></p><p>Three in the Morning</p><p><br></p><p>14 July 1974 am in Buddha Hall</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT IS THIS THREE IN THE MORNING? IT IS ABOUT A MONKEY TRAINER</p><p>WHO WENT TO HIS MONKEYS AND TOLD THEM:</p><p><br></p><p>“AS REGARDS YOUR CHESTNUTS,</p><p><br></p><p>YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THREE MEASURES IN THE MORNING,</p><p><br></p><p>AND FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON.”</p><p><br></p><p>ON HEARING THIS ALL THE MONKEYS BECAME ANGRY. SO THE KEEPER SAID:</p><p>“ALL RIGHT THEN,</p><p><br></p><p>I WILL CHANGE IT</p><p><br></p><p>TO FOUR MEASURES IN THE MORNING,</p><p><br></p><p>AND THREE IN THE AFTERNOON.”</p><p><br></p><p>THE ANIMALS WERE SATISFIED WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>THE TWO ARRANGEMENTS WERE THE SAME –</p><p>THE NUMBER OF CHESTNUTS DID NOT CHANGE,</p><p><br></p><p>BUT IN ONE CASE THE MONKEYS WERE DISPLEASED, AND IN THE OTHER CASE
THEY WERE SATISFIED. THE KEEPER WAS WILLING</p><p>TO CHANGE HIS PERSONAL ARRANGEMENT IN ORDER TO MEET OBJECTIVE
CONDITIONS. HE LOST NOTHING BY IT.</p><p>THE TRULY WISE MAN,</p><p><br></p><p>CONSIDERING BOTH SIDES OF THE QUESTION WITHOUT PARTIALITY,</p><p>SEES THEM BOTH IN THE LIGHT OF TAO.</p><p>THIS IS CALLED FOLLOWING TWO COURSES AT ONCE.</p><p><br></p><p>The law of the three in the morning. Chuang Tzu loved this story very
much. He often repeated it. It is beautiful, with many layers of
meaning. Obviously very simple but still very deeply indicative of the
human mind.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing to be understood is that the human mind is monkeyish.
It was not Darwin who discovered that man comes from monkeys. It has
been a long-standing observation that the human mind behaves in the same
patterns as the mind of the monkey. Only rarely does it happen that you
transcend your monkeyishness. When mind becomes still, when mind becomes
silent, when there is really no mind at all, you transcend the monkeyish
pattern.</p><p>What is the monkeyish pattern? For one thing, the mind is never
still. And unless you are still, you cannot see the truth. You are
wavering, trembling so much that nothing can be seen. Clear perception
is impossible. While meditating what are you doing? You are putting the
monkey in a position of stillness, hence all the difficulties of
meditation. The more you try to make the mind still, the more it
revolts, the more it starts getting into turmoil, the more restless it
becomes.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever seen a monkey sitting silently and still? Impossible!
The monkey is always eating something, doing something, swinging,
chattering. This is what you are doing. Man has invented many things. If
there is nothing to do he will chew gum; if there is nothing to do he
will smoke! These</p><p><br></p><p>are just foolish occupations, monkeyish occupations. Something has to
be done continuously so that you remain occupied.</p><p>You are so restless that your restlessness needs to be busy somehow
or other. That is why, whatsoever is said against smoking, it cannot be
stopped. Only in a meditative world can smoking stop – otherwise not.
Even if there is danger of death, of cancer, of tuberculosis, it cannot
be stopped, because it is not a question of just smoking, it is a
question of how to release the restlessness.</p><p>People who chant mantras can stop smoking because they have found a
substitute. You can keep chanting Ram, Ram, Ram, and this becomes a sort
of smoking. Your lips are working, your mouth is moving, your
restlessness is being released. So JAPA can become a sort of smoking, a
better sort, with less harm to the health.</p><p><br></p><p>But basically it is the same thing – your mind cannot be left at
rest. Your mind has to do something, not only while you are awake but
even when you are asleep. One day watch your wife or your husband
sleeping, just sit for two or three hours silently and watch the face.
You will see the monkey not the man. Even in sleep much goes on. The
person is occupied. This sleep cannot be deep, it cannot be really
relaxing, because work is going on. The day is continued, there is no
discontinuity; the mind keeps functioning in the same way. There is
constant inner chatter, an inner monologue, and it is no wonder you get
bored. You are boring yourself. Everybody looks bored.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin was telling a story to his disciples, and suddenly
the rain started – it must have been a day like this. So a passer-by,
just to protect himself, came under the shelter of the shed where
Nasruddin was talking to his disciples. He was just waiting for the rain
to stop but he couldn’t help listening.</p><p>Nasruddin was telling tall stories. Many times the man found it
almost impossible to resist interrupting, because he was saying such
absurd things. But he thought again and again and said to himself, “It
is none of my business. I am only here because of the rain, as soon as
it stops I will go. I need not interfere.” But at a point the man
couldn’t help it, he couldn’t contain himself any longer. He interrupted
saying, “Enough is enough. Excuse me, this is none of my business, but
now you have overdone it!”</p><p><br></p><p>I must first tell you the story and the point where the man could not
contain himself.…</p><p>Nasruddin was saying, “Once in my young days I was traveling in the
forests of Africa, the dark continent. Suddenly one day a lion jumped
out just fifteen feet away from me. I was without any arms or
protection, alone in the forest. The lion stared at me and started
walking towards me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The disciples became very excited. Nasruddin stopped for a moment and
looked at their faces. One</p><p>disciple said, “Don’t keep us waiting, what happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin said, “The lion came nearer and nearer until it was just
five feet away.” Another disciple said, “No more waiting. Tell us what
happened.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin said, “It is so simple, so logical, work it out for
yourself. The lion jumped, killed me and ate me!”</p><p>At this point it was too much for the stranger! He said, “Are you
saying that the lion killed and ate you, and you are sitting here
alive?”</p><p>Nasruddin looked straight at the man and said, “Ha ha, do you call
this being alive?”</p><p><br></p><p>Look at people’s faces and you will understand what he meant. Do you
call this being alive? So bored to death, dragging?</p><p>Once a man said to Nasruddin,“I am very poor. Survival is impossible
now, should we commit suicide? I have six children and a wife, my
widowed sister and old father and mother. And it is getting more and
more difficult. Can you suggest something?”</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin said, “You can do two things and both will be helpful. One,
start baking bread, because people have to live and they have to eat,
you will always have business.”</p><p>The man asked, “And the other?”</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin said, “Start making shrouds for the dead, because when
people are alive, they will die. And this is also a good business. These
two businesses are good – bread, and shrouds for the dead.”</p><p><br></p><p>After a month the man came back. He looked even more desperate, very
sad, and he said, “Nothing seems to work. I have put everything I have
got into the business, as you suggested, but everything seems to be
against me.”</p><p>Nasruddin said, “How can that happen? People have to eat bread while
they are alive, and when</p><p>they die their relatives have to buy shrouds.”</p><p>The man said, “But you don’t understand. In this village no one is
alive and no one ever dies. They are simply dragging along.”</p><p><br></p><p>People are just dragging. You don’t need to look at others’ faces,
just look in the mirror and you will find out what dragging means –
neither alive nor dead. Life is so beautiful, death is also beautiful –
dragging is ugly.</p><p>But why do you look so burdened? The constant chattering of the mind
dissipates energy. Constant chattering of the mind is a constant leakage
in your being. Energy is dissipated. You never have enough energy to
make you feel alive, young, fresh, and if you are not young and fresh
and alive your death is also going to be a very dull affair.</p><p><br></p><p>One who lives intensely, dies intensely, and when death is intense,
it has a beauty of its own. One who lives totally, dies totally, and
wherever totality is there is beauty. Death is ugly, not because of
death but because you have never lived rightly. If you have never been
alive, you have not earned a beautiful death. It has to be earned. One
has to live in such a way, so total and so whole, that he</p><p><br></p><p>can die totally, not in fragments. You live in fragments, so you die
in fragments. One part dies, then another, then another, and you take
many years to die. Then the whole thing becomes ugly. Death would be
beautiful if people were alive. This inner monkey doesn’t allow you to
be alive, and this inner monkey will not allow you to die beautifully
either. This constant chattering has to be stopped.</p><p>And what is the chattering, what is the subject matter? The subject
matter is the three in the morning that goes on in the mind. What are
you doing inside the mind? Continuously making arrangements: to do this,
not to do that, to build this house, to destroy that house; to move from
this business to another because there will be more profit; to change
this wife, this husband. What are you doing? Just changing
arrangements.</p><p>Chuang Tzu says that finally, ultimately, if you can look at the
total, the total is always the same. It is seven. Whether you are given
three measures of chestnuts in the morning and four measures in the
evening, or the other way around – four measures in the morning and
three measures in the evening – the total is seven. This is one of the
most secret laws – the total is always the same.</p><p><br></p><p>You may not be able to comprehend it, but when a beggar or an emperor
dies, their total is the same. The beggar lived on the streets, the
emperor lived in the palaces, but the total is the same. A rich man, a
poor man, a successful man and a failure, the total is the same. If you
can look at the total of life, then you will come to know what Chuang
Tzu means by the three in the morning.</p><p><br></p><p>What happens? Life is not impartial, life is not partial, life is
absolutely indifferent to your arrangements – it doesn’t bother about
the arrangements you make. Life is a gift. If you change the
arrangement, the total is not changed.</p><p><br></p><p>A rich man has found better food, but the hunger is lost; he cannot
really feel the intensity of being hungry. The proportion is always the
same. He has found a beautiful bed, but with the bed comes insomnia. He
has made better arrangements for sleeping. He should be falling asleep
into SUSHUPTI – what Hindus call unconscious samadhi – but that is not
happening. He cannot fall asleep. He has just changed the
arrangement.</p><p>A beggar is asleep just outside there in the street. Traffic is
passing and the beggar is asleep. He has no bed. The place where he is
sleeping is uneven, hard and uncomfortable, but he is asleep. The beggar
cannot get good food, it is impossible, because he has to beg. But he
has a good appetite. The total result is the same. The total result is
seven.</p><p><br></p><p>A successful man is not only successful, for with success comes all
sorts of calamities. A failure is not just a failure, for with failure
comes many sorts of blessings. The total is always the same, but the
total has to be penetrated and looked at, a clear perspective is needed.
Eyes are needed to look at the total because mind can look only at the
fragment. If the mind looks at the morning, it cannot look at the
evening; if it looks at the evening, the morning is forgotten. Mind
cannot look at the total day, mind is fragmentary.</p><p><br></p><p>Only a meditative consciousness can look at the whole, from birth to
death – and then the total is always seven. That is why wise men never
try to change the arrangement. That is why in the East no revolution has
ever happened – because revolution means changing the arrangement.</p><p><br></p><p>Look what happened in Soviet Russia. In 1917 the greatest revolution
happened on earth. The arrangement was changed. I don’t think Lenin,
Stalin or Trotsky ever heard the story of three in the morning. They
could have learned much from Chuang Tzu. But then there would have been
no revolution. What happened? The capitalists disappeared, now nobody
was rich, nobody was poor. The old classes were no more. But only names
changed. New classes came into being. Before, it was the rich man and
the poor man, the capitalist and the proletariat – now it was the
manager and the managed. But the distinction, the gap, remains the same.
Nothing has changed. Only now you call the capitalist the manager!</p><p>Those who have studied the Russian revolution say that this is not a
socialist revolution, it is a managerial revolution. The same gap, the
same distance, remains between the two classes, and a classless society
has not come into being.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu would have laughed. He would have told this story. What
have you done? The manager has become powerful, the managed have
remained powerless.</p><p>Hindus say that some people will always be managers and some people
will always be managed. There are SUDRAS and KSHATRIYAS; and these are
not just labels, these are types of people. Hindus have divided society
into four classes and they say that society can never be classless. It
is not a question of social arrangement – four types of people exist.
Unless you change the type, no revolution is of much help.</p><p><br></p><p>They say there is a type which is a laborer, sudra, who will always
be managed. If nobody manages him, he will be at a loss, he will not be
happy. He needs somebody to order him, he needs somebody whom he can
obey, he needs somebody who can take all the responsibility. He is not
ready to take the responsibility on his own. That is a type. If the
manager is around only then will that type of person work. If the
manager is not there, he will simply sit.</p><p>The manager can be a subtle phenomenon, even invisible. For example,
in a capitalist society the profit motive manages. A sudra works not
because he loves working, not because work is his hobby, not because he
is creative, but because he has to feed himself and his family. If he
does not work, who will feed him? It is the profit motive, hunger, body,
the stomach, that manages.</p><p>In a communist country this motive is not the manager. There they
have to put visible managers. It is said that in Stalin’s Russia there
was one policeman for each citizen; otherwise it is difficult to manage
because the profit motive is not there any longer. One has to force, one
has to order, one has to nag constantly, only then will the sudra
work.</p><p><br></p><p>There is always a businessman type who enjoys money, wealth,
accumulation. He will do that – it makes no difference how he does it.
If money is available, he will collect money; if money is not available,
then he will collect postage stamps. But he will do it, he will collect.
If postage stamps are not available he will collect followers – but he
will collect! He has to do something with numbers. He will have ten
thousand, twenty thousand followers, one million followers. That is just
the same as saying that he has got one million rupees!</p><p><br></p><p>Go to your sadhus – the greater the number of followers, the greater
they are. So followers are just nothing but bank balances. If nobody
follows you, you are nobody – then you are a poor guru. If</p><p><br></p><p>many people follow you then you are a rich guru. Whatsoever happens,
the businessman will collect. He will count. The material is
immaterial.</p><p>There is a warrior who will fight – any excuse will do. He will
fight, fighting is in his blood, in his bones. Because of his type the
world cannot live in peace. It is impossible. Once every ten years there
is bound to be a big war. And if you want to avoid big wars, then have
many small wars, but the total will remain the same. Because of the
atomic and hydrogen bombs, now a great war has become almost impossible.
That is why there are so many small wars all over the world: in Vietnam,
Kashmir, Bangladesh, Israel, many small wars, but the total will be the
same. In five thousand years man has fought fifteen thousand wars, three
wars per year.</p><p>A type exists who has to fight. You can change this type, but the
change will be superficial. If this warrior is not allowed to fight in
war, he will fight in other ways. He will fight an election, or he may
be- come a sportsman – he may fight in cricket or football. But he will
fight, he will compete, he needs somebody to challenge. Somewhere or
other fighting has to be done to satisfy him. That is why, as
civilization develops, people have to be supplied with more and more
games. If games are not given to the warrior type, what will he do?</p><p><br></p><p>Go and watch when a cricket, football, or hockey match is on – people
go mad, as if something very serious is going on, as if a real war is
happening! The players are serious, and the fans around them go mad.
Fights break out, riots happen. The playing field is always dangerous,
because the type that gathers there is the warrior type. Any moment
anything can go wrong.</p><p>There is a brahmin type, who always lives in words, in scriptures. In
the West there is no such type as the brahmin; the name is not
important, but the brahmin exists everywhere. Your scientists, your
professors, the universities are filled with them. They keep on working
with words, symbols, creating theories, defending, arguing. They keep on
doing it sometimes in the name of science, sometimes in the name of
religion, sometimes in the name of literature. The names change, but the
brahmin goes on.</p><p><br></p><p>There are these four types. You cannot create a classless society.
These four will persist and the total arrangement will be the same.
Fragments can change. In the morning you can do one thing, in the
evening something different, but the total day will remain the same.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about a young scientist whose father was against his
scientific research. The father always thought it useless. He told his
son, “Don’t waste your time. It is better to become a doctor, that will
be more practical and helpful to people. Just theories, abstract
theories of physics, are of no help.” Finally he persuaded his son and
he became a doctor.</p><p><br></p><p>The first man who came to him was suffering from severe pneumonia.
The doctor consulted his books – because he was an abstract thinker, a
brahmin. He tried and tried. The patient became more impatient, he said,
“How long do I have to wait?”</p><p>The scientist who was now a doctor said, “I don’t think that there is
any hope. You will have to die. There is no treatment for this illness,
it has gone beyond cure.” The patient was a tailor, he went home.</p><p><br></p><p>Two weeks later the doctor was passing and he saw the tailor working,
healthy and full of energy. So he said, “What, are you still alive? You
should have been dead long ago. I have consulted the books and this is
impossible. How do you manage to be alive?”</p><p>The tailor said, “You told me that within a week I would have to die,
so I thought: Then why not live?</p><p>Just a week left And potato pancakes are my weakness, so I left your
surgery, went straight to the cafe, ate thirty-two potato pancakes and
immediately I felt a great surge of energy. And now I am absolutely
okay!”</p><p>Right away the doctor noted down in his diary that thirty-two potato
pancakes is a sure cure for severe cases of pneumonia.</p><p><br></p><p>The next patient by chance also had pneumonia. He was a shoemaker.
The doctor said, “Don’t worry. Now the cure has been discovered.
Immediately go and eat thirty-two potato pancakes, not less than
thirty-two, and you will be okay; otherwise, you will die within a
week.”</p><p>After a week, the doctor knocked at the shoemaker’s door. It was
locked. The neighbor said, “He is dead. Your potato pancakes killed
him.” Immediately he noted in his diary: Thirty-two potato pancakes help
tailors, kill shoemakers.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the abstract mind. He cannot be practical, the brahmin.</p><p><br></p><p>You can change surfaces, you can paint faces, but the inner type
remains the same. Hence the East has not troubled itself with
revolutions. The East is waiting; and those in the East who are wise,
they look at the West, and they know that you are playing with toys. All
your revolutions are toys. Sooner or later you will come to realize the
law of three in the morning.</p><p>What is this three in the morning? A disciple must have asked Chuang
Tzu, because whenever somebody mentioned revolution or change, Chuang
Tzu would laugh and say, “The law of the three in the morning.” So a
disciple must have asked, “What is this three in the morning you are
always talking about?”</p><p><br></p><p>Said Chuang Tzu:</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS ABOUT A MONKEY TRAINER</p><p>WHO WENT TO HIS MONKEYS AND TOLD THEM:</p><p><br></p><p>“AS REGARDS YOUR CHESTNUTS,</p><p><br></p><p>YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THREE MEASURES IN THE MORNING,</p><p><br></p><p>AND FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON.”</p><p><br></p><p>ON HEARING THIS ALL THE MONKEYS BECAME ANGRY<span class=s5></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>Because in the past they had been getting four measures in the
morning and three in the evening. Obviously they got angry! “What do you
mean? We always used to get four measures of chestnuts in the morning
and now you say three. We cannot tolerate this.”</p><p><br></p><p>SO THE KEEPER SAID:</p><p><br></p><p>“ALL RIGHT THEN,</p><p><br></p><p>I WILL CHANGE IT</p><p><br></p><p>TO FOUR MEASURES IN THE MORNING,</p><p><br></p><p>AND THREE IN THE AFTERNOON.”</p><p>THE ANIMALS WERE SATISFIED WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>The total remained the same...but monkeys cannot look at the total.
It was morning, so they could only see the morning. Every morning it was
routine to get four measures and they expected four measures, and now
this man says, “Three measures in the morning.” He is cutting down by
one measure. It cannot be tolerated. They became angry, they
revolted.</p><p><br></p><p>But this monkey trainer must have been a wise man. If you are not, it
is difficult to become a monkey trainer. I know it from my own
experience. I am a monkey trainer.</p><p><br></p><p>The monkey trainer said, “Okay, then don’t get disturbed. I will
follow the old pattern. You will get four measures in the morning and
three in the evening.” The monkeys were happy. Poor monkeys! – they can
be happy or unhappy without any reason for either. But this man had a
bigger perspective. He could see, he could add four plus three. It was
still the same – seven measures were to be given to them. How they had
it and in what arrangement didn’t matter. The two arrangements were the
same, the number of chestnuts didn’t change, but in one case the monkeys
were displeased and in the other case they were satisfied.</p><p>This is how your mind works: you just keep changing the arrangement.
With one arrangement you feel satisfied, with another you feel
dissatisfied – and the total remains the same. But you never look at the
total. The mind cannot see the total. Only meditation can see the total.
Mind looks at the fragment, it is near-sighted, very near-sighted. That
is why whenever you feel pleasure, you immediately jump into it, you
never look at the evening. Whenever there is pleasure there is pain
hidden in it. This has been your experience but you have not become
aware of it. The pain will come in the evening but the pleasure is here
in the morning.</p><p><br></p><p>You never look into that which is hidden, into that which is
invisible, into that which is latent. You just look at the surface and
you go mad. You do this all your life. A fragment catches you. Many
people come to me and say, “In the beginning when I married this woman,
everything was very beautiful. But within days everything was lost. Now
it has all become ugly, now it is misery.”</p><p>Once there was a car accident. The car overturned in a ditch by the
side of the road. The man was lying on the ground completely crippled,
almost unconscious. A policeman came along and started to fill in his
notebook. He asked the man, “Are you married?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “I am not married. This is the biggest mess I have ever
been in.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that those who know will never marry. But how can you know
what happens in marriage without getting married? You look at a person,
at the fragment, and sometimes the fragment will look very foolish when
you think about it in the end.</p><p>The color of the eyes – what foolishness! How can your life depend on
the color of your or somebody else’s eyes? How can your life be
beautiful just because of the color of the eyes? – a small pigment,
three or four pennies’ worth. But you get romantic: Oh, the eyes, the
color of the eyes. Then you go mad and you think, “If I am not married
to this woman life is lost, I will commit suicide.”</p><p><br></p><p>But you don’t see what you are doing. One cannot live by the color of
the eyes forever. Within two days you will become acquainted with those
eyes and you will forget them. Then there is the whole of life in front
of you, the totality of it. Then starts misery. Before the honeymoon is
finished, misery begins; the total person was never taken into account –
the mind cannot see the total. It just looks at the surface, at the
figure, the face, the hair, the color of the eyes, the way the woman
walks, the way she talks, the sound of her voice. These are the parts,
but where is the total person?</p><p><br></p><p>The mind cannot see the total. The mind looks at fragments, and with
fragments it gets hooked. Once it is hooked, the total comes in – the
total is not far away. Eyes don’t exist as separate phenomena, they are
part of a whole person. If you are hooked by the eyes, you are hooked
with the whole person. And when this whole emerges, everything becomes
ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>So who is responsible? You should have taken account of the whole.
But when it is morning the mind looks at the morning and forgets the
evening completely. Remember well – in every morning the evening is
hidden. The morning is constantly turning into evening and nothing can
be done about it, you cannot stop it.</p><p><br></p><p>Says Chuang Tzu:</p><p><br></p><p>THE TWO ARRANGEMENTS WERE THE SAME –</p><p><br></p><p>THE NUMBER OF CHESTNUTS DID NOT CHANGE,</p><p><br></p><p>BUT IN ONE CASE THE MONKEYS WERE DISPLEASED, AND IN THE OTHER CASE
THEY WERE SATISFIED.</p><p>Monkeys are your minds; they cannot penetrate the whole. This is the
misery. You always miss, you always miss because of the fragment. If you
can see the whole and then act, your life will never be a hell. And then
you will not be bothered about superficial arrangements, about morning
and evening, because then you can count – and it is always seven.
Whether you get four or three in the morning makes no difference – the
total is seven.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that a small boy came home from school very puzzled. His
mother asked, “Why do you look so puzzled?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy said, “I am in a muddle. I think my teacher has gone crazy.
Yesterday she said that four plus one make five and today she told me
three plus two make five. She must have gone mad, because when four plus
one is already five, how can three plus two be five?”</p><p><br></p><p>The child cannot see that five can come out of many arrangements –
there is not only one arrangement which will total five. There can be
millions of arrangements in which the total will be five.</p><p>Howsoever you arrange your life the religious man will always look to
the total and the worldly man will always look to the fragment. That is
the difference. The worldly will look to whatever is near, and not see
the far hidden there. The distant is not really very far away, it will
become the near, it will happen soon. The evening is coming.</p><p><br></p><p>Can you have a perspective in which the total life is seen? It is
believed, and I think it is true also, that if a man is drowning,
suddenly his whole life, the total, is remembered. You are dying,
drowning in a river, with no time left, and suddenly in your mind’s eye
your whole life is revealed from beginning to end. It is as if the whole
film passes across the screen of the mind. But what use is it now that
you are dying?</p><p><br></p><p>A religious man looks at the total every moment. The whole of life is
there, and then he acts out of that perspective of the whole. He will
never regret as you always do. It is inevitable that whatsoever you do,
you will regret it.</p><p>One day the king went to visit a madhouse. The superintendent of the
madhouse escorted him to every cell. The king was very interested in the
phenomenon of madness, he was studying it. Everybody should be
interested because it is everybody’s problem. And you need not go to a
madhouse: go anywhere and study people’s faces. You are studying in a
madhouse!</p><p><br></p><p>One man was weeping and crying, hitting his head against the bars.
His anguish was so deep, his suffering so penetrating, that the king
asked to be told the whole story of how this man went mad. The
superintendent said, “This man loved a woman and couldn’t get her, so he
went mad.”</p><p>Then they passed to another cell. In it there was a man spitting on a
picture of a woman. The king</p><p>asked, “And what is the story of this man? He also seems to be
involved with a woman.”</p><p>The superintendent said, “It is the same woman. This man fell in love
with her too, and he got her.</p><p>That is why he went mad.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you get what you want you go mad; if you don’t get what you want
you go mad. The total remains the same. Whatsoever you do, you will
regret it. A fragment can never be fulfilling. The whole is so big and
the fragment is so small that you cannot deduce the whole from the
fragment. And if you depend on the fragment and decide your life
accordingly, you will always miss. Your whole life will be wasted.</p><p>So what should we do? What does Chuang Tzu want us to do? He wants us
not to be fragmentary – he wants us to be total. But remember, you can
look at the total only when YOU are total, because only the similar can
know the similar. If you are fragmentary, you cannot know the total. How
can you know the total if you are fragmentary? If you are divided in
parts the total cannot be reflected in you. When I speak of meditation I
mean a mind which is no longer divided, in which all fragments have
disappeared. The mind is undivided, whole, one.</p><p><br></p><p>This one mind looks deeply to the very end. It looks from death to
birth, it looks from birth to death. Both the polarities are before it.
And out of this look, out of this penetrating vision, the action is
born. If you ask me what sin is, I will say: Action out of the
fragmentary mind is sin. If you ask me what virtue is, I will tell you:
Action out of the total mind is virtue. That is why a sinner always has
to repent.</p><p>Remember your own life, observe it. Whatsoever you do, whatsoever you
choose, this or that, everything goes wrong. Whether you get the woman
or lose her, in either case you go mad. Whatsoever you choose, you
choose misery. Hence Krishnamurti constantly insists on
choicelessness.</p><p><br></p><p>Try to understand this. You are here listening to me. This is a
choice, because you must have left some job undone, some work
incomplete. You have to go to the office, to the shop, to the family, to
the market and you are here listening to me. This morning you must have
decided what to do. Whether to go and listen to this man or go to your
work, to the office, to the market. Then you made the choice to come
here.</p><p><br></p><p>You made the choice to come here. You will regret your choice...
because even while here, you cannot be totally here: half of the mind is
there, and you are simply waiting until I finish so you can go. But do
you think that if you had chosen otherwise, gone to the shop or to the
office, would you have been totally there? No, because that again was a
choice. So you will be there and your mind will be here. And you will
regret: What am I missing? Who knows what is being done there, what is
being talked about? Who knows what secret key is to be transferred this
morning?</p><p><br></p><p>So whatsoever you choose, whether you come or whether you decide not
to come, if it is a choice it means half of the heart, or a little more,
has chosen. It is a democratic decision, parliamentary. With the
majority of the mind you have decided, but the minority is still there.
And no minority is a fixed thing, no majority is a fixed thing. Nobody
knows its size, party members keep changing sides.</p><p><br></p><p>When you came here you decided. Fifty-one percent of your mind wanted
to come and forty-nine wanted to go to the office. But by the time you
arrive here the arrangement has changed. The very decision to come and
listen creates a disturbance.</p><p>The minority may have become the majority by the time you arrive
here. If it has not yet become a majority, by the time you leave it will
have, and you will think, “Two hours wasted? Now, how will I make them
up? It would have been better not to come – spiritual things can be
postponed, but this world cannot be postponed. Life is long enough, we
can meditate later on.”</p><p><br></p><p>In India people say that meditation is only for the old. Once they
are on the verge of death then they can meditate, it is not for young
people. Meditation is the last thing on the list; do it when you have
done everything else. But remember that the time never comes when you
have done everything, when you are too old to do anything else, when all
your energy has been wasted, when it is time to meditate.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are incapable of doing anything how can you meditate?
Meditation needs energy, the purest, most vital – meditation needs
energy overflowing. A child can meditate but how can an old man
meditate? A child is easily meditative, an old man – no, he is wasted.
There is no movement of energy in him, his river cannot flow, he is
frozen. Many parts of his life are already dead.</p><p><br></p><p>If you choose to come to the temple, you suffer, you regret. If you
go to the office or the market, you suffer and regret.</p><p>It happened once that a monk died. He was a very famous monk, known
all over the country. Many people worshipped him and thought he was
enlightened. And on the same day a prostitute died. She lived just in
front of the monk’s temple. She was also a very famous prostitute, as
famous as the monk. They were two polarities living next to each other
and they died on the same day.</p><p><br></p><p>The angel of death came and took the monk to heaven; other angels of
death came and took the prostitute to hell. When the angels reached
heaven the doors were closed and the man in charge said, “You have
confused them. This monk has to go to hell and the prostitute has to
come to heaven.”</p><p><br></p><p>The angels said, “What do you mean? This man was a very famous
ascetic, continuously meditating and praying. That is why we never
inquired, we simply went and fetched him. And the prostitute must
already be in hell because the other group of angels took her there. We
never thought of asking, it seemed so obvious.”</p><p><br></p><p>Said the man who was in charge at the gate: “You are confused because
you have looked only at the surface. This monk used to meditate for the
benefit of others, but for himself he was always thinking, ‘I am missing
life. What a beautiful woman that prostitute is, and available. Any
moment I cross the street, she is available. What I am doing is a lot of
nonsense – praying, sitting in a buddha posture and attaining nothing.’
But because of his reputation he didn’t dare do it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Many people are virtuous because they are cowards like him. He was
virtuous because he was a coward – he could not cross the street. So
many people knew him, how could he go to the prostitute? What would
people say?</p><p>Cowards are always afraid of the opinion of others. So he remained an
ascetic, fasting, but his mind was always with the prostitute. When
there was singing and dancing, he would listen. He sat before the statue
of Buddha, but Buddha was not there. He was not worshipping; he would
dream he was listening to the sounds of festivities, and in his fantasy
he would make love to the prostitute.</p><p>And what about the prostitute? She was always repenting, repenting
and repenting, She knew she had wasted her life, she had wasted a golden
opportunity. And for what? Just for money, selling her body and soul.
She always used to look towards the monk’s temple, so jealous of the
silent life there. What meditative phenomenon was happening there?</p><p><br></p><p>She longed for God to give her one chance to go inside the temple.
But she thought, “I am a prostitute, unholy, and I should not enter the
temple.” So she used to walk around the temple from the outside, just to
look at it from the street. What beauty, what silence, what blessing
inside! And when there was KIRTAN and BHAJAN, singing and dancing, she
used to wail and cry and scream, imagining what she was missing.</p><p><br></p><p>So the man in charge of the gates said, “Bring the prostitute to
heaven and take this monk to hell. Their outer life was different and
their inner life was different, but like everybody else they both had
reg rets.”</p><p><br></p><p>We in India have invented a word which does not exist in any other
language in the world. Heaven and hell are found everywhere; all
languages everywhere have words for heaven and hell. We have a different
word: it is MOKSHA or nirvana or KAIVALYA – the absolute freedom which
is neither hell nor heaven.</p><p>If your outer life is hell and you repent of it, you will reach
heaven, like the prostitute who constantly desired the world of
meditation and prayer. And if your outer life is heaven and your inner
life is hell, like the monk who desired the prostitute, you will go to
hell. But if you make no choice, have no regrets, if you are choiceless,
then you will reach moksha.</p><p><br></p><p>Choiceless awareness is moksha, absolute freedom. Hell is a bondage,
heaven is also a bondage. Heaven may be a beautiful prison, hell may be
an ugly prison – but both are prisons. Neither Christians nor
Mohammedans can follow this point, because to them heaven is the
ultimate. If you ask them where Jesus is, their answer is wrong. They
say: In heaven with God. This is absolutely wrong. If Jesus is in
heaven, then he is not enlightened. Heaven may be golden, but it is
still a prison. It may be good, it may be pleasant, but it is still a
choice, the choice against hell. The virtue which has been chosen
against sin is a decision of the majority, but the minority is just
behind waiting for its chance to decide.</p><p>Jesus is in moksha, that is what I say. He is not in heaven, he is
not in hell. He is totally free of all imprisonments: good/bad,
sin/virtue, morality/immorality. He did not choose. He lived a
choiceless life. And that is what I keep on telling you: Live a
choiceless life.</p><p><br></p><p>But how is a choiceless life possible? It is possible only if you can
see the total, the seven; otherwise, you will choose. You will say this
should happen in the morning, that in the evening, and you think that
just by changing the arrangement you are changing the total. The total
cannot be changed. The total remains the same – everybody’s total
remains the same.</p><p>Hence I say there is no difference between a beggar and an emperor.
In the morning you are an emperor, in the evening you will be a beggar;
in the morning you are a beggar, in the evening you will be an emperor.
And the total remains the same. Look at the total, BE total, and then
all choice drops.</p><p><br></p><p>That monkey trainer simply looked at the total and said, “Okay, you
foolish monkeys, if you are happy with it, let this arrangement be as it
is.” But if he had also been a monkey, like the others, then there would
have been a fight. Then he would have insisted, “This is going to be the
arrangement. Who gives the orders, who makes the decisions? Who do you
think is the master? You or me?”</p><p><br></p><p>Ego always chooses, decides and forces. The monkeys were rebelling,
and if this man had also been a monkey they would have driven him mad.
He would have had to put them in their place, back where they belonged.
He would have insisted, “No more four in the morning. I decide.”</p><p>It was the sixtieth birthday of a man. He came home that night after
a long married life of almost forty years, full of quarrels and
conflict. But he was surprised when he came home to find his wife
waiting for him with two beautiful ties as a present. He never expected
it from his wife. It was almost impossible that she would wait for him
with two ties as a present. He felt so happy, he said, “Don’t cook the
dinner, I will get ready in a couple of minutes and we will go to the
best restaurant in town.”</p><p><br></p><p>He had a bath, got ready, and put on one of the ties she had given
him. His wife stared and said, “What? Do you mean you don’t like the
other tie? So isn’t the other tie good enough?” A man can only wear one
tie at one time but whichever tie he had chosen, the same would have
happened: “So what do you mean? The other one isn’t good enough?”</p><p>It is the old habit of quarreling, fighting. It was said about the
same woman that every day she would find something to fight about. And
she would always succeed, because when you search, you will find.
Remember this: whatsoever you are looking for you will find. The world
is so vast, and existence is so rich, that if you are really keen to
find something, you will find it.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes she found hair on her husband’s coat, and then she would
fight about him going with some other woman. But once it happened that
for seven days she could not find anything wrong. She tried and tried
and there was no excuse to pick a fight. So on the seventh day, when her
husband came home, she started screaming and beating her chest. He said,
“Now what are you doing? What is the matter, what happened?”</p><p>So she said, “You rascal, you have finished with other women and now
you are going around with bald women!”</p><p><br></p><p>The mind is always looking for trouble. And don’t laugh, because this
is about YOUR mind. By laughing you may be simply deceiving yourself.
You may think it is about somebody else – it is about you. And
whatsoever I say, it is always about you.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind chooses and always chooses trouble, because with choice comes
trouble. You cannot choose God. If you choose, there will be trouble.
You cannot choose sannyas. If you choose, there will be trouble. You
cannot choose freedom. If you choose, it will not be freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>Then how does it happen? How does God happen, sannyas happen, freedom
happen, moksha happen? It happens when you understand the foolishness of
choice. It is not a new choice, it is simply the dropping of all
choosing. Just looking at the whole thing you start laughing. There is
nothing to choose. The total remains the same. In the end, by the
evening, the total will be the same. Then you won’t be bothered whether
in the morning you are an emperor or a beggar. You are happy, because by
evening everything has come to the same, everything has been
leveled.</p><p><br></p><p>Death equalizes. In death nobody is an emperor and nobody is a
beggar. Death reveals the total; it is always seven.</p><p>The two arrangements were the same. Remember, the amount of chestnuts
didn’t change. But in</p><p>one case the monkeys were displeased and in the other case they were
satisfied. THE KEEPER WAS WILLING</p><p>TO CHANGE HIS PERSONAL ARRANGEMENT IN ORDER TO MEET OBJECTIVE
CONDITIONS. HE LOST NOTHING BY IT.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of understanding always looks at objective conditions, never at
his subjective feelings. When the monkeys said no, if you had been the
monkey trainer you would have felt offended. These monkeys were trying
to rebel, they were being disobedient, this could not be toler-ated. It
would have hurt you inside.</p><p>You get angry even at dead things. If you are trying to open the door
and it resists, you get mad. If you are trying to write a letter and the
pen is not functioning well, smoothly, you get angry. You feel hurt, as
if the pen is doing it knowingly, as if there is someone in the boat.
You even feel somebody is there in the pen trying to disturb you.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is not only the logic of small children, this is your logic
also. If a child bumps into a table, he will hit it just to right the
wrong, and he will always be an enemy of that table. But you are the
same – with dead things, with objects, you also get angry, you get
mad!</p><p>This is subjective, and a wise man is never subjective. A wise man
always looks at the objective conditions. He will look at the door, and
if it is not open, then he will try to open it. But he cannot get angry
with it because the boat is empty. There is nobody there trying to shut
the door, resisting your efforts.</p><p><br></p><p>In order to meet objective conditions the trainer changed his
personal arrangement. He looked at the monkeys and their minds, he
didn’t feel offended – he was a monkey trainer, not a monkey. He looked
and he must have laughed within, because he knew the total. And he
yielded. Only a wise man yields. A foolish man always resists. Foolish
people say it is better to die than to bend, better to break than to
bend.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu always say: When there is a strong wind the
foolish egoistic trees resist and die, and the wise grass bends. The
storm goes by and again the grass stands straight, laughing and
enjoying. The grass is objective, the big tree is subjective. The big
tree thinks so much of himself: “I am somebody, who can bend me? Who can
force me to yield?” The big tree will fight with a storm. It is foolish
to fight with the storm, because the storm has not come for you. It is
nothing special, the storm is simply passing and you are there, it is
coincidental.</p><p>Monkeys are animals and think themselves very superior animals! They
are not offending the monkey trainer. Monkeys are just monkeys. That is
the way they are. They cannot look at the total, they cannot add up.
They can look only at the near, not at the far – the far is too far for
them. It is impossible for them to conceive of the evening, they only
know about the morning.</p><p><br></p><p>So monkeys are monkeys, storms are storms. Why get offended? They are
not fighting you. They are only following their own ways, their own
habits. So the monkey trainer was not offended. He was a wise man, he
yielded, he was just like the grass. Remember this when-ever you start
feeling subjective. If somebody says something, immediately you feel
hurt, as if it has been said to you. You are in the boat too much. It
may not have been said to you at all. The other may be expressing his or
her subjectivity.</p><p><br></p><p>When somebody says, “You have insulted me,” what is really meant is
something else. If he had been a little more intelligent he would have
said it the other way around. He would be saying, “I feel insulted. You
may not have insulted me, but whatsoever you have said, I feel
insul-ted.” This is a subjective feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>But nobody realizes their subjectivity and everyone goes on
projecting subjectivity onto objective conditions. The other always
says, “You have insulted me.” And when you hear it you are also
subjective. Both boats are filled, much too crowded. There is bound to
be a clash, enmity, violence.</p><p>If you are wise, when the other says, “You have insulted me,” you
will look at the matter objectively and you will think, “Why is the
other feeling insulted?” You will try to understand the other’s
feelings, and if you can put things right you will yield. Monkeys are
monkeys. Why get angry, why feel offended?</p><p><br></p><p>It is said of Mulla Nasruddin that when he was old he was made an
honorary magistrate. The first case to come before him was a man who had
been robbed. Nasruddin heard his story and said, “Yes, you are in the
right.” But he hadn’t yet heard the other story!</p><p><br></p><p>The clerk of the court whispered in his ear, “You are new, Nasruddin.
You don’t know what you are</p><p>doing. You have to listen to the other side before you give
judgment.” So Nasruddin said, “Okay.”</p><p>The other man, the robber, told his story. Nasruddin listened and
said, “You are right.”</p><p>The clerk of the court felt confused: “This new magistrate is not
only inexperienced, he is crazy.” Again he whispered in his ear, “What
are you doing? Both cannot be right.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin said, “Yes, you are right.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the wise man who looks at the objective conditions. He will
yield. He is always yielding, he is always saying yes – because if you
say no, then your boat is not empty. No always comes from the ego. So if
a wise man has to say no, he will still use the terminology of yes. He
will not say no outright, he will use the terminology of yes. If a
foolish man wants to say yes, he will feel the difficulty of not saying
no. He will use the terminology of no, and if he has to yield, he will
yield grudgingly. He will yield offended, resisting. The monkey trainer
yielded.</p><p><br></p><p>THE KEEPER WAS WILLING</p><p>TO CHANGE HIS PERSONAL ARRANGEMENTS IN ORDER TO MEET OBJECTIVE
CONDITIONS. HE LOST NOTHING BY IT.</p><p>No wise man has ever lost anything by saying yes to foolish people.
No wise man can ever lose anything by yielding. He gains everything.
There is no ego, so there cannot be any loss. The loss is always felt by
the ego: I am losing. Why do you feel you are losing? – because you
never wanted to lose. Why do you feel you are a failure? – because you
always wanted to be a success. Why do you feel you are a beggar? –
because you always desired to be an emperor.</p><p>A wise man simply takes whatever is. He accepts the total. He knows –
beggar in the morning, emperor in the evening; and emperor in the
morning, beggar in the evening. Which is the better arrangement?</p><p><br></p><p>If a wise man is forced to arrange he would like to be beggar in the
morning and emperor in the evening. A wise man never chooses, but if you
insist, he will say that it is better to be beggar in the morning and
emperor in the evening. Why? – because to be emperor first, in the
morning, then to be beggar in the evening, will be very difficult. But
this is the choice.</p><p>A wise man will choose pain in the beginning and pleasure in the end,
because pain in the beginning will give you the background, and against
it the pleasure will be more pleasing than ever. Pleasure in the
beginning will give you a soft background and then the pain will be too
much, unbearable.</p><p>East and West have made different arrangements. In the East, for the
first twenty-five years of life every child had to go through hardship.
That was the principle followed for thousands of years until the West
came and began dominating the East.</p><p><br></p><p>A child had to go to the master’s house in the jungle, he had to live
through every possible hardship. Like a beggar he would sleep on a mat
on the floor – there were no comforts. He would eat like a beggar; he
would have to go to town and beg for the master, chop wood, take the
animals to the river to drink, to the forest to feed.</p><p><br></p><p>For twenty-five years he led the most simple, austere life whether he
was born a king or a beggar – there was no difference. Even the
emperor’s son had to follow the same routine, there was no distinction.
And then when he came to know life in the world, life was so
blissful.</p><p><br></p><p>If the East was so content, this was the trick, the arrangement,
because whatsoever life gives it is always more than you started with.
The child comes to live in a hut. To him it is a palace compared with
lying on the ground without any shelter, crowded. He has an ordinary
bed, and it is heavenly. Ordinary food, bread, butter and salt is
paradise enough, because there was no butter at the master’s house. He
is happy with whatsoever life gives.</p><p>Now, the Western pattern is the opposite. When you are a student
every comfort is given to you. Hostels, beautiful universities,
beautiful rooms, classrooms, teachers – every arrangement is made for
your medical facilities, food, hygiene, everything is taken care of. And
after twenty-five years of this you are thrown into the struggle of
life. You have become a hot-house plant! – you don’t know what struggle
is. Then you become a clerk in an office, a master in a primary school:
life is hell. Then all your life you will be grunting, your whole life
will be a long grump, complaining, complaining, everything is wrong. It
is going to be so.</p><p>The monkey trainer said, “Three helpings in the morning and four in
the evening.” But the monkeys insisted: “Four in the morning and three
in the evening.”</p><p>Four in the morning and three in the evening...then the evening is
going to be cloudy. You will compare it with the past, with the morning.
Emperor in the morning and a beggar in the evening...then the evening is
going to be miserable. The evening should be the climax, not
miserable.</p><p>The monkeys are not choosing a wise arrangement. In the first place a
wise man never chooses, he lives choicelessly because he knows that
whatever happens the total is going to be the same. In the</p><p><br></p><p>second place, if he has to choose because of objective conditions, he
will choose three courses in the morning and four in the evening. But
the monkeys said, “No. We will choose. We will have four in the
morning.” That trainer, the keeper, was willing to comply in order to
meet objective conditions. He lost nothing by it. But what happened to
the monkeys? They lost something.</p><p>So whenever you are near a wise man let him make the arrangements,
don’t insist on your own. To choose in the first place is wrong, and in
the second place, whatsoever choice you monkeys make, it will be wrong.
The monkey mind only looks for immediate, instant happiness. The monkey
is not worried about what happens later on. He doesn’t know, he has no
perspective of the whole. So let the wise man choose.</p><p>But the whole arrangement has changed. In the East the wise men
decided. In the West there is democracy: the monkeys vote and choose.
And now they have converted the whole East to democracy – democracy
means that the monkeys vote and choose.</p><p><br></p><p>Aristocracy means that the wise men will choose the arrangement and
the monkeys will yield and follow. Nothing can work like aristocracy if
aristocracy is run properly. Democracy is bound to be a chaos. The
monkeys feel very happy because they are choosing the arrangement, but
the world was happier when the choice was with wise men.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, kings always used to go to ask the wise men to make the
final decision on important matters. The wise men were not kings because
they couldn’t be bothered with it, they were beggars, living in their
huts in the forest. Whenever there was a problem the king did not run to
the constituency to ask the people, “What is to be done?” He ran to the
forest to ask those who had renounced all – because they have a
perspective of the whole, no attachment, no obsessions, nothing, by
their own choice. They are choiceless; they see the whole and
decide.</p><p><br></p><p>THE TRULY WISE MAN,</p><p><br></p><p>CONSIDERING BOTH SIDES OF THE QUESTION WITHOUT PARTIALITY,</p><p>SEES THEM BOTH IN THE LIGHT OF TAO.</p><p><br></p><p>THIS IS CALLED FOLLOWING TWO COURSES AT ONCE.</p><p><br></p><p>To look at the total means to follow two courses at once. Then it is
not a question of four in the morning, three in the evening. It is a
question of seven in the whole life.</p><p><br></p><p>Arrangement is immaterial. Arrangements can be made according to
objective conditions, but there will be seven in all, two courses
together. The wise man looks at the whole of everything. Sex gives you
pleasure, but he looks also at the pain that comes out of it. Wealth
gives you pleasure, but he looks at the nightmare that comes with it.
Success makes you happy, but he knows the abyss that follows the peak,
the failure that will become intense, unbearable pain.</p><p><br></p><p>The wise man looks at the whole. And when you look at the whole you
have no choice. Then you are having two courses at the same time.
Morning and evening are together now – four plus three</p><p><br></p><p>are together now. Now nothing is in fragments, everything has become
a whole. And to follow this whole is Tao. To follow this whole is to be
religious. To follow this whole is Yoga.</p><p>Enough for today.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s3>6</span></p><p><br></p><p>The Need to Win</p><p><br></p><p>15 July 1974 am in Buddha Hall</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN AN ARCHER IS SHOOTING FOR FUN HE HAS ALL HIS SKILL.</p><p>IF HE SHOOTS FOR A BRASS BUCKLE HE IS ALREADY NERVOUS.</p><p>IF HE SHOOTS FOR A PRIZE OF GOLD HE GOES BLIND</p><p>OR SEES TWO TARGETS –</p><p><br></p><p>HE IS OUT OF HIS MIND.</p><p><br></p><p>HIS SKILL HAS NOT CHANGED, BUT THE PRIZE DIVIDES HIM. HE CARES.</p><p>HE THINKS MORE OF WINNING</p><p><br></p><p>101</p><p>101</p><p><br></p><p>THAN OF SHOOTING –</p><p><br></p><p>AND THE NEED TO WIN DRAINS HIM OF POWER.</p><p>If the mind is filled with dreams you cannot see rightly. If the
heart is filled with desires you cannot feel rightly. Desires, dreams
and hopes – the future disturbs you and divides you. But whatsoever is,
is in the present. Desire leads you into the future, and life is here
and now. Reality is here and now, and desire leads you into the future.
Then you are not here. You see, but still you don’t see; you hear, but
still you miss; you feel, but the feeling is dim, it cannot go deep, it
cannot be penetrating. That is how truth is missed.</p><p><br></p><p>People keep on asking: Where is the divine, where is the truth? It is
not a question of finding the divine or the truth. It is always here, it
has never been anywhere else, it cannot be. It is there where you are,
but you are not there, your mind is somewhere else. Your eyes are filled
with dreams, your heart is filled with desires. You move into the
future, and what is the future but illusion? Or, you move into the past,
and the past is already dead. The past is no more and the future has yet
to be. Between these two is the present moment. That moment is very
short, it is atomic, you cannot divide it, it is indivisible. That
moment passes in the flicker of an eye. If a desire enters, you have
missed it; if a dream is there, you are missing it.</p><p>The whole of religion consists of not leading you somewhere, but
bringing you to the here and now, bringing you back to the whole, back
where you have always been. But the head has gone away, very far away.
This head has to be brought back. So God is not to be sought somewhere –
because you are searching somewhere, that is why you are missing him. He
has been here all the time waiting for you.</p><p><br></p><p>Once it happened that Mulla Nasruddin came staggering home totally
drunk, and knocked many times at his own door. It was already half past
midnight. The wife answered and he asked her, “Can you tell me, madam,
where Mulla Nasruddin lives?”</p><p>The wife said, “This is too much. You are Mulla Nasruddin.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That’s right, that I know, but it doesn’t answer my
question. Where does he live?”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the situation. Drunk with desires, staggering along, you
knock at your own door and ask where your home is. Really, you ask who
you are. This is home, and you have never left it, it is impossible to
leave it. It is not something outside you which you can go away and
leave; it is your within, it is your very being.</p><p>Asking where God is, is foolish, because you cannot lose God. It is
your within, your innermost being, your very core. It is your existence:
you breathe in him, you live in him, and it cannot be otherwise. What
has happened is that you have become so drunk that you cannot recognize
your own face. And unless you come back and get sober you will go on
searching and seeking and you will go on missing.</p><p><br></p><p>Tao, Zen, Yoga, Sufism, Hassidism, these are all methods for bringing
you back, to make you sober again, to destroy your drunkenness. Why are
you so drunk? What makes you so drunk? Why are your eyes so sleepy? Why
aren’t you alert? What is the root cause of it all? The root cause is
that you desire.</p><p>Try to understand the nature of desire.</p><p><br></p><p>Desire is alcoholic, desire is the greatest drug possible. Marijuana
is nothing, lsd is nothing. Desire is the greatest lsd possible – the
ultimate in drugs.</p><p>What is the nature of desire? When you desire, what happens? When you
desire, you are creating an illusion in the mind; when you desire, you
have already moved from here. Now you are not here, you are absent from
here, because the mind is creating a dream. This absentness is your
drunkenness. Be present!</p><p><br></p><p>This very moment the doors of heaven are open. There is no need even
to knock because you are not outside heaven, you are already inside.
Just be alert and look around without eyes filled with desire, and you
will have a belly laugh. You will laugh at the whole joke, at what has
been happening. It is just like a man dreaming at night.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened once that a man was very much disturbed – his nights were
simply prolonged nightmares. His whole night was a struggle. It was so
painful that he was always scared to go to sleep and he was always happy
to get up. And the nature of the dreams was that the moment he fell
asleep, under his bed he would start seeing millions of lions, dragons,
tigers, crocodiles, all sitting under his small bed. So he dreamed that
he couldn’t sleep – at any moment they would attack.</p><p>His whole night was just a long disturbance, a torture, a hell. He
was treated medically, but nothing would help. Everything failed. He was
analyzed by psychologists, psychiatrists, but nothing worked. Then one
day he walked out of his house laughing.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody had seen him laughing for many years. His face had become
hellish, always sad, afraid, scared. So the neighbors asked, “What is
the matter? You are laughing? We have not seen you laugh for such a long
time, we have completely forgotten that you ever used to laugh. What
happened to your nightmares?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “I told my brother-in-law, and he cured me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The neighbors asked, “Is your brother-in-law some great
psycho-analyst? How did he cure you?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “He is a carpenter, and he simply sawed off the legs of
my bed. Now there’s no more space underneath, so I slept for the first
time!”</p><p>You create a space – and desire is the way to create the space. The
greater the desire, the more space is created. A desire may be fulfilled
in one year, then you have one year’s space. You can move in it, and you
will have to encounter many reptiles, many dragons. This space which is
created by desire, you call time. If there is no desire, there is no
need for time.</p><p><br></p><p>A single moment exists – not even two moments, because the second is
needed only by desire, it is not needed by your existence. Existence is
completely fulfilled, total, in one moment.</p><p>If you think that time is something outside you, remember that you
are mistaken. Time is not something outside you.</p><p>If man disappears from the earth will there be time? Trees will grow,
rivers will flow, clouds will still float in the sky, but I ask, will
there be time? There will not. There will be moments, rather, there will
be one moment – and when one moment disappears another comes into
existence, and so on. But there is no time as such. Only the atomic
moment exists.</p><p><br></p><p>Trees don’t desire anything, They don’t desire to flower, flowers
will come automatically. It is part of the nature of the tree that
flowers will come. But the tree is not dreaming, the tree is not moving,
it is not thinking, it is not desiring.</p><p><br></p><p>There will be no time, only eternal moments, if man is not there. You
create time by desire. The greater the desire, the more time is
needed.</p><p><br></p><p>But for materialistic desires much time is not needed. That is why in
the West they say that there is only one life. In the East, we have
desired moksha. That is the greatest desire possible – no other desire
can be greater than that. How can you get moksha in one life? One life
is not enough. You may get a palace, you may organize a kingdom, you may
become very rich and powerful, a Hitler, a Ford, you may become
something of this world, but moksha is such a great desire that one life
is not enough.</p><p><br></p><p>So in the East we believe in many lives, in rebirth, because more
time, many lives, will be needed to fulfill the desire for moksha. Only
then is there hope that the desire will be fulfilled. The point is not
whether there are many lives, or only one, but that in the East people
believe in many lives because they desire moksha.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have only one life then how can you attain moksha? Only
material things can be attained in one lifetime, spiritual
transformation as well is not possible. The desire is so huge that
millions of lifetimes are needed. That is why in the East people live so
lazily. There is no hurry because there is no shortage of time. You will
be born again and again and again so why be in a hurry? You have got
infinite time.</p><p>So if the East is lazy and seems so absolutely unaware of time, if
things move with such a slow flow, it is because of the concept of many
lives. If the West is so time-conscious, it is because there is only one
life, and everything has to be attained in it. If you miss, you miss
forever – no second opportunity is possible! Because of this shortage of
time, the West has become very tense. So many things to do and so little
time left in which to do them. There is never enough time and there are
so many desires.</p><p><br></p><p>People are always in a hurry, running fast. Nobody moves around
slowly. Everyone is running, and more speed is needed. So the West keeps
inventing faster vehicles and there is never any satisfaction with them.
The West goes on lengthening human life just to give you a little more
time to fulfill your desires.</p><p><br></p><p>But why is time needed? Can’t you be here and now without time? Is it
not enough, this moment, just sitting near me, no past, no future – this
moment in-between, which is atomic, which is really as if
nonexistential? It is so small that you cannot catch hold of it. If you
catch it, it is already past. If you think, it is in the future. You can
be IN it, but you cannot catch hold of it. When you catch hold of it, it
is gone; when you think about it, it is not there.</p><p>When it is there, only one thing can be done – you can live it, that
is all. It is so small that you can only live in it, but it is so vital
that it gives life to you.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, it is just like the atom, so small it cannot be seen.
Nobody, not even the scientists, have seen it yet. You can only see the
consequences. They have been able to explode it: Hiroshima and Nagasaki
were the consequences. We have seen Hiroshima burning, over one hundred
thousand people dead – this is the consequence. But no one has seen what
happened in the atomic explosion. Nobody has seen the atom with their
own eyes. There are no instruments yet which can see it.</p><p><br></p><p>Time is atomic, this moment is also atomic. Nobody can see it,
because the moment you see it, it has already gone. In the time that is
taken in seeing, it has gone – the river has flowed on, the arrow has
moved, and nobody has ever seen time. You go on using the word time, but
if someone insists on a definition you will be at a loss.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody asked Saint Augustine, “Define God. What do you mean when
you use the word god?”</p><p><br></p><p>And Augustine said, “It is just like time. I can talk about it, but
if you insist on the definition, I am at a loss.”</p><p>You keep asking people, “What is the time?” And they will look at
their watches and reply. But if you really ask, “What is time?” If you
ask for the definition, then watches won’t help.</p><p>Can you define time? Nobody has ever seen it, there is no way of
seeing it. If you look, it is gone; if you think, it is not there. When
you don’t think, when you don’t look, when you simply are, it is there.
You live it. And Saint Augustine is right: God can be lived, but cannot
be seen. Time also can be lived, but cannot be seen. Time is not a
philosophical problem, it is existential. God is also not philosophical,
he is existential. People have lived him, but if you insist on a
definition they will remain silent, they cannot answer. And if you can
be in this moment, the doors of all the mysteries are open.</p><p><br></p><p>So throw off all desires, remove all the dust from your eyes, be at
ease within, not longing for something, not even for God. Every longing
is the same, whether for a big car, or God, or a big house, makes no
difference. Longing is the same. Don’t long – just be. Don’t even look –
just be! Don’t think! Let this moment be there, and you in it, and
suddenly you have everything – because life is there. Suddenly
everything starts showering on you, and then this moment becomes eternal
and then there is no time. It is always the now. It never ends, never
begins. But then you are in it, not an outsider. You have entered the
whole, you have recognized who you are.</p><p>Now try to understand Chuang Tzu’s sutra about the need to win. From
where does this need arise –</p><p>the need to win? Everybody is seeking victory, seeking to win, but
why does this need to win arise?</p><p><br></p><p>You are not in any way aware that you are already victorious, that
life has happened to you. You are already a winner and nothing more is
possible, all that could happen has happened to you. You are already an
emperor, and there is no other kingdom to be won. But you have not
recognized it, you have not known the beauty of the life that has
already happened to you. You have not known the silence, the peace, the
bliss that is already there.</p><p>And because you are not aware of the inner kingdom, you always feel
that something more is needed, some victory, to prove that you are not a
beggar.</p><p><br></p><p>Once, Alexander the Great came to India – to win, of course. If you
don’t need to win you will not go anywhere. Why bother? Athens was so
beautiful, there was no need to bother to go on such a long journey.</p><p><br></p><p>On the way he heard that on a river bank lived a mystic, Diogenes. He
had heard many stories about him. In those days, in Athens particularly,
only two names were spoken about – one was Alexander, the other was
Diogenes. They were two opposites, two polarities. Alexander was an
emperor, trying to create a kingdom which stretched from one end of the
earth to the other. He wanted to possess the whole world; he was the
conqueror, the man in search of victory.</p><p>And Diogenes was exactly the opposite. He lived naked, not a single
thing did he possess. In the beginning he had a begging bowl for
drinking water, or sometimes to beg food. Then one day he saw a dog
drinking water from the river and immediately he threw away his bowl. He
said, “If dogs do without, why not I? Dogs are so intelligent that they
can do without a bowl. I must be very stupid to carry this bowl with me,
it is a burden.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took that dog for his master, and invited the dog to be with him
because he was so intelligent. The dog had shown him that his bowl was
an unnecessary burden – he was not aware. And from then on that dog
remained with him. They used to sleep together, to take their food
together. The dog was his only companion.</p><p><br></p><p>Someone asked Diogenes, “Why do you keep company with a dog?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “He is more intelligent than so-called human beings. I was
not so intelligent before I met him. Looking at him, watching him, has
made me more alert. He lives in the here and now, not bothered by
anything, not possessing anything. And he is so happy that having
nothing he has everything. I am not yet so content, some uneasiness
remains inside me. When I have become just like him, then I will have
reached the goal.”</p><p>Alexander had heard about Diogenes, his ecstatic bliss, his silent,
mirrorlike eyes, just like the blue sky without any clouds. And this man
lived naked, he did not even need clothes. Then somebody said, “He lives
nearby on the river bank, and we are passing, we are not very far
away<span class=s5></span>” Alexander</p><p>wanted to see him, so he went.</p><p><br></p><p>It was morning, a winter morning, and Diogenes was taking his
sunbath, lying on the sand naked, enjoying the morning, the sun
showering on him, everything so beautiful, silent, the river flowing
by.…</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander wondered what to say. A man like Alexander cannot think
except about things and possessions. So he looked at Diogenes, and said,
“I am Alexander the Great. If you need something, tell me. I can be of
much help and I would like to help you.”</p><p>Diogenes laughed, and said, “I don’t need anything. Just stand a
little to the side, you are blocking my sun. That’s all you can do for
me. Remember, don’t block anybody’s sun, that is all you can do. Don’t
stand in my way, and you need do nothing else.”</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander looked at this man. He must have felt like a beggar before
him: He needs nothing, and I need the whole world, and even then I will
not be satisfied, even this world is not enough. Said Alexander, “It
makes me happy to see you, I have never seen such a contented man.”</p><p><br></p><p>Diogenes said, “There is no problem! If you want to be as contented
as I, come and lie down by my side, have a sunbath. Forget the future,
and drop the past. Nobody is hindering you.”</p><p>Alexander laughed, a superficial laugh of course, and said, “You are
right – but the time is not yet</p><p>ripe. One day I would like to relax like you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Diogenes replied, “Then that one day will never come. What else do
you need to relax? If I, a beggar, can relax, what else is needed? Why
this struggle, this effort, these wars, this conquering, why this need
to win?”</p><p><br></p><p>Said Alexander, “When I have become victorious, when I have conquered
the whole world, I will come and learn from you and sit by your side
here on this bank.”</p><p>Diogenes said, “But if I can lie here and relax right now, why wait
for the future? And why go around the whole world creating misery for
yourself and others? Why wait until the end of your life to come to me
and relax here? I am already relaxing.”</p><p><br></p><p>What is the need to win? You have to prove yourself. You feel so
inferior within, you feel so vacant and empty, you feel such a
nobodiness inside, that the need to prove arises. You have to prove that
you are somebody, and unless you have proved it, how can you be at
ease?</p><p>There are two ways, and try to understand that these are the only
ways. One way is to go out and prove that you are somebody; the other
way is to go in and realize that you are nobody. If you go outwards you
will never be able to prove that you are somebody. The need will remain;
rather, it may increase. The more you prove, the more of a beggar you
will feel, like Alexander standing before Diogenes. Proving to others
that you are somebody does not make you become somebody. Deep down the
nobodiness remains. It bites at the heart, and there you know that you
are nobody.</p><p><br></p><p>Kingdoms won’t help, because kingdoms will not go in and fill the gap
inside you. Nothing can go in. The without will remain without; the
within will remain within. There is no meeting. You may have all the
wealth in the world but how can you bring it in and fill the emptiness?
No, even when you have all the wealth you will still feel empty – more
empty, because now the contrast will be there. That is why a Buddha
leaves his palace: seeing all the wealth yet feeling the inner
emptiness, he feels that all is useless.</p><p><br></p><p>Another way is to go within – not to try to get rid of this
nobodiness, but to realize it. This is what Chuang Tzu is saying: Become
an empty boat, just go in and realize that you are nobody. The moment
you realize that you are nobody you explode into a new dimension,
because when one person realizes he is nobody he is also realizing that
he is all.</p><p>You are not somebody, because you are all. How can the all be
somebody? Somebody is always a part. God cannot be somebody because he
is all, he cannot possess anything because he is the whole. Only beggars
possess, because possessions have limitations, they cannot become
unlimited. Somebodiness has a boundary, somebodiness cannot be without
boundaries, it cannot be infinite. Nobodiness is infinite, just like
allness.</p><p>Really, both ways are the same. If you are moving without you will
feel your inner being as nobody. If you are moving within you will feel
the same nobodiness as all. That is why Buddha says that SHUNYA, the
absolute void, is Brahman. To be nobody is to realize that you are all.
To realize that you are somebody is to realize that you are not all. And
nothing less will do.</p><p>So the other way is to move within, not to fight with this
nobodiness, not to try to fill this emptiness, but to realize it and
become one with it. Be the empty boat and then all the seas are yours.
Then you can move into the uncharted, then there is no hindrance for
this boat, nobody can block its path. No maps are needed. This boat will
move into the infinite and now everywhere is the goal. But one has to
move within.</p><p>The need to win is to prove that you are somebody, and the only way
we know how to prove is to prove in the eyes of others, because their
eyes become reflections.</p><p>Looking in others’ eyes Alexander could see that he was somebody;
standing near Diogenes, he felt he was nobody. Diogenes would not
recognize external greatness. Before him, Alexander must have felt
foolish. It is said that he told Diogenes that if God would grant him
another birth he would like to be Diogenes rather than Alexander – next
time!</p><p>The mind always moves to the future! This very time he could become
Diogenes, there was no barrier, nobody was preventing him. There will be
millions of barriers to becoming Alexander the Great because everybody
will try to prevent you. When you want to prove that you are somebody
you hurt everyone’s ego, and they will all try to prove that you are
nothing. What, who, do you think you are? You have to prove it, and it
is a very hard way, very violent, very destructive.</p><p>There is no barrier to being a Diogenes. Alexander felt the beauty,
the grace of this man. He said, “If</p><p>God gives me another birth I would like to be Diogenes – but next
time.”</p><p>Diogenes laughed and said, “If I am asked, only one thing is certain:
I would not like ever to be</p><p>Alexander the Great!”</p><p>In the eye of Diogenes, Alexander could have seen no recognition of
his victories. Suddenly he must have felt the sinking sensation, the
deathlike sensation that he was nobody. He must have escaped, run from
Diogenes as soon as possible. He was a dangerous man.</p><p>It is said that Diogenes haunted Alexander his whole life. Wherever
he went, Diogenes was with him like a shadow. At night, in dreams,
Diogenes was there laughing. And a beautiful story tells that they died
on the same day.</p><p><br></p><p>They died on the same day, but Diogenes must have waited a little so
that he could follow Alexander. While crossing the river which divides
this world from that, Alexander met Diogenes again, and this second
encounter was more dangerous than before. Alexander was in front because
he had died a few minutes earlier – Diogenes had been waiting to follow
him. Alexander, hearing the sound of someone behind him in the river,
looked back and saw Diogenes there laughing. He must have become quite
dumbstruck, because this time things were absolutely different. He was
also naked like Diogenes, because you cannot take your clothes to the
other world. This time he was absolutely nobody, no emperor.</p><p>But Diogenes was the same. All that death can take away he had
already renounced, so death couldn’t take anything from him. He was just
the same as on that river bank; here he was in this river, just the same
as before.</p><p><br></p><p>So to be nonchalant, to give himself courage and confidence,
Alexander also laughed and said,</p><p>“Great, wonderful! Again the meeting of the greatest emperor and the
greatest beggar.”</p><p><br></p><p>Diogenes replied, “You are absolutely right, only you are a little
confused about who is the emperor and who is the beggar. This is a
meeting of the greatest emperor and the greatest beggar, but the emperor
is behind and the beggar is in front. And I tell you, Alexander, it was
the same at our first meeting. You were the beggar, but you thought I
was. Now look at yourself! What have you gained by winning the whole
world?”</p><p><br></p><p>What is the need to win? What do you want to prove? In your own eyes
you know that you are a nonentity, you are nothing, and this nothingness
becomes a pain in the heart. You suffer because you are nothing – so you
have to prove yourself in the eyes of others. You have to create an
opinion in others’ minds that you are somebody, that you are not a
nothing. And looking in their eyes you will gather opinions, public
opinion, and through public opinion you will create an image. This image
is the ego, it is not your real self. It is a reflected glory, not your
own – it is collected from others’ eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>A man like Alexander will always be afraid of others because they can
take back whatsoever they have given. A politician is always afraid of
the public because they can take back whatsoever they have given. His
self is just a borrowed self. If you are afraid of others, you are a
slave, you are not a master.</p><p><br></p><p>A Diogenes is not afraid of others. You cannot take anything from him
because he has not borrowed anything. He has the self, you have only the
ego. This is the difference between the self and the ego – the ego is a
borrowed self.</p><p>Ego depends on others, on public opinion; self is your authentic
being. It is not borrowed, it is yours. Nobody can take it back.</p><p>Look, Chuang Tzu has beautiful lines to say: WHEN AN ARCHER IS
SHOOTING FOR FUN</p><p><br></p><p>HE HAS ALL HIS SKILL – FOR FUN!</p><p>WHEN AN ARCHER IS SHOOTING FOR FUN</p><p><br></p><p>HE HAS ALL HIS SKILL.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are playing, you are not trying to prove that you are
somebody. You are at ease, at home. While playing, just for fun, you are
not worried what others think about you.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you seen a father in a mock fight with his child? He will be
defeated. He will lie down and the child will sit on his chest and
laugh, and say, “I am the winner!” – and the father will be happy. It is
just fun. In fun you can be defeated and be happy. Fun isn’t serious, it
is not related to the ego. Ego is always serious.</p><p><br></p><p>So remember, if you are serious, you will always be in turmoil, inner
turmoil. A saint is always in play, as if shooting for the fun of it. He
is not interested in shooting at a particular target, he is just
enjoying himself.</p><p><br></p><p>A German philosopher, Eugene Herrigel, went to Japan to learn
meditation. And in Japan they use all types of excuses to teach
meditation – archery is one of them. Herrigel was a perfect archer; he
was one hundred percent accurate, he never missed the mark. So he went
to a master to learn meditation through archery, because he was already
skilled in it.</p><p>Three years of study passed and Herrigel started feeling that it was
a waste of time. The master went on insisting that HE should not shoot.
He told Herrigel, “Let the arrow leave by itself. You should not be
there when you aim, let the arrow aim itself.”</p><p><br></p><p>This was absurd. For a Western man particularly, it was absolutely
absurd: What do you mean, let the arrow shoot itself? How can the arrow
shoot itself? I have to do something. And he continued shooting, never
missing the target.</p><p>But the master said, “The target is not the target at all. YOU are
the target. I am not looking at whether you hit the target or not. That
is a mechanical skill. I am looking at you, to see whether you are there
or not. Shoot for fun! Enjoy it, don’t try to prove that you never miss
the target. Don’t try to prove the ego. It is already there, you are
there, there is no need to prove it. Be at ease and allow the arrow to
shoot itself.”</p><p><br></p><p>Herrigel could not understand. He tried and tried and said again and
again, “If my aim is a hundred percent accurate, why don’t you give me
the certificate?”</p><p><br></p><p>The Western mind is always interested in the end result and the East
is always interested in the beginning, not in the end. To the Eastern
mind the end is useless; the importance is in the beginning, in the
archer, not in the target. So the master said, “No!”</p><p><br></p><p>Then, completely disappointed, Herrigel asked permission to leave. He
said, “Then I will have to go.</p><p>Three years is so long and nothing has been gained. You go on saying
no...that I am still the same.”</p><p><br></p><p>The day he was to leave he went to say goodbye to the master and
found him teaching other disciples. This morning Herrigel was not
interested; he was leaving, he had dropped the whole project. So he was
just waiting there for the master to finish so that he could say his
goodbye and leave.</p><p><br></p><p>Sitting on a bench he looked at the master for the first time. For
the first time in three years he looked at the master. Really, he was
not doing anything; it was as if the arrow was shooting itself. The
master was not serious, he was playing, he was in fun. There was nobody
who was interested in hitting the target.</p><p>Ego is always target-oriented. Fun has no target to reach, fun is in
the beginning when the arrow leaves the bow. If it shoots that is
accidental, if it reaches the target that is not relevant; whether it
reaches or misses is not the point. But when the arrow leaves the bow,
the archer should be in fun, enjoying, not serious. When you are serious
you are tense, when you are not serious you are relaxed, and when you
are relaxed you are. When you are tense, the ego is; YOU are
clouded.</p><p>For the first time Herrigel looked...because now he was not
interested. It was none of his business now, he had dropped the whole
thing. He was leaving so there was no question of seriousness. He had
accepted his failure, there was nothing to be proved. He looked, and for
the first time his eyes were not obsessed with the target.</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at the master and it was as if the arrow was shooting
itself from the bow. The master was only giving it energy, he was not
shooting. He was not doing anything, the whole thing was effortless.
Herrigel looked, and for the first time he understood.</p><p><br></p><p>As if enchanted he approached the master, took the bow in his hand
and drew back the arrow. The master said, “You have reached. This is
what I have been telling you to do for three years.” The arrow had not
yet left the bow and the master said, “Finished. The target is
attained.” Now he was having fun, he was not serious, he was not
goaloriented.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the difference. Fun is not goal-oriented; it has no goal. Fun
itself is the goal, the intrinsic value, nothing exists outside it. You
enjoy it, that is all. There is no purpose to it, you play with it, that
is all.</p><p>WHEN AN ARCHER IS SHOOTING FOR FUN HE HAS ALL HIS SKILL.</p><p>When you are shooting for fun, you are not in conflict. There are not
two, there is no tension; your mind is not going anywhere. Your mind is
not going at all – so you are whole. Then the skill is there.</p><p><br></p><p>A story is told about a Zen master, a painter, who was designing a
new temple, a pagoda. It was his habit to have his chief disciple by his
side. He used to draw the design, look at the disciple and ask, “What do
you think?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the disciple would say, “Not worthy of you.” So he would discard
it.</p><p>This happened ninety-nine times. Three months passed and the king
kept asking when the design would be completed so the building could
start. And then one day it happened that while the master was drawing
the design the ink ran dry, so he told the disciple to go out and
prepare more ink.</p><p><br></p><p>The disciple went out, and when he returned he looked and said,
“What? You have done it! But why couldn’t you do it in these three
months?”</p><p><br></p><p>The master said, “It is because of you. You were sitting by my side
and I was divided. You were looking at me and I was target-oriented, it
was not fun. When you were not there, I relaxed. I felt that nobody was
looking and I became whole. This design I have not done, it has come by
itself. For three months it would not come because I was the doer.”</p><p>WHEN AN ARCHER IS SHOOTING FOR FUN HE HAS ALL HIS SKILL.</p><p>...Because his whole being is available. And when the whole being is
available, you have a beauty, a grace, a totally different quality of
being. When you are divided, serious, tense, you are ugly. You may
succeed, but your success will be ugly. You may prove that you are
somebody but you are not proving anything, you are simply creating a
false image. But when you are total, relaxed, whole, nobody may know
about you, but you are.</p><p><br></p><p>And this wholeness is the benediction, the beatitude, the blessing,
that happens to a meditative mind, that happens in meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation means wholeness.</p><p><br></p><p>So remember, meditation should be fun, it should not be like work.
You should not do it like a religious man, you should do it like a
gambler. Play, do it for fun, like a sportsman not a businessman! It
should be fun, and then all the skill will be available, then it will
flower by itself. You will not be needed. No effort is needed. Simply
your whole being has to be available, your whole energy has to be
available. Then the flower comes by itself.</p><p>IF HE SHOOTS FOR A BRASS BUCKLE HE IS ALREADY NERVOUS.</p><p>If he is in a competition just for a brass buckle, if something is to
be achieved, some result, he is already nervous, afraid. Fear comes in:
“Will I succeed or not?” He is divided. One part of the mind says,
“Maybe you will succeed”; another part says, “Maybe you will fail.” Now
the whole of his skill is not available, now he is half and half. And
whenever you are divided your whole being becomes ugly and ill. You are
diseased.</p><p>IF HE SHOOTS FOR A PRIZE OF GOLD HE GOES BLIND</p><p>OR SEES TWO TARGETS –</p><p><br></p><p>HE IS OUT OF HIS MIND.</p><p><br></p><p>Go to the market and see people who are after gold. They are blind.
Gold blinds men as nothing else does, gold covers the eyes completely.
When you are too anxious for success, too anxious for the result, too
ambitious, when you are too anxious for the gold medal, then you are
blind and you start seeing two targets. You are so drunk you start
seeing double.</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin was talking to his son in a bar. He said, “Always remember
when to stop drinking. Alcohol is good, but one needs to know when to
stop. And I’m telling you through my experience. Look over at that
corner – when those four people sitting at the table start looking like
eight, stop.”</p><p>The boy said, “But father, I see only two people sitting there.”</p><p><br></p><p>When the mind is drunken, vision becomes double. And gold makes you
unconscious, drunk. Now there are two targets and you are in such a
hurry to reach them that you are nervous, trembling inside.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the state Chuang Tzu means when he says:</p><p><br></p><p>...HE IS OUT OF HIS MIND.</p><p>Everybody is out of his mind. It is not only mad people who are out
of their minds, you are also out of your mind. The difference is only of
degree, not of quality, a little more and any moment you can cross the
boundary. It is as if you are at ninety-nine degrees. One hundred
degrees and you boil, you have crossed over. The difference between
those who are in madhouses and those who are outside is only of
quantity, not of quality. Everyone is out of his mind, because everyone
is after results, goals, purposes. Something has to be achieved. Then
comes nervousness, inner trembling, then you cannot be still within. And
when you tremble inside, the target becomes two, or even four or eight –
and then it is impossible to become an archer.</p><p><br></p><p>A perfect archer is always the archer who is having fun. A perfect
man lives life as fun, as play.</p><p>Look at Krishna’s life. Had Chuang Tzu known about him, it would have
been beautiful. Krishna’s life is fun. Buddha, Mahavira, Jesus, somehow
or other look a little serious, as if something has to be achieved – the
moksha, the nirvana, the desirelessness. But Krishna is absolutely
purposeless: the flute player just living for fun, dancing with girls
and enjoying, singing. For him there is nowhere to go. Everything is
here, so why bother about the result? Everything is available right now,
why not enjoy it?</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna is the perfect man if fun is the sign of a perfect man. In
India we never call Krishna’s life CHARITRA, his character, we call it
Krishna’s LEELA, his play. It is not a character, it is not purposeful;
it is absolutely purposeless.</p><p>It is just like a small child. You cannot ask, “What are you doing?”
You cannot ask, “What is the meaning of it?” He is enjoying himself just
running after butterflies. What will he achieve just jumping in the sun?
Where will this effort lead him? Nowhere! He is not going anywhere. We
call him childish and we think ourselves mature, but I tell you that
when you are really mature, you will again become childlike. Then your
life will again become fun. You will enjoy it, every bit of it, you will
not be serious. A deep laughter will spread all over your life. It will
be more like a dance and less like a business; it will be more like
singing, humming in the bathroom, less like calculating in the office.
It will not be mathematics, it will just be enjoyment.</p><p><br></p><p>HIS SKILL HAS NOT CHANGED,</p><p><br></p><p>BUT THE PRIZE DIVIDES HIM.</p><p><br></p><p>HE CARES.</p><p><br></p><p>HE THINKS MORE OF WINNING THAN OF SHOOTING –</p><p>AND THE NEED TO WIN DRAINS HIM OF POWER.</p><p>If you feel so impotent, so powerless, helpless, it is because of
YOU. Nobody else is draining you of your power. You have infinite
sources of power, never ending, but you look drained, as if any moment
you are going to fall with no energy left.</p><p><br></p><p>Where is all the energy going? You are creating a conflict within
yourself although your skill is the same.</p><p>HIS SKILL HAS NOT CHANGED, BUT THE PRIZE DIVIDES HIM. HE CARES.</p><p>I have heard a story. It happened in a village that a poor boy, the
son of a beggar, was young and healthy. He was so young and so healthy
that when the king’s elephant passed through the village, he would just
catch hold of the elephant’s tail and it would not be able to move!</p><p>Sometimes it became very embarrassing to the king because he would be
sitting on the elephant and the whole market would gather and people
would laugh. And all because of the son of a beggar!</p><p><br></p><p>The king called his prime minister, “Something has to be done. This
is insulting. I have become afraid to go through that village, and the
boy sometimes comes to other villages also! Anywhere, anytime, he can
catch hold of the elephant’s tail and it will not move. That boy is
powerful, so do something to drain his energy.”</p><p><br></p><p>The prime minister said, “I will have to go and consult a wise man
because I don’t know how to drain his energy. He is just a beggar. If he
had a shop, that would drain his energy. If he was working as a clerk in
an office, that would drain his energy. If he was a master in a primary
school, then his energy could be drained. But he has nothing to do. He
lives for fun, and people love him and feed him so he is never short of
food. He is happy, he eats and sleeps. So it is difficult, but I will
go.”</p><p>So he went to a wise old man. The wise old man said, “Do one thing.
Go and tell the boy that you will give him one golden rupee every day if
he will do a small job – and the job is really small. He has to go to
the village temple and put the lamp on. He has just to light the lamp at
dusk, that is all. And you will give him one golden rupee every
day.”</p><p><br></p><p>The prime minister said, “But how will this help? This may make him
even more energetic. He will get</p><p>one rupee and he will eat more. He will not even bother to beg.” The
wise man said, “Don’t worry, simply do as I say.”</p><p>This was done, and the next week, when again the king passed, the boy
tried to stop the elephant but he failed. He was dragged along by
it.</p><p>What happened? Care entered, anxiety entered. He had to remember, for
twenty-four hours a day he had to remember that he had to go to the
temple every evening and put the light on. That became an anxiety that
divided his whole being. Even in his sleep he started to dream that it
was evening: What are you doing? Go and switch on the light and get your
one rupee. And then he started to collect those golden rupees. He had
seven, now eight, and then he started to calculate that within so much
time he would have one hundred golden rupees – and then they would grow
to two hundred. Mathematics came in and the fun was lost. And it was
only a small thing that he had to do, to put the light on. Just the work
of a single minute, not even that, just a momentary thing. But it became
a worry. It drained him of all his energy.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you are drained it is no wonder your life is not fun. You have
so many temples and so many lamps to put on and off, so many
calculations to make in your life, it cannot be a fun.</p><p>The archer’s skill has not changed, the skill is the same, but the
archer, when he is shooting for fun, has all his skill available. Now
although his skill has not changed, the prize divides him. He cares,
anxiety enters, nervousness comes in. He thinks more of winning, now he
is not concerned with shooting. Now the question is how to win, not how
to shoot. He has moved from the beginning to the end. Now the means is
not important, the end is important, and whenever the end is important
your energy is divided, because all that can be done is to be done with
the means, not the end. Ends are not in your hands.</p><p><br></p><p>Says Krishna in the Gita to Arjuna: “Don’t be concerned with the end,
with the result. Simply do whatsoever is to be done here and now and
leave the result to me, to God. Don’t ask what will happen, nobody
knows. Be concerned with the means and don’t think of the end. Don’t be
result- oriented.”</p><p><br></p><p>This situation is beautiful and worth linking with Chuang Tzu’s
sentences, because Arjuna was an</p><p>archer, the greatest India has produced. He was the perfect
archer.</p><p><br></p><p>But the end entered his mind. He had never worried, it had never
happened before. His archery was perfect, his skill was total, absolute,
but looking at the battlefield of Kurukshetra, at the two armies
confronting each other, he became worried. What was his worry? It was
that he had friends on both sides. It was a family affair, a war between
cousins, so everybody was interlinked, on both sides were relatives. All
the families were divided – it was a rare war, a family war.</p><p>Krishna and Arjuna were on one side and Krishna’s army was fighting
on the other side. Krishna had said, “You both love me so you will have
to divide half and half. One side can have me, and the other side can
have my armies.”</p><p><br></p><p>Duryodhana, the leader of the other side, was foolish. He thought,
“What will I do with Krishna on his own? But he has a big army<span class=s5></span>” And he chose Krishna’s army.</p><p>So Krishna was with Arjuna and Arjuna was happy, because one Krishna
is more than all the world. What can armies do – unconscious, sleepy
people? One awakened man is worth all.</p><p>Krishna became the real help when Arjuna was confused and his mind
divided. In the Gita it is said that looking at these two armies he
became puzzled. And these are the words he used to Krishna: “My energy
is drained. I feel nervous, I feel impotent, my power has left me.” And
he was a man of perfect skill, a perfect archer.</p><p><br></p><p>His bow was called a GANDIVA. He said, “The gandiva feels too heavy
for me. I have become so powerless, my body is numb, and I cannot think
and cannot see. Everything has become confused, because these are all
relatives and I will have to kill them. What will be the result? Murder,
so many people killed, what will I gain out of it? A worthless kingdom?
So I am not interested in fighting, it seems too high a price to pay. I
would like to escape and become a sannyasin, to go to the forest and
meditate. This is not for me. My energy is drained.”</p><p>Krishna told him, “Don’t think of the result. It is not in your
hands. And don’t think of yourself as the doer, because if you are the
doer then the end is in your hands. The doer is always the divine, and
you are just an instrument. Be concerned with the here and now, the
means, and leave the end to me. I tell you, Arjuna, that these people
are already dead, they are fated to die. You are not going to murder
them. You are just the instrument which will reveal to them the fact
that they have already been murdered. As far as I can see, I see them
dead. They have reached the point where death happens – you are just an
instrument.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sanskrit has a beautiful word, there is no equivalent to it in
English: it is NIMITTA. Nimitta means you are not the doer, you are not
the cause, not even one of the causes, you are just the nimitta. It
means the cause is in the hands of the divine. The divine is the doer,
you are just a vehicle of it. You are just like a postman – the postman
is the nimitta. He comes and delivers a letter to you. If the letter
insults you, you don’t get angry with him. You don’t say, “Why did you
bring me this letter?” The postman is not concerned, he is the nimitta.
He has not written the letter, he has not caused it, he is not concerned
at all. He has just fulfilled his duty. You will not be angry with him.
You will not say, “Why did you bring this letter to me?”</p><p>Krishna said to Arjuna, “You are just like a postman, you have to
deliver death to them. You are not the killer; death is from the divine.
They have earned it already, so don’t you worry. If you do not kill them
then somebody else will deliver the letter. If this postman will not do
it then someone else will. If you are away or on holiday or are ill it
doesn’t mean that the letter will not be delivered. A substitute postman
will do. But the letter has to be delivered. So don’t you be bothered,
don’t get worried unnecessarily; you are just a nimitta, neither the
cause of it nor the doer of it, just an instrument. Be concerned with
the means, don’t think about the ends, because once you think about the
ends your skill is lost.</p><p>“You are divided and that is why you are feeling drained, Arjuna.
Your energy has not gone anywhere, it has become a conflict – within,
you are divided. You are fighting with yourself. One part says go ahead,
another part says this is not good. Your wholeness is lost. And whenever
the wholeness is lost, one feels impotent.”</p><p><br></p><p>Such a powerful man as Arjuna can say, “I cannot carry this gandiva,
this bow is too heavy for me. I</p><p>have become nervous. I feel a deep fear, an anxiety arising in me. I
cannot fight.”</p><p><br></p><p>The skill is the same, nothing has changed, but the mind is divided.
Whenever you are divided you are powerless; when you are undivided you
are powerful. Desires divide you, meditation undivides you: desires lead
you to the future, meditation brings you to the present.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember this as a conclusion: don’t move to the future. Whenever you
feel your mind moving to the future jump back to the present
immediately. Don’t try to complete it. Immediately, the moment you
think, the moment you become aware that the mind has moved into the
future, into the desire, jump back to the present. Be at home.</p><p><br></p><p>You will lose the present. Again and again you will miss it because
it has become a long habit; but sooner or later, more and more, you can
be at home. Then life is fun, it is a play. And then you are so full of
energy that you overflow, a flood of vitality. And that flood is
bliss.</p><p>Impotent, drained, you cannot be ecstatic. How can you dance? For
dancing you will need infinite energy. Drained, how can you sing?
Singing is always an overflowing. Dead as you are, how can you pray?
Only when you are totally alive, a thankfulness arises from the heart, a
gratitude. That gratitude is prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>Enough for today.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s3>7</span></p><p><br></p><p>Three Friends</p><p><br></p><p>16 July 1974 am in Buddha Hall</p><p><br></p><p>THERE WERE THREE FRIENDS DISCUSSING LIFE. ONE SAID:</p><p>“CAN MEN LIVE TOGETHER AND KNOW NOTHING OF IT,</p><p><br></p><p>WORK TOGETHER AND PRODUCE NOTHING? CAN THEY FLY AROUND IN SPACE</p><p>AND FORGET TO EXIST, WORLD WITHOUT END?”</p><p><br></p><p>THE THREE FRIENDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND BURST OUT LAUGHING.</p><p>THEY HAD NO EXPLANATION,</p><p><br></p><p>THUS THEY WERE BETTER FRIENDS THAN BEFORE. THEN ONE FRIEND DIED.
CONFUCIUS SENT A DISCIPLE</p><p>TO HELP THE OTHER TWO CHANT HIS OBSEQUIES.</p><p><br></p><p>THE DISCIPLE FOUND</p><p><br></p><p>THAT ONE FRIEND HAD COMPOSED A SONG WHILE THE OTHER PLAYED THE LUTE.
THEY SANG:</p><p>“HEY, SUNG HU, WHERE’D YOU GO? HEY, SUNG HU, WHERE’D YOU GO?</p><p>YOU HAVE GONE WHERE YOU REALLY WERE, AND WE ARE HERE – DAMN IT, WE
ARE HERE!” THEN THE DISCIPLE OF CONFUCIUS</p><p>BURST IN ON THEM AND EXCLAIMED:</p><p><br></p><p>“MAY I INQUIRE WHERE YOU FOUND THIS</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE RUBRICS FOR OBSEQUIES, THIS FRIVOLOUS CAROLING</p><p>IN THE PRESENCE OF THE DEPARTED?”</p><p><br></p><p>THE TWO FRIENDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND LAUGHED:</p><p>“POOR FELLOW,</p><p><br></p><p>HE DOESN’T KNOW THE NEW LITURGY!”</p><p>The first thing about life is that it has no explanation. It is there
in its absolute glory, but it has no explanation. It is there as a
mystery and if you try to explain it you will miss it. It will not be
explained, but you will become blind through your explanations.</p><p><br></p><p>Philosophy is the enemy of life. The most inimical thing that can
happen to a man is to get fixed and obsessed with explanations. The
moment you think you have the explanation life has left you, you are
already dead.</p><p><br></p><p>This seems to be a paradox. Death may be explained, but life cannot
be explained – because death is something finished, complete, and life
is always an ongoing affair; life is always on the journey, death has
arrived already. When something has reached and is finished, you can
explain it, you can define it. When something is still ongoing, it means
that the unknown is still to be traveled.</p><p><br></p><p>You can know the past but you cannot know the future. You can put the
past into a theory, but how can you put the future into a theory? The
future is always an opening, an infinite opening, and it goes on opening
and opening. So when you explain, the explanation always indicates that
which is dead.</p><p>Philosophy has explanations so it cannot be very alive, and you
cannot find people who are more dead than philosophers. Life has ebbed
out, life has oozed out of them. They are shrunken heads, like dead
stones. They make much noise but there is no music of life. They have
many explanations, but they have completely forgotten that they have
only explanations in their hands,</p><p><br></p><p>Explanation is like a closed fist. Life is like an open hand. They
are totally different. And when the fist is completely closed there is
no sky in it, no air in it, no space to breathe. You cannot grab the sky
in your closed fist. The fist will miss it. The sky is there, the hand
is open, it is available. Explanation is grabbing, closing, defining –
life oozes out.</p><p><br></p><p>Even a laugh is greater than any philosophy, and when someone laughs
about life he understands it. So all those who have really known have
laughed. And their laughter can be heard even after centuries. Seeing
Buddha holding a flower in his hand, Mahakashyapa laughed. His laughter
can be heard even now. Those who have ears to hear, they will hear his
laughter, just like a river flowing down through the centuries
continuously.</p><p><br></p><p>In Zen monasteries in Japan, disciples still ask the master, “Tell
us, Master, why did Mahakashyapa laugh?” And those who are more alert
say, “Tell us, Master, why is Mahakashyapa still laughing?” They use the
present, not the past tense. And it is said that the master will reply
only when he feels that you can hear the laughter of Mahakashyapa. If
you cannot hear it, nothing can be said to you about it.</p><p>Buddhas have always been laughing. You may not have heard them
because your doors are closed. You may have looked at a buddha and you
may have felt that he is serious, but this seriousness is projected. It
is your own seriousness – you have used the buddha as a screen. Hence,
Christians say Jesus never laughed. This seems absolutely foolish. Jesus
must have laughed and he must have laughed so totally that his whole
being must have become laughter – but the disciples couldn’t hear it,
that is true. They must have remained closed, their own seriousness
projected.</p><p><br></p><p>They could see Jesus on the cross because you all live in such
suffering that you can only see suffering. If they had heard Jesus
laughing, they would have omitted it. It is so contradictory to their
life, it doesn’t fit in. A Jesus laughing doesn’t fit in with you, he
becomes a stranger.</p><p><br></p><p>But in the East it has been different, and in Zen, in Tao, the
laughter reached its peak. It became the polar opposite of
philosophy.</p><p><br></p><p>A philosopher is serious because he thinks life is a riddle and a
solution can be found. He works on life with his mind, and he gets more
and more serious. The more he misses life, the more he gets serious and
dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Taoists, Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu, say that if you can laugh, if you
can feel belly laughter that comes from the very core of your being,
that is not just painted on the surface, if you can feel laughter
that</p><p><br></p><p>comes from the deepest center of your being, spreads all over you,
overflows to the universe, that laughter will give you the first glimpse
of what life is. It is a mystery.</p><p>In Chuang Tzu such laughter is prayerful, because now you accept
life, you don’t hanker for the explanation. How can one find the
explanation? We are part of it. How can the part find the explanation
for the whole? How can the part look at the whole? How can the part
dissect, divide the whole? How can the part go before the whole?</p><p>Explanation means that you must transcend that which you are trying
to explain – you must be there before it existed, you must be there when
it has ceased to exist. You must move around it so you can define it,
and you must dissect so you can reach the heart. A surgeon can find the
explanation, not for life, but for a dead body. All medical definitions
of life are foolish because the surgeon dissects, and when he makes a
conclusion life is there no longer, it is only a corpse. All
explanations are postmortems, life is not there.</p><p>Now even scientists have become aware of the phenomenon that when you
examine human blood, the blood cannot be the same as it was when it was
moving in the veins of the living person. Then it was alive, it had a
different quality; now when it is in the test tube, it is dead. It is
not the same blood, because the basic quality – life – is no longer in
it. All explanations are of that type.</p><p>A flower on the tree is different because life, the shape of life, is
flowing in it. When you cut it from the tree, take it to the lab,
examine it, it is a different flower. Don’t be deceived by the
appearance of it. Now life is no longer flowing in it. You may come to
know the chemical composition of the flower, but that is not the
explanation.</p><p>A poet has a different approach, not through dissection, but through
love, not through uprooting the flower from the tree but rather through
merging with the flower, being with it in deep love, in a participation
mystique. He participates with it, then he comes to know something, and
that is not an explanation. Poetry cannot be an explanation, but it has
a glimpse of the truth. It is truer than any science.</p><p>Watch: when you are in love with someone your heart beats
differently. Your lover, your beloved, will listen to your heart: it
beats differently. Your lover will take your hand...the warmth is
different. The blood moves in a different dance, it pulsates
differently.</p><p>When the doctor takes your hand in his hand, the pulsation is not the
same. He can hear the heart beating but this beat is different. When the
heart was beating for a lover it had a song of its own, but only a lover
can know the beat, only the lover can know the pulsation, the blood, the
warmth of life. The doctor cannot know.</p><p>What has changed? The doctor has become the observer and you are the
observed – you are not one. The doctor treats you like an object. He
looks at you as if he is looking at a thing – that makes the difference.
A lover doesn’t look at you as an object – he becomes one with you, he
merges and melts. He comes to know the deeper core of your being, but he
has no explanation. He feels it, but feeling is different. He cannot
think about it.</p><p>Anything that can be thought will not be alive. Thought deals with
death, it always deals with dead objects; that is why in science there
is no place for feeling. Feeling gives a different dimension to
existence, the dimension of the alive.</p><p><br></p><p>This beautiful story has many things to say to you. Move step by step
into it, and if you reach a conclusion, then understand that you have
missed it. If you reach laughter, then you have understood.</p><p>THERE WERE THREE FRIENDS DISCUSSING LIFE.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu is very telegraphic. As always, those who know will not
utter a single word unnecessarily. They live with the essential.</p><p><br></p><p>THERE WERE THREE FRIENDS DISCUSSING LIFE.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing to be understood is that only friends can discuss
life. Whenever a discussion becomes antagonistic, whenever a discussion
becomes a debate, the dialogue is broken. Life cannot be discussed that
way. Only friends can discuss, because then discussion is not a debate,
it is a dialogue.</p><p><br></p><p>And what is the difference between a debate and a dialogue? In debate
you are not ready to listen to the other; even if you are listening,
your listening is false. You are not really listening, you are simply
preparing your argument. While the other is speaking you are getting
ready to contradict. While the other is talking, you are simply waiting
for your opportunity to argue back. You have a prejudice already there
in you, you have a theory. You are not in search, you are not ignorant,
you are not innocent; you are already filled, your boat is not empty.
You carry certain theories with you and you are trying to prove them
true.</p><p><br></p><p>A seeker of truth carries no theories with him. He is always open,
vulnerable. He can listen. A Hindu cannot listen, a Mohammedan cannot
listen. How can a Hindu listen? He already knows the truth, there is no
need to listen. You try to make him listen but he cannot; his mind is
already so filled that nothing can penetrate. A Christian cannot listen,
he already knows the truth. He has closed his doors to new breezes, he
has closed his eyes for the new sun to rise, he has reached, he has
arrived.</p><p>All those who feel that they have arrived can debate, but they cannot
move in a dialogue. They can only clash. Then conflict arises and they
oppose each other. In such a discussion you may prove something, but
nothing is proved. You may silence the other, but the other is never
converted. You cannot convince, because this is a sort of war, a
civilized war – you are not fighting with weapons, you are fighting with
words.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu says: Three friends were discussing life – that is why
they could reach laughter; otherwise there would have been a conclusion.
One theory might have defeated other theories, one philosophy might have
silenced other philosophies, then there would have been a conclusion –
and conclusion is dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Life has no conclusion. Life has no foolish thought to it. It goes on
and on endlessly; it is always, eternally, an onward affair. How can you
conclude anything about it? The moment you conclude you have stepped out
of it. Life goes on and you have stepped out of the way. You may cling
to your conclusion but life will not wait for you.</p><p><br></p><p>Friends can discuss. Why? You can love a person, you cannot love a
philosophy. Philosophers cannot be friends. You can be either their
disciple or their enemy but you cannot be their friend. Either you are
convinced by them or not convinced, either you follow them or don’t
follow them, but you cannot be friends. A friendship is possible only
between two empty boats. Then you are open to the other, inviting to the
other, then you are constantly an invitation, come to me, enter me, be
with me.</p><p><br></p><p>You can throw away theories and philosophies but you cannot throw
away friendship. And when you are in friendship a dialogue becomes
possible. In dialogue you listen, and if you have to speak, you speak
not to contradict the other, you speak just to seek, to inquire. You
speak, not with a conclusion already reached, but with an inquiry, an
ongoing inquiry. You are not trying to prove something: you speak from
innocence, not from philosophy. Philosophy is never innocent, it is
always cunning, it is a device of the mind.</p><p>Three friends were discussing life – because between friends a
dialogue is possible. So in the East it has been the tradition that
unless you find friendship, love, reverence, trust, no inquiry is
possible. If you go to a master and your boat is filled with your ideas,
there can be no contact, there can be no dialogue. First you have to be
empty so that friendship becomes possible, so that you can look without
any ideas floating across your eyes, so that you can look without
conclusions. And whenever you can look without conclusions, your
perspective is vast, it is not confined.</p><p><br></p><p>A Hindu can read The Bible, but he never understands it. Really, he
never reads it, he cannot listen to it. A Christian can read the Gita,
but he remains the outsider. He never penetrates its innermost being, he
never reaches the inner realm, he moves round and round it. He already
knows that only Christ is true, he already knows that only through
Christ is salvation; he already knows that only Christ is the son of
God. How can he listen to Krishna? Only Christ is truth. Krishna is
bound to be untrue, at the most, a beautiful untruth, but never true. Or
if he concedes much, then he will say, approximately true.</p><p><br></p><p>But what do you mean when you say approximately true? It is untrue!
Truth is either there or not. Nothing can be approximately true. Truth
is, or truth is not. It is always total. You cannot divide it. You
cannot say it is true to some degree. No, truth knows no degree. Either
it is or it is not.</p><p>So when the mind contains the conclusion that Christ is the only
truth, then it is impossible to listen to Krishna. Even if you come
across him on the path you will not be able to listen to him. Even if
you meet Buddha you will not meet him.</p><p><br></p><p>And the whole world is filled with conclusions. Someone is a
Chris-tian, someone is a Hindu, someone is a Jaina, someone is a
Buddhist – that is why truth is missing! A religious person cannot be a
Christian, a Hindu, or a Buddhist, a religious person can only be a
sincere inquirer. He inquires and he remains open without any
conclusions. His boat is empty.</p><p><br></p><p>Three friends discussing life.… Only friends can discuss because then
it becomes a dialogue, then the relationship is of I and thou. When you
are debating, the relationship is of I and it. The other is a thing to
be converted, convinced, the other is not a thou; the other has no
significance, the other is just a number.</p><p><br></p><p>In friendship the other is significant, the other has intrinsic
value, the other is an end in himself, you are not trying to convert
him. How can you convert a person? What foolishness! The very effort to
convert a person is foolish. A person is not a thing. A person is so big
and so vast that no theory can be more important than a person. No Bible
is more important than a person, no Gita is more important than a
person. A person means the very glory of life. You can love a person but
you can never convert a person. If you try to convert, you are trying to
manipulate. Then the person has become a means and you are
exploiting.</p><p>Dialogue is possible when your I says thou, when the other is loved,
when there is no ideology behind it. The other is simply loved, and
whether he is a Christian or Hindu doesn’t matter. This is what
friendship means – and friends can discuss life because dialogue is
possible.</p><p>ONE SAID:</p><p>“CAN MEN LIVE TOGETHER AND KNOW NOTHING OF IT,</p><p>WORK TOGETHER AND PRODUCE NOTHING?</p><p><br></p><p>CAN THEY FLY AROUND IN SPACE</p><p><br></p><p>AND FORGET TO EXIST, WORLD WITHOUT END?”</p><p>He is not proposing a theory, he is simply raising a question. And
remember, you can raise a question in two ways. Sometimes you raise a
question only because you have to supply an answer and the answer is
already there – you raise the question just to answer it. Then the
question is not real, it is false. The answer is already there. The
question is just a trick, rhetorical; it is not real, authentic.</p><p>The question is authentic when there is no answer in you, when you
question but you don’t question from an answer, when you question simply
to look; the question leaves you empty, just open, inviting,
inquiring.</p><p><br></p><p>ONE SAID:</p><p>“CAN MEN LIVE TOGETHER AND KNOW NOTHING OF IT...?”</p><p><br></p><p>We live together and we never know anything of what togetherness is.
You can live together for years without knowing what togetherness is.
Look all over the world – people are living together, nobody lives
alone: husbands with wives, wives with husbands, children with parents,
parents with friends; everybody is living together. Life exists in
togetherness, but do you know what togetherness is?</p><p>Living with a wife for forty years, you may not have lived with her
for a single moment. Even while making love to her you may have been
thinking of other things. Then you were not there, the lovemaking was
just mechanical.</p><p>I have heard that once Mulla Nasruddin went to a film with his wife.
They had been married for at least twenty years. The film was one of
those torrid foreign films! As they were leaving the cinema his wife
said, “Nasruddin, you never love me like those actors were doing in the
film. Why?”</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin said, “Are you crazy? Do you know how much they are paid
for doing such things?”</p><p><br></p><p>People go on living with each other without any love because you love
only when it pays. And how can you love if you love only when it pays?
Then love has also become a commodity in the market: then it is not a
relationship, it is not a togetherness, it is not a celebration. You are
not happy being with the other, at the most you just tolerate the
other.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin’s wife was on her deathbed and the doctor said,
“Nasruddin, I must be frank with you; in such moments it is better to be
truthful. Your wife cannot be saved. The disease has gone beyond us, and
you must prepare yourself. Don’t allow yourself to suffer, accept it, it
is your fate. Your wife is going to die.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin said, “Don’t worry. If I could suffer with her for so many
years, I can suffer for a few hours more!”</p><p><br></p><p>At the most we tolerate. And whenever you think in terms of
toleration, you are suffering, your togetherness is suffering. That is
why Jean-Paul Sartre says, “The other is hell”...because with the other
you simply suffer, the other becomes the bondage, the other becomes the
domination. The other starts creating trouble, and your freedom is lost,
your happiness is lost. Then it becomes a routine, a tolerance. If you
are tolerating the other how can you know the beauty of togetherness?
Really, it has never happened.</p><p>Marriage almost always never happens, because marriage means the
celebration of togetherness. It is not a license. No registry office can
give you marriage; no priest can give it to you as a gift. It is a
tremendous revolution in the being, it is a great transformation in your
very style of life, and it can happen only when you celebrate
togetherness, when the other is no longer felt as the other, when you no
longer feel yourself as I. When the two are not really two, a bridge has
happened, they have become one in a certain sense. Physically they
remain two, but as far as the innermost being is concerned, they have
become one. They may be two poles of one existence but they are not two.
A bridge exists. That bridge gives you glimpses of togetherness.</p><p><br></p><p>It is one of the rarest things to come across a marriage. People live
together because they cannot live alone. Remember this: because they
cannot live alone, that is why they live together. To live alone is
uncomfortable, to live alone is uneconomical, to live alone is
difficult, that is why they live together. The reasons are negative.</p><p><br></p><p>A man was going to get married and somebody asked him, “You have
always been against marriage, why have you suddenly changed your
mind?”</p><p>He said, “Winter is coming on and people say that it is going to be
very cold. Central heating is</p><p>beyond me and a wife is cheaper!”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the logic. You live with someone because it is comfortable,
convenient, economical, cheaper. To live alone is really difficult: a
wife is so many things, the housekeeper, the cook, the servant, the
nurse – so many things. She is the cheapest labor in the world, doing so
many things without being paid at all. It is an exploitation.</p><p><br></p><p>Marriage exists as an institution of exploitation, it is not
togetherness. That is why no happiness comes out of it as a flowering.
It cannot. Out of the roots of exploitation how can ecstasy be born?</p><p>There are your so-called saints who keep saying that you are
miserable because you live in a family, because you live in the world.
They say, “Leave everything, renounce!” And their logic appears to be
right, not because it IS right, but because you have missed
togetherness. Otherwise, all those saints would seem absolutely wrong.
One who has known togetherness has known the divine; one who is really
married has known the divine, because love is the greatest door.</p><p>But togetherness is not there and you live together without knowing
what togetherness is; you live that way for seventy, eighty years
without knowing what life is. You drift without any roots in life. You
just move from one moment to another without tasting what life gives
you. And it is not given to you at birth. It is not hereditary to know
life.</p><p><br></p><p>Life comes through birth but the wisdom, the experience, the
ecs-tasy, has to be learnt. Hence the meaning of meditation. You have to
earn it, you have to grow towards it, you have to attain a certain
maturity; only then will you be able to know it.</p><p><br></p><p>Life can open to you only in a certain moment of maturity. But people
live and die childishly. They never really grow, they never attain to
maturity.</p><p>What is maturity? Just becoming sexually mature does not mean you are
mature. Ask the psychologists: they say that the average adult mental
age remains nearabout thirteen or fourteen. Your physical body goes on
growing but your mind stops at about the age of thirteen. It is no
wonder you behave so foolishly, why your life becomes a continuous
foolishness! A mind which has not grown up is bound to do something
wrong every moment.</p><p><br></p><p>And the immature mind always throws responsibility onto the other.
You feel unhappy and think that it is because everybody else is creating
hell for you. “The other is hell.” I say this assertion of Sartre is
very immature. If you are mature, the other can also become heaven. The
other is whatsoever you are because the other is just a mirror, he
reflects you.</p><p><br></p><p>When I say maturity, I mean an inner integrity. And this inner
integrity comes only when you stop making others responsible, when you
stop saying that the other is creating your suffering, when you start
realizing that you are the creator of your suffering. This is the first
step towards maturity: I am responsible. Whatsoever is happening, it is
my doing.</p><p><br></p><p>You feel sad. Is this your doing? You will feel very much disturbed,
but if you can remain with this feeling, sooner or later you will be
able to stop doing many things. This is what the theory of karma is all
about. You are responsible. Don’t say society is responsible, don’t say
that parents are responsible, don’t say the economic conditions are
responsible, don’t throw the responsibility onto anybody. YOU are
responsible.</p><p>In the beginning, this will look like a burden because now you cannot
throw the responsibility on anyone else. But take it.…</p><p><br></p><p>Someone asked Mulla Nasruddin, “Why do you look so sad?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “My wife has insisted that I stop gambling, smoking,
drinking, playing cards. I have stopped all</p><p>of them.”</p><p><br></p><p>So the man said, “Your wife must be very happy now.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin said, “That is the problem. Now she cannot find anything to
complain about, so she is very unhappy. She starts talking, but she
cannot find anything to complain about. Now she cannot make me
responsible for anything and I have never seen her so unhappy. I thought
that when I gave up all these things she would cheer up, but she has
become more unhappy than ever.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you go on throwing responsibility onto others and they all do
whatsoever you tell them to do, you will end up committing suicide.
Eventually there will be nowhere left to throw your
responsibilities.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is good to have a few faults; it helps others to be happy. If
there is a really perfect husband, the wife will leave him. How can you
dominate a perfect man? So even if you don’t want to, go on doing
something wrong so the wife can dominate you and feel happy!</p><p><br></p><p>Where there is a perfect husband there is bound to be divorce. Find a
perfect man and you will all be against him, because you cannot condemn,
you cannot say anything wrong about him. Our minds love to throw
responsibility onto somebody else. Our minds want to com-plain. It makes
us feel good, because then we are not responsible, we are unburdened.
But this unburdening is very costly. You are not really unburdened, you
are getting more and more burdened. Only you are not alert.</p><p>People have lived for seventy years, and for many many lives, without
knowing what life is. They were not mature, they were not integrated,
they were not centered. They lived on the periphery.</p><p>If your periphery meets the other’s periphery a clash happens, and if
you go on being concerned that the other person is wrong, you remain on
the periphery. Once you realize, “I am responsible for my being;
whatsoever has happened, I am the cause, I have done it,” suddenly your
consciousness shifts from the periphery to the center. Now you become,
for the first time, the center of your world.</p><p><br></p><p>Now much can be done...because whatsoever you don’t like, you can
drop; whatsoever you like, you can adopt; whatsoever you feel is true,
you can follow, and whatsoever you feel is untrue, you need not follow,
because you are now centered and rooted in yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>One friend asked:</p><p><br></p><p>“CAN MEN LIVE TOGETHER AND KNOW NOTHING OF IT,</p><p><br></p><p>WORK TOGETHER AND PRODUCE NOTHING? CAN THEY FLY AROUND IN SPACE</p><p>AND FORGET TO EXIST, WORLD WITHOUT END?”</p><p><br></p><p>THE THREE FRIENDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER.…</p><p><br></p><p>Only friends look at each other. When there is someone to whom you
feel antagonistic, you never look at him. You avoid his eyes. Even if
you have to look at him, your look is vacant, you don’t allow your eyes
to absorb him; he is something foreign, rejected.</p><p>The eyes are the doors. You need only look towards a person and you
can absorb him, let him melt in you.</p><p><br></p><p>THE THREE FRIENDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER.…</p><p>One friend made the inquiry, the other two were not in any hurry to
answer. They waited, they were patient. If there had been any conclusion
in their mind, they would have spoken immediately. But they looked at
each other. They felt the situation, the inquiry, the heart of the
inquiry, the meaning of the question, the depth of the question.
Remember, if you can feel the depth of a question, the answer is almost
found. But nobody has the patience, nobody is ready to go deep into a
question. You ask, but you never really go into the inquiry. You ask for
the answer immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>THE THREE FRIENDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND BURST OUT LAUGHING.</p><p>The fact, the question, the penetration of it, the depth, the
reality, the fact of it, showed plainly that no answer was needed. Any
answer would have been foolish, any answer would have been
superficial.</p><p>It is said about Buddha that millions of times people used to ask him
questions and he would not answer. If the question demanded a
superficial answer, he would not answer; if somebody asked, “Is there a
God?” he remained silent. And people are foolish. They began to think
that he didn’t believe in God, otherwise he would say yes; or they
thought he was ignorant, he didn’t know, otherwise he would say either
yes or no!</p><p><br></p><p>When you ask a question such as, “Does God exist?” you don’t know
what you are asking. Do you think this is a question to be answered?
Then you are stupid. Can such vital questions be answered? Then you
don’t know the depth of it; then this is curiosity, not inquiry.</p><p>If the man who was asking Buddha was an authentic seeker, then he
would have remained with Buddha’s silence – because the silence was the
answer. In that silence he would have felt the question, in that silence
the question would have asserted itself strongly. Against the background
of the silence it would have become clearer. A clarity would have come
to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you ask a deep question, no answer is required. All that is
required is to remain with the question. Don’t move here and there,
remain with the question and wait. The very question will become the
answer. The question, if you go deep into it, will lead to the very
source from where the answer also flows. It is in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha has not answered any real question – and remember that about
me also. I go on answering your questions, but I also cannot answer your
real questions – and you have not asked yet. Whenever you ask the real
question, I am not going to answer, because no real question can be
answered, it is not an intellectual thing. Only from heart to heart the
transmission happens, not from head to head.</p><p><br></p><p>THE THREE FRIENDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER.…</p><p><br></p><p>What happened in that look? They were not heads in that look, they
became hearts. They looked at each other, they felt, they tasted the
question – and it was so real that there was no answer to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, we live without knowing what life is. Yes, we live together
without knowing what togetherness is. Yes, we live, forgetting
completely that we exist. We have been flying round and round in the sky
without knowing where we are going or why.</p><p><br></p><p>The question was so real that if any answer had been given, that
answer would be foolish. Only a fool would answer such a question. They
looked at each other, they really looked into each other, and burst out
laughing. Why burst out laughing? The whole situation is so absurd.
Really, we live without knowing what life is; we exist without becoming
aware of existence, we journey and journey without knowing from where or
to what or why.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is a mystery. Whenever you confront a mystery laughter will
arise, for how can you answer a mystery?</p><p>What is the most mysterious thing in you? Laughter is the most
mysterious thing in you. No animal can laugh, only man. It is the
suprememost glory of man. No animal laughs, no trees laugh – only man
laughs. Laughter is the most mysterious element in man.</p><p>Aristotle defined man as the rational being. It is not a good
definition because reason exists in other animals also. The difference
is only of degree, and it is not much. Man can only be defined as the
laughing and weeping animal, no other definition will do, because no
other animal can weep, no other animal can laugh. This polarity exists
only in humanity. This is something mysterious, most mysterious, in
man.</p><p><br></p><p>Anger exists all over, it is nothing. Sex exists all over, it is
nothing, it is not so mysterious. If you want to understand sex, you can
understand animal sex, and all that is applicable to animal sex will be
applicable to man. In that way man is nothing more.</p><p>Anger, violence, aggression, possessiveness, jealousy, everything
exists and exists more purely and simply in animals than in you.
Everything is confused in you. That is why psychologists have to study
rats just to study man. They are simple, clear, less confused, and
whatsoever they conclude about rats is also true of you. All the
psychology laboratories are filled with rats. It has become the most
important animal for psychologists because it is like the human in so
many ways.</p><p><br></p><p>The rat is the only animal which follows humanity wherever it goes.
It is universal. If you find a man in Siberia, there will be a rat
somewhere nearby. Wherever he goes, the rat follows – I suspect that
rats have already reached the moon. No other animal can exist everywhere
like the rat. And its behavior is absolutely human. Understand the
behavior of the rat and you have understood humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>But the rat cannot laugh, the rat cannot weep. Laughter and weeping
are two aspects of something which exists only in man. If you want to
understand laughter and weeping you have to study humanity; there is no
other way it can be studied. That is why I call it the most distinctive
quality of the human mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you feel mystery you have two alternatives: either you weep
or you laugh. It depends on your personality, your type. It is possible,
if they had been different types of personality, that the three friends
would have wept. When such a mystery surrounds you, when you encounter
such an unknowable mystery that no explanation is possible, what can you
do? How can you respond?</p><p>But laughter is better than weeping because weeping comes when the
mystery of death surrounds you. Then you weep. And the question was
about life so it was relevant to laugh. Whenever you encounter the
mystery of death you weep, you feel the relevance whenever death is
there.</p><p>The question was about life, not about death. So it seems relevant
that they should look into each other, into the life that was in each –
the life pulsating, the life dancing all around and with no explanation,
with no secret book to reveal the keys; life in its total mystery, in
its total unknowability.</p><p><br></p><p>What was there to do? They were not philosophers, they were truthful
men, mystics. They laughed, they had no explanation.</p><p>THUS THEY WERE BETTER FRIENDS THAN BEFORE.</p><p><br></p><p>This is beautiful! Whenever there is an explanation enmity arises,
whenever you believe in something you are divided. Belief creates
conflict. The whole world is divided because of belief. You are a Hindu
and someone is a Mohammedan, and you are enemies. Why are you enemies? –
because of your belief. Belief creates the conflict; foolish
explanations, ideologies, create conflict, war.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at this: if there is no explanation, who is a Hindu and who is a
Mohammedan? And how can you fight? For what? Men have always been
fighting over philosophies, shedding blood, murdering each other, just
for foolish beliefs. And if you DO look into beliefs, you can see the
foolishness – not of your beliefs, but of others’ beliefs! Your belief
is something sacred, but everyone else’s belief looks foolish!</p><p>All beliefs are foolish. You cannot see your own because it is so
near. Really, explanations are foolish, stupid.</p><p>I have heard that a flock of birds was flying south for the winter.
One bird at the rear asked another,</p><p>“How come we always follow this idiot leader?”</p><p>The other said, “In the first place, all leaders are idiots...”
otherwise who wants to lead? Only the foolish are always ready to lead.
A wise man hesitates. Life is so mysterious – it is not a readymade
path. How can you lead? A wise man hesitates and an idiot is always
ready to lead.</p><p><br></p><p>“...And in the second place, he has got the map, so every year we
have to follow him.”</p><p><br></p><p>Life has no map and there is no possibility of making a map. It is a
pathless path. Without explanations how can you be divided? If there is
no explanation, the world will be one. But there are millions of
explanations, millions of fragments.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu says a really very penetrating thing:</p><p><br></p><p>THEY HAD NO EXPLANATION,</p><p><br></p><p>THUS THEY WERE BETTER FRIENDS THAN BEFORE.</p><p><br></p><p>Now there was nothing to be enemies about, nothing to fight over.
They laughed, and the laughter made them one. They laughed, and the
laughter led them into a togetherness. Explain and you are divided,
become philosophical and you are separated from others, become a Hindu,
a Mohammedan, a Buddhist, then all others are enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at the mystery and laugh, and humanity is one. And then there is
no need to say that Christians are brothers of Hindus, Hindus are
brothers of Mohammedans. First divide them, make them ill with be-liefs,
and then supply this medicine: you are all brothers. And have you seen
brothers? They fight more than enemies! So what is the use of making
them brothers?</p><p>Man fights for his explanations. All fights are foolish. Man fights
for his flags, and look at the flags! What type of foolishness, what
type of madness exists in the world? For flags, for symbols, for
beliefs, for ideologies?</p><p><br></p><p>Says Chuang Tzu: THEY HAD NO EXPLANATION...they laughed. In that
mysterious moment they became one, better friends than before.</p><p>If you really want to be a friend, have no explanations and no
conclusions, don’t believe in anything.</p><p>And then you are not divided, then humanity is one, then there is no
barrier. And love exists not through mind, it exists through
feeling.</p><p>They laughed. Laughter comes from the heart, laughter comes from the
belly, laughter comes from the total being. When three people laugh,
they become friends. When three people weep, they become friends. When
three people debate, they become enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>THEN ONE FRIEND DIED. CONFUCIUS SENT A DISCIPLE</p><p>TO HELP THE OTHER TWO CHANT HIS OBSEQUIES.</p><p><br></p><p>Confucius is the man of manners par excellence. Nobody can transcend
him. So he is always the butt of Chuang Tzu and Lao Tzu. They bring
Confucius into their stories just to laugh at his foolishness.</p><p><br></p><p>What was his foolishness? He lived by a system, he lived by a
form-ula, by theories and beliefs. He was the perfectly civilized man,
the most perfect gentleman the world has ever known. He moves, and he
moves according to the rule. He looks, and he looks according to the
rule. He laughs, and he laughs according to the rule. He never moves
beyond the boundary, he lives in a constant bondage of his own making.
So he is the butt of their laughter, and Chuang Tzu and Lao Tzu very
much enjoy bringing him into their stories.</p><p><br></p><p>THEN ONE FRIEND DIED.</p><p><br></p><p>CONFUCIUS SENT A DISCIPLE</p><p><br></p><p>TO HELP THE OTHER TWO CHANT HIS OBSEQUIES.</p><p><br></p><p>Neither life nor death is a mystery to him. It is something with a
place in a system, and some formality had to be followed. So he sent his
disciples to see whether the dead man had been disposed of according to
the rules, with the right prayer, the right chanting – as written in the
books. The dead should be respected.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the difference. A man who lives through manners is always
thinking of respect, never of love. And what is respect in comparison to
love? Love is something alive; respect is absolutely dead.</p><p>THE DISCIPLE FOUND</p><p><br></p><p>THAT ONE FRIEND HAD COMPOSED A SONG WHILE THE OTHER PLAYED THE
LUTE.</p><p>This was unbelievable! This was disrespectful to a person who is
dead! The dead body was lying there, and one friend had composed a song.
They loved the other man, and when you love a man you want to give him
the last farewell through your love, not through books, not through a
readymade song which so many have chanted, so many have used, something
already rotten and rubbish. They made up a song of their own, fresh,
young. Of course, it was homemade, not produced in a factory, not
mass-produced. Just homemade, not very polished of course, because they
were not poets, they were friends, and they didn’t know how poetry was
created. The meter may have been wrong and the grammar incorrect, but
love doesn’t care about grammar, love doesn’t care about meter, love
doesn’t care about rhythm, because love has such a vital rhythm of its
own, it need not care. When there is no love, everything has to be taken
care of because you have to substitute care for love.</p><p><br></p><p>One was playing the lute – and I know that he was not a lute player
either. But how do you say goodbye to a friend? It must come from your
heart, it must be spontaneous, it cannot be readymade. That is the
point.</p><p>THEY SANG:</p><p><br></p><p>“HEY SUNG HU, WHERE’D YOU GO?”</p><p><br></p><p>The mystery! They did not say, “You are going to heaven.” They don’t
know. Otherwise, when someone dies you say, “He has gone to heaven.”
Then who will go to hell? No one seems to go to hell.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, the word for a dead person is SWARGIYA. It means, one who
has gone to heaven. Then who is going to hell? They didn’t know, so what
was the point of uttering a falsehood? Who knows where this man had
gone, this Sung Hu – to hell or heaven? Who knows whether hell and
heaven exist? Nobody knows; it is a mystery, and one should not defile a
mystery, one should not make it profane, one should not assert
falsehoods. It is such a sacred thing, one should not say anything which
is not known directly.</p><p><br></p><p>“HEY, SUNG HU, WHERE’D YOU GO?”</p><p><br></p><p>– it was a question mark.</p><p><br></p><p>“HEY, SUNG HU, WHERE’D YOU GO?</p><p><br></p><p>YOU HAVE GONE WHERE YOU REALLY WERE, AND WE ARE HERE – DAMN IT, WE
ARE HERE!”</p><p>They say, “You have gone to the place from where you came.” This is a
secret law: the ultimate can only be the beginning. The circle goes
round and becomes perfect, complete, and it reaches the same point it
started from. The end cannot be anything else but the beginning, the
death cannot be anything else but the birth. The final should be the
source, the original. One is born out of nothingness and then one dies
and moves into nothingness. The boat was empty when you were born and
when you die the boat will be empty again. Just a flash of lightning.
For a few moments you are in the body and then you disappear. Nobody
knows from where you came and where you go.</p><p><br></p><p>They don’t claim any knowledge. They say, “This much we feel: Sung
Hu, you have gone to the place from where you came, and damn it, we are
still here.” So they are not sorry for Hu, they are sorry for
themselves, that they are hanging in the middle and his circle is
perfect.</p><p>Whenever somebody dies, have you felt this? Are you sorry for the
person who is dead or sorry for yourself? Really, when someone dies, are
you sad for him or her, or for yourself? Everybody is sorry for himself
because every death brings the news that you are going to die. But a
person who can laugh at the mystery of life knows what it is, because
only knowledge, real wisdom, can laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>Where you really were you have gone...</p><p><br></p><p>“AND WE ARE HERE – DAMN IT, WE ARE HERE!”</p><p><br></p><p>And we are still in the middle. Our journey is incomplete, but your
circle has become perfect. So they are sorry for themselves, and if they
weep, they are weeping for themselves. For the friend who has departed
they have nothing but a song, nothing but a celebration of the heart. If
they are sorry, they are sorry for themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>This is something to be understood very deeply. If you understand
life, if you can laugh at it, then death is the completion, then it is
not the end. Remember, death is not the end of life, it is the
completion, it is the climax, the crescendo, the peak from where the
wave returns to the original source.</p><p>They are sorry for themselves, that their wave is hanging in the
middle. They have not reached the crescendo, the peak, and their friend
has reached where he was before. He has reached home. Those who
understand life, only they can understand death, because life and death
are not two. Death is the peak, the ultimate, the final flowering, the
fragrance of life.</p><p><br></p><p>Death looks ugly to you because you have never known life, and death
creates fear in you because you are afraid of life. Remember, whatsoever
your attitude towards life, your attitude towards death will be the
same. If you are scared of death you are scared of life; if you love
life, you will love death, because death is nothing but the highest
peak, the completion. The song reaches its end, the river falls into the
ocean. The river came from the ocean in the first place. Now the circle
is complete, the river has arrived at the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>THEN THE DISCIPLE OF CONFUCIUS BURST IN ON THEM AND EXCLAIMED:</p><p>“MAY I INQUIRE WHERE YOU FOUND THIS</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE RUBRICS FOR OBSEQUIES, THIS FRIVOLOUS CAROLING</p><p>IN THE PRESENCE OF THE DEPARTED?”</p><p>The disciple of Confucius cannot understand them. To him they look
frivolous, disrespectful. What type of song is this? Where did you get
it? It is not authorized, it is not from the Vedas. MAY I INQUIRE WHERE
YOU FOUND THIS...?</p><p><br></p><p>Everything should be done according to the books, according to The
Bible, to the Vedas. But life cannot be according to the books – life
always transcends books, it always goes beyond; life always throws books
aside, moves ahead.</p><p><br></p><p>Where have you found this, this frivolous caroling in the presence of
the departed? You should be respectful. Someone has departed, someone is
dead and what are you doing? This is profane!</p><p><br></p><p>THE TWO FRIENDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND LAUGHED:</p><p>“POOR FELLOW, HE DOESN’T KNOW THE NEW LITURGY!”</p><p>He doesn’t know the new scripture, he doesn’t know the new religion.
And that is what is happening here every day – the new liturgy.</p><p><br></p><p>A man was here just a few days ago, a professor of history, and he
asked me, “To what tradition do you belong?”</p><p>I said, “To no tradition.”</p><p><br></p><p>He had come here from America to make a film of the meditation
techniques, of the camp, of what I say, of what is happening here. The
moment he heard that I don’t belong to any tradition, he simply
disappeared. Then I don’t belong to history, it is obvious.</p><p><br></p><p>Poor fellow, he does not know the new liturgy!</p><p><br></p><p>Enough for today.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s3>8</span></p><p><br></p><p>The Useless</p><p><br></p><p>17 July 1974 am in Buddha Hall</p><p><br></p><p>HUI TZU SAID TO CHUANG TZU:</p><p><br></p><p>“ALL YOUR TEACHING IS CENTERED ON WHAT HAS NO USE.”</p><p><br></p><p>CHUANG TZU REPLIED:</p><p><br></p><p>“IF YOU HAVE NO APPRECIATION FOR WHAT HAS NO USE YOU CANNOT BEGIN TO
TALK ABOUT WHAT CAN BE USED. THE EARTH, FOR EXAMPLE, IS BROAD AND
VAST,</p><p>BUT OF ALL THIS EXPANSE A MAN USES ONLY A FEW INCHES</p><p><br></p><p>UPON WHICH HE HAPPENS TO BE STANDING AT THE TIME.</p><p><br></p><p>“NOW SUPPOSE YOU SUDDENLY TAKE AWAY</p><p><br></p><p>ALL THAT HE IS NOT ACTUALLY USING,</p><p><br></p><p>SO THAT ALL AROUND HIS FEET A GULF YAWNS, AND HE STANDS IN THE
VOID</p><p><br></p><p>WITH NOWHERE SOLID EXCEPT UNDER EACH FOOT,</p><p><br></p><p>HOW LONG WILL HE BE ABLE TO USE WHAT HE IS USING?”</p><p><br></p><p>HUI TZU SAID:</p><p><br></p><p>“IT WOULD CEASE TO SERVE ANY PURPOSE.”</p><p><br></p><p>CHUANG TZU CONCLUDED:</p><p>“THIS SHOWS THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY</p><p><br></p><p>OF WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE NO USE.”</p><p><br></p><p>Life is dialectical, that is why it is not logical. Logic means that
the opposite is really opposite, and life always implies the opposite in
itself. In life the opposite is not really the opposite, it is the
complementary. Without it nothing is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, life exists because of death. If there is no death there
cannot be any life. Death is not the end and death is not the enemy –
rather, on the contrary, because of death life becomes possible. So
death is not somewhere in the end, it is involved here and now. Each
moment has its life and its death; otherwise existence is
impossible.</p><p>There is light, there is darkness. For logic they are opposites, and
logic will say: If it is light, there cannot be any darkness, if it is
dark, then there cannot be any light. But life says quite the contrary.
Life says: If there is darkness it is because of light; if there is
light it is because of darkness. We may not be able to see the other
when it is hidden just around the corner.</p><p><br></p><p>There is silence because of sound. If there is no sound at all, can
you be silent? How can you be silent? The opposite is needed as a
background. Those who follow logic always go wrong because their life
becomes lopsided. They think of light, then they start denying darkness;
they think of life, then they start fighting death.</p><p><br></p><p>That is why there exists no tradition in the world which says that
God is both light and darkness. There is one tradition which says that
God is light, he is not darkness. There is no darkness in God for the
people who believe God is light. There is another tradition that says
that God is darkness – but for them there is no light. Both are wrong,
because both are logical, they deny the opposite. And life is so vast,
it carries the opposite in itself. It is not denied, it is embraced.</p><p>Once somebody said to Walt Whitman, one of the greatest poets ever
born, “Whitman, you go on contradicting yourself. One day you say one
thing, another day you say just the opposite.”</p><p><br></p><p>Walt Whitman laughed and said, “I am vast. I contain all the
contradictions.”</p><p>Only small minds are consistent, and the narrower the mind, the more
consistent. When the mind is vast, everything is involved: light is
there, darkness is there, God is there and the devil too, in his total
glory.</p><p><br></p><p>If you understand this mysterious process of life which moves through
the opposites, which is dialectical, where the opposite helps, gives
balance, gives tone, makes the background, then only can you understand
Chuang Tzu – because the whole Taoist vision is based on the
complementariness of the opposites.</p><p>They use two words, yin and yang. They are opposites, male and
female. Just think of a world which is totally male or a world which is
totally female. It will be dead. The moment it is born it will be dead.
There cannot be any life in it. If it is a female world – women, women
and women, and no men – women will commit suicide. The opposite is
needed because the opposite is attractive. The opposite becomes the
magnet, it pulls you; the opposite brings you out of yourself, the
opposite breaks your prison, the opposite makes you vast. Whenever the
opposite is denied there will be trouble. And that is what we have been
doing, hence so much trouble in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Man has tried to create a society which is basically male, that is
why there is so much trouble – the woman has been denied, she has been
thrown out. In past centuries the woman was never to be seen anywhere.
She was hidden in the back chambers of the house, and she was not even
allowed in the drawing room. You couldn’t meet her on the streets, you
couldn’t see her in the shops. She was not part of life. The world went
ugly, because how can you deny the opposite? The world became lopsided,
all balance was lost. The world went mad.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman is still not allowed to move in life; she is really not yet
a part, a vital part of life. Men move in men-oriented groups – the
exclusively male club where boys meet, the market, politics, the
scientific group. Everywhere it is lopsided. Man dominates, that is why
there is so much misery. And when one of the polar opposites dominates,
there will be misery, because the other feels hurt and takes
revenge.</p><p>So every woman takes her revenge in the house. Of course, she cannot
go out and move in the world and take revenge on humanity, on mankind.
She takes revenge on her husband. There is constant conflict.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that Mulla Nasruddin was saying to his son, “It is none
of your business, don’t ask such things. Who are you to ask me how I met
your mother? But I will tell you one thing: she sure cured me of
whistling.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then he said, “And this is the moral of the story: if you don’t want
to be unhappy like me, never whistle at a girl!”</p><p>Why is the wife always in conflict? It is not the person, it is not a
personal thing. It is the revenge of the woman, of the female, of the
denied opposite. And this man in the house, the husband, is the
representative of the whole male world, the male-oriented world. She is
fighting.</p><p>Family life is so miserable because we have not heard what Chuang Tzu
says. There are so many wars because we have not heard that the opposite
has to be merged. By negating it you invite trouble, and on every path,
on every level, in every dimension, it is the same thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu says that if you deny the useless, then there will be no
use in the world. If you deny the useless, the playful, the fun, there
cannot be any work, any duty. This is very difficult because our whole
emphasis is on the useful.</p><p><br></p><p>If somebody asks you what a house consists of, you will say, walls.
And Chuang Tzu would say, just like his master Lao Tzu, that a house
consists not of walls but of doors and windows. Their emphasis is on the
other part. They say that walls are useful, but their use depends on the
useless space behind.</p><p>A room is space, not walls. Of course, space is free but walls have
to be purchased. When you purchase a house, what do you purchase? The
walls, the material, the visible. But can you live in the material? Can
you live in the walls? You have to live in the room, in the vacant
space. You purchase the boat, but you have to live in the emptiness.</p><p><br></p><p>So really, what is a house? Emptiness surrounded by walls. And what
is a door? There is nothing. ‘Door’ means there is nothing, no wall,
emptiness. But you cannot enter the house if there is no door; if there
is no window then no sun will enter, no breeze will blow. You will be
dead, and your house will become a tomb.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu says: Remember that the house consists of two things: the
walls, the material – the marketable, the utilitarian – and the
emp-tiness surrounded by the walls, the non-utilitarian which cannot be
purchased, which cannot be sold, which has no economic value.</p><p>How can you sell emptiness? But you have to live in the emptiness –
if a man lives only in the walls he will go mad. It is impossible to do
that – but we try to do the impossible. In life, we have chosen the
utilitarian.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, if a child is playing you say, “Stop! What are you
doing? This is useless. Do something useful. Learn, read, at least do
your homework, something useful. Don’t wander around, don’t be a
vaga-bond.” And if you go on insisting on this to a child, by and by you
will kill the useless. Then the child will become just useful, and when
a person is simply useful, he is dead. You can use him, he is a
mechanical thing now, a means, not an end unto himself.</p><p><br></p><p>You are really yourself when you are doing something useless –
painting, not to sell, just enjoying; gardening, just to enjoy; lying
down on the beach, not doing anything, just to enjoy, useless, fun;
sitting silently at the side of a friend.</p><p>Much could be done in these moments. You could go to the shop, to the
market, you could earn something. You could change time into money. You
could get a bigger bank balance because these moments will not come
back. And foolish people say that time is money. They know only one use
for time: how to convert it into more money and more money and more
money. In the end you die with a big bank balance but inside totally
poor, because the inner richness arises only when you can enjoy the
useless.</p><p><br></p><p>What is meditation? People come to me and say, “What is the use of
it? What will we gain out of it? What is the benefit of it?”</p><p>Meditation...and you ask about the benefit? You cannot understand it
because meditation is just useless. The moment I say useless, you feel
uncomfortable because the whole mind has become so utilitarian, so
commodity-oriented that you ask for a result. You cannot concede that
something can be a pleasure unto itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Useless means you enjoy it, but there is no benefit from it; you are
deeply merged in it and it gives you bliss. But when you are deeply in
it, you cannot accumulate that bliss, you cannot make a treasure out of
it.</p><p>In the world two types of people have existed: the utilitarians –
they become scientists, engineers, doctors; and the other branch, the
complementary – poets, the vagabonds, the sannyasins – useless, not
doing anything useful. But they give the balance, they give grace to the
world. Think of a world full of scientists and not a single poet – it
would be absolutely ugly, not worth living in. Think of a world with
everyone in the shops, in the offices, not a single vagabond. It would
be hell. The vagabond gives beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>Two vagabonds were arrested once.… Magistrates and police are the
custodians of the utilitarians. They protect, because this useless part
is dangerous – it can spread! So nowhere are vagabonds, useless people,
allowed. If you are just standing on the street and somebody asks you
what you are doing, and you reply, “Nothing,” the police will
immediately take you to court – because nothing is not allowed! You must
do something. Why are you standing there? If you say simply, “I am
standing and enjoying it,” you are a dangerous man, a hippy. You may be
arrested.</p><p>So the two vagabonds were arrested. The magistrate asked the first
one, “Where do you live?” The man said, “The whole world is my home, the
sky is my shelter; I go everywhere, there is no</p><p>barrier. I am a free man.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then he asked the other, “And where do you live?” He said, “Next door
to him.”</p><p>These people give beauty to the world, they are a perfume. A Buddha
is a vagabond, a Mahavira is a vagabond. This man, this vagabond,
answered that the sky was his only shelter. That is what is meant by the
word DIGAMBER. Mahavira, the last TIRTHANKARA of the Jainas, is known as
digamber. Digamber means naked, only the sky for clothing, nothing else.
The sky is the shelter, the home.</p><p>Whenever the world becomes too utilitarian you create many things,
you possess many things, you become obsessed with things – but the inner
is lost, because the inner can flower only when there are no outer
tensions, when you are not going anywhere, just resting. Then the inner
flowers.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is absolutely useless. What use is the temple? What use is
the mosque? What use is the church? In Russia they have converted all
the temples, mosques, churches into hospitals and into schools,
something useful. Why is this temple standing without any use?
Communists are utilitarians. That is why they are against religion. They
have to be, because religion gives way to the useless, to that which
cannot be in any way exploited, to that which cannot be made a means to
anything else. You can have it, you can be blissful in it, you can feel
the highest ecstasy possible, but you cannot manipulate it. It is a
happening. When you are not doing anything, it happens. And the greatest
has always happened when you are not doing anything. Only the trivial
happens when you are doing something.</p><p><br></p><p>Soren Kierkegaard, a Danish philosopher, has written something very
penetrating. He said, “When I</p><p>started praying, I would go to the church and talk to God<span class=s5></span>” That is what Christians are doing all over the
world. They talk to God in a loud voice as if God is dead. And as if God
is just a foolish entity they advise him what to do and what not to do.
Or, as if God is just a foolish monarch they persuade him, bribe him, to
fulfill the desires that are in them.</p><p>But Kierkegaard said, “I started talking, then suddenly I realized
that this was useless. How can you talk before God? One has to be
silent. What is there to be said? And what can I say which will help God
to know more? He is omnipotent, he is omniscient, knows all, so what is
the purpose of my telling him?”</p><p><br></p><p>And Kierkegaard said, “I talked to him for many years, then suddenly
I realized that this was foolish. So I stopped talking, I became silent.
Then after many years I realized that even silence wouldn’t do. Then the
third step was taken, and that was listening. First I was talking, then
I was not talking, and then I was listening.”</p><p><br></p><p>Listening is different to just being silent, because just being
silent is a negative thing – listening is a positive thing. Just being
silent is passive, listening is an alert passiveness, waiting for
something, not saying anything, but waiting with the whole being. It has
an intensity. And Kierkegaard said, “When this listening happened, then
for the first time prayer happened.”</p><p>But it seems listening is absolutely useless, especially listening to
the unknown; you don’t know where he is. Silence is useless, talking
seems to be useful. Something can be done through talking; with it you
do many things in the world. So you think that if you want to become
religious you will also have to do something.</p><p>But Chuang Tzu said: Religion begins only when you have understood
the futility of all doing, and you have moved to the polar opposite of
nondoing, inactivity, of becoming passive, becoming useless.</p><p><br></p><p>Now we shall enter the sutra, The Useless. HUI TZU SAID TO CHUANG
TZU:</p><p>“ALL YOUR TEACHING IS CENTERED ON WHAT HAS NO USE.”</p><p>This teaching doesn’t seem to be worth much, but Chuang Tzu and his
master were always talking</p><p>about the useless, they even praised men who were useless.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu talks about a man, a hunchback. All the young people of
the town were forcibly entered into the military, into the army, because
they were useful. Only one man, a hunchback, who was useless, was left
behind. Chuang Tzu said: Be like the hunchback, so useless that you are
not slaughtered in the war.</p><p><br></p><p>They go on praising the useless because they say that the useful will
always be in difficulty. The world will use you, everybody is ready to
use you, to manipulate you, to control you. If you are useless nobody
will look at you, people will forget you, they will leave you in
silence, they will not bother about you. They will simply become unaware
that you are.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened to me. I am a useless man. In my childhood days I would
be sitting down just next to my mother. She would look around her and
say, “I would like to send someone to fetch vegetables from the market,
but I cannot see anyone to send” – and I would be sitting there just
next to her! She would say, “I can’t see anyone here!” And I would laugh
inside myself – she couldn’t send me to the market, I was so useless
that she was not aware that I was there.</p><p>Once, my aunt came to stay, and she was not aware of my uselessness.
My mother was saying, “Nobody is in to go to the market. All the
children have gone out and the servant is ill, so what can I do?
Some-one has to be sent.”</p><p><br></p><p>So my aunt said, “Why not send Raja? He is sitting there, not doing
anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>So I was sent. I asked the market vendor there, “Give me the best
vegetables you have got, the best bananas, the best mangoes.” Looking at
me and the way I was talking he must have thought I was a fool, because
nobody ever asks for the best. So he charged me double and gave me all
the rotten things he had, and I came home very happy.</p><p><br></p><p>My mother threw them away and said, “Look! This is why I say nobody
is here.”</p><p>Chuang Tzu insists very much: Be alert and don’t be very useful;
otherwise people will exploit you. Then they will start managing you and
then you will be in trouble. And if you can produce things, they will
force you to produce all your life. If you can do a certain thing, if
you are skillful, then you cannot be wasted.</p><p><br></p><p>He says that uselessness has its own intrinsic utility. If you can be
useful for others, then you have to live for others. Useless, nobody
looks at you, nobody pays any attention to you, nobody is bothered by
your being. You are left alone. In the marketplace you live as if you
are living in the Himalayas. In that solitude you grow. Your whole
energy moves inwards.</p><p><br></p><p>HUI TZU SAID TO CHUANG TZU:</p><p>“ALL YOUR TEACHING IS CENTERED ON WHAT HAS NO USE.”</p><p><br></p><p>CHUANG TZU REPLIED:</p><p><br></p><p>“IF YOU HAVE NO APPRECIATION FOR WHAT HAS NO USE YOU CANNOT BEGIN TO
TALK ABOUT WHAT CAN BE USED.”</p><p>He said that the useless is the other aspect of the useful. You can
talk about the useful only because of the useless. It is a vital part.
If you drop it completely, then nothing will be useful. Things are
useful because there are things which are useless.</p><p>But this has happened to the world. We have cut out all playful
activities thinking that then the whole of our energy will move towards
work. But now work has become a bore. One has to move to the opposite
pole – only then one is rejuvenated.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole day you are awake, at night you fall asleep. What is the
use of sleep? It is wasting time – and no little time. If you live to
ninety, for thirty years of your life you will be asleep, one-third,
eight hours every day. What is the use of it?</p><p>Scientists in Russia have been thinking that this is a wastage of
labor, of energy. This is very uneconomical, so something must be done
about it: some chemical changes or some hormonal changes are nee-ded.
Or, even if something has to be changed in the very genes, the very
cell, it must be done. We have to make a man who is aware, alert, awake
for twenty-four hours.</p><p><br></p><p>Just think...if they succeed, they will kill! Then they will make you
an automaton, just a mechanical device, which goes on working and
working, no day, no night, no rest, no work. There is no opposite to
which you can move and forget!</p><p><br></p><p>And they have started many things. They have started sleep teaching
for small children. Now thousands of children in Soviet Russia sleep
with tape recorders plugged to their ears. While they are sleeping, the
tape recorder is teaching them. Throughout the whole night the tape
recorder is repeating something or other. They go on listening to it and
it becomes part of their memory – sleep teaching, hypno-pedia. And they
say that sooner or later all that we do in schools can be done while the
child is asleep, and then the day can be used in some other way.</p><p><br></p><p>Even sleep has to be exploited. You cannot be allowed to be yourself
even in your sleep. You cannot even be allowed the freedom to dream.
Then what are you? Then you become a cog in the wheel. Then you are just
an efficient part of the wheel, of the mechanism. If you are efficient
it is okay; otherwise you can be discarded, thrown to the junkyard, and
somebody else who is more efficient will replace you.</p><p>What happens after the whole day’s work? You fall asleep. What
happens? You move from the useful to the useless. And that is why in the
morning you feel so fresh, so alive, so unburdened. Your legs have a
dancing quality, your mind can sing, your heart can again feel – all the
dust of work is thrown off, the mirror is again clear. You have a
clarity in the morning. How does it come? It comes through the
useless.</p><p><br></p><p>That is why meditation can give you the greatest glimpses, because it
is the most useless thing in the world. You simply don’t do anything,
you simply move into silence. It is greater than sleep because in sleep
you are unconscious; whatsoever happens, happens unconsciously. You may
be in paradise, but you don’t know it.</p><p><br></p><p>In meditation you move knowingly. Then you become aware of the path:
how to move from the useful world of the without to the useless world
within. And once you know the path, any moment you can simply move
inwards. Sitting in a bus you are not needed to do anything, you are
simply sitting; traveling in a car or train or an airplane, you are not
doing anything, everything is being done by others; you can close your
eyes and move into the useless, the inner. And suddenly everything
becomes silent, and suddenly everything is cool, and suddenly you are at
the source of all life.</p><p><br></p><p>But it has no value on the market. You cannot go and sell it, you
cannot say, “I have great meditation. Is anybody ready to buy it?”
Nobody will be ready to buy it. It is not a commodity, it is
useless.</p><p>CHUANG TZU REPLIED:</p><p><br></p><p>“IF YOU HAVE NO APPRECIATION FOR WHAT HAS NO USE</p><p><br></p><p>YOU CANNOT BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT WHAT CAN BE USED. THE EARTH, FOR
EXAMPLE, IS BROAD AND VAST,</p><p>BUT OF ALL THIS EXPANSE A MAN USES ONLY A FEW INCHES UPON WHICH HE
HAPPENS TO BE STANDING AT THE TIME. “NOW SUPPOSE YOU SUDDENLY TAKE
AWAY</p><p>ALL THAT HE IS NOT ACTUALLY USING,</p><p><br></p><p>SO THAT ALL AROUND HIS FEET A GULF YAWNS, AND HE STANDS IN THE
VOID</p><p>WITH NOWHERE SOLID EXCEPT UNDER EACH FOOT,</p><p><br></p><p>HOW LONG WILL HE BE ABLE TO USE WHAT HE IS USING?”</p><p>This is a beautiful simile. He has got the point. You are sitting
here, and you are using only a small space, two by two. You are not
using the whole earth, the whole earth is useless; you are using only a
small portion, two by two. Says Chuang Tzu: Suppose the whole earth is
taken away, only two by two is left for you; you are standing with each
foot using a few inches of earth. Suppose only that is left and the
whole earth is taken away – how long will you be able to use this small
part that you are using?</p><p><br></p><p>A gulf, an infinite abyss, yawns around you – you will get dizzy
immediately, you will fall into the abyss. The useless earth supports
the useful, and the useless is vast, the useful is very small. And this
is true on all levels of being: the useless is vast, the useful is very
small. If you try to save the useful and forget the useless, sooner or
later you will get dizzy. And this has happened, you are already dizzy
and falling into the abyss.</p><p>All over the world thinking people have a problem: life has no
meaning, life seems to be meaningless. Ask Sartre, Marcel, Jaspers,
Heidegger – they say life is meaningless. Why has life become so
meaningless? It never used to be so. Buddha never said it; Krishna could
dance, sing, enjoy himself; Mohammed could pray and thank God for the
blessing that he showered upon him as life. Chuang Tzu is happy, as
happy as possible, as happy as a man can be. They never said that life
is meaningless. What has happened to the modern mind? Why does life seem
so meaningless?</p><p><br></p><p>The whole earth has been taken away and you are left only on the part
on which you are sitting or standing. You are getting dizzy. All around
you see the abyss and the danger; and you cannot use the earth on which
you are standing now, because you can use it only when the useless is
joined with it. The useless must be there. What does it mean? Your life
has become only work and no play. The play is the useless, the vast; the
work is the useful, the trivial, the small. You have made your</p><p><br></p><p>life completely filled with work. Whenever you start doing something
the first thing that comes to the mind is, what is the use of it? If
there is some use, you do it.</p><p>Sartre sets one of his stories in the coming century, the
twenty-first. A very rich man says, “Love is not for me, it is only for
poor people. As far as I am concerned my servants can do it.”</p><p>Of course, why should a Ford go and waste time loving a woman? A
cheap servant can do that.</p><p>Ford’s time is more valuable. He should put it to some greater
use.</p><p>It is possible! Looking at the human mind as it is, it is possible
that in the future only servants will make love. When you can depute a
servant, why bother yourself? When everything is thought of in terms of
economics, when a Ford, a Rockefeller can make so much better use of
their time, why should they go and waste their time with a woman? They
can send a servant, that will be less trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>It looks absurd to us hearing this but it has already happened in
many dimensions of life. You never play, your servants do that. You are
never an active participant in any fun, others do it for you. You go to
see a football match: others are doing it and you are just watching –
you are a passive spectator, not involved. You go to a movie to see a
film, and others are making love, creating war, violence – everything;
you are just a spectator in the seat. It is so useless you need not
bother to do it. Anyone else can do it, you can just watch. Work YOU do,
fun others do for you. Then why not love? Using the same logic, somebody
else will do it.</p><p><br></p><p>Life seems meaningless because the meaning consists of a balance
between the useful and the useless. You have denied the useless
completely. You have closed the door. Now only the useful is there and
you are burdened too much by it.</p><p>It is a sign of success that if by the age of forty you get ulcers,
it shows that you are successful. If you have passed forty and are now
fifty and still the ulcers have not appeared, you are a failure. What
have you been doing all your life? You must have been wasting time.</p><p><br></p><p>By fifty you really ought to have your first heart attack. Now
scientists have calculated that by forty a successful man must have
ulcers, by fifty the first heart attack. By sixty he is gone – and he
never lived. There was no time to live. He had so many more important
things to do, there was no time to live.</p><p><br></p><p>Look all around you, look at successful people; politicians, rich
men, big industrialists – what is happening to them? Don’t look at the
things they possess, look at them directly, because if you look at the
things you will be deceived. Things don’t have ulcers, cars don’t have
heart attacks, houses are not hospitalized. Don’t look at things,
otherwise you will be deceived. Look at the person bereft of all his
possessions, look directly at him and then you will feel the poverty.
Then even a beggar may be a rich man. Then even a poor man may be richer
as far as life is concerned.</p><p>Success fails, and nothing fails like success, because the man who
succeeds is losing his grip on life – on everything. The man who
succeeds is really bargaining, throwing away the real for the unreal,
throwing away inner diamonds for colored pebbles on the shore;
collecting the pebbles, losing the diamonds.</p><p><br></p><p>A rich man is a loser, a successful man is a failure. But because you
look with the eyes of ambition you look at the possessions. You never
look at the politician, you look at the post, the prime ministership.
You look at the power. You never look at the person who is sitting there
absolutely powerless, missing everything, not even having a glimpse of
what bliss is. He has purchased power, but in purchasing it he has lost
himself. And it is all a bargain.</p><p>I have heard that once, after a mass rally, a political leader was
screaming at his manager. The</p><p>manager couldn’t understand it. The leader said, “I have been
cheated!”</p><p>The manager said, “I don’t understand, the rally was so successful.
Many thousands of people came, and look at your garlands. They have
covered you with flowers, count them.”</p><p><br></p><p>The leader said, “There are only eleven and I paid for twelve.”</p><p>In the end, every successful man will feel that he has been cheated.
That has to happen, it is bound to happen, it is inevitable, because
what are you giving, and what are you receiving? The inner self is being
lost for futile possessions. You can deceive others, but how will you be
able to deceive yourself? In the end you will look at your life and you
will see that you have missed it because of the useful.</p><p><br></p><p>The useless must be there. The useful is like a garden, neat, clean;
the useless is like a vast forest, natural, it cannot be so neat and
clean. Nature has its own beauty and when everything is neat and clean,
it is already dead. A garden cannot be very alive, because you go on
pruning it, cutting it, managing it. A vast forest has a vitality, a
very powerful soul. Go into a forest and you will feel the impact; get
lost in a forest and then you will see the power of it. In a garden you
cannot feel the power; it is not there, it is manmade. You can look at
it, it is beautiful, but it is cultivated, it is managed,
manipulated.</p><p>Really, a garden is a false thing – the real thing is the forest. The
useless is like a vast forest and the useful is just like a garden you
have created around your house. Don’t go on cutting into the forest. It
is okay, your garden is okay, but let it be a part of the vast forest
that is not your garden, but God’s garden.</p><p><br></p><p>And can you think of anything more useless than God? Can you use him
in any way? That is the trouble; that is why we cannot find any meaning
in God. And those who are very meaning-oriented become atheists. They
say there is no God, there cannot be. How can there be a God when God
seems so useless?</p><p><br></p><p>It is better to leave him out, then the world is left for us to
manage and control. Then we can make the whole world a market, we can
change temples into hospitals, into primary schools. But the uselessness
of God is the very basis of all the utility that goes on. If you can
play, your work will become pleasure. If you can enjoy simple fun, if
you can become like children playing, your work will not be a burden to
you. But it is difficult. Your mind keeps thinking in terms of
money.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that once Mulla Nasruddin came home and he found his
wife in bed with his best friend. The friend was very embarrassed and
scared. He said, “Listen, I cannot do anything about it. I am in love
with your wife and she is in love with me. And you being a rational man,
we should come to some arrangement. It is no use fighting about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>So Nasruddin said, “What arrangement do you suggest?”</p><p><br></p><p>His friend said, “We should play a game of cards, and let the wife be
the stake. If I win, you simply leave; if you win, I will never see your
wife again.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin said, “All right, it’s settled.” But then he said, “Let’s
have some cash stakes, one rupee for each point, otherwise the whole
thing is useless. Just for a wife the whole thing is useless. Don’t
waste my time, have some money stakes too.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then the thing becomes useful. Money seems to be the only useful
thing. All those who are utilitarians will be money-mad, because money
can purchase. Money is the essence of all utility. So if Buddha and
people like Buddha renounced, it was not because they were against
money, it was because they were against utility, against the useful. So
they said: Keep all your money. I am moving into the forest. This garden
is no more for me. I will move in the vast, in the uncharted, where one
can be lost. This neat, clean pebbled path, everything known, mapped
out, is not for me.</p><p><br></p><p>When you move into the vastness of uselessness your soul becomes
vast. When you go into the sea with no map you become like the ocean.
Then the very challenge of the unknown creates your soul.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are secure, when there is no problem, when everything is
mathematically planned, settled, your soul shrinks. There is no
challenge for it. The useless gives the challenge.</p><p>“NOW SUPPOSE YOU SUDDENLY TAKE AWAY</p><p><br></p><p>ALL THAT HE IS NOT ACTUALLY USING,</p><p>SO THAT ALL AROUND HIS FEET A GULF YAWNS, AND HE STANDS IN THE
VOID</p><p>WITH NOWHERE SOLID EXCEPT UNDER EACH FOOT,</p><p><br></p><p>HOW LONG WILL HE BE ABLE TO USE WHAT HE IS USING?”</p><p><br></p><p>Without God the world cannot continue any more. Nietzsche declared
just a hundred years ago that God was dead. He did not realize it, but
at the same time he was declaring that we also cannot live any more. He
never thought about that, he thought just the contrary. He said: God is
dead and man is now free to live. But I say to you: If God is dead, man
is dead already. The news may not have reached him yet, but he is dead –
because God is the vast uselessness.</p><p>Man’s world is the utilitarian world, the useful; without the useless
the useful cannot exist. God is the play and man is the work; without
God, work will become meaningless, a burden to be carried somehow. God
is the fun, man is serious; without the fun the seriousness will be too
much, it will be like a disease. Don’t destroy the temples, don’t
destroy the mosques, don’t transform them into hospitals; you can build
other hospitals, you can create other buildings for schools, but let the
useless remain there at the very center of life. That is why the temple
has been placed in the very</p><p><br></p><p>marketplace, in the very center of the town, just to show that the
useless must remain at the very center, otherwise all utility is lost.
The opposite must be taken into account, and the opposite is
greater.</p><p>What is the purpose of life? People keep coming and asking me this.
There is no purpose. There cannot be any. It is purposeless, fun. You
have to enjoy it, you can only enjoy it, you cannot do anything else
about it. It is not marketable. And if you miss a moment you have
missed; you cannot go back.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is just a symbol. One man came to me and said, “In India
there are five hundred thousand sannyasins. This is very uneconomical.
And what are these people doing? They live on others’ labor. They should
not be allowed to exist.”</p><p><br></p><p>In Russia they are not allowed to exist, not a single sannyasin. The
whole land has become like a prison. You are not allowed to be useless.
In China they are killing Buddhist monks and BHIKKUS, they have killed
thousands of them, and they are destroying all the monasteries. They are
turning the whole country into a factory, as if man is just the stomach,
as if man can live by bread alone.</p><p><br></p><p>But man has a heart, and man has a being which is not in any way
purpose-oriented. Man wants to enjoy without cause and without reason.
Man wants to be blissful just for nothing.</p><p>That man asked, “When are you going to stop these sannyasins in
India?” And he was very much against me. He said, “You are increasing
the number of them. Stop it. What use are these sannyasins?”</p><p><br></p><p>And his question seems relevant. If he had gone somewhere else, if he
had asked some other religious head, he would have been given the answer
that they have a use. But he was very disturbed when I said that they
have no use at all.</p><p><br></p><p>But life itself is without use. What is the purpose of it? Where are
you going? What is the result? No purpose, no result, no goal. Life is a
constant ecstasy, moment to moment you can enjoy it but if you start
thinking of results you miss enjoying it, your roots are uprooted, you
are no longer in it, you have become an outsider. And then you will ask
for the meaning, for the purpose.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you observed that when you are happy you never ask, “What is the
purpose of happiness?” When you are in love, have you ever asked, “What
is the purpose of all this?” When in the morning you see the sun rising
and a flock of birds like an arrow in the sky, have you asked, “What is
the purpose of it?” A flower blooms alone in the night, filling the
whole night with its fragrance; have you asked, “What is the purpose of
it?”</p><p>There is no purpose. Purpose is part of the mind, and life exists
mindlessly; hence the insistence on the useless. If you are looking too
hard for use, you cannot drop the mind. How can you drop the mind if you
are looking for some use, some result? You can drop the mind only when
you have come to realize that there is no purpose and mind is not
needed. You can put it aside. It is an unnecessary thing. Of course,
when you go to the market, take it with you. When you sit in the shop,
use it: it is a mechanical device, just like a computer.</p><p><br></p><p>Now scientists say that sooner or later we will supply each child
with a computer which he can carry in his pocket. He need not carry much
mathematics in his mind, he can just push the button and the computer
will do it. Your mind is a natural computer. Why be burdened constantly
by it? When it is not needed, put it aside. But you think it is needed
because you have to do something useful. Who will tell you what is
useful and what is useless? The mind is constantly sorting out: This is
useful, do this; and that is useless, don’t do it. Mind is your manager.
The mind represents use. Meditation represents the useless.</p><p>Move from the useful to the useless, and make this movement so
spontaneous and natural that there is no struggle, no conflict. Make it
as natural as moving in and out of your house. When the mind is needed,
use it as a mechanical device; when it is not in use, put it aside and
forget it. Then be useless and do something useless and your life will
be enriched, your life will become a balance between use and no use. And
that balance transcends both. That is transcendental – neither use nor
non-use.</p><p><br></p><p>“HOW LONG WILL HE BE ABLE TO USE THAT WHICH HE IS USING?”</p><p><br></p><p>HUI TZU SAID:</p><p>“IT WOULD CEASE TO SERVE ANY PURPOSE.”</p><p><br></p><p>CHUANG TZU CONCLUDED:</p><p><br></p><p>“THIS SHOWS THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY</p><p><br></p><p>OF WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE NO USE.”</p><p><br></p><p>Even the useful cannot exist without the useless. The useless is the
base. I say to you, your mind cannot exist without meditation, and if
you try to do the impossible you will go mad. That is what is happening
to many people. They go mad. What is madness? Madness is an effort to do
without meditation, to live only with the mind, without any meditation.
Meditation is the base, even the mind cannot exist without it. And if
you try, then the mind goes mad, goes crazy. It is too much. It is
unbearable. A madman is a man who is a perfect utilitarian. He has tried
the impossible, he has tried to live without meditation, and that is why
he goes mad.</p><p><br></p><p>Psychologists say that if you are not allowed to sleep for three
weeks you will go mad. Why? Sleep is useless. Why will you go mad if you
are not allowed to sleep for three weeks? A man can live without food
for three months but a man cannot live without sleep for three weeks.
And three weeks is the ultimate limit. It is not for you – you will go
mad within three days if you are not allowed to sleep. If the useless is
thrown out, you will go mad.</p><p>Madness is growing every day because meditation is not thought to be
valuable. Do you think that whatsoever can be priced, only that is
valuable? whatsoever can be purchased and sold, only that is valuable?
whatsoever is a market commodity, only that is valuable? Then you are
wrong. That which has no price is also valuable. That which cannot be
sold and purchased is far more valuable than all that can be purchased
and sold.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is the basis of sex. If you deprive people of love completely,
sex becomes perverted. Meditation is the basis of mind. If you deny
meditation, the mind goes mad. Fun, play, is the basis of work. If you
deny fun and play, work becomes a burden, a dead weight.</p><p>Look at the useless sky. Your house may be useful but it exists in
this vast sky of uselessness. If you can feel both, and if you become
able to move from one to the other without any trouble, then for the
first time the perfect human being is born in you.</p><p><br></p><p>The perfect human being does not know what is inside and what is out
– both are his. The perfect human being does not bother about what is
useful and what is useless – both are his wings. The perfect human being
flies in the sky with both the wings of mind and meditation, of matter
and consciousness, of this world and that, of God, of no God. He is a
higher harmony of the opposites.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu emphasized no-use so much, uselessness so much, because
you have emphasized the useful too much. Otherwise that emphasis is not
needed. It is just to give you balance. You have gone too much to the
left, you have to be pulled to the right.</p><p><br></p><p>But remember, because of this over-emphasis you can again move to the
other extreme. And that happened to many followers of Chuang Tzu. They
became addicted to the useless, they became mad with the useless. They
moved too much towards the useless and that was not the point – they
missed it.</p><p>Chuang Tzu emphasized this only because you have become so extremely
addicted to use. That is why he emphasized the useless. But I must
remind you – because mind can move to the opposite and remain the same –
that the real thing is transcendence. You have to come to a point where
you can use the useful and the non-useful, the purposeful and the
purposeless. Then you are beyond both, they both serve you.</p><p>There are persons who cannot get rid of their mind and there are
persons who cannot get rid of their meditation. And remember, it is the
same disease: you cannot get rid of something. First you were unable to
get rid of the mind, then somehow you managed it; now you cannot get rid
of the meditation. Again you move from one prison to another.</p><p>A real, a perfect man, a man of Tao, has no addictions. He can move
easily from one extreme to another because he remains in the middle. He
uses both wings.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu should not be misunderstood, that is why I say this. He
can be misunderstood. People like Chuang Tzu are dangerous because you
can misunderstand them. And there is more possibility for
misunderstanding than understanding. The mind says, “Okay, so enough of
this shop, enough of this family; now I will become a vagabond.” That is
misunderstanding. You will carry the same mind, you will become addicted
to your vagabondness. Then you will not be able to come back to the
shop, to the market, to the family. Then you will be afraid of it.</p><p><br></p><p>In the same way, medicine can become a new disease if you get
addicted to it. So the doctor has to see that you get rid of the disease
but don’t become addicted to the medicine – otherwise he is not a good
doctor. First you have to get rid of the disease, and immediately after
you have to get rid of the medicine; otherwise the medicine will take
the place of the disease and you will cling to it always.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin was teaching his small son, who was seven years old,
how to approach a girl, how to ask her to dance, what to say and what
not to say, how to persuade her.</p><p>The boy went away and half an hour later came back and said, “Now
teach me how to get rid of her!”</p><p><br></p><p>That has to be learned too, and that is the difficult part. To invite
is very easy but to get rid of is very difficult. And you know well
through your own experience: to invite a girl is always easy, to
persuade a girl is always easy, but how to get rid of her? Then it
becomes a problem. Then you don’t go out anywhere, then you forget
whistling completely.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, the useless has its own attraction. If you are so very
troubled by the useful, you may move to the other extreme too much. You
may lose your balance.</p><p><br></p><p>To me, a sannyasin is a deep balance, standing in the middle, free
from all the opposites. He can use the useful and he can use the
non-useful, he can use the purposeful and the nonpurposeful, and still
remain beyond both. He is not used by them. He has become the
master.</p><p><br></p><p>Enough for today.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s3>9</span></p><p><br></p><p>Means and Ends</p><p><br></p><p>18 July 1974 am in Buddha Hall</p><p><br></p><p>THE PURPOSE OF A FISH TRAP IS TO CATCH FISH,</p><p>AND WHEN THE FISH ARE CAUGHT THE TRAP IS FORGOTTEN.</p><p>THE PURPOSE OF WORDS IS TO CONVEY IDEAS.</p><p>WHEN THE IDEAS ARE GRASPED THE WORDS ARE FORGOTTEN. WHERE CAN I FIND
A MAN</p><p>WHO HAS FORGOTTEN WORDS?</p><p><br></p><p>HE IS THE ONE</p><p><br></p><p>I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO.</p><p><br></p><p>It is difficult to forget words. They cling to the mind. It is
difficult to throw away the net because not only are fish caught in it,
the fisher is also caught. This is one of the greatest problems. Working
with words is playing with fire, because words become so important that
the meaning loses meaning. The symbol becomes so heavy that the content
is completely lost; the surface hypnotizes you and you forget the
center.</p><p>This has happened all over the world. Christ is the content,
Christianity is just a word; Buddha is the content, DHAMMAPADA is just a
word; Krishna is the content, the Gita is nothing but a trap. But the
Gita is remembered and Krishna is forgotten – or if you remember
Krishna, you remember him only because of the Gita. If you talk about
Christ it is because of the churches, the theology, The Bible, the
words. People carry the net for many lives without realizing that it is
just a net, a trap.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha used to tell a story:</p><p>A few men were crossing a river. The river was dangerous, in flood –
it must have been the rainy season – and the boat saved their lives.
They must have been very, very intelligent because they thought, “This
boat saved us, how can we leave it now? This is our savior and it will
be ungrateful to leave it!” So they carried the boat on their heads into
the town.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody asked them, “What are you doing? We have never seen anybody
carrying a boat.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “Now we will have to carry this boat for the rest of our
lives, because this boat saved us and we cannot be ungrateful.”</p><p><br></p><p>Those intelligent-looking people must have been stupid. Thank the
boat but leave it there. Don’t carry it. You have been carrying many
types of boats in your head – maybe not on your head, but in your head.
Look within. Ladders, boats, paths, words – this is the content of your
head, of your mind.</p><p>The container becomes much too important, the vehicle becomes much
too important, the body becomes much too important – and then you become
a blind man. The vehicle was just to give you the message – receive the
message and forget the vehicle. The messenger was just to give you the
message – receive the message and forget the messenger. Thank him, but
don’t carry him in your head.</p><p><br></p><p>Mohammed insisted again and again, almost every day of his life, “I
am just a messenger, a PAIGAMBER. Don’t worship me, I have only carried
a message from the divine. Don’t look at me, look at the divine who has
sent the message to you.” But Mohammedans have forgotten the source.
Mohammed has become important, the vehicle.</p><p><br></p><p>Says Chuang Tzu:</p><p>WHERE CAN I FIND A MAN</p><p><br></p><p>WHO HAS FORGOTTEN WORDS? HE IS THE ONE</p><p><br></p><p>I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO.</p><p><br></p><p>A man who has forgotten words, he is worth talking to, because he has
the innermost reality, the center of being within him. He has the
message. His silence is pregnant. Your talking is impotent. What are you
doing when you talk? You are not saying anything in particular. You have
got no message, nothing is to be delivered. Your words are empty, they
don’t contain anything, they don’t carry anything. They are just
symbols. And when you are talking you are simply throwing out your
rubbish. It may be a good catharsis for you, but it can be dangerous for
the other. And how can you talk with a person who is filled with words?
Impossible. The words don’t leave room. The words don’t give a door, an
opening. The words are too much, you cannot penetrate.</p><p><br></p><p>To talk with a man who is filled with words is almost impossible. He
cannot listen, because for listening one should be silent, for listening
one should be receptive. Words don’t allow that – words are aggressive,
they are never receptive. You can talk but you cannot listen, and if you
cannot listen, your talk is the talk of a madman. You are talking not
knowing why, you are talking not knowing what. You go on talking because
it gives you a sort of release.</p><p>You feel good after having a good chitchat. You feel good because you
are relieved: your talking is part of your tensions. It is not coming
from you, it is just a disturbance; it is not a song, it has no beauty
of its own. That is why whenever you talk you simply bore the other. But
why is he listening? He is not listening, he is just waiting to bore
you, just waiting for the right moment when he can take the reins in his
hands.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard, it happened once that a great politician, a leader, was
speaking, and he spoke and spoke and it was getting near midnight. By
and by the audience left until only one person was left in the hall. The
leader thanked him and said, “You seem to be the only lover of truth,
the only authentic follower. I feel grateful. When everyone else has
left, you are still here.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “Don’t be deceived, I am the next speaker.”</p><p><br></p><p>When you listen, you are listening because you are the next speaker.
You can tolerate the man – this is a bargain. If you want to bore others
you have to allow them to bore you. Really, when you say that a certain
person is a bore, you mean that the person will not give you any
opportunity to be the next speaker. He goes on and on and you cannot
find a gap from where you can enter to start boring. That person looks
like a bore to you, but every mind filled with words is a bore.</p><p>When will you realize this? Why is a person bored? – because there
are only words, no fish in them, only traps...useless, meaningless,
there is no content. It is like a rattling of something, a noise; no
meaning is carried. Whenever there is meaning it is beautiful; whenever
there is meaning you grow through it; whenever there is meaning, when
you encounter a man who has meaning, it gives you a new upsurge of
energy. It is not a wastage, it is a learning, it is an experience. Rare
and difficult it is to find a man who is silent.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can find a man who is silent and persuade him to talk to you,
you will gain much – because when the mind is not filled with words, the
heart speaks to the heart. When everything comes out of silence, when a
word is born out of silence, it is beautiful, it is alive, it shares
something with you. When a word comes only out of the crowd of words, it
is mad, it can madden you.</p><p><br></p><p>A small boy of five was asked by his teacher, “Has your younger
sister learned to talk yet?” The boy said, “Yes, she has learned to talk
– and now we are teaching her to be quiet.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the misery. You have to teach words, it is part of life, and
then you have to learn how to be silent, and how to be wordless.
Universities, parents, teachers, they teach you words, and then you have
to find a master who can teach you how to keep quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>A German scholar came to Ramana Maharshi and said, “I have come from
very far away to learn something from you.”</p><p>Ramana laughed and said, “Then you have come to the wrong place. Go
to some university, some scholar, some great pundit; there you will be
able to learn. If you come to me then be aware that learning is not
possible here, we teach only unlearning. I can teach you how to unlearn,
how to throw words away, to create space within you. And that space is
divine, that space is God.”</p><p>Where are you seeking? In words, in scriptures? Then one day or other
you will become an atheist. A pundit, a scholar, cannot remain a theist
for long. Remember, howsoever he knows, whatsoever he knows about The
Bible and the Gita and the Koran, a scholar is bound to become an
atheist one day because that is the logical consequence of gathering
words. Sooner or later he will ask: Where is God? No Bible can reply, no
Gita can supply the answer. Rather, Bibles and Gitas and Korans, when
they are too much on your mind, will make you miss the divine because
the whole of your mind space is filled...there is too much furniture in
you. God cannot move. God may not be able to make any contact with you
if the mind is too wordy. Then it is impossible to listen, and if you
cannot listen, how can you pray? It is impossible to wait, words are too
impatient, they are knocking from within to get out.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard:</p><p>Once it happened that at three o’clock one morning Mulla Nasruddin
phoned the bartender and said, “What time is the bar going to open?”</p><p><br></p><p>The bartender said, “This is no time to inquire such a thing. You are
a regular customer, Nasruddin,</p><p>and you know that we don’t open before nine in the morning. Go back
to sleep and wait until nine.”</p><p><br></p><p>But ten minutes later he phoned again and said, “This is urgent. Tell
me when the bar is going to open.”</p><p>Now the bartender felt annoyed. He said, “What do you think you are
doing? I told you not a single</p><p>minute before nine. And don’t keep phoning me.”</p><p><br></p><p>But ten minutes later he phoned again. The bartender said, “Have you
gone mad? You will have to</p><p>wait until nine.</p><p>Nasruddin said, “You don’t understand. I am locked in the saloon and
I want to get out!”</p><p><br></p><p>If your mind is too burdened with words, theories, scriptures, they
will keep knocking: Give way, we want to get out! And when the mind
wants to get out, God cannot enter in you. When the mind</p><p><br></p><p>wants to get out, it is not open for anything that is incoming. It is
closed, it is a one-way traffic –</p><p>double traffic is not possible.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are aggressive through words going out, nothing can
penetrate you, neither love, nor meditation, nor God. And all that is
beautiful happens as an ingoing process. When you are silent, no words
knocking within to get out, when you are waiting – in that moment of
waiting beauty happens, love happens, prayer happens, God happens. But
if a man is too addicted to words, he will miss it all. In the end he
will have a long collection of words and theories, logic, everything –
but nothing is worthwhile because the content is missing.</p><p><br></p><p>You have the net, the trap, but no fish are there. If you had really
caught the fish you would have thrown away the net immediately. Who
bothers? If you have really used the ladder, you forget it. Who thinks
about it? You have transcended it, it has been used.</p><p>So whenever a man really comes to know, knowledge is forgotten. That
is what we call wisdom. A wise man is one who has been able to unlearn
the knowledge. He simply drops all that is nonessential.</p><p><br></p><p>Says Chuang Tzu:</p><p><br></p><p>WHERE CAN I FIND A MAN</p><p><br></p><p>WHO HAS FORGOTTEN WORDS?</p><p><br></p><p>HE IS THE ONE I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO.</p><p>He is worth talking to. It may not be so easy to persuade him to
talk, but just to be near him, just to sit by his side will be a
communion, will be a communication, the deepest that is possible. Two
hearts will melt into each other.</p><p><br></p><p>But why this addiction to words? – because the symbol appears to be
the real. And if it is repeated again and again, through repetition you
become autohypnotized. Repeat anything, and by and by you will forget
that you don’t know. The repetition will give you the feeling that you
know.</p><p><br></p><p>If you go to the temple for the first time, you go in ignorance. It
is hypothetical whether this temple really contains anything, whether
God is there or not. But go every day, again and again, and go on
repeating the ritual, the prayers; and whatsoever the priest says, go on
doing it day after day, year after year. You will forget the
hypothetical state of mind that was there in the beginning. With
continuous repetitions the thing goes into the mind and you start
feeling that this is the temple, God lives here, this is the abode of
God. Now you have moved into the world of appearance.</p><p>That is why every religion insists on teaching children as young as
possible, because once you miss childhood it is very difficult to
convert people to foolish things, very difficult. Psychologists say that
everybody should be caught before the age of seven. The child can be
conditioned to be a Hindu, a Mohammedan, a Christian or anything, a
communist, theist or atheist, it doesn’t make any difference – but grab
the child before seven. Up to the age of seven the child learns almost
fifty percent of all he will ever learn in his whole life.</p><p><br></p><p>And this fifty percent is very meaningful because it becomes the
base. He will learn many things, he will create a great structure of
knowledge, but all that structure will be based on the knowledge that he
received when he was a child. And at this time, before the age of seven,
the child has got no logic, no argumentativeness. He is trusting,
exploring; he is believing. He cannot disbelieve, because he does not
know what belief, what disbelief, is.</p><p>When the child is born, he has no mind to argue. He does not know
what argument is. Whatsoever you say appears true to him, and if you
repeat it the child is hypnotized. That is how all the religions have
exploited humanity. The child has to be forced to conform to a pattern,
and once the pattern is deeply rooted, nothing can be done. Even if
later on the child changes his religion, nothing much will change. On
the contrary, his Christianity will be just like Hinduism, because of
the base.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened, there was once a tribe of cannibals near the Amazon. By
and by, they killed most of their own members until only two hundred or
so remained. They had killed and eaten each other. A missionary went
there to work. The chief of the tribe spoke to him in perfect English.
The missionary was surprised and said, “What! You speak such perfect
English, and with a perfect Oxford accent, but you are still a
cannibal?”</p><p>The man said, “Yes, I have been to Oxford, and I have learned much.
Yes, we are still cannibals, but</p><p>now I use a knife and fork. I have learned that at Oxford.”</p><p><br></p><p>This much change happens – nothing much. Convert a Hindu to
Christianity and his Christianity will be just like Hinduism. Convert a
Christian to Hinduism; he will remain a Christian deep down, because you
cannot change the base. You cannot make him a child again, you cannot
make him innocent. That moment is lost.</p><p><br></p><p>If this earth is ever going to be really religious then we will not
teach Christianity, Hinduism, Mohammedanism, Buddhism: that is one of
the greatest crimes committed. We will teach prayer, we will teach
meditation, but not sects. We will not teach words and beliefs, we will
teach a way of life, we will teach happiness, we will teach ecstasy. We
will teach how to look at the trees, how to dance with the trees, how to
be more sensitive, how to be more alive and how to enjoy the blessings
that God has given...but not words, not beliefs, not philosophies, not
theologies. No, we will not lead them to a church or to a temple or to a
mosque, because these places are the sources of corruption. They have
corrupted the mind. We will leave the children to nature; that is the
temple, the real church.</p><p><br></p><p>We will teach children to look at the floating clouds, at the rising
sun, at the moon at night. We will teach them how to love, and we will
teach them not to create barriers against love, meditation, prayer; we
will teach them to be open and vulnerable, we will not close their
minds. And we will of course teach words but simultaneously we will
teach silence, because once words get into the base, silence becomes
difficult.</p><p>You come to me, your problem is this: at the base there are words and
now you are trying to meditate and be silent – and the base is always
there. Whenever you are silent the base starts functioning. So you
become aware of too much thinking when you meditate – even more than you
feel ordinarily. Why? What is happening? When you are silent you go
inwards and you become more sensitive to the inner nonsense that goes on
and on. When you are not in meditation you are outward-going,</p><p><br></p><p>extrovert; you are involved with the world and you cannot listen to
the inner noise that goes on. Your mind is not there.</p><p>The noise is continuously there but you cannot hear it, you are
occupied. But whenever you close your eyes and look within, the madhouse
opens. You can see and feel and hear, and then you become afraid and
scared. What is happening? And you thought that through meditation you
would become more silent! And this is happening – just the opposite!</p><p><br></p><p>In the beginning it is bound to happen because a wrong base has been
given to you. The whole society, your parents, your teachers, your
universities, your culture, have given you a wrong base. You have
already been corrupted, your source is poisoned. That is the problem –
how to depoison you. It takes time, and one of the most difficult things
is to get rid of all that you have known, to unlearn.</p><p>Says Chuang Tzu:</p><p><br></p><p>WHERE CAN I FIND A MAN</p><p><br></p><p>WHO HAS FORGOTTEN WORDS? HE IS THE ONE</p><p>I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO.</p><p><br></p><p>Only a sage is worth talking to. Only a sage is worth listening to.
Only a sage is worth living with.</p><p>What is a sage? An empty boat – no words inside, the empty sky
without the clouds. No sound, no noise, nobody mad, no chaos within, a
continuous harmony, equilibrium, balance. He lives as if he is not. He
is as if he is absent. He moves, but nothing moves within him. He talks,
but the inner silence is there. It is never disturbed; he uses words,
but those words are only vehicles – through those words he is sending
you something which is beyond words. And if you catch and grab the
words, you will miss.</p><p><br></p><p>When you listen to a sage, don’t listen to his words; they are
secondary, they are superficial, they are only peripheral. Listen to
him, don’t listen to his words. When the words reach you, just put them
aside, as the traveler will do who has crossed the sea – he leaves the
boat there and goes on. Leave the boat there and go on. If you carry the
boat, you are mad. Then your whole life will become a burden, you are
burdened by the boat. A boat is not to be carried on the head. Feel
grateful, that is okay, but carrying the boat on your head is too
much.</p><p><br></p><p>How many boats are you carrying on your head? Your whole life has
become static because of the weight. You cannot fly, you cannot float,
because you are carrying such a dead burden, not only from one life,
this life, but from many lives. You go on collecting all that is
useless, futile. Why does this happen? There must be some deep reason,
otherwise everybody would not be doing it.</p><p>Why does it happen? In the first place, you think the word is the
reality – the word god is God, the word love is love – the word is real.
The word is NOT the real. You have to make a distinction, a</p><p><br></p><p>clear-cut distinction, that the word is not the real. The word only
symbolizes, indicates; it is not the real. Once you are trapped into
believing that the word is the real, then when someone says, “I love
you,” you will be frustrated. Because he says he loves you, you believe
he loves you – for you the word is the real.</p><p>If you cannot see the wordless reality you will be frustrated in all
your paths in life, everywhere you will be frustrated because you will
take the word for reality.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people come to me and say, “This girl loved me, she said it
herself.” “This man loved me and now the love has disappeared.” They
were both deceived by words.</p><p>Dale Carnegie suggests that even if you have been married for twenty
years, don’t forget to keep using the same words you used when you were
courting your wife – continue. Every morning say the same as you did
when you were courting. Don’t drop those words. Every day say, “Nobody
exists like you. You are the most beautiful person in the world, and I
will die without you.” Dale Carnegie says that even if you don’t feel
it, go on saying it, because words are realities. And the wife will be
deceived and the husband will be deceived, because we live by words
alone.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t know anything else, you don’t know anything real. How can
you be in contact with reality? When someone says, “I love you” –
finished! When someone says, “I hate you” – finished! Put aside the
words and look at the person. When someone says, “I love you,” don’t get
entangled with the words, put them aside. Look at the person, at his or
her totality. Then nobody can deceive you. Love is such a fire you will
be able to see it, you will be able to touch it, you will be able to
know whether it is there or not.</p><p><br></p><p>Love cannot be hidden. If it is there, really, words are not needed.
When somebody really loves you, he will not say, “I love you.” It is not
needed. Love is enough unto itself – it needs no salesmanship. It
doesn’t need anybody to persuade, to convince; it is enough, it is a
fire. Nothing is more fiery than love, it is a flame. And when there is
a flame in the dark you need not say anything about it. It is there. No
advertisement is needed, no propaganda is needed.</p><p>Try to separate words from reality. In your day-to-day life when
someone says, “I hate you,” don’t believe the word. This may be just a
momentary thing, it may be just a phase. Don’t go for the word,
otherwise you will make an enemy for life. As you have made friends
because of words so you have made enemies because of words. Don’t go for
the words, look into the person, look into the eyes, feel the whole – it
may be just a momentary reaction. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred it
will be just a momentary thing. He feels hurt by something, he reacts
and says, “I hate you.” Wait, don’t decide, don’t say, “This is an
enemy.” If you say that, you are not only deceived by others’ words, you
are also deceived by your own. If you say, “This is an enemy,” now this
word will cling. And even if he changes tomorrow, you will not be so
ready or so willing to change, you will carry it within you. And then
through your insistence you will create an enemy. Your enemies are
false, your friends are false, because words are not reality.</p><p><br></p><p>Words can do only one thing: if you go on repeating them they give
you the appearance of reality. Says Adolf Hitler in his autobiography,
Mein Kampf: I know only one difference between the truth and the lie –
that is, a lie repeated many times becomes true. And he knows by
experience, he says that he did it – he continuously repeated lies, and
went on and on repeating them.</p><p><br></p><p>In the beginning they looked foolish. He started saying that it was
because of the Jews that Germany was defeated in the first world war. It
was absolutely absurd.</p><p>Once he was speaking at a meeting and he asked, “Who is responsible
for the defeat of Germany?” One man stood up and said, “The bicycle
riders.”</p><p>Hitler was surprised. He said, “What? Why?”</p><p>The man said, “Then why the Jews?” He was a Jew. Why Jews?</p><p><br></p><p>Even when Hitler was dying and again Germany had been defeated and
completely destroyed, he didn’t believe that it was because of Stalin,
Churchill and Roosevelt. He didn’t believe that he was defeated because
his enemies were superior, more powerful than him. His last verdict was
still the same: that it was a Jewish conspiracy, that the Jews were in
the background working and because of them the Germans had been
defeated. And the whole of Germany believed him – one of the most
intelligent peoples on the earth!</p><p><br></p><p>But intelligent people can be stupid because intelligent people
always believe in words. That is the problem. The Germans, highly
intelligent, highly scholarly people, have produced the greatest
professors, philosophers; the whole country is intelligent. How could
such a stupid man as Adolf Hitler persuade them that his arguments were
logical?</p><p>But this COULD happen there because a land of professors,
intelligentsia, so-called intellectuals, is always word-addicted. If you
go on repeating a word again and again and again, hammering and
hammering, people listening again and again start feeling that this is
true. Truth can be created out of lies if you go on repeating them.
Repeti-tion is the method to convert a lie into a truth. But can you
convert a lie into a truth? Just in appearance you can. Try it. Go on
repeating something and you will start believing it. It may be that you
are not as miserable as you look. Because you have been repeating, “I am
in misery, I am in misery, I am in misery,” and you have repeated it so
often, now you look miserable.</p><p><br></p><p>Just look into your misery. Are you really miserable? Are you really
in such hell as you show by your face? Have a second thought.
Immed-iately you will not feel so miserable because nobody can be as
miserable as you look. It is impossible. God doesn’t allow it! It is
repetition, it is autohypnosis.</p><p>A French psychologist, Emile Coue, used to treat people. His method
was simply repetition, suggestion, autohypnosis. You could go to him and
say, “I have a headache, a constant headache, and no medicine helps. I
have tried all the ‘pathies,’ even naturopathy, and nothing helps.”</p><p><br></p><p>He would say that there was no need of treatment because there was no
headache. You have simply believed in it. And in going to this doctor
and that, all have helped you to believe that yes, a headache is there –
because if they don’t believe in your headache they cannot live. Doctors
cannot say that you don’t have a headache. When you go to a doctor, even
if you have nothing wrong he will find something. A doctor exists by
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Talking with Coue would help you immediately, almost fifty percent of
the headache would disappear just by talking to him – without any
medicine. And he would feel the relaxation coming over your face</p><p><br></p><p>and then he would know that the trick had worked. Then he would give
you a formula that you had to repeat continuously day and night,
whenever you remembered – that there was no headache. Every morning when
you got up you had to repeat: “I am getting better and better every
day.” And within two or three weeks the headache would disappear.</p><p>A real headache cannot disappear that way. In the first place the
headache was created by words; in the first place, you hypnotized
yourself that you had a headache, and then you dehypnotized yourself. A
real illness cannot disappear. But your illnesses – ninety percent of
them – are unreal. Through words you have created them. Coue helped
thousands, Mesmer helped thousands, just by creating the feeling that
you are not ill. It doesn’t show that autohypnosis cures illness; it
only shows that you are such great autohypnotists already that you
CREATE illnesses! You believe in them.</p><p><br></p><p>And doctors cannot say that your diseases are mental. You don’t feel
good if someone says that your disease is mental, you feel very bad, and
you immediately change your doctor. Whenever a doctor says that you have
a very great disease, very serious, you feel very good – because a man
like you, so great, a somebody, he MUST have a big disease! Small
diseases are for small people, ordinary diseases for ordinary people.
When you have cancer, tb, or something dangerous, you feel superior, you
are somebody. At least as far as illness is concerned you are not
ordinary.</p><p>A doctor who had just graduated from college, returned to his home.
His father was also a doctor – very tired from working and working, so
he went on a holiday. He said, “I need at least three weeks’ rest and I
am going to the hills, so you can take over my work.”</p><p><br></p><p>When the father came back three weeks later the son said, “I have a
surprise for you. The lady you have been treating for years and couldn’t
cure, I cured her in three days.”</p><p>The father beat him on the head and said, “You fool, that lady was
paying for your education and I was hoping that through her all my
children would get through college. Her stomachache was not real. And I
was worried when I was in the hills because I forgot to tell you not to
touch her. She is rich and she needs a stomachache, and I have been
helping her. For years she has been the source of our income.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ninety percent of all diseases are psychological. They can be cured
by mantra, they can be cured by suggestion, they can be cured by Satya
Sai Baba, because in the first place you have already performed the real
miracle in creating them. Now anyone can cure them.</p><p>Continuously repeating a word creates the reality, but this reality
is hallucinatory. It is illusion, and you cannot come to reality until
all words have disappeared from the mind. Even a single word may create
illusion. Words are great forces. If even a single word is in the mind,
your mind is not empty. Whatsoever you are seeing, feeling, is through
the word, and that word will change the reality.</p><p>You have to be completely wordless, thoughtless. You have to be just
consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are just consciousness then the boat is empty and reality is
revealed to you. Because you are not repeating anything or you are not
imagining anything, you are not autohypnotizing yourself. Only then the
real appears, revealed.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu is right. He says:</p><p><br></p><p>WHERE CAN I FIND THE MAN</p><p><br></p><p>WHO HAS FORGOTTEN WORDS? HE IS THE ONE</p><p>I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO. THE PURPOSE OF A FISH TRAP IS TO CATCH
FISH.…</p><p>You have forgotten the purpose completely. You have gathered so many
fish traps and are so constantly worried about them – that somebody
might steal them, that they might get broken or go rotten – that you
have completely forgotten the fish!</p><p>THE PURPOSE OF A FISH TRAP IS TO CATCH FISH,</p><p>AND WHEN THE FISH ARE CAUGHT THE TRAP IS FORGOTTEN.</p><p>If you cannot forget the trap it means that the fish is not yet
caught. Remember, if you are continuously obsessed with the trap, it
shows that the fishes are not yet caught. You have forgotten completely
about them and become so entangled with the fish traps that you have
fallen in love with them!</p><p><br></p><p>Once I had a neighbor, a professor, a man of words. He purchased a
car. Every morning he worked on cleaning it. It always stayed in
showroom condition, and he never took it on the road. For years I
watched. Every morning he would take much trouble, cleaning, polishing
it.</p><p>Once we were traveling in the same railway compartment, so I asked,
“Is something wrong with the car? You never bring it out. It is always
in your drive.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “No, I have fallen in love with it. I love it so much that I
am always afraid that if I take it out something may go wrong – an
accident, a scratch, anything can go wrong. And it is unbearable even to
think of it.”</p><p><br></p><p>A car, a word, a trap, they are means not ends. You can fall in love
with them and then you never use them.</p><p>I used to stay in a house. The lady of the house had three hundred
sarees but she always used two – she was preserving the others for some
special occasion. When will that special occasion come? As far as I
know, and I have known her for fifteen years, that special occasion has
not come yet. It is not going to come, because she is growing older
every day; sooner or later she will die and those three hundred sarees
will live on.</p><p><br></p><p>What happened? Fallen in love with sarees? You CAN fall in love with
things. It is difficult to fall in love with persons, it is very easy to
fall in love with things because things are dead, you can manipulate
them. Sarees will never say, “Wear us! We would like to go out and have
a look around.” The car will never say, “Drive me, I am getting
bored.”</p><p>With persons it is difficult. They will demand, they will ask, they
would like to go out, they have their own desires to be fulfilled. When
you fall in love with a person there is always conflict, so those who
are clever never fall in love with persons, they always fall in love
with things: a house, a car, clothes. They are always easy, manageable,
and you always remain the master and the other never creates trouble.
Or, if you fall in love with a person, you immediately try to convert
him into a thing, a dead thing. A wife is a dead thing, a husband is a
dead thing, and they torture each other. Why do they torture each other?
What is the point of it? Through torture they make the other dead so the
other becomes a thing, manipulatable. Then they are not worried.</p><p>Two matrons were looking at a bookshop window. One said to the other,
“Look, there is a book entitled How to Torture Your Husband.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the other was not interested. She didn’t even look at the book –
she said, “I don’t need it, I have</p><p>a system of my own.”</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody has his own system of torturing the other, because only
through torture and destruction can a person be changed into a
thing.</p><p>It happened once that Mulla Nasruddin walked into the coffee house
looking very angry, very aggressive and dangerous, and he said, “I hear
that someone has called my wife an ugly old hag. Who is this guy?”</p><p><br></p><p>A man stood up, a very tall, strong, giantlike man. He said, “I said
that about your wife, and what about it?”</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at the person, Nasruddin immediately calmed down; he was
dangerous. He went up to him and said, “Thank you, this is my feeling
too, but I couldn’t gather the courage to say so. You have done it, you
are a brave man.”</p><p><br></p><p>What happens in a relationship? Why does it always turn ugly? Why is
it so impossible to love? Why does everything become poisoned?
...Because the mind is always happy to manipulate things, because things
never rebel: they are always obedient, they never disobey. A person is
alive, you cannot predict what he is going to do. And you cannot
manipulate...the other’s freedom becomes the problem.</p><p>Love is such a problem because you cannot allow the other the freedom
to be. And remember this: if you really love, real love is possible only
when you allow the other total freedom to be himself or herself. But
then you cannot possess, then you cannot predict, then you cannot be
secure, then everything has to move moment to moment. And mind wants to
plan, to be secure and safe.</p><p>Mind wants life to run along a track because mind is the most dead
thing in you. It is as if you are a river and a part of the river is an
iceberg. Your mind is just like the iceberg, it is the frozen part
of</p><p><br></p><p>you, and it wants to make you completely frozen so that then there
will be no fear. Whenever there is the new, there is fear – with the old
there is no fear. Mind is always happy with the old.</p><p>That is why mind is always orthodox, never revolutionary. There has
never been a mind which can be called revolutionary. Mind cannot be
revolutionary. Buddha is revolutionary, Chuang Tzu is revolutionary –
because they have no minds. Lenin is not revolutionary, Stalin
absolutely not. They cannot be. With minds, how can you be
revolutionary? Mind is always orthodox, mind is always conforming,
because mind is the dead part in you. This has to be understood.</p><p>There are many dead parts in you for the body to throw out. Your hair
is dead, that is why you can cut it easily and there is no pain. Your
nails are dead, that is why you can cut them easily and there is no
pain, no hurt. The body goes on throwing them off. Consciousness also
has to throw off many things, otherwise they will accumulate. Mind is
the dead part like the hair. And this is symbolic. Buddha told his
disciples to shave their heads just as a symbol: as you shave your hair
completely, so you shave the inner consciousness also, you shave it
completely of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Both hair and mind are dead, don’t carry them. It is beautiful! Don’t
allow the dead part to accumulate. What is mind? Your past experiences,
your learning, all that has been. Mind is never present – how can it be?
Here and now, mind cannot be.</p><p><br></p><p>If you simply look at me, where is the mind? If you simply sit here
and listen to me, where is the mind? If you start arguing, the mind
comes in; if you start judging, the mind comes in. But how do you judge?
You bring the past to the present, the past becomes the judge of the
present. How do you argue? You bring up the past as an argument, and
when you bring up the past, the mind comes in.</p><p>Mind is the dead part of you, it is the excreta. And just as there
are constipated people who suffer very much, so there is mind
constipation, accumulated excreta. You never throw it out. In your mind,
things only go in; you never throw out.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is throwing the mind out, unburdening yourself. The
excreta must not be carried, otherwise you will become duller and
duller. That is why a child has a fresh mind – because it has no
accumulation. So sometimes children can say things that your
philosophers cannot say. Sometimes they look and penetrate into
realities that your man of knowledge misses. Children are very, very
penetrating. They have a clarity, their look is fresh, their eyes are
not filled. A sage is again a child. He has emptied his boat, he has
emptied himself of all the cargo. The excreta has been thrown out, he is
not constipated. His consciousness is a flow, it has no frozen
parts.</p><p>THE PURPOSE OF A FISH TRAP IS TO CATCH FISH,</p><p>AND WHEN THE FISH ARE CAUGHT THE TRAP IS FORGOTTEN.</p><p>THE PURPOSE OF WORDS</p><p><br></p><p>IS TO CONVEY IDEAS.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN THE IDEAS ARE GRASPED THE WORDS ARE FORGOTTEN.</p><p>If you really understand me, you will not be able to remember what I
said. You will catch the fish but you will drop the trap. You will be
what I said but you will not remember what I said. You will be
transformed through it but you will not become a more learned man
through it. You will be more empty through it, less filled; you will go
away from me refreshed, not burdened.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t try to gather what I say because whatsoever you gather will be
wrong. Gathering is wrong: don’t accumulate, don’t fill your treasure
chest from my words. Words are excreta, they are not worth anything.
Throw them out, then the meaning will be there, and meaning does not
have to be remembered; it never becomes part of the memory, it becomes
part of your wholeness. You have to remember a thing only when it is
part of the memory, just of the intellect. You never need to remember a
real thing that has happened to you. If it happens to you, it is there –
what is the need to remember? Don’t repeat, because repetition will give
you a false notion.</p><p>Listen, but not to the words – just by the side of the words the
wordless is being given to you. Don’t be too focused on the words, just
look a little sideways also because the real thing is being given there.
Don’t listen to what I say, listen to me! I am also here, not only the
words. And once you listen to me, then all words will be forgotten.</p><p>Buddha died, and the bhikkhus, the disciples, were very disturbed
because none of his sayings had been collected while he was alive. They
completely forgot to record his words and did not think that he would
die so soon, so suddenly. Disciples never think of that – that the
master may disappear suddenly.</p><p><br></p><p>Then suddenly one day Buddha said, “I am going.” There was no time
left and he had been speaking for forty years. When he was dead, how
could his words be collected? A treasure would be lost, but what was
there to do?</p><p><br></p><p>And it is beautiful that Mahakashyapa could not repeat Buddha’s
words. He said, “I heard him, but I don’t remember what he said. I was
so much in it, it never became part of my memory, I don’t know.” And he
had become enlightened!</p><p><br></p><p>Sariputta, Moggalyan, all these who had become enlightened, shrugged
their shoulders and said, “It is difficult, he has said so much, but we
do not remember it.” And these were the disciples who had reached.</p><p>Then Ananda was approached. He had not become enlightened while
Buddha was alive; when Buddha died, then he became enlightened. He had
remembered everything. He dictated word by word the contents of the
forty years he was with Buddha. He dictated word by word – a man who was
not enlightened! It looks like a paradox. Those who had reached should
have remembered, not this man who had not yet reached the other shore.
But when the other shore is reached, this shore is forgotten, and when
one has oneself become a buddha, who cares to remember what Buddha
said?</p><p><br></p><p>THE PURPOSE OF A FISH TRAP</p><p><br></p><p>IS TO CATCH FISH,</p><p><br></p><p>AND WHEN THE FISH ARE CAUGHT THE TRAP IS FORGOTTEN.</p><p>The words of the Buddha were traps, Mahakashyapa caught the fish. Who
bothers about the trap now? Where the boat has gone, who bothers? He has
crossed the stream. Mahakashyapa said, “I don’t know what this fellow
said. And you cannot rely on me, because with me it is difficult to
separate what he said and what I say.”</p><p>Of course it will be so. When Mahakashyapa has become a buddha
himself, how can they be separate? The two are not two. But Ananda said,
“I will relate his words,” and very authentically he related. Humanity
is in great debt to this fellow Ananda who was still ignorant. He had
not caught the fish so he remembered the trap. He was still thinking
about catching the fish so he had to carry the trap.</p><p>THE PURPOSE OF WORDS IS TO CONVEY IDEAS.</p><p>WHEN THE IDEAS ARE GRASPED THE WORDS ARE FORGOTTEN.</p><p>Remember this as a basic law of life – that the useless, the
meaningless, the peripheral, looks so significant because you are not
aware of the center. This world looks so significant because you are not
aware of God. When the God is known, the world is forgotten. And it is
never otherwise.</p><p><br></p><p>People have tried to forget the world so that they can know God – it
has never happened and it will never happen. You can go on trying and
trying to forget the world, but you cannot. Your every effort to forget
will become a continuous remembering. Only when God is known is the
world forgotten. You can go on struggling to drop thinking, but you
cannot drop thinking unless consciousness is achieved. Thinking is a
substitute. How can you drop the trap when the fish is not yet caught?
The mind will say, “Don’t be foolish. Where is the fish?”</p><p><br></p><p>How can you drop the words when you have not realized the meaning?
Don’t fight with the words, try to reach to the meaning. Don’t try to
fight with thoughts. That is why I insist again and again that if
thoughts disturb you, don’t create any struggle with them, don’t wrestle
with them. If they come, let them come. If they go, let them go. Don’t
do anything, just be indifferent, just be a watcher, an onlooker, not
concerned. That is all that you can do right now – not be concerned.</p><p>Don’t say, “Don’t come.” Don’t invite, don’t reject, don’t condemn
and don’t appreciate. Simply remain indifferent. Look at them, they come
as clouds float in the sky – then they go, as clouds disappear. Let them
come and go, don’t come in their way, don’t pay attention to them. If
you are against them</p><p><br></p><p>then you start paying them attention, and then immediately you are
disturbed: “My meditation is lost.” Nothing is lost. Meditation is your
intrinsic nature. Nothing is lost. Is the sky lost when clouds come?
Nothing is lost.</p><p>Be indifferent, don’t be bothered by thoughts, this way or that. And
sooner or later you will feel and you will realize that their coming and
going has become slower. Sooner or later you will come to see that now
they come, but not so much; sometimes the traffic stops, the road is
vacant. One thought has passed, another has not come yet; there is an
interval. In that interval you will know your inner sky in its absolute
glory. But if a thought enters, let it enter; don’t get disturbed.</p><p><br></p><p>You can do this much, and only this much can be done; nothing else is
possible. Be inattentive, indifferent, not caring. Just remain a
witness, watching, not interfering, and the mind will go, because
nothing can be retained inside if you are indifferent.</p><p>Indifference is cutting the roots, the very roots. Don’t feel
antagonistic because that is again feeding. If you have to remember
friends, you have to remember enemies even more so. Friends you can
forget, how can you forget enemies? You have to constantly remember them
because you are afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>People are disturbed by thoughts, ordinary people. Religious people
are disturbed more because they are constantly fighting. But through
fighting you pay attention – and attention is food. Everything grows if
you pay attention, grows fast, becomes more vital. You just be
indifferent.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha used the word UPEKSHA; it means absolute indifference, neither
this nor that – just in the middle – neither friendly nor inimical,
neither for nor against, just in the middle, looking as if you are not
concerned, as if these thoughts don’t belong to you, as if they are part
of the great world. Let them be there. Then one day suddenly, when the
indifference is total, the consciousness shifts from the periphery to
the center.</p><p>But it cannot be predicted and cannot be planned: one has to go on
working and waiting. Whenever it happens, you can laugh: those thoughts
were there because you wanted them to be there, those thoughts were
there because you were feeding them continuously, and those thoughts
were there because the fish was not yet caught. How could you throw away
the trap? You had to carry it.</p><p>I remember that once it happened in Mulla Nasruddin’s country that
the king was in search of a wise man. His old wise man had died saying,
“When you replace me, find the man who is the most humble in the
kingdom, because ego is anti-wisdom. Humility is wisdom, so find the
most humble man.”</p><p><br></p><p>Secret agents were sent all over the kingdom to spy out the most
humble man. Finally they reached Nasruddin’s village. He had heard the
news that the wise man was dead, so he thought hard about what might be
the indication of a wise man. He had read, and he knew the ancient lore
that the humblest is the most wise. So he logically inferred, concluded,
that the old man must have said to find the humblest man.</p><p><br></p><p>Then came the king’s men in search. Mulla Nasruddin was very rich,
but when they saw him, the richest man in the town, he was carrying a
fishing net, coming from the river. Fishing was the humblest job in the
town. So they thought, “This man seems to be very humble,” and they
asked Nasruddin, “Why do you carry this fishing net? You are so rich,
you need not go on fishing.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin said, “I became this rich through fishing. I started my
life as a fisherman. I have become rich, but just to pay respect to the
original profession that gave me so much, I always carry this net on my
shoulder.”</p><p>A really humble man. Generally, if a poor man becomes rich he starts
wiping his whole past clean so that nobody knows that he was ever a poor
man. He drops all contacts which show that once he was a poor man. He
doesn’t want to see his relatives, he doesn’t want to be reminded of the
past. He simply drops the past completely. He creates a new past as if
he is a born aristocrat. But this man was humble. So the messengers
informed the king that Mulla Nasruddin was the humblest man they had
ever seen and he was appointed the wise man.</p><p>The day he was appointed, he threw away the net. The men who had
recommended him asked,</p><p>“Nasruddin, where is your net now?”</p><p>He said, “When the fish is caught, the net is thrown away.”</p><p><br></p><p>But you cannot throw it away before – it is impossible, you have to
carry it. But carry it indifferently. Don’t get attached, don’t fall in
love with it, because one day it has to be thrown away. If you fall in
love with it then you may never catch the fish, you will be just afraid
that if you catch the fish you will have to throw away the net.</p><p>Don’t fall in love with the mind. It has to be used and it is there
because you don’t know the no-mind yet, you don’t know the innermost
core of your being. The periphery is there and you have to carry it but
carry it indifferently. Don’t become a victim of it.</p><p><br></p><p>One story more:</p><p>There was a man who used to go to the race course every year on his
birthday. The whole year he accumulated the money just for one stake on
his birthday. And he lost and lost for many years. But hope always
revives again and again! Each time he went he decided never to go
again...but one year is such a long time! For a few days he would
remember and then again hope returned. He thought, “Who knows, this year
I may become rich so why not one more try?”</p><p>By the time his birthday came round he was again ready to go to the
race course. And it was his</p><p>fiftieth birthday, so he thought, “I should try wholeheartedly.”</p><p>So he sold all his possessions, gathered a small fortune, all that he
had earned in his whole life, all that he had, and he said, “Now I have
to decide this way or that. Either I am to become a beggar or an
emperor; no more in the middle, enough!”</p><p>He went there, to the windows, and looked at the names of the horses
and saw a horse named Adolf Hitler. He thought, “It will do well. Such a
great man, such a victorious man, he threatened the whole world. This
horse must be ferocious and strong.” So he staked all, and he lost – as
all those who stake on Hitlers will lose. Now he had nowhere to go, even
his house was lost. So there was nothing left to do but commit
suicide.</p><p>So he went to a cliff, just to jump and finish it all. When he was
about to jump he suddenly heard a voice, and he couldn’t tell whether it
came from the outside or from the inside. It said, “Stop! Next time I
will give you the name of the winner – one more try. Don’t kill
yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hope revived, he came back. He worked hard that year, because it was
going to be the victory for which he had been waiting all his life. The
dream had to be fulfilled. He worked hard day and night, he earned much.
Then with a trembling heart he reached the window and waited. The voice
said, “Okay, choose this horse Churchill.” Without any argument, without
thinking about it, without his mind coming in, he staked all and won.
Churchill came first.</p><p>He went back to the window, and waited. The voice said, “Now back
Stalin.” He staked all. Stalin</p><p>came in first. Now he had a big treasure.</p><p>The third time he waited, and the voice said, “No more.”</p><p><br></p><p>But he said, “Keep quiet, I am winning, my stars are high and nobody
can defeat me now.” So he</p><p>chose Nixon and Nixon came last.</p><p>All his treasure lost, he was again a beggar. Standing there, he
muttered to himself, “Now what shall I</p><p>do?”</p><p><br></p><p>Said the inner voice, “Now you can go to the cliff and jump!”</p><p>In moments when you are going to die, the mind stops because there is
nothing for it to work on. The mind is part of life, it is not part of
death. When there is no more life ahead, mind stops; there is no work,
it is unemployed immediately. And when mind stops, the inner voice comes
in. It is always there, but the mind is creating so much noise that a
still small voice cannot be heard.</p><p><br></p><p>The voice had not come from beyond, there is nobody beyond,
everything is within. The God is not in the skies, it is in you. He was
going to die – the last decision taken by the mind. But when the mind
retired, because there was now no more work, suddenly he heard the
voice. This voice came from his innermost core, and the voice that comes
from the innermost core is always right.</p><p><br></p><p>Then what happened? Twice the voice worked, but then the mind entered
again and the mind said,</p><p>“Don’t listen to such nonsense, the stars are high and we are
winning.”</p><p><br></p><p>Remember this: whenever you win, you win because of the inner voice.
But the mind always comes in and takes charge. Whenever you feel
happiness it is always from the inner. Then mind immediately jumps in
and takes control and says, “It is because of me.” When you are in love,
love becomes like death, you feel blissful. Then immediately mind comes
in and says, “Okay, this is me, this is because of me.”</p><p>Whenever you meditate, there are glimpses. Then the mind comes in and
says, “Be happy! Look, I have done it.” And immediately the contact is
lost.</p><p>Remember this: with mind you will always be a loser. Even if you are
victorious, your victories will be just defeats. With mind there is no
victory; with no-mind there is no defeat.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to shift your whole consciousness from mind to no-mind. Once
no-mind is there, everything is victorious. Once the no-mind is there,
nothing goes wrong, nothing CAN go wrong. With no-mind everything is
absolutely as it should be. One is content, not a single fragment of
discontent remains, one is absolutely at home. You are an outsider
because of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>This shift is possible only if you become indifferent; otherwise this
shift will never be possible. Even if you have glimpses, those glimpses
will be lost. You have had glimpses before – it is not only in prayer
and meditation that glimpses happen. Glimpses happen in ordinary life
too. Making love to a woman, the mind stops. That is why sex is so
appealing: it is a natural ecstasy. For a single moment suddenly mind is
not there, you feel blissful and content – but only for a single moment.
Immediately the mind comes in and starts working on how to get more, how
to stay longer. Planning, controlling, manipulating comes in, and you
have missed.</p><p>Sometimes, without any reason or rhyme, you are walking down the
street under the trees and suddenly a sunray comes and falls on you, a
breeze touches your face. Suddenly it is as if the whole world has
changed and for a single moment you are ecstatic. What was happening?
You were walking, unworried, not going somewhere, just having a walk, a
morning or evening walk. In that relaxed moment, suddenly, without your
knowing, consciousness shifted from the mind to the no-mind. Immediately
there is beatitude. But the mind comes in and says, “I must get more and
more moments like this.” Then you can stand there for years, for lives,
but it will never happen again. It never happened because of the
mind.</p><p><br></p><p>In ordinary day-to-day life, not only in temples, in shops and
offices also, the moments come – the consciousness shifts from the
periphery to the center. But the mind controls again immediately. Mind
is the great controller. You may be the master but he is the manager,
and the manager has absorbed so much control and power that the manager
thinks he is the master. And the master is completely forgotten.</p><p>Be indifferent to mind. Whenever moments come which are wordless,
silent, if the mind comes in, don’t help and don’t cooperate with it.
Just look. Let it say whatsoever it says, don’t pay much attention. It
will withdraw.</p><p><br></p><p>In meditation, moments happen every day to you. Many come to me and
say, “It happened on the first day but since then it has not been
happening.”</p><p><br></p><p>Why did it happen on the first day? You are more prepared now, on the
first day you were not so prepared. Why did it happen on the first day?
It happened on the first day because the manager was unaware of what was
going to happen. He couldn’t plan. The next day the manager knows well
what is to be done: breathing fast, then crying, screaming, then Hoo,
Hoo. Now the manager knows, and the manager does it. Then the moment
will not happen, the manager has taken charge.</p><p>Remember this: whenever a blissful moment happens, don’t ask for it
again. Don’t ask for it to be repeated, because all repetition is of
mind. Don’t ask for it again. If you ask, then the mind will say, “I
know the trick. I will do it for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>When it happens, feel happy and grateful and forget. The fish is
caught, forget the trap. The meaning is caught, forget the word.</p><p>And the last thing: whenever meditation is complete, you will forget
meditation. And only then, when you forget meditation, will it have come
to a fulfillment, will the climax have been reached. Now you are
meditative for twenty-four hours a day. It is nothing to be done; it is
there, it is you, it is your being.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can do this, then meditation becomes a continuous flow, not an
effort on your part – because all effort is of the mind.</p><p>If meditation becomes your natural life, your spontaneous life, your
Tao, then I tell you, some day Chuang Tzu will catch hold of you.
Because he asks:</p><p>WHERE CAN I FIND A MAN</p><p><br></p><p>WHO HAS FORGOTTEN WORDS? HE IS THE ONE</p><p>I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO.</p><p>He is searching. I have seen him here many times wandering around
you, just waiting, waiting. If you forget the words he will talk to you.
And not only Chuang Tzu – Krishna, Christ, Lao Tzu, Buddha, they are all
in search of you; all the enlightened people are in search of the
ignorant. But they cannot talk because they know a language which is of
silence, and you know a language which is of madness. They cannot lead
anywhere. They are in search. All the buddhas that have ever existed are
in search. Whenever you are silent you will feel that they have always
been all around you.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that whenever the disciple is ready the master appears.
Whenever you are ready the truth will be delivered to you. There is not
even a single moment’s gap. Whenever you are ready, it happens
immediately. There is no time gap.</p><p>Remember Chuang Tzu. Any moment he may start talking to you, but
before he starts talking, your talking must go.</p><p><br></p><p>Enough for today.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s7>1 0</span></p><p><br></p><p>Wholeness</p><p><br></p><p>19 July 1974 am in Buddha Hall</p><p><br></p><p>HOW DOES THE TRUE MAN OF TAO</p><p><br></p><p>WALK THROUGH WALLS WITHOUT OBSTRUCTION AND STAND IN FIRE WITHOUT

DOES THE TRUE MAN OF TAO – WALK THROUGH WALLS WITHOUT OBSTRUCTION</h2><p>AND STAND IN FIRE WITHOUT BEING BURNT?</p><p>This is one of the most basic and secret teachings. Ordinarily we
live through cunningness, cleverness and strategy; we don’t live like
small children, innocent. We plan, we protect, we make all the
safeguards possible – but what is the result? Ultimately, what happens?
All the safeguards are broken, all cunningness proves foolishness –
ultimately death takes us away.</p><p><br></p><p>Tao says that your cunningness will not help you, because what is it
but a fight against the whole? With whom are you cunning – with nature,
with Tao, with God? Whom do you think you are deceiving – the source
from where you are born and the source to which you will finally go? Is
the wave trying to deceive the ocean, is the leaf trying to deceive the
tree, is a cloud trying to deceive the sky? Whom do you think you are
trying to deceive? With whom are you playing?</p><p><br></p><p>Once it is understood, a man becomes innocent, drops his cunningness,
all strategies, and simply accepts. There is no other way than to accept
nature as it is and to flow with it. Then there is no resistance, then
he is just like a child who is going with his father, in deep trust.</p><p><br></p><p>Once, Mulla Nasruddin’s son came home and said that he had trusted a
friend and had given him his</p><p>toy to play with, but now the friend refused to return it. “What
should I do?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin looked at him and said, “Go up this ladder.” The boy
did so, he trusted his father.</p><p>When he was ten feet high, Nasruddin said, “Now jump into my arms.”
The boy hesitated a little, and said, “If I fall, I will get hurt.”</p><p>Nasruddin said, “When I am here, you need notworry. Take ajump.” The
boyjumped, and Nasruddin</p><p>stood aside. The boy fell down, and started crying and weeping.</p><p><br></p><p>Then Nasruddin said, “Now you know. Never believe anybody, not even
what your father says: don’t even believe your father.”</p><p>Don’t believe in anybody, otherwise you will be deceived all your
life. This is what every father, every parent, every school, every
teacher, teaches you. This is your learning. Don’t believe in anybody,
don’t trust, otherwise you will be deceived. You become cunning. In the
name of cleverness you become cunning, untrusting. And once a man is
untrusting he has lost contact with the source.</p><p><br></p><p>Trust is the only bridge, otherwise your whole life is wasted; you
fight an impossible fight in which defeat is bound to happen, it is
absolutely certain. It is better to realize it now, because at the
moment of death everybody realizes that it has been a defeat. But then
nothing can be done.</p><p><br></p><p>Real intelligence is not cunningness, it is totally different. Real
intelligence is to look into things And</p><p>whenever you look into things deeply, you will come to know that you
are just a wave, that this whole is the ocean and there is no need to
worry. The whole has produced you, it will take care of you. You have
come out of the whole, it is no enemy to you. You need not worry, you
need not plan. And when you are not worried, not planning, for the first
time life starts. For the first time you feel free of worries, and life
happens to you.</p><p>This intelligence is religion. This intelligence gives you more
trust, and finally, total trust. This intelligence leads you to the
ultimate nature, acceptance – what Buddha called TATHATA. Buddha said:
What-soever happens, happens. Nothing else can happen, nothing else is
possible. Don’t ask for it to be otherwise; be in a letgo, and allow the
whole to function. And when you allow the whole to function and you are
not a barrier, a resistance, then you cannot be defeated.</p><p>In Japan, through Buddha, Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu, a particular art
has been developed called ZENDO. Zendo means the Zen of the sword, the
art of the warrior – and nobody knows it like they do. The way they have
developed it is supreme. It takes years, even a whole lifetime, to learn
zendo because the learning consists in acceptance. You cannot accept in
ordinary life – how can you accept when a warrior is standing before
you, waiting to kill you? How can you accept when the sword is raised
against you and every moment, any moment, death is near?</p><p><br></p><p>The art of zendo says that if you can accept the sword, the enemy,
the one who is going to kill you, and there is no distrust; if even the
enemy is the friend, and you are not afraid, not trembling, then you
become a pillar of energy, unbreakable. The sword will break on you, but
you cannot be broken. There will not even be any possibility that you
could be destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>Once there was a great zendo master. He was eighty, and
tradition-ally, the disciple who could defeat him would succeed him. So
all the disciples hoped that someday he would accept their challenge,
because now he was getting old.</p><p>There was one disciple who was the cleverest, the best strategist,
very powerful, but not a master of zendo, just skilled in the art.
Although he was a good warrior and he knew everything about
swordsmanship, he was not yet a pillar of energy, he was still afraid
while fighting. The tathata had not yet happened to him.</p><p><br></p><p>He went to the master again and again saying, “Now the time has come,
and you are getting old. Soon you will be too old to challenge at all. I
challenge you now. Accept my challenge, Master, and give me a chance to
show what I have learned from you.” The master laughed and avoided
him.</p><p><br></p><p>The disciple started thinking that the master had become so weak and
old that he was afraid, just trying to evade the challenge. So one night
he insisted and insisted and got angry and said, “I will not leave until
you accept my challenge. Tomorrow morning you have to accept. You are
getting old and soon there will be no chance for me to show what I have
learned from you. This has been a tradition always.”</p><p>The master said, “If you insist, your very insistence shows that you
are not ready or prepared. There is too much excitement in you, your ego
wants to challenge, you have not yet become capable; but if you insist,
okay. Do one thing. Go to the nearby monastery where there is a monk who
was my disciple ten years ago. He became so efficient in zendo that he
threw away his sword and became a sannyasin. He was my rightful
successor. He never challenged me, and he was the only one who could
have challenged and even defeated me. So first go and challenge that
monk. If you can defeat him, then come to me. If you cannot defeat him,
then just drop the idea.”</p><p><br></p><p>The disciple immediately started out for the monastery. By morning he
was there. He challenged the monk. He couldn’t believe that this monk
could be a zendo master – lean and thin, continuously meditating, eating
only once a day. The monk listened and laughed, and he said, “You have
come to give me a challenge? Even your master cannot challenge me, even
he is afraid.”</p><p><br></p><p>Listening to this, the disciple got completely mad! He said, “Stand
up immediately! Here is a sword I have brought for you knowing well that
you are a monk and might not have one. Come out in the garden. This is
insulting, and I will not listen.”</p><p>The monk looked absolutely undisturbed. He said, “You are just a
child, you are not a warrior. You will be killed immediately. Why are
you asking for death unnecessarily?”</p><p><br></p><p>That made him still more angry so they both went out. The monk said,
“I will not need the sword, because a real master never needs it. I am
not going to attack you, I am only going to give you a chance to attack
me so your sword is broken. You are not a match for me. You are a child,
and people will laugh at me if I take up the sword against you.”</p><p>It was too much! The young man jumped up – but then he saw that the
monk was standing. Up until now the monk had been sitting; now he stood
up, closed his eyes, and started swaying from side to side – and
suddenly the young man saw that the monk had disappeared. There was only
a pillar of</p><p><br></p><p>energy – no face, just a solid pillar of energy, swaying. He became
afraid and started retreating, and the pillar of energy started moving
towards him, swaying. He threw away his sword and screamed at the top of
his voice, “Save me!”</p><p>The monk sat down again and started laughing. His face came back, the
energy disappeared, and he</p><p>said, “I told you before: even your master is no match for me. Go and
tell him.”</p><p><br></p><p>Perspiring, trembling, nervous, the disciple went back to his master
and said, “How grateful I am for your compassion towards me. I am no
match for you. Even that monk destroyed me completely. But one thing I
couldn’t tolerate, that is why I got involved in it. He said, ‘Even your
master is not a match for me.’”</p><p><br></p><p>The master started laughing and he said, “So that rascal played the
trick on you too? You got angry? Then he could see through you, because
anger is a hole in the being. And that has become his basic trick.
Whenever I send somebody to him, he starts talking against me, and my
disciples of course become angry. When they are angry, he finds out that
they have loopholes, and when you have holes you cannot fight.”</p><p>Whenever you are angry, your being has leakages. Whenever you desire,
your being has holes in it. Whenever you are jealous, filled with
hatred, sexuality, you are not a pillar of energy. Hence buddhas have
been teaching us to be desireless, because whenever you are desireless
energy does not move outwards, energy moves within. It becomes an inner
circle, it becomes an electric field, a bioelectric field. When that
field is there, without any leakage, you are a pillar; you cannot be
defeated. But you are not thinking of victory, remember, because if you
are thinking of victory you cannot be a pillar of energy. Then that
desire becomes a leakage.</p><p>You are weak, not because others are strong, you are weak because you
are filled with so many desires. You are defeated, not because others
are more cunning and clever – you are defeated because you have so many
leakages.</p><p><br></p><p>Tathata – acceptance, total acceptance, means no desire. Desire
arises out of nonacceptance. You cannot accept a certain situation, so
desire arises. You live in a hut and you cannot accept it; this is too
much for the ego, you want a palace – then you are a poor man, but not
because you live in a hut, no. In huts, emperors have lived. Buddha has
lived under a tree, and he was not a poor man. You cannot find a richer
man anywhere.</p><p>No, your hut doesn’t make you poor. The moment you desire the palace
you are a poor man. And you are not poor because others are living in
palaces, you are poor because the desire to live in the palace creates a
comparison with the hut. You become envious. You are poor.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever there is discontent, there is poverty; whenever there is no
discontent, you are rich. And you have such riches that no thief can
steal them; you have such riches, no government can take them by
taxation; you have riches which cannot be taken away from you in any
way. You have a fort for your being, unbreakable, impenetrable.</p><p>Once a desire moves and your energy starts falling you become weak
through desire, you become weak through longing. Whenever you are not
longing and are content, whenever nothing is moving,</p><p><br></p><p>when your whole being is still, then, says Chuang Tzu, you are an
impenetrable fort. Fire cannot burn you, death is impossible. That is
the meaning of: Fire cannot burn you; death is impossible, you cannot
die. You have got the secret key of eternal life.</p><p>And sometimes this happens in ordinary circumstances too. A house is
on fire – everybody dies but a small child survives. There is an
accident – the old people die and the small children survive. People say
that this is a miracle, God’s grace. No, it is nothing of the sort, it
is because the child accepted that situation too. Those who were cunning
started running and trying to save themselves; they got themselves into
trouble. The child rested. He was not even aware that anything was
happening, that he was going to die. The child is saved through his
innocence.</p><p><br></p><p>It happens every day. Go and observe at night near a bar, a wine
shop, drunkards falling down in the street, lying in the gutter,
absolutely happy. In the morning they will get up. They may be bruised a
little but no harm has happened to their bodies. Their bones are intact.
They have got no fractures.</p><p><br></p><p>You try to fall like a drunkard on the street – immediately you will
have fractures. And he falls like this every day, every night, many
times, but nothing happens to him. What is the matter, what is the
secret? When he is drunk there is no desire. He is absolutely at ease,
here and now. When he is drunk he is not afraid, there is no fear, and
when there is no fear, there is no cunningness.</p><p><br></p><p>Cunningness comes out of fear. So the more fearful a person, the more
cunningness you will find in him. A brave man is not cunning, he can
depend on his bravery; but a man who is afraid, who is a coward, can
depend only on cunningness. The more inferior a person, the more
cunning. The more superior a person, the more innocent. Cunningness is a
substitute. When one is drunk, absolutely drunk, future disappears and
past disappears.</p><p>I have heard: Once it happened that Mulla Nasruddin was walking along
with his wife, absolutely drunk. She had found him lying in the street
and was bringing him home. Of course, as usual, she was arguing, and
winning all the arguments, because she was alone. Mulla Nasrud-din was
not there; he was simply coming along with her.</p><p><br></p><p>Then suddenly she saw a mad bull approaching. There was no time to
warn Nasruddin, so she jumped into a bush. The bull came up and spun
Nasruddin almost fifty feet in the air. He fell into a ditch, and as he
crawled out of it he looked at his wife and said, “If you do this to me
again, I shall really lose my temper. This is too much!”</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinary wine gives so much power when one is drunk, what about Tao,
the absolute drunkenness? What about Krishna or Buddha, the greatest
drunkards – so drunk with the divine that not even a trace of the ego is
left? You cannot hurt them because they are not there, you cannot insult
them because there is no one who will resist the insult and create a
wound. Your insult will pass through them, as if passing through an
empty house. Their boats are empty. A breeze comes in and passes with no
barrier. When the breeze has gone the house is not even aware that the
breeze has been there.</p><p><br></p><p>The appeal of wine is really because you are so egoistic. You are too
burdened by it and sometimes you want to forget it. So the world will
have to follow alcohol or Tao – these are the alternatives. Only a
religious man, a really religious man, can be beyond alcohol, marijuana,
lsd – any type of drug.</p><p><br></p><p>Only a religious man can be beyond them; otherwise how can you be
beyond them? The ego is too much, the burden is too much, it is
constantly on your head. You HAVE to forget yourselves.</p><p>But if wine can do so much, you cannot conceive of what the divine
wine can do. What is the wine doing? For certain moments, through
chemical changes in the brain, in the body, you forget yourself. But
this is momentary. Deep down you are there, and after a few hours the
chemical effect is gone, your body has thrown the wine out and the ego
asserts itself again.</p><p><br></p><p>But there is a wine, I tell you – God is that wine, Tao, or
whatsoever name you like to call it. Once you taste it, the ego is gone
forever. Nobody ever comes back from that drunkenness.</p><p>That is why Sufis always talk of wine, Sufis always talk of women.
Their woman is not the woman you know – God is the woman. And their wine
is not the wine that you know – God is the wine. Omar Khayyam has been
misunderstood, tremendously misunderstood; because of Fitzgerald he has
been misunderstood all over the world. Omar Khayyam’s Rubaiyat appears
to be written in praise of wine and women, but it is not at all. Omar
Khayyam is a Sufi, a mystic. He talks of the wine which comes through
Tao; he talks of the wine in which you are lost forever and forever.
This intoxicant, this divine intoxicant, is not temporary, it is
nontemporal, not momentary – it is eternal.</p><p><br></p><p>And Sufis talk of God as the woman. That embrace is eternal, it is
ultimate; then there is no separation. If you can understand this then
you are intelligent, but not through your strategies, cunningness,
arithmetic, your logic.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can, look deep into existence. From where have you come? Where
are you going? With whom are you fighting, and why? These same moments
that you are losing in fighting can become ecstatic. Now look at the
sutra: Wholeness.</p><p><br></p><p>You think of yourself as the individual. You are wrong. Only the
whole exists. This is false – this appearance that: I think I am. This
is the most false thing in the world. And because of this “I am,” fight
arises. If I am, then this whole seems inimical; then everything seems
to be against me.</p><p>It is not that anything is against you – it cannot be! These trees
have helped you, this sky has helped you, this water has helped you,
this earth created you. Then nature is your mother. How can the mother
be against you? You have come out of her. But you think I am as an
individual, and then the fight arises. It is one-sided. You start the
fight, and nature goes on laughing, God goes on enjoying. Even in a
small child, the moment he starts feeling I, the fight arises.</p><p><br></p><p>In a supermarket, a small child was insisting on a toy. The mother
said positively, “No, I am not going to buy it. You have got
enough.”</p><p><br></p><p>The child got angry and said, “Mum, I have never seen a meaner girl
than you, you are the meanest.”</p><p><br></p><p>The mother looked at the child, at his face, the anger on it, and she
said, “Just wait, you will certainly meet a really mean girl. Just
wait!”</p><p>In one house, the mother was insisting that the child do his
homework. He was not listening and</p><p>went on playing with his toys, so she said, “Are you listening to me
or not?”</p><p><br></p><p>The child looked up and said, “Who do you think I am – Daddy?”</p><p><br></p><p>Only a small child, and the fighting starts – the ego has arisen. He
knows Daddy can be silenced, but not him. The moment the child feels he
is separate the natural unity is broken, and then his whole life becomes
a struggle and fight.</p><p><br></p><p>Western psychology insists that the ego should be strengthened. That
is the difference between the Eastern attitude and the Western. Western
psychology insists that the ego should be strengthened; the child must
have a strong ego, he must fight, struggle, only then will he be
mature.</p><p>The child is in the mother’s womb, one with the mother, not even
aware that he is – he is, without any consciousness. In a deep sense all
consciousness is illness. Not that he is unconscious – he IS aware. His
being is there, but without any self-consciousness. The am is there, but
the I has not been born yet. The child feels, lives, is fully alive, but
never feels that he is separate. The mother and the child are one.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the child is born. The first separation happens, and the first
cry. Now he is moving, the wave is moving away from the ocean. Western
psychologists say: We will train the child to be independent, to be
individual. Jung’s psychology is known as the way of individu-ation. He
must become an individual, absolutely separate. He must fight. That is
why, in the West, there is so much rebellion in the younger generation.
This rebellion was not created by the younger generation, this rebellion
was created by Freud, Jung, Adler and company. They have given the
basis.</p><p><br></p><p>Fight will give you a stronger ego. It will shape you. So fight the
mother, fight the father, fight the teacher, fight the society. Life is
struggle. And Darwin started the whole trend when he said only the
fittest survive; life means survival of the fittest. So the stronger you
are in your ego, the more chance you will have of surviving.</p><p><br></p><p>The West lives through politics, the East has a totally different
attitude...and Tao is the core, the very essence of the Eastern
consciousness. It says: No individuality, no ego, no fight; become one
with the mother; there is no enemy, the question is not of
conquering.</p><p>Even a man, a very knowledgeable man, a very penetrating, logical man
like Bertrand Russell, thinks in terms of conquest – conquering nature,
the conquest of nature. Science seems to be a struggle, a fight with
nature: how to break the lock, how to open the secrets, how to grab the
secrets from nature.</p><p><br></p><p>Eastern consciousness is totally different. Eastern consciousness
says: Ego is the problem, don’t make it stronger, don’t create any
fight. And not the fittest but the humblest survive.</p><p>That is why I insist again and again that Jesus is from the East;
that is why he could not be understood in the West. The West has
misunderstood him. The East could have understood him because the East
knows Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu, Buddha, and Jesus belongs to them. He says:
Those who are last will be the first in my kingdom of God. The humblest,
the meekest, will possess the kingdom of God. The poor in spirit is the
goal. Who is poor in spirit? The empty boat, he who is not at all – no
claim on anything, no possession of anything, no self. He lives as an
absence.</p><p><br></p><p>Nature gives her secrets. There is no need to grab, there is no need
to kill, there is no need to break the lock. Love nature, and nature
gives you her secrets. Love is the key. Conquering is absurd.</p><p>So what has happened in the West? This conquering has destroyed the
whole of nature. So now there is a cry for ecology, how to restore the
balance. We have destroyed nature completely, because we have broken all
the locks and we have destroyed the whole balance. And now through that
imbalance humanity will die sooner or later.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu can be understood now, because he says: Don’t fight with
nature. Be in such deep love, become so one that through love, from
heart to heart, the secret is given. And the secret is that you are not
the individual, you are the whole. And why be satisfied with just being
a part? Why not be the whole? Why not possess the whole universe? Why
possess small things?</p><p><br></p><p>Ramateertha used to say, “When I close my eyes I see stars moving
within me, sun rising within me,</p><p>moon rising within me. I see oceans and skies. I am the vast, I am
the whole universe.”</p><p><br></p><p>When for the first time he went to the West and started saying these
things, people thought he had</p><p>gone crazy. Somebody asked him, “Who created the world?” He said, “I,
it is within me.”</p><p>This I is not the ego, not the individual; this I is the universe,
God. He looks crazy. This claim looks too much. But look in his eyes:
there is no ego. He is not asserting anything, he is simply stating a
fact.</p><p><br></p><p>You are the world! Why be a part, a tiny part, and why unnecessarily
create trouble when you can be the whole?</p><p>This sutra is concerned with wholeness. Don’t be the individual, be
the whole. Don’t be the ego.</p><p>When you can become the divine, why be satisfied with such a small,
tiny, ugly thing? HOW DOES THE TRUE MAN OF TAO</p><p>WALK THROUGH WALLS WITHOUT OBSTRUCTION AND STAND IN FIRE WITHOUT
BEING BURNT?</p><p>Someone asked Chuang Tzu, “We have heard that a man of Tao can walk
through walls without obstruction. Why?” If you don’t have any
obstruction within you, no obstruction can obstruct you. This is the
rule. If you have no resistance within you, in your heart, the whole
world is open for you. There is no resistance. The world is just a
reflection, it is a big mirror; if you have resistance, then the whole
world has resistance.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened once that a king built a great palace, a palace of
millions of mirrors – all the walls were covered with mirrors. A dog
entered the palace and he saw millions of dogs all around him. So, being
a very intelligent dog, he started barking to protect himself from the
millions of dogs all around him. His life was in danger. He must have
become tense, he started barking. And when he started barking, those
millions of dogs started barking too.</p><p><br></p><p>In the morning the dog was found dead. And he was there alone, there
were only mirrors. Nobody was fighting with him, nobody was there to
fight, but he looked at himself in the mirror and became afraid. And
when he started fighting, the mirror reflection also started fighting.
He was alone, with millions and millions of dogs around him. Can you
imagine the hell he lived through that night?</p><p>You are living in that hell right now; millions and millions of dogs
are barking around you. In every mirror, in every relationship, you see
the enemy. A man of Tao can walk through the walls because he has no
wall in his heart. A man of Tao finds nowhere the enemy because he is
not the enemy inside. A man of Tao finds all mirrors vacant, all boats
empty, because his own boat is empty. He is mirrored, he has no face of
his own, so how can you mirror, how can you reflect a man of Tao? All
mirrors keep silent. A man of Tao passes – no footprints are left
behind, no trace. All mirrors remain silent. Nothing reflects him,
because he is not there, he is absent.</p><p><br></p><p>When the ego disappears you are absent, and then you are whole. When
the ego is there you are present, and you are just a tiny part, a very
tiny part, and very ugly at that. The part will always be ugly. That is
why we have to try to make it beautiful in so many ways. But a man with
ego cannot be beautiful. Beauty happens only to those who are without
egos. Then the beauty has something of the unknown in it, something
immeasurable.</p><p>Remember this: ugliness can be measured. It has limits. Beauty, the
so-called beauty, can be measured. It has limits. But the real beauty
cannot be measured – it has no limits. It is mysterious – it goes on and
on and on. You cannot be finished with a buddha. You can enter him, and
you will never come out. Endless! His beauty is never finished.</p><p><br></p><p>But the ego goes on trying to be beautiful. Somehow you remember the
beauty of the whole; somehow you remember the silence of the womb;
somehow deep down you know the bliss of being one, the union, the unity
with existence. Because of that, many desires arise. You know the beauty
of being a god and you have to live like a beggar. So what do you do?
You create faces, you paint yourself. But deep down the ugliness
remains, because all paints are just paints.</p><p>It happened once that a woman was walking on the seashore. She found
a bottle, opened it, and a genie came out. And, like all true genies,
this genie said, “You have broken my prison, you have set me free. So
now you can ask anything, and I will fulfill your fondest desire or
wish.”</p><p><br></p><p>Genies are not found every day, on every shore, in every bottle. It
rarely happens, and only in stories. But the woman didn’t think even for
a single moment. She said, “I want to become a beautiful person – hair
like Elizabeth Taylor, eyes like Brigitte Bardot, body like Sophia
Loren.”</p><p>The genie looked again, and said, “Honey, put me back in the
bottle!”</p><p><br></p><p>And this is what you are all asking for – everybody is asking for
this – this is why genies have disappeared from the world. They are so
afraid of you, you are asking the impossible. It cannot happen because
the part can never be beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>Just think: my hand can be cut off – can that hand be beautiful? It
will grow more and more ugly, it will deteriorate, it will start
smelling. How can my hand be beautiful, separate from me? The separation
brings death; unison brings life. In the whole you are alive; alone,
separate, you are already dead or dying.</p><p><br></p><p>My eyes, take them out, then what are they? Even stones, colored
stones, will be more beautiful than they because they are still with the
whole. Pluck a flower; then it is not beautiful, the glory is gone. It
was beautiful just a moment ago when it was joined with the roots, with
the earth. Uprooted, you float like egos. You are ill, and you will
remain ill, and nothing can be of any help. All your efforts, however
clever, are going to fail.</p><p>Only in the whole are you beautiful. Only in the whole are you
lovely.</p><p>Only in the whole is grace possible.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not because of cunningness that the man of Tao walks through
walls without obstruction, and stands in fire without being burnt. It
is:</p><p>NOT BECAUSE OF CUNNING OR DARING, AND NOT BECAUSE HE HAS LEARNED –
BUT BECAUSE HE HAS UNLEARNED.</p><p>Learning goes into the ego; learning strengthens the ego. That is why
pundits, brahmins, scholars, have the subtlest egos. Learning gives them
scope, learning gives them space. They become tumors, egos. Their whole
being is then exploited by the ego.</p><p><br></p><p>The more learned a man, the more difficult he is to live with, the
more difficult he is to relate to, the more difficult it is for him to
reach the temple. It is almost impossible for him to know God because he
himself now lives like a tumor, and the tumor has its own life – now it
is the ego tumor. And it exploits. The more you know, the less
possibility there is for prayer to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>So, says Chuang Tzu, it is not because of cunningness; he is not
calculating, he is not cunning or daring, because daring, cunning,
calculating, are all part of the ego. A man of Tao is neither a coward
nor a brave man. He does not know what bravery is, what cowardice is. He
lives. He is not self-conscious, not because he has learned but because
he has unlearned. The whole of religion is a process of unlearning.
Learning is the process of the ego, unlearning is the process of the
non- ego. Learned, your boat is full, filled with yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened that Mulla Nasruddin used to have a ferryboat, and when
times were not good he would carry passengers from one bank to the
other.</p><p><br></p><p>One day a great scholar, a grammarian, a pundit, was crossing in his
ferryboat to the other shore.</p><p>The pundit asked Nasruddin, “Do you know the Koran? Have you learned
the scriptures?” Nasruddin said, “No, no time.”</p><p>The scholar said, “Half your life has been wasted.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then suddenly there arose a storm and the small boat was far from the
shore. At any moment it</p><p>would sink. Asked Nasruddin, “Schoolmaster, do you know how to swim?”
The man was very afraid, perspiring. He said, “No.”</p><p>Said Nasruddin, “Then your WHOLE life has been wasted. I am
going!”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this boat cannot go to the other shore. But people think
learning can become a boat, or learning can become a substitute for
swimming. No! Can scriptures become boats? No, they are too heavy. You
can drown with them but you cannot cross the river. Unlearning will make
you weightless; unlearning will make you innocent again.</p><p><br></p><p>When you don’t know, in that not knowing what happens? The most
beautiful phenomenon<span class=s5></span>The</p><p>greatest ecstasy happens when you don’t know – there is a silence
when you don’t know. Someone asks a question and you don’t know. Life is
a riddle, and you don’t know. Everywhere is mystery and you are standing
there not knowing, wondering. When you don’t know there is wonder, and
wonder is the most religious quality. The deepest religious quality is
wonder. Only a child can wonder. A man who knows cannot wonder, and
without wonder no one has ever reached the divine. It is the wondering
heart to which everything is a mystery...a butterfly is a mystery, a
seed sprouting is a mystery.</p><p>And remember, nothing has been solved: all your science has done
nothing. The seed sprouting is still a mystery and it is going to remain
a mystery. Even if science can create the seed, the sprouting will
remain a mystery. A child is born; it is a mystery that is born. Even if
the child can be produced in a test-tube, it makes no difference. The
mystery remains the same.</p><p><br></p><p>You are here. It is such a mystery. You have not earned it, you
cannot say to the universe, “I am here because I have earned it.” It is
a sheer gift, you are here for no reason at all. If you were not here,
what difference would it make? If you were not here, to what court could
you appeal?</p><p><br></p><p>This sheer existence, this breathing that goes in and out, this
moment that you are here, listening to me, to the breeze, to the birds,
this moment that you are alive, is such a mystery. If you can face it
without any knowledge you will enter into it. If you face it with
knowledge and you say, “I know, I know the answer,” the doors are closed
– not because of the mystery, the doors are closed because of your
knowledge, your theories, your philosophy, your theology, your
Christianity, your Hin-duism – they close the door.</p><p><br></p><p>A man who thinks he knows does not know. The Upanishads go on saying
that a man who thinks that he does not know, knows. Says Socrates: When
a man really knows, he knows only one thing, that he does not know.
Chuang Tzu says: It is because he has unlearned. Whatsoever the world
taught him, whatsoever society taught him, whatsoever parents and the
utilitarians taught him, he has dropped. He has again become a child, a
small child. His eyes are again filled with wonder. He looks all around
and everywhere is mystery.</p><p><br></p><p>Ego kills the mystery. Whether it is the ego of a scientist or
whether it is the ego of a scholar or of a philosopher, makes no
difference. The ego says, “I know.” And the ego says, “If I don’t know
now, then sooner or later I will come to know.” The ego says that there
is nothing un-knowable.</p><p><br></p><p>There are two categories for the ego: the known and the unknown. The
known is that part which the ego has already traveled, and the unknown
is that part which the ego will travel: the ego feels that it is
possible to travel, but there is nothing unknowable.</p><p>The ego leaves no mystery in the world. And when there is no mystery
around you, there cannot be any mystery within. When mystery disappears,
all songs disappear; when mystery disappears, poetry is dead; when
mystery disappears, God is not in the temple, there is nothing but a
dead statue; when mystery disappears there is no possibility of love,
because only two mysteries fall in love with each other. If you know,
then there is no possibility of love – knowledge is against love. And
love is always for unlearning. But because he has unlearned:</p><p><br></p><p>HIS NATURE SINKS TO ITS ROOT IN THE ONE. HIS VITALITY, HIS POWER,</p><p>HIDE IN SECRET TAO.</p><p><br></p><p>HIS NATURE SINKS TO ITS ROOT The ego exists in the head, remember,
and you carry your</p><p>head very high. The root is just at the other pole of your being.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu and Lao Tzu used to say: Concentrate on the toe. Close
your eyes and move into the toe and remain there. That will give you a
balance. The head has given you much imbalance. The toe ? It looks as if
they are joking. They mean it, they are not joking. They are right. Move
from the</p><p>head because the head is not the root, and we are in the head too
much.</p><p><br></p><p>HIS NATURE SINKS TO ITS ROOT, to the very source. The wave goes
deeper into the ocean, into the one. And remember, the source is one.
The waves may be many, millions, but the ocean is one. You are separate
there, I am separate here, but just look a little deeper at the roots
and we are one; we are like branches of the same tree. Look at the
bran-ches and they are separate, but deep down they are one.</p><p>The deeper you go, you will find less and less multiplicity, more and
more unity. At the deepest it is one. That is why Hindus talk of the
nondual, the one, ADVAIT.</p><p><br></p><p>HIS VITALITY, HIS POWER, HIDE IN SECRET TAO.</p><p>And whatsoever vitality comes to the man of Tao is not manipulated,
is not created by him, it is given by the roots. He is vital because he
is rooted; he is vital because he has rejoined the ocean, the one. He is
back at the source, he has come to the mother.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN HE IS ALL ONE, THERE IS NO FLAW IN HIM</p><p>BY WHICH A WEDGE CAN ENTER.</p><p><br></p><p>And whenever one is rooted in the deepest core of his being, which is
one, then there is no flaw. You cannot penetrate such a man. Swords
cannot go into him, fire cannot burn him. How can you destroy the
ultimate? You can destroy the momentary, how can you destroy the
ultimate? You can destroy the wave, how can you destroy the ocean? You
can destroy the individual, but you cannot destroy the soul. The form
can be killed, but the formless...? How will you kill the formless?
Where will you find the sword that can kill the formless?</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna said in the Gita, “NAINAM CHHEDANTI SASHTRANI – no sword can
kill it, no fire can burn it.” Not that if you go and kill Chuang Tzu
you will not be able to kill him. You will be able to kill the form, but
the form is not Chuang Tzu – and he will laugh.</p><p>It happened that Alexander was returning from India when suddenly he
remembered Aristotle, his teacher, one of the greatest logicians.</p><p><br></p><p>Aristotle is the original source of all Western stupidity, he is the
father. He created the logical mind. He created analysis, he created the
method of dissection, he created the ego and the individual, and he was
the teacher of Alexander.</p><p><br></p><p>He had told Alexander to bring a Hindu mystic, a sannyasin, when he
came back, because polar opposites are always interesting. He must have
been deeply interested to know what this Hindu mystic is. What type of
man can he be who lives beyond logic, who says there is only one not
two, who joins all the contradictions and paradoxes, whose whole
attitude is of synthesis, not of analysis? A man who never believes in
the part, who always believes in the whole, what type of man can he
be?</p><p><br></p><p>So he told Alexander, “When you come back, bring with you a Hindu
mystic, a sannyasin. I would like to see one. A man who lives beyond
mind and says that there is something beyond mind, is a rare
phenomenon.” And Aristotle never believed that there could be anything
beyond mind; for him mind was all.</p><p><br></p><p>When Alexander was returning, he suddenly remembered. So he asked his
soldiers to go and find a great Hindu mystic, a great sannyasin, a
saint, a sage. They inquired in the town and were told, “Yes. On the
bank of the river a naked man stands. For years he has been standing
there, and we think he is a mystic. We cannot be certain be-cause he
never speaks much, and we cannot be certain because we don’t understand
him much. What he says seems to be very illogical. Maybe it is true,
maybe it is not true.”</p><p><br></p><p>Alexander said, “This is the right man. My master, who has created
logic, would like to see this illogical man. Go and tell him that
Alex-ander invites him.”</p><p><br></p><p>The soldiers went and they told this naked man that Alexander the
Great invites him; he would be a royal guest, every comfort and
convenience would be given to him, so he shouldn’t worry.</p><p>The man started laughing and said, “The man who calls himself The
Great, is a fool. Go and tell him I don’t keep company with fools. That
is why I have been standing here alone for many years. If I want to keep
company with fools, do you think that India has less than his country?
The town is full of them.”</p><p><br></p><p>They were very disturbed, those soldiers, but they had to report
back. Alexander asked what the man had said – Dandami was the name of
this man. Alexander in his reports has used the name Dandamas. When he
heard Alexander felt annoyed, but this was the last village on the
border and soon he would be out of India, so he said, “It is best that I
go and see what type of man this is.”</p><p>He may have remembered Diogenes – maybe this man was the same type,
standing naked near a river. The same thing happened with Diogenes. He
also laughed and thought Alexander a fool.</p><p><br></p><p>So Alexander approached Dandami with a naked sword and said, “Follow
me, or I will cut your head off immediately. I don’t believe in
discussion, I believe in orders.”</p><p>The man laughed and said, “Cut it off – don’t wait! The head that you
will be cutting off, I have cut it off long ago. This is nothing new, I
am already headless. Cut it off, and I tell you, that when the head
falls down onto the earth you will see it fall and I will also see it
fall, because I am not the head.</p><p><br></p><p>The man of Tao can be burnt, but still the man of Tao cannot be
burnt. The form is always on fire. It is burning already. But the
formless...the formless is never touched by any fire. From where comes
the power, from where comes this vitality? They hide in secret Tao. Tao
means the great nature, Tao means the great ocean, Tao means the great
source.</p><p><br></p><p>SO A DRUNKEN MAN WHO FALLS OUT OF A WAGON IS BRUISED, BUT NOT
DESTROYED.</p><p>HIS BONES ARE LIKE THE BONES OF OTHER MEN, BUT HIS FALL IS
DIFFERENT.</p><p>The ego is not there.… HIS SPIRIT IS ENTIRE.</p><p>HE IS NOT AWARE OF GETTING INTO A WAGON, OR FALLING OUT OF ONE.</p><p>LIFE AND DEATH ARE NOTHING TO HIM. H E KNOWS NO ALARM,</p><p>HE MEETS OBSTACLES WITHOUT THOUGHT, WITHOUT CARE AND TAKES THEM
WITHOUT KNOWING THEY ARE THERE.</p><p>IF THERE IS SUCH SECURITY IN WINE, HOW MUCH MORE IN TAO?</p><p><br></p><p>THE WISE MAN IS HIDDEN IN TAO, NOTHING CAN TOUCH HIM.</p><p><br></p><p>Watch a drunkard, because the man of Tao is in many ways similar to
him. He walks, but there is no walker; that is why he looks unbalanced,
wobbling. He walks, but there is no direction, he is not going anywhere.
He walks, but the boat is empty, only momentarily, but it is empty.</p><p><br></p><p>Watch a drunkard. Follow him and see what is happening to him. If
somebody hits him he is not annoyed. If he falls down he accepts the
falling, he doesn’t resist, he falls down as if dead. If people laugh
and joke about him he is not worried. He may even joke with them, he may
start laughing with them, he may start laughing at himself. What has
happened? Momentarily, through chemicals, his ego is not there.</p><p>The ego is a construction: you can drop it through chemicals too. It
is just a construction; it is not a reality, it is not substantial in
you. It is through society that you have learned it. Alcohol simply
drops you out of society. That is why society is always against alcohol,
the government is always against alcohol, the university is always
against alcohol, all the moralists are always against alcohol – because
alcohol is dangerous, it gives you a glimpse of the outside of society.
That is why there is so much propaganda in America and in the West
against drugs.</p><p><br></p><p>The governments, the politicians, the church, the pope, they have all
become scared because the new generation is too involved in drugs. They
are very dangerous for society, because once you have glimpses beyond
society you can never become a really adjusted part of it. You will
always remain an outsider. Once you have a glimpse of the non-ego then
society cannot dominate you easily. And if one goes too deep into drugs
then it is possible for the ego to be shattered completely. Then you
will become as if mad.</p><p><br></p><p>Once or twice a drug will give you a glimpse; it is just as if a
window opens and closes. If you persist and you become addicted to it,
the ego may suddenly drop. But this is the problem: the ego will drop,
but the non-ego will not arise. You will go mad, schizophrenic,
split.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion works from the other corner, from the other end: it tries to
bring up the non-ego first. And the more the non-ego comes up, the more
the whole asserts, the more the ego will drop automatically, by and by.
Before the ego drops, the whole has taken possession. You will not go
mad, you will not become abnormal, you will simply be natural. You will
fall outside society into nature.</p><p>Through drugs you can also fall out of society, but into madness.
That is why religions are also against drugs. Society has given you a
working arrangement for the ego: through it you manage somehow, you
steer your life somehow. But if the whole takes possession then there is
no problem – you become a man of Tao. Then there is no need for this
ego, you can throw it to the dogs.</p><p>But you can do otherwise also. You can simply destroy this ego
through chemicals. This can be done. Then there WILL be a problem
because you will simply become abnormal. You will feel a certain power,
but that power will be false, because the whole has not taken possession
of you.</p><p>Many cases of this have been reported. One girl in New York, under
lsd, just jumped out of a window on the thirtieth floor because she
thought she could fly. And when you are under a drug, if</p><p><br></p><p>the thought comes that you can fly, there is no doubt. You believe in
it totally, because the doubter, the ego, is not there. Who is there to
doubt? You believe it. But the whole has not asserted itself.</p><p>Chuang Tzu might have flown. Chuang Tzu might have gone out of the
window like a bird on wings, but under lsd you cannot. The ego is not
there so you cannot doubt, but the whole has not taken possession so you
are not powerful. The power is not there, only the illusion of power.
That creates trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>Under alcohol you can do certain things.…</p><p><br></p><p>A circus was traveling in a special train from one town to another
and a cage was damaged and the lion escaped. So the manager gathered all
his strong men and said, “Before you go into the night, into the jungle
to find the lion, I will give you some wine. It will give you
courage.”</p><p>All twenty of them took big shots. The night was cold and dangerous
and courage was needed – but</p><p>Mulla Nasruddin refused. He said, “I will only have soda.” The
manager protested, “But you will need courage!”</p><p>Nasruddin replied, “In such moments I don’t need courage. These
moments are dangerous – night</p><p>time and the lion, and courage can be dangerous. I would rather be a
coward and alert.”</p><p><br></p><p>When you don’t have power and a drug can give you courage, it is
dangerous. You can move madly on a certain path – this is the danger of
drugs.</p><p>But society is not afraid because of this. Society is afraid that if
you have a glimpse beyond society then you will never be adjusted to it.
And society is such a madhouse – to be adjusted to it you must not be
allowed any glimpse outside.</p><p><br></p><p>Religions are also against drugs and alcohol, but for a different
reason. They say: Be a drunkard, a drunkard of the divine wine, because
then you are rooted, centered. Then you are powerful.</p><p><br></p><p>IF THERE IS SUCH SECURITY IN WINE, HOW MUCH MORE IN TAO?</p><p>THE WISE MAN IS HIDDEN IN TAO, NOTHING CAN TOUCH HIM.</p><p>Absolutely nothing can touch him. Why? If you follow me rightly, only
the ego can be touched. It is very touchy. If somebody just looks at you
in a certain way, it is touched. He has not done anything. If somebody
smiles a little, it is touched; if somebody just turns his head and does
not look at you, it is touched. It is very touchy. It is like a wound,
always open, green. You touch it and the pain arises. A single word, a
single gesture – the other may not even be aware of what he has done to
you, but he has touched it.</p><p><br></p><p>And you always think the other is responsible, that he has wounded
you. No, you carry your wound. With the ego your whole being is a wound.
And you carry it around. Nobody is interested in hurting you, nobody is
positively waiting to hurt you; everybody is engaged in safeguarding his
own wound. Who has got the energy? But still it happens, because you are
so ready to be wounded, so ready, just waiting on the brink for
anything.</p><p>You cannot touch a man of Tao. Why? – because there is no one to be
touched. There is no wound. He is healthy, healed, whole. This word
whole is beautiful. The word heal comes from the whole, and the word
holy also comes from the whole. He is whole, healed, holy.</p><p><br></p><p>Be aware of your wound. Don’t help it to grow, let it be healed; and
it will be healed only when you move to the roots. The less the head,
the more the wound will heal – with no head there is no wound. Live a
headless life. Move as a total being, and accept things. Just for
twenty-four hours, try it – total acceptance, whatsoever happens.
Someone insults you, accept it, don’t react, and see what happens.
Suddenly you will feel an energy flowing in you that you have not felt
before. Somebody insults you: you feel weak, you feel disturbed, you
start thinking of how to get your revenge. That man has hooked you, and
now you will move round and round. For days, nights, months, even years,
you will not be able to sleep, you will have bad dreams. People can
waste their whole life over a small thing, just because someone insulted
them.</p><p><br></p><p>Just look back into your past and you will remember a few things. You
were a small child and the teacher in the class called you an idiot, and
you still remember it and you feel resentment. Your father said
something. Your parents have forgotten, and even if you remind them,
they will not be able to remember it. Your mother looked at you in a
certain way and since then the wound has been there. And it is still
open, fresh; if anybody touches it, you will explode. Don’t help this
wound to grow. Don’t make this wound your soul. Go to the roots, be with
the whole. For twenty-four hours, just twenty-four hours, try not to
react, not to reject, whatsoever happens.</p><p>If someone pushes you and you fall to the ground – fall! Then get up
and go home. Don’t do anything about it. If somebody hits you, bow down
your head, accept it with gratitude. Go home, don’t do anything, just
for twenty-four hours, and you will know a new upsurge of energy that
you have never known before, a new vitality arising from the roots. And
once you know it, once you have tasted it, your life will be different.
Then you will laugh at all the foolish things you have been doing, at
all the resentments, reactions, revenges, with which you have been
destroying yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody else can destroy you except you; nobody else can save you
except you. You are the Judas and you are the Jesus.</p><p>Enough for today.</p><p><br></p><p>CHAPTER <span class=s7>1 1</span></p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu’s Funeral</p><p><br></p><p>20 July 1974 am in Buddha Hall</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN CHUANG TZU WAS ABOUT DIE,</p><p>HIS DISCIPLES BEGAN PLANNING A GRAND FUNERAL.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT CHUANG TZU SAID:</p><p>I SHALL HAVE HEAVEN AND EARTH FOR MY COFFIN; THE SUN AND MOON WILL BE
JADE SYMBOLS HANGING BY MY SIDE;</p><p>PLANETS AND CONSTELLATIONS</p><p>WILL SHINE AS JEWELS ALL AROUND ME, AND ALL BEINGS WILL BE
PRESENT</p><p>AS MOURNERS AT THE WAKE. WHAT MORE IS NEEDED?</p><p>EVERYTHING IS AMPLY TAKEN CARE OF.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT THE DISCIPLES SAID:</p><p>WE FEAR THAT THE CROWS AND KITES WILL EAT OUR MASTER.</p><p><br></p><p>CHUANG TZU REPLIED:</p><p>WELL, ABOVE GROUND I SHALL BE EATEN BY CROWS AND KITES,</p><p>AND BELOW GROUND BY ANTS AND WORMS. IN EITHER CASE I SHALL BE
EATEN</p><p>SO WHY ARE YOU FAVOURING THE BIRDS?</p><p><br></p><p>Mind makes everything a problem. Otherwise life is simple, death is
simple; there is not a problem</p><p>at all. But mind gives the deception that every moment is a problem
and has to be solved. Once you take the first step of believing that
everything is a problem, nothing can be solved because the first step is
absolutely wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind cannot give you any solution; it is the mechanism which gives
you problems. Even if you think you have solved a problem, thousands of
new problems will arise out of the solution. This is what philosophy has
always been doing. Philosophy is the business of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment mind looks at anything it looks with a question mark; it
looks with the eyes of doubt. Very simple is life, and very simple is
death - but only if you can see without the mind. Once you bring the
mind in, then everything is complex, then everything is confusion. And
mind tries to solve the confusion when really it is the source of all
confusions; so more confusion is created.</p><p><br></p><p>It is as if a small stream is flowing in the hills. Some carts have
passed through it, and the stream is muddy, and you jump into the stream
to clean it. You will only make it more muddy. It is better to wait on
the bank. It is better to let the stream become tranquil again, calm
down by itself, so that dead leaves go and the mud settles and the
stream is again crystal clear.</p><p>Your help is not needed. You will only confuse it more.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you feel that there is a problem, please, don't poke your nose
in it. Sit by the side. Don't allow the mind to get involved, tell the
mind to wait. And it is very difficult for the mind to wait it is
impatience incarnate.</p><p><br></p><p>If you tell the mind to wait, meditation happens. If you can persuade
the mind to wait, you will be in prayer. Because waiting means no
thinking, it means just sitting on the bank not doing anything with the
stream. What can you do? Whatsoever you do will make it more muddy; your
very entering into the stream will create more problems. So wait.</p><p><br></p><p>All meditation is waiting. All prayer is infinite patience. The whole
of religion consists in not allowing the mind to create more problems
for you. So many things, simple things, which even animals enjoy, which
even trees enjoy, man cannot enjoy because immediately they become
problems and how can you enjoy a problem?</p><p>You fall in love, and the mind immediately says: What is love? Is
this love or sex? Is this true or false? Where am I going? Can love be
eternal or is it just momentary?</p><p><br></p><p>The mind wants first to decide everything, then to take the step. And
with the mind there is never any decision, it remains indecisive,
indecision is its inherent nature. It says: Don't take the jump, And
when mind tells you these things, it seems very clever, it seems very
intelligent, because it seems that you may go wrong. So don't take the
jump, don't move, remain static.</p><p><br></p><p>But life is movement and life is trust. Love happens - one has to
move into it. Where it leads is not the point. The goal is not the
point. The very movement of your consciousness in love is a revelation.
The other is not the point, the beloved or the lover is not the point.
The point is that you can love, that it could happen to you, that your
being opened in trust, without any doubt, without any questioning. This
very opening is a fulfillment.</p><p>But the mind will say: Wait, let me think and decide; one should not
take any step in haste. Then you can wait and wait. That is how you have
been missing life. Every moment life knocks at your door, but you are
thinking. You say to life: Wait, I will open the door, but let me first
decide.</p><p>It never happens. The whole of life will come and go, and you will be
simply dragging, neither alive nor dead. Both life and death are good
because death has a life of its own.</p><p><br></p><p>So remember, the first thing is not to allow the mind to interfere.
Then you can be like trees, even</p><p>greener. Then you can be like birds on the wing, and no bird can
reach to heights which you can touch. Then you can be like fishes which
go to the very bottom of the sea - you can go to the very bottom of the
ocean, nothing is comparable to you.</p><p>Human consciousness is the most evolved phenomenon, but you are
missing. Even less evolved states are enjoying more. A bird is a bird, a
very much less evolved being than you; a tree is almost not evolved at
all, but enjoying more, flowering more. More fulfillment is happening
all around it. Why are you missing?</p><p><br></p><p>Your mind has become a burden. You have not been using it; rather, on
the contrary, you are being used by it. Don't allow the mind to
interfere with your life, and then there will be a flow. Then you are
unobstructed, then you are transparent, then each moment is bliss
because you are not worried about it.</p><p><br></p><p>A man was advised by his psychoanalyst to go to the hills. He was
always complaining and complaining about this and that, and always
asking questions. He was never at ease with anything, never at home. He
was advised to go for a rest.</p><p>The next day a telegram arrived for the psychoanalyst. In it the man
said: I am feeling very happy here. Why?</p><p>You cannot even accept happiness without asking why. It is impossible
for the mind to accept anything - the 'why' is immediately there. And
the 'why' destroys everything. Hence so much insistence in all religions
on faith. This is the meaning of faith: not allowing the mind to ask the
why.</p><p><br></p><p>Faith is not belief. It is not believing in a certain theory. Faith
is believing in life itself. Faith is not believing in the Bible, or the
Koran, or the Gita. Faith is not belief; faith is a trust, a
non-doubting trust. And only those who are faithful, those who are
capable of trust, will be able to know what life is and what death
is.</p><p><br></p><p>For us, life is a problem, so death is bound to be a problem. We are
constantly trying to solve it and wasting time and energy in solving it.
It is already solved. It has never been a problem. It is you who are
creating the problem. Look at the stars, there is no problem; look at
the trees, there is no problem. Look all around.…</p><p><br></p><p>If man were not there everything would be already solved. Where is
the problem? The trees never ask who created the world they simply enjoy
it. What foolishness to ask who created the world.</p><p>And what difference does it make who created the world: A, B, C or D,
what difference does it make? And whether it was created or it is
uncreated, what difference does it make? How will it affect you if 'A'
created the world, or 'B' created the world, or nobody created the
world? You will remain the same, life will remain the same. So why ask
an unnecessary, irrelevant question and get entangled in it?</p><p>The rivers go on flowing never asking where they are going. They
reach the sea. If they start asking, they might not; their energy might
be lost on the way. They might become so anxious about where they are
going - where is the goal, what is the purpose so obsessed with the
problem that they might go mad. But they go on flowing, unworried about
where they are going, and they always reach the sea.</p><p><br></p><p>When trees and rivers can do this miracle, why can't you do it? This
is the whole of Chuang Tzu's philosophy, his whole way of life: When
everything is happening, why are you worried? Allow it to happen. When
rivers can reach, man will reach. When trees reach, man will reach. When
this whole existence is moving, you are part of it. Don't become a
whirlpool of thinking otherwise you go round and round, round and round,
and the flow is lost. Then there is no oceanic experience in the
end.</p><p>Life is a riddle to you because you look through the mind; if you
look through the no-mind, life is a mystery. Life is already dead if you
look through the mind; and life never dies if you look through the
no-mind. Mind cannot feel the alive. Mind can only touch the dead, the
material. Life is so subtle, and mind is so crude the instrument is not
as subtle as life.</p><p>And when you touch with that instrument it cannot catch the throbs of
life. It misses. The throbbing is very subtle. You are the
throbbing.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu is on his deathbed. And when a man like Chuang Tzu is on
his deathbed the disciples should be absolutely silent. This moment is
not to be missed because death is the peak. When Chuang Tzu dies, he
dies at the peak. It happens rarely that consciousness reaches its
absolute fulfillment. The disciples should be silent; they should watch
what is happening; they should look deep into Chuang Tzu and should not
allow the mind to interfere, nor to start asking foolish questions.</p><p><br></p><p>But the mind always starts asking. They are worried about the funeral
and Chuang Tzu is still alive. But the mind is not alive, it is never
alive; the mind is always thinking in terms of death. For the disciples
the master is already dead. They are thinking about the funeral what to
do, what not to do. They are creating a problem which doesn't exist at
all because Chuang Tzu is still alive.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that three old men were sitting in a park, discussing
the inevitable, death. One old man of seventy-three said: When I die I
would like to be buried with Abraham Lincoln, the greatest man, loved by
all. The other said: I would like to be buried with Albert Einstein, the
greatest scientist, humanitarian, philosopher and lover of peace. Then
they both looked at the third, who was ninety- three. He said: I would
like to be buried with Sophia Loren. They both felt annoyed, angry and
they said:</p><p>But she is still alive. That old man said: So am I!</p><p>This old man must have been something rare. Ninety-three, and he
said: So am I! Why should life be worried about death? Why should life
think about death? When you are alive, where is the problem? But the
mind creates the problem. Then you get puzzled.</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates was dying, and the same thing happened as happened with
Chuang Tzu. The disciples were worried about the funeral. They asked
him: What should we do? Socrates is reported to have said: My enemies
are giving poison to kill me and you are making plans to bury me. So who
is my friend and who is my enemy? You are both concerned with my death;
nobody seems to be concerned with my life.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is somehow death-obsessed. The disciples of Chuang Tzu were
thinking what they should do and the master was dying, a great
phenomenon was happening right then. There, a Buddha, a Chuang Tzu, was
reaching the ultimate peak. It happens rarely, once or twice in millions
of years.</p><p>The flame was burning. His life had come to a point of absolute
purity where it is Divine, not human, where it is total, not partial,
where the beginning and the end meet, where all the secrets are open and
all the doors are open, where everything is unlocked. The whole mystery
was there And the</p><p>disciples were thinking of the funeral, blind, absolutely blind, not
seeing what was happening.</p><p>Their eyes were closed. But why does it happen? These disciples, do
you think that they knew Chuang Tzu? How could they have? If they missed
Chuang Tzu in his supreme glory, how can we believe that they didn't
miss him when he was working with them, working on them, moving with
them, digging a hole in the garden, planting a seed, talking to them,
just being present with them?</p><p>How can we feel that they knew who this Chuang Tzu was? When his
total glory was missed, it is impossible not to think that they had
missed him always. They must have missed. When he was talking, then they
must have been thinking: What is he talking about? What does he
mean?</p><p>When an enlightened person speaks, meaning is not to be discovered by
you - it is there. You have simply to listen to it. It is not to be
discovered, it is not hidden, and it is nothing to be interpreted. He is
not talking in theories. He is giving you simple facts. If your eyes are
open, you will see them; if your ears can hear, you will hear them.
Nothing more is needed. That is why Jesus keeps on saying:</p><p>If you can hear, hear me. If you can see, see. Nothing more is
expected - just open eyes, open ears.</p><p>Buddha, Chuang Tzu, or Jesus, are not philosophers, like Hegel, Kant.
If you read Hegel, the meaning has to be discovered. It is very arduous,
as if Hegel is making every effort to make it as difficult for you as
possible, weaving words around words, making everything riddle-like.</p><p>So when you first encounter Hegel he will look superb, a very high
peak, but the more you penetrate and the more you understand, the lesser
he becomes. The day you understand him, he is just useless. The whole
trick is that you cannot understand him that is why you feel he is
great.</p><p>Because you cannot understand, your mind is baffled, because you
cannot understand, your mind cannot comprehend, the thing seems to be
very mysterious, incomprehensible. It is not, it is only verbal.</p><p>He is trying to hide, he is not saying anything. Rather, he is using
words without any substance.</p><p>So persons like Hegel are immediately appreciated, but as time
passes, appreciation of them disappears. Persons like Buddha are not
immediately appreciated, but as time passes, you appreciate them more.
They are always before their time. Centuries pass, and then, then their
greatness starts emerging, then their greatness starts appearing. Then
you can feel them, because their truth is so simple, there is no
garbage, no rubbish around it.</p><p>It is so factual that you can miss it if you think about it. When you
are listening to a Chuang Tzu, just listen. Nothing else is needed on
your part but a passive receptivity, a welcome. Everything is clear, but
you can make it a mess, and then you can get confused by your own
creation.</p><p>These disciples must have missed Chuang Tzu - they are missing him
again. They are worried about what is going to be done. And this point
has to be understood: a man of wisdom is always concerned with the
being, and a man of ignorance is always concerned with questions of
doing, what is to be done. Being is not a question to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu is concerned with being; the disciples are concerned with
doing. If death is coming then what is to be done? What should we do?
The master is going to die. So what about the funeral? We must plan it.
We are mad about planning. We plan life, we plan death, and through
planning, the spontaneity is destroyed, the beauty is destroyed, the
whole ecstasy is destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that an atheist was dying. He didn't believe in heaven
or hell but still he thought that it would be best to be properly
dressed before dying. He didn't know where he was going because he
didn't believe in anything, but still, he was going somewhere, so before
going somewhere one must get properly dressed. He was a man of manners,
etiquette, so he put on his dress suit, tie and all, and then he died.
The Rabbi was called to bless him. The Rabbi said: This man never
believed, but look how he has planned! He did not believe he had nowhere
to go, and how beautifully dressed and ready!</p><p>Even if you feel that you are not going anywhere, you plan it,
because the mind always wants to play with the future. It is very happy
planning for the future; it is very unhappy living in the present.</p><p>But planning for the future seems beautiful. Whenever you have time,
you start planning for the future, whether of this world or of that, but
the future. And the mind enjoys planning. Planning is just fantasy,
dreaming, day-dreaming. Persons like Chuang Tzu are concerned with
being, not becoming. They are not concerned with doing; they are not
concerned with the future. No planning is needed. Existence takes care
of itself.</p><p>Jesus said to his disciples: Look at these flowers, these lilies, so
beautiful in their glory that even Solomon was not so beautiful. And
they don't plan, and they don't think for the future, and they are not
worried about the next moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Why are the lilies so beautiful? In what does their beauty consist,
where is it hidden? The lilies exist here and now. Why is the human face
so sad and ugly? Because it is never here and now. It is always in the
future, it is a ghost-like thing. How can you be real if you are not
here and now? You can only be a ghost, either visiting the past or
moving into the future.</p><p>Chuang Tzu is dying. At the moment of Chuang Tzu's death the
disciples should have been silent. That would have been the most
respectful thing to do, the most loving thing to do. The master was
dying. They never listened to his life; at least they could have
listened to his death. They could not be silent while he was talking to
them throughout his life, now he was going to give his last sermon
through his death.</p><p>One should be watchful when a wise man dies because he dies in a
different way. An ignorant man cannot die that way. You have your life
and you have your death. If you have been foolish in your life, how can
you be wise in your death? Death is the outcome, the total outcome, the
conclusion.</p><p>In death your whole life is there in essence - so a foolish man dies
in a foolish way. Life is unique, death is also unique. Nobody else can
live your life and nobody else can die your death, only you. It is
unique. It never happens again.</p><p><br></p><p>Styles differ, not only in life, but also in death. When Chuang Tzu
dies, one has to be absolutely silent, so that one does not miss it.
Because you can miss.</p><p>Life is a long affair, seventy, eighty, a hundred years. Death is in
one moment. It is an atomic phenomenon, concentrated. It is more vital
than life because life is spread out. Life can never be as intense as
death can be, and life can never be as beautiful as death can be,
because it is a spread- out thing. It is always lukewarm. At the moment
of death the whole of life has come to a boiling point. Everything
evaporates from this world to the other, from the body to the bodiless.
It is the greatest transformation that happens. One should be silent,
one should be respectful, one should not be wavering, because it will
happen in a single moment and you may miss it.</p><p>And the foolish disciples were talking about the funeral and thinking
of making a grand thing out of it! And the grandest thing was happening,
the greatest thing was happening, but they were thinking of the show.
The mind always thinks of the exhibition. It is exhibitionistic.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasrudin died. Somebody informed his wife who was taking her
afternoon tea - half the cup was finished. The man said: Your husband is
dead, he fell under a bus. But Mulla Nasrudin's wife continued sipping
her tea.</p><p>The man said: What! You have not even stopped drinking! Do you hear
me? Your husband is dead and you have not even said a single thing!</p><p>The wife said: Let me first finish my tea, and then, boy, will I give
a scream!</p><p>Just wait a little while. The mind is exhibitionistic. She will
scream, just give her a little time to arrange, to plan it!</p><p>I have heard about an actor whose wife died. He was crying his heart
out, he was screaming, Many tears were rolling down his cheeks.</p><p>A friend said: I never thought that you loved your wife so much. The
actor looked at his friend and said: This is nothing. You should have
seen me when my first wife died.</p><p><br></p><p>Even when you show your anguish you are looking at others and
wondering what they think about it. Why think of a grand funeral? Why
grand? You make an exhibition out of death also. Is this really
respectful? Or is death also something on the market, a commodity?</p><p>Our master has died, so there is a competition, and we must prove
that he had the greatest funeral</p><p>- no other master ever had one like it and no other will ever have
one like it again. Even in death you are thinking of the ego. But
disciples are like that, they follow. But they never really follow,
because if they had followed Chuang Tzu, they couldn't have raised the
question of a grand funeral.</p><p><br></p><p>They would have been humble in that moment. But the ego is assertive.
Whenever you say that your master is very great, just look within. You
are saying: I am very great, that is why I follow this great man, I am a
great follower.</p><p>Every follower claims that his master is the greatest - but not
because of the master! How can you be a great follower if the master is
not great? And if someone says that this is not so, you get annoyed,
irritated, you start arguing and fighting. It is a question of the
survival of the ego. Everywhere the ego asserts. It is cunning and very
subtle. Even in death it will not leave you; even in death it will be
there.</p><p><br></p><p>The master is dying, and the disciples are thinking of the funeral.
They have not followed the master at all a master like Chuang Tzu whose
whole teaching consists in being spontaneous.</p><p>WHEN CHUANG TZU WAS ABOUT TO DIE,</p><p>HIS DISCIPLES BEGAN PLANNING A GRAND FUNERAL.</p><p><br></p><p>He is not yet dead and they have started planning. Because the
question is not Chuang Tzu, the question is the egos of the disciples.
They must give him a grand send-off, and everybody must be made to
realize that never ever before has such a thing happened.</p><p>But you cannot deceive Chuang Tzu. Even when he is dying he will not
leave you alone; even when he is dying he cannot be deceived; even when
he is leaving, he will give you his heart, his wisdom; even at the last
moment he will share whatsoever he has known and realized. Even his last
moment is going to be a sharing.</p><p>But Chuang Tzu said:</p><p><br></p><p>I SHALL HAVE HEAVEN AND EARTH FOR MY COFFIN, THE SUN AND MOON WILL BE
JADE SYMBOLS HANGING BY MY SIDE;</p><p>PLANETS AND CONSTELLATIONS</p><p>WILL SHINE AS JEWELS ALL AROUND ME, AND ALL BEINGS WILL BE
PRESENT</p><p>AS MOURNERS AT THE WAKE.</p><p>What more is needed? Everything is simple: simply, amply taken care
of. What more is needed? What more can you do? What more can you do for
a Chuang Tzu, for a Buddha? Whatsoever you do will be nothing,
whatsoever you plan is going to be trivial. It cannot be grand because
the whole universe is ready to receive him. What more can you do?</p><p>Chuang Tzu said: The sun and the moon and all the beings on earth and
heaven are ready to receive me. And all beings, the whole existence,
will be the mourners. So you need not worry, you need not engage
mourners. You can engage mourners. Now they are available on the
market.</p><p>There are people who you pay, and they mourn. What type of humanity
is coming into being?</p><p>If a wife dies or a mother dies, nobody is there to mourn, so you
have to engage professional mourners. They are available in Bombay,
Calcutta; in big cities they are available,</p><p>And they do such a good job you cannot compete with them. Of course,
they are more efficient, they get daily practice. But what ugliness it
is when you have to pay for it. The whole thing has become false.</p><p>Life is false, death is false, and happiness is false. Even mourning
is false. And this has to be; it has a logical meaning to it. If you
have never been really happy with a person, how can you be really
mournful when he dies? It is impossible. If you have not been happy with
your wife, if you have never known any blissful moments with her, when
she dies how can authentic tears come to your eyes? Deep down you will
be happy, deep down you feel a freedom: Now I am independent, now I can
move according to my desire. The wife was like an imprisonment.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that a man was dying and his wife was consoling him,
saying: Don't worry. Sooner or later I will join you. The man said: But
don't be unfaithful to me. He must have been afraid. Why this fear at
the last moment? This fear must have been there always.</p><p>The wife promised: I will never be unfaithful to you.</p><p>So the man said: If you commit even a single act of unfaithfulness
towards me, I will turn in my grave. It will be very painful for me.</p><p>Ten years later the wife died. At the gate of heaven, St. Peter asked
her: Who would you like to see first? She said: My husband, of course.
St. Peter asked: What is his name? So she said: Abraham. But St. Peter
replied: It is going to be difficult to find him because we have
millions of Abrahams.</p><p>So give me a clue about him.</p><p>The wife thought and said: With his dying breath he said that if I
committed any act of unfaithfulness towards him, he would turn in his
grave.</p><p>St. Peter said: Say no more. You must mean twirling Abraham, the one
who is constantly twirling in his grave! For ten years he has not had a
single moment of rest. And everybody knows about him. There is no
problem, we will call him immediately.</p><p>No faith, no trust, no love, no happiness, has ever happened out of
your relationship. When death comes, how can you mourn? Your mourning
will be false. If your life is false, your death is going to be false.
And don't think that you are the only false one. All around, those who
are related to you are false. And we live in such a false world it is
simply amazing how we can continue.</p><p>A politician was out of work, he was an ex-minister. He was looking
for a job because politicians are always in difficulty when they are not
in office. They cannot do anything other than politics; they don't know
anything else but politics. And they don't have any qualifications
either. Even a puny job requires certain qualifications - but for a
minister none are needed. A chief minister or a prime minister does not
need any qualifications at all. So this minister was in trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>He met the manager of a circus because he thought that as politics is
a great circus, he must have learned a little something which he could
use in the circus.</p><p>So he said: Can you find me a job? I am out of work, and in much
trouble.</p><p>The manager said: You have come at the right time. One of the bears
has died so we will give you a bear's costume. You don't have to do
anything, just sit doing nothing all day, and nobody will know the
difference. Just sit from morning to evening so the people will know
that the bear is there.</p><p>The job looked good, so the politician accepted. He entered the cage,
put on his costume, and sat down. He was sitting there, when just
fifteen minutes later another bear was shoved in. So he panicked and ran
to the bars, started shaking them and cried out: Help, let me out of
here!</p><p>Then he heard a voice. The other bear was speaking. He said: Do you
think you are the only politician out of work? I am an ex-minister too.
Don't be so afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole of life has become false, root and all, and how you exist
in it is a sheer miracle. Talking with a false face, talking to a false
face, happiness false and misery false. And then you hope to find the
truth! With false faces the truth can never be found. One has to realize
his own true face and drop all the false masks.</p><p>Said Chuang Tzu:</p><p>I SHALL HAVE HEAVEN AND EARTH FOR MY COFFIN.</p><p><br></p><p>So why are you worried? And how can you manage a greater coffin than
that? Let heaven and earth be my coffin - they will be.</p><p><br></p><p>THE SUN AND MOON WILL BE JADE SYMBOLS HANGING BY MY SIDE.</p><p>So you need not burn candles around me, they will be momentary, and
sooner or later they will not be there. Let sun and moon be the symbols
of life around me. And they are.</p><p>PLANETS AND CONSTELLATIONS</p><p>WILL SHINE AS JEWELS ALL AROUND ME, AND ALL BEINGS WILL BE
PRESENT</p><p><br></p><p>This is something to be understood: all beings will be present. It is
also said of Buddha and Mahavir but nobody believes it because it is
impossible to believe. Jains read it, but even they don't believe it;
Buddhists read it, but doubt enters their mind.</p><p>It is said that when Mahavir died all the beings were present there.
Not only human beings, but animals, the souls of the trees, angels,
deities; all the beings from all the dimensions of existence were
present there. And this should be so because a Mahavir is not only
revealed to you; the glory is such, the height is such that all the
dimensions of existence become acquainted with him.</p><p>It is said that when Mahavir used to speak, angels, deities, animals,
ghosts, all types of beings were there to listen to him, not only human
beings.</p><p>It looks like a story, a parable, but I tell you that this is a
truth; because the higher you reach, the higher your being grows, and
other dimensions of existence become available to you.</p><p>When one reaches the highest point - the point of ARIHANT Jains call
it, the point of ARHAT Buddhists call it, the point of the perfect Tao
the man of Tao, Chuang Tzu, calls it - then the whole existence
listens.</p><p><br></p><p>Says Chuang Tzu:</p><p>AND ALL BEINGS WILL BE PRESENT AS MOURNERS AT THE WAKE.</p><p><br></p><p>What more is needed, and what more can you do? What more can you add
to it? You need not do anything, and you need not worry.</p><p>EVERYTHING IS AMPLY TAKEN CARE OF.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the feeling of one who becomes silent:</p><p><br></p><p>EVERYTHING IS AMPLY TAKEN CARE OF.</p><p>Life and death, everything, you need not do anything; everything is
already happening without you. You unnecessarily come into it and you
create confusion, you create chaos.</p><p>Without you everything is perfect as it is, it is perfect. This is
the attitude of a religious man; as it is, everything is perfect.
Nothing more can be done to it.</p><p>In the West, Leibniz is reported to have said that this is the most
perfect of all possible worlds. He has been criticized because in the
West you cannot assert such things. How is this world the most perfect
world? This seems to be the most imperfect, the most ugly, ill; there is
inequality, suffering, poverty, illness, death, hatred, everything. And
this Leibniz says that this is the most perfect of all</p><p>possible worlds.</p><p><br></p><p>Leibniz has been criticized severely but Chuang Tzu would have
understood what he means. I understand what he means. When Leibniz said,
'This is the most perfect world possible,' he was not making any comment
on the political or economic situation. He was not making any comment on
equality, inequality, socialism, communism, wars. The comment is not
objective, the comment is not concerned with the without; the comment is
concerned with the inner feeling - it comes from the very being. That
everything is perfect means there is no need to worry.</p><p><br></p><p>EVERYTHING IS AMPLY TAKEN CARE OF.</p><p><br></p><p>And you cannot make it better; you just cannot make it better. If you
try, you may make it worse, but you cannot make it better. It is very
difficult for the scientific mind to understand that you cannot make it
better, because the scientific mind depends on this idea that things can
get better. But what have you done? For two thousand years since
Aristotle, we have been trying in the West to make the world a better
place. Has it become better in any way? Is man even a little bit
happier? Is man even a little more blissful? Not at all, things have
become worse. The more we treat the patient, the nearer he comes to
death. Nothing has been helpful. Man is not happier at all. We may have
more things to be happy with, but the heart which can be happy is
lost.</p><p>You may have palaces, but the man who can be an emperor is no more,
so palaces become graves. Your cities are more beautiful, richer, but
they are just like graveyards, no living person lives there. We have
made a mistake in trying to make the world better. It is not better. It
may be worse.</p><p><br></p><p>Look back ... man was totally different, poorer but richer. It looks
paradoxical, he was poorer, not enough food, not enough clothing, there
was not enough shelter, but life was richer. He could dance, he could
sing. Your song is lost, your throat is choked by things, and no song
can come out of the heart. You cannot dance. At the most, you can make
some movements, but those movements are not dance, because dancing is
not just a movement. When a movement becomes ecstatic then it is dance.
When the movement is so total that there is no ego, then it is a
dance.</p><p><br></p><p>And you should know that dancing came into the world as a technique
of meditation. The beginning of dancing was not for dance, it was to
achieve an ecstasy where the dancer was lost, only the dance remained no
ego, nobody manipulating, the body flowing spontaneously.</p><p>You can dance, but only in dead movements. You can manipulate the
body: It may be good exercise, but it is not ecstasy. You still embrace
each other, you still kiss, you still make all the movements of
love-making, but love is not there, only movements. You make them and
you feel frustrated. You make them and you know nothing is happening.
You do everything, and still a constant feeling of frustration follows
you like a shadow.</p><p>When Leibniz says that this is the most perfect of all possible
worlds, he is saying what Chuang Tzu is saying:</p><p><br></p><p>EVERYTHING IS AMPLY TAKEN CARE OF.</p><p>You need not worry about life; you need not worry about death. The
same source which takes care of life will take care of death. You need
not think about a grand funeral. The same source which has given me
birth will absorb me, and the same source is enough. We need not add
anything to it.</p><p><br></p><p>The disciples listened, but couldn't understand, otherwise there
would have been no need to say anything any more. But the disciples
still said:</p><p>WE FEAR THAT THE CROWS AND KITES WILL EAT OUR MASTER.</p><p>If we don't make any preparation, if we don't plan, then crows and
kites will eat our master.</p><p><br></p><p>CHUANG TZU REPLIED:</p><p>WELL, ABOVE GROUND I SHALL BE EATEN BY CROWS AND KITES,</p><p>AND BELOW GROUND BY ANTS AND WORMS. I N EITHER CASE I SHALL BE
EATEN</p><p>SO WHY ARE YOU FAVOURING THE BIRDS?</p><p>So why make any choice? I have to be taken anyhow, so why make a
choice? Chuang Tzu says: Live choicelessly, and die choicelessly. Why
make a choice? You try to manipulate life and then you try to manipulate
death also. So people make wills, legal documents, so that when they are
not, they will manipulate. Dead, but they will still manipulate.
Manipulation seems to be so enchanting that after death people go on
manipulating also. A father dies, and makes conditions in his will -
that the son will receive his inheritance only if he fulfills this
condition, else the money will go to a charity fund. But these
conditions have to be fulfilled ... the dead man dominating still.</p><p><br></p><p>The founder, and president of the trust for a hospital in London,
made his will. It read: When I die my body is not to be destroyed. It
has to be maintained and I will continue to sit in the chairman's seat.
And he still sits there. Whenever the trust meets, his dead body is
sitting in the chairman's place. He is sitting at the head of the table,
still dominating.</p><p>Your life is a manipulation of others; you would like your death also
to be a manipulation. Chuang Tzu says: There is no choice. If you leave
my body underground, well, it will be eaten. If you bury it deep down,
it will be eaten. So why favour the birds or the worms? Let it be as it
is going to happen. Let the source decide. Decision gives you ego: I
will decide.</p><p><br></p><p>So let the source decide, let the ultimate decide how it wants to
dispose of this body. I was never asked how the source had to construct
this body, why should I decide how it has to be disposed of? And why
fear that it should be eaten? It is good.</p><p>We are afraid of being eaten. Why? This is something to be
understood. Why are we so afraid of being eaten? All our lives we are
eating, and we are destroying life through eating. Whatsoever you eat,
you kill. You have to kill, because life can eat only life. There is no
other way. So nobody can really be a vegetarian, nobody. Everybody is a
non-vegetarian, because whatever you eat is life.</p><p>You eat fruit, it is life; you eat vegetables, the vegetable has
life; you eat wheat, rice, they are seeds for more life to sprout.
Whatsoever you depend on has life.</p><p>Life eats life, and everything is a food for somebody else; so why do
you protect yourself and try to ensure that you will not be eaten?
Simple foolishness! You have been eating all your life, now give it a
chance to eat you, allow life to eat you.</p><p><br></p><p>That is why I say that the Parsees have the most scientific method of
disposing of a dead body. Hindus burn it. This is bad, because you are
burning food. If every tree burns its fruit, and every animal dies and
other animals burn it, what will happen? They will all be Hindu but
there will be nobody here. Why burn? You have been eating, now allow it,
and give life a chance to eat you. And be happy about it because food
means you are being absorbed.</p><p>There is nothing wrong. It means the existence has taken back; the
river has fallen back into the ocean. And this is the best way to be
absorbed - to be eaten, so that whatsoever is useful in you is alive
somewhere in somebody. Some tree, some bird, some animal, will be alive
through your life.</p><p>Be happy, your life has been distributed. Why feel that something is
wrong with it? Mohammedans and Christians bury their dead in the ground
in caskets, in coffins, to protect. This is bad; this is just</p><p>foolishness, because we cannot protect life, so how can we protect
death? We cannot protect anything, nothing can be protected. Life is
vulnerable. And you try even to make death invulnerable. You want to
protect, to save.</p><p><br></p><p>The Parsees have the best method - they simply leave the body on the
walls, then vultures and other birds come and eat. Everyone is against
the Parsees, even Parsees, because the whole thing looks so ugly. It is
not ugly. When you are eating, is it ugly? Then why, when a vulture is
eating, is he ugly? When you eat, then it is a dinner, and when a
vulture is eating you then it is also a dinner. You have been eating
others, let others eat you, be absorbed.</p><p>So Chuang Tzu says: There is no choice, why favour this or that? Let
life do whatsoever it chooses to do, I am not going to decide.</p><p>Really, Chuang Tzu lived a choiceless life so he is ready to die a
choiceless death. And when you are choiceless, only then you are. When
you have a choice, the mind is. The mind is the chooser; the being is
always choiceless. The mind wants to do something; the being simply
allows things to happen.</p><p>Being is a let-go. How can you be miserable if you don't choose? How
can you be miserable if you don't ask for a particular result? How can
you be miserable if you are not moving to a particular goal? Nothing can
make you miserable. Your mind asks for goals, for choices, for
decisions; then misery comes in.</p><p>If you live choicelessly and allow life to happen, then you simply
become a field: life happens in you, but you are not the manager. You
don't manage it, you don't control it. When you are not the controller
all tensions dissolve; only then there is relaxation, then you are
totally relaxed.</p><p>That relaxation is the ultimate point, the alpha and the omega, the
beginning and the end.</p><p>Whether it is life or it is death, you should not take any
standpoint. That is the meaning of this story - you should not take any
standpoint. You should not say: This is right and that is wrong. You
should not divide. Let life be an undivided whole. Chuang Tzu said: If
you divide, with even one inch's division, heaven and hell are set
apart. And then they cannot be bridged.</p><p><br></p><p>I knew a young man once. He used to come to me and he was always
worried about one thing. He wanted to get married, but whatever girl he
brought home, his mother disapproved of her.</p><p>It had become almost impossible. So I told him: Try to find a girl
who is almost like your mother: face, figure, the way she walks, her
clothes. Just find a mirror image, a reflection of your mother.</p><p>He searched and searched and finally found a girl. He came to me and
said: You were right, my mother instantly liked her. She is just like my
mother; not only does she dress like my mother, she walks, talks, she
even cooks like my mother. So I asked him: Then what happened? He said:
Nothing, because my father hates her.</p><p><br></p><p>The polarity: if one part of your mind loves one thing, you can
immediately find another part of the mind hating it. If you choose one
thing, just look behind, the other part which hates is hiding there.
Whenever you choose, it is not only the world which is divided; you are
also divided through your choice. You are not whole. And when you are
not whole, you cannot allow life to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>And all benediction comes in life as grace, as a gift, it is not
achieved through effort. So don't choose religion against the world,
don't choose goodness against badness, don't choose grace against sin,
don't try to be a good man against the bad man and don't make any
distinction between the Devil and the God.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what Chuang Tzu says. He says don't choose between life and
death. Don't choose between this type of death and that type of death.
Choose not, remain whole. And whenever you are whole,</p><p>there is a meeting with the Whole, because only like meets like.</p><p>It has been said by mystics for centuries: As above, so below. I
would like to add one thing more to it: As within, so without. If you
are whole within, the Whole without happens to you immediately. If you
are divided within, the Whole without is divided. It is you who becomes
the whole universe, you become projected; it is you and whenever you
choose you will be divided. Choice means division; choice means conflict
- for this, against that.</p><p>Don't choose. Remain a choiceless witness and then nothing is
lacking. Then this existence is the most perfect existence possible.
Nothing can be more beautiful, nothing can be more blissful. It is there
all around you, waiting for you. Whenever you become aware, it will be
revealed to you. But if your mind goes on working inside, dividing,
choosing, creating conflicts, it will never happen to you. You have been
missing it for lives, don't miss it any more.</p></div></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2024 <a href=https://osho.lol/>Osho - The complete works of Osho</a></span> ·

The first question Question 1 OSHO,
I HAVE HEARD THAT JOHN THE BAPTIST NEARLY DROWNED HIS DISCIPLES
WHEN BAPTIZING THEM. IS THIS TRUE? IS THIS TYPE OF EXPERIENCE
SOMETHING THROUGH WHICH A DISCIPLE MUST PASS?
Anand Navin,
IT IS TRUE.</description>

The first question Question 1 OSHO,
PLEASE, IN THE QUESTION &#34;WHO AM I?&#34; WHAT DOES &#34;I&#34; MEAN? DOES IT
MEAN THE ESSENCE OF LIFE?
Hermann Sander,
&#34;WHO AM I?&#34; IS NOT REALLY A QUESTION because it has no answer to it;</description>

DOGO HAD A DISCIPLE CALLED SOSHIN. WHEN SOSHIN WAS TAKEN IN AS
A NOVICE, IT WAS PERHAPS NATURAL OF HIM TO EXPECT LESSONS IN ZEN
FROM HIS TEACHER THE WAY A SCHOOLBOY IS TAUGHT AT SCHOOL. BUT
DOGO GAVE HIM NO SPECIAL LESSONS ON THE SUBJECT, AND THIS BEWILDERED AND DISAPPOINTED SOSHIN.</description>

THE ANCIENTS SAID:
&#34;(SELF-)CULTIVATION TAKES AN UNIMAGINABLE TIME (WHILE) ENLIGHTENMENT IN AN INSTANT IS ATTAINED.&#34;
IF THE TRAINING IS EFFICIENT, ENLIGHTENMENT WILL BE ATTAINED IN
ONE FINGERSNAP.
IN DAYS GONE BY CH&#39;AN MASTER HUI CHUEH OF LANG YEH MOUNTAIN, HAD A DISCIPLE WHO CALLED ON HIM FOR INSTRUCTION.</description>

The first question Question 1 OSHO,
WHEN I AM WORKING IN THE WEST I FEEL LIKE AN ORANGE WARRIOR, AND I LIKE IT. WHEN I AM HERE I FEEL MEDITATIVE, AND I LIKE IT. IS THE
PART OF MYSELF THAT STILL NEEDS TO FIGHT AN OBSTACLE TO BECOMING A GOOD DISCIPLE?</description>

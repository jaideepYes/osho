Prem means love, and achinta means no anxiety. And remember that only love brings a state of no anxiety – and only love. Everything else creates a new anxiety.

And remember that only love brings a state of no anxiety – and only love. Everything else creates a new anxiety.\nYou can go on changing your anxieties – somebody is seeking money, somebody is seeking power, then somebody starts seeking god – but all things will bring anxiety. Every desire brings anxiety as a shadow to it. No desire can exist without anxiety, and anxiety is hell, anxiety is destructive, because anxiety creates a split in you – you are tom apart. You are not one piece, not together, not integrated. Only love makes you integrated.\nJesus says,‘God is love,’ and I say,‘Love is god.’ It is not enough to say that god is love, because god may be many more things. Love may be just one attribute. I say that love is god. Love is all and all. Nothing else is needed.\nThat’s why there’s so much longing for love. One wants to love and one wants to be loved, because only in love are you in tune with existence. And when you are in tune, there is no anxiety. When you are out of tune, there is anxiety. Anxiety is symptomatic that somewhere you are not moving with the whole you are moving alone. You are moving separate from the whole – maybe diametrically opposite to the whole.\nWhen you are separate you are in difficulty, because the whole cannot go with you – only you can go with the whole. And love gives you the first lesson in how to relax, how to trust, how to accept. Love gives you the first lesson in dropping the ego. When you love a person, you forget yourself. That very forgetfulness is the base of all religion.\nOnce you are in love you know who you are. Once you are in love you are in a deep contentment... a delight arises. And your lover becomes a window. Love never ends with the lover. The lover is just the beginning of love; then it goes on spreading. When you are in love you start loving all things. You cannot do otherwise. When you are in love you love the moon, you love the tree, you love the river. Suddenly you are so full of love that it goes on overflowing. When love overflows it becomes prayer.\nIn love you are lost. In prayer the other is also lost. A moment comes when there is no lover and no beloved... only love energy. That energy is delight and that energy is no anxiety. That is the goal.\nSo to remind you, I give you this name. Mm? forget everything else – never forget love! The bible, the koran, the geeta, can be forgotten – but love cannot be forgotten. That is the basic, fundamental scripture. All other scriptures are man-made. Only love is god-made.\n[Osho gives sannyas to another seeker:]\nThis will be your name... and remember that the change of the name is not an ordinary matter, because the name goes very deep into the unconscious; one becomes identified with the name. You were born without a name, then a name was given to you. That name has become very very deep- rooted. If somebody says something insulting about your name you will feel offended – although you know that you came without any name into the world. There is no necessary relationship between you and your name. You can change your name, because there is really no name – one is nameless.\nStill, if somebody insults you and says something offending you will be in a rage. If a hundred persons are sleeping in this hall and in the night somebody comes and calls somebody by name, ninety-nine percent of the people won’t listen, but the one whose name it is will simply jump and say, ‘Who is calling me?’ So even in sleep you know and remember your name. The other ninety- nine people are fast asleep – nothing has happened – but the person whose name it is suddenly becomes awake; the name goes so deep into the unconscious.\nSo when we change a name it is of tremendous import. It means dropping the whole identity that you have lived with up to now... dropping the whole idea that you have thought about yourself up to now... dropping the whole definition and starting from abc, as if you are born again. And it is not ‘as if’ – it is really so... sannyas is a rebirth.\nSo from this moment start thinking of yourself in a totally fresh way. The old is gone, the new is born, and they are not even connected. The one who was ready to take sannyas is no more. He has done his last act – he has committed suicide. Now the one who is entering into sannyas is totally different. Let it be a clean break, a breakthrough, a rift with the past... unbridgeable. That will cleanse you tremendously and you will feel very much unburdened, young, innocent... again full of wonder as every child is. That’s the miracle!\nIf you understand the meaning of the change of the name, you allow the miracle to happen. Then you don’t know who you are – you will have to learn again. You will have to learn everything from abc.\nSo the whole conditioned mind that has been functioning up to now as you is put out of gear. The new, the unfamiliar, the unknown starts. So don’t try to carry the old. Mm? just forget about it – as\nif you have read about it in a novel or you had seen a movie or somebody else had told you a story. Of course the memory will be there, but don’t get identified with it anymore. By and by the memory will go far and far away, will recede and will disappear. That is the magic of changing the name.\nAnand means bliss, the ultimate state. There are three states of being. One is pain. Many people, ninety-nine percent, live in that state – call it hell. Then pleasure, happiness, joys – rarely does one percent of people live in that. Or, people who ordinarily live in the first stage of pain, sometimes have glimpses of it – those glimpses are rare. Everybody hopes for it, but nobody lives in it.\nEverybody lives in hell and dreams of heaven. That dream helps you to live in hell. That dream makes it comfortable to live in hell. That dream becomes like a buffer, a shock-absorber, so that the pain is not too much. That dream functions as a tranquilliser. It helps you – you can tolerate the pain because you know that tomorrow there will be happiness. You can hope. Heaven is nothing but hope – and hell is reality.\nSometimes, very rarely, in a moment of beauty, love, friendship, one has a little taste of it, but that taste is very momentary – comes and goes and again the hell erupts and explodes and one is thrown in the hellfire.\nThese are the two ordinary states of the human mind – both go on changing; nothing is ultimate about them.\nThe third state is bliss. The first I call hell; the second I call heaven. In india we have a special name – which cannot be translated – for the third. We call it moksha, nirvana.\nIn the western religions there are only two things talked about – hell and heaven. That’s why I always say that christianity, judaism, islam, are poor in a way. They miss the ultimate.\nThere is a state of your consciousness where pleasure disappears, pain disappears... where nothing – no excitement – exists... neither pain nor pleasure... just pure awareness and tremendous peace. That state we call bliss, anand – and that is the goal. That is your destiny, and unless you attain it, nothing is attained. You can attain the whole world and you can possess the whole world, and nothing is possessed. You will always remain in a limbo – never certain where you are – and you will remain unaware of your being.\nSo let it be a conscious effort. Pain has to be dropped – so has pleasure. If you hanker for pleasure, pain will never be dropped – they go together. They are two aspects of the same coin. If you hanker for pleasure you will remain in pain. Sometimes, rarely, you will have a glimpse of pleasure and again you will be thrown in pain.\nDon’t hanker for pleasure because it creates only pain and nothing else. Don’t desire happiness because it creates only unhappiness and nothing else. Don’t desire success because it brings only failure and nothing else.\nOnce you have seen this game – that success brings failure and pleasure brings pain in its wake – you start on a totally different journey. Now you want to be just yourself – neither in pain nor in pleasure.\nThat’s what meditation is all about: an effort to drop pain and pleasure, the conflict and the duality, and to go deeper into oneself... just to be there without any desire for anything. In that moment of no-desire, the ultimate happens.\nDevanshu means a part of god... and everybody is a part of god. The moment you start thinking of yourself as the whole, you miss the goal. That’s what the ego is – the part deceiving itself, thinking itself to be the whole. The ego is the part claiming, pretending, to be the whole... the drop claiming to be the ocean. The drop can be the ocean, but the drop has to drop into the ocean and has to drop all claiming.\nIf you go on claiming that you are the whole, there is nowhere to go. You are already the whole, so there is no wayRemember that we are part – of course, part of god himself, because we belong\nto this whole existence – a very small part, but still part of the whole. And each single part is divine because the whole is divine. The part cannot be contrary to the whole. The part has to reflect the whole. The part has to carry the same qualities and the same attributes of the whole.\nOnce you remember that you are just a part, the ego disappears and you come to an agreement with the whole. Otherwise there is disagreement. The ego goes on fighting; it claims that it is the whole. The slave trying to claim that he is the king – then there is conflict.\nWhen you have understood that you are part, and you are happy to be the part, suddenly the conflict disappears. There arises a great agreement between the part and the wholea great harmony,\naccord and in that accord the part disappears in the whole and the whole disappears in the part. And then you are the whole.\nWhen you don’t claim, you are the whole; when you claim, you miss. Devanshu means a part of god, a part of divinity.…\nDhyana means meditation, and akampa means non-wavering.\nAnd through your name I am giving you a key – that you have to attain to a non-wavering meditation.\nThe mind is wavering, continuously wavering; it is never non-wavering. And when this wavering ceases, the mind also ceases. When there is no wavering, no-mind, there is meditation. Meditation is a state of your consciousness when there is no dualitywhen you are not going anywhere, not\nmoving at all, no movement. You are simply herenow. Just this moment exists and nothing else. There is no past and no future – otherwise there will be wavering. There is no good, no bad – otherwise there will be wavering. There is no sin, no virtue – otherwise there will be wavering.\nIf there is a duality, wavering is bound to be there. When the duality is dropped you are simply herenow in a non-dual state. Your inner flame becomes nonwavering. It is there almost like a buddha-statueno movement. So try it.\nWhen you sit, sit silently like a buddha-statue. Let the body be silent – because body and mind go together. If the body is very still, the mind tends to become still. If the body is not still, the mind also tends not to be still. And the vice versa: if the mind is still, the body tends to be still.\nSo when you are sitting, sit silently, relaxed. When you are walking, then too walk very gracefully, very alert, conscious. Only make as much movement as is absolutely needed. That’s what grace is – when you don’t make any unnecessary movement. And by cutting unnecessary movements one saves tremendous energy, and that same energy has to be used for the inner journey; you don’t have any other energy.\nEating, eat very quietly, silently. So each movement has to be done with an unmoving centre. Walk and still don’t waver. Inside remain unwavering. Talk but don’t get feverish. Remain cool, collected. And soon within a few weeks you will have a few glimpses of what I am talking about. Suddenly one day you will feel that it has happened – you are sitting there and all duality has disappeared. A great peace surrounds you and a great benediction descends – you are almost in another world.\nThat will be your first contact and the first experience of the meaning of your name. You will have to wait for it – the meaning has to be existential. Mm? I can simply indicate the meaning but the real meaning will descend on you some day.\nKrishna is one of the names of god, and one of the most beautiful concepts that has ever existed on earth. In India, Krishna is thought to be the perfect avatara of god – the perfect incarnation of god. There have been other incarnations but nobody is so perfect. And the perfection is that Krishna is the only person in the history of human consciousness who is not divided... who does not know what is good and what is bad. He is at ease with the bad as much as with the good – that is his beauty. He is not an escapist. Buddha is an escapist – he left the world. He is tremendously good... he is pure nectar. But krishna is both nectar and poison.\nHindus have called krishna’the perfect’ because if you are just nectar and no poison, you are half. You have chosen only a few things of the world – you are not total. You are not absolutely with god because you have left something renounced. God must be both.\nIn India there is no concept of the devil – not at all – because god is both: god and devil. In christianity there is a concept of god and devil... a division. The whole christian religion is schizophrenic – good and bad. Christian saint are very good but they miss something. They have no salt – tasteless, medicinal, hygienic, clinical; you can smell the hospital but they are not true to life. The flavour of life is not thereDead.\nKrishna is totally different. He lives in the world and lives, at the same time, out of the world – that’s his beauty and his perfection. He lives as ordinary human beings live and yet the world does not live in him. He lives in all the situations which can corrupt a man and he remains uncorrupted. A lotus flower remains untouched in the water. That’s his beauty.\nSo it is very difficult for the christians, for the mohammedans, for the jews, to understand krishna, mm? because there are many traits which should not be in a saint.\nAnd gopa means a girlfriend. Krishna had thirty-six thousand girlfriends. Only in India is it possible! The concept, the very concept is beautiful. Maybe it is just allegorical, because it is difficult to have thirty-six thousand girlfriends. One is enough.more than enough! Thirty-six thousand would have\nkilled the man.but the concept is beautiful. Gopa means a girlfriend.\nAnd I am giving you this name to remind you to love tremendously, love totally. Don’t negate. Go through laughter, go dancing. And become a girlfriend of god. Think of god as the beloved.\nNow, the christian idea of god as father is poor. The very word ‘father’ has no deep significance – it is institutional.\n[Osho said that the father is just a social phenomenon something that came into existence with the advent of private ownership of property. In fact the word ‘uncle’ is older than the word ‘father’ for in communities where a woman was moving with many men, the child never actually knew who his father was, so all his mother’s friends were ‘uncles’.]\nSo the christian religion depends on a very wrong concept. The father expelled adam because he disobeyed – now this is nonsense. He could not even forgive once.\nAnd now christianity goes on teaching you to forgive people – and your father, god, could not even forgive once! Adam committed a small sin – not much of a sin... a childish curiosity. And god himself was responsible because he said, ‘Don’t eat the fruit of this tree!’ When you say to a child, ‘Don’t eat the fruit of this tree,’ he is bound to – it is so natural!\nThe christian god doesn’t seem to have known any psychology. It is simple. When you say to the child,‘Don’t go to the fridge,’ he will go. You are provoking... you are challenging the child.\nWhen adam went and ate the fruit, he was thrown out, expelled, because he disobeyed. Disobedience is the first and the greatest sin because the concept is that of father and son.\nIn india the deepest concept is not of father and son but of a beloved and a lover. God should be thought of as a lover. It is more human, more intimate, close. And more wonderful... more mysterious... more romantic! And unless a religion is romantic, it is not a religion at all. Religion should be more of a romance than sex is; then only can religion succeed in the world, otherwise not.\nSo become a lover and think of god as your beloved. Think in terms of love and not in terms of logic. That is the meaning of your name.\nAnand means bliss, and chetan means consciousness; bliss consciousness. And one just has to be conscious about it to have it. It is not something that one has to seek. It is already there... it is already the case. Bliss is just your very nature. At the innermost core it is already present... present in its absolute glory. It is there in total fragrance.\nNothing has to be done to get it, and nothing has to be done to achieve it... nothing has to be done to manufacture it. It is not something that man has to manufacture – man brings it with himself. Man is born with it... it is inbuilt. The only need is to become conscious of it.\nWe are fast asleep. We are not aware of the treasure that we are carrying within ourselves – what jesus calls’the kingdom of god’. And he goes on saying,‘It is within you... it is within you.’ That’s what anand is. You have to become conscious about it.\nSo whenever you are sitting, walking, moving, meditating, dancing, just remain alert – it is there. We are missing it because we are not looking for it. There is a very profound truth that you can only find something for which you look. If you don’t look, you will not find it.\nFor example if you move in a crowd and you are not looking for me, I may be in the crowd but you may not find me. If you are looking for me you will find me, because when you look you have a direction. When you look, you have a conscious effort.\nIf a painter comes into the garden he will see many colours – which you will not see – because he was looking for them; they are there. When a painter looks at the trees he sees many types of green. All trees look green, but when a painter sees it, there are tremendous differences between one green and another. There are as many greens as there are trees – different shades and different nuances.\nWhen you are looking for colours you will see them. When a musician comes into the same garden he will hear the subtle noises. He will be able to hear these insects. Because he has an ear, he is looking for it; he is consciously searching.\nWhat I mean by chetan, by being conscious, is only this: that you should remain alert... that it is already there. You are not yet in contact with it but it is there. So remain alert. Dancing, singing, walking, eating, remain alert. Again and again remind yourself that it is there. You have brought it from god himself... it is part of you.\nOne day suddenly the contact happens. And it happens out of the blue, unpredictable. Nobody knows when it will happen. Nobody can say anything about it, but it happens. When you look for it and you go on looking for it, you go on waiting for it – one day it happens. You go on striking again and again and hammering and hammering, and one day suddenly it is there.…\n[A visitor had previously written to Osho, confessing he was a con-man and hustler. He had asked Osho to help him put his abilities to positive ends.]\nHello,... come here. So you have come! Very good. This time don’t try to escape. Your whole life you have been escaping. There were many possibilities, many timesBut it is natural – one\nmisses many times. But enough is enough! Now you have come home – don’t try to escape.\nAnd let it be a total thing, because less than that won’t help. Less than that won’t go deep enough. Only something total can be helpful to you. Because you are clever and very intelligent – and there is a danger with intelligence; it can deceive itself.\nIntelligence is a great gift, but with all gifts there is always a danger. That comes with the gift; that is part of it. That is the price we pay for it. No gift comes without danger. So nothing is wrong in it. Everybody who has a gift will misuse it – that’s a necessary training in life. You have misused it enough.and now you have understood it also. So now let it be a one-hundred-and-eighty degree\nturn. Once you take the turn, the same intelligence can be used tremendously creatively.\nAnd don’t feel guilty – because it had to be so. Now there is no point in feeling guilty. As far as I understand, in this life when we are not awake, there are only two possibilities: either you will cheat or you will be cheated.and both are wrong. These are the only two possibilities.\nUnconscious people will either be cheated or will cheat. And if one has to choose, it is better to be the cheater rather than the cheated, because the cheater one day will understand and will be\nable to get out of it; the cheated will never understand. The cheated will never feel that he has done something wrong – because he has never done anything wrong! Others have done wrong to him. So he has grudges against others – but what can you do against others? He will never feel responsible for his own life.\nThe cheater one day or other will see something has gone wrong, and that is the day the turning comes, the conversion.\nSo as I see it, whatsoever has happened, has happened... and it was good. In fact, it has brought you to me, otherwise you would not have been here.\nThis is another beauty of life – that even wrong things fit perfectly in the total. That’s why I never condemn anything – there is no point – because if you look at the total, everything fits so perfectly.\nSo if you look at the total, nothing is wrong. Only the total result counts. If this conversion happens you will understand that all that happened before it was a necessary part, a preparation for it.\nAnd now let it be total. Half hearted measures never help anybody. And I know it is going to happen.\n... This will be your name... and with this change of name you cut yourself from the past with one stroke of the sword, with one blow. There is no need to be gradual, and a gradual thing is not going to help you... only a sudden break. So dare the sudden, and with one blow of the sword simply die to the past... as if it has never existed.\nBecome absolutely new – whatsoever the risk and the cost; that’s not the point. Games you have enjoyed enough – now for this last part of life be real, and play the ultimate game of being real.\nYes, being phoney pays – that’s why people are phoney – but being real pays tremendously. That’s why one day or other everybody has to come to the real. You can have the whole world, but if you don’t have your own reality you are a beggar. You may lose the whole world, but if you have got contact with your being you are an emperor. And by giving sannyas I don’t make beggars – I make emperors.\nMy whole effort here is not to create poor people, but to create infinitely rich people – rich in the soul, rich in creativity, rich in love, rich in awareness... rich in all the dimensions possible.\nThis will be your name: Swami Prem Nirvana.\nPrem means love, nirvana means enlightenment. And these two things are going to happen.Love\nis going to happen, nirvana is going to happen.…\nThe word is buddhist and has a very particular meaning. It means’blowing out the candle’. It is a tremendously significant word. Buddha calls enlightenment ‘blowing out the candle’ – the candle of the ego, the candle of ‘I’. It is very small and gives a very yellow light and it is very smoky, but we become too much attached to it. Not much light comes out of it either but still we become attached to it. When one blows out this candle, the ego disappears.\nFor a moment there is immense darkness – that is because of the old habit. We miss the candle and our eyes are focused on it and on its small light, its tiny light, but by and by the darkness disappears; more and more light comes. But that light is not ours – that light is of god, of the whole.\nThen we live in light, but that light is not ours. Then we move, do things, but we are no more the doer. Then we have no will of our own – that has been blown out. Now whatsoever god wills, it happens.\nThat’s what Jesus says on the cross. For a moment he had wavered. Christians have not analysed it. In fact christianity has not been able to bring jesus in his real perfume to the world.\nOn the cross he wavered for a single moment and he said in agony and with deep complaint,‘Have you forsaken me, my lord? My god, have you forsaken me? What is this that you are doing to me?’\nFor a moment his ego takes hold of him and then he understands immediately that this is not right – what is he saying? Is this his own will against god’s? For one moment jesus said,’I don’t will thisI\ndon’t want this. What are you doing? Have you forsaken me?’ He understood it. He was a man of tremendous awareness. And in a single moment he blew out the candle and he said,‘No, don’t listen to me. Who am I? Thy will be done, not mine.’\nJust a moment before, he was jesus, son of joseph and mary. In a single moment, in a split moment, he is no more Jesus – he is Christ. The candle is blown out.… He has become a buddha. ‘Thy will be done’ – that is the meaning of nirvana. So simply surrender.\nAnd don’t carry these ideas that you have done something wrong or you should not have done this or that; that’s pointless. In unawareness everybody is doing wrong. Either you do wrong or you allow somebody else to do it to you. Both are wrong.\nTo exploit people is wrong, to be exploited is as much wrong – both are wrong. But in unconsciousness, what can you do?\nAn unconscious person is not really responsible – cannot be – but from now the first ray of consciousness has arisen in you; now you will be responsible. Only with consciousness does one become responsibleand to be responsible is to be religious.\nI call these the two r’s of religion: responsibility and relationship. Only a conscious person can have relationship. Others only pretend or others only think that they have relationships. They cannot have, because to relate you need tremendous awareness.\nAnd only a conscious person can have responsibility. I don’t say to do good and not to do bad. I simply say to be responsible, and that’s enough! A responsible person has never done anything bad – cannot do, by his very nature. So that is not the point – good, bad; that is not the point.\nNow I make you responsible. This is just a small ray – it will grow. It will become more and more and it will become a vast, tremendous light in your being.\nAnd I blow the candle out, so the old is completely gone – finished! Never think about it again – it is none of your business any more.\nDeva means divine, and agochara means invisible. God is invisible. He is present. He is present in everything, everywhere – but invisible. His presence is almost like absence... and that is the beauty. Just think, if god were visible it would have been a very ugly world, because if god were visible there would be no freedom left. It is his invisibility that becomes human freedom. Otherwise how would you go astray?\nIf you wanted to do something wrong it would have been impossible. He would have been present everywhere. He would have looked at you from the flower. He would have looked at your from the stone and he would have looked at you from the stars. He would have looked at you from the child and from the animal and the dog, and it would have been impossible to live! He would have been everywhere! So visible, it would have been a torture, a nightmare.\nIn his compassion he is present and yet invisible, so that you can forget him, so that he doesn’t become an interference in your way... so that if you choose to go astray, you can go. Your freedom remains absolute. Even if you want to go against him he is not going to interfere. This is tremendous compassion – that gives you total freedom... even to go against him.\nIf somebody wants to be an atheist, he is free to be an atheist. If god were visible it would be very difficult. Mm? just thinkLife would have been impossible.\nBut he is present. His presence is like absence, but he is present. So he becomes visible only to those who look for him intently. He becomes visible only to those who are really in search of him. He does not come in your way, but if you look for him you will find a way to find him. A tremendous quality, a very intense desire to look for him, is needed.Then your eyes are transfigured. You start\nlooking into the inside of things. Then a rock is not just a rock – it is full of god!\nIt is said that in Michaelangelo’s life, it happened that he was passing by a marble shop and there were many marble stones there. One big rock had just been thrown out of the shop and he had seen it there for many days. So he asked the shop-owner, ’What is the matter? Why have you thrown this rock? I would like to purchase it.\nThe shopkeeper was very happy – he said, ‘You can have it, and you need not pay anything to me because I don’t think that I can ever find a purchaser for it; that’s why I have thrown it away. You can take it! It is yours just for the asking.’\nMichaelangelo took away the rock. After a few months he invited the shop-owner to see what had happened to the rock. The shopkeeper could not believe his eyes. A beautiful jesus, a tremendously beautiful jesus had come out... a very alive jesus. You could almost touch him and feel him. There was a feeling that he was breathing and that he was looking at you.\nThe shopkeeper said,‘What have you done? This is a miracle! And out of that rotten rock!’ And Michaelangelo said,‘Now, at least, don’t say that.’\n‘But how could you do it?’ he asked.\nMichaelangelo said,‘I have not done anything. When I was passing, jesus called me. He said, “I have been encaged in this rock for many many years – thousands of years – and only you can release me.” I have simply helped him to come out, that’s all!’\nOnce you have an eye to see god, you will find him in every rock, ready to be released. You can touch him and you will feel his breathing. You can touch him and you will feel his warmth. You can touch him and you will feel his response.\nBut that happens only when you really look for him, otherwise not. When you put your total energy into looking, when your whole life energy flows through your eyes... when the intensity is total – more you cannot do – then he is there, visible. Ordinarily he is invisible.\nI give you this name: deva agochara... god invisible. I give you this name as a challenge. He has to be made gochara – he has to be made visible. I give you this rock... you have to release god from it. And I can see it.Just a little effort, just a little longing, just a little more thirst, and things will start\nhappening.\n[The new sannyasin says that in the West he was doing painting.]\nVery good. That’s the right thing to do! That’s very good. My feeling is always for people who are creative, because to me only a creative person can be religious. Non-creative persons cannot be religious. Because god is the creator, and only by being, do you participate with him, otherwise not. If your worship is non-creative it is not going to help. If your prayer is non-creative it is not going to help.\nYou can go on doing all the rituals prescribed by all the religions of the world, and they will be just impotent gestures unless you create something – a poem, a painting, a sculptureunless\nyou do something in the way god is creating. So you have to become creativeof course on a\nsmaller scale. God has painted the whole world with tremendous colour – it is not a grey world; it is psychedelic.\nHis creativity is infinite; he never repeats anything again. His originality seems to be incredible. He has never recreated a single thing again. He has never created a man like you before and he will never create again. He creates only unique human beingsunique trees. You cannot find one tree\nsimilar to another tree – impossible!\nIf you take one leaf of a tree, you cannot find a second leaf exactly like it on the whole of the earth. Of course his infinitude, his creativity, has no beginning, no end. But when a man becomes in his own small measure, in his own small way, creative, he participates. He throbs with god’s being.he\nbreathes with him. He pulsates in those moments with his life: in those moments he is not himself.\nThat’s why creators always feel shy when they have to sign their paintings or their poetryvery shy.\nOnly mediocres don’t feel shy. Creators always feel, ‘How to sign it? I have been just an instrument. Something has happened through me, but I have not done anything.’\nCreativity is not your doing. It is as if you allow god to do something through you.it is a let-go. But\nin those few moments one is prayerful.\nAnd this has been a calamity on the earth – that up to now religions have not been very creative. They attracted non-creative people; they attracted negative people. They attracted, somehow, pathological people. So religion up to now has been more or less pathological. It has not been life-affirmative. It has not been ecstatic and not creative.\nMy whole effort here is to bring a totally new religion into the world – a religion of creativity... a religion which can sing and dance... a religion which can love.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6294","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_buddha_disease/part14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_buddha_disease/>The Buddha Disease</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">14 Go to God through laughter, through dancing</h1><div class=post-meta>30 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6294 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Buddha_Disease/part14.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

And remember that only
love brings a state of no anxiety – and only love. Everything else
creates a new anxiety.</p><p><br></p><p>You can go on changing your anxieties – somebody is seeking money,
somebody is seeking power, then somebody starts seeking god – but all
things will bring anxiety. Every desire brings anxiety as a shadow to
it. No desire can exist without anxiety, and anxiety is hell, anxiety is
destructive, because anxiety creates a split in you – you are tom apart.
You are not one piece, not together, not integrated. Only love makes you
integrated.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says,‘God is love,’ and I say,‘Love is god.’ It is not enough
to say that god is love, because god may be many more things. Love may
be just one attribute. I say that love is god. Love is all and all.
Nothing else is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why there’s so much longing for love. One wants to love and
one wants to be loved, because only in love are you in tune with
existence. And when you are in tune, there is no anxiety. When you are
out of tune, there is anxiety. Anxiety is symptomatic that somewhere you
are not moving with the whole you are moving alone. You are moving
separate from the whole – maybe diametrically opposite to the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are separate you are in difficulty, because the whole cannot
go with you – only you can go with the whole. And love gives you the
first lesson in how to relax, how to trust, how to accept. Love gives
you the first lesson in dropping the ego. When you love a person, you
forget yourself. That very forgetfulness is the base of all
religion.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you are in love you know who you are. Once you are in love you
are in a deep contentment... a delight arises. And your lover becomes a
window. Love never ends with the lover. The lover is just the beginning
of love; then it goes on spreading. When you are in love you start
loving all things. You cannot do otherwise. When you are in love you
love the moon, you love the tree, you love the river. Suddenly you are
so full of love that it goes on overflowing. When love overflows it
becomes prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>In love you are lost. In prayer the other is also lost. A moment
comes when there is no lover and no beloved... only love energy. That
energy is delight and that energy is no anxiety. That is the goal.</p><p><br></p><p>So to remind you, I give you this name. Mm? forget everything else –
never forget love! The bible, the koran, the geeta, can be forgotten –
but love cannot be forgotten. That is the basic, fundamental scripture.
All other scriptures are man-made. Only love is god-made.</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho gives sannyas to another seeker:]</p><p><br></p><p>This will be your name... and remember that the change of the name is
not an ordinary matter, because the name goes very deep into the
unconscious; one becomes identified with the name. You were born without
a name, then a name was given to you. That name has become very very
deep- rooted. If somebody says something insulting about your name you
will feel offended – although you know that you came without any name
into the world. There is no necessary relationship between you and your
name. You can change your name, because there is really no name – one is
nameless.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, if somebody insults you and says something offending you will
be in a rage. If a hundred persons are sleeping in this hall and in the
night somebody comes and calls somebody by name, ninety-nine percent of
the people won’t listen, but the one whose name it is will simply jump
and say, ‘Who is calling me?’ So even in sleep you know and remember
your name. The other ninety- nine people are fast asleep – nothing has
happened – but the person whose name it is suddenly becomes awake; the
name goes so deep into the unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>So when we change a name it is of tremendous import. It means
dropping the whole identity that you have lived with up to now...
dropping the whole idea that you have thought about yourself up to
now... dropping the whole definition and starting from abc, as if you
are born again. And it is not ‘as if’ – it is really so... sannyas is a
rebirth.</p><p><br></p><p>So from this moment start thinking of yourself in a totally fresh
way. The old is gone, the new is born, and they are not even connected.
The one who was ready to take sannyas is no more. He has done his last
act – he has committed suicide. Now the one who is entering into sannyas
is totally different. Let it be a clean break, a breakthrough, a rift
with the past... unbridgeable. That will cleanse you tremendously and
you will feel very much unburdened, young, innocent... again full of
wonder as every child is. That’s the miracle!</p><p><br></p><p>If you understand the meaning of the change of the name, you allow
the miracle to happen. Then you don’t know who you are – you will have
to learn again. You will have to learn everything from abc.</p><p><br></p><p>So the whole conditioned mind that has been functioning up to now as
you is put out of gear. The new, the unfamiliar, the unknown starts. So
don’t try to carry the old. Mm? just forget about it – as</p><p><br></p><p>if you have read about it in a novel or you had seen a movie or
somebody else had told you a story. Of course the memory will be there,
but don’t get identified with it anymore. By and by the memory will go
far and far away, will recede and will disappear. That is the magic of
changing the name.</p><p><br></p><p>Anand means bliss, the ultimate state. There are three states of
being. One is pain. Many people, ninety-nine percent, live in that state
– call it hell. Then pleasure, happiness, joys – rarely does one percent
of people live in that. Or, people who ordinarily live in the first
stage of pain, sometimes have glimpses of it – those glimpses are rare.
Everybody hopes for it, but nobody lives in it.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody lives in hell and dreams of heaven. That dream helps you to
live in hell. That dream makes it comfortable to live in hell. That
dream becomes like a buffer, a shock-absorber, so that the pain is not
too much. That dream functions as a tranquilliser. It helps you – you
can tolerate the pain because you know that tomorrow there will be
happiness. You can hope. Heaven is nothing but hope – and hell is
reality.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes, very rarely, in a moment of beauty, love, friendship, one
has a little taste of it, but that taste is very momentary – comes and
goes and again the hell erupts and explodes and one is thrown in the
hellfire.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the two ordinary states of the human mind – both go on
changing; nothing is ultimate about them.</p><p><br></p><p>The third state is bliss. The first I call hell; the second I call
heaven. In india we have a special name – which cannot be translated –
for the third. We call it moksha, nirvana.</p><p><br></p><p>In the western religions there are only two things talked about –
hell and heaven. That’s why I always say that christianity, judaism,
islam, are poor in a way. They miss the ultimate.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a state of your consciousness where pleasure disappears,
pain disappears... where nothing – no excitement – exists... neither
pain nor pleasure... just pure awareness and tremendous peace. That
state we call bliss, anand – and that is the goal. That is your destiny,
and unless you attain it, nothing is attained. You can attain the whole
world and you can possess the whole world, and nothing is possessed. You
will always remain in a limbo – never certain where you are – and you
will remain unaware of your being.</p><p><br></p><p>So let it be a conscious effort. Pain has to be dropped – so has
pleasure. If you hanker for pleasure, pain will never be dropped – they
go together. They are two aspects of the same coin. If you hanker for
pleasure you will remain in pain. Sometimes, rarely, you will have a
glimpse of pleasure and again you will be thrown in pain.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t hanker for pleasure because it creates only pain and nothing
else. Don’t desire happiness because it creates only unhappiness and
nothing else. Don’t desire success because it brings only failure and
nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you have seen this game – that success brings failure and
pleasure brings pain in its wake – you start on a totally different
journey. Now you want to be just yourself – neither in pain nor in
pleasure.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what meditation is all about: an effort to drop pain and
pleasure, the conflict and the duality, and to go deeper into oneself...
just to be there without any desire for anything. In that moment of
no-desire, the ultimate happens.</p><p><br></p><p>Devanshu means a part of god... and everybody is a part of god. The
moment you start thinking of yourself as the whole, you miss the goal.
That’s what the ego is – the part deceiving itself, thinking itself to
be the whole. The ego is the part claiming, pretending, to be the
whole... the drop claiming to be the ocean. The drop can be the ocean,
but the drop has to drop into the ocean and has to drop all
claiming.</p><p><br></p><p>If you go on claiming that you are the whole, there is nowhere to go.
You are already the whole, so there is no way<span class=s4></span>Remember that we are part – of course, part of god
himself, because we belong</p><p>to this whole existence – a very small part, but still part of the
whole. And each single part is divine because the whole is divine. The
part cannot be contrary to the whole. The part has to reflect the whole.
The part has to carry the same qualities and the same attributes of the
whole.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you remember that you are just a part, the ego disappears and
you come to an agreement with the whole. Otherwise there is
disagreement. The ego goes on fighting; it claims that it is the whole.
The slave trying to claim that he is the king – then there is
conflict.</p><p><br></p><p>When you have understood that you are part, and you are happy to be
the part, suddenly the conflict disappears. There arises a great
agreement between the part and the whole<span class=s4></span>a great
harmony,</p><p>accord and in that accord the part disappears in the whole and the
whole disappears in the part. And then you are the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>When you don’t claim, you are the whole; when you claim, you miss.
Devanshu means a part of god, a part of divinity.…</p><p><br></p><p>Dhyana means meditation, and akampa means non-wavering.</p><p><br></p><p>And through your name I am giving you a key – that you have to attain
to a non-wavering meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind is wavering, continuously wavering; it is never
non-wavering. And when this wavering ceases, the mind also ceases. When
there is no wavering, no-mind, there is meditation. Meditation is a
state of your consciousness when there is no duality<span class=s4></span>when you are not going anywhere, not</p><p>moving at all, no movement. You are simply herenow. Just this moment
exists and nothing else. There is no past and no future – otherwise
there will be wavering. There is no good, no bad – otherwise there will
be wavering. There is no sin, no virtue – otherwise there will be
wavering.</p><p><br></p><p>If there is a duality, wavering is bound to be there. When the
duality is dropped you are simply herenow in a non-dual state. Your
inner flame becomes nonwavering. It is there almost like a
buddha-statue<span class=s4></span>no movement. So try it.</p><p><br></p><p>When you sit, sit silently like a buddha-statue. Let the body be
silent – because body and mind go together. If the body is very still,
the mind tends to become still. If the body is not still, the mind also
tends not to be still. And the vice versa: if the mind is still, the
body tends to be still.</p><p><br></p><p>So when you are sitting, sit silently, relaxed. When you are walking,
then too walk very gracefully, very alert, conscious. Only make as much
movement as is absolutely needed. That’s what grace is – when you don’t
make any unnecessary movement. And by cutting unnecessary movements one
saves tremendous energy, and that same energy has to be used for the
inner journey; you don’t have any other energy.</p><p><br></p><p>Eating, eat very quietly, silently. So each movement has to be done
with an unmoving centre. Walk and still don’t waver. Inside remain
unwavering. Talk but don’t get feverish. Remain cool, collected. And
soon within a few weeks you will have a few glimpses of what I am
talking about. Suddenly one day you will feel that it has happened – you
are sitting there and all duality has disappeared. A great peace
surrounds you and a great benediction descends – you are almost in
another world.</p><p><br></p><p>That will be your first contact and the first experience of the
meaning of your name. You will have to wait for it – the meaning has to
be existential. Mm? I can simply indicate the meaning but the real
meaning will descend on you some day.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna is one of the names of god, and one of the most beautiful
concepts that has ever existed on earth. In India, Krishna is thought to
be the perfect avatara of god – the perfect incarnation of god. There
have been other incarnations but nobody is so perfect. And the
perfection is that Krishna is the only person in the history of human
consciousness who is not divided... who does not know what is good and
what is bad. He is at ease with the bad as much as with the good – that
is his beauty. He is not an escapist. Buddha is an escapist – he left
the world. He is tremendously good... he is pure nectar. But krishna is
both nectar and poison.</p><p><br></p><p>Hindus have called krishna’the perfect’ because if you are just
nectar and no poison, you are half. You have chosen only a few things of
the world – you are not total. You are not absolutely with god because
you have left something renounced. God must be both.</p><p><br></p><p>In India there is no concept of the devil – not at all – because god
is both: god and devil. In christianity there is a concept of god and
devil... a division. The whole christian religion is schizophrenic –
good and bad. Christian saint are very good but they miss something.
They have no salt – tasteless, medicinal, hygienic, clinical; you can
smell the hospital but they are not true to life. The flavour of life is
not there<span class=s4></span>Dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna is totally different. He lives in the world and lives, at the
same time, out of the world – that’s his beauty and his perfection. He
lives as ordinary human beings live and yet the world does not live in
him. He lives in all the situations which can corrupt a man and he
remains uncorrupted. A lotus flower remains untouched in the water.
That’s his beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is very difficult for the christians, for the mohammedans, for
the jews, to understand krishna, mm? because there are many traits which
should not be in a saint.</p><p><br></p><p>And gopa means a girlfriend. Krishna had thirty-six thousand
girlfriends. Only in India is it possible! The concept, the very concept
is beautiful. Maybe it is just allegorical, because it is difficult to
have thirty-six thousand girlfriends. One is enough.<span class=s4></span>more than enough! Thirty-six thousand would have</p><p>killed the man.<span class=s4></span>but the concept is beautiful.
Gopa means a girlfriend.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am giving you this name to remind you to love tremendously,
love totally. Don’t negate. Go through laughter, go dancing. And become
a girlfriend of god. Think of god as the beloved.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, the christian idea of god as father is poor. The very word
‘father’ has no deep significance – it is institutional.</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho said that the father is just a social phenomenon something that
came into existence with the advent of private ownership of property. In
fact the word ‘uncle’ is older than the word ‘father’ for in communities
where a woman was moving with many men, the child never actually knew
who his father was, so all his mother’s friends were ‘uncles’.]</p><p><br></p><p>So the christian religion depends on a very wrong concept. The father
expelled adam because he disobeyed – now this is nonsense. He could not
even forgive once.</p><p><br></p><p>And now christianity goes on teaching you to forgive people – and
your father, god, could not even forgive once! Adam committed a small
sin – not much of a sin... a childish curiosity. And god himself was
responsible because he said, ‘Don’t eat the fruit of this tree!’ When
you say to a child, ‘Don’t eat the fruit of this tree,’ he is bound to –
it is so natural!</p><p>The christian god doesn’t seem to have known any psychology. It is
simple. When you say to the child,‘Don’t go to the fridge,’ he will go.
You are provoking... you are challenging the child.</p><p><br></p><p>When adam went and ate the fruit, he was thrown out, expelled,
because he disobeyed. Disobedience is the first and the greatest sin
because the concept is that of father and son.</p><p><br></p><p>In india the deepest concept is not of father and son but of a
beloved and a lover. God should be thought of as a lover. It is more
human, more intimate, close. And more wonderful... more mysterious...
more romantic! And unless a religion is romantic, it is not a religion
at all. Religion should be more of a romance than sex is; then only can
religion succeed in the world, otherwise not.</p><p>So become a lover and think of god as your beloved. Think in terms of
love and not in terms of logic. That is the meaning of your name.</p><p><br></p><p>Anand means bliss, and chetan means consciousness; bliss
consciousness. And one just has to be conscious about it to have it. It
is not something that one has to seek. It is already there... it is
already the case. Bliss is just your very nature. At the innermost core
it is already present... present in its absolute glory. It is there in
total fragrance.</p><p>Nothing has to be done to get it, and nothing has to be done to
achieve it... nothing has to be done to manufacture it. It is not
something that man has to manufacture – man brings it with himself. Man
is born with it... it is inbuilt. The only need is to become conscious
of it.</p><p><br></p><p>We are fast asleep. We are not aware of the treasure that we are
carrying within ourselves – what jesus calls’the kingdom of god’. And he
goes on saying,‘It is within you... it is within you.’ That’s what anand
is. You have to become conscious about it.</p><p><br></p><p>So whenever you are sitting, walking, moving, meditating, dancing,
just remain alert – it is there. We are missing it because we are not
looking for it. There is a very profound truth that you can only find
something for which you look. If you don’t look, you will not find
it.</p><p><br></p><p>For example if you move in a crowd and you are not looking for me, I
may be in the crowd but you may not find me. If you are looking for me
you will find me, because when you look you have a direction. When you
look, you have a conscious effort.</p><p><br></p><p>If a painter comes into the garden he will see many colours – which
you will not see – because he was looking for them; they are there. When
a painter looks at the trees he sees many types of green. All trees look
green, but when a painter sees it, there are tremendous differences
between one green and another. There are as many greens as there are
trees – different shades and different nuances.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are looking for colours you will see them. When a musician
comes into the same garden he will hear the subtle noises. He will be
able to hear these insects. Because he has an ear, he is looking for it;
he is consciously searching.</p><p><br></p><p>What I mean by chetan, by being conscious, is only this: that you
should remain alert... that it is already there. You are not yet in
contact with it but it is there. So remain alert. Dancing, singing,
walking, eating, remain alert. Again and again remind yourself that it
is there. You have brought it from god himself... it is part of you.</p><p><br></p><p>One day suddenly the contact happens. And it happens out of the blue,
unpredictable. Nobody knows when it will happen. Nobody can say anything
about it, but it happens. When you look for it and you go on looking for
it, you go on waiting for it – one day it happens. You go on striking
again and again and hammering and hammering, and one day suddenly it is
there.…</p><p><br></p><p>[A visitor had previously written to Osho, confessing he was a
con-man and hustler. He had asked Osho to help him put his abilities to
positive ends.]</p><p><br></p><p>Hello,... come here. So you have come! Very good. This time don’t try
to escape. Your whole life you have been escaping. There were many
possibilities, many times<span class=s4></span>But it is natural –
one</p><p>misses many times. But enough is enough! Now you have come home –
don’t try to escape.</p><p><br></p><p>And let it be a total thing, because less than that won’t help. Less
than that won’t go deep enough. Only something total can be helpful to
you. Because you are clever and very intelligent – and there is a danger
with intelligence; it can deceive itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Intelligence is a great gift, but with all gifts there is always a
danger. That comes with the gift; that is part of it. That is the price
we pay for it. No gift comes without danger. So nothing is wrong in it.
Everybody who has a gift will misuse it – that’s a necessary training in
life. You have misused it enough.<span class=s4></span>and now you
have understood it also. So now let it be a one-hundred-and-eighty
degree</p><p>turn. Once you take the turn, the same intelligence can be used
tremendously creatively.</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t feel guilty – because it had to be so. Now there is no
point in feeling guilty. As far as I understand, in this life when we
are not awake, there are only two possibilities: either you will cheat
or you will be cheated.<span class=s4></span>and both are wrong. These
are the only two possibilities.</p><p><br></p><p>Unconscious people will either be cheated or will cheat. And if one
has to choose, it is better to be the cheater rather than the cheated,
because the cheater one day will understand and will be</p><p><br></p><p>able to get out of it; the cheated will never understand. The cheated
will never feel that he has done something wrong – because he has never
done anything wrong! Others have done wrong to him. So he has grudges
against others – but what can you do against others? He will never feel
responsible for his own life.</p><p><br></p><p>The cheater one day or other will see something has gone wrong, and
that is the day the turning comes, the conversion.</p><p><br></p><p>So as I see it, whatsoever has happened, has happened... and it was
good. In fact, it has brought you to me, otherwise you would not have
been here.</p><p><br></p><p>This is another beauty of life – that even wrong things fit perfectly
in the total. That’s why I never condemn anything – there is no point –
because if you look at the total, everything fits so perfectly.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you look at the total, nothing is wrong. Only the total result
counts. If this conversion happens you will understand that all that
happened before it was a necessary part, a preparation for it.</p><p><br></p><p>And now let it be total. Half hearted measures never help anybody.
And I know it is going to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>... This will be your name... and with this change of name you cut
yourself from the past with one stroke of the sword, with one blow.
There is no need to be gradual, and a gradual thing is not going to help
you... only a sudden break. So dare the sudden, and with one blow of the
sword simply die to the past... as if it has never existed.</p><p><br></p><p>Become absolutely new – whatsoever the risk and the cost; that’s not
the point. Games you have enjoyed enough – now for this last part of
life be real, and play the ultimate game of being real.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, being phoney pays – that’s why people are phoney – but being
real pays tremendously. That’s why one day or other everybody has to
come to the real. You can have the whole world, but if you don’t have
your own reality you are a beggar. You may lose the whole world, but if
you have got contact with your being you are an emperor. And by giving
sannyas I don’t make beggars – I make emperors.</p><p><br></p><p>My whole effort here is not to create poor people, but to create
infinitely rich people – rich in the soul, rich in creativity, rich in
love, rich in awareness... rich in all the dimensions possible.</p><p><br></p><p>This will be your name: Swami Prem Nirvana.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem means love, nirvana means enlightenment. And these two things
are going to happen.<span class=s4></span>Love</p><p>is going to happen, nirvana is going to happen.…</p><p><br></p><p>The word is buddhist and has a very particular meaning. It
means’blowing out the candle’. It is a tremendously significant word.
Buddha calls enlightenment ‘blowing out the candle’ – the candle of the
ego, the candle of ‘I’. It is very small and gives a very yellow light
and it is very smoky, but we become too much attached to it. Not much
light comes out of it either but still we become attached to it. When
one blows out this candle, the ego disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>For a moment there is immense darkness – that is because of the old
habit. We miss the candle and our eyes are focused on it and on its
small light, its tiny light, but by and by the darkness disappears; more
and more light comes. But that light is not ours – that light is of god,
of the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>Then we live in light, but that light is not ours. Then we move, do
things, but we are no more the doer. Then we have no will of our own –
that has been blown out. Now whatsoever god wills, it happens.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what Jesus says on the cross. For a moment he had wavered.
Christians have not analysed it. In fact christianity has not been able
to bring jesus in his real perfume to the world.</p><p><br></p><p>On the cross he wavered for a single moment and he said in agony and
with deep complaint,‘Have you forsaken me, my lord? My god, have you
forsaken me? What is this that you are doing to me?’</p><p>For a moment his ego takes hold of him and then he understands
immediately that this is not right – what is he saying? Is this his own
will against god’s? For one moment jesus said,’I don’t will this<span class=s4></span>I</p><p>don’t want this. What are you doing? Have you forsaken me?’ He
understood it. He was a man of tremendous awareness. And in a single
moment he blew out the candle and he said,‘No, don’t listen to me. Who
am I? Thy will be done, not mine.’</p><p>Just a moment before, he was jesus, son of joseph and mary. In a
single moment, in a split moment, he is no more Jesus – he is Christ.
The candle is blown out.… He has become a buddha. ‘Thy will be done’ –
that is the meaning of nirvana. So simply surrender.</p><p>And don’t carry these ideas that you have done something wrong or you
should not have done this or that; that’s pointless. In unawareness
everybody is doing wrong. Either you do wrong or you allow somebody else
to do it to you. Both are wrong.</p><p>To exploit people is wrong, to be exploited is as much wrong – both
are wrong. But in unconsciousness, what can you do?</p><p>An unconscious person is not really responsible – cannot be – but
from now the first ray of consciousness has arisen in you; now you will
be responsible. Only with consciousness does one become responsible<span class=s4></span>and to be responsible is to be religious.</p><p>I call these the two r’s of religion: responsibility and
relationship. Only a conscious person can have relationship. Others only
pretend or others only think that they have relationships. They cannot
have, because to relate you need tremendous awareness.</p><p>And only a conscious person can have responsibility. I don’t say to
do good and not to do bad. I simply say to be responsible, and that’s
enough! A responsible person has never done anything bad – cannot do, by
his very nature. So that is not the point – good, bad; that is not the
point.</p><p>Now I make you responsible. This is just a small ray – it will grow.
It will become more and more and it will become a vast, tremendous light
in your being.</p><p>And I blow the candle out, so the old is completely gone – finished!
Never think about it again – it is none of your business any more.</p><p>Deva means divine, and agochara means invisible. God is invisible. He
is present. He is present in everything, everywhere – but invisible. His
presence is almost like absence... and that is the beauty. Just think,
if god were visible it would have been a very ugly world, because if god
were visible there would be no freedom left. It is his invisibility that
becomes human freedom. Otherwise how would you go astray?</p><p>If you wanted to do something wrong it would have been impossible. He
would have been present everywhere. He would have looked at you from the
flower. He would have looked at your from the stone and he would have
looked at you from the stars. He would have looked at you from the child
and from the animal and the dog, and it would have been impossible to
live! He would have been everywhere! So visible, it would have been a
torture, a nightmare.</p><p>In his compassion he is present and yet invisible, so that you can
forget him, so that he doesn’t become an interference in your way... so
that if you choose to go astray, you can go. Your freedom remains
absolute. Even if you want to go against him he is not going to
interfere. This is tremendous compassion – that gives you total
freedom... even to go against him.</p><p>If somebody wants to be an atheist, he is free to be an atheist. If
god were visible it would be very difficult. Mm? just think<span class=s4></span>Life would have been impossible.</p><p>But he is present. His presence is like absence, but he is present.
So he becomes visible only to those who look for him intently. He
becomes visible only to those who are really in search of him. He does
not come in your way, but if you look for him you will find a way to
find him. A tremendous quality, a very intense desire to look for him,
is needed.<span class=s4></span>Then your eyes are transfigured. You
start</p><p>looking into the inside of things. Then a rock is not just a rock –
it is full of god!</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that in Michaelangelo’s life, it happened that he was
passing by a marble shop and there were many marble stones there. One
big rock had just been thrown out of the shop and he had seen it there
for many days. So he asked the shop-owner, ’What is the matter? Why have
you thrown this rock? I would like to purchase it.</p><p>The shopkeeper was very happy – he said, ‘You can have it, and you
need not pay anything to me because I don’t think that I can ever find a
purchaser for it; that’s why I have thrown it away. You can take it! It
is yours just for the asking.’</p><p>Michaelangelo took away the rock. After a few months he invited the
shop-owner to see what had happened to the rock. The shopkeeper could
not believe his eyes. A beautiful jesus, a tremendously beautiful jesus
had come out... a very alive jesus. You could almost touch him and feel
him. There was a feeling that he was breathing and that he was looking
at you.</p><p>The shopkeeper said,‘What have you done? This is a miracle! And out
of that rotten rock!’ And Michaelangelo said,‘Now, at least, don’t say
that.’</p><p>‘But how could you do it?’ he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>Michaelangelo said,‘I have not done anything. When I was passing,
jesus called me. He said, “I have been encaged in this rock for many
many years – thousands of years – and only you can release me.” I have
simply helped him to come out, that’s all!’</p><p><br></p><p>Once you have an eye to see god, you will find him in every rock,
ready to be released. You can touch him and you will feel his breathing.
You can touch him and you will feel his warmth. You can touch him and
you will feel his response.</p><p><br></p><p>But that happens only when you really look for him, otherwise not.
When you put your total energy into looking, when your whole life energy
flows through your eyes... when the intensity is total – more you cannot
do – then he is there, visible. Ordinarily he is invisible.</p><p><br></p><p>I give you this name: deva agochara... god invisible. I give you this
name as a challenge. He has to be made gochara – he has to be made
visible. I give you this rock... you have to release god from it. And I
can see it.<span class=s4></span>Just a little effort, just a little
longing, just a little more thirst, and things will start</p><p>happening.</p><p><br></p><p>[The new sannyasin says that in the West he was doing painting.]</p><p><br></p><p>Very good. That’s the right thing to do! That’s very good. My feeling
is always for people who are creative, because to me only a creative
person can be religious. Non-creative persons cannot be religious.
Because god is the creator, and only by being, do you participate with
him, otherwise not. If your worship is non-creative it is not going to
help. If your prayer is non-creative it is not going to help.</p><p><br></p><p>You can go on doing all the rituals prescribed by all the religions
of the world, and they will be just impotent gestures unless you create
something – a poem, a painting, a sculpture<span class=s4></span>unless</p><p>you do something in the way god is creating. So you have to become
creative<span class=s4></span>of course on a</p><p>smaller scale. God has painted the whole world with tremendous colour
– it is not a grey world; it is psychedelic.</p><p><br></p><p>His creativity is infinite; he never repeats anything again. His
originality seems to be incredible. He has never recreated a single
thing again. He has never created a man like you before and he will
never create again. He creates only unique human beings<span class=s4></span>unique trees. You cannot find one tree</p><p>similar to another tree – impossible!</p><p><br></p><p>If you take one leaf of a tree, you cannot find a second leaf exactly
like it on the whole of the earth. Of course his infinitude, his
creativity, has no beginning, no end. But when a man becomes in his own
small measure, in his own small way, creative, he participates. He
throbs with god’s being.<span class=s4></span>he</p><p>breathes with him. He pulsates in those moments with his life: in
those moments he is not himself.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why creators always feel shy when they have to sign their
paintings or their poetry<span class=s4></span>very shy.</p><p>Only mediocres don’t feel shy. Creators always feel, ‘How to sign it?
I have been just an instrument. Something has happened through me, but I
have not done anything.’</p><p><br></p><p>Creativity is not your doing. It is as if you allow god to do
something through you.<span class=s4></span>it is a let-go. But</p><p>in those few moments one is prayerful.</p><p><br></p><p>And this has been a calamity on the earth – that up to now religions
have not been very creative. They attracted non-creative people; they
attracted negative people. They attracted, somehow, pathological people.
So religion up to now has been more or less pathological. It has not
been life-affirmative. It has not been ecstatic and not creative.</p><p><br></p><p>My whole effort here is to bring a totally new religion into the
world – a religion of creativity... a religion which can sing and
dance... a religion which can love.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

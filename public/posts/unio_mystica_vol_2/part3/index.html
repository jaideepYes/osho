THE COMING OF DEATH\nIS THE KEY WHICH UNLOCKS THE UNKNOWN DOMAIN;\nBUT FOR DEATH, THE DOOR OF TRUE FAITH WOULD REMAIN UNOPENED.\nIF YOU YOURSELF\nARE UPSIDE DOWN IN REALITY, THEN YOUR WISDOM AND FAITH ARE BOUND TO BE TOPSY-TURVY.\nSTOP WEAVING A NET ABOUT YOURSELF:\nBURST LIKE A LION FROM THE CAGE. MELT YOURSELF DOWN IN THIS SEARCH:\nVENTURE YOUR LIFE AND YOUR SOUL IN THE PATH OF SINCERITY;\nSTRIVE TO PASS FROM NOTHINGNESS TO BEING,\nAND MAKE YOURSELF DRUNK WITH THE WINE OF GOD.\nMind is the original fall – the fall from the state of being. Mind is the original sin. To be in the mind is to be in the world: not to be in the mind is to be in God.\nThis much is the difference – but a difference that makes a difference.\nThe fall has to be understood. Meditate over three words: being, doing, having. From being to having is the fall, and doing is the process of coming from being to having. Being is God, having is the world, doing is the process of falling from being to having.\nHence, the mind is a doer. The mind constantly wants to be occupied. A great hankering to remain busy; that is the mind. One cannot sit alone; one cannot sit in passive receptivity, not even for a few moments. It is such a torture for the mind, because the moment you stop doing, the mind starts disappearing.\nIf you go to a Zen master and ask, “What do you do here? What are these people, your followers, doing?” he will say, “They just sit. They don’t do a thing.”\nIt happened:\nA king came to visit the monastery of a Zen master. The master took him around; he was very interested in knowing everything about the monastery. He took the king to every place except one – the central temple. And that was the most imposing building, and yet whenever the king asked, “Why don’t you take me to the temple?” the master would behave as if he had not heard.\nFinally, the king was very angry, because he was even taken to bathrooms and toilets. He said, “Are you mad or something? Why don’t you take me to the temple?”\nAnd the master said, “For a certain reason – because you are constantly asking, ‘What do you do here?’ In the library we read: I can take you to the library. In the bathrooms we take baths: I can take you to the bathrooms. In the kitchen we prepare food. But to that temple I cannot take you because we don’t do a thing there! That is the place where we move into non-doing, into non-action. And it will be impossible to explain that to you – that’s why. You are a great king, you are a great doer, and you are so much engrossed with having more and more. You understand the way of the mind, but you will not understand the ways which are not of the mind.”\nThe mind is a doer. Watch your own mind and you will understand. What I am saying is not a philosophical statement, it is just a fact. I am not proposing any theory for you to believe or to disbelieve, but something that you can watch in your own being. And you will see it – whenever you are alone, you immediately start looking: something has to be done, you have to go somewhere, you have to see somebody. You can’t be alone. You can’t be a non-doer.\nDoing is the process by which the mind is created; it is condensed doing. hence, meditation means a state of non-doing. If you can sit silently doing nothing, suddenly you are back home. Suddenly you see your original face, suddenly you see the source. And that source is satchitanand: it is truth, it is consciousness, it is bliss – call it God, or nirvana, or what you will.\nFrom being to doing to having – this is how Adam-consciousness arrives in the world. To move backwards, from having to doing, from doing to being – this is what Christ-consciousness means. But Sufis have a very tremendously significant message for the world. They say the perfect man is one who is capable of moving from being to doing to having to doing to being, and so on, so forth. When the circle is perfect then the man is perfect.\nOne should be capable of doing. I am not saying that you should become incapable of doing; that will not be of any value, that will be simply impotence. You should be capable of doing, but you should not be engrossed in it. You should not become involved in it, you should not become possessed by it, you should remain the master.\nAnd I am not saying that all that you have has to be dropped, I am not saying to renounce all that you have. Use it, but don’t be used by it, that’s all. Then the perfect man is born.\nI call that perfect man a sannyasin: he will be both Adam plus Christ. The worldly man is Adam, and up to now the otherworldly man has been involved with Christ-consciousness. But both are half-half.\nMan needs to become a totality, a wholeness. And my definition of being holy is nothing but to be whole – capacity to come into the world and yet remain above it, beyond it; capacity to use the mind but yet remain centered in your being. Then the mind is a mechanism of immense value; then it is not a sin to have a beautiful mind. You have a beautiful instrument of immense complexity, and it is a joy to use it, just as it is a joy to drive a beautiful car which is a perfect mechanism.\nThere is nothing like the mind, if you can use it; then the mind is divine too. But if you are used by it, and your sky gets lost in the clouds of the mind, then you’ll remain in misery, in ignorance.\nThe arrival of the mind happens through getting identified with the contents of consciousness. Just a small change, a single step is needed, and that step bridges this to that. That single step bridges the world to God, the outer to the inner, the mundane to the sacred. What is that single step? Non-identification.\nRemain a witness. Always remember to remain a witness: whatsoever passes in the mind, know perfectly well you are not it. You are not the stuff called the mind. Once you become identified with any stuff of the mind, you are trapped in a prison. Then you can go on changing and re-arranging the stuff again and again, but nothing will happen.\nThat’s what people go on doing – improving upon themselves, creating a beautiful character, becoming saintly, religious, but the basic thing has not yet been done. They are simply rearranging the stuff of the mind.\nYou can go on arranging the furniture of your house; you can arrange it in better ways, far more aesthetically, but it remains the same stuff. The sinner and the so-called saint are not very different; both are different arrangements of the same mind.\nThe real sage is one who has become aware that he is not the mind at all. The idea of sin arises in him, and he remains aloof; and the idea of being a saint arises in him, and he remains aloof. He gets identified with nothing – anger or compassion, hate or love, good or bad. He remains non- judgmental, he does not condemn anything in the mind. If you are just a witness, what is the point of condemning anything? And he does not praise anything in the mind – if you are just a witness, again, praise is just futile. He remains cool and collected and centered. The mind goes on raving around him, just from past momentum.\nFor thousands of lives you have remained identified with the mind, you have poured so much energy into it. It goes on revolving and revolving for a few months, even for a few years. But if you can\nremain a silent watcher, a watcher on the hills, then slowly slowly the energy, the momentum, is lost and the mind comes to a stop.\nThe day the mind stops, you have arrived. The first vision of what God is and what you are happens immediately – because once the mind stops, your whole energy that has remained involved with it is released. And that energy is tremendous, it is infinite: it starts falling on you. It is a great benediction, it is grace.\nThe so-called revolutionaries go on failing because they go on re-arranging the same stuff of the mind. Somebody believes in God, and then comes a revolutionary who says, “There is no God and I don’t believe in any God.” But he is as much a fanatic about his idea as the people who believe in God.\nBelievers and disbelievers, both are fanatics. One has become attached to the yes, the other has become attached to the no, but yes or no both are part of the mind. You have chosen one part, somebody else has chosen another part. One is a Christian, another is a Hindu, but both are minds. One has chosen the Bible, the other has chosen the Vedas, but both are part of the mind.\nThen who is really religious? One who has not chosen out of the mind at all. You cannot call him Christian, you cannot call him Hindu, you cannot call him communist, you cannot call him theist or atheist. He simply is: indefinable he is. You cannot label him. Being is so vast that it cannot be labelled, no word is adequate enough to describe it. In that vastness is freedom, in that vastness is bliss.\nThis is real revolution: jumping from the mind to the being. And the process will remain the same. If doing is the process of falling from being to having, then non-doing will be the process of coming back home.\nMeditation is not something that you do: meditation is something that happens when you are not doing anything at all. You can sit apparently unmoving, apparently not doing anything, but deep down the mind can continue. That’s how it happens in the monasteries, how it happens in the caves. You may not have much to do, but you can go on doing just a few things again and again. You can go on repeating a mantra: that will do, it is enough for the mind. It will go on doing the same act again and again, playing the same tape again and again, for years, and it will not die.\nThree yogis are sitting in a cave meditating. A horse comes by, looks in, and goes. A few years pass and one of the yogis says, “A horse came in.”\nA few more years pass and another says, “No, it was a mare.”\nAfter a few more years the third says, “If there is going to be an argument, I am leaving.”\nNow, nothing has happened for so many years, a horse just came and looked in, but that is enough to keep you occupied for years. It is enough, the mind can live even on this much stuff. One has to be very aware that it is not a question of whether you are involved in many many works or you are just doing a few things; it is not a question of quantity. The question is of quality.\nYou may be very rich, you may be a king and have many possessions and have to remain involved in a thousand and one things, and then you may renounce the kingdom and all your possessions and become a beggar and live in a hut – this will not make any difference at all! To outsiders, to spectators, it will look like a great revolution has happened: the emperor has become a beggar, he has renounced so much. But nothing has happened inside.\nFirst you were involved with the affairs of the kingdom, now you will be involved with the affairs of the small hut. Just the quantity has been reduced, but by reducing the quantity, the quality of your consciousness never changes. The poor man is worried about his bullock-cart, and the rich man is worried about his golden chariot. But the worry is the same; worrying is the same quality. The poor man is worried about tomorrow’s food, and the king is worried about the neighboring country; the object of worry is different, but the process of worrying is the same.\nThe question is, how to change your focus from the mind to the being. Doing has brought you into the world, doing is the ladder that has brought you into the world; non-doing will be the ladder... And non-doing is not inactivity. That point has to be understood well, then you will be able to understand Hakim Sanai’s sutras of today.\nNon-doing is not inactivity, it is not inaction. Action is there, because action is life. If action completely disappears, you will be dead. Even to breathe is an action; to eat, to digest, to sleep – all are activities. To live is to be active. Then what is non-doing if it is not inactivity? If you understand non-doing as inactivity, you will have missed the whole point of it. Now inactivity will become your occupation. You will be constantly occupied with not doing this and not doing that. Your process will become negative, but it is still doing: “I can’t do this, I can’t do that.” Now you are worried. The same tensions will still be there: “I can’t eat this, I can’t eat that, I can’t wear this, I can’t wear that.” Now you are becoming negative – but the process, the ego, is still there; the mind is still there. It is standing upside down, it is doing a headstand, but it is the same mind.\nNon-doing is something which has nothing to do with action, but has much to do with the ego, with the idea of the ego. The doer is the ego: one has to become a non-doer. Then God is the doer. Then you are in a let-go. Then you don’t push the river, then you don’t create agony for yourself by pushing.\nLet me remind you of what I was telling you just the other day: agony comes from a root ‘ag’ – ag means pushing. The more you push the river, the more agony is created. And while you are pushing the river, you are certainly trying to swim upstream. You are going against nature, against Tao, against God.\nThe non-doer is one who has relaxed with the river, who is floating with the river, flowing with the river, one who has become part of the river, who does not think himself separate at all; one who has no individual destiny. That is the meaning of non-doing. Now the destiny of the total is his destiny. “Wherever the whole is going, I am also going – wherever, to whatsoever destination or no-destination. Wherever this beautiful existence is moving, I am part of it. I am a ripple in this great lake, just a small ripple. I need not have an individual destiny.”\nOut of individual destiny arises fear, anguish, agony. Out of individual destiny – that “I have to do something, I have to be somebody, I have to reach somewhere” – the mind is created. Doing means:\n“I have some idea how I should be, what I should be.” Non-doing means: “I drop all ideas of my being separate from existence.”\nNon-separation is non-doing. Action continues, but it is no more your action. Now it is natural. If a snake passes by on the footpath, you have gone for a morning walk and a snake passes by, you simply jump out of the way of the snake. It is not that you have done it – action has happened, but it is natural. You did not think about it, you didn’t ponder over it. You were not ready for it; you may not have come across a snake ever before in your life. You had not practised it, it is not a program in your mind. You responded. In the form of the snake, there was death. You responded – immediately, instantly. The mind never came in, because the mind needs time to ponder, to think, to contemplate. And there is no time, death is so close by: you simply jumped.\nSitting underneath a tree when the snake has passed, you may think about it; now you have enough time to think. But in that moment, in that momentous moment when the snake was facing you, you simply acted – not out of the mind but out of your totality. It was God’s act.\nThe man who really wants to become a non-doer starts acting as a vehicle of the divine, of the whole. Action continues, but the actor disappears. That is the meaning of non-doing. You live the same life, but now you have a totally different quality, a different flavor to it.\nThe sutras:\nIF YOU KNOW YOUR OWN WORTH, WHAT NEED YOU CARE ABOUT\nTHE ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION OF OTHERS?\nA very fundamental thing. Sanai says: IF YOU KNOW YOUR OWN WORTH you need not be worried what others think about you, whether they accept you or reject you. If you are worried about others’ rejection and acceptance, that simply shows one thing – that you don’t know your own worth, that you don’t know your own being, that you don’t know God resides in you, that you are an abode of the divine.\nHence you are worried what people are thinking about you – because on their thinking, on their opinion, will depend much. Your ego depends on others’ opinions: your being depends on nobody. That’s why the man of being is always a rebel, and the man who lives in the ego has to compromise very much with the society. The egoist has to compromise, because if he does not compromise, nobody is going to fulfill his ego. The ego needs others’ support, it needs props from others: the more people like you, the better and more polished and refined an ego you can have.\nThat’s why people read books like Dale Carnegie’s HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE, or Napoleon Hill, and others. There are thousands of these so-called philosophers who go on teaching people how to polish the ego in a better way, how to decorate it.\nThe modern mind is very much concerned about it, how you look to others. Why? Because we have lost all sense of our own being. Now all that we have is the ego, and the ego needs others’ support.\nIf you don’t fulfill their expectations about you, they will withdraw their support. and the more you fulfill their expectations, the more of a slave you become. Whatsoever they want you to do, you do. You are just obedient, constantly compromising. Whether you like it or not does not matter to you; the whole question is whether others like it. If they want you to smile, you smile. The smile may be phoney, but that is not the point – because people like it. And when they like your smile, they will love you. And when they love you, they will give attention to you, they will respect you. They will fulfill your need to be needed.\nThis is the whole process that we call our life. And if this life remains a constant frustration, it is not a wonder.\nIF YOU KNOW YOUR OWN WORTH, WHAT NEED YOU CARE ABOUT\nTHE ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION OF OTHERS?\nThe man who knows himself is completely unworried about what others say.\nWhen Jesus was carrying his cross, was he worried about what others were saying? They were all making him, or trying to make him, a laughing-stock. They were abusing him, they were making cutting jokes about him, they were throwing banana skins at him. They were ridiculing him in every possible way, in a very inhuman way. But was Jesus worried? Not at all, because they cannot take anything of his being. And what they can take, he has already renounced; he has dropped all that can be taken by others. Now he exists as a naked being, his own self, which not even death can take away. Fire cannot burn it, no sword can cut it. All that can be taken by others has already been dropped by him. Now people can laugh: he can watch. He can watch unperturbed undisturbed.\nWhen Mansoor was killed, he looked at the sky and laughed loudly. Thousands of people had gathered to ridicule him, to abuse him, to condemn him. They could not understand why he was laughing. The situation was such that if he had been crying it would have been okay, but why was he laughing? And somebody from the crowd asked, “Mansoor, why are you laughing?”\nHe said, “I am laughing because you think you are killing ME! You cannot kill me. And the one you are killing, I am not that. I am laughing at your foolishness. You are killing my body, it is like burning my garments – and I am standing there and laughing at the foolishness of it all. The one you can kill, I have renounced myself. Only that which is indestructible, only that which is immortal, have I saved. Now there is no fear: no thief can steal it and no murderer can kill it.\n“Hence, I am laughing. You people who have gathered here are all stupid – that’s why I am laughing.”\nBut th society, from the very beginning, starts taking your self-worth from you. The child – every child around the earth, in all the societies – is forced to renounce his being, is forced to accept others’ opinions about himself. Every child is born absolutely accepting himself as he is. He has no dislike for himself, he is utterly in love with himself. Each child is born with great love for himself; he has self-love, self-respect – because he is not yet a mind.\nBut the parents are afraid, the society is afraid: if he remains being-oriented he will never be a slave. And the society needs slaves, the society needs obedient people. The society does not need individuals, it needs phoney personalities. It needs people who are efficient, but not intelligent. It allows intelligence only to the extent that you remain efficient, but it does not allow your intelligence to grow to its maximum – because at the maximum, intelligence will be so rebellious, so revolutionary, it will be fire.\nAnd the society is so rotten, it cannot allow that much fire to people, that much freedom to people. It needs dead people, dull people, unintelligent people, so they can go on and on working for others’ interests – for the priest, for the politician, they go on working. It needs millions of slaves. It’s really a miracle that, once in a while, a Buddha, a Jesus, a Sanai, escapes from the clutches of the society and becomes independent.\nThe society, from the very beginning, teaches you, “Listen to what others say about you, because that is what you are.” Now this is so stupid, the whole idea. Others don’t know themselves, and they decide who I am. I don’t know about myself, who I am, and I decide about others, who they are. This is a mutual deception. I don’t know who I am, you don’t know who you are: you decide about me, I decide about you. Blind people deciding about each other. Blind people telling each other, “You are beautiful; your face is so beautiful, or so ugly.” Blind people deciding who is a sinner and who is a saint.\nAnd such great fear is created from the very beginning in every child that your whole life you are tortured by it. If somebody does not think well of you, you lose your whole night – you cannot sleep: somebody doesn’t think well of you. How does it matter? Who is he to decide about you? But the reason is that you have forgotten yourself; you don’t know who you are. You depend on him – if he doesn’t think well of you, then something is wrong with you; you start losing self-respect.\nWhen nobody respects you, how can you respect yourself? Your self-respect is just a cumulative effect of many people pouring their respect towards you. And these are the ignorant people, as ignorant as you are. They know nothing, but this is their way of manipulating each other. “I respect you, I am paying you, I am bribing you, to be manipulated by me. You respect me because you want to manipulate me.”\nThis is how it goes on. The man who knows his self-worth, the man who knows who he is, will remain absolutely unconcerned. And just see the point: when you are absolutely unconcerned with what people say about you, you have a freedom, a psychological freedom, you are out of the psychological slavery of the society. Your soul is born.\n“I am afraid I have developed a terrible habit,” the patient told his psychiatrist. “Wherever I am, I can’t help talking to myself. Is there anything you can do for me?”\n“I suppose there is,” the psychiatrist replied. “But I should warn you it will be a long, slow, painful treatment, and very expensive as well. But suppose you do talk to yourself – is that so bad?”\n“No, I guess it isn’t,” the patient agreed. “But I am such a bore!”\nNobody can live with himself, hence you need others. They cannot live alone themselves, hence they need you. They are boring, you are boring – and both are thinking that by being together the\nboredom will disappear? It will not only be doubled, it will be multiplied. Have you ever seen more bored people than couples?\nYou can see – if a couple is passing by on the road, you can know immediately whether they are husband and wife or not. If they are husband and wife, they both look so bored, utterly bored. If the man looks happy and the woman looks happy, then they are not husband and wife. She must be a wife to somebody else, and he must be a husband to somebody else.\nOnce I was traveling in a train; a woman was traveling with me, and her husband or friend was in another compartment. At every station, wherever the train stopped, he would come again. Sometimes he would bring ice cream, sometimes sweets, sometimes this and that.\nI asked the woman, “Who is this man?” She said, “He is my husband.”\nI said, “Don’t lie!”\nShe said, “How do you know?”\n“Husbands are not known to do such things – at every stop! Once the husband has escaped from the wife, then only at the last stop does he turn up if at all. You are fortunate: at each stop he comes bringing this and that!”\nShe said, “You are right. He is not my husband, he is just my boyfriend.” I asked her, “How long have you been together?”\nShe said, “Nearabout seven years.” I said, “Wrong again!”\nShe said, “How do you know this?”\n“Seven years is too long a time! Honeymoons are finished within fifteen days – and this whole thing seems to be like a honeymoon.”\nShe said, “You surprise me – we really are going on a honeymoon! I have known him only for seven or eight days.”\nEverybody is bored with himself. That’s why when Buddha says, “Sitting silently, I have arrived, and bliss has happened to me,” we listen to him but we don’t believe him. Or maybe he is just an exception – because when you sit silently, only boredom happens and nothing else.\nEverybody has tried sometimes to sit silently like a Buddha, but within minutes you are so fed up with yourself, because the mind goes on churning and churning, the inner talk continues, and it is boring. you know these things: you have been boring others, now you are boring yourself. You have\nheard these things said by your mind so many times, and it goes on and on with no stop. And all that happens when you are alone is you become aware of your mind. When you are with others you forget yourself: you become interested in the other, the other becomes interested in you. That is a kind of self-deception.\nAll meditation techniques say that unless you are capable of being alone, you will never be able to know your being. It will take a certain time for the mind t slow down. But if you can sit silently for a few hours every day, unoccupied, doing nothing – the mind will go mad in the beginning, will go very crazy, round and round it will run, but if you can go on patiently waiting and waiting and waiting – you will see that slowly slowly the momentum of the mind is disappearing. Thoughts are moving but not so fast – not running but limping, puzzled, looking at you: “What has happened to you?” They are not so powerful, as if their life has disappeared; not so self-confident, but shaky, looking at you, puzzled, wondering, “What are you doing?”\nIf you go on watching your thoughts for a certain time, one day the miracle happens: even if it happens for only a few moments, then you have looked into your being. In those few moments you have been with your being; the mind disappeared, there was not a single thought moving by. And once you have contacted your being, you will never be worried what others say. They can condemn you, they can think of you as a sinner or they can worship you, they can think of you as a saint – it is all the same. Success and failure are the same, fame or defame are the same. Whether anybody knows about you, or nobody knows about you, is the same.\nAnd just contemplate on that quality when nothing affects you: for the first time you are rooted, for the first time you are centered, integrated, for the first time the mind is not and you are.\nWORSHIP HIM AS IF YOU COULD SEE HIM WITH YOUR PHYSICAL EYES; THOUGH YOU DON’T SEE HIM,\nHE SEES YOU.\nAnd only when you have become completely indifferent to what people say about you will you be able to face God. Otherwise you remain facing people. When you have become utterly indifferent to what people say about you, you are capable of turning God-wards. Otherwise your eyes and your ears and your senses are all focused on others; they are outgoing, they are not ingoing.\nOnce you have become capable of dropping people and what they say about you, your energy is available to move God-wards. WORSHIP HIM... now let your energy become worship. And by ‘worship’ is meant wonder, awe, love. By ‘worship’ is not meant any formal worship: going to a temple and worshipping a statue – that is not meant. Worship is a new vision, a new insight into reality.\nWhen the child looks at the sun rising, look into his eyes: that is worship – he is so mystified, in such awe. When the child looks at the starry night, look into his eyes: those stars reflected in his eyes, that is worship.\nThe child knows what worship is. We have forgotten, because we have forgotten the language of wonder. We have become too knowledgeable: when the sun rises, we know what it is. Nobody really knows, but we have been to school, to college, to university, so we have become knowledgeable. When a flower blooms, we know what the name of the flower is, what species it belongs to, and from what country it comes. But all these things are meaningless, irrelevant.\nSomething wonderful is happening: the flower has opened, the fragrance is released. The flower is utterly beautiful, alive, and you simply label it. You say, “This is a rose” – and you think you have known it just by giving it a name? You have missed. You have de-mystified the flower, and hence you have missed the wonder of it. Otherwise, each flower will give a thrill to your heart, each star will give it a new beat and each bird will start singing within you.\nLife is so psychedelic, it is such a splendor. To feel the wonder of it, to feel the awe, is worship. And then in some unknown moment you may bow down to existence. You may kneel down on the earth, or you may fall on the sand, in great prayer, in great love, as if the earth is your mother – it is: the existence is your mother – and great love will upsurge in you. That upsurging love is worship.\nWORSHIP HIM AS IF YOU COULD SEE HIM WITH YOUR PHYSICAL EYES; THOUGH YOU DON’T SEE HIM,\nHE SEES YOU.\nWhenever you are in a worshipful moment, you will be surprised: the whole existence is watching you, the whole existence is looking at you, is caressing you, is caring about you. You will feel some invisible hands caressing you, some invisible eyes looking at you, some invisible energy embracing you.\nWHILST IN THIS LAND\nOF FRUITLESS PURSUITS,\nYOU ARE ALWAYS UNBALANCED, ALWAYS EITHER ALL BACK OR ALL FRONT;\nBUT ONCE THE SEEKING SOUL HAS PROGRESSED JUST A FEW PACES BEYOND THIS STATE,\nLOVE SEIZES THE REINS.\nIf you allow worship to happen, love soon arrives – and a love that you have not even dreamt about. The love that you know is not real love, because there is no feeling of mystery in it, no awe, no worship, no prayer, in it.\nIf you really love a woman, you will love her as a goddess. If you really love a man, you will love him as a god. There is no other way to love. Love transforms everything into the divine; that is love’s chemistry. If love does not do that, then it must be something else. It may be lust, it may be sexual desire. It may be just a need – physical, psychological.\nLove is not a need! Love is an overflowing of joy. It happens only to worshippers, to prayerful people. Otherwise, you remain in this futile world – THIS LAND OF FRUITLESS PURSUITS. From your childhood to your old age, what do you go on doing? Playing with toys.\nThe little boy was sitting on the curb, crying, and an old man who was passing by came over to him. “What’s the matter, little boy?” he asked. “Why are you crying?”\nThe little boy said, “I’m crying because I can’t do what big boys do.” The old man sat down on the curb and cried too.\nThere is not much difference: children are childish, but your so-called old people are just as childish as children, sometimes even more so. Maturity is very rare; people remain immature. If you are interested only in toys – possessing this, possessing that, becoming famous, reaching some political power, prestige, having money, becoming very famous in the world – if you are interested in these things, you remain part of this stupid world of futile fruitless pursuits. But those pursuits keep you engages, they keep you occupied. They are intoxicants.\nAnd the most surprising thing is that from this fruitless futile world, the world of fruitfulness is not far away. It is very close by, just around the corner.\nJim and Joe were two friends who shared an apartment together in Chicago. One day, Jim came home to find Joe weeping into his hands. “I am so unlucky! So unlucky!” he moaned.\n“You are always saying that, and it is not so,” Jim said.\n“It is! It is!” Joe said. “I’m the most unlucky fellow you know!” “What happened now?”\n“Well, I met this beautiful woman on Madison Street. We go to talking and we stopped off at a small bar and had a few drinks. Wow! We got really mellow. When she suggested that I should go to her place, I thought my luck had changed.”\n“It sounds like it did,” Jim said.\n“Minutes after we entered her apartment I was in bed with her. I was just starting to climax when we heard the door bang open.”\n“It’s my husband!” she said.\n“I didn’t even have time to grab a towel. I bounded for the window and just managed to climb out, hanging on the ledge by my hands, when he barged in.\n“He sized up the scene immediately, and then he saw my hands hanging on for dear life. He came to the window and started pounding my knuckles with a hammer. Then he pissed all over me. Then he slammed the window on my bloody fingers.\n“Then, as if I did not have enough trouble, two old ladies on the street saw me hanging there stark naked and they started screaming for the police. The cops came and I was arrested. Now do you see what I mean when I say I am unlucky?”\n“Nonsense,” Jim said, “You are upset, but an experience like that could happen to anyone.”\n“You don’t understand,” Joe said. “When the cops came to arrest me, I looked down and my feet were only four inches from the ground. Now do you see what I mean when I say I’m unlucky?”\nThe other world is not far away! It is just around the corner – not even a distance of four inches. Just a little change of your focus, of your consciousness, of your awareness, and you move from this to that. And it can happen any moment. All that is needed is the understanding that whatsoever you have been doing up to now, and you are doing now, is futile. Let this sink into your heart as deeply as possible, that whatsoever you are doing is futile.\nMoney is not going to help, fame is not going to help, power is not going to help. Death will come and all will be snatched away from you. And what does it matter how much money you have got? The only real thing in the world is how much being you have got.\nHaving is the fallen state: being is Christ risen, resurrected. WHILE THIS WORLD REMAINS,\nTHAT ONE CANNOT BE; WHILST YOU EXIST,\nGOD CANNOT BE YOURS.\nYou can have only one world: this or that. Either you can have the world of dreams, then you cannot have the world with open eyes, the world of waking. If you have the world of waking, you cannot have the world of dreams. And people have chosen the world of dreams.\nWhy have people chosen the world of dreams? For one reason only: they have been forced to forget their reality. And when you do not know your reality, you have to create something to cling to, you have to create a substitute. Nothing is not acceptable: then anything is better than nothing, then even a dream is better than nothing. Then even remaining occupied in futile things is okay – at least one is occupied, one is not wasting one’s time; at least one is doing something, at least one is searching, at least one need not sit and cry for one’s fallen state.\nAt least it keeps you intoxicated: it keeps you hoping – “It has not happened today, but tomorrow it is going to happen.” It goes on creating tomorrows. And you know it has not happened yesterday, and it has not happened today. Yesterday also you were thinking it would happen tomorrow, today also you are thinking it will happen tomorrow, and tomorrow also you will go on thinking and postponing.\nIt keeps you, in a certain way, sane. Otherwise nothing is happening – and that will drive you insane.\nZen masters, Sufi masters, Hassid masters, all the great masters of the world say one thing, that a disciple should not try sitting silently without a master. Why? Because if a disciple tries sitting silently without a master, soon he will start going crazy. The world of dreams will start disappearing. That was his world, the only world he had ever known – it will start disappearing into the far faraway distance like clouds dispersing. And the other world has not come yet; it will come only when the world of dreams has completely gone away, totally gone away. Even if a slight thin layer of dreams is there, it is not possible to see the real.\nYou can have either the dreams or the reality; when all the dreams are gone, the reality will happen. But that will take time. When ninety percent of the dreams are gone, still you have not known the reality. When ninety-nine percent of the dreams are gone, still you have not known the reality. And now you will start becoming very shaky: all that you had is disappearing down the drain, and nothing else has happened.\nThe mind will say, “Rush and catch hold of the disappearing dreams.” Nothingness frightens, nothingness looks like death. You will need somebody to give you the feeling that “Don’t be worried, it is perfectly all right, this is how it happens. This is how it happened to me too. Just a little more – wait a little more, have a little more patience: that one percent of the dream will also disappear.” And it is very scary. The space is maddening.\nThe master is needed to keep you patient, the master is needed to help you not to become too frightened. The fear is natural: you are falling into an abyss, you are disappearing – because with your possessions your ego will disappear, with your doings your ego will disappear. And, slowly slowly, you will find a nothingness: you were looking for God, you were looking for truth. You were looking for something immortal, deathless – and instead of deathlessness happening, death is happening. There is every possibility that if you are alone, you will rush away. A master is needed.\nAnd all the great masters have created Buddhafields. If a field can be created, it is even more helpful. When there are millions of people meditating, a great field is created. You are not alone: there are people ahead of you, there are people behind you. The people who are ahead are telling you, “Yes, this happens, but it disappears.” And you can tell people who are behind you, “Yes, this happens, what is happening to you, but it disappears.” You are in a chain.\nThat’s why communes have been created, down the ages. Around each great master a commune arises – it has to arise. It creates a certain energy-field: in that energy-field, people can grow more easily. It becomes the Garden.\nHakim Sanai has called this book THE WALLED GARDEN OF TRUTH: the HADIQA.\nWhen there are thousands of trees blooming, new seeds can take courage and jump into the soil and die, because they know it happens. So many trees are saying, so many flowers are declaring, “Don’t be worried. Disappear into the soil and you will resurrect. This happened to us.”\nWHILE THIS WORLD REMAINS, THAT ONE CANNOT BE; WHILST YOU EXIST,\nGOD CANNOT BE YOURS.\nYou have to disappear like a seed into the soil. That disappearance looks like death – it is not. Only apparently do you die: in fact you are born for the first time. It is resurrection, it is rebirth, you become twice-born. And for the first time you know something of the immortal. You are carrying it in a seed form, and you can know it only when it becomes a flower, when it becomes a fragrance.\nThe seed is gross; the seed is only the potential. Unless it becomes actual, you will not be able to see it; it will remain hidden. And if you cut open a seed, you will not find it either. So if somebody goes to the surgeon and asks him, “Is there God in me?” the surgeon can cut him open and look inside, but he will not find any God anywhere. No X-ray machine is going to give you a picture of your soul.\nThat’s why science goes on saying there is no God, no soul – they are simply dissecting the seed. The seed has not to be dissected; the seed has to fall into the soil and disappear there in the darkness of the soil, in the womb of the earth. It has to disappear there.\nThe master is a womb, the commune is a greater womb: the disciple comes and disappears into the womb. And then one day when the season is ripe, when the spring has come, something sprouts – something that you could never have imagined in the seed. Those two green leaves... and the tree has started growing.\nTHE COMING OF DEATH\nIS THE KEY WHICH UNLOCKS THE UNKNOWN DOMAIN;\nBUT FOR DEATH, THE DOOR OF TRUE FAITH WOULD REMAIN UNOPENED.\nSo don’t be afraid of this death that the seed has to face. Every disciple has to face it. THE COMING OF DEATH...\nSo when death starts coming to you, don’t be afraid. It is the beginning of a new life, of life abundant. That is the meaning of the story that Jesus is crucified, and after three days he is resurrected. This is not a historical fact. If you try to make it history you destroy its beauty, you destroy its poetry, you destroy its grandeur. You bring it into the world of facts. It is not a fact, it is an eternal myth. It happened before Jesus; it has happened to every master, it has to happen to every disciple. It is an eternal truth: the story simply depicts it, describes it. But don’t reduce it to historical fact.\nChristians go on destroying the beautiful story of Jesus’ life; they try to make it historical. If this resurrection of Jesus is historical, you have brought it into time, into the ordinary world of facts where Adolf Hitlers and Mussolinis exists. You have brought it into the ugly world of history, of time, of events. It is not an event, it never happened – although it always happens.\nIt is the essential truth of every seeker’s life. Every seeker has to die on the cross, and after three days – those three days are of waiting, symbolically of waiting – the spring can come and the resurrection.\nTHE COMING OF DEATH\nIS THE KEY WHICH UNLOCKS THE UNKNOWN DOMAIN...\nOnly by dying does the seed unlock the door and the tree starts growing. Only by dying as Adam do you unlock the door of Christ-consciousness in you. Only by dying as a mind do you unlock the door of being.\nTHE COMING OF DEATH\nIS THE KEY WHICH UNLOCKS THE UNKNOWN DOMAIN;\nBUT FOR DEATH, THE DOOR OF TRUE FAITH WOULD REMAIN UNOPENED.\nSo death is also beautiful. And remember, we are not talking of physical death at all: we are talking of psychological death. We are talking of the death of the ego, of egoing.\nIF YOU YOURSELF\nARE UPSIDE DOWN IN REALITY, THEN YOUR WISDOM AND FAITH ARE BOUND TO BE TOPSY-TURVY.\nAnd this is how we are. Being has been forgotten – which we are. And we have become identified with the mind – which we are not. This is the topsy-turvy state: the real is forgotten, and the unreal is pretending to be the real.\nIn this state you cannot know that which is. God surrounds you, truth surrounds you, but you cannot know God, you cannot know truth, because you are standing upside down. First you have to become true. To know truth, you have to become truth: you have to reach back to the source, you have to search and grope.\nYou are lost in the world of having. You have come into the world of having by the staircase of doing – now move backwards. When you move backwards on the same ladder, it is non-doing, because doing is less and less and less and then it disappears. And the first taste of being is the beginning of a totally new life – the life of eternity.\nSo there were these two blacks from a southern town, and they wanted women desperately but couldn’t find any. They were driving along the country road when they spotted a pig. One of the jumped out, scooped up the pig and stuck it on the seat between them.\nThey continued to chug along in their 1969 Ford when a police siren suddenly sounded behind them. A glance at the rear-view mirror showed them that a police car was in hot pursuit. They pulled over to the side. Not wanting to be caught with a stolen pig, they tossed a blanket over it.\nThe officer came up to the side of their car. “What are you up to?” he asked. “We were just out looking for women,” one of the lads replied truthfully.\nSuddenly the pig sticks its face through the folds of the blanket.\nThe cop stared, shook his head sadly, and said, “Lady, can you tell me what a nice southern girl like you is doing with these two blacks?”\nMan is in such an unconscious state! Man is almost drunk. He cannot see what is; he goes on believing what others say. He does not respect his own eyes, his own ears; he does not respect his own sensibilities. He has become very insensitive.\nYou go on believing what others say. Somebody says, “This is the house of God. This is the temple, or the synagogue, or the church,” and you start believing them, and you go and start worshipping a stone.\nAnd this foolishness, this utter stupidity, is thought to be religious. Religion belongs only to intelligence; religion is the flowering of intelligence. Just think about it again: what have you been doing in the name of religion? Repeating, imitating – what others have said, you have believed it. When you are going to look for yourself? When are you going to think for yourself?\nOnly by thinking for yourself, only by looking into things for your own self, will you be able, slowly slowly, to awaken. Otherwise this dream is going to continue. It has continued for long, it can continue for eternity – unless you take hold of your own being, unless you start working on your intelligence, unless you start sharpening your own intelligence. Nobody will help, remember. And if you can find somebody to help, then that is your master.\nPeople will help you to remain mediocre, because that is how they can go on exploiting you. If you can find somebody who is ready to help you to sharpen your intelligence, then be with that person: you have found a friend. It is very difficult to find a friend in this world, this world is very unfriendly. Everybody is interested in his own exploiting – and people who want to exploit you cannot want you to become intelligent.\nMy effort here is to sharpen your intelligence as much as possible. The whole process of this commune is that of sharpening your intelligence, so that you can stand on your own feet.\nDon’t go on repeating things like parrots, otherwise you will never become a man.\nMrs. Keller had a very talented parrot. At her dinner parties he was the center of attention, for she had trained him to repeat what the butler said when he announced the guests as they arrived.\nThe parrot had only one failing: he loved to make love to chickens. Every chance he got, he would fly over the fence into the yard of the farmer next door and make love to his chickens.\nThe farmer complained to Mrs. Keller, and finally she laid the law down to the parrot. “Bertram,” she said, “you better listen to me! The next time you go into Farmer Whalen’s yard I’m going to punish you plenty!”\nThe parrot hung his head to show he understood. But two days later, he couldn’t resist temptation and over the fence he went. He was deep into lovemaking with the third hen when Farmer Whalen spotted him and chased him. Whalen complained again to Mrs. Keller.\n“Now you’re going to get it,” she said. She got a pair of barber’s shears and clipped all the feathers from the top of the parrot’s head.\nThat night, Mrs. Keller threw one of her gala parties. She put the parrot on top of the piano.\n“Bertram,” she said, “you’ve been a rotten old thing. Tonight you’re to sit here all night. No wandering around and no playing the way you usually do!”\nAnd so, feeling rather disconsolate, the parrot sat on the piano. As the butler announced the guests, Bertram performed as usual, repeating the names. The butler said, “Mr. Arnold Levy and Lady Stella,” and the parrot said, “Mr. Arnold Levy and Lady Stella.” The butler said, “Mr. and Mrs. Robert Salomon,” and the parrot said, “Mr. and Mrs. Robert Salomon.”\nThen two bald-headed men entered the room. Without waiting for the butler to announce them, the parrot shouted, “All right, so you’ve also been caught making love to chickens? Ha, ha! Up here on the piano with me!”\nRemember, you are not a parrot, you are a man. Respect your manhood, respect the intelligence that has been given to you. Respect the gift of God and sharpen it, grow into it, let it come to an optimum.\nPeople use only five percent of their potential – that’s what psychologists have come to know. Even people who are thought to be very talented don’t use more than ten percent, and the people who are known as geniuses use only fifteen percent of their intelligence. Can you imagine what we have been missing? Can you imagine? If people use a hundred percent of their intelligence, this earth will become unique, this earth will be a paradise. There will be no need to think of a paradise after death, the paradise will be herenow.\nIt is possible – God has given you the potential. But the politicians and the priests have not allowed you to use it, and your so-called priests are all against it.\nIf you can find a man who helps you to sharpen your intelligence, who respects your intelligence, who wants you to grow it to the maximum so you can become aflame with intelligence, then you have found the master.\nThat is the only requirement that has to be fulfilled by a real master. And that is the only criterion by which you can understand whether you have come to a real master or not. And it is so simple, it is so obvious, when you come across a person who helps you to sharpen your consciousness, who helps you to go beyond the mediocrity that society has imposed upon you.\nDrop your mediocre selves. Inside you is a source of great intelligence, of divine intelligence. STOP WEAVING A NET ABOUT YOURSELF:\nBURST LIKE A LION FROM THE CAGE.\nThis is how a real master gives his message. Sanai says:\nSTOP WEAVING A NET ABOUT YOURSELF...\nStop weaving the nets of thoughts, desires, ambitions, imaginations. STOP WEAVING A NET ABOUT YOURSELF:\nBURST LIKE A LION FROM THE CAGE.\nThe cage in which you have been put by the society. Burst forth! Give a lion’s roar! And come out of the dreams into which you have fallen, in which you are trapped. Become rebellious, be revolutionaries.\nMELT YOURSELF DOWN IN THIS SEARCH:\nVENTURE YOUR LIFE AND YOUR SOUL IN THE PATH OF SINCERITY...\nOnly one thing has to be remembered: be authentic, be sincere to yourself. Declare your truth, whatsoever the cost. Even if life is risked, risk it, because truth is far more valuable than anything, because truth is true life. Risk all – be authentic! Whatsoever you are, stick to it! Don’t allow anybody to manipulate you, don’t allow anybody to enslave you. And MELT YOURSELF DOWN IN THIS SEARCH – and let the ego melt.\nYou have become frozen ice cubes: let these ice cubes melt. And once they have melted, they start flowing, they become alive and dynamic.\nMELT YOURSELF DOWN IN THIS SEARCH:\nVENTURE YOUR LIFE AND YOUR SOUL IN THE PATH OF SINCERITY;\nSTRIVE TO PASS FROM NOTHINGNESS TO BEING,\nAND MAKE YOURSELF DRUNK WITH THE WINE OF GOD.\nYou have been drinking many kinds of wines of this world – of money, power, fame: they are all poisons. But there is a wine – the wine of God, the wine of love, the wine of meditativeness, the wine that pours from the beyond into your heart. Become available to it.\nAnd how does one become available to it? Be open. And only an authentic person can be an open person. The person who is not authentic, who is not true to himself, who is pretending to be somebody he is not, cannot be open. He is a lie: he has to hide the lie in many ways.\nOnly a truthful person can be open – he has nothing to hide, he has nothing to protect. His whole periphery, his whole circumference, is open to existence; three hundred and sixty degrees of circumference are open to existence. He contacts existence from every direction, from all directions. He is available to reality, totally available.\nPeople who live as lies cannot be totally available; they are always afraid they may be caught lying. They have to protect themselves, they have to create an armour around themselves. They are open only in small ways – maybe just a keyhole from where they look into the world, and through which the world enters into them. But it can’t be much of a world. Through a keyhole the sun cannot enter much, and the winds cannot come in, and the rains cannot come in. And behind the keyhole you are hiding yourself and looking through the keyhole – whatsoever you perceive is going to be very partial. And everybody claims his partial vision as the truth.\nBursts forth from this cage. And that is possible only if you respect yourself, if you feel the dignity of being here, if you feel that God has created you as a unique being. He has never created anybody like you, and he will never create anybody like you again. You are unique, you are incomparable. Feel this gift, this grace, and respect yourself.\nThe man who respects himself is authentic. He cannot compromise: he would prefer to die but stick to his truth. And that is the price God asks for. Risk all that you have – because you don’t have anything, you only think you have. In reality, you are a nothingness.\nSanai says:\nSTRIVE TO PASS FROM NOTHINGNESS TO BEING,\nAND MAKE YOURSELF DRUNK WITH THE WINE OF GOD.\nBe open, and God starts pouring into you like wine from every nook and corner of existence. Then wherever you look, you find God. Then whatsoever you touch, you find God. Then whatsoever you drink and eat, you find God. And when God pours from everywhere, then life is a celebration.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"10126","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/unio_mystica_vol_2/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/unio_mystica_vol_2/>Unio Mystica, Vol 2</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">3 The Death of the Seed</h1><div class=post-meta>48 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;10126 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Unio_Mystica_Vol_2/part3.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

SEARCH:</p><p>VENTURE YOUR LIFE AND YOUR SOUL IN THE PATH OF SINCERITY;</p><p>STRIVE TO PASS FROM NOTHINGNESS TO BEING,</p><p><br></p><p>AND MAKE YOURSELF DRUNK WITH THE WINE OF GOD.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is the original fall – the fall from the state of being. Mind is
the original sin. To be in the mind is to be in the world: not to be in
the mind is to be in God.</p><p><br></p><p>This much is the difference – but a difference that makes a
difference.</p><p>The fall has to be understood. Meditate over three words: being,
doing, having. From being to having is the fall, and doing is the
process of coming from being to having. Being is God, having is the
world, doing is the process of falling from being to having.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, the mind is a doer. The mind constantly wants to be occupied.
A great hankering to remain busy; that is the mind. One cannot sit
alone; one cannot sit in passive receptivity, not even for a few
moments. It is such a torture for the mind, because the moment you stop
doing, the mind starts disappearing.</p><p><br></p><p>If you go to a Zen master and ask, “What do you do here? What are
these people, your followers, doing?” he will say, “They just sit. They
don’t do a thing.”</p><p><br></p><p>It happened:</p><p><br></p><p>A king came to visit the monastery of a Zen master. The master took
him around; he was very interested in knowing everything about the
monastery. He took the king to every place except one – the central
temple. And that was the most imposing building, and yet whenever the
king asked, “Why don’t you take me to the temple?” the master would
behave as if he had not heard.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, the king was very angry, because he was even taken to
bathrooms and toilets. He said, “Are you mad or something? Why don’t you
take me to the temple?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the master said, “For a certain reason – because you are
constantly asking, ‘What do you do here?’ In the library we read: I can
take you to the library. In the bathrooms we take baths: I can take you
to the bathrooms. In the kitchen we prepare food. But to that temple I
cannot take you because we don’t do a thing there! That is the place
where we move into non-doing, into non-action. And it will be impossible
to explain that to you – that’s why. You are a great king, you are a
great doer, and you are so much engrossed with having more and more. You
understand the way of the mind, but you will not understand the ways
which are not of the mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>The mind is a doer. Watch your own mind and you will understand. What
I am saying is not a philosophical statement, it is just a fact. I am
not proposing any theory for you to believe or to disbelieve, but
something that you can watch in your own being. And you will see it –
whenever you are alone, you immediately start looking: something has to
be done, you have to go somewhere, you have to see somebody. You can’t
be alone. You can’t be a non-doer.</p><p><br></p><p>Doing is the process by which the mind is created; it is condensed
doing. hence, meditation means a state of non-doing. If you can sit
silently doing nothing, suddenly you are back home. Suddenly you see
your original face, suddenly you see the source. And that source is
satchitanand: it is truth, it is consciousness, it is bliss – call it
God, or nirvana, or what you will.</p><p><br></p><p>From being to doing to having – this is how Adam-consciousness
arrives in the world. To move backwards, from having to doing, from
doing to being – this is what Christ-consciousness means. But Sufis have
a very tremendously significant message for the world. They say the
perfect man is one who is capable of moving from being to doing to
having to doing to being, and so on, so forth. When the circle is
perfect then the man is perfect.</p><p>One should be capable of doing. I am not saying that you should
become incapable of doing; that will not be of any value, that will be
simply impotence. You should be capable of doing, but you should not be
engrossed in it. You should not become involved in it, you should not
become possessed by it, you should remain the master.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am not saying that all that you have has to be dropped, I am
not saying to renounce all that you have. Use it, but don’t be used by
it, that’s all. Then the perfect man is born.</p><p><br></p><p>I call that perfect man a sannyasin: he will be both Adam plus
Christ. The worldly man is Adam, and up to now the otherworldly man has
been involved with Christ-consciousness. But both are half-half.</p><p><br></p><p>Man needs to become a totality, a wholeness. And my definition of
being holy is nothing but to be whole – capacity to come into the world
and yet remain above it, beyond it; capacity to use the mind but yet
remain centered in your being. Then the mind is a mechanism of immense
value; then it is not a sin to have a beautiful mind. You have a
beautiful instrument of immense complexity, and it is a joy to use it,
just as it is a joy to drive a beautiful car which is a perfect
mechanism.</p><p><br></p><p>There is nothing like the mind, if you can use it; then the mind is
divine too. But if you are used by it, and your sky gets lost in the
clouds of the mind, then you’ll remain in misery, in ignorance.</p><p><br></p><p>The arrival of the mind happens through getting identified with the
contents of consciousness. Just a small change, a single step is needed,
and that step bridges this to that. That single step bridges the world
to God, the outer to the inner, the mundane to the sacred. What is that
single step? Non-identification.</p><p><br></p><p>Remain a witness. Always remember to remain a witness: whatsoever
passes in the mind, know perfectly well you are not it. You are not the
stuff called the mind. Once you become identified with any stuff of the
mind, you are trapped in a prison. Then you can go on changing and
re-arranging the stuff again and again, but nothing will happen.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what people go on doing – improving upon themselves, creating
a beautiful character, becoming saintly, religious, but the basic thing
has not yet been done. They are simply rearranging the stuff of the
mind.</p><p><br></p><p>You can go on arranging the furniture of your house; you can arrange
it in better ways, far more aesthetically, but it remains the same
stuff. The sinner and the so-called saint are not very different; both
are different arrangements of the same mind.</p><p><br></p><p>The real sage is one who has become aware that he is not the mind at
all. The idea of sin arises in him, and he remains aloof; and the idea
of being a saint arises in him, and he remains aloof. He gets identified
with nothing – anger or compassion, hate or love, good or bad. He
remains non- judgmental, he does not condemn anything in the mind. If
you are just a witness, what is the point of condemning anything? And he
does not praise anything in the mind – if you are just a witness, again,
praise is just futile. He remains cool and collected and centered. The
mind goes on raving around him, just from past momentum.</p><p><br></p><p>For thousands of lives you have remained identified with the mind,
you have poured so much energy into it. It goes on revolving and
revolving for a few months, even for a few years. But if you can</p><p>remain a silent watcher, a watcher on the hills, then slowly slowly
the energy, the momentum, is lost and the mind comes to a stop.</p><p><br></p><p>The day the mind stops, you have arrived. The first vision of what
God is and what you are happens immediately – because once the mind
stops, your whole energy that has remained involved with it is released.
And that energy is tremendous, it is infinite: it starts falling on you.
It is a great benediction, it is grace.</p><p><br></p><p>The so-called revolutionaries go on failing because they go on
re-arranging the same stuff of the mind. Somebody believes in God, and
then comes a revolutionary who says, “There is no God and I don’t
believe in any God.” But he is as much a fanatic about his idea as the
people who believe in God.</p><p><br></p><p>Believers and disbelievers, both are fanatics. One has become
attached to the yes, the other has become attached to the no, but yes or
no both are part of the mind. You have chosen one part, somebody else
has chosen another part. One is a Christian, another is a Hindu, but
both are minds. One has chosen the Bible, the other has chosen the
Vedas, but both are part of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Then who is really religious? One who has not chosen out of the mind
at all. You cannot call him Christian, you cannot call him Hindu, you
cannot call him communist, you cannot call him theist or atheist. He
simply is: indefinable he is. You cannot label him. Being is so vast
that it cannot be labelled, no word is adequate enough to describe it.
In that vastness is freedom, in that vastness is bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>This is real revolution: jumping from the mind to the being. And the
process will remain the same. If doing is the process of falling from
being to having, then non-doing will be the process of coming back
home.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is not something that you do: meditation is something that
happens when you are not doing anything at all. You can sit apparently
unmoving, apparently not doing anything, but deep down the mind can
continue. That’s how it happens in the monasteries, how it happens in
the caves. You may not have much to do, but you can go on doing just a
few things again and again. You can go on repeating a mantra: that will
do, it is enough for the mind. It will go on doing the same act again
and again, playing the same tape again and again, for years, and it will
not die.</p><p><br></p><p>Three yogis are sitting in a cave meditating. A horse comes by, looks
in, and goes. A few years pass and one of the yogis says, “A horse came
in.”</p><p><br></p><p>A few more years pass and another says, “No, it was a mare.”</p><p><br></p><p>After a few more years the third says, “If there is going to be an
argument, I am leaving.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, nothing has happened for so many years, a horse just came and
looked in, but that is enough to keep you occupied for years. It is
enough, the mind can live even on this much stuff. One has to be very
aware that it is not a question of whether you are involved in many many
works or you are just doing a few things; it is not a question of
quantity. The question is of quality.</p><p>You may be very rich, you may be a king and have many possessions and
have to remain involved in a thousand and one things, and then you may
renounce the kingdom and all your possessions and become a beggar and
live in a hut – this will not make any difference at all! To outsiders,
to spectators, it will look like a great revolution has happened: the
emperor has become a beggar, he has renounced so much. But nothing has
happened inside.</p><p><br></p><p>First you were involved with the affairs of the kingdom, now you will
be involved with the affairs of the small hut. Just the quantity has
been reduced, but by reducing the quantity, the quality of your
consciousness never changes. The poor man is worried about his
bullock-cart, and the rich man is worried about his golden chariot. But
the worry is the same; worrying is the same quality. The poor man is
worried about tomorrow’s food, and the king is worried about the
neighboring country; the object of worry is different, but the process
of worrying is the same.</p><p><br></p><p>The question is, how to change your focus from the mind to the being.
Doing has brought you into the world, doing is the ladder that has
brought you into the world; non-doing will be the ladder... And
non-doing is not inactivity. That point has to be understood well, then
you will be able to understand Hakim Sanai’s sutras of today.</p><p><br></p><p>Non-doing is not inactivity, it is not inaction. Action is there,
because action is life. If action completely disappears, you will be
dead. Even to breathe is an action; to eat, to digest, to sleep – all
are activities. To live is to be active. Then what is non-doing if it is
not inactivity? If you understand non-doing as inactivity, you will have
missed the whole point of it. Now inactivity will become your
occupation. You will be constantly occupied with not doing this and not
doing that. Your process will become negative, but it is still doing: “I
can’t do this, I can’t do that.” Now you are worried. The same tensions
will still be there: “I can’t eat this, I can’t eat that, I can’t wear
this, I can’t wear that.” Now you are becoming negative – but the
process, the ego, is still there; the mind is still there. It is
standing upside down, it is doing a headstand, but it is the same
mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Non-doing is something which has nothing to do with action, but has
much to do with the ego, with the idea of the ego. The doer is the ego:
one has to become a non-doer. Then God is the doer. Then you are in a
let-go. Then you don’t push the river, then you don’t create agony for
yourself by pushing.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me remind you of what I was telling you just the other day: agony
comes from a root ‘ag’ – ag means pushing. The more you push the river,
the more agony is created. And while you are pushing the river, you are
certainly trying to swim upstream. You are going against nature, against
Tao, against God.</p><p><br></p><p>The non-doer is one who has relaxed with the river, who is floating
with the river, flowing with the river, one who has become part of the
river, who does not think himself separate at all; one who has no
individual destiny. That is the meaning of non-doing. Now the destiny of
the total is his destiny. “Wherever the whole is going, I am also going
– wherever, to whatsoever destination or no-destination. Wherever this
beautiful existence is moving, I am part of it. I am a ripple in this
great lake, just a small ripple. I need not have an individual
destiny.”</p><p><br></p><p>Out of individual destiny arises fear, anguish, agony. Out of
individual destiny – that “I have to do something, I have to be
somebody, I have to reach somewhere” – the mind is created. Doing
means:</p><p>“I have some idea how I should be, what I should be.” Non-doing
means: “I drop all ideas of my being separate from existence.”</p><p><br></p><p>Non-separation is non-doing. Action continues, but it is no more your
action. Now it is natural. If a snake passes by on the footpath, you
have gone for a morning walk and a snake passes by, you simply jump out
of the way of the snake. It is not that you have done it – action has
happened, but it is natural. You did not think about it, you didn’t
ponder over it. You were not ready for it; you may not have come across
a snake ever before in your life. You had not practised it, it is not a
program in your mind. You responded. In the form of the snake, there was
death. You responded – immediately, instantly. The mind never came in,
because the mind needs time to ponder, to think, to contemplate. And
there is no time, death is so close by: you simply jumped.</p><p><br></p><p>Sitting underneath a tree when the snake has passed, you may think
about it; now you have enough time to think. But in that moment, in that
momentous moment when the snake was facing you, you simply acted – not
out of the mind but out of your totality. It was God’s act.</p><p><br></p><p>The man who really wants to become a non-doer starts acting as a
vehicle of the divine, of the whole. Action continues, but the actor
disappears. That is the meaning of non-doing. You live the same life,
but now you have a totally different quality, a different flavor to
it.</p><p><br></p><p>The sutras:</p><p><br></p><p>IF YOU KNOW YOUR OWN WORTH, WHAT NEED YOU CARE ABOUT</p><p>THE ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION OF OTHERS?</p><p><br></p><p>A very fundamental thing. Sanai says: IF YOU KNOW YOUR OWN WORTH you
need not be worried what others think about you, whether they accept you
or reject you. If you are worried about others’ rejection and
acceptance, that simply shows one thing – that you don’t know your own
worth, that you don’t know your own being, that you don’t know God
resides in you, that you are an abode of the divine.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence you are worried what people are thinking about you – because on
their thinking, on their opinion, will depend much. Your ego depends on
others’ opinions: your being depends on nobody. That’s why the man of
being is always a rebel, and the man who lives in the ego has to
compromise very much with the society. The egoist has to compromise,
because if he does not compromise, nobody is going to fulfill his ego.
The ego needs others’ support, it needs props from others: the more
people like you, the better and more polished and refined an ego you can
have.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why people read books like Dale Carnegie’s HOW TO WIN FRIENDS
AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE, or Napoleon Hill, and others. There are thousands
of these so-called philosophers who go on teaching people how to polish
the ego in a better way, how to decorate it.</p><p><br></p><p>The modern mind is very much concerned about it, how you look to
others. Why? Because we have lost all sense of our own being. Now all
that we have is the ego, and the ego needs others’ support.</p><p>If you don’t fulfill their expectations about you, they will withdraw
their support. and the more you fulfill their expectations, the more of
a slave you become. Whatsoever they want you to do, you do. You are just
obedient, constantly compromising. Whether you like it or not does not
matter to you; the whole question is whether others like it. If they
want you to smile, you smile. The smile may be phoney, but that is not
the point – because people like it. And when they like your smile, they
will love you. And when they love you, they will give attention to you,
they will respect you. They will fulfill your need to be needed.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the whole process that we call our life. And if this life
remains a constant frustration, it is not a wonder.</p><p><br></p><p>IF YOU KNOW YOUR OWN WORTH, WHAT NEED YOU CARE ABOUT</p><p>THE ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION OF OTHERS?</p><p><br></p><p>The man who knows himself is completely unworried about what others
say.</p><p><br></p><p>When Jesus was carrying his cross, was he worried about what others
were saying? They were all making him, or trying to make him, a
laughing-stock. They were abusing him, they were making cutting jokes
about him, they were throwing banana skins at him. They were ridiculing
him in every possible way, in a very inhuman way. But was Jesus worried?
Not at all, because they cannot take anything of his being. And what
they can take, he has already renounced; he has dropped all that can be
taken by others. Now he exists as a naked being, his own self, which not
even death can take away. Fire cannot burn it, no sword can cut it. All
that can be taken by others has already been dropped by him. Now people
can laugh: he can watch. He can watch unperturbed undisturbed.</p><p><br></p><p>When Mansoor was killed, he looked at the sky and laughed loudly.
Thousands of people had gathered to ridicule him, to abuse him, to
condemn him. They could not understand why he was laughing. The
situation was such that if he had been crying it would have been okay,
but why was he laughing? And somebody from the crowd asked, “Mansoor,
why are you laughing?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am laughing because you think you are killing ME! You
cannot kill me. And the one you are killing, I am not that. I am
laughing at your foolishness. You are killing my body, it is like
burning my garments – and I am standing there and laughing at the
foolishness of it all. The one you can kill, I have renounced myself.
Only that which is indestructible, only that which is immortal, have I
saved. Now there is no fear: no thief can steal it and no murderer can
kill it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hence, I am laughing. You people who have gathered here are all
stupid – that’s why I am laughing.”</p><p><br></p><p>But th society, from the very beginning, starts taking your
self-worth from you. The child – every child around the earth, in all
the societies – is forced to renounce his being, is forced to accept
others’ opinions about himself. Every child is born absolutely accepting
himself as he is. He has no dislike for himself, he is utterly in love
with himself. Each child is born with great love for himself; he has
self-love, self-respect – because he is not yet a mind.</p><p>But the parents are afraid, the society is afraid: if he remains
being-oriented he will never be a slave. And the society needs slaves,
the society needs obedient people. The society does not need
individuals, it needs phoney personalities. It needs people who are
efficient, but not intelligent. It allows intelligence only to the
extent that you remain efficient, but it does not allow your
intelligence to grow to its maximum – because at the maximum,
intelligence will be so rebellious, so revolutionary, it will be
fire.</p><p><br></p><p>And the society is so rotten, it cannot allow that much fire to
people, that much freedom to people. It needs dead people, dull people,
unintelligent people, so they can go on and on working for others’
interests – for the priest, for the politician, they go on working. It
needs millions of slaves. It’s really a miracle that, once in a while, a
Buddha, a Jesus, a Sanai, escapes from the clutches of the society and
becomes independent.</p><p><br></p><p>The society, from the very beginning, teaches you, “Listen to what
others say about you, because that is what you are.” Now this is so
stupid, the whole idea. Others don’t know themselves, and they decide
who I am. I don’t know about myself, who I am, and I decide about
others, who they are. This is a mutual deception. I don’t know who I am,
you don’t know who you are: you decide about me, I decide about you.
Blind people deciding about each other. Blind people telling each other,
“You are beautiful; your face is so beautiful, or so ugly.” Blind people
deciding who is a sinner and who is a saint.</p><p><br></p><p>And such great fear is created from the very beginning in every child
that your whole life you are tortured by it. If somebody does not think
well of you, you lose your whole night – you cannot sleep: somebody
doesn’t think well of you. How does it matter? Who is he to decide about
you? But the reason is that you have forgotten yourself; you don’t know
who you are. You depend on him – if he doesn’t think well of you, then
something is wrong with you; you start losing self-respect.</p><p><br></p><p>When nobody respects you, how can you respect yourself? Your
self-respect is just a cumulative effect of many people pouring their
respect towards you. And these are the ignorant people, as ignorant as
you are. They know nothing, but this is their way of manipulating each
other. “I respect you, I am paying you, I am bribing you, to be
manipulated by me. You respect me because you want to manipulate
me.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is how it goes on. The man who knows his self-worth, the man who
knows who he is, will remain absolutely unconcerned. And just see the
point: when you are absolutely unconcerned with what people say about
you, you have a freedom, a psychological freedom, you are out of the
psychological slavery of the society. Your soul is born.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am afraid I have developed a terrible habit,” the patient told his
psychiatrist. “Wherever I am, I can’t help talking to myself. Is there
anything you can do for me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I suppose there is,” the psychiatrist replied. “But I should warn
you it will be a long, slow, painful treatment, and very expensive as
well. But suppose you do talk to yourself – is that so bad?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, I guess it isn’t,” the patient agreed. “But I am such a
bore!”</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody can live with himself, hence you need others. They cannot live
alone themselves, hence they need you. They are boring, you are boring –
and both are thinking that by being together the</p><p>boredom will disappear? It will not only be doubled, it will be
multiplied. Have you ever seen more bored people than couples?</p><p><br></p><p>You can see – if a couple is passing by on the road, you can know
immediately whether they are husband and wife or not. If they are
husband and wife, they both look so bored, utterly bored. If the man
looks happy and the woman looks happy, then they are not husband and
wife. She must be a wife to somebody else, and he must be a husband to
somebody else.</p><p><br></p><p>Once I was traveling in a train; a woman was traveling with me, and
her husband or friend was in another compartment. At every station,
wherever the train stopped, he would come again. Sometimes he would
bring ice cream, sometimes sweets, sometimes this and that.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked the woman, “Who is this man?” She said, “He is my
husband.”</p><p>I said, “Don’t lie!”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “How do you know?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Husbands are not known to do such things – at every stop! Once the
husband has escaped from the wife, then only at the last stop does he
turn up if at all. You are fortunate: at each stop he comes bringing
this and that!”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “You are right. He is not my husband, he is just my
boyfriend.” I asked her, “How long have you been together?”</p><p>She said, “Nearabout seven years.” I said, “Wrong again!”</p><p>She said, “How do you know this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Seven years is too long a time! Honeymoons are finished within
fifteen days – and this whole thing seems to be like a honeymoon.”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “You surprise me – we really are going on a honeymoon! I
have known him only for seven or eight days.”</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody is bored with himself. That’s why when Buddha says,
“Sitting silently, I have arrived, and bliss has happened to me,” we
listen to him but we don’t believe him. Or maybe he is just an exception
– because when you sit silently, only boredom happens and nothing
else.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody has tried sometimes to sit silently like a Buddha, but
within minutes you are so fed up with yourself, because the mind goes on
churning and churning, the inner talk continues, and it is boring. you
know these things: you have been boring others, now you are boring
yourself. You have</p><p>heard these things said by your mind so many times, and it goes on
and on with no stop. And all that happens when you are alone is you
become aware of your mind. When you are with others you forget yourself:
you become interested in the other, the other becomes interested in you.
That is a kind of self-deception.</p><p><br></p><p>All meditation techniques say that unless you are capable of being
alone, you will never be able to know your being. It will take a certain
time for the mind t slow down. But if you can sit silently for a few
hours every day, unoccupied, doing nothing – the mind will go mad in the
beginning, will go very crazy, round and round it will run, but if you
can go on patiently waiting and waiting and waiting – you will see that
slowly slowly the momentum of the mind is disappearing. Thoughts are
moving but not so fast – not running but limping, puzzled, looking at
you: “What has happened to you?” They are not so powerful, as if their
life has disappeared; not so self-confident, but shaky, looking at you,
puzzled, wondering, “What are you doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>If you go on watching your thoughts for a certain time, one day the
miracle happens: even if it happens for only a few moments, then you
have looked into your being. In those few moments you have been with
your being; the mind disappeared, there was not a single thought moving
by. And once you have contacted your being, you will never be worried
what others say. They can condemn you, they can think of you as a sinner
or they can worship you, they can think of you as a saint – it is all
the same. Success and failure are the same, fame or defame are the same.
Whether anybody knows about you, or nobody knows about you, is the
same.</p><p><br></p><p>And just contemplate on that quality when nothing affects you: for
the first time you are rooted, for the first time you are centered,
integrated, for the first time the mind is not and you are.</p><p><br></p><p>WORSHIP HIM AS IF YOU COULD SEE HIM WITH YOUR PHYSICAL EYES; THOUGH
YOU DON’T SEE HIM,</p><p>HE SEES YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>And only when you have become completely indifferent to what people
say about you will you be able to face God. Otherwise you remain facing
people. When you have become utterly indifferent to what people say
about you, you are capable of turning God-wards. Otherwise your eyes and
your ears and your senses are all focused on others; they are outgoing,
they are not ingoing.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you have become capable of dropping people and what they say
about you, your energy is available to move God-wards. WORSHIP HIM...
now let your energy become worship. And by ‘worship’ is meant wonder,
awe, love. By ‘worship’ is not meant any formal worship: going to a
temple and worshipping a statue – that is not meant. Worship is a new
vision, a new insight into reality.</p><p><br></p><p>When the child looks at the sun rising, look into his eyes: that is
worship – he is so mystified, in such awe. When the child looks at the
starry night, look into his eyes: those stars reflected in his eyes,
that is worship.</p><p>The child knows what worship is. We have forgotten, because we have
forgotten the language of wonder. We have become too knowledgeable: when
the sun rises, we know what it is. Nobody really knows, but we have been
to school, to college, to university, so we have become knowledgeable.
When a flower blooms, we know what the name of the flower is, what
species it belongs to, and from what country it comes. But all these
things are meaningless, irrelevant.</p><p><br></p><p>Something wonderful is happening: the flower has opened, the
fragrance is released. The flower is utterly beautiful, alive, and you
simply label it. You say, “This is a rose” – and you think you have
known it just by giving it a name? You have missed. You have
de-mystified the flower, and hence you have missed the wonder of it.
Otherwise, each flower will give a thrill to your heart, each star will
give it a new beat and each bird will start singing within you.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is so psychedelic, it is such a splendor. To feel the wonder of
it, to feel the awe, is worship. And then in some unknown moment you may
bow down to existence. You may kneel down on the earth, or you may fall
on the sand, in great prayer, in great love, as if the earth is your
mother – it is: the existence is your mother – and great love will
upsurge in you. That upsurging love is worship.</p><p><br></p><p>WORSHIP HIM AS IF YOU COULD SEE HIM WITH YOUR PHYSICAL EYES; THOUGH
YOU DON’T SEE HIM,</p><p>HE SEES YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you are in a worshipful moment, you will be surprised: the
whole existence is watching you, the whole existence is looking at you,
is caressing you, is caring about you. You will feel some invisible
hands caressing you, some invisible eyes looking at you, some invisible
energy embracing you.</p><p><br></p><p>WHILST IN THIS LAND</p><p><br></p><p>OF FRUITLESS PURSUITS,</p><p><br></p><p>YOU ARE ALWAYS UNBALANCED, ALWAYS EITHER ALL BACK OR ALL FRONT;</p><p>BUT ONCE THE SEEKING SOUL HAS PROGRESSED JUST A FEW PACES BEYOND THIS
STATE,</p><p>LOVE SEIZES THE REINS.</p><p><br></p><p>If you allow worship to happen, love soon arrives – and a love that
you have not even dreamt about. The love that you know is not real love,
because there is no feeling of mystery in it, no awe, no worship, no
prayer, in it.</p><p>If you really love a woman, you will love her as a goddess. If you
really love a man, you will love him as a god. There is no other way to
love. Love transforms everything into the divine; that is love’s
chemistry. If love does not do that, then it must be something else. It
may be lust, it may be sexual desire. It may be just a need – physical,
psychological.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is not a need! Love is an overflowing of joy. It happens only to
worshippers, to prayerful people. Otherwise, you remain in this futile
world – THIS LAND OF FRUITLESS PURSUITS. From your childhood to your old
age, what do you go on doing? Playing with toys.</p><p><br></p><p>The little boy was sitting on the curb, crying, and an old man who
was passing by came over to him. “What’s the matter, little boy?” he
asked. “Why are you crying?”</p><p>The little boy said, “I’m crying because I can’t do what big boys
do.” The old man sat down on the curb and cried too.</p><p>There is not much difference: children are childish, but your
so-called old people are just as childish as children, sometimes even
more so. Maturity is very rare; people remain immature. If you are
interested only in toys – possessing this, possessing that, becoming
famous, reaching some political power, prestige, having money, becoming
very famous in the world – if you are interested in these things, you
remain part of this stupid world of futile fruitless pursuits. But those
pursuits keep you engages, they keep you occupied. They are
intoxicants.</p><p><br></p><p>And the most surprising thing is that from this fruitless futile
world, the world of fruitfulness is not far away. It is very close by,
just around the corner.</p><p><br></p><p>Jim and Joe were two friends who shared an apartment together in
Chicago. One day, Jim came home to find Joe weeping into his hands. “I
am so unlucky! So unlucky!” he moaned.</p><p><br></p><p>“You are always saying that, and it is not so,” Jim said.</p><p><br></p><p>“It is! It is!” Joe said. “I’m the most unlucky fellow you know!”
“What happened now?”</p><p>“Well, I met this beautiful woman on Madison Street. We go to talking
and we stopped off at a small bar and had a few drinks. Wow! We got
really mellow. When she suggested that I should go to her place, I
thought my luck had changed.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It sounds like it did,” Jim said.</p><p><br></p><p>“Minutes after we entered her apartment I was in bed with her. I was
just starting to climax when we heard the door bang open.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s my husband!” she said.</p><p>“I didn’t even have time to grab a towel. I bounded for the window
and just managed to climb out, hanging on the ledge by my hands, when he
barged in.</p><p><br></p><p>“He sized up the scene immediately, and then he saw my hands hanging
on for dear life. He came to the window and started pounding my knuckles
with a hammer. Then he pissed all over me. Then he slammed the window on
my bloody fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then, as if I did not have enough trouble, two old ladies on the
street saw me hanging there stark naked and they started screaming for
the police. The cops came and I was arrested. Now do you see what I mean
when I say I am unlucky?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nonsense,” Jim said, “You are upset, but an experience like that
could happen to anyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t understand,” Joe said. “When the cops came to arrest me, I
looked down and my feet were only four inches from the ground. Now do
you see what I mean when I say I’m unlucky?”</p><p><br></p><p>The other world is not far away! It is just around the corner – not
even a distance of four inches. Just a little change of your focus, of
your consciousness, of your awareness, and you move from this to that.
And it can happen any moment. All that is needed is the understanding
that whatsoever you have been doing up to now, and you are doing now, is
futile. Let this sink into your heart as deeply as possible, that
whatsoever you are doing is futile.</p><p><br></p><p>Money is not going to help, fame is not going to help, power is not
going to help. Death will come and all will be snatched away from you.
And what does it matter how much money you have got? The only real thing
in the world is how much being you have got.</p><p><br></p><p>Having is the fallen state: being is Christ risen, resurrected. WHILE
THIS WORLD REMAINS,</p><p>THAT ONE CANNOT BE; WHILST YOU EXIST,</p><p>GOD CANNOT BE YOURS.</p><p><br></p><p>You can have only one world: this or that. Either you can have the
world of dreams, then you cannot have the world with open eyes, the
world of waking. If you have the world of waking, you cannot have the
world of dreams. And people have chosen the world of dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>Why have people chosen the world of dreams? For one reason only: they
have been forced to forget their reality. And when you do not know your
reality, you have to create something to cling to, you have to create a
substitute. Nothing is not acceptable: then anything is better than
nothing, then even a dream is better than nothing. Then even remaining
occupied in futile things is okay – at least one is occupied, one is not
wasting one’s time; at least one is doing something, at least one is
searching, at least one need not sit and cry for one’s fallen state.</p><p>At least it keeps you intoxicated: it keeps you hoping – “It has not
happened today, but tomorrow it is going to happen.” It goes on creating
tomorrows. And you know it has not happened yesterday, and it has not
happened today. Yesterday also you were thinking it would happen
tomorrow, today also you are thinking it will happen tomorrow, and
tomorrow also you will go on thinking and postponing.</p><p>It keeps you, in a certain way, sane. Otherwise nothing is happening
– and that will drive you insane.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen masters, Sufi masters, Hassid masters, all the great masters of
the world say one thing, that a disciple should not try sitting silently
without a master. Why? Because if a disciple tries sitting silently
without a master, soon he will start going crazy. The world of dreams
will start disappearing. That was his world, the only world he had ever
known – it will start disappearing into the far faraway distance like
clouds dispersing. And the other world has not come yet; it will come
only when the world of dreams has completely gone away, totally gone
away. Even if a slight thin layer of dreams is there, it is not possible
to see the real.</p><p>You can have either the dreams or the reality; when all the dreams
are gone, the reality will happen. But that will take time. When ninety
percent of the dreams are gone, still you have not known the reality.
When ninety-nine percent of the dreams are gone, still you have not
known the reality. And now you will start becoming very shaky: all that
you had is disappearing down the drain, and nothing else has
happened.</p><p>The mind will say, “Rush and catch hold of the disappearing dreams.”
Nothingness frightens, nothingness looks like death. You will need
somebody to give you the feeling that “Don’t be worried, it is perfectly
all right, this is how it happens. This is how it happened to me too.
Just a little more – wait a little more, have a little more patience:
that one percent of the dream will also disappear.” And it is very
scary. The space is maddening.</p><p>The master is needed to keep you patient, the master is needed to
help you not to become too frightened. The fear is natural: you are
falling into an abyss, you are disappearing – because with your
possessions your ego will disappear, with your doings your ego will
disappear. And, slowly slowly, you will find a nothingness: you were
looking for God, you were looking for truth. You were looking for
something immortal, deathless – and instead of deathlessness happening,
death is happening. There is every possibility that if you are alone,
you will rush away. A master is needed.</p><p>And all the great masters have created Buddhafields. If a field can
be created, it is even more helpful. When there are millions of people
meditating, a great field is created. You are not alone: there are
people ahead of you, there are people behind you. The people who are
ahead are telling you, “Yes, this happens, but it disappears.” And you
can tell people who are behind you, “Yes, this happens, what is
happening to you, but it disappears.” You are in a chain.</p><p>That’s why communes have been created, down the ages. Around each
great master a commune arises – it has to arise. It creates a certain
energy-field: in that energy-field, people can grow more easily. It
becomes the Garden.</p><p>Hakim Sanai has called this book THE WALLED GARDEN OF TRUTH: the
HADIQA.</p><p><br></p><p>When there are thousands of trees blooming, new seeds can take
courage and jump into the soil and die, because they know it happens. So
many trees are saying, so many flowers are declaring, “Don’t be worried.
Disappear into the soil and you will resurrect. This happened to
us.”</p><p>WHILE THIS WORLD REMAINS, THAT ONE CANNOT BE; WHILST YOU EXIST,</p><p>GOD CANNOT BE YOURS.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to disappear like a seed into the soil. That disappearance
looks like death – it is not. Only apparently do you die: in fact you
are born for the first time. It is resurrection, it is rebirth, you
become twice-born. And for the first time you know something of the
immortal. You are carrying it in a seed form, and you can know it only
when it becomes a flower, when it becomes a fragrance.</p><p><br></p><p>The seed is gross; the seed is only the potential. Unless it becomes
actual, you will not be able to see it; it will remain hidden. And if
you cut open a seed, you will not find it either. So if somebody goes to
the surgeon and asks him, “Is there God in me?” the surgeon can cut him
open and look inside, but he will not find any God anywhere. No X-ray
machine is going to give you a picture of your soul.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why science goes on saying there is no God, no soul – they are
simply dissecting the seed. The seed has not to be dissected; the seed
has to fall into the soil and disappear there in the darkness of the
soil, in the womb of the earth. It has to disappear there.</p><p><br></p><p>The master is a womb, the commune is a greater womb: the disciple
comes and disappears into the womb. And then one day when the season is
ripe, when the spring has come, something sprouts – something that you
could never have imagined in the seed. Those two green leaves... and the
tree has started growing.</p><p><br></p><p>THE COMING OF DEATH</p><p><br></p><p>IS THE KEY WHICH UNLOCKS THE UNKNOWN DOMAIN;</p><p>BUT FOR DEATH, THE DOOR OF TRUE FAITH WOULD REMAIN UNOPENED.</p><p>So don’t be afraid of this death that the seed has to face. Every
disciple has to face it. THE COMING OF DEATH...</p><p>So when death starts coming to you, don’t be afraid. It is the
beginning of a new life, of life abundant. That is the meaning of the
story that Jesus is crucified, and after three days he is resurrected.
This is not a historical fact. If you try to make it history you destroy
its beauty, you destroy its poetry, you destroy its grandeur. You bring
it into the world of facts. It is not a fact, it is an eternal myth. It
happened before Jesus; it has happened to every master, it has to happen
to every disciple. It is an eternal truth: the story simply depicts it,
describes it. But don’t reduce it to historical fact.</p><p>Christians go on destroying the beautiful story of Jesus’ life; they
try to make it historical. If this resurrection of Jesus is historical,
you have brought it into time, into the ordinary world of facts where
Adolf Hitlers and Mussolinis exists. You have brought it into the ugly
world of history, of time, of events. It is not an event, it never
happened – although it always happens.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the essential truth of every seeker’s life. Every seeker has to
die on the cross, and after three days – those three days are of
waiting, symbolically of waiting – the spring can come and the
resurrection.</p><p><br></p><p>THE COMING OF DEATH</p><p><br></p><p>IS THE KEY WHICH UNLOCKS THE UNKNOWN DOMAIN...</p><p>Only by dying does the seed unlock the door and the tree starts
growing. Only by dying as Adam do you unlock the door of
Christ-consciousness in you. Only by dying as a mind do you unlock the
door of being.</p><p><br></p><p>THE COMING OF DEATH</p><p><br></p><p>IS THE KEY WHICH UNLOCKS THE UNKNOWN DOMAIN;</p><p>BUT FOR DEATH, THE DOOR OF TRUE FAITH WOULD REMAIN UNOPENED.</p><p>So death is also beautiful. And remember, we are not talking of
physical death at all: we are talking of psychological death. We are
talking of the death of the ego, of egoing.</p><p><br></p><p>IF YOU YOURSELF</p><p><br></p><p>ARE UPSIDE DOWN IN REALITY, THEN YOUR WISDOM AND FAITH ARE BOUND TO
BE TOPSY-TURVY.</p><p>And this is how we are. Being has been forgotten – which we are. And
we have become identified with the mind – which we are not. This is the
topsy-turvy state: the real is forgotten, and the unreal is pretending
to be the real.</p><p><br></p><p>In this state you cannot know that which is. God surrounds you, truth
surrounds you, but you cannot know God, you cannot know truth, because
you are standing upside down. First you have to become true. To know
truth, you have to become truth: you have to reach back to the source,
you have to search and grope.</p><p>You are lost in the world of having. You have come into the world of
having by the staircase of doing – now move backwards. When you move
backwards on the same ladder, it is non-doing, because doing is less and
less and less and then it disappears. And the first taste of being is
the beginning of a totally new life – the life of eternity.</p><p><br></p><p>So there were these two blacks from a southern town, and they wanted
women desperately but couldn’t find any. They were driving along the
country road when they spotted a pig. One of the jumped out, scooped up
the pig and stuck it on the seat between them.</p><p><br></p><p>They continued to chug along in their 1969 Ford when a police siren
suddenly sounded behind them. A glance at the rear-view mirror showed
them that a police car was in hot pursuit. They pulled over to the side.
Not wanting to be caught with a stolen pig, they tossed a blanket over
it.</p><p><br></p><p>The officer came up to the side of their car. “What are you up to?”
he asked. “We were just out looking for women,” one of the lads replied
truthfully.</p><p>Suddenly the pig sticks its face through the folds of the
blanket.</p><p><br></p><p>The cop stared, shook his head sadly, and said, “Lady, can you tell
me what a nice southern girl like you is doing with these two
blacks?”</p><p><br></p><p>Man is in such an unconscious state! Man is almost drunk. He cannot
see what is; he goes on believing what others say. He does not respect
his own eyes, his own ears; he does not respect his own sensibilities.
He has become very insensitive.</p><p><br></p><p>You go on believing what others say. Somebody says, “This is the
house of God. This is the temple, or the synagogue, or the church,” and
you start believing them, and you go and start worshipping a stone.</p><p><br></p><p>And this foolishness, this utter stupidity, is thought to be
religious. Religion belongs only to intelligence; religion is the
flowering of intelligence. Just think about it again: what have you been
doing in the name of religion? Repeating, imitating – what others have
said, you have believed it. When you are going to look for yourself?
When are you going to think for yourself?</p><p><br></p><p>Only by thinking for yourself, only by looking into things for your
own self, will you be able, slowly slowly, to awaken. Otherwise this
dream is going to continue. It has continued for long, it can continue
for eternity – unless you take hold of your own being, unless you start
working on your intelligence, unless you start sharpening your own
intelligence. Nobody will help, remember. And if you can find somebody
to help, then that is your master.</p><p><br></p><p>People will help you to remain mediocre, because that is how they can
go on exploiting you. If you can find somebody who is ready to help you
to sharpen your intelligence, then be with that person: you have found a
friend. It is very difficult to find a friend in this world, this world
is very unfriendly. Everybody is interested in his own exploiting – and
people who want to exploit you cannot want you to become
intelligent.</p><p>My effort here is to sharpen your intelligence as much as possible.
The whole process of this commune is that of sharpening your
intelligence, so that you can stand on your own feet.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t go on repeating things like parrots, otherwise you will never
become a man.</p><p><br></p><p>Mrs. Keller had a very talented parrot. At her dinner parties he was
the center of attention, for she had trained him to repeat what the
butler said when he announced the guests as they arrived.</p><p><br></p><p>The parrot had only one failing: he loved to make love to chickens.
Every chance he got, he would fly over the fence into the yard of the
farmer next door and make love to his chickens.</p><p><br></p><p>The farmer complained to Mrs. Keller, and finally she laid the law
down to the parrot. “Bertram,” she said, “you better listen to me! The
next time you go into Farmer Whalen’s yard I’m going to punish you
plenty!”</p><p><br></p><p>The parrot hung his head to show he understood. But two days later,
he couldn’t resist temptation and over the fence he went. He was deep
into lovemaking with the third hen when Farmer Whalen spotted him and
chased him. Whalen complained again to Mrs. Keller.</p><p><br></p><p>“Now you’re going to get it,” she said. She got a pair of barber’s
shears and clipped all the feathers from the top of the parrot’s
head.</p><p><br></p><p>That night, Mrs. Keller threw one of her gala parties. She put the
parrot on top of the piano.</p><p><br></p><p>“Bertram,” she said, “you’ve been a rotten old thing. Tonight you’re
to sit here all night. No wandering around and no playing the way you
usually do!”</p><p><br></p><p>And so, feeling rather disconsolate, the parrot sat on the piano. As
the butler announced the guests, Bertram performed as usual, repeating
the names. The butler said, “Mr. Arnold Levy and Lady Stella,” and the
parrot said, “Mr. Arnold Levy and Lady Stella.” The butler said, “Mr.
and Mrs. Robert Salomon,” and the parrot said, “Mr. and Mrs. Robert
Salomon.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then two bald-headed men entered the room. Without waiting for the
butler to announce them, the parrot shouted, “All right, so you’ve also
been caught making love to chickens? Ha, ha! Up here on the piano with
me!”</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, you are not a parrot, you are a man. Respect your manhood,
respect the intelligence that has been given to you. Respect the gift of
God and sharpen it, grow into it, let it come to an optimum.</p><p><br></p><p>People use only five percent of their potential – that’s what
psychologists have come to know. Even people who are thought to be very
talented don’t use more than ten percent, and the people who are known
as geniuses use only fifteen percent of their intelligence. Can you
imagine what we have been missing? Can you imagine? If people use a
hundred percent of their intelligence, this earth will become unique,
this earth will be a paradise. There will be no need to think of a
paradise after death, the paradise will be herenow.</p><p>It is possible – God has given you the potential. But the politicians
and the priests have not allowed you to use it, and your so-called
priests are all against it.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can find a man who helps you to sharpen your intelligence, who
respects your intelligence, who wants you to grow it to the maximum so
you can become aflame with intelligence, then you have found the
master.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the only requirement that has to be fulfilled by a real
master. And that is the only criterion by which you can understand
whether you have come to a real master or not. And it is so simple, it
is so obvious, when you come across a person who helps you to sharpen
your consciousness, who helps you to go beyond the mediocrity that
society has imposed upon you.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop your mediocre selves. Inside you is a source of great
intelligence, of divine intelligence. STOP WEAVING A NET ABOUT
YOURSELF:</p><p>BURST LIKE A LION FROM THE CAGE.</p><p><br></p><p>This is how a real master gives his message. Sanai says:</p><p><br></p><p>STOP WEAVING A NET ABOUT YOURSELF...</p><p><br></p><p>Stop weaving the nets of thoughts, desires, ambitions, imaginations.
STOP WEAVING A NET ABOUT YOURSELF:</p><p>BURST LIKE A LION FROM THE CAGE.</p><p><br></p><p>The cage in which you have been put by the society. Burst forth! Give
a lion’s roar! And come out of the dreams into which you have fallen, in
which you are trapped. Become rebellious, be revolutionaries.</p><p><br></p><p>MELT YOURSELF DOWN IN THIS SEARCH:</p><p><br></p><p>VENTURE YOUR LIFE AND YOUR SOUL IN THE PATH OF SINCERITY...</p><p>Only one thing has to be remembered: be authentic, be sincere to
yourself. Declare your truth, whatsoever the cost. Even if life is
risked, risk it, because truth is far more valuable than anything,
because truth is true life. Risk all – be authentic! Whatsoever you are,
stick to it! Don’t allow anybody to manipulate you, don’t allow anybody
to enslave you. And MELT YOURSELF DOWN IN THIS SEARCH – and let the ego
melt.</p><p><br></p><p>You have become frozen ice cubes: let these ice cubes melt. And once
they have melted, they start flowing, they become alive and dynamic.</p><p><br></p><p>MELT YOURSELF DOWN IN THIS SEARCH:</p><p>VENTURE YOUR LIFE AND YOUR SOUL IN THE PATH OF SINCERITY;</p><p>STRIVE TO PASS FROM NOTHINGNESS TO BEING,</p><p><br></p><p>AND MAKE YOURSELF DRUNK WITH THE WINE OF GOD.</p><p><br></p><p>You have been drinking many kinds of wines of this world – of money,
power, fame: they are all poisons. But there is a wine – the wine of
God, the wine of love, the wine of meditativeness, the wine that pours
from the beyond into your heart. Become available to it.</p><p><br></p><p>And how does one become available to it? Be open. And only an
authentic person can be an open person. The person who is not authentic,
who is not true to himself, who is pretending to be somebody he is not,
cannot be open. He is a lie: he has to hide the lie in many ways.</p><p><br></p><p>Only a truthful person can be open – he has nothing to hide, he has
nothing to protect. His whole periphery, his whole circumference, is
open to existence; three hundred and sixty degrees of circumference are
open to existence. He contacts existence from every direction, from all
directions. He is available to reality, totally available.</p><p><br></p><p>People who live as lies cannot be totally available; they are always
afraid they may be caught lying. They have to protect themselves, they
have to create an armour around themselves. They are open only in small
ways – maybe just a keyhole from where they look into the world, and
through which the world enters into them. But it can’t be much of a
world. Through a keyhole the sun cannot enter much, and the winds cannot
come in, and the rains cannot come in. And behind the keyhole you are
hiding yourself and looking through the keyhole – whatsoever you
perceive is going to be very partial. And everybody claims his partial
vision as the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Bursts forth from this cage. And that is possible only if you respect
yourself, if you feel the dignity of being here, if you feel that God
has created you as a unique being. He has never created anybody like
you, and he will never create anybody like you again. You are unique,
you are incomparable. Feel this gift, this grace, and respect
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>The man who respects himself is authentic. He cannot compromise: he
would prefer to die but stick to his truth. And that is the price God
asks for. Risk all that you have – because you don’t have anything, you
only think you have. In reality, you are a nothingness.</p><p><br></p><p>Sanai says:</p><p><br></p><p>STRIVE TO PASS FROM NOTHINGNESS TO BEING,</p><p><br></p><p>AND MAKE YOURSELF DRUNK WITH THE WINE OF GOD.</p><p><br></p><p>Be open, and God starts pouring into you like wine from every nook
and corner of existence. Then wherever you look, you find God. Then
whatsoever you touch, you find God. Then whatsoever you drink and eat,
you find God. And when God pours from everywhere, then life is a
celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

‌CHAPTER 1
On the Road of Sighs
11 December 1978 am in Buddha Hall
MY FRIEND, EVERYTHING EXISTING EXISTS THROUGH HIM;
YOUR OWN EXISTENCE IS A MERE PRETENSE. NO MORE NONSENSE! LOSE YOURSELF,
AND THE HELL OF YOUR HEART BECOMES A HEAVEN. LOSE YOURSELF, AND ANYTHING CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED. YOUR SELFISHNESS IS AN UNTRAINED COLT.
YOU ARE WHAT YOU ARE:
HENCE YOUR LOVES AND HATES; YOU ARE WHAT YOU ARE:</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
We Shall Meet Again
20 December 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
BELOVED MASTER,
Question 1
JESUS TAUGHT HIS FOLLOWERS TO LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS THYSELF. COULD YOU GIVE US YOUR VIEWS ON CARING, COMPASSION AND SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY?
Ann, Jesus’ statement is tremendously significant but has been totally missed by his followers. Let me repeat it: Jesus says, “Love thy neighbor as THYSELF.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Defeating Buddha
12 December 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
BELOVED MASTER, WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR?
Deva Parmita, man is a search for the self – not for A self but for THE self. Man is constantly seeking the lost paradise: somewhere deep in the recesses of human beings, the nostalgia persists. We have known something that is only a far faraway memory, The memory is not even conscious; we have lost all track of it, where it is.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
The Death of the Seed
13 December 1978 am in Buddha Hall
IF YOU KNOW YOUR OWN WORTH, WHAT NEED YOU CARE ABOUT
THE ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION OF OTHERS? WORSHIP HIM AS IF YOU COULD SEE
HIM WITH YOUR PHYSICAL EYES; THOUGH YOU DON’T SEE HIM, HE SEES YOU.
WHILST IN THIS LAND
OF FRUITLESS PURSUITS,
YOU ARE ALWAYS UNBALANCED, ALWAYS EITHER ALL BACK OR ALL FRONT;</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
A Buddhafield in Spring
14 December 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
IN YESTERDAY’S LECTURE YOU SAID THAT PROGRAMS, NAMES AND LABELS AND BECOMING CRYSTALLIZED AND IDENTIFIED ARE HINDRANCES AND LIABILITIES IN THE SEEKER’S SEARCH FOR THE SUPREME SELF. THIS IS SO FOR ME. I DON’T WANT A LABEL. I WANT TO BE VAST, UNLIMITED. I DON’T WANT TO BE CRYSTALLIZED.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
The Forgotten Shepherd
15 December 1978 am in Buddha Hall
FROM HIM FORGIVENESS COMES SO FAST, IT REACHES US BEFORE REPENTANCE HAS EVEN TAKEN SHAPE ON OUR LIPS.
HE IS YOUR SHEPHERD,
AND YOU PREFER THE WOLF; HE INVITES YOU TO HIM,
AND YET YOU STAY UNFED;
HE GIVES YOU HIS PROTECTION, YET YOU ARE SOUND ASLEEP: OH, WELL DONE,
YOU SENSELESS UPSTART FOOL!</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
Back to Eros
16 December 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
BELOVED MASTER,
Question 1
I HAVE BEEN A DEVOTEE OF BABA MUKTANANDA AND RAN A CENTER FOR HIM. I EXPERIENCED A PERIOD OF EXTREME DIFFICULTY AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL I READ YOUR BOOKS THAT I UNDERSTOOD ALL THAT WAS AND STILL IS HAPPENING.
I QUESTION THE NEED TO BE ATTACHED TO ANOTHER TEACHER, ALTHOUGH I FEEL AND UNDERSTAND YOUR TEACHINGS DEEPLY.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
The Sacred Explosion
17 December 1978 am in Buddha Hall LOVE’S CONQUEROR IS HE WHOM LOVE CONQUERS.
APPLY YOURSELF, HAND AND FOOT,
TO THE SEARCH;
BUT WHEN YOU REACH THE SEA, STOP TALKING OF THE STREAM.
WHEN HE ADMITS YOU TO HIS PRESENCE
ASK FROM HIM NOTHING OTHER THAN HIMSELF. WHEN HE HAS CHOSEN YOU FOR A FRIEND, YOU HAVE SEEN ALL THAT THERE IS TO SEE.</description>

Dying in Wonder
18 December 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
BELOVED MASTER,
Question 1
YOU APPEAR TO HAVE MADE A POINT OF ATTACKING THE PRIME MINISTER, MORARJI DESAI, AND BACKING INDIRA GANDHI, THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER, WITH ALL THE SPIRITUAL POWER AT YOUR COMMAND. WHAT IS THE BACKGROUND? DO YOU WISH TO REPLACE MR. DESAI WITH MRS. GANDHI? IN ANY CASE, IS SUCH AN INTERVENTION IN INDIAN POLITICAL AFFAIRS BY A SPIRITUAL PERSON JUSTIFIED?</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
Beyond the Shadow
19 December 1978 am in Buddha Hall NOT ONE KNOWS HOW FAR IT IS FROM NOTHINGNESS TO GOD.
AS LONG AS YOU CLING TO YOUR SELF
YOU WILL WANDER RIGHT AND LEFT,
DAY AND NIGHT, FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS; AND WHEN, AFTER ALL THAT EFFORT,
YOU FINALLY OPEN YOUR EYES,
YOU WILL SEE YOUR SELF, THROUGH INHERENT DEFECTS, WANDERING AROUND ITSELF LIKE THE OX IN A MILL;</description>

I EXPERIENCED A PERIOD OF EXTREME DIFFICULTY AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL I READ YOUR BOOKS THAT I UNDERSTOOD ALL THAT WAS AND STILL IS HAPPENING.\nI QUESTION THE NEED TO BE ATTACHED TO ANOTHER TEACHER, ALTHOUGH I FEEL AND UNDERSTAND YOUR TEACHINGS DEEPLY. I KNOW I CANNOT GO BACK TO BABA’S METHODS. I’M CONFUSED – CAN YOU HELP?\nBernadette Brown, only a disciple can be helped. And the disciple has to become involved, committed. Without commitment there is no possibility of any help. A tree has to be rooted in the soil, only then can it grow. If it starts talking about not getting attached to the earth, it will die.\nWhy are you afraid of getting attached to a new master? Do you think you have gone beyond attachment? Is it really non-attachment? Or is it just the attachment to the old teacher that is hindering your path?\nYou are still attached to a person to whom you think you cannot go back. Now, this is unintelligent. Remain attached to him by all means, if you feel you are growing there – that is intelligence.\nWherever growth is happening, wherever you are getting more and more mature, more and more blissful, remain attached by all means.\nBut the moment growth has stopped, the moment you can see that you are not going anywhere, or going round in circles, it is time to become detached. Seek new soil, seek new lands, new pastures. And one has to go on seeking till one becomes a master in one’s own right.\nWhy be afraid of the new? You are attached to yesterday’s sun, and a new sun has risen today. And because of your attachment to yesterday’s sun you are keeping your eyes closed! Your fear is that of betrayal. But what can you do? It is not that you are betraying anybody, it is simply a search for your own growth – and that is your responsibility.\nAnd you will have to go on seeking, searching. On and on one has to go, till one arrives at one’s own being. And learn from everywhere, and don’t be so miserly. Now you want my help, but without becoming attached to me. It is impossible; you will have to be plugged in with we.\nThat’s what sannyas is all about. Unless you are plugged in, my energy cannot flow into you. You can go on reading my books, but that is quite a different matter. It will remain intellectual, it will never become existential.\nIt is a totally different phenomenon when you are a sannyasin and you listen to my words than when you are not a sannyasin and you listen to my words. They are the same words, but the meaning is totally different.\nWhen you are in a love relationship with me, those words simply become aflame. They have a light in them, they are luminous. They are not ordinary words; they are words of your master, they are words coming from a source to which you have become devoted. They are really YOUR words – as if your own being has spoken to you. There is intimacy, there is love. And in that love, the miracle happens.\nIt is up to you. But don’t be clever; that cleverness will not help. To be with me means to be involved with me. You can be here, but if you are not with me, your being here is superficial. You will remain on the periphery, you will remain an outsider. And great secrets can only be delivered in deep intimacy. They can be only delivered through love.\nYou say: I HAVE BEEN A DEVOTEE OF BABA MUKTANANDA...\nIt is already a “have been,” it is finished. You have learned whatsoever you could learn from him; you have grown out of it, you have passed that class. Now enter into a new class, enter into a new land, explore this new country.\nYou say: AND I RAN A CENTER FOR HIM. I EXPERIENCED A PERIOD OF EXTREME DIFFICULTY AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL I READ YOUR BOOKS THAT I UNDERSTOOD ALL THAT WAS AND STILL IS HAPPENING.\nIf just by reading my books you have been helped, then think what is possible if you get involved with me. Even the impossible is possible.\nAnd Muktananda has helped you, that’s why you are here. It is not betraying him. He has helped in his own way; without him you would not have been here. But now you have to go beyond. You have used the boat, now you have to leave it behind. Don’t become too attached to the boat, otherwise the whole journey becomes absurd. If you are too attached to the boat you will not leave it; you will not get to the other shore, and you will be puzzled and you will be confused.\nReading my books is an intellectual way of communicating with me. Being a disciple is a non- intellectual, intuitive way of communing with me. Reading my books, listening to my words, is from head to head. Becoming a sannyasin is from heart to heart.\nYes, a few things can be communicated through the head, through words, but those few things are not really the heart of the matter. The real heart of the matter can be communicated only from heart to heart. Only in tremendous devotion, receptivity, passionate love, surrender, in trust, does the flame jump from the master to the disciple And the flame can jump only when you have come very close.\nIt is up to you.\nYou ask: I QUESTION THE NEED TO BE ATTACHED TO ANOTHER TEACHER.\nIf you are still attached to Muktananda, go back to him, forget all about me. Then I am not for you. But don’t become confused, because I am a totally different kind of man. Then you will remain attached to the primary class, then you can go on playing the same game again and again.\nMuktananda is a teacher – orthodox, conventional, a puritan, part of the status quo, traditional. I am just the opposite: I am not a teacher, I am not teaching you any doctrine, I am not giving you any creed.\nThe word ‘creed’ is beautiful, it comes from a root CREDERE: CREDERE means ‘to believe’. I am not giving you any belief-system, I am destroying all belief-systems.\nMuktananda has given you a belief-system. He is an ordinary teacher, in the service of the society, in the service of the past, in the service of this rotten structure, establishment. He is not a master.\nI have seen him, I have met him: there is no fire in him. Nothing has happened in him – or whatsoever has happened is very ordinary, can happen to anybody. Those type of things happen in India to thousands of people. He has no insight, he is not an enlightened person. You can remain attached to him and you can go on playing the game, but you will remain in a very primary state.\nAnd I am not saying that he has not helped you – even a primary class helps, otherwise nobody would ever enter into the university. But I am a totally different kind of person, diametrically opposite. I teach you rebellion. I am against the whole past, I am all for the present. And the future is going to be born out of the present.\nI am not for the establishment. My whole work here is to create a totally different kind of humanity. The humanity that has existed up till now is ill, abnormal, neurotic. I don’t belong to any tradition: I am not a Hindu, not a Christian, not a Mohammedan. I am utterly finished with the past, and I teach the same to you.\nI don’t give you a doctrine, I give you an insight into reality. I don’t give you a belief, I take all beliefs and prejudices away from you, so that you can become a clean clear mirror and that which is can be reflected in you.\nBut this is possible only if you come close to me. The closer you are, the better. And by being closer I don’t mean a physical closeness, I mean a spiritual closeness.\nYou say: I QUESTION THE NEED TO BE ATTACHED TO ANOTHER TEACHER ALTHOUGH I FEEL AND UNDERSTAND YOUR TEACHINGS DEEPLY.\nNow you will be in turmoil. You are creating a split in yourself. Your heart is finished with your so-called teacher, Muktananda; just your mind is clinging. Your heart will be with me now, and your mind will go on clinging to the past. The mind always clings to the past. The mind is absolutely against the present and the future; it lives, exists, on the past, on the dead. Now you will be in a great split; your mind will say one thing, and your heart will say another thing.\nAnd my ways are so totally different from your other so-called teachers that the rift will become bigger and bigger every day. Either burn all my books and forget all about me – be at peace at least; you will remain stupid but there will be peace – or be finished with your old attachments. Then you can start growing again.\nI can help you.\nYou say: I KNOW I CANNOT GO BACK TO BABA’S METHODS.\nThere is not much of a method to your Baba Muktananda. It is so childish, the whole thing is so unintelligent! But there are people who need it; there are people who can only understand a very superficial thing. It is fortunate that you have grown out of that need. Now please don’t go on carrying your childhood clothes with you: they won’t fit you, they will suffocate you.\nAnd your devotion is towards truth. If your devotion is towards truth, then from wherever it comes, you have to bow down there, you have to surrender there.\nYou say: I AM CONFUSED – CAN YOU HELP?\nI can help. But, Bernadette Brown, can you take my help? That’s the question. The crux of the matter is not can I help – can you take it, can you receive it?\nSannyas is just a gesture from your side that you are ready to receive it. And I can give it to you only when you are ready to receive it.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2\nIF THE SELF IS THE SAME IN ALL MEN, DOES THIS MEAN THAT ALL MEN ARE IDENTICAL? IF SO, HOW CAN ANY ONE MAN BE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF CREATION?\nRichard Mitchley, the supreme self is the same in all men. And not only in all men but in all beings – men, animals, birds, trees, rocks. The supreme self is the center of the whole existence. It is not my self or your self, it is simply THE self. It is universal, it is not personal.\nAnd still every individual is different, every individual is unique. This is one of the most paradoxical things, but it is so.\nAll waves are part of the same ocean. And still each single wave taken, thought about, meditated over, is totally different from any other wave that has ever been, is, or will ever be. Both are true. Each wave is nothing but part of the ocean, the same ocean: the ocean is the supreme self. But the wave has a form. One wave is so tidal and is trying to reach the stars; another is so small, so humble. They are different: their shape, their form, their manifestation, is different. No two waves are the same, and still the ocean behind each wave is the same. So I don’t see that there is any difficulty in understanding this simple truth, although it is paradoxical.\nThe self is one. And still the selves are all different. Self with a capital ‘S’ is one; selves with a lower-case ‘s’ are millions. And they are all different – they are waves. God creates out of the same stuff, but each time he paints differently, he sculpts differently.\nI have heard:\nAn American art dealer traveling in China saw a beautiful hand-carved chair in an artisan’s shop and was enchanted with it. He asked the artisan how much he would charge to make eleven additional chairs.\n“All different?” said the artisan. “No, all exactly like this one.”\n“Well,” said the artisan dubiously, “If they must all be exactly alike, I will have to charge you more for each chair.”\n“More!” exclaimed the American, who had hoped for a better price on a quantity order. “Why more?”\n“I would become bored making them all alike,” replied the artisan. “I would be happier making each one different.”\nGod would have really become bored if he was to go on producing the same type of people again and again. God is not an assembly line. The production is not mass; it is always unique, whatsoever is created. You cannot find two pebbles alike on the whole of the earth, not even two leaves alike. What to say about two human beings?\nBut the stuff is the same: it is the same universal consciousness out of which we are all made, sculptured, painted. It is the same, but still each one is given a different form. And the world is beautiful because each individual has a uniqueness – his own face, his own authenticity. Yet go deeper in him, and you will find the individual disappearing. And when you have reached to his very core, there is no individual left, but only the universal.\nSo let me say it in this way: on the circumference we are different, at the center we are the same. The center is one, the circumference is millions. And each circumference has its own way of expression, of being.\nGod is a creator, not a producer. And his creativity is infinite. He never duplicates, he never imitates, he never creates carbon copies. He creates each individual only once – and that is your grandeur, your dignity, your glory.\nMitchley, you ask me: IF THE SELF IS THE SAME IN ALL MEN, DOES THIS MEAN THAT ALL MEN ARE IDENTICAL?\nThey are not identical. On the circumference they are absolutely unique. At the center there is no question of identity: it is one. There are not two, so how can they be identical? At the center there is only one universal existence; there is no question of being identical with anything else – there IS nothing else. On the periphery, on the circumference, there is no question of being identical: all waves are different, no two waves are similar.\nAnd you ask: IF SO, HOW CAN ANY ONE MAN BE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF CREATION?\nEach single wave is an essential part of the ocean; it is not accidental. By essential I mean it is needed by the ocean, otherwise it would not have been there in the first place. God needs you the way you are, he needs you exactly the way you are. So please don’t try to become somebody else.\nDon’t try to become a Buddha, don’t try to become a Jesus, don’t try to become a Mohammed. Just be yourself, because that’s how he wants you. If he had wanted Mohammeds he would have created many more Mohammeds; he does not want them. He is finished with Mohammed, Buddha, Jesus – whomsoever he has created, he is finished with them. Now he has created you. YOU are needed – not Mohammed, not Krishna, not Christ. You are needed, you are you are.\nSo don’t try to imitate any great ideal, don’t try to be a copy of somebody else. Be sincere to the form that God has given to you, because that is the only way to thank God, to be grateful to God. Be authentically your individual being.\nAnd if you are an authentic individual being you will be able to know the universal too, and more easily, because the universal is not far away from the authentic individual. The ocean is just there in the wave: a look inwards, and the ocean is revealed.\nBut if you have become false, you cannot look inwards. The mask cannot look inwards. The false cannot look inwards, because the false has nothing like an inner side. Only the real has two sides, the outer and the inner. The false has only one side, the outer. It has no inner side; it is just a mask, there is nothing inside it. It is just a painted face.\nPlease don’t be Hindus, don’t be Mohammedans, don’t be Christians. Be religious – and by being religious, I mean look inwards, search inwards. And you will find these two things: first, your authenticity, your individuality, and in the second step you will find your universality. First the small self has to be true, then you will find the supreme self.\nFrom the small truth to the ultimate truth: that is the journey, the pilgrimage.\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3\nI BEGIN TO SEE MORE CLEARLY THE GAMES THAT I AND OTHER PEOPLE PLAY. ARE THESE OBSERVATIONS TO BE TRUSTED, OR AM I WASTING TIME ON MIND GAMES AGAIN?\nPrem Tusheer, trust only the pure consciousness when there is nothing left to be observed. If something is left to be observed, it is still a game. It is the same game, played with the new toys.\nYou say: I BEGIN TO SEE MORE CLEARLY THE GAMES THAT I AND OTHER PEOPLE PLAY.\nNow, if you don’t become alert, you may start playing this game of observation. And you will be continuously observing.\nI have heard about a psychoanalyst who went to see a beauty contest. Naked beautiful women were passing: the whole audience was excited, everybody was totally absorbed in watching the beautiful women. But the psychiatrist, the psychoanalyst, was watching people.\nHis friend who was sitting by his side asked him, “What are you doing? The women are there on the stage, why don’t you look there?”\nHe said, “I am looking at the people. I am watching how they are reacting, what is in their eyes.”\nNow, this is the same game again. A few people are watching the naked women, and somebody is watching the people watching the naked women. Now the game has gone a little deeper. And there may be a third person who can watch this psychoanalyst watching people watching naked women... and so on, so forth, it can go on and on.\nObservation is good, but don’t let it become a game. It CAN become a game, and then it is all the same; what game you are playing is not the question. You can play religious games, you can play psychological games, you can play spiritual games – you can go on playing.\nThe worldly person is after money: he is playing a game. The otherworldly person is after renouncing money: he is playing another game. The worldly person is interested in being a great success, famous, well known. The religious person is escaping to the caves, so nobody knows him, so he becomes absolutely anonymous.\nBut whether you want to be known by others, or you want NOT to be known by others, you are focused on others: it is the same game.\nA man triumphantly walked into his favorite bar after asking for and receiving a quite substantial raise in salary at his job. “Joe!” he shouted to the bartender. “Drinks for the whole house are on me, except for that Jew over there in the corner. Don’t give him a drop!”\nThe Jewish man, although a little hurt, remained quiet.\nA short while later, the man cried out to the bartender again, “Joe, another drink for everybody here! But nothing for that Jew over there in the corner. I don’t want him to have anything!”\nAt this, the Jew could contain himself no longer and with great frustration he walked over to the man. “What is it?” he yelled. “What have we Jews ever done to you? Why do you treat me this way?”\nWith great contempt the man looked at the Jew and said, “You sunk the Titanic, that’s what you did!”\n“What!” cried the Jew in utter disbelief. “What kind of nonsense is this? An iceberg sank the Titanic, you fool!”\nThe man nodded his head knowingly and replied, “That’s right – Steinberg, Greenberg, Iceberg, you are all the same to me!”\nAll the games are the same. Play – but remember, all the games are the same. One has to come to a point where there is nothing left to observe, no content in the consciousness. Contentless consciousness is meditation.\nAnd when there is no content, all games disappear, because you cannot play with nothingness. There is no way to play with nothingness. When all games have disappeared, all contents have disappeared, you will be surprised to know, you will have also disappeared with your games – because the ‘I’ exists only through games. You can change your games: the ‘I’, the ego, starts riding on other games.\nWhen all games disappear – the game of observation included, the spiritual game included – when there is no content, and consciousness is there, just pure, with nothing to cling to, with nothing to hold on to, that is the moment when you go beyond games, beyond the world.\nThe world consists of games. Nirvana consists in going beyond all games. The fourth question:\nQuestion 4\nIS THERE NOT SOMETHING LIKE A DEEP INBUILT LONGING IN MAN TO DIE AS AN EGO, TO DISAPPEAR, TO DISSOLVE – AND HOW IS THIS LONGING DIFFERENT FROM FREUD’S THANATOS, FROM LIFE-NEGATION?\nSona, in reality, there is no ego to disappear. Disappearance is possible only if the ego is real. If the ego really exists, only then is disappearance possible. Then what is meant when it is said, “Let the ego disappear?” All that is meant is this? “Look deep down, and you will not find any ego in you.” That is the disappearance. It is not that the ego disappears – it has never been there in the first place. You only believed that it was there; it was just a notion, an idea in you, nothing else.\nIt is as if it is evening and the sun has set and the night is descending and you see a rope, but it looks like a snake to you. Out of your fear you project a snake on the rope, and you start running, you are so frightened. There is no snake. If somebody catches hold of you, laughs, takes you to\nthe rope, shows you that there is only a rope and nothing else, will you say that now the snake has disappeared, dissolved, gone away, died? That will be nonsense. You will also laugh; you will say the snake was never there in the first place. The rope was always a rope: you projected a snake on it. That snake was just a fear ripple in you.\nSo is the ego. Ego is just an idea, and if you start trying to drop the ego you will be in great difficulty. It cannot be dropped. How can you drop something which doesn’t exist?\nThat’s why people who try to drop the ego are in such an absurd situation: they go on dropping it and it goes on bubbling up, popping up. They become very humble, but deep down in their humbleness there is ego. Humbleness itself becomes the cause of their ego. They start proclaiming to the world: “There is nobody more humble than me, I am the tops.” Now humbleness has become another form of the ego.\nThe ego cannot be dropped, the ego can only be looked into. Once you look into it, it is not found, because it is not there. It disappears like a dream disappears when you wake up in the morning. You can wake up, that’s all; the ego cannot be dissolved. And the whole effort is absurd, because in dissolving it you have accepted its existence – and the whole fault lies there.\nSona, you ask: IS THERE NOT SOMETHING LIKE A DEEP INBUILT LONGING IN MAN TO DIE AS AN EGO?\nNo, there is none, because the ego is not there. Yes, there is a deep inbuilt longing in man to know, “Who am I?” – that is there, but not to die as an ego. There is a great urge in man to know, “Who am I?” It persists, it permeates your whole life.\nEven small children start asking, “Who am I?” The question is something very fundamental. It is an inbuilt phenomenon, the inquiry into one’s own being. And when you inquire deeply into your own being, the ego is not found. What is found is God. When you go in, the ego is not found, God is found. When you go out, God is not found, and you go on believing in the ego.\nThe ego is a belief of an outgoing consciousness, non-ego is the experience of an ingoing consciousness. It has nothing to do with Freud’s THANATOS; that’s a totally different phenomenon. Man has a lust for life, that is EROS. But when this lust for life gets frustrated again and again, it is replaced by its antagonist, by its diametrical opposite.\nJust as love can become sour and can turn into hate, the lust for life can become a lust for death. You will be surprised to know that in poor countries very few people commit suicide. Logically it should be just otherwise: poor people should commit suicide more, there is nothing in their life to live for. But rich people commit suicide more. What is the secret of this illogical phenomenon? The richer a society becomes, the more people commit suicide; more and more people commit suicide – why? The lust for life goes sour.\nThe poor man has not even lived – how can he be frustrated with life? Frustration is possible only when you have lived and seen that there is nothing in it. The poor man still hopes: he hopes for tomorrow, he still hopes for life.\nThe rich man knows everything about life; he has seen it, he has lived it. He has looked all around, he has searched everywhere, and it has not been found. In tremendous frustration, the EROS, the life-instinct, turns suicidal. The rich man wants to die, because there is no point in living, because there is no hope any more. He has all that the world can give, and still it is meaningless. So why go on prolonging it unnecessarily?\nThe biggest problem that the future is going to face is suicide. Science will make the earth richer and richer, and more and more people will be committing suicide, because they will see, “Now what is the point of going on living the same life again and again? There is nothing that can fulfill one here: why not finish it?”\nIn the rich countries, in the rich cultures, it is always a very significant question: What is the meaning of life? But in a poor country nobody asks what the meaning of life is; people ask for material things. The meaning of life is the last question: when you have known life, you can ask it.\nIn the West, people are asking about the meaning of life, and turning East. And people in the East are turning West, because they want more technology, better houses, better food, better roads, better cars; they want all that has become available in the West. The East is turning communist, the West is turning religious. The East is turning more and more materialist – why? Because in the East, eros is unfulfilled, so thanatos, the death-wish, cannot yet take possession.\nIn the West, eros has come to a saturation point. It has touched the highest peak; now there is no further to go. The circle is turning back, the wheel is turning back: it will turn into thanatos.\nIn fact the preparation for a third world war is nothing but preparation for a universal suicide. So much energy, so much technology, so much intelligence is poured just preparing for a third world war which will destroy all life on earth – not only human life, but ALL life. Why is there so much passion for war? It is just a vicarious way to commit suicide.\nThanatos is eros gone sour. Unless your eros can be again revived, unless your eros can be turned inwards, unless something that has nothing to do with material things, something of the ultimate, enters your life and becomes your inquiry, eros is bound to turn into thanatos. But it is not a necessary phenomenon. When your eros is dying, you can take a jump to an new quality of eros.\nJesus says, “Come to me, I will show you the path of life abundant, life eternal.” And that has been the teaching of all the great masters of the world. “You are finished with this life? Good,” they say. “No need to turn sour. We will show you the way to eternal life which never turns sour because it is eternal and infinite. You can go on and on and on for ever, and there are always surprises.\nThat’s what religion is all about: the search for an eros which never turns into a thanatos. Real religion is always life-affirmative: it affirms the life of the earth, and when it is found that that life is no more fulfilling to somebody, it opens the doors to divine life. If those doors remain closed then there is a problem; then your energy will start turning into its very opposite.\nEnergy can always turn into its very opposite. Love can become hate, anger can become compassion, greed can become sharing, friendship can become enmity, and vice versa. Energies can always turn into their diametrically opposite, because all energy is a dialectical process. The thesis can turn into its antithesis.\nYou love a person and then you feel unfulfilled: you start hating the person. Marriage can turn into a divorce; only marriage can turn into a divorce. If you really want no divorces in the world, let marriage disappear and there will be no divorces. How can there be a divorce if there is no marriage?\nWhenever you long for something with great expectation, and the expectation gets frustrated, there is a crisis. And two are the alternatives: either your energy will turn to its opposite, or your energy will take a quantum leap, and will change its plane – will move onto another plane.\nLive the earthly life totally. And when you see that now it no longer fulfills you, then take a jump, a quantum leap, into unearthly life. Live the extrovert life to the full, and when you see that now you have matured, graduated from it, then turn inwards.\nThis is my whole process. And the moment of crisis is the greatest moment. In the moment of crisis you need somebody to guide you: you need a master. The psychotherapist cannot help you; he can only help you to get readjusted to your old life with which you are feeling frustrated. He may manage for a few months, a few years, again the same thing will happen.\nOnly a master can help you towards a quantum leap, a jump from a lower plane to a higher plane. And there is no end: there are higher and higher planes, peaks and peaks beyond peaks waiting for you. When you have climbed one peak, you are surprised: there is another peak challenging you.\nThis is the eternity of life. The fifth question:\nBELOVED MASTER,\nQuestion 5\nHOW DO YOU KNOW THE INNER WORLD OF A PERSON? BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE MOMENT YOU SEE SOMEBODY, INSTANTLY HIS WHOLE LIFE IS REVEALED TO YOU. THIS IS MY OWN EXPERIENCE TOO.\nThere is not much mystery in it, it is very simple. If YOU are a mirror, if you are silent, if there is no turmoil within you, if there is no thought process and traffic of the mind inside you, the other is simply reflected. It is not a great secret.\nIf you go to the lake and there are no ripples and waves on the lake, you are reflected in the lake, the moon and the stars are reflected in the lake. The lake knows no art; it is not an art anyway, it is a simple phenomenon.\nI am sitting here silently, with no traffic of the mind. You come in front of me, the mirror reflects you. The lake of my consciousness reflects you: I see you, all and all, from one end to another end, in your totality. But this knowing is not knowledge, this knowing is just mirroring. It is as simple as this.…\nDonald Crowe stopped his camper truck along the Yellowstone National Park road. “A bear!” shouted Donald with delight.\nHis wife cautioned him, “Dear, the signs say, ‘Do not feed the bears’!” “A sandwich or two isn’t going to hurt the bear.”\nDonald jumped out of the camper and neared the bear with a sandwich in his right hand. He then tossed the sandwich which the bear caught and downed in one gulp. Finally he gave the bear his second sandwich.\nSuddenly the bear growled ferociously. He wanted the third sandwich which Donald didn’t have. Donald turned his pocket inside out to show he had no more food. “No more. See? I’ve given you all my sandwiches.”\nThe bear began to rush towards Donald. Donald ran for his life. As he breathlessly tore the camper door open, Donald gasped, “That bear just doesn’t understand English!”\nThere is no need to understand your language, there is no need to understand anything about you. There is no need to understand you at all: you are simply reflected. A bear is a bear. How do you know that a bear is a bear? How do you know that a rose is a rose? There is no analysis involved in it, no technique, no technology.\nThey tell the story of the psychiatrist who had a plane to catch and who still had three women in his waiting-room together with their children. So he decided to treat them all at once.\nHe walked up to the first lady who was obviously very heavy and fat and said to her, “Madam, it’s plain to see that your problem involves food, that is all you ever think of. What is your child’s name?”\n“Honey,” replied the woman.\n“You see, you even were subconsciously thinking of food when you named your child. My advice for you is to go home and stop thinking of food.”\nThe next woman he approached was dressed up with jewelry and very expensive clothes. “Madam, it is plain to see that your priorities deal with the material things of life and that money is your god. What is your child’s name?”\n“Goldie,” she replied.\n“You see, even subconsciously you were thinking of wealth when you named your child. My advice is to go home and forget about material things.”\nAs he approached the third women she got up, grabbed her son and in a loud voice said, “Come on, Dick, we’d better go home now.”\nThings are very simple. You just have to be a mirror, and people reveal everything themselves. You need not even ask a single question. The way they walk, the way they sit, the way they look, the way they talk, reveals everything. It is not revealed to you, because you are not looking at them at all. You are so preoccupied in yourself, you are so preoccupied with your thoughts, that you are surrounded by a fog.\nOtherwise, everybody is revealing everything. Everybody is naked. You just need open eyes, a silent mind, and you will be surprised: nobody can hide anything from you, there is no way of hiding anything.\nThe sixth question:\nQuestion 6\nPLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT INTELLIGENCE IS.\nPatrick Coughlan, intelligence is just an openness of being – capacity to see without prejudice, capacity to listen without interference, capacity to be with things without any a priori ideas about them – that’s what intelligence is. Intelligence is an openness of being.\nThat’s why it is so utterly different from intellectuality. Intellectuality is just the opposite of intelligence. The intellectual person is constantly carrying prejudices, information, a prioris, beliefs, knowledge. He cannot listen; before you have said anything, he has already concluded. Whatsoever you say has to pass through so many thoughts in his mind that by the time it reaches him it is something totally different. Great distortion happens in him, and he is very closed, almost blind and deaf.\nAll experts, knowledgeable people, are blind. Do you know the old story of the five blind people going to see an elephant?\nA teacher was telling her students, small girls and boys, the old ancient fable. She told the whole story, then she asked a small boy, “Can you tell me who the people were who went to see the elephant and then started quarreling?” She wanted to know whether the boy had heard while she was teaching the story.\nAnd the boy stood up and said, “Yes, I know. They were the experts.”\nShe was thinking he would answer, “They were five blind people.” But the small boy said, “Those were the experts.” He is far more right; yes, they were experts.\nAll experts are blind. Expertise means you become blind to everything else. You know more and more about less and less, and then one day you arrive at the ultimate goal of knowing all about nothing. Then you are completely closed and not even a window is open; then you have become windowless.\nThis is unintelligence. Intelligence is to be open to wind, rain and sun, to be open to all. Not to carry the past is intelligence, to die to the past every moment is intelligence, to remain fresh and innocent is intelligence.\nDonald was driving his sports car down the main avenue when suddenly he noticed to his rear a flashing red light. It was a police car.\nQuickly Donald pulled over to the side. “Officer,” he blurted, “I was only doing twenty-five in a thirty- five-mile zone.”\n“Sir,” said the officer, “I just...”\n“Furthermore,” interrupted Donald indignantly, “as a citizen I resent being frightened like this!” “Please,” continued the officer, “calm down, relax...”\n“Relax!” shouted Donald, overwrought. “You’re going to give me a traffic ticket, and you want me to relax!”\n“Mister,” pleaded the officer, “give me a chance to talk. I am NOT giving you a ticket.” “No?” said Donald, astonished.\n“I just wanted to inform you that your right rear tire is flat.”\nBut nobody is ready to listen to what the other is saying. Have you ever listened to what the other is saying? Before a word is uttered, you have already concluded. Your conclusions have become fixed; you are no more liquid.\nTo become frozen is to become idiotic, to remain liquid is to remain intelligent. Intelligence is always flowing like a river. Unintelligence is like an ice cube, frozen. Unintelligence is always consistent, because it is frozen; it is definite, it is certain. Intelligence is inconsistent, it is flowing, it has no definition, it goes on moving according to situations; it is responsible, but it is not consistent.\nOnly stupid people are consistent people. The more intelligent you are, the more inconsistent you will be – because who knows about tomorrow? Tomorrow will bring its own experiences. How can you be consistent with your yesterdays? If you are dead you will be consistent. If you are alive you HAVE to be inconsistent: you have grown, the world has changed, the river is flowing into new territory.\nYesterday the river was passing through a desert, today it is passing through a forest; it is totally different. Yesterday’s experience should not become your definition for ever, otherwise you died yesterday. One should be able to go on moving with time. One should remain a process, one should never become a thing. That is intelligence.\nThe seventh question:\nQuestion 7\nIN A LECTURE YOU SAID THAT THE REALLY AWARE WERE ABLE TO LIVE ALONE. HOW DOES THIS FIT WITH THE DREAM OF A COMMUNITY?\nSitaro, the really aware person is certainly one who is capable of living alone. But that is only half the truth. The other half is that the one who is really capable of being alone is also capable of being together with somebody In fact only he is capable of being in togetherness.\nThe person who is not able to be alone cannot be together with somebody, because he has no individuality. The person who has no individuality cannot be together with somebody – why? There\nare many problems. First, he is always afraid that if he comes too close to the other person he will lose himself. He has no integrity yet: he is afraid.\nThat’s why people are afraid of love, of too much love. People are afraid to come too close, because if they come too close they may dissolve in the other. That is the fear. The other may overpower them, the other may become their whole reality. They may be possessed by the other – that is the fear.\nOnly a person who knows the beauty of being alone is capable of coming as close as possible, because he is unafraid. He knows that he IS, he has an integrated being in him. He has something crystallized in him, because without that crystallized something he would not be able to be alone.\nThe second thing: when a person is not capable of being alone he is always dependent on the other. He clings – because he is afraid the other may leave, and then he will have to suffer loneliness. He clings, he exploits the other, he creates all kinds of bondages around the other.\nAnd whenever you make the other your possession, you become the possession of the other. It functions in both ways. When you reduce the other to a slave, the other reduces you to a slave. And when you are so afraid of the other’s leaving you, you are ready to compromise; you are ready to compromise in any way.\nYou will see this happening to all husbands and wives. They have compromised, they have sold their souls, for a single reason: because they cannot be alone. They are afraid the woman may leave, the man may leave – and then? They very idea is so frightening, scary.\nThe capacity to be alone is the capacity to love. It may look paradoxical to you, but it is not. It is an existential truth: only those people who are capable of being alone are capable of love, of sharing, of going into the deepest core of the other person – without possessing the other, without becoming dependent on the other, without reducing the other to a thing, and without becoming addicted to the other. They allow the other absolute freedom, because they know that if the other leaves, they will be as happy as they are now. Their happiness cannot be taken by the other, because it is not give by the other.\nThen why do they want to be together? It is no longer a need, it is a luxury. Try to understand it. Real persons love each other as a luxury; it is not a need. They enjoy sharing: they have so much joy, they would like to pour it into somebody. And they know how to play their life as a solo instrument.\nThe solo flute player knows how to enjoy his flute alone. And if he comes and finds a tabla player, a solo tabla player, they both will enjoy being together and creating a harmony between the flute and the tabla. They both will enjoy it: they will both pour their richnesses into each other.\nAnd, Sitaro, you ask: HOW DOES THIS FIT WITH THE DREAM OF A COMMUNITY?\nThat is the difference between the so-called society and a commune. The society consists of people who are needful, who are all dependent in some way or other. The children are dependent on the parents – but remember, the parents are also dependent on the children. It may not be so obvious, but it is so – just search a little more. The mother cannot be without the child; of course the child cannot be without the mother, but the mother also cannot be without the child.\nFamily members are dependent on each other, they cling to each other. It gives a certain comfort, security, safety. Then the family depends on other families. People depend on the church, people depend on clubs, people depend on societies. It is a great world of dependent people, childish ungrownups.\nA commune is a totally different world. It is not a society. A commune is a gathering of people who are all capable of being alone, and they would like to be together to create a great orchestra of being. A commune is not a dependent phenomenon, it is an independence.\nThat’s why many times in this ashram people come and tell me, “Everybody here seems to be so happy with himself that it looks as if nobody is interested in anybody else.” Particularly the newcomers feel it, that it is as if people are indifferent. It is not so; they are not indifferent. But you are coming from a society where everybody is dependent on everybody else. This is not a society – not like your old society. Here, everybody is enjoying HIS being, and nobody interferes in anybody’s life, there is no interference.\nMy whole effort is to make you so alert, so loving, that you don’t interfere. Love never interferes, love gives total freedom. If it is not giving freedom, then it is not love. It is not indifference that newcomers feel – and, slowly slowly, they understand. By the time they have lived here for a few weeks, they know what is happening. People are not indifferent, people are very loving. But they are non-interfering, so they don’t impinge upon you. And they are non-needy, they are not greedy, they don’t cling to you.\nOf course, you have known only that kind of people, so this new type frightens you. You think that you are not needed, that nobody cares, that these people are very selfish, that they are too self- occupied. It is nothing like that; that is not the case at all, it is absolutely untrue. But to you it may appear so in the beginning.\nA commune of sannyasins will be a celebration, a gathering of people who are not in any way needy of the other. It is beautiful if two persons are together; it is good if it continues and they can sing a song together, it is good to sing a chorus. But if things go wrong, if it becomes heavy, if being together interferes with your freedom, then you can go and sing your song alone. There is no need to be part of a chorus.\nAnd the commune is a space where this much freedom is allowed. There will be couples, but there will not be husbands and wives. There will be FRIENDS in the commune.\nThat’s why the Indian government, the Indian society, is very much afraid of me, because I am going to create a totally different kind of community which will shatter all their ideas – their so-called morality, and their traditionally cherished ideals of marriage, and all that nonsense.\nPeople can live together if they enjoy being together, but only just for that joy of being together – it is not a need. If at any moment a person decides to get out of a relationship, he can get out of it without any trouble, without any turmoil, without any crying and weeping and fighting and making things ugly, without any nagging and prolonging.\nPeople have to be true. If they feel good being together, good. If they feel it is no longer “growthful,” it is no longer maturing, they say goodbye to each other. They feel grateful to each other: whatsoever\nhas been shared was beautiful, they will cherish the memory for ever, but now the time has come to depart. They lived in joy, they will depart in joy; their friendship will remain intact. And it may happen again: they may start living together again. They will not leave any scars on each other, they will not wound each other, they will respect the other’s freedom.\nMy commune particularly – and whatsoever I am saying, I am saying about my commune – my commune will create individuals who are capable of being alone and who are also capable of being together – who can play solo music and who can become part of a chorus.\nThe last question:\nQuestion 8\nI HAVE BEEN A HINDU MONK FOR SEVEN YEARS. I HAD BEEN TOLD TO BE A CELIBATE, SO I FORCED IT UPON MYSELF. IT WAS VERY ARDUOUS BUT SOMEHOW I SUCCEEDED, AT LEAST PHYSICALLY, IN IT. BUT THEN THE WHOLE THING WENT INTO MY HEAD. NOW I CONSTANTLY THINK OF SEX AND NOTHING ELSE. I AM IMPRISONED IN IT, AND WHENEVER I SEE A WOMAN I START TREMBLING INSIDE.\nBELOVED MASTER, PLEASE HELP ME TO COME OUT OF IT.\nIt is natural. This is not the way to get beyond sex. Repression is never the way; repression really makes things more complicated. Sex is simple. Repression makes it very complicated, because repression shifts the whole sexual energy from the genital organs to the head. And when sex has entered into the head, it is an ugly phenomenon. It is not sex, it is sexuality. It is pornography.\nWhen sex has entered into your head you are creating your own private pornographic blue films.\nThat’s why you are afraid of a woman. The moment you see a woman, fear arises, because all that you have repressed is there like a volcano, and you are sitting on top of it. It can explode. The woman can be the triggering point; she may be like a spark, and you may explode.\nYou have become very inflammable, you are carrying a great dangerous energy. Sex is beautiful, lived naturally; repressed, it becomes ugly and moves into the head. And when sex moves into the head, there is no way of getting out of it. You can get out of it only by going through it: the way out is THROUGH.\nYou are fortunate that you have come here, otherwise your Hindu monkhood would have destroyed you totally. All monks become sexual, more sexual than ordinary people. Their whole thinking centers around sexuality. And remember, whenever some energy moves from its natural center to some other center, then things are very difficult. First your energy has to be brought back to the sex center.\nThat’s the whole process of Tantra. Your energy has to be brought to the natural center where it belongs. From the unnatural center there is no possibility of release.\nBut this happens: when you repress something where will it go? Only your head has some empty space, only in your skull is there emptiness. So whatsoever you repress is bound to go, slowly\nslowly, to the head. The pressure will be felt only as a tension in the head. And the more it is there, the only way that will be suggested by your so-called teachers – Muktanandas, et cetera – will be: Repress it more.\nAnd they will give you methods to repress it more: go on a fast, stand on your head... It will go more into the head if you stand on your head! Even gravitation will pull you towards your head. And you will get into more and more difficulty.\nIt was an exciting moment: the two friends’ wives were going to give birth on the same day and at the same hospital. The doctors came and told the first man, who was Jewish, that he had a new baby son and that there were no complications.\nWithin minutes the doctor came again, telling the second man that he too had a new baby boy, but the boy had a skin problem around his neck and they would need to do a skin graft.\nThe first man asked the doctor, “Tell me, would the skin from my son’s circumcision be helpful?” The doctors thought it a great idea and the graft was performed and things turned out beautifully – not even a scar.\nHaving moved to separate cities, the two friends hadn’t seen each other for over eighteen years when they met at a restaurant while each was vacationing in Miami Beach. Enthusiastically they exchanged stories. Finally, the Jewish man asked, “Have there been any problems with your son’s neck?”\n“Nothing to speak of,” said the other. “With the exception of one mysterious thing – even the doctors cannot figure it out. Every time my son sees a pretty girl, he gets a stiff neck.”\nNow it is very difficult! No doctor can help now, unless further surgery is done.\nYour seven years of monkhood have done it: you are getting a stiff neck! But you have come in time, we will do the surgery. Don’t be worried; we will teach you how to stand on your feet and not on your head, and we will teach you that each center has to function normally in its own way; no other center has to interfere.\nBut the head has become a substitute center. A few people go on thinking about food, a few people go on thinking about sex, a few people go on thinking about something else. And by thinking, you are not living it, by thinking you are creating a false appetite, and by thinking, it cannot be fulfilled. By thinking your hunger will not go; and by thinking, sex and your natural desire for it will not disappear, it will become accumulated. And the more accumulated it is, the more poisoned it becomes. It becomes stale energy.\nI would also like you to go beyond sex, because going beyond sex is a tremendously beautiful experience of freedom – freedom from the body, freedom from that continuous obsession. When sex really disappears, without any repression, when it disappears through meditation, for the first time it gives you the taste of total freedom. You don’t need anybody any more; you are out of the grip of biology.\nIn fact when sex has disappeared you become a man for the first time, because with sex you remain part of the animal world. But the way to go beyond is through it: you cannot bypass it, there is no shortcut.\nSo drop your monkhood, your celibacy, and drop all the nonsense that has been fed to you. Start from ABC again, because this is a NEW sannyas: this has to be a new birth. Forget all that has been conditioned into you. Seven years is a long time, and to be with the wrong people, to be with poisoners for seven years, is to be conditioned by them in a particular way. It will be difficult for you to drop it, but it has to be dropped.\nAnd if you have understood that those seven years have not helped you at all, then there is no problem. If you have understood, don’t cling to those ideas, simply drop them. Forget all about it, start again. Be a simple, ordinary human being.\nAnd if you can live naturally, in that very living, God comes as a grace. God comes through nature, never against nature. God comes through nature – and his coming transforms. When his energy descends in you, sex disappears. And when sex disappears of its own accord, it is a beautiful phenomenon, it is a benediction.\nBut live it, and live it totally – that’s the only way to go beyond it. No repression any more, no inhibition any more. Accept is as a gift of God – it is. And if you accept it, you will become ready to receive more gifts, better gifts.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9496","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/unio_mystica_vol_2/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/unio_mystica_vol_2/>Unio Mystica, Vol 2</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">6 Back to Eros</h1><div class=post-meta>45 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9496 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Unio_Mystica_Vol_2/part6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

I
EXPERIENCED A PERIOD OF EXTREME DIFFICULTY AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL I READ
YOUR BOOKS THAT I UNDERSTOOD ALL THAT WAS AND STILL IS HAPPENING.</p><p><br></p><p>I QUESTION THE NEED TO BE ATTACHED TO ANOTHER TEACHER, ALTHOUGH I
FEEL AND UNDERSTAND YOUR TEACHINGS DEEPLY. I KNOW I CANNOT GO BACK TO
BABA’S METHODS. I’M CONFUSED – CAN YOU HELP?</p><p><br></p><p>Bernadette Brown, only a disciple can be helped. And the disciple has
to become involved, committed. Without commitment there is no
possibility of any help. A tree has to be rooted in the soil, only then
can it grow. If it starts talking about not getting attached to the
earth, it will die.</p><p><br></p><p>Why are you afraid of getting attached to a new master? Do you think
you have gone beyond attachment? Is it really non-attachment? Or is it
just the attachment to the old teacher that is hindering your path?</p><p><br></p><p>You are still attached to a person to whom you think you cannot go
back. Now, this is unintelligent. Remain attached to him by all means,
if you feel you are growing there – that is intelligence.</p><p>Wherever growth is happening, wherever you are getting more and more
mature, more and more blissful, remain attached by all means.</p><p><br></p><p>But the moment growth has stopped, the moment you can see that you
are not going anywhere, or going round in circles, it is time to become
detached. Seek new soil, seek new lands, new pastures. And one has to go
on seeking till one becomes a master in one’s own right.</p><p><br></p><p>Why be afraid of the new? You are attached to yesterday’s sun, and a
new sun has risen today. And because of your attachment to yesterday’s
sun you are keeping your eyes closed! Your fear is that of betrayal. But
what can you do? It is not that you are betraying anybody, it is simply
a search for your own growth – and that is your responsibility.</p><p><br></p><p>And you will have to go on seeking, searching. On and on one has to
go, till one arrives at one’s own being. And learn from everywhere, and
don’t be so miserly. Now you want my help, but without becoming attached
to me. It is impossible; you will have to be plugged in with we.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what sannyas is all about. Unless you are plugged in, my
energy cannot flow into you. You can go on reading my books, but that is
quite a different matter. It will remain intellectual, it will never
become existential.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a totally different phenomenon when you are a sannyasin and you
listen to my words than when you are not a sannyasin and you listen to
my words. They are the same words, but the meaning is totally
different.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are in a love relationship with me, those words simply
become aflame. They have a light in them, they are luminous. They are
not ordinary words; they are words of your master, they are words coming
from a source to which you have become devoted. They are really YOUR
words – as if your own being has spoken to you. There is intimacy, there
is love. And in that love, the miracle happens.</p><p><br></p><p>It is up to you. But don’t be clever; that cleverness will not help.
To be with me means to be involved with me. You can be here, but if you
are not with me, your being here is superficial. You will remain on the
periphery, you will remain an outsider. And great secrets can only be
delivered in deep intimacy. They can be only delivered through love.</p><p><br></p><p>You say: I HAVE BEEN A DEVOTEE OF BABA MUKTANANDA...</p><p><br></p><p>It is already a “have been,” it is finished. You have learned
whatsoever you could learn from him; you have grown out of it, you have
passed that class. Now enter into a new class, enter into a new land,
explore this new country.</p><p><br></p><p>You say: AND I RAN A CENTER FOR HIM. I EXPERIENCED A PERIOD OF
EXTREME DIFFICULTY AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL I READ YOUR BOOKS THAT I
UNDERSTOOD ALL THAT WAS AND STILL IS HAPPENING.</p><p><br></p><p>If just by reading my books you have been helped, then think what is
possible if you get involved with me. Even the impossible is
possible.</p><p>And Muktananda has helped you, that’s why you are here. It is not
betraying him. He has helped in his own way; without him you would not
have been here. But now you have to go beyond. You have used the boat,
now you have to leave it behind. Don’t become too attached to the boat,
otherwise the whole journey becomes absurd. If you are too attached to
the boat you will not leave it; you will not get to the other shore, and
you will be puzzled and you will be confused.</p><p><br></p><p>Reading my books is an intellectual way of communicating with me.
Being a disciple is a non- intellectual, intuitive way of communing with
me. Reading my books, listening to my words, is from head to head.
Becoming a sannyasin is from heart to heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, a few things can be communicated through the head, through
words, but those few things are not really the heart of the matter. The
real heart of the matter can be communicated only from heart to heart.
Only in tremendous devotion, receptivity, passionate love, surrender, in
trust, does the flame jump from the master to the disciple And the flame
can jump only when you have come very close.</p><p><br></p><p>It is up to you.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask: I QUESTION THE NEED TO BE ATTACHED TO ANOTHER TEACHER.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are still attached to Muktananda, go back to him, forget all
about me. Then I am not for you. But don’t become confused, because I am
a totally different kind of man. Then you will remain attached to the
primary class, then you can go on playing the same game again and
again.</p><p><br></p><p>Muktananda is a teacher – orthodox, conventional, a puritan, part of
the status quo, traditional. I am just the opposite: I am not a teacher,
I am not teaching you any doctrine, I am not giving you any creed.</p><p><br></p><p>The word ‘creed’ is beautiful, it comes from a root CREDERE: CREDERE
means ‘to believe’. I am not giving you any belief-system, I am
destroying all belief-systems.</p><p><br></p><p>Muktananda has given you a belief-system. He is an ordinary teacher,
in the service of the society, in the service of the past, in the
service of this rotten structure, establishment. He is not a master.</p><p><br></p><p>I have seen him, I have met him: there is no fire in him. Nothing has
happened in him – or whatsoever has happened is very ordinary, can
happen to anybody. Those type of things happen in India to thousands of
people. He has no insight, he is not an enlightened person. You can
remain attached to him and you can go on playing the game, but you will
remain in a very primary state.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am not saying that he has not helped you – even a primary class
helps, otherwise nobody would ever enter into the university. But I am a
totally different kind of person, diametrically opposite. I teach you
rebellion. I am against the whole past, I am all for the present. And
the future is going to be born out of the present.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not for the establishment. My whole work here is to create a
totally different kind of humanity. The humanity that has existed up
till now is ill, abnormal, neurotic. I don’t belong to any tradition: I
am not a Hindu, not a Christian, not a Mohammedan. I am utterly finished
with the past, and I teach the same to you.</p><p>I don’t give you a doctrine, I give you an insight into reality. I
don’t give you a belief, I take all beliefs and prejudices away from
you, so that you can become a clean clear mirror and that which is can
be reflected in you.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is possible only if you come close to me. The closer you
are, the better. And by being closer I don’t mean a physical closeness,
I mean a spiritual closeness.</p><p><br></p><p>You say: I QUESTION THE NEED TO BE ATTACHED TO ANOTHER TEACHER
ALTHOUGH I FEEL AND UNDERSTAND YOUR TEACHINGS DEEPLY.</p><p><br></p><p>Now you will be in turmoil. You are creating a split in yourself.
Your heart is finished with your so-called teacher, Muktananda; just
your mind is clinging. Your heart will be with me now, and your mind
will go on clinging to the past. The mind always clings to the past. The
mind is absolutely against the present and the future; it lives, exists,
on the past, on the dead. Now you will be in a great split; your mind
will say one thing, and your heart will say another thing.</p><p><br></p><p>And my ways are so totally different from your other so-called
teachers that the rift will become bigger and bigger every day. Either
burn all my books and forget all about me – be at peace at least; you
will remain stupid but there will be peace – or be finished with your
old attachments. Then you can start growing again.</p><p><br></p><p>I can help you.</p><p><br></p><p>You say: I KNOW I CANNOT GO BACK TO BABA’S METHODS.</p><p><br></p><p>There is not much of a method to your Baba Muktananda. It is so
childish, the whole thing is so unintelligent! But there are people who
need it; there are people who can only understand a very superficial
thing. It is fortunate that you have grown out of that need. Now please
don’t go on carrying your childhood clothes with you: they won’t fit
you, they will suffocate you.</p><p><br></p><p>And your devotion is towards truth. If your devotion is towards
truth, then from wherever it comes, you have to bow down there, you have
to surrender there.</p><p><br></p><p>You say: I AM CONFUSED – CAN YOU HELP?</p><p><br></p><p>I can help. But, Bernadette Brown, can you take my help? That’s the
question. The crux of the matter is not can I help – can you take it,
can you receive it?</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas is just a gesture from your side that you are ready to
receive it. And I can give it to you only when you are ready to receive
it.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>IF THE SELF IS THE SAME IN ALL MEN, DOES THIS MEAN THAT ALL MEN ARE
IDENTICAL? IF SO, HOW CAN ANY ONE MAN BE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
CREATION?</p><p>Richard Mitchley, the supreme self is the same in all men. And not
only in all men but in all beings – men, animals, birds, trees, rocks.
The supreme self is the center of the whole existence. It is not my self
or your self, it is simply THE self. It is universal, it is not
personal.</p><p><br></p><p>And still every individual is different, every individual is unique.
This is one of the most paradoxical things, but it is so.</p><p><br></p><p>All waves are part of the same ocean. And still each single wave
taken, thought about, meditated over, is totally different from any
other wave that has ever been, is, or will ever be. Both are true. Each
wave is nothing but part of the ocean, the same ocean: the ocean is the
supreme self. But the wave has a form. One wave is so tidal and is
trying to reach the stars; another is so small, so humble. They are
different: their shape, their form, their manifestation, is different.
No two waves are the same, and still the ocean behind each wave is the
same. So I don’t see that there is any difficulty in understanding this
simple truth, although it is paradoxical.</p><p><br></p><p>The self is one. And still the selves are all different. Self with a
capital ‘S’ is one; selves with a lower-case ‘s’ are millions. And they
are all different – they are waves. God creates out of the same stuff,
but each time he paints differently, he sculpts differently.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard:</p><p><br></p><p>An American art dealer traveling in China saw a beautiful hand-carved
chair in an artisan’s shop and was enchanted with it. He asked the
artisan how much he would charge to make eleven additional chairs.</p><p><br></p><p>“All different?” said the artisan. “No, all exactly like this
one.”</p><p>“Well,” said the artisan dubiously, “If they must all be exactly
alike, I will have to charge you more for each chair.”</p><p><br></p><p>“More!” exclaimed the American, who had hoped for a better price on a
quantity order. “Why more?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I would become bored making them all alike,” replied the artisan. “I
would be happier making each one different.”</p><p><br></p><p>God would have really become bored if he was to go on producing the
same type of people again and again. God is not an assembly line. The
production is not mass; it is always unique, whatsoever is created. You
cannot find two pebbles alike on the whole of the earth, not even two
leaves alike. What to say about two human beings?</p><p><br></p><p>But the stuff is the same: it is the same universal consciousness out
of which we are all made, sculptured, painted. It is the same, but still
each one is given a different form. And the world is beautiful because
each individual has a uniqueness – his own face, his own authenticity.
Yet go deeper in him, and you will find the individual disappearing. And
when you have reached to his very core, there is no individual left, but
only the universal.</p><p>So let me say it in this way: on the circumference we are different,
at the center we are the same. The center is one, the circumference is
millions. And each circumference has its own way of expression, of
being.</p><p><br></p><p>God is a creator, not a producer. And his creativity is infinite. He
never duplicates, he never imitates, he never creates carbon copies. He
creates each individual only once – and that is your grandeur, your
dignity, your glory.</p><p><br></p><p>Mitchley, you ask me: IF THE SELF IS THE SAME IN ALL MEN, DOES THIS
MEAN THAT ALL MEN ARE IDENTICAL?</p><p><br></p><p>They are not identical. On the circumference they are absolutely
unique. At the center there is no question of identity: it is one. There
are not two, so how can they be identical? At the center there is only
one universal existence; there is no question of being identical with
anything else – there IS nothing else. On the periphery, on the
circumference, there is no question of being identical: all waves are
different, no two waves are similar.</p><p><br></p><p>And you ask: IF SO, HOW CAN ANY ONE MAN BE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
CREATION?</p><p><br></p><p>Each single wave is an essential part of the ocean; it is not
accidental. By essential I mean it is needed by the ocean, otherwise it
would not have been there in the first place. God needs you the way you
are, he needs you exactly the way you are. So please don’t try to become
somebody else.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t try to become a Buddha, don’t try to become a Jesus, don’t try
to become a Mohammed. Just be yourself, because that’s how he wants you.
If he had wanted Mohammeds he would have created many more Mohammeds; he
does not want them. He is finished with Mohammed, Buddha, Jesus –
whomsoever he has created, he is finished with them. Now he has created
you. YOU are needed – not Mohammed, not Krishna, not Christ. You are
needed, you are you are.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t try to imitate any great ideal, don’t try to be a copy of
somebody else. Be sincere to the form that God has given to you, because
that is the only way to thank God, to be grateful to God. Be
authentically your individual being.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you are an authentic individual being you will be able to know
the universal too, and more easily, because the universal is not far
away from the authentic individual. The ocean is just there in the wave:
a look inwards, and the ocean is revealed.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you have become false, you cannot look inwards. The mask
cannot look inwards. The false cannot look inwards, because the false
has nothing like an inner side. Only the real has two sides, the outer
and the inner. The false has only one side, the outer. It has no inner
side; it is just a mask, there is nothing inside it. It is just a
painted face.</p><p><br></p><p>Please don’t be Hindus, don’t be Mohammedans, don’t be Christians. Be
religious – and by being religious, I mean look inwards, search inwards.
And you will find these two things: first, your authenticity, your
individuality, and in the second step you will find your universality.
First the small self has to be true, then you will find the supreme
self.</p><p><br></p><p>From the small truth to the ultimate truth: that is the journey, the
pilgrimage.</p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>I BEGIN TO SEE MORE CLEARLY THE GAMES THAT I AND OTHER PEOPLE PLAY.
ARE THESE OBSERVATIONS TO BE TRUSTED, OR AM I WASTING TIME ON MIND GAMES
AGAIN?</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Tusheer, trust only the pure consciousness when there is nothing
left to be observed. If something is left to be observed, it is still a
game. It is the same game, played with the new toys.</p><p><br></p><p>You say: I BEGIN TO SEE MORE CLEARLY THE GAMES THAT I AND OTHER
PEOPLE PLAY.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, if you don’t become alert, you may start playing this game of
observation. And you will be continuously observing.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about a psychoanalyst who went to see a beauty contest.
Naked beautiful women were passing: the whole audience was excited,
everybody was totally absorbed in watching the beautiful women. But the
psychiatrist, the psychoanalyst, was watching people.</p><p><br></p><p>His friend who was sitting by his side asked him, “What are you
doing? The women are there on the stage, why don’t you look there?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am looking at the people. I am watching how they are
reacting, what is in their eyes.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this is the same game again. A few people are watching the naked
women, and somebody is watching the people watching the naked women. Now
the game has gone a little deeper. And there may be a third person who
can watch this psychoanalyst watching people watching naked women... and
so on, so forth, it can go on and on.</p><p><br></p><p>Observation is good, but don’t let it become a game. It CAN become a
game, and then it is all the same; what game you are playing is not the
question. You can play religious games, you can play psychological
games, you can play spiritual games – you can go on playing.</p><p><br></p><p>The worldly person is after money: he is playing a game. The
otherworldly person is after renouncing money: he is playing another
game. The worldly person is interested in being a great success, famous,
well known. The religious person is escaping to the caves, so nobody
knows him, so he becomes absolutely anonymous.</p><p><br></p><p>But whether you want to be known by others, or you want NOT to be
known by others, you are focused on others: it is the same game.</p><p><br></p><p>A man triumphantly walked into his favorite bar after asking for and
receiving a quite substantial raise in salary at his job. “Joe!” he
shouted to the bartender. “Drinks for the whole house are on me, except
for that Jew over there in the corner. Don’t give him a drop!”</p><p><br></p><p>The Jewish man, although a little hurt, remained quiet.</p><p>A short while later, the man cried out to the bartender again, “Joe,
another drink for everybody here! But nothing for that Jew over there in
the corner. I don’t want him to have anything!”</p><p><br></p><p>At this, the Jew could contain himself no longer and with great
frustration he walked over to the man. “What is it?” he yelled. “What
have we Jews ever done to you? Why do you treat me this way?”</p><p><br></p><p>With great contempt the man looked at the Jew and said, “You sunk the
Titanic, that’s what you did!”</p><p><br></p><p>“What!” cried the Jew in utter disbelief. “What kind of nonsense is
this? An iceberg sank the Titanic, you fool!”</p><p><br></p><p>The man nodded his head knowingly and replied, “That’s right –
Steinberg, Greenberg, Iceberg, you are all the same to me!”</p><p><br></p><p>All the games are the same. Play – but remember, all the games are
the same. One has to come to a point where there is nothing left to
observe, no content in the consciousness. Contentless consciousness is
meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>And when there is no content, all games disappear, because you cannot
play with nothingness. There is no way to play with nothingness. When
all games have disappeared, all contents have disappeared, you will be
surprised to know, you will have also disappeared with your games –
because the ‘I’ exists only through games. You can change your games:
the ‘I’, the ego, starts riding on other games.</p><p><br></p><p>When all games disappear – the game of observation included, the
spiritual game included – when there is no content, and consciousness is
there, just pure, with nothing to cling to, with nothing to hold on to,
that is the moment when you go beyond games, beyond the world.</p><p><br></p><p>The world consists of games. Nirvana consists in going beyond all
games. The fourth question:</p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>IS THERE NOT SOMETHING LIKE A DEEP INBUILT LONGING IN MAN TO DIE AS
AN EGO, TO DISAPPEAR, TO DISSOLVE – AND HOW IS THIS LONGING DIFFERENT
FROM FREUD’S THANATOS, FROM LIFE-NEGATION?</p><p><br></p><p>Sona, in reality, there is no ego to disappear. Disappearance is
possible only if the ego is real. If the ego really exists, only then is
disappearance possible. Then what is meant when it is said, “Let the ego
disappear?” All that is meant is this? “Look deep down, and you will not
find any ego in you.” That is the disappearance. It is not that the ego
disappears – it has never been there in the first place. You only
believed that it was there; it was just a notion, an idea in you,
nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>It is as if it is evening and the sun has set and the night is
descending and you see a rope, but it looks like a snake to you. Out of
your fear you project a snake on the rope, and you start running, you
are so frightened. There is no snake. If somebody catches hold of you,
laughs, takes you to</p><p>the rope, shows you that there is only a rope and nothing else, will
you say that now the snake has disappeared, dissolved, gone away, died?
That will be nonsense. You will also laugh; you will say the snake was
never there in the first place. The rope was always a rope: you
projected a snake on it. That snake was just a fear ripple in you.</p><p><br></p><p>So is the ego. Ego is just an idea, and if you start trying to drop
the ego you will be in great difficulty. It cannot be dropped. How can
you drop something which doesn’t exist?</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why people who try to drop the ego are in such an absurd
situation: they go on dropping it and it goes on bubbling up, popping
up. They become very humble, but deep down in their humbleness there is
ego. Humbleness itself becomes the cause of their ego. They start
proclaiming to the world: “There is nobody more humble than me, I am the
tops.” Now humbleness has become another form of the ego.</p><p><br></p><p>The ego cannot be dropped, the ego can only be looked into. Once you
look into it, it is not found, because it is not there. It disappears
like a dream disappears when you wake up in the morning. You can wake
up, that’s all; the ego cannot be dissolved. And the whole effort is
absurd, because in dissolving it you have accepted its existence – and
the whole fault lies there.</p><p><br></p><p>Sona, you ask: IS THERE NOT SOMETHING LIKE A DEEP INBUILT LONGING IN
MAN TO DIE AS AN EGO?</p><p><br></p><p>No, there is none, because the ego is not there. Yes, there is a deep
inbuilt longing in man to know, “Who am I?” – that is there, but not to
die as an ego. There is a great urge in man to know, “Who am I?” It
persists, it permeates your whole life.</p><p><br></p><p>Even small children start asking, “Who am I?” The question is
something very fundamental. It is an inbuilt phenomenon, the inquiry
into one’s own being. And when you inquire deeply into your own being,
the ego is not found. What is found is God. When you go in, the ego is
not found, God is found. When you go out, God is not found, and you go
on believing in the ego.</p><p><br></p><p>The ego is a belief of an outgoing consciousness, non-ego is the
experience of an ingoing consciousness. It has nothing to do with
Freud’s THANATOS; that’s a totally different phenomenon. Man has a lust
for life, that is EROS. But when this lust for life gets frustrated
again and again, it is replaced by its antagonist, by its diametrical
opposite.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as love can become sour and can turn into hate, the lust for
life can become a lust for death. You will be surprised to know that in
poor countries very few people commit suicide. Logically it should be
just otherwise: poor people should commit suicide more, there is nothing
in their life to live for. But rich people commit suicide more. What is
the secret of this illogical phenomenon? The richer a society becomes,
the more people commit suicide; more and more people commit suicide –
why? The lust for life goes sour.</p><p><br></p><p>The poor man has not even lived – how can he be frustrated with life?
Frustration is possible only when you have lived and seen that there is
nothing in it. The poor man still hopes: he hopes for tomorrow, he still
hopes for life.</p><p>The rich man knows everything about life; he has seen it, he has
lived it. He has looked all around, he has searched everywhere, and it
has not been found. In tremendous frustration, the EROS, the
life-instinct, turns suicidal. The rich man wants to die, because there
is no point in living, because there is no hope any more. He has all
that the world can give, and still it is meaningless. So why go on
prolonging it unnecessarily?</p><p><br></p><p>The biggest problem that the future is going to face is suicide.
Science will make the earth richer and richer, and more and more people
will be committing suicide, because they will see, “Now what is the
point of going on living the same life again and again? There is nothing
that can fulfill one here: why not finish it?”</p><p><br></p><p>In the rich countries, in the rich cultures, it is always a very
significant question: What is the meaning of life? But in a poor country
nobody asks what the meaning of life is; people ask for material things.
The meaning of life is the last question: when you have known life, you
can ask it.</p><p><br></p><p>In the West, people are asking about the meaning of life, and turning
East. And people in the East are turning West, because they want more
technology, better houses, better food, better roads, better cars; they
want all that has become available in the West. The East is turning
communist, the West is turning religious. The East is turning more and
more materialist – why? Because in the East, eros is unfulfilled, so
thanatos, the death-wish, cannot yet take possession.</p><p><br></p><p>In the West, eros has come to a saturation point. It has touched the
highest peak; now there is no further to go. The circle is turning back,
the wheel is turning back: it will turn into thanatos.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact the preparation for a third world war is nothing but
preparation for a universal suicide. So much energy, so much technology,
so much intelligence is poured just preparing for a third world war
which will destroy all life on earth – not only human life, but ALL
life. Why is there so much passion for war? It is just a vicarious way
to commit suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanatos is eros gone sour. Unless your eros can be again revived,
unless your eros can be turned inwards, unless something that has
nothing to do with material things, something of the ultimate, enters
your life and becomes your inquiry, eros is bound to turn into thanatos.
But it is not a necessary phenomenon. When your eros is dying, you can
take a jump to an new quality of eros.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says, “Come to me, I will show you the path of life abundant,
life eternal.” And that has been the teaching of all the great masters
of the world. “You are finished with this life? Good,” they say. “No
need to turn sour. We will show you the way to eternal life which never
turns sour because it is eternal and infinite. You can go on and on and
on for ever, and there are always surprises.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what religion is all about: the search for an eros which never
turns into a thanatos. Real religion is always life-affirmative: it
affirms the life of the earth, and when it is found that that life is no
more fulfilling to somebody, it opens the doors to divine life. If those
doors remain closed then there is a problem; then your energy will start
turning into its very opposite.</p><p><br></p><p>Energy can always turn into its very opposite. Love can become hate,
anger can become compassion, greed can become sharing, friendship can
become enmity, and vice versa. Energies can always turn into their
diametrically opposite, because all energy is a dialectical process. The
thesis can turn into its antithesis.</p><p>You love a person and then you feel unfulfilled: you start hating the
person. Marriage can turn into a divorce; only marriage can turn into a
divorce. If you really want no divorces in the world, let marriage
disappear and there will be no divorces. How can there be a divorce if
there is no marriage?</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you long for something with great expectation, and the
expectation gets frustrated, there is a crisis. And two are the
alternatives: either your energy will turn to its opposite, or your
energy will take a quantum leap, and will change its plane – will move
onto another plane.</p><p><br></p><p>Live the earthly life totally. And when you see that now it no longer
fulfills you, then take a jump, a quantum leap, into unearthly life.
Live the extrovert life to the full, and when you see that now you have
matured, graduated from it, then turn inwards.</p><p><br></p><p>This is my whole process. And the moment of crisis is the greatest
moment. In the moment of crisis you need somebody to guide you: you need
a master. The psychotherapist cannot help you; he can only help you to
get readjusted to your old life with which you are feeling frustrated.
He may manage for a few months, a few years, again the same thing will
happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Only a master can help you towards a quantum leap, a jump from a
lower plane to a higher plane. And there is no end: there are higher and
higher planes, peaks and peaks beyond peaks waiting for you. When you
have climbed one peak, you are surprised: there is another peak
challenging you.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the eternity of life. The fifth question:</p><p>BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5</p><p><br></p><p>HOW DO YOU KNOW THE INNER WORLD OF A PERSON? BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS
FELT THAT THE MOMENT YOU SEE SOMEBODY, INSTANTLY HIS WHOLE LIFE IS
REVEALED TO YOU. THIS IS MY OWN EXPERIENCE TOO.</p><p><br></p><p>There is not much mystery in it, it is very simple. If YOU are a
mirror, if you are silent, if there is no turmoil within you, if there
is no thought process and traffic of the mind inside you, the other is
simply reflected. It is not a great secret.</p><p><br></p><p>If you go to the lake and there are no ripples and waves on the lake,
you are reflected in the lake, the moon and the stars are reflected in
the lake. The lake knows no art; it is not an art anyway, it is a simple
phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>I am sitting here silently, with no traffic of the mind. You come in
front of me, the mirror reflects you. The lake of my consciousness
reflects you: I see you, all and all, from one end to another end, in
your totality. But this knowing is not knowledge, this knowing is just
mirroring. It is as simple as this.…</p><p><br></p><p>Donald Crowe stopped his camper truck along the Yellowstone National

in his right hand. He then tossed the sandwich which the bear caught and
downed in one gulp. Finally he gave the bear his second sandwich.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly the bear growled ferociously. He wanted the third sandwich
which Donald didn’t have. Donald turned his pocket inside out to show he
had no more food. “No more. See? I’ve given you all my sandwiches.”</p><p><br></p><p>The bear began to rush towards Donald. Donald ran for his life. As he
breathlessly tore the camper door open, Donald gasped, “That bear just
doesn’t understand English!”</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need to understand your language, there is no need to
understand anything about you. There is no need to understand you at
all: you are simply reflected. A bear is a bear. How do you know that a
bear is a bear? How do you know that a rose is a rose? There is no
analysis involved in it, no technique, no technology.</p><p><br></p><p>They tell the story of the psychiatrist who had a plane to catch and
who still had three women in his waiting-room together with their
children. So he decided to treat them all at once.</p><p><br></p><p>He walked up to the first lady who was obviously very heavy and fat
and said to her, “Madam, it’s plain to see that your problem involves
food, that is all you ever think of. What is your child’s name?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Honey,” replied the woman.</p><p><br></p><p>“You see, you even were subconsciously thinking of food when you
named your child. My advice for you is to go home and stop thinking of
food.”</p><p><br></p><p>The next woman he approached was dressed up with jewelry and very
expensive clothes. “Madam, it is plain to see that your priorities deal
with the material things of life and that money is your god. What is
your child’s name?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Goldie,” she replied.</p><p><br></p><p>“You see, even subconsciously you were thinking of wealth when you
named your child. My advice is to go home and forget about material
things.”</p><p><br></p><p>As he approached the third women she got up, grabbed her son and in a
loud voice said, “Come on, Dick, we’d better go home now.”</p><p><br></p><p>Things are very simple. You just have to be a mirror, and people
reveal everything themselves. You need not even ask a single question.
The way they walk, the way they sit, the way they look, the way they
talk, reveals everything. It is not revealed to you, because you are not
looking at them at all. You are so preoccupied in yourself, you are so
preoccupied with your thoughts, that you are surrounded by a fog.</p><p>Otherwise, everybody is revealing everything. Everybody is naked. You
just need open eyes, a silent mind, and you will be surprised: nobody
can hide anything from you, there is no way of hiding anything.</p><p><br></p><p>The sixth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 6</p><p><br></p><p>PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT INTELLIGENCE IS.</p><p><br></p><p>Patrick Coughlan, intelligence is just an openness of being –
capacity to see without prejudice, capacity to listen without
interference, capacity to be with things without any a priori ideas
about them – that’s what intelligence is. Intelligence is an openness of
being.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why it is so utterly different from intellectuality.
Intellectuality is just the opposite of intelligence. The intellectual
person is constantly carrying prejudices, information, a prioris,
beliefs, knowledge. He cannot listen; before you have said anything, he
has already concluded. Whatsoever you say has to pass through so many
thoughts in his mind that by the time it reaches him it is something
totally different. Great distortion happens in him, and he is very
closed, almost blind and deaf.</p><p><br></p><p>All experts, knowledgeable people, are blind. Do you know the old
story of the five blind people going to see an elephant?</p><p><br></p><p>A teacher was telling her students, small girls and boys, the old
ancient fable. She told the whole story, then she asked a small boy,
“Can you tell me who the people were who went to see the elephant and
then started quarreling?” She wanted to know whether the boy had heard
while she was teaching the story.</p><p><br></p><p>And the boy stood up and said, “Yes, I know. They were the
experts.”</p><p><br></p><p>She was thinking he would answer, “They were five blind people.” But
the small boy said, “Those were the experts.” He is far more right; yes,
they were experts.</p><p><br></p><p>All experts are blind. Expertise means you become blind to everything
else. You know more and more about less and less, and then one day you
arrive at the ultimate goal of knowing all about nothing. Then you are
completely closed and not even a window is open; then you have become
windowless.</p><p><br></p><p>This is unintelligence. Intelligence is to be open to wind, rain and
sun, to be open to all. Not to carry the past is intelligence, to die to
the past every moment is intelligence, to remain fresh and innocent is
intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>Donald was driving his sports car down the main avenue when suddenly
he noticed to his rear a flashing red light. It was a police car.</p><p><br></p><p>Quickly Donald pulled over to the side. “Officer,” he blurted, “I was
only doing twenty-five in a thirty- five-mile zone.”</p><p>“Sir,” said the officer, “I just...”</p><p><br></p><p>“Furthermore,” interrupted Donald indignantly, “as a citizen I resent
being frightened like this!” “Please,” continued the officer, “calm
down, relax...”</p><p>“Relax!” shouted Donald, overwrought. “You’re going to give me a
traffic ticket, and you want me to relax!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Mister,” pleaded the officer, “give me a chance to talk. I am NOT
giving you a ticket.” “No?” said Donald, astonished.</p><p>“I just wanted to inform you that your right rear tire is flat.”</p><p><br></p><p>But nobody is ready to listen to what the other is saying. Have you
ever listened to what the other is saying? Before a word is uttered, you
have already concluded. Your conclusions have become fixed; you are no
more liquid.</p><p><br></p><p>To become frozen is to become idiotic, to remain liquid is to remain
intelligent. Intelligence is always flowing like a river. Unintelligence
is like an ice cube, frozen. Unintelligence is always consistent,
because it is frozen; it is definite, it is certain. Intelligence is
inconsistent, it is flowing, it has no definition, it goes on moving
according to situations; it is responsible, but it is not
consistent.</p><p><br></p><p>Only stupid people are consistent people. The more intelligent you
are, the more inconsistent you will be – because who knows about
tomorrow? Tomorrow will bring its own experiences. How can you be
consistent with your yesterdays? If you are dead you will be consistent.
If you are alive you HAVE to be inconsistent: you have grown, the world
has changed, the river is flowing into new territory.</p><p><br></p><p>Yesterday the river was passing through a desert, today it is passing
through a forest; it is totally different. Yesterday’s experience should
not become your definition for ever, otherwise you died yesterday. One
should be able to go on moving with time. One should remain a process,
one should never become a thing. That is intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>The seventh question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 7</p><p><br></p><p>IN A LECTURE YOU SAID THAT THE REALLY AWARE WERE ABLE TO LIVE ALONE.
HOW DOES THIS FIT WITH THE DREAM OF A COMMUNITY?</p><p><br></p><p>Sitaro, the really aware person is certainly one who is capable of
living alone. But that is only half the truth. The other half is that
the one who is really capable of being alone is also capable of being
together with somebody In fact only he is capable of being in
togetherness.</p><p><br></p><p>The person who is not able to be alone cannot be together with
somebody, because he has no individuality. The person who has no
individuality cannot be together with somebody – why? There</p><p>are many problems. First, he is always afraid that if he comes too
close to the other person he will lose himself. He has no integrity yet:
he is afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why people are afraid of love, of too much love. People are
afraid to come too close, because if they come too close they may
dissolve in the other. That is the fear. The other may overpower them,
the other may become their whole reality. They may be possessed by the
other – that is the fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Only a person who knows the beauty of being alone is capable of
coming as close as possible, because he is unafraid. He knows that he
IS, he has an integrated being in him. He has something crystallized in
him, because without that crystallized something he would not be able to
be alone.</p><p><br></p><p>The second thing: when a person is not capable of being alone he is
always dependent on the other. He clings – because he is afraid the
other may leave, and then he will have to suffer loneliness. He clings,
he exploits the other, he creates all kinds of bondages around the
other.</p><p><br></p><p>And whenever you make the other your possession, you become the
possession of the other. It functions in both ways. When you reduce the
other to a slave, the other reduces you to a slave. And when you are so
afraid of the other’s leaving you, you are ready to compromise; you are
ready to compromise in any way.</p><p><br></p><p>You will see this happening to all husbands and wives. They have
compromised, they have sold their souls, for a single reason: because
they cannot be alone. They are afraid the woman may leave, the man may
leave – and then? They very idea is so frightening, scary.</p><p><br></p><p>The capacity to be alone is the capacity to love. It may look
paradoxical to you, but it is not. It is an existential truth: only
those people who are capable of being alone are capable of love, of
sharing, of going into the deepest core of the other person – without
possessing the other, without becoming dependent on the other, without
reducing the other to a thing, and without becoming addicted to the
other. They allow the other absolute freedom, because they know that if
the other leaves, they will be as happy as they are now. Their happiness
cannot be taken by the other, because it is not give by the other.</p><p><br></p><p>Then why do they want to be together? It is no longer a need, it is a
luxury. Try to understand it. Real persons love each other as a luxury;
it is not a need. They enjoy sharing: they have so much joy, they would
like to pour it into somebody. And they know how to play their life as a
solo instrument.</p><p><br></p><p>The solo flute player knows how to enjoy his flute alone. And if he
comes and finds a tabla player, a solo tabla player, they both will
enjoy being together and creating a harmony between the flute and the
tabla. They both will enjoy it: they will both pour their richnesses
into each other.</p><p><br></p><p>And, Sitaro, you ask: HOW DOES THIS FIT WITH THE DREAM OF A
COMMUNITY?</p><p><br></p><p>That is the difference between the so-called society and a commune.
The society consists of people who are needful, who are all dependent in
some way or other. The children are dependent on the parents – but
remember, the parents are also dependent on the children. It may not be
so obvious, but it is so – just search a little more. The mother cannot
be without the child; of course the child cannot be without the mother,
but the mother also cannot be without the child.</p><p>Family members are dependent on each other, they cling to each other.
It gives a certain comfort, security, safety. Then the family depends on
other families. People depend on the church, people depend on clubs,
people depend on societies. It is a great world of dependent people,
childish ungrownups.</p><p><br></p><p>A commune is a totally different world. It is not a society. A
commune is a gathering of people who are all capable of being alone, and
they would like to be together to create a great orchestra of being. A
commune is not a dependent phenomenon, it is an independence.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why many times in this ashram people come and tell me,
“Everybody here seems to be so happy with himself that it looks as if
nobody is interested in anybody else.” Particularly the newcomers feel
it, that it is as if people are indifferent. It is not so; they are not
indifferent. But you are coming from a society where everybody is
dependent on everybody else. This is not a society – not like your old
society. Here, everybody is enjoying HIS being, and nobody interferes in
anybody’s life, there is no interference.</p><p><br></p><p>My whole effort is to make you so alert, so loving, that you don’t
interfere. Love never interferes, love gives total freedom. If it is not
giving freedom, then it is not love. It is not indifference that
newcomers feel – and, slowly slowly, they understand. By the time they
have lived here for a few weeks, they know what is happening. People are
not indifferent, people are very loving. But they are non-interfering,
so they don’t impinge upon you. And they are non-needy, they are not
greedy, they don’t cling to you.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, you have known only that kind of people, so this new type
frightens you. You think that you are not needed, that nobody cares,
that these people are very selfish, that they are too self- occupied. It
is nothing like that; that is not the case at all, it is absolutely
untrue. But to you it may appear so in the beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>A commune of sannyasins will be a celebration, a gathering of people
who are not in any way needy of the other. It is beautiful if two
persons are together; it is good if it continues and they can sing a
song together, it is good to sing a chorus. But if things go wrong, if
it becomes heavy, if being together interferes with your freedom, then
you can go and sing your song alone. There is no need to be part of a
chorus.</p><p><br></p><p>And the commune is a space where this much freedom is allowed. There
will be couples, but there will not be husbands and wives. There will be
FRIENDS in the commune.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why the Indian government, the Indian society, is very much
afraid of me, because I am going to create a totally different kind of
community which will shatter all their ideas – their so-called morality,
and their traditionally cherished ideals of marriage, and all that
nonsense.</p><p><br></p><p>People can live together if they enjoy being together, but only just
for that joy of being together – it is not a need. If at any moment a
person decides to get out of a relationship, he can get out of it
without any trouble, without any turmoil, without any crying and weeping
and fighting and making things ugly, without any nagging and
prolonging.</p><p><br></p><p>People have to be true. If they feel good being together, good. If
they feel it is no longer “growthful,” it is no longer maturing, they
say goodbye to each other. They feel grateful to each other:
whatsoever</p><p>has been shared was beautiful, they will cherish the memory for ever,
but now the time has come to depart. They lived in joy, they will depart
in joy; their friendship will remain intact. And it may happen again:
they may start living together again. They will not leave any scars on
each other, they will not wound each other, they will respect the
other’s freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>My commune particularly – and whatsoever I am saying, I am saying
about my commune – my commune will create individuals who are capable of
being alone and who are also capable of being together – who can play
solo music and who can become part of a chorus.</p><p><br></p><p>The last question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 8</p><p><br></p><p>I HAVE BEEN A HINDU MONK FOR SEVEN YEARS. I HAD BEEN TOLD TO BE A
CELIBATE, SO I FORCED IT UPON MYSELF. IT WAS VERY ARDUOUS BUT SOMEHOW I
SUCCEEDED, AT LEAST PHYSICALLY, IN IT. BUT THEN THE WHOLE THING WENT
INTO MY HEAD. NOW I CONSTANTLY THINK OF SEX AND NOTHING ELSE. I AM
IMPRISONED IN IT, AND WHENEVER I SEE A WOMAN I START TREMBLING
INSIDE.</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED MASTER, PLEASE HELP ME TO COME OUT OF IT.</p><p><br></p><p>It is natural. This is not the way to get beyond sex. Repression is
never the way; repression really makes things more complicated. Sex is
simple. Repression makes it very complicated, because repression shifts
the whole sexual energy from the genital organs to the head. And when
sex has entered into the head, it is an ugly phenomenon. It is not sex,
it is sexuality. It is pornography.</p><p><br></p><p>When sex has entered into your head you are creating your own private
pornographic blue films.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why you are afraid of a woman. The moment you see a woman,
fear arises, because all that you have repressed is there like a
volcano, and you are sitting on top of it. It can explode. The woman can
be the triggering point; she may be like a spark, and you may
explode.</p><p><br></p><p>You have become very inflammable, you are carrying a great dangerous
energy. Sex is beautiful, lived naturally; repressed, it becomes ugly
and moves into the head. And when sex moves into the head, there is no
way of getting out of it. You can get out of it only by going through
it: the way out is THROUGH.</p><p><br></p><p>You are fortunate that you have come here, otherwise your Hindu
monkhood would have destroyed you totally. All monks become sexual, more
sexual than ordinary people. Their whole thinking centers around
sexuality. And remember, whenever some energy moves from its natural
center to some other center, then things are very difficult. First your
energy has to be brought back to the sex center.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s the whole process of Tantra. Your energy has to be brought to
the natural center where it belongs. From the unnatural center there is
no possibility of release.</p><p><br></p><p>But this happens: when you repress something where will it go? Only
your head has some empty space, only in your skull is there emptiness.
So whatsoever you repress is bound to go, slowly</p><p>slowly, to the head. The pressure will be felt only as a tension in
the head. And the more it is there, the only way that will be suggested
by your so-called teachers – Muktanandas, et cetera – will be: Repress
it more.</p><p><br></p><p>And they will give you methods to repress it more: go on a fast,
stand on your head... It will go more into the head if you stand on your
head! Even gravitation will pull you towards your head. And you will get
into more and more difficulty.</p><p><br></p><p>It was an exciting moment: the two friends’ wives were going to give
birth on the same day and at the same hospital. The doctors came and
told the first man, who was Jewish, that he had a new baby son and that
there were no complications.</p><p><br></p><p>Within minutes the doctor came again, telling the second man that he
too had a new baby boy, but the boy had a skin problem around his neck
and they would need to do a skin graft.</p><p><br></p><p>The first man asked the doctor, “Tell me, would the skin from my
son’s circumcision be helpful?” The doctors thought it a great idea and
the graft was performed and things turned out beautifully – not even a
scar.</p><p><br></p><p>Having moved to separate cities, the two friends hadn’t seen each
other for over eighteen years when they met at a restaurant while each
was vacationing in Miami Beach. Enthusiastically they exchanged stories.
Finally, the Jewish man asked, “Have there been any problems with your
son’s neck?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nothing to speak of,” said the other. “With the exception of one
mysterious thing – even the doctors cannot figure it out. Every time my
son sees a pretty girl, he gets a stiff neck.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now it is very difficult! No doctor can help now, unless further
surgery is done.</p><p><br></p><p>Your seven years of monkhood have done it: you are getting a stiff
neck! But you have come in time, we will do the surgery. Don’t be
worried; we will teach you how to stand on your feet and not on your
head, and we will teach you that each center has to function normally in
its own way; no other center has to interfere.</p><p><br></p><p>But the head has become a substitute center. A few people go on
thinking about food, a few people go on thinking about sex, a few people
go on thinking about something else. And by thinking, you are not living
it, by thinking you are creating a false appetite, and by thinking, it
cannot be fulfilled. By thinking your hunger will not go; and by
thinking, sex and your natural desire for it will not disappear, it will
become accumulated. And the more accumulated it is, the more poisoned it
becomes. It becomes stale energy.</p><p><br></p><p>I would also like you to go beyond sex, because going beyond sex is a
tremendously beautiful experience of freedom – freedom from the body,
freedom from that continuous obsession. When sex really disappears,
without any repression, when it disappears through meditation, for the
first time it gives you the taste of total freedom. You don’t need
anybody any more; you are out of the grip of biology.</p><p>In fact when sex has disappeared you become a man for the first time,
because with sex you remain part of the animal world. But the way to go
beyond is through it: you cannot bypass it, there is no shortcut.</p><p><br></p><p>So drop your monkhood, your celibacy, and drop all the nonsense that
has been fed to you. Start from ABC again, because this is a NEW
sannyas: this has to be a new birth. Forget all that has been
conditioned into you. Seven years is a long time, and to be with the
wrong people, to be with poisoners for seven years, is to be conditioned
by them in a particular way. It will be difficult for you to drop it,
but it has to be dropped.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you have understood that those seven years have not helped you
at all, then there is no problem. If you have understood, don’t cling to
those ideas, simply drop them. Forget all about it, start again. Be a
simple, ordinary human being.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you can live naturally, in that very living, God comes as a
grace. God comes through nature, never against nature. God comes through
nature – and his coming transforms. When his energy descends in you, sex
disappears. And when sex disappears of its own accord, it is a beautiful
phenomenon, it is a benediction.</p><p><br></p><p>But live it, and live it totally – that’s the only way to go beyond
it. No repression any more, no inhibition any more. Accept is as a gift
of God – it is. And if you accept it, you will become ready to receive
more gifts, better gifts.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

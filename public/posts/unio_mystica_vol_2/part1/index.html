It cannot be, because truth is never old. It is eternally new, it is eternally fresh, as fresh as the dewdrops in the morning or the stars in the night.\nThe claim of tradition is basically anti-truth. The word ‘tradition’ comes from a root ‘tradere’. It means ‘handed by someone to somebody else, transferred’. From ‘tradere’ also comes the word ‘trade’. Truth cannot be transferred from one person to another person. It is impossible to transfer it. It is not a thing, hence it is not transferable. It cannot be traded, nobody can give it, nobody can take it. It arises in each individual’s own being, it is a flowering of your own heart.\nHence, Sufism is not a tradition. No true religion can ever be a tradition; every true religion is bound to be a revolution, a rebellion. Sufism is one of the most profound, most authentic experiments and inquiries into truth that has happened on this earth. And Hakim Sanai, into whose sutras we will be entering again today, is one of the three greatest Sufis in the whole history of human consciousness. He makes up the trio of the three great masters, Attar, Rumi and Sanai.\nFor a few days, you will be moving again with one of the greatest souls. It is a pilgrimage, a holy pilgrimage; you will be walking on sacred ground. Be very alert, watchful, loving, open, vulnerable, then something can arise in you which can become a transformation; something can be triggered in you. But remember, it is not caused from the outside, it is not a question of cause and effect. Hence it is beyond the reach of science. Science can only understand the law of cause and effect. If something can be caused, it is bound to fall into the field of science. But truth cannot be caused.\nStill, in the presence of the master it can happen. It happens uncaused; it is a synchronicity. It is as if somebody is dancing and something is triggered in you – not caused, remember, because no dancer can cause a dance in you, but you start feeling something. You start swaying, you suddenly feel a rush of energy, you would like to dance yourself. This is synchronicity: something has happened in you, parallel but not caused.\nI will be here just like a hollow bamboo, available to Hakim Sanai so that he can sing his song and he can dance his dance. If you are open, something can start happening in you. It will not be transferred from me to you – it cannot be transferred; it will not be caused. I will not be the source of it, you will remain the source of it. But it can be triggered: I can function as a catalytic agent.\nThese few days, walking with Hakim Sanai, can be life-transforming. You will be here with one of the greatest human beings ever – a human being of the caliber of Buddha, Jesus and Mohammed.\nBut remember, the first thing, truth is not a tradition. If you believe in tradition, you will never come to know what truth is. Tradition is a belief, borrowed; it is knowledge but not experience. Tradition is scripture, philosophy, words and words – words and words about words. It is a great jungle of theories, and you can be deceived by it very easily. The mind is ready to fall into the trap of it.\nBecause truth is not a tradition, it cannot be approached through the mind. The mind is a tradition, the mind lives out of the past. The mind is always old; the mind is never original, it is never new, it is never fresh, it is never young, it is never alive. The mind is nothing but the accumulated past; all that you have known in the past has become a tape inside you. It is not the reality of this moment. The mind is a tradition.\nHence if somebody says he is a Hindu or a Christian or a Jaina or a Mohammedan is not religious. He is saying he belongs to the past, not to the present. He is saying he belongs to the mind and not to consciousness.\nConsciousness is always of the here and now: it knows no past, it knows no future. And that is the beauty of consciousness – it is meditative. The mind is a thought process, a procession of memories, imaginations, dreams, projections. Consciousness is a purity, a mirror, that simply reflects the reality as it is.\nAll belief systems have to be dropped, only then can you be a Sufi. And to be a Sufi is the greatest thing that can happen to anybody.\nNobody else except man can be deceived by words; nobody except man can be deceived at all. I have heard:\nMarilyn had a parrot for a pet, but the parrot would embarrass her whenever she came into the apartment with a man. He would shout all kinds of obscenities, always leading off with, “Somebody’s gonna get it tonight! Somebody’s gonna get it tonight!”\nIn desperation, Marilyn went to her local pet shop and explained her parrot problem to the pet shop proprietor.\n“What you need,” he said, “is a female parrot too. I don’t have one on hand, but I’ll order one. Meanwhile, you could borrow this female owl until the female parrot arrives”\nMarilyn took the owl home and put it near her parrot. It was immediately obvious that the parrot didn’t care for the owl. He glared at it.\nThat night, Marilyn wasn’t her usual nervous self as she opened the door to bring her gentleman friend in for a nightcap. Then suddenly she heard the parrot screech and she knew that things hadn’t changed.\n“Somebody’s gonna get it tonight! Somebody’s gonna get it tonight!” the parrot said. The owl said, “Whooo? Whooo?”\nAnd the parrot said, “Not you, you big-eyed son-of-a-bitch!”\nOnly man can be deceived. You cannot deceive even a parrot, but pundits can be deceived and ARE deceived. Pundits are greater parrots than parrots themselves.\nBeware. Your mind is ready to fall into any trap of words. It can create beautiful theories, philosophies; it can go on manufacturing great systems of thought – all imaginary.\nTruth has nothing to do with your imagination. Neither has truth anything to do with your inference, your guesswork. Truth is already here: truth is. All that is needed on your part is not to seek and search for it but to be available, open and empty like a mirror, so that you can reflect that which is. Truth surrounds you; truth is within and without. Only truth is. you need not go anywhere, to Kaaba or to Kashi. You need not even go outside your room, you need not even go outside your body, you need not go anywhere.\nSitting silently, doing nothing, the spring comes and the grass grows by itself. Just sitting silently in your own room, when you are empty, it is revealed.\nIt was revealed to Mohammed when he was utterly silent and empty, it was revealed to Sanai when he was silent and empty, it was revealed to Mahavira when he was silent and empty. To be empty is to be religious.\nBut you are so full of knowledge, you are so full of unnecessary luggage, your mind is so much in a constant chattering. You may call it the Veda or you may call it the Koran, it doesn’t matter. Unless you are empty, the Veda is not going to happen to you, the Koran is not going to flow through you. Unless you are empty, you will not contact truth – and truth is another name for God. I am using the word ‘truth’ so that even atheists are not offended, but truth and God are synonymous, interchangeable, they mean the same thing.\nThen what is truth if it is not a tradition? It is a revolution, it is a turning-in. Tradition looks backwards, tradition looks at others, tradition wants something to be given to you. Revolution looks inwards. Nothing has to be given to you from any source; you have already got it, it is already the case. Just turning in, just looking inside, waiting, watching, going inwards to the core of your being – and it is there.\nSufism is an inner journey. By revolution I don’t mean a political revolution. Political revolutions are not revolutions at all; they only substitute one slavery for another slavery. The only revolution there is, is religious. The only revolution there is, is turning away from tradition and turning inwards to the source of your being.\nKnowing “Who am I?” is the only revolutionary step – the first and the last, the alpha and the omega.\nThat’s the meaning of becoming a Sufi, or becoming a sannyasin. ‘Sannyasin’ is my name for the Sufi: one who is fed up with the outside world, who has known its frustrations, who has known its utter futility, who has known all the anxiety and anguish of it and is ready to dive deep within oneself to know “Who am I?” Because unless one knows oneself, all knowledge is useless.\nThe foremost, the most fundamental thing, is to become aware at the core of your being. And it is a miracle to become aware of it, because at the core of your being you are always pure, always innocent, always virgin, always celibate. At the very core of your being, you have never left the Garden of Eden, you are still in paradise.\nThat is the name of Hakim Sanai’s book: THE HADIQA. It means ‘the Garden’ – the Garden of God, paradise.\nWhere is this paradise? There are foolish people who have been searching for the Garden of Eden. A few think it was in Babylon, a few think it was on the continent of Atlantis which has gone down under the ocean – there has been a search. This is complete stupidity.\nThe Garden exists in YOU Adam has not been expelled from the Garden of Eden, he has fallen asleep. ‘The original fall’ simply means you have forgotten who you are. Adam has become knowledgeable and has lost his purity of consciousness.\nThat’s the meaning of the parable of the Tree of Knowledge. Adam has eaten from the Tree of Knowledge – that is the original sin. See the beauty of the parable: knowledge is the original sin, to become knowledgeable is to fall from grace. Then how to attain it again? Drop your knowledge, become innocent again. Be a child again, and you will be able to enter into the Garden of Eden.\nAdam becomes knowledgeable, Christ becomes innocent. Becoming knowledgeable, Adam starts moving outwards, falls victim to philosophies, belief systems, theories, words. Jesus dropped all tradition; that’s why the Jews were so angry with him. The Jews are a very traditional people, they were angry because he was a revolutionary. He was a drop-out – he simply dropped all the knowledge of all the ancient rabbis and he became innocent. But in becoming innocent he again entered that original state of Adam before he had eaten the fruit of knowledge.\nI have heard:\nTwo university professors are walking around the campus. They are well-known historians and are voicing their respective opinions about Jesus. When they are about to part, one says thoughtfully, “You know, he was really a good fellow, but he didn’t publish.”\nThe professor, the pundit, the knowledgeable person, the scholar, has no understanding about inner experiences. All that he knows is the rubbish of so-called research work, all that he knows is about words. Those words are hollow, they contain nothing, they are meaningless – because meaning arises only out of one’s own experience.\nSufism is an experiment in existential experience. It is not a philosophy; rather, think of it as a ladder. You don’t agree with or believe in a ladder; you don’t believe in it, you don’t disbelieve in it, either. You climb it, and if it breaks you get a new one. Thus to treat Sufism as a system to be believed in or committed to or attached to, is to miss the whole point. It is a ladder, not a belief system. Use it, climb it, and go beyond it. It is a boat.\nBuddha calls his system a raft: that’s exactly what Sufism is. Use it to go to the other shore, to the further shore, then forget all about it. The truth believed is a lie, the truth borrowed is a lie. My truth\ncannot be your truth; the moment my truth reaches you, it is no more the same thing. With me, in me, it had the meaning of my experience. When it goes to you, only words reach you – empty, hollow. You can cling to those words, you can believe too much in those words, and you will be lost.\nThis is something very basic to be remembered, that Sufism is a practical science, it is pragmatic. It does not depend on philosophizing, speculating and guesswork; it points directly to existential experience.\nYou can know much about love. You can go and look in the libraries, you can look in the Encyclopedia Britannica, and you will know much about love. But it will be ABOUT love – it will not be love. To know love, you will have to fall in love; there is no other way, there is no shortcut.\nTwo Italians in Rome were talking when an airplane flew overhead and one said to the other, “The pope is aboard that plane.”\n“No,” said the other, “he is in southern Italy at the summer Vatican.” “No, he is aboard that plane,” said the other.\nOne word led to another, and before long, several thousand liras were bet on whether or not the pope was aboard that plane. The two men rushed to the airport in time to observe the pope emerging from the plane.\nThe one who lost the bet turned to his friend and said, “Tell me, Tony, how could you tell, twenty thousand feet in the air, that the pope was aboard that plane?”\n“Easy,” he said. “It says so right on the outside of the airplane: TWA.” “What does that mean?”\n“Top Wop Aboard.”\nSometimes your guess may even work, but still it is never the truth. Truth has to be experienced.\nYou are guessing about God, you are arguing about God, speculating about God, fighting about God. And no time is left for experiencing him.\nBeing here with me, remember it always: we are not interested in any guesswork, we are interested in going to the real experience of it. And when the experience is possible, why bother arguing about it? Why go round and round? Why not penetrate to the very core? You can go round and round for centuries and you will never arrive anywhere. And you can arrive right now, this very moment, if you go inwards.\nAll these sutras of THE HADIQA are just preparing you to take the inner leap, the inner jump.\nSufism is an attempt to unfreeze habits of thinking, to replace them with less stiff and restricting ones. Sufism is criticizing, dissolving and stepping over all prejudices, loosening all rigid and constricting moulds of thought. Sufism is relaxing into your own self; it is a let-go.\nWhen all prejudices have been dropped, all concepts rejected, all scriptures, burnt, the whole tradition dropped, then you are innocent, you are unpolluted. In that purity of the present moment, the sun rises.\nAnd that is from where one starts growing into a real human being. It is from there that one starts growing even beyond humanity; one starts surpassing, one starts transcending ordinary human limits. Real growth knows no limit. You contain something infinite in you, something oceanic, and unless you have known it, don’t be satisfied, don’t be contented. That contentment will be suicide.\nI see millions of people: they are all dead, they have committed suicide, because they have become contented – and contented with futile things, contented with nothing.\nNever be contented unless you have known your inner being, unless you have come to the innermost shrine. Remain discontented. Sufis call it “the divine discontentment.”\nTeilhard de Chardin says, “The most real aspect of living is the passion for growth.”\nYes, be in a passionate affair with your own growth. Never allow a single day to pass without growing, otherwise you will remain a seed and you will never know the beauties of being a flower. The spring will come and go, and you will remain dead.\nMillions of people are dead. They walk, they talk, they do their job, but all that is mechanical, utterly mechanical. They are moving in a kind of sleep, they are somnambulists.\nA man took his wife to a Broadway show. During the first act intermission, he had to urinate in the worst way. He hurried to the back of the theater and searched in vain for the men’s room.\nAt last he came upon a fountain surrounded by pretty foliage. He realized that he had wandered backstage. Noting that no one was around, and in desperation, he opened his pants and pissed into the fountain.\nHe had difficulty finding his way back to the auditorium, and by the time he sat down next to his wife, the curtain was up and actors were moving about on the stage.\n“Did I miss much of the second act?” he whispered. “Miss it?” she said. “You were in it!”\nBut that is the situation. People are moving unconsciously, mechanically, unaware; they don’t know what they are doing. How can they know what they are doing? because they don’t know who they are. If you don’t know your being, you can’t be aware of your doing; it is impossible. First, one has to be aware of the being – and that is growth. Growing inwards is growth, reaching inwards is growth.\nThe sutras.\nMY FRIEND, EVERYTHING EXISTING EXISTS THROUGH HIM;\nYOUR OWN EXISTENCE IS A MERE PRETENSE. NO MORE NONSENSE! LOSE YOURSELF,\nAND THE HELL OF YOUR HEART BECOMES HEAVEN.\nLOSE YOURSELF, AND ANYTHING CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED. YOUR SELFISHNESS IS AN UNTRAINED COLT.\nFirst, remember. Hakim Sanai addresses you as “My friend.” That’s the attitude of all the great masters. The disciple thinks that the master is very very far away – and from the side of the disciple it is true, because he is fast asleep. In his sleep, the master is a faraway star.\nBut the same is not the case from the side of the master. The master knows that you may be asleep but you are a buddha, you may be asleep but you are a God. The disciple may not know that he is a God, but the master knows it. The moment he knows himself to be divine, he knows the whole existence to be divine. From the master’s side, nobody is a disciple, all are masters. A few are asleep, a few are awake; the difference is only that much. From the side of the master, it is only a question of time: tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, or who knows – even today you may become enlightened.\nThe potential is there. From the side of the seed, the flower is far away. But the flower knows that the seed contains flowers, infinite flowers. From the side of the flower, the seed is a friend.\nAnd if you find a master who does not think in those terms, then remember, know well, he is not a master yet. If he thinks that you are sinners, if he thinks that you are fallen souls, then he is not a master yet; he has not come to realize his own reality.\nBuddha is reported to have said, “The day I became enlightened, the whole existence became enlightened for me – even trees, even rocks.”\nHakim Sanai says:\nMY FRIEND, EVERYTHING EXISTING EXISTS THROUGH HIM...\nGod is the only reality – or call it truth, or nature, or Tao, or whatsoever you will. Names don’t matter. Don’t go on fighting about names; X-Y-Z, anything will do. Just remember one thing, that something is there, miraculously present, which surrounds all, which permeates all.\nSufis say: As the absolute maximum, God contains all things. In fact that is the definition of God: one who contains all. He is their enfolding and their unfolding. God is in the seed, God is in the flower – in the seed hidden, in the flower manifest. God is in the sinner and is in the saint – in the sinner asleep, in the saint awake. But all is God: God is equivalent to existence.\nChristian mystics use two words: one is COMPLICATIO, it means enfolding. God is COMPLICATIO, enfolding, and EXPLICATIO, unfolding. These are the two movements of God: enfolding and manifesting. Each seed becomes the flower, and then in its own turn the flower becomes the seed, and the circle is complete.\nJust as every night you fall asleep, and in the morning you are awake again, so is God – in nature asleep, in Buddhas awake. Just to understand it is a great liberation. Suddenly you have self-worth; suddenly you are no more a condemned being. Suddenly you are an essential part of existence; you are not accidental, you participate in God’s work in your own way. You need God, God needs you; you are not unneeded.\nIn this century, millions of people are feeling unneeded, because God has disappeared from their lives. And this is one of the most fundamental needs, to be needed. If you feel needed, you feel worthy. If you feel not needed, you feel worthless, you feel like dirt.\nThat’s why people get married, because a woman will be there who will need them. Husbands don’t like their wives to work, because then they are needed less, then they are worth less. Husbands like their wives to be constantly in need of them; that gives them worth, a feeling of importance.\nThe wife also in her own way makes the husband utterly dependent; without her he will not be able to exist. Even if she goes away for one day, the husband is at a loss. He cannot find a thing in his own house; he comes to know that without the wife it is impossible to exist. Then they both bring children into the world, and both are happy because the children need them immensely, absolutely.\nThat’s why people like children – they are helpless, they are dependent. But sooner or later, the children will go their own way. And this is one of the problems in the world: when children have gone their own way and they have settled with their own families, then old people, aged people, start feeling worthless – nobody needs them.\nNow this is a psychological truth, that once a person starts feeling he is not needed, he starts committing suicide, psychological suicide. He dies then years earlier. When he is retired from his job he starts shrinking – now he is no longer needed. He was a boss and so many people were clamoring around him; he was doing something essential for the society. That job is gone. Now if he dies, it will not make any difference, the world will continue as it is.\nChildren become grown-up, they go to live their own lives, and the old people simply feel discarded. They start dying slowly, shrinking. They were healthy when they were in their work, when they were needed they were healthy. But now suddenly something disappears; the earth underneath their feet disappears, they are no longer needed.\nWe make arbitrary needs. But the man who has the sense that “God exists, and I am needed by God,” never feels worthless – never. To the last moment, to the last breath of his life, he is functioning, serving something higher than himself. He has a context bigger than himself; in that context, meaning arises.\nMeaning is always in a certain context. A single word is meaningless; when it is arranged in a poem it has tremendous meaning: now it has a context. The color in a tube is meaningless; once it is\nspread on the canvas and becomes part of a picture that is bigger than it, it has a context, suddenly meaning arises.\nIt is reported that once a very rich man asked Pablo Picasso to make a portrait of him, Picasso said, “It will be very costly.” The man was so rich, he said, “Don’t bother about it. You need not even talk about the cost, money doesn’t matter. Make my portrait and whatsoever you demand, I will give.”\nAfter six months the portrait was ready. The rich man came, but the price that was asked was fantastic: one million dollars, just for a small canvas and a few colors! The rich man said, “Are you joking? Just for a few colors and a canvas?”\nPicasso said, “Then okay, you can take an empty canvas and a few tubes full of color and you can pay as much as you want.”\nThe rich man said, “But that is not the same.”\nPicasso aid, “That’s what I am trying to point out to you. I have created a context, I have created a gestalt, a pattern. And nobody else can create it, hence the price. It is a Picasso painting: nobody else can do it the way I have done it, it has my signature on it. The harmony of the colors, the music of the colors, the poetry of the colors – that is the thing. I am not asking the price for the colors but for something that has become expressed through the colors.”\nA real painting is not just the sum total of the colors, it is more – and that “more” is the meaning. A real life is not the sum total of what you do; unless there is something more to it, you live an inauthentic life. That “more” is God. That poetry is God, that music is God, that surrounds you and floods you.\nPeople come to me and ask, “Where is God?” It is not a question of asking “where”; God is a meaning, not a person. I cannot indicate, “There – go there, and you will find him.” God has no address, God cannot be located, it is a meaning. You have to create meaning in your life, then God is. God has to be created.\nAnd the beginning of creating God is to start becoming more and more sensitive to the existence that surrounds you. The trees, the rocks, the stars, the earth – you are surrounded by great poetry. But you remain separate, hence you go on missing it.\nMY FRIEND, EVERYTHING EXISTING EXISTS THROUGH HIM;\nYOUR OWN EXISTENCE IS A MERE PRETENSE.\nIf you live as separate, if you think, “I am separate,” if you live as an ego, then your existence is a pretense. Then your existence will remain meaningless. Then you will never know the glory and the grandeur of life; you will never know the splendors that have always been available to you but you went on missing.\nIf you exist as a separate individual, you have created a wall around yourself, you have become an island. And no man is an island, we are parts of an infinite continent: that continent is God. We are parts of an ocean. The moment you recognize it, that we are parts of an ocean, your life starts having a context bigger than you, higher than you. In that context is the beginning of meaning – and meaning is God.\nNO MORE NONSENSE! says Sanai. LOSE YOURSELF, AND THE HELL OF YOUR HEART BECOMES A HEAVEN.\nJust a single step is enough: lose yourself. Don’t exist as an ‘I’, don’t go on proclaiming yourself as an ego. Drop the ego, and suddenly, immediately, instantly, the hell of your life turns into a heaven. Misery disappears.\nMisery is a by-product of your separation. Bliss is the shadow of falling back into the unity: UNIO MYSTICA. When again you start feeling like a wave in the ocean, misery cannot exist. What is misery? The fear of death. But you can die only if you are separate, you cannot die if you are not separate.\nIf the wave thinks, “I am separate from the ocean,” it is going to die; it will remain afraid, trembling. If it knows it is part of the ocean it is not going to die. It will fall back into the source, it will come again; it will go, it will come, it will appear and disappear, but it cannot die.\nBirth is appearance, death is disappearance. But neither is birth the beginning nor is death the end: the ocean continues. To have this oceanic feeling is meditation, is prayer.\nLOSE YOURSELF, AND ANYTHING CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED.\nThen the impossible is possible, because nothing is impossible for God. We have unnecessarily become too narrow, too tiny; we have become mundane. We have lost our own heritage, we are not aware of all the beauties that we contain and of all the potential that is intrinsically present in us.\nYOUR SELFISHNESS IS AN UNTRAINED COLT.\nYour selfishness is nothing but your unawareness, your lack of discipline. Create an inner discipline, a little training in awareness, and your selfishness will disappear, because your SELF will disappear.\nAnd when there is no self left, then real Self with a capital S, the Supreme Self, arrives. You disappear as a wave, you appear as the ocean. That is liberation.\nRecognize the self – the self which is not the ego, the self which has nothing of the ego in it. Hindu mystics have called it the ATMAN. Buddha has given it a totally different name, not only different but diametrically opposite: he has called it ANATTA, no-self.\nThe self is a no-self, because there is no ego in it. To be an ego is to fall from your reality – the original sin. The self is not the ego, absolutely not; it is not personal, either. It is misleading to speak of “my self.” The self is universal. The moment you say “my self” you have lost track of the universal and you have become small. Now you will feel suffocated; you have created the suffocation yourself.\nThe self, the real self, the supreme self, is beyond any person, identification, form, process, position. But they all arise in it and dissolve in it – it is the ocean. The self is the space in which everything appears and disappears. That space has to be found within yourself. Don’t get identified with any content, otherwise the ego arises.\nFor example, there is sadness surrounding you. Immediately you become identified, you say, “I am sad.” That is stupid, unintelligent, you are unaware, you don’t know what you are saying. You are not the sadness, you are the witness. Sadness is there, but you are separate from it: you are the knower of it.\nSay, “I am seeing that sadness surrounds me,” but don’t say, “I am sad.” Anger is there, but don’t say, “I am anger,” or “I am angry.” Simply say, “There is anger, I can see it is there.” Anger is the content of your consciousness, it is not the consciousness itself. Consciousness is the space, the witnessing space.\nThis is the revolution, if you forget the content and remember the consciousness. Two things are continuously happening in you: the content and consciousness. A thought passes through your mind and you become identified with it; you say, “I am it.” If you are hungry, you say,’I am hungry.” Please be a little more aware: say, “I watch, I am a witness, that the body is feeling hungry.”\nWhen you have eaten well and you feel satiated, don’t say, “I am satiated.” Again, remember. Because of our ignorance we have created a wrong kind of language too. We say, “I am satiated.” You were never hungry and you are never satiated. Hunger was a content, so is satiation. Sadness was a content, so is happiness.\nThis mindfulness Sufis call ZIKR, remembrance. Buddha has called it “mindfulness, right awareness.”\nJust go on cutting yourself off from the content. Slowly slowly, the bridge is broken. The day you recognize the fact that you are never the content but always the consciousness, you have arrived home.\nThe English word ‘contemplation’ is very beautiful; it comes from a root ‘tem’. ‘Tem’ means ‘to cut off’. From the same root comes ‘temple’; that too is beautiful. ‘Temple’ means that which cuts you off from the world, and ‘contemplation’ means the process of cutting yourself off from the mind, from the content. Identification is the fall: you become Adam, you are expelled. Through disidentification, cutting yourself off from the mind and its contents, you become Christ. You are no longer outgoing, the inner journey has started. Adam has turned towards the source, is returning home.\nThe self arises out of identification, self with a lower-case s arises out of identification. Self with a capital S arises out of disidentification. And this is the whole art of religion.\nYOU ARE WHAT YOU ARE: HENCE YOUR LOVE AND HATES; YOU ARE WHAT YOU ARE:\nHENCE FAITH AND UNBELIEF.\nRight now you are a duality: your consciousness and its content. You are divided into these two. Hence in your whole life there is a dualism. You love the same person and you hate the same person, you believe and you disbelieve. And they go together – belief and disbelief, love and hate, anger and compassion, happiness and unhappiness, there are two sides of the same coin. Because YOU are double, each act of yours is going to be double, dual. And in that duality is misery, because in duality there is tension.\nYou are always torn apart. You love a woman, and you hate the same woman. Hence couples go on quarreling continuously. It is something to be understood. why do couples go on quarreling continuously? They love, certainly they love, but why do they hate? It remains a mystery if you don’t understand the duality of man. He is dual in everything. Unless you become disidentified from the mind, you will never become non-dual.\nThat’s why I say that only one who has arrived can love, and he can love without hate. His love will not have hate at all in it, his flame will be smokeless. Your flame cannot be smokeless, your love will have smoke – your love will remain poisoned with hate. Your belief is nothing but hidden disbelief; behind your belief there is always doubt. You say, “I believe in God” – but just search a little bit more and you will see that there is doubt.\nWhen one is pure consciousness, there is neither belief nor disbelief. That state is called trust: there is no doubt and there is no belief.\nA man, a professor of philosophy, came to Sri Aurobindo and asked him, “Do you believe in God?” And Aurobindo said, “No, not at all.”\nThe philosopher was very much puzzled and confused. He had come a long long way from a faraway place to see this man, thinking that he had KNOWN God. And here is this man, and he says, “I don’t even BELIEVE in God.” The philosopher asked, “What are you saying? You don’t believe in God?”\nAurobindo said, “Yes – I cannot believe in God, because I know him.”\nWhen you know, you know; there is no question of belief. Belief is out of ignorance, belief is because of doubt. If you ask me, I cannot say I believe in God; I know.\nYou don’t believe in the sun, you KNOW. Do you believe this is day? If somebody believes, that will only show that he is blind. A man who has eyes need not believe that this is day – this is day! Only a blind man can believe this is day.\nWhen consciousness is not contaminated by any contents moving around you, when your inner space is pure – it is always pure, you just have to recognize the fact – suddenly all duality disappears. And with duality, hell.\nHell is nothing but duality. Loving the same man and hating the same man is hell, believing in God and doubting God is hell. You are moving in diametrically opposite directions, you will fall apart. It is a miracle how you go on holding yourself together at all, why you don’t fall from the wall like Humpty Dumpty.\nHOPE AND FEAR DRIVE FORTUNE FROM YOUR DOOR:\nLOSE YOURSELF, AND THEY WILL BE NO MORE.\nSanai says: Hope and fear are two aspects of the same coin. If you hope, there will always be fear. Hope is out of fear, it is not against fear. You are hoping that tomorrow something is going to happen, something great for which you have always been hoping. Now, can you be without fear? It may happen, it may not happen; you may be able to make it, you may not be able to make it. It is always a question of to be or not to be, it is always ambiguous, and there is fear.\nBuddha says: Drop hope. And the first time he said to a disciple, “Drop hope,” the disciple was puzzled. He said, “If I drop hope then all is lost! Because it is hope I live through and I live for.”\nBuddha said, “Don’t be worried – drop hope!” And you will be surprised, because the moment you drop hope, fear disappears. And when there is no fear and no hope, on is integrated; there is no division.\nDivision is hell. To become integrated is heaven – to become crystallized, to be one: one piece, one whole, one unity; not even a union but a unity. Remember, a union is not a unity, it is an arrangement: you have many selves and they have all arranged to live in a kind of coexistence, they have decided not to fight. This is a union – but the fight can break out at any moment.\nHindus and Mohammedans lived for so many years in Aligarh silently; that was a union. Then one day, anything, any nonsense, and the union is gone. Hindus and Mohammedans had lived so long in this country together; it was a union, and now it is gone. Now there are two countries, India and Pakistan. Then Pakistan was divided into two countries, Bangladesh and Pakistan.\nThese are all unions. A unity means all the small selves have disappeared and the Supreme Self has arrived. Now there is no possibility of ever becoming divided again.\nAT HIS DOOR, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MOSLEM AND CHRISTIAN, VIRTUOUS AND GUILTY?\nAT HIS DOOR ALL ARE SEEKERS AND HE THE SOUGHT.\nMeditate over these beautiful words of Sanai. At his door nobody is a Christian or a Mohammedan or a Hindu or a Buddhist. At his door you are a lover and he the beloved. At his door you are the seeker and he is the sought. At his door you are the river and he is the ocean.\nAnd when the Ganges disappears in e ocean, do you think the ocean receives the Ganges in a different way than it receives other rivers? The ocean does not even know the name – which is the Ganges and which is the Brahmaputra and which is the Volga and which is the Amazon. When the river disappears in the ocean it loses all name, all form.\nThat’s why I say again and again that a really religious person cannot be a Mohammedan and cannot be Hindu and cannot be Jaina and cannot be a Sikh. A really religious person is only a lover, a seeker. He cannot become identified with any church; he cannot have any adjective.\nMohammed is not a Mohammedan, cannot be. And Christ is not a Christian, cannot be. And Buddha is not a Buddhist, cannot be.\nAnd I say to you: Don’t you be Hindus and Mohammedans and Christians and Buddhists, either. If you become a Buddhist you will never be a Buddha, remember, and if you become a Mohammedan you will never be a Mohammed. if you become a Christian you have missed an opportunity of being a Christ – and to be a Christ is beautiful and to be a Mohammed is a benediction. To be a Mohammedan, to be a Hindu, is just ugly; it is just political, and nothing else. It has nothing to do with religion.\nListen to this great Sufi, Sanai:\nAT HIS DOOR, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MOSLEM AND CHRISTIAN, VIRTUOUS AND GUILTY?\nHe says: There is not even a difference between the sinner and the saint. At his door, differences disappear. Nobody is a sinner and nobody is a saint, and nobody is virtuous and nobody is guilty.\nYou will not reach to God as virtuous, because that is the ego. To feel that “I am virtuous” is the subtlest ego – to feel about oneself, “I know, because I have crammed the Vedas; I know, because I can recite the Koran.” If you try to reach God as knowledgeable, you will never reach him; his doors will remain closed for you. His doors can open only when you are innocent. When you are neither virtuous nor guilty, when you are neither knowledgeable nor ignorant, when you are neither a man nor a woman, neither white nor black – only then.\nI have heard:\nA negro knocked on the door of a church one night. In the day of course he was afraid: the church belonged to white people, they wouldn’t allow him to. But he knew the priest, he was a nice man: maybe at night, when nobody was looking, he might allow him in – he wanted to worship in the church.\nThe priest opened the door. He WAS a nice man – but to be a nice man is one thing, and to be a real man is totally different. All those nice formalities are just pseudo, phoney. He had been saying great things, but when this negro knocked on the door and he opened the door and the negro said, “Would you please allow me to come in? I will not tell anybody, but I want to worship God,” the priest was puzzled: what to do? His mask was that of a nice man, very religious, saintly; because of the mask, he could not say no. But deep down, the reality was that he was as much a sectarian, a believer in color segregation, as anybody else. So his deeper core was not ready to allow the man to come in – the church would be polluted, poisoned.\nSo he found a strategy, a technique, to avoid the situation. He said, “Yes, you can come in but first you have to become pure. I will give you a prayer: do this prayer, it takes years before one becomes pure. When you have become pure, come back, and if I see that you have become pure, I will allow you to come in.”\nThe poor man believed him. This was just a strategy to avoid the situation, so that the priest need not say yes or no. And this was a tricky thing. If he ever comes, you can always say, “You have not become pure yet: go and do the prayer some more.”\nThe man was simple; he went away and prayed. For three weeks, day and night, he was praying. Even when he was working he was praying and praying.\nAnd by the third week, the priest saw him coming towards the church and he became very much afraid, because the man had such a beautiful aura. He was so full of light that the priest was dazzled. He said, “Now it is difficult – what am I going to say? He has done it. He is coming as the purest person I have ever seen. I am not that pure myself; this aura has not appeared around me either. And this man is coming full of light, radiating light.”\nAnd when the man came closer, the priest was trembling. “Now if he asks, I cannot say no. But I HAVE to say no!”\nBut the man never came. He just came close to the church, laughed, and went away.\nThe priest was even more puzzled. He rushed after the man, caught hold of him, and said, “What is the matter? You were coming to the church, were you not?”\nHe said, “No!”\n“Then why did you laugh?”\nHe said, “I laughed because last night God appeared to me, and he said, ‘Man, why are you trying to get into that church? I don’t live there anymore! And believe me,’ he said, ‘that they will never allow you to come in – because they don’t even allow me!’”\nChurches are empty, temples are empty, mosques are empty. God lives there no more. GOD IS WITHOUT CAUSE:\nWHY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR CAUSES? THE SUN OF TRUTH RISES UNBIDDEN,\nAND WITH IT SETS THE MOON OF LEARNING.\nGod is without cause: why are you looking for causes? And people go on asking, “HOW can I attain to God? How can I cause God to happen to me?” God has no cause. He is already here: he does not have to be caused, he does not even have to be called forth. He was here before you ever existed and he will be here long after you are gone forever.\nGod IS. No asceticism is needed. He makes no conditions on you: “First you must fast, then I will come.” That will be a wrong kind of God who wants you to suffer hunger for many many days, only then will he come. That will be a sadistic God who wants to torture people: “First stand naked in the hot sun for years and years, only then will I come.”\nNo mother behaves like that with her child. No mother asks the child to remain hungry for many days, only then will she give her love to me child.\nGod is the matrix, the mater, the mother. God is the mother out of which we all arise and into which we all disappear. God is love! How can he ask for the stupid things that ascetics have been doing down the ages!\nSufism is not ascetic. God wants you to celebrate. Look at these trees, how green they are and how juicy. Look at his roses, how red they are an dhow alive. Look at his birds on the wing, look at his stars – the whole existence is a dance, the whole existence is a constant celebration. Why should he ask you to become long faces, sad, shrunken? Do you think he wants you to become ugly – to torture yourself, to be violent with yourself, then you will be able to cause him, then you will be able to provoke him? He makes no conditions, remember. His love is unconditional. He has loved you already, that’s why he has created you. Now it is not a question of causing him; he has caused you. Then what has to be done?\nTHE SUN OF TRUTH RISES UNBIDDEN...\nYou need not call him, you need not provoke him, you need not even prepare for him. All that is needed is that you become disidentified from something that you are not. Whenever you are your reality, your natural reality, God is – because that nature is God. And the moment you are disidentified from all the rubbish of the mind, the moon of learning sets and the sun of wisdom rises in you.\nUncalled, uncaused, he comes of his own accord. God is a happening, it is not something that you have to do. You have to allow it, that’s all. You have to become available, open – and he starts descending, he starts rising, he surrounds you from all nooks and corners, he overfloods you and he starts overflowing from you.\nThis is my experience, this can be your experience too. Sanai is speaking out of his experience; these are not the words of a philosopher, these are the pregnant messages of a mystic.\nIN THIS HALT OF BUT A WEEK, TO BE IS NOT TO BE,\nAND TO COME IS TO GO.\nDon’t become too attached to things here, because it is only a question of a week. Whether seven days or seventy years, it doesn’t matter: soon you will be gone, and all that you have accumulated will be lost. You come empty-handed, you will go empty-handed. Can’t you live empty-handed? If you can live empty-handed, God is all yours.\nAnd by living empty-handed I don’t mean that you have to go to the Himalayas. It is only an awareness. You live as you live, you just change the attitude. I am not saying renounce the world; it is HIS world – if you renounce it, it is insulting to God. I am not saying renounce your family; it is HIS family – if you renounce it, you are behaving badly towards God.\nThen what has to be done? Live in the world and yet not be part of it. Remain empty inside, continuously remembering that your consciousness is a pure mirror. In that awareness, God happens. God is a happening.\nAND DOES THE SUN EXIST FOR THE COCK TO CROW AT? WHAT IS IT TO HIM\nWHETHER YOU ARE THERE OR NOT? MANY HAVE COME, JUST LIKE YOU, TO HIS DOOR.\nAnd don’t brag about your religiousness. Don’t brag about your disciplines, don’t brag that you have done this for God and that for God. Love never brags, love does things for the sheer joy of it. You do whatsoever is natural to you, for the sheer joy of it. If you want to paint, paint; if you want to sing, sing; if you want to sculpt, sculpt. Whatsoever you feel like doing, do – but remember, you are not the doer, he is the doer. Let him take possession of you.\nYou disappear. Let him act through you, and then each act becomes so beautiful, so incredibly beautiful, that you cannot imagine. Then whatsoever you do is holy.\nYOU WON’T FIND YOUR WAY\nIN THIS STREET; IF THERE IS A WAY, IT IS ON YOU ROAD OF SIGHS.\nALL OF YOU ARE FAR\nFROM THE ROAD OF DEVOTION:\nSOMETIMES YOU ARE VIRTUOUS, SOMETIMES YOU ARE WICKED:\nSO YOU HOPE FOR YOURSELVES, FEAR FOR YOURSELVES; BUT WHEN YOUR MASK OF WISDOM AND FOLLY\nAT LAST TURNS WHITE, YOU WILL SEE THAT HOPE AND FEAR ARE ONE.\nYou won’t find your way in this street. What street? The street of duality: the street of hope and fear, the street of love and hate, the street of darkness and light, the street of the Hindu and the Mohammedan. You will not find God on this street; he does not exist in duality. He is prior to duality, he is before the bifurcation happens. Then where will you find him?\n... IF THERE IS A WAY, says Sanai, IT IS ON YOUR ROAD OF SIGHS.\nTears. Tears of love, sighs of the heart. It is not on the street of the head but on the street of the heart. Sufism proposes a heart-wakefulness: become loving and aware in your heart. Sufism is the path of love.\nALL OF YOU ARE FAR\nFROM THE ROAD OF DEVOTION...\nBuddhism is the path of meditation, Zen is meditation. Sufism is the path of love, Sufism is love. And there are only two ways to reach him: either through meditation or through love. And they both meet at the peak, they both become one at the peak. If you attain to one, the other is attained just as part of it; it is only a question of emphasis.\nIf you become meditative you will be surprised: after meditation, love comes of its own accord. If you love, you will be surprised again: meditation comes just as a shadow behind it.\nLove is the heart of meditation, meditation is the heart of love. They are together, two names for the same phenomenon. The approaches are different, but the same peak, the same climax, is attained. A few people will find it easy to follow the path of meditation – in fact fifty percent of people in the world will find it easy to follow the path of meditation: Zen is their way. And fifty percent will find love closer to their being: Sufism is their way.\nIn a real world, an intelligent world, there will be only two paths, Sufism and Zen, and all else will disappear. All else is futile. Why two? Because there are men and there are women. And remember, by “men” I don’t mean biological men, because there are women who are psychologically men, and there are men who are psychologically women. I mean psychological men and women. There are men who are more capable of love than any woman, but they are few. There are a few women who are more capable of meditation than any man, but they are few. The majority of women will have to follow Sufism, and the majority of men will have to follow Zen. But biologically it cannot be determined; it is a totally different affair. You have to watch yourself: whichever feels good for you, whichever feels natural, spontaneous, that is your path.\nSanai has the heart of a woman. All Sufis have the heart of a woman. ALL OF YOU ARE FAR\nFROM THE ROAD OF DEVOTION:\nSOMETIMES YOU ARE VIRTUOUS, SOMETIMES YOU ARE WICKED...\nBut never devoted. Neither is virtue going to help, nor is your wickedness going to help; that keeps you divided.\nI have heard:\nA man was about to make his first parachute jump and was very nervous. The instructor tried to reassure him that nothing could happen because first the parachute would open by itself; and if by some remote possibility it didn’t, then there was a backup parachute he could pull the string on; and thirdly if both didn’t work he was to call out the name of the Devil three times.\nTo make the story short, he jumped and the first parachute failed to open, then the second failed to respond, and in desperation he yelled out “Devil” three times and sure enough a giant hand appeared under him and gently carried him to earth and placed him on the ground. He fell to his knees and in prayer position cried out, “Thank God!”\nWhereupon the giant hand reached over and crushed him to death.\nGod or the Devil, it is again the same duality, and the duality is going to crush you. Virtue or wickedness, it is the same duality, and the duality is going to crush you.\nGod is not your God, because your God is something against the Devil. God is something beyond your God and Devil: God is transcendental, God is a transcendence. This transcendence is possible, easily possible; it is not arduous either. Let me remind you again: just change your gestalt from the contents to the consciousness, from the mind to the space in which the mind exists.\nThere are clouds in the sky: you can see the clouds, then you forget the sky. Change your gestalt: see the sky and forget the clouds. That brings transformation.\nThe sky is your consciousness, and your thoughts, your desires, are nothing but clouds; they come and go. They don’t touch your sky at all, your sky remains virgin. You are pure from eternity, and you will remain pure to eternity. Purity is your nature. To recognize this, to realize this, is to become enlightened.\nAnd keep the fire of discontent burning. Unless you have become enlightened, don’t leave any stone unturned. You have to become that which you are, because only then is there bliss and only then is there freedom and only then is there benediction.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9694","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/unio_mystica_vol_2/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/unio_mystica_vol_2/>Unio Mystica, Vol 2</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">1 On the Road of Sighs</h1><div class=post-meta>46 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9694 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Unio_Mystica_Vol_2/part1.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

It is eternally new, it is eternally fresh, as fresh as the dewdrops in
the morning or the stars in the night.</p><p><br></p><p>The claim of tradition is basically anti-truth. The word ‘tradition’
comes from a root ‘tradere’. It means ‘handed by someone to somebody
else, transferred’. From ‘tradere’ also comes the word ‘trade’. Truth
cannot be transferred from one person to another person. It is
impossible to transfer it. It is not a thing, hence it is not
transferable. It cannot be traded, nobody can give it, nobody can take
it. It arises in each individual’s own being, it is a flowering of your
own heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, Sufism is not a tradition. No true religion can ever be a
tradition; every true religion is bound to be a revolution, a rebellion.
Sufism is one of the most profound, most authentic experiments and
inquiries into truth that has happened on this earth. And Hakim Sanai,
into whose sutras we will be entering again today, is one of the three
greatest Sufis in the whole history of human consciousness. He makes up
the trio of the three great masters, Attar, Rumi and Sanai.</p><p><br></p><p>For a few days, you will be moving again with one of the greatest
souls. It is a pilgrimage, a holy pilgrimage; you will be walking on
sacred ground. Be very alert, watchful, loving, open, vulnerable, then
something can arise in you which can become a transformation; something
can be triggered in you. But remember, it is not caused from the
outside, it is not a question of cause and effect. Hence it is beyond
the reach of science. Science can only understand the law of cause and
effect. If something can be caused, it is bound to fall into the field
of science. But truth cannot be caused.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, in the presence of the master it can happen. It happens
uncaused; it is a synchronicity. It is as if somebody is dancing and
something is triggered in you – not caused, remember, because no dancer
can cause a dance in you, but you start feeling something. You start
swaying, you suddenly feel a rush of energy, you would like to dance
yourself. This is synchronicity: something has happened in you, parallel
but not caused.</p><p><br></p><p>I will be here just like a hollow bamboo, available to Hakim Sanai so
that he can sing his song and he can dance his dance. If you are open,
something can start happening in you. It will not be transferred from me
to you – it cannot be transferred; it will not be caused. I will not be
the source of it, you will remain the source of it. But it can be
triggered: I can function as a catalytic agent.</p><p><br></p><p>These few days, walking with Hakim Sanai, can be life-transforming.
You will be here with one of the greatest human beings ever – a human
being of the caliber of Buddha, Jesus and Mohammed.</p><p>But remember, the first thing, truth is not a tradition. If you
believe in tradition, you will never come to know what truth is.
Tradition is a belief, borrowed; it is knowledge but not experience.
Tradition is scripture, philosophy, words and words – words and words
about words. It is a great jungle of theories, and you can be deceived
by it very easily. The mind is ready to fall into the trap of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Because truth is not a tradition, it cannot be approached through the
mind. The mind is a tradition, the mind lives out of the past. The mind
is always old; the mind is never original, it is never new, it is never
fresh, it is never young, it is never alive. The mind is nothing but the
accumulated past; all that you have known in the past has become a tape
inside you. It is not the reality of this moment. The mind is a
tradition.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence if somebody says he is a Hindu or a Christian or a Jaina or a
Mohammedan is not religious. He is saying he belongs to the past, not to
the present. He is saying he belongs to the mind and not to
consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Consciousness is always of the here and now: it knows no past, it
knows no future. And that is the beauty of consciousness – it is
meditative. The mind is a thought process, a procession of memories,
imaginations, dreams, projections. Consciousness is a purity, a mirror,
that simply reflects the reality as it is.</p><p><br></p><p>All belief systems have to be dropped, only then can you be a Sufi.
And to be a Sufi is the greatest thing that can happen to anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody else except man can be deceived by words; nobody except man
can be deceived at all. I have heard:</p><p>Marilyn had a parrot for a pet, but the parrot would embarrass her
whenever she came into the apartment with a man. He would shout all
kinds of obscenities, always leading off with, “Somebody’s gonna get it
tonight! Somebody’s gonna get it tonight!”</p><p><br></p><p>In desperation, Marilyn went to her local pet shop and explained her
parrot problem to the pet shop proprietor.</p><p><br></p><p>“What you need,” he said, “is a female parrot too. I don’t have one
on hand, but I’ll order one. Meanwhile, you could borrow this female owl
until the female parrot arrives”</p><p><br></p><p>Marilyn took the owl home and put it near her parrot. It was
immediately obvious that the parrot didn’t care for the owl. He glared
at it.</p><p><br></p><p>That night, Marilyn wasn’t her usual nervous self as she opened the
door to bring her gentleman friend in for a nightcap. Then suddenly she
heard the parrot screech and she knew that things hadn’t changed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Somebody’s gonna get it tonight! Somebody’s gonna get it tonight!”
the parrot said. The owl said, “Whooo? Whooo?”</p><p>And the parrot said, “Not you, you big-eyed son-of-a-bitch!”</p><p><br></p><p>Only man can be deceived. You cannot deceive even a parrot, but
pundits can be deceived and ARE deceived. Pundits are greater parrots
than parrots themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Beware. Your mind is ready to fall into any trap of words. It can
create beautiful theories, philosophies; it can go on manufacturing
great systems of thought – all imaginary.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth has nothing to do with your imagination. Neither has truth
anything to do with your inference, your guesswork. Truth is already
here: truth is. All that is needed on your part is not to seek and
search for it but to be available, open and empty like a mirror, so that
you can reflect that which is. Truth surrounds you; truth is within and
without. Only truth is. you need not go anywhere, to Kaaba or to Kashi.
You need not even go outside your room, you need not even go outside
your body, you need not go anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>Sitting silently, doing nothing, the spring comes and the grass grows
by itself. Just sitting silently in your own room, when you are empty,
it is revealed.</p><p>It was revealed to Mohammed when he was utterly silent and empty, it
was revealed to Sanai when he was silent and empty, it was revealed to
Mahavira when he was silent and empty. To be empty is to be
religious.</p><p><br></p><p>But you are so full of knowledge, you are so full of unnecessary
luggage, your mind is so much in a constant chattering. You may call it
the Veda or you may call it the Koran, it doesn’t matter. Unless you are
empty, the Veda is not going to happen to you, the Koran is not going to
flow through you. Unless you are empty, you will not contact truth – and
truth is another name for God. I am using the word ‘truth’ so that even
atheists are not offended, but truth and God are synonymous,
interchangeable, they mean the same thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Then what is truth if it is not a tradition? It is a revolution, it
is a turning-in. Tradition looks backwards, tradition looks at others,
tradition wants something to be given to you. Revolution looks inwards.
Nothing has to be given to you from any source; you have already got it,
it is already the case. Just turning in, just looking inside, waiting,
watching, going inwards to the core of your being – and it is there.</p><p><br></p><p>Sufism is an inner journey. By revolution I don’t mean a political
revolution. Political revolutions are not revolutions at all; they only
substitute one slavery for another slavery. The only revolution there
is, is religious. The only revolution there is, is turning away from
tradition and turning inwards to the source of your being.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing “Who am I?” is the only revolutionary step – the first and
the last, the alpha and the omega.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s the meaning of becoming a Sufi, or becoming a sannyasin.
‘Sannyasin’ is my name for the Sufi: one who is fed up with the outside
world, who has known its frustrations, who has known its utter futility,
who has known all the anxiety and anguish of it and is ready to dive
deep within oneself to know “Who am I?” Because unless one knows
oneself, all knowledge is useless.</p><p>The foremost, the most fundamental thing, is to become aware at the
core of your being. And it is a miracle to become aware of it, because
at the core of your being you are always pure, always innocent, always
virgin, always celibate. At the very core of your being, you have never
left the Garden of Eden, you are still in paradise.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the name of Hakim Sanai’s book: THE HADIQA. It means ‘the
Garden’ – the Garden of God, paradise.</p><p><br></p><p>Where is this paradise? There are foolish people who have been
searching for the Garden of Eden. A few think it was in Babylon, a few
think it was on the continent of Atlantis which has gone down under the
ocean – there has been a search. This is complete stupidity.</p><p><br></p><p>The Garden exists in YOU Adam has not been expelled from the Garden
of Eden, he has fallen asleep. ‘The original fall’ simply means you have
forgotten who you are. Adam has become knowledgeable and has lost his
purity of consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s the meaning of the parable of the Tree of Knowledge. Adam has
eaten from the Tree of Knowledge – that is the original sin. See the
beauty of the parable: knowledge is the original sin, to become
knowledgeable is to fall from grace. Then how to attain it again? Drop
your knowledge, become innocent again. Be a child again, and you will be
able to enter into the Garden of Eden.</p><p><br></p><p>Adam becomes knowledgeable, Christ becomes innocent. Becoming
knowledgeable, Adam starts moving outwards, falls victim to
philosophies, belief systems, theories, words. Jesus dropped all
tradition; that’s why the Jews were so angry with him. The Jews are a
very traditional people, they were angry because he was a revolutionary.
He was a drop-out – he simply dropped all the knowledge of all the
ancient rabbis and he became innocent. But in becoming innocent he again
entered that original state of Adam before he had eaten the fruit of
knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard:</p><p><br></p><p>Two university professors are walking around the campus. They are
well-known historians and are voicing their respective opinions about
Jesus. When they are about to part, one says thoughtfully, “You know, he
was really a good fellow, but he didn’t publish.”</p><p><br></p><p>The professor, the pundit, the knowledgeable person, the scholar, has
no understanding about inner experiences. All that he knows is the
rubbish of so-called research work, all that he knows is about words.
Those words are hollow, they contain nothing, they are meaningless –
because meaning arises only out of one’s own experience.</p><p><br></p><p>Sufism is an experiment in existential experience. It is not a
philosophy; rather, think of it as a ladder. You don’t agree with or
believe in a ladder; you don’t believe in it, you don’t disbelieve in
it, either. You climb it, and if it breaks you get a new one. Thus to
treat Sufism as a system to be believed in or committed to or attached
to, is to miss the whole point. It is a ladder, not a belief system. Use
it, climb it, and go beyond it. It is a boat.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha calls his system a raft: that’s exactly what Sufism is. Use it
to go to the other shore, to the further shore, then forget all about
it. The truth believed is a lie, the truth borrowed is a lie. My
truth</p><p>cannot be your truth; the moment my truth reaches you, it is no more
the same thing. With me, in me, it had the meaning of my experience.
When it goes to you, only words reach you – empty, hollow. You can cling
to those words, you can believe too much in those words, and you will be
lost.</p><p><br></p><p>This is something very basic to be remembered, that Sufism is a
practical science, it is pragmatic. It does not depend on
philosophizing, speculating and guesswork; it points directly to
existential experience.</p><p><br></p><p>You can know much about love. You can go and look in the libraries,
you can look in the Encyclopedia Britannica, and you will know much
about love. But it will be ABOUT love – it will not be love. To know
love, you will have to fall in love; there is no other way, there is no
shortcut.</p><p><br></p><p>Two Italians in Rome were talking when an airplane flew overhead and
one said to the other, “The pope is aboard that plane.”</p><p><br></p><p>“No,” said the other, “he is in southern Italy at the summer
Vatican.” “No, he is aboard that plane,” said the other.</p><p>One word led to another, and before long, several thousand liras were
bet on whether or not the pope was aboard that plane. The two men rushed
to the airport in time to observe the pope emerging from the plane.</p><p><br></p><p>The one who lost the bet turned to his friend and said, “Tell me,
Tony, how could you tell, twenty thousand feet in the air, that the pope
was aboard that plane?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Easy,” he said. “It says so right on the outside of the airplane:
TWA.” “What does that mean?”</p><p>“Top Wop Aboard.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes your guess may even work, but still it is never the truth.
Truth has to be experienced.</p><p><br></p><p>You are guessing about God, you are arguing about God, speculating
about God, fighting about God. And no time is left for experiencing
him.</p><p><br></p><p>Being here with me, remember it always: we are not interested in any
guesswork, we are interested in going to the real experience of it. And
when the experience is possible, why bother arguing about it? Why go
round and round? Why not penetrate to the very core? You can go round
and round for centuries and you will never arrive anywhere. And you can
arrive right now, this very moment, if you go inwards.</p><p><br></p><p>All these sutras of THE HADIQA are just preparing you to take the
inner leap, the inner jump.</p><p><br></p><p>Sufism is an attempt to unfreeze habits of thinking, to replace them
with less stiff and restricting ones. Sufism is criticizing, dissolving
and stepping over all prejudices, loosening all rigid and constricting
moulds of thought. Sufism is relaxing into your own self; it is a
let-go.</p><p>When all prejudices have been dropped, all concepts rejected, all
scriptures, burnt, the whole tradition dropped, then you are innocent,
you are unpolluted. In that purity of the present moment, the sun
rises.</p><p><br></p><p>And that is from where one starts growing into a real human being. It
is from there that one starts growing even beyond humanity; one starts
surpassing, one starts transcending ordinary human limits. Real growth
knows no limit. You contain something infinite in you, something
oceanic, and unless you have known it, don’t be satisfied, don’t be
contented. That contentment will be suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>I see millions of people: they are all dead, they have committed
suicide, because they have become contented – and contented with futile
things, contented with nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Never be contented unless you have known your inner being, unless you
have come to the innermost shrine. Remain discontented. Sufis call it
“the divine discontentment.”</p><p><br></p><p>Teilhard de Chardin says, “The most real aspect of living is the
passion for growth.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, be in a passionate affair with your own growth. Never allow a
single day to pass without growing, otherwise you will remain a seed and
you will never know the beauties of being a flower. The spring will come
and go, and you will remain dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Millions of people are dead. They walk, they talk, they do their job,
but all that is mechanical, utterly mechanical. They are moving in a
kind of sleep, they are somnambulists.</p><p><br></p><p>A man took his wife to a Broadway show. During the first act
intermission, he had to urinate in the worst way. He hurried to the back
of the theater and searched in vain for the men’s room.</p><p><br></p><p>At last he came upon a fountain surrounded by pretty foliage. He
realized that he had wandered backstage. Noting that no one was around,
and in desperation, he opened his pants and pissed into the
fountain.</p><p><br></p><p>He had difficulty finding his way back to the auditorium, and by the
time he sat down next to his wife, the curtain was up and actors were
moving about on the stage.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did I miss much of the second act?” he whispered. “Miss it?” she
said. “You were in it!”</p><p>But that is the situation. People are moving unconsciously,
mechanically, unaware; they don’t know what they are doing. How can they
know what they are doing? because they don’t know who they are. If you
don’t know your being, you can’t be aware of your doing; it is
impossible. First, one has to be aware of the being – and that is
growth. Growing inwards is growth, reaching inwards is growth.</p><p><br></p><p>The sutras.</p><p>MY FRIEND, EVERYTHING EXISTING EXISTS THROUGH HIM;</p><p>YOUR OWN EXISTENCE IS A MERE PRETENSE. NO MORE NONSENSE! LOSE
YOURSELF,</p><p>AND THE HELL OF YOUR HEART BECOMES HEAVEN.</p><p><br></p><p>LOSE YOURSELF, AND ANYTHING CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED. YOUR SELFISHNESS IS
AN UNTRAINED COLT.</p><p>First, remember. Hakim Sanai addresses you as “My friend.” That’s the
attitude of all the great masters. The disciple thinks that the master
is very very far away – and from the side of the disciple it is true,
because he is fast asleep. In his sleep, the master is a faraway
star.</p><p><br></p><p>But the same is not the case from the side of the master. The master
knows that you may be asleep but you are a buddha, you may be asleep but
you are a God. The disciple may not know that he is a God, but the
master knows it. The moment he knows himself to be divine, he knows the
whole existence to be divine. From the master’s side, nobody is a
disciple, all are masters. A few are asleep, a few are awake; the
difference is only that much. From the side of the master, it is only a
question of time: tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, or who knows –
even today you may become enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>The potential is there. From the side of the seed, the flower is far
away. But the flower knows that the seed contains flowers, infinite
flowers. From the side of the flower, the seed is a friend.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you find a master who does not think in those terms, then
remember, know well, he is not a master yet. If he thinks that you are
sinners, if he thinks that you are fallen souls, then he is not a master
yet; he has not come to realize his own reality.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha is reported to have said, “The day I became enlightened, the
whole existence became enlightened for me – even trees, even rocks.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hakim Sanai says:</p><p><br></p><p>MY FRIEND, EVERYTHING EXISTING EXISTS THROUGH HIM...</p><p>God is the only reality – or call it truth, or nature, or Tao, or
whatsoever you will. Names don’t matter. Don’t go on fighting about
names; X-Y-Z, anything will do. Just remember one thing, that something
is there, miraculously present, which surrounds all, which permeates
all.</p><p><br></p><p>Sufis say: As the absolute maximum, God contains all things. In fact
that is the definition of God: one who contains all. He is their
enfolding and their unfolding. God is in the seed, God is in the flower
– in the seed hidden, in the flower manifest. God is in the sinner and
is in the saint – in the sinner asleep, in the saint awake. But all is
God: God is equivalent to existence.</p><p>Christian mystics use two words: one is COMPLICATIO, it means
enfolding. God is COMPLICATIO, enfolding, and EXPLICATIO, unfolding.
These are the two movements of God: enfolding and manifesting. Each seed
becomes the flower, and then in its own turn the flower becomes the
seed, and the circle is complete.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as every night you fall asleep, and in the morning you are awake
again, so is God – in nature asleep, in Buddhas awake. Just to
understand it is a great liberation. Suddenly you have self-worth;
suddenly you are no more a condemned being. Suddenly you are an
essential part of existence; you are not accidental, you participate in
God’s work in your own way. You need God, God needs you; you are not
unneeded.</p><p><br></p><p>In this century, millions of people are feeling unneeded, because God
has disappeared from their lives. And this is one of the most
fundamental needs, to be needed. If you feel needed, you feel worthy. If
you feel not needed, you feel worthless, you feel like dirt.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why people get married, because a woman will be there who will
need them. Husbands don’t like their wives to work, because then they
are needed less, then they are worth less. Husbands like their wives to
be constantly in need of them; that gives them worth, a feeling of
importance.</p><p><br></p><p>The wife also in her own way makes the husband utterly dependent;
without her he will not be able to exist. Even if she goes away for one
day, the husband is at a loss. He cannot find a thing in his own house;
he comes to know that without the wife it is impossible to exist. Then
they both bring children into the world, and both are happy because the
children need them immensely, absolutely.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why people like children – they are helpless, they are
dependent. But sooner or later, the children will go their own way. And
this is one of the problems in the world: when children have gone their
own way and they have settled with their own families, then old people,
aged people, start feeling worthless – nobody needs them.</p><p><br></p><p>Now this is a psychological truth, that once a person starts feeling
he is not needed, he starts committing suicide, psychological suicide.
He dies then years earlier. When he is retired from his job he starts
shrinking – now he is no longer needed. He was a boss and so many people
were clamoring around him; he was doing something essential for the
society. That job is gone. Now if he dies, it will not make any
difference, the world will continue as it is.</p><p><br></p><p>Children become grown-up, they go to live their own lives, and the
old people simply feel discarded. They start dying slowly, shrinking.
They were healthy when they were in their work, when they were needed
they were healthy. But now suddenly something disappears; the earth
underneath their feet disappears, they are no longer needed.</p><p><br></p><p>We make arbitrary needs. But the man who has the sense that “God
exists, and I am needed by God,” never feels worthless – never. To the
last moment, to the last breath of his life, he is functioning, serving
something higher than himself. He has a context bigger than himself; in
that context, meaning arises.</p><p><br></p><p>Meaning is always in a certain context. A single word is meaningless;
when it is arranged in a poem it has tremendous meaning: now it has a
context. The color in a tube is meaningless; once it is</p><p>spread on the canvas and becomes part of a picture that is bigger
than it, it has a context, suddenly meaning arises.</p><p><br></p><p>It is reported that once a very rich man asked Pablo Picasso to make
a portrait of him, Picasso said, “It will be very costly.” The man was
so rich, he said, “Don’t bother about it. You need not even talk about
the cost, money doesn’t matter. Make my portrait and whatsoever you
demand, I will give.”</p><p><br></p><p>After six months the portrait was ready. The rich man came, but the
price that was asked was fantastic: one million dollars, just for a
small canvas and a few colors! The rich man said, “Are you joking? Just
for a few colors and a canvas?”</p><p><br></p><p>Picasso said, “Then okay, you can take an empty canvas and a few
tubes full of color and you can pay as much as you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>The rich man said, “But that is not the same.”</p><p><br></p><p>Picasso aid, “That’s what I am trying to point out to you. I have
created a context, I have created a gestalt, a pattern. And nobody else
can create it, hence the price. It is a Picasso painting: nobody else
can do it the way I have done it, it has my signature on it. The harmony
of the colors, the music of the colors, the poetry of the colors – that
is the thing. I am not asking the price for the colors but for something
that has become expressed through the colors.”</p><p><br></p><p>A real painting is not just the sum total of the colors, it is more –
and that “more” is the meaning. A real life is not the sum total of what
you do; unless there is something more to it, you live an inauthentic
life. That “more” is God. That poetry is God, that music is God, that
surrounds you and floods you.</p><p><br></p><p>People come to me and ask, “Where is God?” It is not a question of
asking “where”; God is a meaning, not a person. I cannot indicate,
“There – go there, and you will find him.” God has no address, God
cannot be located, it is a meaning. You have to create meaning in your
life, then God is. God has to be created.</p><p><br></p><p>And the beginning of creating God is to start becoming more and more
sensitive to the existence that surrounds you. The trees, the rocks, the
stars, the earth – you are surrounded by great poetry. But you remain
separate, hence you go on missing it.</p><p><br></p><p>MY FRIEND, EVERYTHING EXISTING EXISTS THROUGH HIM;</p><p>YOUR OWN EXISTENCE IS A MERE PRETENSE.</p><p><br></p><p>If you live as separate, if you think, “I am separate,” if you live
as an ego, then your existence is a pretense. Then your existence will
remain meaningless. Then you will never know the glory and the grandeur
of life; you will never know the splendors that have always been
available to you but you went on missing.</p><p>If you exist as a separate individual, you have created a wall around
yourself, you have become an island. And no man is an island, we are
parts of an infinite continent: that continent is God. We are parts of
an ocean. The moment you recognize it, that we are parts of an ocean,
your life starts having a context bigger than you, higher than you. In
that context is the beginning of meaning – and meaning is God.</p><p><br></p><p>NO MORE NONSENSE! says Sanai. LOSE YOURSELF, AND THE HELL OF YOUR
HEART BECOMES A HEAVEN.</p><p>Just a single step is enough: lose yourself. Don’t exist as an ‘I’,
don’t go on proclaiming yourself as an ego. Drop the ego, and suddenly,
immediately, instantly, the hell of your life turns into a heaven.
Misery disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>Misery is a by-product of your separation. Bliss is the shadow of
falling back into the unity: UNIO MYSTICA. When again you start feeling
like a wave in the ocean, misery cannot exist. What is misery? The fear
of death. But you can die only if you are separate, you cannot die if
you are not separate.</p><p><br></p><p>If the wave thinks, “I am separate from the ocean,” it is going to
die; it will remain afraid, trembling. If it knows it is part of the
ocean it is not going to die. It will fall back into the source, it will
come again; it will go, it will come, it will appear and disappear, but
it cannot die.</p><p><br></p><p>Birth is appearance, death is disappearance. But neither is birth the
beginning nor is death the end: the ocean continues. To have this
oceanic feeling is meditation, is prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>LOSE YOURSELF, AND ANYTHING CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the impossible is possible, because nothing is impossible for
God. We have unnecessarily become too narrow, too tiny; we have become
mundane. We have lost our own heritage, we are not aware of all the
beauties that we contain and of all the potential that is intrinsically
present in us.</p><p><br></p><p>YOUR SELFISHNESS IS AN UNTRAINED COLT.</p><p><br></p><p>Your selfishness is nothing but your unawareness, your lack of
discipline. Create an inner discipline, a little training in awareness,
and your selfishness will disappear, because your SELF will
disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>And when there is no self left, then real Self with a capital S, the
Supreme Self, arrives. You disappear as a wave, you appear as the ocean.
That is liberation.</p><p><br></p><p>Recognize the self – the self which is not the ego, the self which
has nothing of the ego in it. Hindu mystics have called it the ATMAN.
Buddha has given it a totally different name, not only different but
diametrically opposite: he has called it ANATTA, no-self.</p><p><br></p><p>The self is a no-self, because there is no ego in it. To be an ego is
to fall from your reality – the original sin. The self is not the ego,
absolutely not; it is not personal, either. It is misleading to speak of
“my self.” The self is universal. The moment you say “my self” you have
lost track of the universal and you have become small. Now you will feel
suffocated; you have created the suffocation yourself.</p><p>The self, the real self, the supreme self, is beyond any person,
identification, form, process, position. But they all arise in it and
dissolve in it – it is the ocean. The self is the space in which
everything appears and disappears. That space has to be found within
yourself. Don’t get identified with any content, otherwise the ego
arises.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, there is sadness surrounding you. Immediately you become
identified, you say, “I am sad.” That is stupid, unintelligent, you are
unaware, you don’t know what you are saying. You are not the sadness,
you are the witness. Sadness is there, but you are separate from it: you
are the knower of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Say, “I am seeing that sadness surrounds me,” but don’t say, “I am
sad.” Anger is there, but don’t say, “I am anger,” or “I am angry.”
Simply say, “There is anger, I can see it is there.” Anger is the
content of your consciousness, it is not the consciousness itself.
Consciousness is the space, the witnessing space.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the revolution, if you forget the content and remember the
consciousness. Two things are continuously happening in you: the content
and consciousness. A thought passes through your mind and you become
identified with it; you say, “I am it.” If you are hungry, you say,’I am
hungry.” Please be a little more aware: say, “I watch, I am a witness,
that the body is feeling hungry.”</p><p><br></p><p>When you have eaten well and you feel satiated, don’t say, “I am
satiated.” Again, remember. Because of our ignorance we have created a
wrong kind of language too. We say, “I am satiated.” You were never
hungry and you are never satiated. Hunger was a content, so is
satiation. Sadness was a content, so is happiness.</p><p><br></p><p>This mindfulness Sufis call ZIKR, remembrance. Buddha has called it
“mindfulness, right awareness.”</p><p><br></p><p>Just go on cutting yourself off from the content. Slowly slowly, the
bridge is broken. The day you recognize the fact that you are never the
content but always the consciousness, you have arrived home.</p><p><br></p><p>The English word ‘contemplation’ is very beautiful; it comes from a
root ‘tem’. ‘Tem’ means ‘to cut off’. From the same root comes ‘temple’;
that too is beautiful. ‘Temple’ means that which cuts you off from the
world, and ‘contemplation’ means the process of cutting yourself off
from the mind, from the content. Identification is the fall: you become
Adam, you are expelled. Through disidentification, cutting yourself off
from the mind and its contents, you become Christ. You are no longer
outgoing, the inner journey has started. Adam has turned towards the
source, is returning home.</p><p><br></p><p>The self arises out of identification, self with a lower-case s
arises out of identification. Self with a capital S arises out of
disidentification. And this is the whole art of religion.</p><p><br></p><p>YOU ARE WHAT YOU ARE: HENCE YOUR LOVE AND HATES; YOU ARE WHAT YOU
ARE:</p><p>HENCE FAITH AND UNBELIEF.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now you are a duality: your consciousness and its content. You
are divided into these two. Hence in your whole life there is a dualism.
You love the same person and you hate the same person, you believe and
you disbelieve. And they go together – belief and disbelief, love and
hate, anger and compassion, happiness and unhappiness, there are two
sides of the same coin. Because YOU are double, each act of yours is
going to be double, dual. And in that duality is misery, because in
duality there is tension.</p><p><br></p><p>You are always torn apart. You love a woman, and you hate the same
woman. Hence couples go on quarreling continuously. It is something to
be understood. why do couples go on quarreling continuously? They love,
certainly they love, but why do they hate? It remains a mystery if you
don’t understand the duality of man. He is dual in everything. Unless
you become disidentified from the mind, you will never become
non-dual.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I say that only one who has arrived can love, and he can
love without hate. His love will not have hate at all in it, his flame
will be smokeless. Your flame cannot be smokeless, your love will have
smoke – your love will remain poisoned with hate. Your belief is nothing
but hidden disbelief; behind your belief there is always doubt. You say,
“I believe in God” – but just search a little bit more and you will see
that there is doubt.</p><p><br></p><p>When one is pure consciousness, there is neither belief nor
disbelief. That state is called trust: there is no doubt and there is no
belief.</p><p><br></p><p>A man, a professor of philosophy, came to Sri Aurobindo and asked
him, “Do you believe in God?” And Aurobindo said, “No, not at all.”</p><p><br></p><p>The philosopher was very much puzzled and confused. He had come a
long long way from a faraway place to see this man, thinking that he had
KNOWN God. And here is this man, and he says, “I don’t even BELIEVE in
God.” The philosopher asked, “What are you saying? You don’t believe in
God?”</p><p><br></p><p>Aurobindo said, “Yes – I cannot believe in God, because I know
him.”</p><p><br></p><p>When you know, you know; there is no question of belief. Belief is
out of ignorance, belief is because of doubt. If you ask me, I cannot
say I believe in God; I know.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t believe in the sun, you KNOW. Do you believe this is day?
If somebody believes, that will only show that he is blind. A man who
has eyes need not believe that this is day – this is day! Only a blind
man can believe this is day.</p><p><br></p><p>When consciousness is not contaminated by any contents moving around
you, when your inner space is pure – it is always pure, you just have to
recognize the fact – suddenly all duality disappears. And with duality,
hell.</p><p><br></p><p>Hell is nothing but duality. Loving the same man and hating the same
man is hell, believing in God and doubting God is hell. You are moving
in diametrically opposite directions, you will fall apart. It is a
miracle how you go on holding yourself together at all, why you don’t
fall from the wall like Humpty Dumpty.</p><p>HOPE AND FEAR DRIVE FORTUNE FROM YOUR DOOR:</p><p><br></p><p>LOSE YOURSELF, AND THEY WILL BE NO MORE.</p><p><br></p><p>Sanai says: Hope and fear are two aspects of the same coin. If you
hope, there will always be fear. Hope is out of fear, it is not against
fear. You are hoping that tomorrow something is going to happen,
something great for which you have always been hoping. Now, can you be
without fear? It may happen, it may not happen; you may be able to make
it, you may not be able to make it. It is always a question of to be or
not to be, it is always ambiguous, and there is fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha says: Drop hope. And the first time he said to a disciple,
“Drop hope,” the disciple was puzzled. He said, “If I drop hope then all
is lost! Because it is hope I live through and I live for.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “Don’t be worried – drop hope!” And you will be
surprised, because the moment you drop hope, fear disappears. And when
there is no fear and no hope, on is integrated; there is no
division.</p><p><br></p><p>Division is hell. To become integrated is heaven – to become
crystallized, to be one: one piece, one whole, one unity; not even a
union but a unity. Remember, a union is not a unity, it is an
arrangement: you have many selves and they have all arranged to live in
a kind of coexistence, they have decided not to fight. This is a union –
but the fight can break out at any moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Hindus and Mohammedans lived for so many years in Aligarh silently;
that was a union. Then one day, anything, any nonsense, and the union is
gone. Hindus and Mohammedans had lived so long in this country together;
it was a union, and now it is gone. Now there are two countries, India
and Pakistan. Then Pakistan was divided into two countries, Bangladesh
and Pakistan.</p><p><br></p><p>These are all unions. A unity means all the small selves have
disappeared and the Supreme Self has arrived. Now there is no
possibility of ever becoming divided again.</p><p><br></p><p>AT HIS DOOR, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MOSLEM AND CHRISTIAN,
VIRTUOUS AND GUILTY?</p><p>AT HIS DOOR ALL ARE SEEKERS AND HE THE SOUGHT.</p><p>Meditate over these beautiful words of Sanai. At his door nobody is a
Christian or a Mohammedan or a Hindu or a Buddhist. At his door you are
a lover and he the beloved. At his door you are the seeker and he is the
sought. At his door you are the river and he is the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>And when the Ganges disappears in e ocean, do you think the ocean
receives the Ganges in a different way than it receives other rivers?
The ocean does not even know the name – which is the Ganges and which is
the Brahmaputra and which is the Volga and which is the Amazon. When the
river disappears in the ocean it loses all name, all form.</p><p>That’s why I say again and again that a really religious person
cannot be a Mohammedan and cannot be Hindu and cannot be Jaina and
cannot be a Sikh. A really religious person is only a lover, a seeker.
He cannot become identified with any church; he cannot have any
adjective.</p><p><br></p><p>Mohammed is not a Mohammedan, cannot be. And Christ is not a
Christian, cannot be. And Buddha is not a Buddhist, cannot be.</p><p><br></p><p>And I say to you: Don’t you be Hindus and Mohammedans and Christians
and Buddhists, either. If you become a Buddhist you will never be a
Buddha, remember, and if you become a Mohammedan you will never be a
Mohammed. if you become a Christian you have missed an opportunity of
being a Christ – and to be a Christ is beautiful and to be a Mohammed is
a benediction. To be a Mohammedan, to be a Hindu, is just ugly; it is
just political, and nothing else. It has nothing to do with
religion.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen to this great Sufi, Sanai:</p><p><br></p><p>AT HIS DOOR, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MOSLEM AND CHRISTIAN,
VIRTUOUS AND GUILTY?</p><p>He says: There is not even a difference between the sinner and the
saint. At his door, differences disappear. Nobody is a sinner and nobody
is a saint, and nobody is virtuous and nobody is guilty.</p><p><br></p><p>You will not reach to God as virtuous, because that is the ego. To
feel that “I am virtuous” is the subtlest ego – to feel about oneself,
“I know, because I have crammed the Vedas; I know, because I can recite
the Koran.” If you try to reach God as knowledgeable, you will never
reach him; his doors will remain closed for you. His doors can open only
when you are innocent. When you are neither virtuous nor guilty, when
you are neither knowledgeable nor ignorant, when you are neither a man
nor a woman, neither white nor black – only then.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard:</p><p><br></p><p>A negro knocked on the door of a church one night. In the day of
course he was afraid: the church belonged to white people, they wouldn’t
allow him to. But he knew the priest, he was a nice man: maybe at night,
when nobody was looking, he might allow him in – he wanted to worship in
the church.</p><p><br></p><p>The priest opened the door. He WAS a nice man – but to be a nice man
is one thing, and to be a real man is totally different. All those nice
formalities are just pseudo, phoney. He had been saying great things,
but when this negro knocked on the door and he opened the door and the
negro said, “Would you please allow me to come in? I will not tell
anybody, but I want to worship God,” the priest was puzzled: what to do?
His mask was that of a nice man, very religious, saintly; because of the
mask, he could not say no. But deep down, the reality was that he was as
much a sectarian, a believer in color segregation, as anybody else. So
his deeper core was not ready to allow the man to come in – the church
would be polluted, poisoned.</p><p>So he found a strategy, a technique, to avoid the situation. He said,
“Yes, you can come in but first you have to become pure. I will give you
a prayer: do this prayer, it takes years before one becomes pure. When
you have become pure, come back, and if I see that you have become pure,
I will allow you to come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>The poor man believed him. This was just a strategy to avoid the
situation, so that the priest need not say yes or no. And this was a
tricky thing. If he ever comes, you can always say, “You have not become
pure yet: go and do the prayer some more.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man was simple; he went away and prayed. For three weeks, day and
night, he was praying. Even when he was working he was praying and
praying.</p><p><br></p><p>And by the third week, the priest saw him coming towards the church
and he became very much afraid, because the man had such a beautiful
aura. He was so full of light that the priest was dazzled. He said, “Now
it is difficult – what am I going to say? He has done it. He is coming
as the purest person I have ever seen. I am not that pure myself; this
aura has not appeared around me either. And this man is coming full of
light, radiating light.”</p><p><br></p><p>And when the man came closer, the priest was trembling. “Now if he
asks, I cannot say no. But I HAVE to say no!”</p><p><br></p><p>But the man never came. He just came close to the church, laughed,
and went away.</p><p><br></p><p>The priest was even more puzzled. He rushed after the man, caught
hold of him, and said, “What is the matter? You were coming to the
church, were you not?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “No!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then why did you laugh?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I laughed because last night God appeared to me, and he
said, ‘Man, why are you trying to get into that church? I don’t live
there anymore! And believe me,’ he said, ‘that they will never allow you
to come in – because they don’t even allow me!’”</p><p><br></p><p>Churches are empty, temples are empty, mosques are empty. God lives
there no more. GOD IS WITHOUT CAUSE:</p><p>WHY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR CAUSES? THE SUN OF TRUTH RISES UNBIDDEN,</p><p>AND WITH IT SETS THE MOON OF LEARNING.</p><p><br></p><p>God is without cause: why are you looking for causes? And people go
on asking, “HOW can I attain to God? How can I cause God to happen to
me?” God has no cause. He is already here: he does not have to be
caused, he does not even have to be called forth. He was here before you
ever existed and he will be here long after you are gone forever.</p><p>God IS. No asceticism is needed. He makes no conditions on you:
“First you must fast, then I will come.” That will be a wrong kind of
God who wants you to suffer hunger for many many days, only then will he
come. That will be a sadistic God who wants to torture people: “First
stand naked in the hot sun for years and years, only then will I
come.”</p><p><br></p><p>No mother behaves like that with her child. No mother asks the child
to remain hungry for many days, only then will she give her love to me
child.</p><p><br></p><p>God is the matrix, the mater, the mother. God is the mother out of
which we all arise and into which we all disappear. God is love! How can
he ask for the stupid things that ascetics have been doing down the
ages!</p><p><br></p><p>Sufism is not ascetic. God wants you to celebrate. Look at these
trees, how green they are and how juicy. Look at his roses, how red they
are an dhow alive. Look at his birds on the wing, look at his stars –
the whole existence is a dance, the whole existence is a constant
celebration. Why should he ask you to become long faces, sad, shrunken?
Do you think he wants you to become ugly – to torture yourself, to be
violent with yourself, then you will be able to cause him, then you will
be able to provoke him? He makes no conditions, remember. His love is
unconditional. He has loved you already, that’s why he has created you.
Now it is not a question of causing him; he has caused you. Then what
has to be done?</p><p><br></p><p>THE SUN OF TRUTH RISES UNBIDDEN...</p><p><br></p><p>You need not call him, you need not provoke him, you need not even
prepare for him. All that is needed is that you become disidentified
from something that you are not. Whenever you are your reality, your
natural reality, God is – because that nature is God. And the moment you
are disidentified from all the rubbish of the mind, the moon of learning
sets and the sun of wisdom rises in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Uncalled, uncaused, he comes of his own accord. God is a happening,
it is not something that you have to do. You have to allow it, that’s
all. You have to become available, open – and he starts descending, he
starts rising, he surrounds you from all nooks and corners, he
overfloods you and he starts overflowing from you.</p><p><br></p><p>This is my experience, this can be your experience too. Sanai is
speaking out of his experience; these are not the words of a
philosopher, these are the pregnant messages of a mystic.</p><p><br></p><p>IN THIS HALT OF BUT A WEEK, TO BE IS NOT TO BE,</p><p>AND TO COME IS TO GO.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t become too attached to things here, because it is only a
question of a week. Whether seven days or seventy years, it doesn’t
matter: soon you will be gone, and all that you have accumulated will be
lost. You come empty-handed, you will go empty-handed. Can’t you live
empty-handed? If you can live empty-handed, God is all yours.</p><p>And by living empty-handed I don’t mean that you have to go to the
Himalayas. It is only an awareness. You live as you live, you just
change the attitude. I am not saying renounce the world; it is HIS world
– if you renounce it, it is insulting to God. I am not saying renounce
your family; it is HIS family – if you renounce it, you are behaving
badly towards God.</p><p><br></p><p>Then what has to be done? Live in the world and yet not be part of
it. Remain empty inside, continuously remembering that your
consciousness is a pure mirror. In that awareness, God happens. God is a
happening.</p><p><br></p><p>AND DOES THE SUN EXIST FOR THE COCK TO CROW AT? WHAT IS IT TO HIM</p><p>WHETHER YOU ARE THERE OR NOT? MANY HAVE COME, JUST LIKE YOU, TO HIS
DOOR.</p><p>And don’t brag about your religiousness. Don’t brag about your
disciplines, don’t brag that you have done this for God and that for
God. Love never brags, love does things for the sheer joy of it. You do
whatsoever is natural to you, for the sheer joy of it. If you want to
paint, paint; if you want to sing, sing; if you want to sculpt, sculpt.
Whatsoever you feel like doing, do – but remember, you are not the doer,
he is the doer. Let him take possession of you.</p><p><br></p><p>You disappear. Let him act through you, and then each act becomes so
beautiful, so incredibly beautiful, that you cannot imagine. Then
whatsoever you do is holy.</p><p><br></p><p>YOU WON’T FIND YOUR WAY</p><p><br></p><p>IN THIS STREET; IF THERE IS A WAY, IT IS ON YOU ROAD OF SIGHS.</p><p>ALL OF YOU ARE FAR</p><p><br></p><p>FROM THE ROAD OF DEVOTION:</p><p><br></p><p>SOMETIMES YOU ARE VIRTUOUS, SOMETIMES YOU ARE WICKED:</p><p>SO YOU HOPE FOR YOURSELVES, FEAR FOR YOURSELVES; BUT WHEN YOUR MASK
OF WISDOM AND FOLLY</p><p>AT LAST TURNS WHITE, YOU WILL SEE THAT HOPE AND FEAR ARE ONE.</p><p>You won’t find your way in this street. What street? The street of
duality: the street of hope and fear, the street of love and hate, the
street of darkness and light, the street of the Hindu and the
Mohammedan. You will not find God on this street; he does not exist in
duality. He is prior to duality, he is before the bifurcation happens.
Then where will you find him?</p><p><br></p><p>... IF THERE IS A WAY, says Sanai, IT IS ON YOUR ROAD OF SIGHS.</p><p>Tears. Tears of love, sighs of the heart. It is not on the street of
the head but on the street of the heart. Sufism proposes a
heart-wakefulness: become loving and aware in your heart. Sufism is the
path of love.</p><p><br></p><p>ALL OF YOU ARE FAR</p><p><br></p><p>FROM THE ROAD OF DEVOTION...</p><p><br></p><p>Buddhism is the path of meditation, Zen is meditation. Sufism is the
path of love, Sufism is love. And there are only two ways to reach him:
either through meditation or through love. And they both meet at the
peak, they both become one at the peak. If you attain to one, the other
is attained just as part of it; it is only a question of emphasis.</p><p><br></p><p>If you become meditative you will be surprised: after meditation,
love comes of its own accord. If you love, you will be surprised again:
meditation comes just as a shadow behind it.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is the heart of meditation, meditation is the heart of love.
They are together, two names for the same phenomenon. The approaches are
different, but the same peak, the same climax, is attained. A few people
will find it easy to follow the path of meditation – in fact fifty
percent of people in the world will find it easy to follow the path of
meditation: Zen is their way. And fifty percent will find love closer to
their being: Sufism is their way.</p><p><br></p><p>In a real world, an intelligent world, there will be only two paths,
Sufism and Zen, and all else will disappear. All else is futile. Why
two? Because there are men and there are women. And remember, by “men” I
don’t mean biological men, because there are women who are
psychologically men, and there are men who are psychologically women. I
mean psychological men and women. There are men who are more capable of
love than any woman, but they are few. There are a few women who are
more capable of meditation than any man, but they are few. The majority
of women will have to follow Sufism, and the majority of men will have
to follow Zen. But biologically it cannot be determined; it is a totally
different affair. You have to watch yourself: whichever feels good for
you, whichever feels natural, spontaneous, that is your path.</p><p>Sanai has the heart of a woman. All Sufis have the heart of a woman.
ALL OF YOU ARE FAR</p><p>FROM THE ROAD OF DEVOTION:</p><p><br></p><p>SOMETIMES YOU ARE VIRTUOUS, SOMETIMES YOU ARE WICKED...</p><p>But never devoted. Neither is virtue going to help, nor is your
wickedness going to help; that keeps you divided.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard:</p><p><br></p><p>A man was about to make his first parachute jump and was very
nervous. The instructor tried to reassure him that nothing could happen
because first the parachute would open by itself; and if by some remote
possibility it didn’t, then there was a backup parachute he could pull
the string on; and thirdly if both didn’t work he was to call out the
name of the Devil three times.</p><p><br></p><p>To make the story short, he jumped and the first parachute failed to
open, then the second failed to respond, and in desperation he yelled
out “Devil” three times and sure enough a giant hand appeared under him
and gently carried him to earth and placed him on the ground. He fell to
his knees and in prayer position cried out, “Thank God!”</p><p><br></p><p>Whereupon the giant hand reached over and crushed him to death.</p><p><br></p><p>God or the Devil, it is again the same duality, and the duality is
going to crush you. Virtue or wickedness, it is the same duality, and
the duality is going to crush you.</p><p><br></p><p>God is not your God, because your God is something against the Devil.
God is something beyond your God and Devil: God is transcendental, God
is a transcendence. This transcendence is possible, easily possible; it
is not arduous either. Let me remind you again: just change your gestalt
from the contents to the consciousness, from the mind to the space in
which the mind exists.</p><p><br></p><p>There are clouds in the sky: you can see the clouds, then you forget
the sky. Change your gestalt: see the sky and forget the clouds. That
brings transformation.</p><p><br></p><p>The sky is your consciousness, and your thoughts, your desires, are
nothing but clouds; they come and go. They don’t touch your sky at all,
your sky remains virgin. You are pure from eternity, and you will remain
pure to eternity. Purity is your nature. To recognize this, to realize
this, is to become enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>And keep the fire of discontent burning. Unless you have become
enlightened, don’t leave any stone unturned. You have to become that
which you are, because only then is there bliss and only then is there
freedom and only then is there benediction.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

BELOVED MASTER, WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR?
Deva Parmita, man is a search for the self – not for A self but for THE self. Man is constantly seeking the lost paradise: somewhere deep in the recesses of human beings, the nostalgia persists.

Man is constantly seeking the lost paradise: somewhere deep in the recesses of human beings, the nostalgia persists. We have known something that is only a far faraway memory, The memory is not even conscious; we have lost all track of it, where it is. But the fragrance goes on arising.\nHence religion is not an accidental phenomenon. It is not going to disappear from the world; no communism, no fascism can make it disappear. Religion is going to remain, because it is very essential. Unless a man surpasses humanity, unless a man becomes a Buddha, religion remains relevant. Only for a Buddha is religion irrelevant. He has arrived: now there is no need for any search.\nParmita, there are not different searches for different human beings. The search is singular, it is one, it is universal. The search is for the self, the supreme self. One wants to know, “Who am I?” because everything else is secondary. Without knowing oneself, whatsoever one is doing is pointless. Unless I know exactly who I am, my whole life is going to remain futile. It will not bring fruition, it will not bring flowering, it will not bring fulfillment.\nThe first step has to be that of self-knowledge. But the paradox is that if you start searching for A self you will miss THE self. By “a self” I mean the ego, the process of egoing. That is a false\nself: because we cannot find the true, we start creating the false, just to console ourselves. It is a substitute. But the substitute can never become the truth, and the substitute becomes a bondage.\nTruth liberates. Substitutes for truth create prisons. The ego is the greatest prison that man has yet invented; you are all feeling suffocated, crushed. It is not that somebody else is doing it to you: you are the doer of it. You have taken a wrong step. Rather than searching for that which is, you have started substituting something for it – a toy, a pseudo thing. It may console you, but it cannot bring celebration to your life. And all consolation is suicidal, because while you remain consoled, time goes on slipping out of your hands.\nTHE self is not A self. The self is exactly a no-self: there is no idea of ‘I’ in it, it is universal. All ideas arise in it, but it cannot be identified with any idea that arises in it. All ideas arise in it, all ideas dissolve in it. It is the sky, the context of all contexts, it is the space in which everything happens. But the space itself never happens – it abides, it is always there, and because it is always there, it is easy to miss it. Because it is so much there and always there, you never become aware of its presence.\nIt is like the air: you don’t become aware of its presence. It is like the ocean that surrounds the fish: the fish never becomes aware of it. It is like the pressure of the air: the pressure is so much, it has always been there, but you are not aware of it. It is like gravitation: it is so much, but you are not aware of it. It is like the earth rushing with great speed round and round the sun: the earth is a spaceship, but nobody is aware of it. We are aboard a spaceship, and it is going at a great speed. Still we are not aware of it.\nAwareness needs some gaps. When there are no gaps you fall asleep; you cannot remain aware.\nIf one has always been healthy, one will not be aware of health. Awareness needs gaps – sometimes you should not be healthy. You should fall ill, then you can have a sense of health. If there was no darkness in the world and there was only light, nobody would have ever known light; people would have missed it.\nThat’s how we go on missing the original self – you can call it God or nirvana, it doesn’t matter. Sufis have two beautiful words. One is FANA: FANA means dissolving the ego, dissolving the false substitute. And the other word is BAQA: BAQA means the arrival, the arising, of the real self.\nThe real self is universal. How to find it? It is not far away, so you are not to make a long journey to it. It is so close that no journey is needed at all. It is within you. Rather than journeying, you will have to learn how to sit silently.\nThat’s what meditation is all about – just sitting silently doing nothing. Thoughts arise: you watch. Desires arise: you watch. But you remain the watcher. You don’t become a victim of the desires and the thoughts that are arising; you remain a watcher. You remain the context of all contexts, you remain the space before which everything appears. But the space never appears before itself – it cannot, it is impossible.\nThe mirror cannot mirror itself, the eyes cannot see themselves. I cannot catch hold of my hand with the same hand; it is impossible.\nThis is the most fundamental thing to remember, Parmita. You are the watcher and never the watched, you are the observer and never the observed, you are the witness and never the witnessed. You are pure subjectivity. You never appear as an object – how can you appear as an object in front of yourself? Whatsoever appears in front of you is not you.\nGo on eliminating the contents. Go on saying, “NETI NETI, I am not this, I am not this.” Go on eliminating, and a moment comes when there is nothing left to eliminate. There is pure silence: no content moves in front of you, the mirror reflects nothing. That is the moment when self-knowing arises in you. You become illumined, you are enlightened.\nSo these few fundamentals are to be remembered: the self is a no-self. The self is not personal, it is universal. The self is the space or context in which all “positionality” in life appears, occurs, arises. It is the screen of life, but the screen itself never appears on the screen, it cannot. Everything else appears on it, it itself remains hidden. It is pure subjectivity.\nThis pure subjectivity is the ultimate goal everybody is searching for. But it seems difficult. We are so prone to become identified with the contents. So rather than searching for the real, we create something unreal, which is easy. The artificial is always easy, you can manufacture it.\nYour ego is a manufactured phenomenon. And once you have manufactured the ego... How is the ego manufactured? “I am a Hindu”: now you are on the way to creating an ego. “I am beautiful, I am intelligent, I am this, I am that” – you are bringing more and more bricks to make the prison called ego.\nAnd this is what we go on doing in our whole life. Earn more money, have a bigger bank balance, and your ego will feel more grounded, more supported, more secure. Become famous: the more people know about you, the more you will think you are.\nHence the constant search for attention. If nobody pays any attention to you, you are reduced to nothing. If you move on the street and nobody says hello, people go on passing by, not even taking any note of you, suddenly you start feeling the earth disappearing underneath your feet.\nWhat has happened? They are not feeding your ego. But people feed each other’s egos, because that’s how THEY can be fed. Somebody says, “How are you?” He is really saying, “Ask ME, ‘How are you?’” He is simply asking for mutual gratification. And people do gratify each other; we support each other’s egos: somebody praises you, you praise him in return.\nThat’s what we call society. It depends on mutual satisfactions, and the greatest satisfaction seems to be ego-gratification.\nHence people are interested so much in politics, because politics can gratify you as nothing else can. If you become politically powerful the whole country is in your grip; the whole country has to pay attention to you. You can impose your will on people, you have power.\nThe power of a politician is the power of violence. Now he controls the whole mechanism of violence: he controls the police, the government, the military, he controls everything. He can impose his will on you. That’s why politicians tend to become violent sooner or later. Politicians hanker deep down\nfor wars, because it is only in war that a politician becomes a GREAT politician. If you go through history you will see the point.\nWinston Churchill would not have been such a great leader if there had been no second world war. Neither would Adolf Hitler have been such a power if there had been no second world war, not would Mussolini. The war created the context: they were able to be as violent as possible. They were able to butcher people, to murder people, in millions.\nPeople immediately pay attention when you are violent. If you live a peaceful life, no newspaper is going to report about you in your whole life. But if you kill somebody or you commit suicide, you will be immediately in the newspapers.\nJust a few days ago, Reverend Jones committed suicide with all of his nine hundred disciples. You had never heard about this poor man before, nobody knew that there was anybody like that. Now the whole world knows.\nThey had lived in that commune for many years, but nobody would take any note of them. It is possible that had you taken note of them, they might not have needed to go to such an extreme, they might not have committed suicide. This is his way of making the whole world feel his presence – this is a very pathological way, ugly, but this is the same phenomenon again. People are searching for the ego: if they cannot find it through being creative, they will find it through being destructive. If they cannot find it by being a great saint, they will find it by being a great sinner.\nSomebody asked George Bernard Shaw, “Where would you like to go when you die – to heaven or to hell?” He said, “It all depends.”\nThe man said, “What do you mean, ‘It all depends’?”\nHe said, “If I am going to be the first in heaven, then to heaven. If I am going to be second there, no. Then it is better to be in hell but be first.”\nHe is joking, but he is telling a truth – a truth about you, a truth about the whole humanity, the way it lives through ambition, through egoing.\nRemember, the real self has nothing to do with anybody else paying attention to you. Note the difference: the false self needs others’ attention to be paid to you, and the real self only needs your attention – just your attention, and that’s enough.\nIf you turn your attention inwards, you will know the real self. If you go on seeking others’ attention, you will continuously live in a false entity which is always ready to disappear if you don’t feed it continuously. It has to be supported.\nThe ego is not an entity. It is not a noun, it is a verb. That’s why I am saying it is egoing. You cannot remain satisfied with any attention paid to you, you have to ask and hanker for more. You have to go on egoing; it is only through egoing that the ego can exist. It is a process – and it is so false and its demands are so ugly! It is a lie. It demands more and more lies from you, and to gratify it you have to become utterly false. You have to become a personality.\nA personality means a false phenomenon, a mask. You have to become an actor; you are no longer a real person, you are no longer authentic. You don’t have any substance, you are just a shadow. And because of this shadow there is always fear of death, because any moment this shadow can disappear.\nYour bank can go bankrupt, and immediately you are gone, you are nobody. Your power can be lost, because there are other competitors pushing you. This whole life is a constant pushing and pulling, hence there is so much agony.\nDo you know the root of the word agony? It comes from ‘ag’: ag means pushing. You are continuously being pushed, and in your turn you are pushing others; that creates agony.\nThe whole world lives in anguish and agony. Only the person who comes to know his real self goes beyond it and enters into the world of ecstasy. And there are the two states: agony and ecstasy.\nParmita, you are in agony, as everybody else is. And the search is for ecstasy. Remember always, your commitments, your ideologies, your so-called ultimate values, your theologies, philosophies and religions provide contexts, often valuable contexts, for individual existence. But they are not what you are.\nYou are not even your body. You are not your mind. You are neither black nor white, you are neither Indian nor German. You cannot be defined in any way, all definitions will fall short. You are indefinable; you are something that surpasses all definitions. You are the vast sky in which planets appear and earths appear, and sun and moon and stars – and they all disappear, and the sky remains as it has remained always. The sky knows no change. You are that unchanging sky. Clouds come and go, you are always here.\nWhen Raman Maharshi was dying, somebody asked, “Bhagwan, soon you will be leaving your body; where will you go?” He opened his eyes, laughed and said, “Where can I go? I have been here, I will be here. Where can I go – WHERE? There is nowhere to go. I am everywhere: I have been here and I will remain here for ever and ever.”\nHe is saying that he has come to know his being as the sky; he is no longer a cloud.\nIf you really want to search for the real self, don’t get attached to any commitment, to any program, to any idea. Remain unattached, flexible, fluid; don’t become stagnant. Always remain in a state of unfrozenness; don’t freeze. The moment you freeze, you have something ale in our hands; a cloud has arisen. Remain in a state of meltedness, don’t become committed to any form or name. And then something tremendous starts happening to you: for the first time you start feeling who you are. The feeling does not come from the outside, it arises from the inner depths of your being. It floods you. It is light, utter light, it is bliss, utter bliss. It is divine. It is another name for God.\nNever become crystallized; if you become crystallized in something, you are encaged. Remain free, remain freedom. All identity creates fixation; and every fixation, every identification, is a liability. The more fixed one’s identity, the less the experience of which one is capable. The point is not to lack a position, but not to be positional.\nI am not saying to become unthinking. Remain intelligent, capable of thinking, but never get identified with any thought. Use the thought as a tool, as an instrument; remember that you are the master. Not to be attached to whatever position one has at any particular moment is the beginning of self- knowledge. One IS, one experiences aliveness, to the extent to which one can transcend particular positions and can assume other viewpoints.\nThat’s what I mean by remaining fluid, flowing. One should remain available to the present. Die to the past each moment, so that nothing about you remains fixed. Don’t carry a character around yourself; all characters are armors, imprisonments.\nThe real man of character is characterless – you will be surprised by this. The real man of character is characterless: he has consciousness, but he has no character. He lives moment to moment. Responsible he is, but he responds out of the moment, not out of past contexts. He carries no ready-made programs in his being. The more you have ready-made programs, the more you are an ego. When you have none – no programs, nothing ready-made in you – when each moment you are as fresh as if you are born anew, to me that is freedom. And only a free consciousness can know the true self.\nThis is the search, Parmita. Nothing else will ever satisfy, nothing else can ever satisfy. All are consolations – and it is better to drop them, it is better to become aware that consolations are not going to help.\nThis is what I call sannyas: dropping consolations, renouncing consolations – not the world but consolations – renouncing all that is false, becoming true, becoming simple, natural, spontaneous. That’s my vision of a sannyasin, the vision of total freedom.\nAnd in those beautiful moments of total freedom, the first rays of light enter you, the first glimpses of who you are. And the grandeur of it is such, and the splendor of it is such, that you will be surprised to find that you have been carrying the kingdom of God within you and you have remained so unaware, and for so long. You will be surprised that it was possible not to know such a treasure. Such an inexhaustible treasure is within you.\nJesus goes on repeating again and again, “The kingdom of God is within you.” Call it the kingdom of God or the supreme self or nirvana or whatever you will, that is our search – everyone’s, not only of human beings but of all beings. Even trees are growing towards it, even birds are searching for it, even rivers are rushing towards it. The whole existence is an adventure.\nAnd that is the beauty of this existence. If it was not an adventure, life would be absolute boredom. Life is a celebration because it is an adventure.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2\nHOW DID I GET SO LUCKY TO FALL IN THE GRACE OF YOUR LOVE IN THESE TIMES OF SUCH CONFUSION IN THE WORLD?\nPrem Debal, the times of confusion and chaos are the greatest times to live in. When the society is static there is not much to live for, to live with. When a society is secure and there is no confusion and there is no chaos, then people live a dull, drab, dragging life – comfortable, convenient, stable, but not alive.\nIt is only in the times of chaos and confusion that great things happen, because people are loose. They are loose, uprooted: they can search for new soils, they can search for new lands, they can search for new countries, they can search for new continents of being.\nThis is one of the greatest moments in the history of human consciousness. It has never been so; this is a crescendo.\nBuddha said – and he seems to have detected it richly – that after each twenty-five centuries there comes a moment of great turmoil and chaos. And that is the time when the greatest number of people become enlightened.\nNow twenty-five centuries have passed since Buddha. Again you are coming closer and closer to a moment where the past will lose all meaning. When the past loses ll meaning, you are free, you are untethered from the past: you can use this freedom to grow tremendously, to grow to undreamed-of heights.\nBut you can destroy yourself too. If you are not intelligent, the confusion, the chaos, will destroy you. Millions will be destroyed – because of their unintelligence, not because of the chaos. They will be destroyed because they will not be able to find a secure and comfortable and convenient life, as was possible in the past. They will not be able to find where they belong. They will have to live from their own sources; they will have to be individuals, they will have to be rebels.\nThe society is disappearing, the family is disappearing; now it is very difficult. Unless you are capable of being an individual it is going to be difficult to live. Only individuals will survive.\nNow people who have become too accustomed to slavery, accustomed to being commanded, accustomed to being ordered by somebody else – people who have become too much accustomed to father-figures – they will be in a state of insanity. But that is their fault, it is not the fault of the times. The times are beautiful, because the times of chaos are the times of revolution.\nIt is possible now to get out of the wheel of life and death more easily than it has been possible for twenty-five centuries since Buddha. In Buddha’s time, many people became enlightened; the society was in a turmoil. Again it is happening. Great times are ahead – prepare for them.\nAnd that’s what I am trying to do here. Orthodox people cannot understand what is happening here; they have no eyes to see it and no heart to feel it. They only have old rotten values, and they go on judging me according to hose values. Those values are out of date. I am creating new people, I am creating new values, I am creating a new future. They live in the past; they cannot understand the future that I am trying to bring here to the earth.\nMy sannyasins don’t belong to the past, they don’t represent any tradition. They belong to the future: they belong to something that is going to happen and has not yet happened. Hence there are no criteria – they cannot be judged easily, and they will be misunderstood.\nI am going to be misunderstood, because people have their values, and those values come from the past. And I am trying to create a space for the future to happen.\nYou say: HOW DID I GET SO LUCKY TO FALL IN THE GRACE OF YOUR LOVE IN THESE TIMES OF SUCH CONFUSION IN THE WORLD?\nIt is not a question of luck, it is a question of intelligence. That is the only luck in the world – intelligence. And remember, everybody is born with intelligence but people don’t use it, because to be intelligent is to live in danger.\nThe intelligent child will be a constant pain in the neck for the parents; they try to crush his intelligence. Nobody wants an intelligence child, because he creates suspicions in you, he creates doubts in you. An intelligent child asks questions you cannot answer. An intelligent child is a problem for the teachers in the school, in the college, in the university.\nAn intelligent person will always remain a problem, wherever he is. So the society tries in every way to destroy your intelligence.\nI have heard:\nThe teacher told the students that they were going to play a game.\n“I’ve got something behind my back and I’m going to describe it and you guess what it is,” she said. “I’m holding something round and red. Can someone guess?”\n“An apple?” little Herbie said.\n“No,” said the teacher, “but it shows you were thinking. It’s a cherry. Now I’m holding something round and orange. Can you tell me what it is?”\n“An orange?” little Herbie said.\n“No,” said the teacher, “but it shows you were thinking. It’s a peach.” Herbie raised his hand. “Teacher, can I play the game too?”\nThe teacher said, yes, and Herbie went to the back of the room, faced the rear and said, “Teacher, I’m holding something about two inches long with a red tip.”\nThe teacher said, “Herbie!”\n“No,” said little Herbie, “but it shows you were thinking. It’s a match.”\nNow, these intelligent children cannot be allowed to live! Nobody likes an intelligent person. Hence people start playing unintelligent roles in life, because an unintelligent person is accepted everywhere. That’s why millions of people have become mediocre. Nobody is born mediocre, let\nme remind you. God gives intelligence to everybody; just as he gives life to everybody, he gives intelligence. Intelligence is an intrinsic part of life.\nHave you ever seen an unintelligent animal? Have you ever seen an unintelligent bird, an unintelligent tree? Every tree is intelligent enough to find the source of water to send out roots. And you will be surprised, scientists are very much surprised, at how trees find places.\nWhen a tree starts sending out its roots, sometimes it sends them hundreds of feet away in a particular direction to where water is. Now, how does it find it? The water is a hundred feet away towards the north: it does not send its roots towards the south, it sends its roots towards the north – a hundred feet away! and not only to natural water sources – sometimes it sends its roots to the pipes, corporation pipes, hundreds of feet away; it detects them. It takes YEARS for it to send out those roots. It lives, in its own way, an intelligent life.\nIf there is too much competition, trees grow higher; they have to. That’s why in the jungles of Africa, trees grow very high. The same trees in India won’t grow that high; there is no need, the competition is not so much. In thick forests if the tree remains small it will die; it will be in the shadow of other trees. It has to reach the sun: it goes on and on moving upwards.\nTrees are intelligent in their own way, birds are intelligent in their own way, animals are intelligent in their own way. And so is man.\nYou will find the mediocre and the stupid only in human beings. I have never come across a stupid dog – I have tried – but there are millions of stupid human beings. What has happened to human beings? Intelligence is not allowed.\nThe whole society and the pattern of the society is against intelligence; it supports mediocre people. Everybody is happy with a mediocre person, because whenever you are around a mediocre person he is never a problem; he is always ready to be obedient, and he always gives you a feeling that you are superior.\nIf people live intelligently, everybody will be lucky. If you are not lucky, it is not that God has been unfair to you, it is only because you have compromised with the society.\nDebal, you could come to me because you have been courageous enough to use your intelligence. It is not a question of luck, it is only a question of guts, courage. And these days are really beautiful, fantastic. Use these days, these times: you can soar high, higher than has ever been possible before.\nMillions of people are in the situation now where enlightenment can happen. We can defeat Buddha for the first time. The times are very favorable, because there is so much chaos and so much confusion, and all the old ideologies are dead and dying of their own accord. Man is becoming free, coming out of his shell.\nThe third question: Question 3\nBELOVED MASTER, I HAVE BEEN TO MANY GURUS BUT I HAVE NOT CHANGED A BIT. WHY?\nTo expect that just by being to many gurus you will be transformed is foolish. Nobody can transform you. The very idea, the very expectation that somebody else is going to transform you, keeps you unintelligent. When are you going to declare the mastery of your own being? When are you going to take the reins in your own hands? When are you going to say, “I will now live according to myself”?\nAnd those so-called gurus you have been to will make you more and more mediocre and stupid. They want you obedience – and only stupid people can be obedient. They will not help you to become more intelligent.\nIt is very rare to find a master. Out of a hundred, ninety-nine are bogus, and the one who is not bogus will demand so much from you. First he will demand intelligence – and you have completely forgotten that you have that t all in the first place. He will demand awareness.\nThe false gurus, the false so-called masters, provide you with better sleeping-pills. They provide you with psychological strategies to remain comfortably asleep, they give you lullabies, so that you can live a drugged life. Their methods are nothing but psychological tranquilizers, non-medicinal tranquilizers. So for a few days you feel god, you repeat a certain mantra and you feel good, and then you become fed up and you start seeing the point that it is not leading you anywhere. Then you go to another guru, he gives you some other method, for a few days again the honeymoon, and then that disappears.\nBut one thing you should be thankful for: it is because of all those gurus that you have come here. And now you cannot goof off; it is impossible.\nI don’t give you any lullaby, I will give you electric shocks – because that is the only way you can come out of your drugged state.\nTwo drunks were sitting in a bar, thinking of things to do to pass the time. “Let’s play television,” said one.\n“Okay,” said the other. “How?”\n“I make believe I’m a great big TV star and you guess who I am.”\n“All right,” said the first. “I’m five-foot-four, got blonde hair, blue eyes, I’m 38-24-36 and I’m beautiful.” The second drunk stared at him for a moment. “Never mind who you are,” he said, “Kish me.”\nThis is your state. You have to be shocked, you have to be brought to consciousness. Hence I don’t provide you with any consolations – you would like them, you would love them.\nSo those who come here for consolations can have no understanding of what is happening here. And you can go and on, from one school to another school, from one guru to another guru; that is not going to change you at all. It is not a question of traveling from one place to another place;\nyou will remain that which you are. Only if you are shocked, only if somebody is there who can destroy you, who can destroy you as you are, only then will your real being come out. The unreal has become a thick foliage around you.\nA Hindu can become a Christian; nothing will change. Instead of Krishna he will start torturing Christ, that’s all. A Jew can become a Hindu; that will not help either. You go on changing your masks, your garments, but the change is needed somewhere deep in your being – not on the periphery but at the core.\nMorgenstern lived in difficult times. Life was hard, especially if you were a Jew. So he decided to become a Roman Catholic and was baptized.\nThe first time he went to confession, he stole the parish priest’s gold watch! But he was honest, and so he immediately confessed:\n“Father, I have stolen an expensive watch and now I feel very guilty about it. I confess that what I did was immoral and totally wrong. Please, Father, may I give you the watch?”\nThe priest was surprised but shook his head. “No, I couldn’t possibly accept it.”\nMorgenstern insisted. “Please, Father, I feel so guilty, won’t you please accept the watch as a sign of my repentance?”\n“That isn’t possible, my son,” said the priest, moved by Morgenstern’s deep sincerity. “You must return the watch to its original owner.”\n“Ahh!” said Morgenstern with a deep sigh. “I’ve tried, Father, I swear I’ve tried, but I’m afraid the good man doesn’t want it.”\n“In that case, my son,” said the priest, “I see nothing wrong with your keeping the watch, and since you’ve now confessed, there’s no need at all anymore for you to feel guilty!”\nYou see the Jewish mind?\nYou can go on changing your religion, you can go on changing your philosophy – these are really ways to avoid the real change. The real change has to happen deep down in you. You are unconscious, and the only change that is going to help is to become conscious. You are living mechanically: the only thing that can help is to live life non-mechanically. De-automatize yourself, de-hypnotize yourself.\nThe society has hypnotized you. The society has dulled your senses, it has poisoned you. It wants skillful efficient machines; it does not want men. It has reduced you to a machine. You are a good clerk or a good soldier or a good stationmaster or a good deputy collector – it has reduced you to something which has a utility. It has made you a commodity. It does not want your intelligence, your awareness. You will have to rebel against it.\nAnd the gurus you have been to are nothing but agents of the same society. Hence the society respects them, hence the society supports them.\nI cannot be supported by the society. It is a sheer miracle that I am existing, it is very illogical. I should not be here at all. The society does not support me, it cannot support me. In every possible way it will create – it IS creating – hindrances for my work.\nJust the other day I was reading in the newspapers, one man has suggested to the government that I should be expelled from India. He must be a very religious man, because he says I am destroying religion. And he is not satisfied with just my expulsion – he then suggests my tongue should be cut out, so that I cannot speak; and my hands should also be cut off, so that I cannot write. And he thinks he is a religious man.\nBut that’s what people have always done. They crucified Jesus, and they were thinking they were doing something very religious. They murdered the great Sufi master, al-Hillaj Mansoor, in exactly the same way. This man who has suggested this to the government may have been part of the crowd who killed Mansoor, because this was the way: his hands were cut off, his tongue was cut out, then his head was cut off. It seems the society goes on perpetuating its old stupidities. And he is thinking that he is suggesting this to protect religion, that religion is in danger – because of me, religion is in danger.\nReligion is not in danger because of me, but pseudo-religion certainly is in danger. And the society needs pseudo-religions so that the real religion can be avoided, because real religion always creates trouble.\nA Buddha, a Jesus, a Mansoor, a Sanai – whenever these people walk on the earth they create fire, they create revolution. They start transforming people, transforming their unconsciousness into consciousness. And then there is trouble.\nIt happens every day here: a couple comes here, and within seven days they have separated. Now, what has happened? And they had lived for twenty years together! For twenty years they were compromising and compromising and compromising. For twenty years they were suffering; they were miserable together. But they were carrying on somehow in a state of unconsciousness.\nThe moment they are here, they start meditating. They go into a few therapy groups, and they become alert and they say, what have they been doing? The man comes to see that he has never loved this woman, he has been deceiving – he has been deceiving the woman, he has been deceiving himself. The woman comes to see that she has never loved this man; this man seems to be a stranger, she does not know who he is. And why have they been living together and torturing each other? Suddenly they are awake and the marriage has gone to the dogs.\nPeople will be afraid of such a place: their marriage may disappear, their old ways of living may be shattered. It is ultimately good that something wrong falls down and disappears, but in the beginning it is painful. Twenty years you have lived with a woman: it is difficult to unclinch yourself, it is painful, it is agony.\nBut if you don’t stop a false relationship, you will never be in any true relationship in your life. And a true relationship is a mirror: it helps you to see your face, who you are. But only a true relationship is a mirror. A false relationship is a stone wall; you cannot be mirrored in it, it is utterly futile.\nParents are afraid; they don’t want their children to come here, because I will teach them to be themselves. And if the child wants to be a musician, I will say, “Become a musician, even if you remain a beggar.” And the parents wanted him to become a doctor or an engineer – now there is going to be trouble.\nThe child, if he becomes an engineer, will have much money, prestige, power, but he will miss his soul. He will never come to know any joy in his life; he will know misery, he will never know any rejoicing. But the parents are more interested in money and power and prestige. That’s what has been told to them by their parents; this is their tradition.\nEach generation goes on corrupting the new generation. Each generation goes on loading the new generation with its own diseases, illnesses and pathologies.\nIf you come here, I am going to unburden you of all your pathologies. And they may be very traditional and very long-respected, and your parents may have carried them for thousands of years, but I will teach you to drop all that nonsense, all that rubbish, and simply become your own being, your own self. Now, the society cannot tolerate it. The society is bound to be inimical, antagonistic towards me. This has always been so.\nYou must have gone to the gurus who are agents of the same rotten society. How can they help you to change? They are there to protect the society. The society gives them respect, that is how the society goes on paying them for their services.\nYour teachers are in the service of the past. Your priests are in the service of the past, your politicians are in the service of the past. And I want you to become aware of the present.\nIf you have some courage in your heart, and you don’t escape from this surgical energy-field, you will be transformed. And remember, I will not transform you, I can only create situations in which you can transform yourself. I am simply creating a field in which things can happen – they are happening. Now don’t escape from here. Just a few months, and then you cannot escape!\nThe fourth question:\nQuestion 4\nWHY ARE YOU SO MUCH AGAINST ASCETICISM? ISN’T ASCETICISM A VALID PATH TO GOD?\nPath? It is a pathology. To be an ascetic simply shows that you are masochistic, that you are suicidal, that you enjoy torturing yourself. And by torturing yourself you can create a certain character, but the character will be only on the surface. It will not transform you, it will only be a pretension. It will be only a face, a facade, a camouflage.\nAscetics have existed in the world because there are suicidal people. And there is a death instinct in man – Sigmund Freud has called it “thanatos.” Sigmund Freud’s contribution to human growth is immense. In his early life he discovered the life-instinct – sex, eros. And then in his later life, when he was getting old, he discovered another thing – thanatos, against eros.\nThere are two basic instincts in man: one is to live, another is to die. Both are there. If the instinct to live is not supported, the other instinct becomes powerful. If the instinct to live is supported, if life is affirmed, then the other instinct disappears. It is the same energy – either it will flow through eros, or it will flow through thanatos. It depends on you.\nThe religions of the world up to now have been death-oriented. And remember, when I say “religions” I don’t include Buddhas. I don’t include Bahauddin, Sanai, Attar, Mahavira, Jesus, Mohammed, no. But I include Mohammedanism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, Jainism, Buddhism. All the organized religions of the world have been death-oriented. And this is something unbelievable: all the original beings were life-oriented.\nBuddha is utterly life-oriented, but Buddhism is death-oriented. Mohammed is life-oriented, but Mohammedanism is death-oriented. How does it happen?\nJust the other day, I was saying that truth transferred from one to another becomes a lie; it goes upside down. When Buddha says something, he means something totally different than that which is understood by the blind and unconscious people. Everything goes topsy-turvy. His life-affirmation becomes death-affirmation in the disciples. This has been a constant problem. Up to now it has not been possible to transfer truth, and I don’t think it will ever be possible to transfer it. Because the Buddha speaks from the peak of the Himalayas and you listen in the dark valley. By the time it reaches to you, by the time you have interpreted it, it has already gone sour, bitter; it is no more the same truth.\nSo all the original religious founders were life-affirmative. And all the religions that were born out of their teachings became death-oriented.\nAsceticism is falling in love with death. It is a pathology, it is not a path. But people respect it, because the ascetic seems so different from you. You love food, he hates food. you love a good bath, he hates to take a bath. Jaina monks don’t take baths – not only that, they don’t clean their teeth either. They are against the body.\nYou love comforts, the ascetic loves discomfort. He is not at ease with comfort, he is at ease only when he is uncomfortable. You call it a path? It is a pathology. The man who is standing on his head, and feels comfortable only when he stands on his head, is ill, is abnormal.\nAll the animals laugh about it. Whenever animals see a yogi standing on his head, they laugh. They cannot believe what has happened to this man. People go on torturing their bodies, twisting their bodies.\nI have heard:\nReggie owned an elephant, but the cost of feeding it was getting out of hand. Then he go an idea. He had seen elephants lift one leg, and even two legs. Once in a circus he’d even seen an elephant lift three legs in the air and stand on just one.\nSo Reggie announced to the world that he’d pay ten thousand dollars to anyone who could make his elephant stand in the air on no legs. However, each person who wanted to try would have to pay a hundred dollars.\nPeople came from near and far. They tried everything from coaxing to hypnotism, but no one could make the elephant rise up in the air.\nThen one day a blue convertible drove up and a little man got out and addressed Reggie: “Is it true that you’ll pay ten thousand dollars if I make your elephant get off all four legs?”\n“Yes,” Reggie said. “But you’ve got to pay one hundred dollars to try.”\nThe little man handed Reggie a hundred-dollar bill. Then he went back to the car and took out a metal club. He walked up to the elephant and looked him in the eye. Then he walked behind the elephant and swung hard, hitting the elephant smack on the balls. The elephant let out a roar and flew up into the air.\nAfter the little man had collected his ten thousand dollars, Reggie was very depressed. He’d only taken in eight thousand dollars and now he’d not only lost a couple of grand but still had the problem of feeding and housing the elephant.\nSuddenly Reggie got another inspiration. He knew that elephants could move their heads up and down, but he had never seen one move from side to side. So he announced that he would pay ten thousand dollars to anyone who could make his elephant move his head from side to side. However, each person who wanted to try would have to pay one hundred dollars.\nPeople came from near and far. They paid their hundred and they tried, but of course none succeeded.\nThen just when things were going well, a familiar blue convertible drove up and the little man came out. He addressed Reggie: “Is it true that you’ll pay me ten thousand dollars if I can make your elephant move his head from side to side?”\n“Yes,” said Reggie. “But you’ve got to pay a hundred dollars to try.”\nThe little man handed Reggie the hundred dollars. Then he returned to his car and took out his metal club. He walked up to the elephant.\n“Do you remember me?” he asked.\nThe elephant nodded by shaking his head up and down. “Do you want me to do it again?”\nThe elephant quickly shook his head – no.\nEven elephants understand it – but man is such a fool. Asceticism a path? It is a pathology.\nLife has to be lived in its totality. Your energies have to flow through eros: eros is life, love is life. And whenever your energy is flowing against love, against life, beware: you are falling astray, you are going away from God. God is life, God is eros.\nNow see the point: all the ascetic people and all the ascetic schools are against love, against sex, against life, against food – against living a healthy life of rejoicing.\nThat’s why they are so much against me – because I would like you to live fully, totally, wholly. I would like you to accept life without denying yourself anything, without feeling in any way guilty. All guilt is a cunning strategy of the priests to divert your energy from life towards death.\nWhy have people done it? There are reasons. The politician wants people not to love life too much – because if people love life too much then people cannot be forced to go to wars. Who wants to die? There would be no army left in the world. People have to be forced against eros, they have to be forced against life, they have to be taught to love death, respect death and feel death as sacred – only then can there be armies. And great armies are needed. The politician is against love, against life, because he needs soldiers for death, to die and to kill.\nThe priest also wants people not to love life. If they love life they will not bother about the temples and the churches and the mosques. And if they really love life they will find God through life – the priest will not be needed. The priest is needed only when people have gone astray from life – only then can he become the guide and can he tell them, “Now I will lead you to the right path.” First they have to be helped to go astray, then the guides come.\nFirst people have to be made ill, then you can sell medicine. Otherwise you cannot sell medicine. If everybody is healthy, who will go to the physician and who will go to the druggist? And who will be able to sell medicine to people? It will be impossible. People have to be ill, only then can factories and factories of medicine go on manufacturing new drugs.\nThe priest needs people to go away from life. The moment they go away from life, they go away from God. Then there is a need for the priest and the temple and the church and the organization and the organized religion. The people would like to be Christians and Hindus and Mohammedans.\nOtherwise life is so tremendously satisfying – who bothers? Who cares?\nReverend Jones was able to kill nine hundred people, innocent people, for a simple reason: he was training them for death. You will be surprised to know that in Jonestown, lovemaking among the members of the sect was not allowed. Celibacy was enforced. There were hard strict rules: the people were not allowed to go outside the commune, no contact with outsiders was allowed. They were living in isolation, they were all ascetics.\nAnd it is because of this asceticism that they were ready to commit suicide. Now people are searching for the causes. Somebody thinks that he hypnotized people, somebody thinks something else – a thousand and one reasons are being found. The simple reason is, he diverted their eros – that’s all. And eros can be diverted very easily.\nDown the ages, religious people have been doing the same. He did it to the logical end. Ordinarily monks die slowly; they commit a slow suicide. He went fast and quickly. But there was a tendency, an atmosphere of death. They were practising death almost every month. Every month he would call the commune together and order them to die. And they were ready. They had said yes so many times that when it was really asked they could not say no. It had become an inbuilt program.\nAnd their life was so ugly, that’s why they were ready to die.\nI have always loved a certain story. An English diplomat went to see Adolf Hitler before the second world war. They were standing on the terrace of a three-storey building, talking. Just to show his power to the English diplomat, Hitler ordered one soldier to jump. The soldier immediately jumped, fell on the road and died.\nThe English diplomat was very much shaken. And Adolf Hitler laughed and said, “My whole country is ready to follow my orders in this way.” To emphasize it more, he ordered another soldier to jump. And before the English diplomat could prevent him, he also jumped. To make the thing absolutely clear, he ordered a third soldier – but before he could jump, the English diplomat caught hold of him and said, “Are you mad? What are you doing? Why are you so ready to leave your life?”\nAnd the man said, “Leave me alone! You call this life?”\nTo be with Adolf Hitler is far worse – it is better to die. These people who committed suicide must have been living a worse life than death itself. This is the simple logic of it. And the ascetic attitude makes your life so ugly, so intolerable, that one starts thinking of death as a deliverance.\nI am against ascetic attitudes, because they are ill attitudes, unhealthy, unwholesome. I am all for eros, I am all for life – because life is the temple of God, the only temple. And eros is the only way God is expressed in the world.\nIf you move totally into eros, into love of life, into life-affirmation, into rejoicing, you will find, deep down hidden in life, God himself. Life is his manifestation; he is the hidden source of it. Don’t go away from life – going away is going away from God. Hence my sannyasins are not to renounce but to rejoice.\nNow people have asked me a few questions: “Can the same thing happen here as happened in Reverend Jones’ commune?”\nThis will be the last place in the world where it could happen, because I teach you love, I teach you life. My whole effort is to make your energy move through life totally – nothing is left. And if you move totally through life, death disappears. Even when you die, you will not see that death is happening to you – you will see only that you are changing your abode, you are changing your garments. You are on an eternal pilgrimage.\nI teach you life, I teach you abundant life. This cannot happen here – I am not teaching you suicide. It can happen in any ascetic society, in any ascetic commune. But my commune is not ascetic at all. That’s why Christians are against it, and Hindus are against it, and Jainas are against it, and Mohammedans are against it, and everybody is against it – because they are all death-oriented. And my love is unconditionally for life.\nI teach you to love and to live. Death is impossible here – what to say of suicide? Even death is impossible here. If you die the way I am teaching you, if you live the way I am teaching you, you will never know death. Even dying, you will know that the flame goes on burning forever.\nThe last question:\nBELOVED MASTER,\nQuestion 5\nINDIA IS THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHICH TALKS ABOUT CELIBACY SO MUCH AND YET EVERY FOUR SECONDS THREE CHILDREN ARE BORN IN INDIA. PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS.\nKamal Bharti, ideals create hypocrisy. and if you want to be a hypocrite, the first requirement is to have great ideals. You cannot be a hypocrite if you don’t have any ideals.\nFor example, my sannyasins cannot be hypocrites; it is impossible. Hypocrisy is the shadow, the long shadow, of the great ideal.\nIndia is one of the most hypocritical countries. And the reason is that great ideals are being taught to people. Those ideals remain only in their talk – life goes on in a totally diametrically opposite way. People go on talking about truth and their life has nothing of truth in it. They go on talking about great morality, and their whole life is immoral.\nYou cannot find a more immoral country in the world than this country, it is impossible – because no other country preaches so many ideals. When ideals are great, you cannot fulfill them; they are so unnatural, they are so impossible. Then the only way is to go on talking about them and go on living in your own way. So you have to live a double life.\nIn talking, in sermonizing, Indians are great. In philosophizing, nobody can compete with them. They are great logic-choppers, hair-splitters, great masters of language. But their life is empty, hollow, and is just the opposite.\nIn fact, if you know the ideal of a person, just by knowing the ideal, you can know his life. Tell me what your ideal is, and I will know your life immediately. If celibacy is your ideal, then I know who you are: you are sex-obsessed. Only a sex-obsessed person has the ideal of celibacy. If you are not sex-obsessed there will be no question of celibacy. You will live your life: when sex is happening it is beautiful, when it disappears it is beautiful. Both are sacred moments.\nSex is sacred when it happens. When it disappears, that too is sacred. Both have their beauties.\nWhen the tree blooms it has beauty, and when the tree is naked of all leaves it has a beauty. Yes, in the fall, trees have a totally different beauty, an austere beauty. Naked, without any leaves, standing against the sky, they look so meditative, so Zen-like. And then in the spring, with great foliage and many flowers, as if they are getting ready to be married – newlyweds... So much celebration, it has a beauty – the beauty of a Sufi.\nThe real man lives his life without any guilt. Sex appears one day and disappears one day. Remember: anything that appears, disappears. Up to the age of fourteen, sex has not appeared. Then suddenly one day, the spring: sex has come into life, with great joys, with great songs to be sung. If one lives it totally, then nearabout the age of forty-two it disappears one day. And the beauty of the fall, and the naked bare tree against the evening sky.\nSex has existence only from the fourteenth to the forty-second year, if things go naturally. But they don’t go naturally – the priest jumps in. He starts talking about celibacy. When all that was needed was the art of love, he starts talking about celibacy. He creates guilt. Sex energy becomes repressed, goes underneath into the unconscious.\nNow even at the age of eighty-two it will remain. You will remain sex-obsessed; it can’t leave you now.\nIndia is a so-called religious country. In fact countries can only be so-called religious. Only individuals can be really religious, countries can only be so-called religious. How can countries be religious? Religion is something that happens in the individual soul. Politics is that which happens in the collectivity. Religion is that which happens in your aloneness.\nBut great ideals go on torturing. India is very heavy-laden – great rocks are on the Indian heart. And because of those rocks the springs of life cannot flow.\nSo, Kamal, there is no contradiction in it. In fact there is a logical connectedness between these two things – talking of celibacy, and giving birth to three children every four seconds. The more you talk about celibacy, the more sex-obsessed you will become. If you accept sex as a natural phenomenon, you need not talk about celibacy; it comes in its own time.\nJust as youth turns into old age, sex turns into celibacy. Celibacy is sex lived truly, is the fragrance of sex lived truly. Celibacy is sexuality become mature. Otherwise hypocrisy continues.\nMeditate over this story.\nThis man was in bed with a married woman when they heard the door open. “Oh my God,” she gasped. “It’s my husband! Quick, hidden in the closet!”\nThe man hurried into the closet and closed the door. Suddenly he heard a small voice saying, “It’s very dark in here.”\n“Who is that?” he asked.\n“That’s my mother out there,” the small voice said. “And now I’m going to scream.” “Please don’t!” the man said.\n“Okay, but it’ll cost you money,” the boy said. “Here’s five dollars.”\n“I’m going to scream!” said the small voice. “Okay, here’s ten dollars!”\n“I’m going to scream,” the small voice said.\n“Here’s twenty dollars.”\nFinally, when the boy turned down thirty-five dollars, the man said, “All I have is forty dollars.” “I’ll take it.”\nAt last, the husband left and the man was able to get out of the closet and make a hasty exist. That afternoon, the mother took the boy with her on a shopping trip.\n“I want to get that bicycle,” he said.\nThe mother said, “No, you can’t. It costs too much money.” The boy said, “I’ve got forty dollars.”\nThe mother said, “Where would you get forty dollars?”\nThe boy wouldn’t talk, she began to berate him. He refused to respond. She slapped his face. He stood stoically. Finally, twisting his arm, she dragged him into the nearby neighborhood church and approached the parish priest. “Father, my son has forty dollars and he won’t tell me where he got it. Maybe you can find out?”\nThe priest nodded. He led the boy into a confessional booth. The boy sat on one side and the priest on the other. The boy said, “It’s very dark here...”\nAnd the priest said, “Now, don’t you start that again!”\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9992","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/unio_mystica_vol_2/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/unio_mystica_vol_2/>Unio Mystica, Vol 2</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">2 Defeating Buddha</h1><div class=post-meta>47 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9992 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Unio_Mystica_Vol_2/part2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

THE self. Man is constantly seeking the lost paradise: somewhere deep in
the recesses of human beings, the nostalgia persists. We have known
something that is only a far faraway memory, The memory is not even
conscious; we have lost all track of it, where it is. But the fragrance
goes on arising.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence religion is not an accidental phenomenon. It is not going to
disappear from the world; no communism, no fascism can make it
disappear. Religion is going to remain, because it is very essential.
Unless a man surpasses humanity, unless a man becomes a Buddha, religion
remains relevant. Only for a Buddha is religion irrelevant. He has
arrived: now there is no need for any search.</p><p><br></p><p>Parmita, there are not different searches for different human beings.
The search is singular, it is one, it is universal. The search is for
the self, the supreme self. One wants to know, “Who am I?” because
everything else is secondary. Without knowing oneself, whatsoever one is
doing is pointless. Unless I know exactly who I am, my whole life is
going to remain futile. It will not bring fruition, it will not bring
flowering, it will not bring fulfillment.</p><p><br></p><p>The first step has to be that of self-knowledge. But the paradox is
that if you start searching for A self you will miss THE self. By “a
self” I mean the ego, the process of egoing. That is a false</p><p>self: because we cannot find the true, we start creating the false,
just to console ourselves. It is a substitute. But the substitute can
never become the truth, and the substitute becomes a bondage.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth liberates. Substitutes for truth create prisons. The ego is the
greatest prison that man has yet invented; you are all feeling
suffocated, crushed. It is not that somebody else is doing it to you:
you are the doer of it. You have taken a wrong step. Rather than
searching for that which is, you have started substituting something for
it – a toy, a pseudo thing. It may console you, but it cannot bring
celebration to your life. And all consolation is suicidal, because while
you remain consoled, time goes on slipping out of your hands.</p><p><br></p><p>THE self is not A self. The self is exactly a no-self: there is no
idea of ‘I’ in it, it is universal. All ideas arise in it, but it cannot
be identified with any idea that arises in it. All ideas arise in it,
all ideas dissolve in it. It is the sky, the context of all contexts, it
is the space in which everything happens. But the space itself never
happens – it abides, it is always there, and because it is always there,
it is easy to miss it. Because it is so much there and always there, you
never become aware of its presence.</p><p><br></p><p>It is like the air: you don’t become aware of its presence. It is
like the ocean that surrounds the fish: the fish never becomes aware of
it. It is like the pressure of the air: the pressure is so much, it has
always been there, but you are not aware of it. It is like gravitation:
it is so much, but you are not aware of it. It is like the earth rushing
with great speed round and round the sun: the earth is a spaceship, but
nobody is aware of it. We are aboard a spaceship, and it is going at a
great speed. Still we are not aware of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Awareness needs some gaps. When there are no gaps you fall asleep;
you cannot remain aware.</p><p><br></p><p>If one has always been healthy, one will not be aware of health.
Awareness needs gaps – sometimes you should not be healthy. You should
fall ill, then you can have a sense of health. If there was no darkness
in the world and there was only light, nobody would have ever known
light; people would have missed it.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s how we go on missing the original self – you can call it God
or nirvana, it doesn’t matter. Sufis have two beautiful words. One is
FANA: FANA means dissolving the ego, dissolving the false substitute.
And the other word is BAQA: BAQA means the arrival, the arising, of the
real self.</p><p><br></p><p>The real self is universal. How to find it? It is not far away, so
you are not to make a long journey to it. It is so close that no journey
is needed at all. It is within you. Rather than journeying, you will
have to learn how to sit silently.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what meditation is all about – just sitting silently doing
nothing. Thoughts arise: you watch. Desires arise: you watch. But you
remain the watcher. You don’t become a victim of the desires and the
thoughts that are arising; you remain a watcher. You remain the context
of all contexts, you remain the space before which everything appears.
But the space never appears before itself – it cannot, it is
impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>The mirror cannot mirror itself, the eyes cannot see themselves. I
cannot catch hold of my hand with the same hand; it is impossible.</p><p>This is the most fundamental thing to remember, Parmita. You are the
watcher and never the watched, you are the observer and never the
observed, you are the witness and never the witnessed. You are pure
subjectivity. You never appear as an object – how can you appear as an
object in front of yourself? Whatsoever appears in front of you is not
you.</p><p><br></p><p>Go on eliminating the contents. Go on saying, “NETI NETI, I am not
this, I am not this.” Go on eliminating, and a moment comes when there
is nothing left to eliminate. There is pure silence: no content moves in
front of you, the mirror reflects nothing. That is the moment when
self-knowing arises in you. You become illumined, you are
enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>So these few fundamentals are to be remembered: the self is a
no-self. The self is not personal, it is universal. The self is the
space or context in which all “positionality” in life appears, occurs,
arises. It is the screen of life, but the screen itself never appears on
the screen, it cannot. Everything else appears on it, it itself remains
hidden. It is pure subjectivity.</p><p><br></p><p>This pure subjectivity is the ultimate goal everybody is searching
for. But it seems difficult. We are so prone to become identified with
the contents. So rather than searching for the real, we create something
unreal, which is easy. The artificial is always easy, you can
manufacture it.</p><p><br></p><p>Your ego is a manufactured phenomenon. And once you have manufactured
the ego... How is the ego manufactured? “I am a Hindu”: now you are on
the way to creating an ego. “I am beautiful, I am intelligent, I am
this, I am that” – you are bringing more and more bricks to make the
prison called ego.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is what we go on doing in our whole life. Earn more money,
have a bigger bank balance, and your ego will feel more grounded, more
supported, more secure. Become famous: the more people know about you,
the more you will think you are.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence the constant search for attention. If nobody pays any attention
to you, you are reduced to nothing. If you move on the street and nobody
says hello, people go on passing by, not even taking any note of you,
suddenly you start feeling the earth disappearing underneath your
feet.</p><p><br></p><p>What has happened? They are not feeding your ego. But people feed
each other’s egos, because that’s how THEY can be fed. Somebody says,
“How are you?” He is really saying, “Ask ME, ‘How are you?’” He is
simply asking for mutual gratification. And people do gratify each
other; we support each other’s egos: somebody praises you, you praise
him in return.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what we call society. It depends on mutual satisfactions, and
the greatest satisfaction seems to be ego-gratification.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence people are interested so much in politics, because politics can
gratify you as nothing else can. If you become politically powerful the
whole country is in your grip; the whole country has to pay attention to
you. You can impose your will on people, you have power.</p><p><br></p><p>The power of a politician is the power of violence. Now he controls
the whole mechanism of violence: he controls the police, the government,
the military, he controls everything. He can impose his will on you.
That’s why politicians tend to become violent sooner or later.
Politicians hanker deep down</p><p>for wars, because it is only in war that a politician becomes a GREAT
politician. If you go through history you will see the point.</p><p><br></p><p>Winston Churchill would not have been such a great leader if there
had been no second world war. Neither would Adolf Hitler have been such
a power if there had been no second world war, not would Mussolini. The
war created the context: they were able to be as violent as possible.
They were able to butcher people, to murder people, in millions.</p><p><br></p><p>People immediately pay attention when you are violent. If you live a
peaceful life, no newspaper is going to report about you in your whole
life. But if you kill somebody or you commit suicide, you will be
immediately in the newspapers.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days ago, Reverend Jones committed suicide with all of his
nine hundred disciples. You had never heard about this poor man before,
nobody knew that there was anybody like that. Now the whole world
knows.</p><p><br></p><p>They had lived in that commune for many years, but nobody would take
any note of them. It is possible that had you taken note of them, they
might not have needed to go to such an extreme, they might not have
committed suicide. This is his way of making the whole world feel his
presence – this is a very pathological way, ugly, but this is the same
phenomenon again. People are searching for the ego: if they cannot find
it through being creative, they will find it through being destructive.
If they cannot find it by being a great saint, they will find it by
being a great sinner.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody asked George Bernard Shaw, “Where would you like to go when
you die – to heaven or to hell?” He said, “It all depends.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “What do you mean, ‘It all depends’?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “If I am going to be the first in heaven, then to heaven. If
I am going to be second there, no. Then it is better to be in hell but
be first.”</p><p><br></p><p>He is joking, but he is telling a truth – a truth about you, a truth
about the whole humanity, the way it lives through ambition, through
egoing.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, the real self has nothing to do with anybody else paying
attention to you. Note the difference: the false self needs others’
attention to be paid to you, and the real self only needs your attention
– just your attention, and that’s enough.</p><p><br></p><p>If you turn your attention inwards, you will know the real self. If
you go on seeking others’ attention, you will continuously live in a
false entity which is always ready to disappear if you don’t feed it
continuously. It has to be supported.</p><p><br></p><p>The ego is not an entity. It is not a noun, it is a verb. That’s why
I am saying it is egoing. You cannot remain satisfied with any attention
paid to you, you have to ask and hanker for more. You have to go on
egoing; it is only through egoing that the ego can exist. It is a
process – and it is so false and its demands are so ugly! It is a lie.
It demands more and more lies from you, and to gratify it you have to
become utterly false. You have to become a personality.</p><p>A personality means a false phenomenon, a mask. You have to become an
actor; you are no longer a real person, you are no longer authentic. You
don’t have any substance, you are just a shadow. And because of this
shadow there is always fear of death, because any moment this shadow can
disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>Your bank can go bankrupt, and immediately you are gone, you are
nobody. Your power can be lost, because there are other competitors
pushing you. This whole life is a constant pushing and pulling, hence
there is so much agony.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you know the root of the word agony? It comes from ‘ag’: ag means
pushing. You are continuously being pushed, and in your turn you are
pushing others; that creates agony.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole world lives in anguish and agony. Only the person who comes
to know his real self goes beyond it and enters into the world of
ecstasy. And there are the two states: agony and ecstasy.</p><p><br></p><p>Parmita, you are in agony, as everybody else is. And the search is
for ecstasy. Remember always, your commitments, your ideologies, your
so-called ultimate values, your theologies, philosophies and religions
provide contexts, often valuable contexts, for individual existence. But
they are not what you are.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not even your body. You are not your mind. You are neither
black nor white, you are neither Indian nor German. You cannot be
defined in any way, all definitions will fall short. You are
indefinable; you are something that surpasses all definitions. You are
the vast sky in which planets appear and earths appear, and sun and moon
and stars – and they all disappear, and the sky remains as it has
remained always. The sky knows no change. You are that unchanging sky.
Clouds come and go, you are always here.</p><p><br></p><p>When Raman Maharshi was dying, somebody asked, “Bhagwan, soon you
will be leaving your body; where will you go?” He opened his eyes,
laughed and said, “Where can I go? I have been here, I will be here.
Where can I go – WHERE? There is nowhere to go. I am everywhere: I have
been here and I will remain here for ever and ever.”</p><p><br></p><p>He is saying that he has come to know his being as the sky; he is no
longer a cloud.</p><p><br></p><p>If you really want to search for the real self, don’t get attached to
any commitment, to any program, to any idea. Remain unattached,
flexible, fluid; don’t become stagnant. Always remain in a state of
unfrozenness; don’t freeze. The moment you freeze, you have something
ale in our hands; a cloud has arisen. Remain in a state of meltedness,
don’t become committed to any form or name. And then something
tremendous starts happening to you: for the first time you start feeling
who you are. The feeling does not come from the outside, it arises from
the inner depths of your being. It floods you. It is light, utter light,
it is bliss, utter bliss. It is divine. It is another name for God.</p><p><br></p><p>Never become crystallized; if you become crystallized in something,
you are encaged. Remain free, remain freedom. All identity creates
fixation; and every fixation, every identification, is a liability. The
more fixed one’s identity, the less the experience of which one is
capable. The point is not to lack a position, but not to be
positional.</p><p>I am not saying to become unthinking. Remain intelligent, capable of
thinking, but never get identified with any thought. Use the thought as
a tool, as an instrument; remember that you are the master. Not to be
attached to whatever position one has at any particular moment is the
beginning of self- knowledge. One IS, one experiences aliveness, to the
extent to which one can transcend particular positions and can assume
other viewpoints.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what I mean by remaining fluid, flowing. One should remain
available to the present. Die to the past each moment, so that nothing
about you remains fixed. Don’t carry a character around yourself; all
characters are armors, imprisonments.</p><p><br></p><p>The real man of character is characterless – you will be surprised by
this. The real man of character is characterless: he has consciousness,
but he has no character. He lives moment to moment. Responsible he is,
but he responds out of the moment, not out of past contexts. He carries
no ready-made programs in his being. The more you have ready-made
programs, the more you are an ego. When you have none – no programs,
nothing ready-made in you – when each moment you are as fresh as if you
are born anew, to me that is freedom. And only a free consciousness can
know the true self.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the search, Parmita. Nothing else will ever satisfy, nothing
else can ever satisfy. All are consolations – and it is better to drop
them, it is better to become aware that consolations are not going to
help.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what I call sannyas: dropping consolations, renouncing
consolations – not the world but consolations – renouncing all that is
false, becoming true, becoming simple, natural, spontaneous. That’s my
vision of a sannyasin, the vision of total freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>And in those beautiful moments of total freedom, the first rays of
light enter you, the first glimpses of who you are. And the grandeur of
it is such, and the splendor of it is such, that you will be surprised
to find that you have been carrying the kingdom of God within you and
you have remained so unaware, and for so long. You will be surprised
that it was possible not to know such a treasure. Such an inexhaustible
treasure is within you.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus goes on repeating again and again, “The kingdom of God is
within you.” Call it the kingdom of God or the supreme self or nirvana
or whatever you will, that is our search – everyone’s, not only of human
beings but of all beings. Even trees are growing towards it, even birds
are searching for it, even rivers are rushing towards it. The whole
existence is an adventure.</p><p><br></p><p>And that is the beauty of this existence. If it was not an adventure,
life would be absolute boredom. Life is a celebration because it is an
adventure.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>HOW DID I GET SO LUCKY TO FALL IN THE GRACE OF YOUR LOVE IN THESE
TIMES OF SUCH CONFUSION IN THE WORLD?</p><p>Prem Debal, the times of confusion and chaos are the greatest times
to live in. When the society is static there is not much to live for, to
live with. When a society is secure and there is no confusion and there
is no chaos, then people live a dull, drab, dragging life – comfortable,
convenient, stable, but not alive.</p><p><br></p><p>It is only in the times of chaos and confusion that great things
happen, because people are loose. They are loose, uprooted: they can
search for new soils, they can search for new lands, they can search for
new countries, they can search for new continents of being.</p><p><br></p><p>This is one of the greatest moments in the history of human
consciousness. It has never been so; this is a crescendo.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said – and he seems to have detected it richly – that after
each twenty-five centuries there comes a moment of great turmoil and
chaos. And that is the time when the greatest number of people become
enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>Now twenty-five centuries have passed since Buddha. Again you are
coming closer and closer to a moment where the past will lose all
meaning. When the past loses ll meaning, you are free, you are
untethered from the past: you can use this freedom to grow tremendously,
to grow to undreamed-of heights.</p><p><br></p><p>But you can destroy yourself too. If you are not intelligent, the
confusion, the chaos, will destroy you. Millions will be destroyed –
because of their unintelligence, not because of the chaos. They will be
destroyed because they will not be able to find a secure and comfortable
and convenient life, as was possible in the past. They will not be able
to find where they belong. They will have to live from their own
sources; they will have to be individuals, they will have to be
rebels.</p><p><br></p><p>The society is disappearing, the family is disappearing; now it is
very difficult. Unless you are capable of being an individual it is
going to be difficult to live. Only individuals will survive.</p><p><br></p><p>Now people who have become too accustomed to slavery, accustomed to
being commanded, accustomed to being ordered by somebody else – people
who have become too much accustomed to father-figures – they will be in
a state of insanity. But that is their fault, it is not the fault of the
times. The times are beautiful, because the times of chaos are the times
of revolution.</p><p><br></p><p>It is possible now to get out of the wheel of life and death more
easily than it has been possible for twenty-five centuries since Buddha.
In Buddha’s time, many people became enlightened; the society was in a
turmoil. Again it is happening. Great times are ahead – prepare for
them.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s what I am trying to do here. Orthodox people cannot
understand what is happening here; they have no eyes to see it and no
heart to feel it. They only have old rotten values, and they go on
judging me according to hose values. Those values are out of date. I am
creating new people, I am creating new values, I am creating a new
future. They live in the past; they cannot understand the future that I
am trying to bring here to the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>My sannyasins don’t belong to the past, they don’t represent any
tradition. They belong to the future: they belong to something that is
going to happen and has not yet happened. Hence there are no criteria –
they cannot be judged easily, and they will be misunderstood.</p><p>I am going to be misunderstood, because people have their values, and
those values come from the past. And I am trying to create a space for
the future to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>You say: HOW DID I GET SO LUCKY TO FALL IN THE GRACE OF YOUR LOVE IN
THESE TIMES OF SUCH CONFUSION IN THE WORLD?</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a question of luck, it is a question of intelligence. That
is the only luck in the world – intelligence. And remember, everybody is
born with intelligence but people don’t use it, because to be
intelligent is to live in danger.</p><p><br></p><p>The intelligent child will be a constant pain in the neck for the
parents; they try to crush his intelligence. Nobody wants an
intelligence child, because he creates suspicions in you, he creates
doubts in you. An intelligent child asks questions you cannot answer. An
intelligent child is a problem for the teachers in the school, in the
college, in the university.</p><p><br></p><p>An intelligent person will always remain a problem, wherever he is.
So the society tries in every way to destroy your intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard:</p><p><br></p><p>The teacher told the students that they were going to play a
game.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’ve got something behind my back and I’m going to describe it and
you guess what it is,” she said. “I’m holding something round and red.
Can someone guess?”</p><p>“An apple?” little Herbie said.</p><p><br></p><p>“No,” said the teacher, “but it shows you were thinking. It’s a
cherry. Now I’m holding something round and orange. Can you tell me what
it is?”</p><p><br></p><p>“An orange?” little Herbie said.</p><p><br></p><p>“No,” said the teacher, “but it shows you were thinking. It’s a
peach.” Herbie raised his hand. “Teacher, can I play the game too?”</p><p>The teacher said, yes, and Herbie went to the back of the room, faced
the rear and said, “Teacher, I’m holding something about two inches long
with a red tip.”</p><p><br></p><p>The teacher said, “Herbie!”</p><p><br></p><p>“No,” said little Herbie, “but it shows you were thinking. It’s a
match.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, these intelligent children cannot be allowed to live! Nobody
likes an intelligent person. Hence people start playing unintelligent
roles in life, because an unintelligent person is accepted everywhere.
That’s why millions of people have become mediocre. Nobody is born
mediocre, let</p><p>me remind you. God gives intelligence to everybody; just as he gives
life to everybody, he gives intelligence. Intelligence is an intrinsic
part of life.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever seen an unintelligent animal? Have you ever seen an
unintelligent bird, an unintelligent tree? Every tree is intelligent
enough to find the source of water to send out roots. And you will be
surprised, scientists are very much surprised, at how trees find
places.</p><p><br></p><p>When a tree starts sending out its roots, sometimes it sends them
hundreds of feet away in a particular direction to where water is. Now,
how does it find it? The water is a hundred feet away towards the north:
it does not send its roots towards the south, it sends its roots towards
the north – a hundred feet away! and not only to natural water sources –
sometimes it sends its roots to the pipes, corporation pipes, hundreds
of feet away; it detects them. It takes YEARS for it to send out those
roots. It lives, in its own way, an intelligent life.</p><p><br></p><p>If there is too much competition, trees grow higher; they have to.
That’s why in the jungles of Africa, trees grow very high. The same
trees in India won’t grow that high; there is no need, the competition
is not so much. In thick forests if the tree remains small it will die;
it will be in the shadow of other trees. It has to reach the sun: it
goes on and on moving upwards.</p><p><br></p><p>Trees are intelligent in their own way, birds are intelligent in
their own way, animals are intelligent in their own way. And so is
man.</p><p><br></p><p>You will find the mediocre and the stupid only in human beings. I
have never come across a stupid dog – I have tried – but there are
millions of stupid human beings. What has happened to human beings?
Intelligence is not allowed.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole society and the pattern of the society is against
intelligence; it supports mediocre people. Everybody is happy with a
mediocre person, because whenever you are around a mediocre person he is
never a problem; he is always ready to be obedient, and he always gives
you a feeling that you are superior.</p><p><br></p><p>If people live intelligently, everybody will be lucky. If you are not
lucky, it is not that God has been unfair to you, it is only because you
have compromised with the society.</p><p><br></p><p>Debal, you could come to me because you have been courageous enough
to use your intelligence. It is not a question of luck, it is only a
question of guts, courage. And these days are really beautiful,
fantastic. Use these days, these times: you can soar high, higher than
has ever been possible before.</p><p><br></p><p>Millions of people are in the situation now where enlightenment can
happen. We can defeat Buddha for the first time. The times are very
favorable, because there is so much chaos and so much confusion, and all
the old ideologies are dead and dying of their own accord. Man is
becoming free, coming out of his shell.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question: Question 3</p><p>BELOVED MASTER, I HAVE BEEN TO MANY GURUS BUT I HAVE NOT CHANGED A
BIT. WHY?</p><p><br></p><p>To expect that just by being to many gurus you will be transformed is
foolish. Nobody can transform you. The very idea, the very expectation
that somebody else is going to transform you, keeps you unintelligent.
When are you going to declare the mastery of your own being? When are
you going to take the reins in your own hands? When are you going to
say, “I will now live according to myself”?</p><p><br></p><p>And those so-called gurus you have been to will make you more and
more mediocre and stupid. They want you obedience – and only stupid
people can be obedient. They will not help you to become more
intelligent.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very rare to find a master. Out of a hundred, ninety-nine are
bogus, and the one who is not bogus will demand so much from you. First
he will demand intelligence – and you have completely forgotten that you
have that t all in the first place. He will demand awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>The false gurus, the false so-called masters, provide you with better
sleeping-pills. They provide you with psychological strategies to remain
comfortably asleep, they give you lullabies, so that you can live a
drugged life. Their methods are nothing but psychological tranquilizers,
non-medicinal tranquilizers. So for a few days you feel god, you repeat
a certain mantra and you feel good, and then you become fed up and you
start seeing the point that it is not leading you anywhere. Then you go
to another guru, he gives you some other method, for a few days again
the honeymoon, and then that disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>But one thing you should be thankful for: it is because of all those
gurus that you have come here. And now you cannot goof off; it is
impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t give you any lullaby, I will give you electric shocks –
because that is the only way you can come out of your drugged state.</p><p><br></p><p>Two drunks were sitting in a bar, thinking of things to do to pass
the time. “Let’s play television,” said one.</p><p>“Okay,” said the other. “How?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I make believe I’m a great big TV star and you guess who I am.”</p><p><br></p><p>“All right,” said the first. “I’m five-foot-four, got blonde hair,
blue eyes, I’m 38-24-36 and I’m beautiful.” The second drunk stared at
him for a moment. “Never mind who you are,” he said, “Kish me.”</p><p>This is your state. You have to be shocked, you have to be brought to
consciousness. Hence I don’t provide you with any consolations – you
would like them, you would love them.</p><p><br></p><p>So those who come here for consolations can have no understanding of
what is happening here. And you can go and on, from one school to
another school, from one guru to another guru; that is not going to
change you at all. It is not a question of traveling from one place to
another place;</p><p>you will remain that which you are. Only if you are shocked, only if
somebody is there who can destroy you, who can destroy you as you are,
only then will your real being come out. The unreal has become a thick
foliage around you.</p><p><br></p><p>A Hindu can become a Christian; nothing will change. Instead of
Krishna he will start torturing Christ, that’s all. A Jew can become a
Hindu; that will not help either. You go on changing your masks, your
garments, but the change is needed somewhere deep in your being – not on
the periphery but at the core.</p><p><br></p><p>Morgenstern lived in difficult times. Life was hard, especially if
you were a Jew. So he decided to become a Roman Catholic and was
baptized.</p><p><br></p><p>The first time he went to confession, he stole the parish priest’s
gold watch! But he was honest, and so he immediately confessed:</p><p><br></p><p>“Father, I have stolen an expensive watch and now I feel very guilty
about it. I confess that what I did was immoral and totally wrong.
Please, Father, may I give you the watch?”</p><p><br></p><p>The priest was surprised but shook his head. “No, I couldn’t possibly
accept it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Morgenstern insisted. “Please, Father, I feel so guilty, won’t you
please accept the watch as a sign of my repentance?”</p><p><br></p><p>“That isn’t possible, my son,” said the priest, moved by
Morgenstern’s deep sincerity. “You must return the watch to its original
owner.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ahh!” said Morgenstern with a deep sigh. “I’ve tried, Father, I
swear I’ve tried, but I’m afraid the good man doesn’t want it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“In that case, my son,” said the priest, “I see nothing wrong with
your keeping the watch, and since you’ve now confessed, there’s no need
at all anymore for you to feel guilty!”</p><p><br></p><p>You see the Jewish mind?</p><p><br></p><p>You can go on changing your religion, you can go on changing your
philosophy – these are really ways to avoid the real change. The real
change has to happen deep down in you. You are unconscious, and the only
change that is going to help is to become conscious. You are living
mechanically: the only thing that can help is to live life
non-mechanically. De-automatize yourself, de-hypnotize yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>The society has hypnotized you. The society has dulled your senses,
it has poisoned you. It wants skillful efficient machines; it does not
want men. It has reduced you to a machine. You are a good clerk or a
good soldier or a good stationmaster or a good deputy collector – it has
reduced you to something which has a utility. It has made you a
commodity. It does not want your intelligence, your awareness. You will
have to rebel against it.</p><p><br></p><p>And the gurus you have been to are nothing but agents of the same
society. Hence the society respects them, hence the society supports
them.</p><p>I cannot be supported by the society. It is a sheer miracle that I am
existing, it is very illogical. I should not be here at all. The society
does not support me, it cannot support me. In every possible way it will
create – it IS creating – hindrances for my work.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I was reading in the newspapers, one man has
suggested to the government that I should be expelled from India. He
must be a very religious man, because he says I am destroying religion.
And he is not satisfied with just my expulsion – he then suggests my
tongue should be cut out, so that I cannot speak; and my hands should
also be cut off, so that I cannot write. And he thinks he is a religious
man.</p><p><br></p><p>But that’s what people have always done. They crucified Jesus, and
they were thinking they were doing something very religious. They
murdered the great Sufi master, al-Hillaj Mansoor, in exactly the same
way. This man who has suggested this to the government may have been
part of the crowd who killed Mansoor, because this was the way: his
hands were cut off, his tongue was cut out, then his head was cut off.
It seems the society goes on perpetuating its old stupidities. And he is
thinking that he is suggesting this to protect religion, that religion
is in danger – because of me, religion is in danger.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is not in danger because of me, but pseudo-religion
certainly is in danger. And the society needs pseudo-religions so that
the real religion can be avoided, because real religion always creates
trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>A Buddha, a Jesus, a Mansoor, a Sanai – whenever these people walk on
the earth they create fire, they create revolution. They start
transforming people, transforming their unconsciousness into
consciousness. And then there is trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>It happens every day here: a couple comes here, and within seven days
they have separated. Now, what has happened? And they had lived for
twenty years together! For twenty years they were compromising and
compromising and compromising. For twenty years they were suffering;
they were miserable together. But they were carrying on somehow in a
state of unconsciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment they are here, they start meditating. They go into a few
therapy groups, and they become alert and they say, what have they been
doing? The man comes to see that he has never loved this woman, he has
been deceiving – he has been deceiving the woman, he has been deceiving
himself. The woman comes to see that she has never loved this man; this
man seems to be a stranger, she does not know who he is. And why have
they been living together and torturing each other? Suddenly they are
awake and the marriage has gone to the dogs.</p><p><br></p><p>People will be afraid of such a place: their marriage may disappear,
their old ways of living may be shattered. It is ultimately good that
something wrong falls down and disappears, but in the beginning it is
painful. Twenty years you have lived with a woman: it is difficult to
unclinch yourself, it is painful, it is agony.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you don’t stop a false relationship, you will never be in any
true relationship in your life. And a true relationship is a mirror: it
helps you to see your face, who you are. But only a true relationship is
a mirror. A false relationship is a stone wall; you cannot be mirrored
in it, it is utterly futile.</p><p>Parents are afraid; they don’t want their children to come here,
because I will teach them to be themselves. And if the child wants to be
a musician, I will say, “Become a musician, even if you remain a
beggar.” And the parents wanted him to become a doctor or an engineer –
now there is going to be trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>The child, if he becomes an engineer, will have much money, prestige,
power, but he will miss his soul. He will never come to know any joy in
his life; he will know misery, he will never know any rejoicing. But the
parents are more interested in money and power and prestige. That’s what
has been told to them by their parents; this is their tradition.</p><p><br></p><p>Each generation goes on corrupting the new generation. Each
generation goes on loading the new generation with its own diseases,
illnesses and pathologies.</p><p><br></p><p>If you come here, I am going to unburden you of all your pathologies.
And they may be very traditional and very long-respected, and your
parents may have carried them for thousands of years, but I will teach
you to drop all that nonsense, all that rubbish, and simply become your
own being, your own self. Now, the society cannot tolerate it. The
society is bound to be inimical, antagonistic towards me. This has
always been so.</p><p><br></p><p>You must have gone to the gurus who are agents of the same rotten
society. How can they help you to change? They are there to protect the
society. The society gives them respect, that is how the society goes on
paying them for their services.</p><p><br></p><p>Your teachers are in the service of the past. Your priests are in the
service of the past, your politicians are in the service of the past.
And I want you to become aware of the present.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have some courage in your heart, and you don’t escape from
this surgical energy-field, you will be transformed. And remember, I
will not transform you, I can only create situations in which you can
transform yourself. I am simply creating a field in which things can
happen – they are happening. Now don’t escape from here. Just a few
months, and then you cannot escape!</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>WHY ARE YOU SO MUCH AGAINST ASCETICISM? ISN’T ASCETICISM A VALID PATH
TO GOD?</p><p><br></p><p>Path? It is a pathology. To be an ascetic simply shows that you are
masochistic, that you are suicidal, that you enjoy torturing yourself.
And by torturing yourself you can create a certain character, but the
character will be only on the surface. It will not transform you, it
will only be a pretension. It will be only a face, a facade, a
camouflage.</p><p><br></p><p>Ascetics have existed in the world because there are suicidal people.
And there is a death instinct in man – Sigmund Freud has called it
“thanatos.” Sigmund Freud’s contribution to human growth is immense. In
his early life he discovered the life-instinct – sex, eros. And then in
his later life, when he was getting old, he discovered another thing –
thanatos, against eros.</p><p>There are two basic instincts in man: one is to live, another is to
die. Both are there. If the instinct to live is not supported, the other
instinct becomes powerful. If the instinct to live is supported, if life
is affirmed, then the other instinct disappears. It is the same energy –
either it will flow through eros, or it will flow through thanatos. It
depends on you.</p><p><br></p><p>The religions of the world up to now have been death-oriented. And
remember, when I say “religions” I don’t include Buddhas. I don’t
include Bahauddin, Sanai, Attar, Mahavira, Jesus, Mohammed, no. But I
include Mohammedanism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, Jainism,
Buddhism. All the organized religions of the world have been
death-oriented. And this is something unbelievable: all the original
beings were life-oriented.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha is utterly life-oriented, but Buddhism is death-oriented.
Mohammed is life-oriented, but Mohammedanism is death-oriented. How does
it happen?</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day, I was saying that truth transferred from one to
another becomes a lie; it goes upside down. When Buddha says something,
he means something totally different than that which is understood by
the blind and unconscious people. Everything goes topsy-turvy. His
life-affirmation becomes death-affirmation in the disciples. This has
been a constant problem. Up to now it has not been possible to transfer
truth, and I don’t think it will ever be possible to transfer it.
Because the Buddha speaks from the peak of the Himalayas and you listen
in the dark valley. By the time it reaches to you, by the time you have
interpreted it, it has already gone sour, bitter; it is no more the same
truth.</p><p><br></p><p>So all the original religious founders were life-affirmative. And all
the religions that were born out of their teachings became
death-oriented.</p><p><br></p><p>Asceticism is falling in love with death. It is a pathology, it is
not a path. But people respect it, because the ascetic seems so
different from you. You love food, he hates food. you love a good bath,
he hates to take a bath. Jaina monks don’t take baths – not only that,
they don’t clean their teeth either. They are against the body.</p><p><br></p><p>You love comforts, the ascetic loves discomfort. He is not at ease
with comfort, he is at ease only when he is uncomfortable. You call it a
path? It is a pathology. The man who is standing on his head, and feels
comfortable only when he stands on his head, is ill, is abnormal.</p><p><br></p><p>All the animals laugh about it. Whenever animals see a yogi standing
on his head, they laugh. They cannot believe what has happened to this
man. People go on torturing their bodies, twisting their bodies.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard:</p><p><br></p><p>Reggie owned an elephant, but the cost of feeding it was getting out
of hand. Then he go an idea. He had seen elephants lift one leg, and
even two legs. Once in a circus he’d even seen an elephant lift three
legs in the air and stand on just one.</p><p><br></p><p>So Reggie announced to the world that he’d pay ten thousand dollars
to anyone who could make his elephant stand in the air on no legs.
However, each person who wanted to try would have to pay a hundred
dollars.</p><p>People came from near and far. They tried everything from coaxing to
hypnotism, but no one could make the elephant rise up in the air.</p><p><br></p><p>Then one day a blue convertible drove up and a little man got out and
addressed Reggie: “Is it true that you’ll pay ten thousand dollars if I
make your elephant get off all four legs?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes,” Reggie said. “But you’ve got to pay one hundred dollars to
try.”</p><p><br></p><p>The little man handed Reggie a hundred-dollar bill. Then he went back
to the car and took out a metal club. He walked up to the elephant and
looked him in the eye. Then he walked behind the elephant and swung
hard, hitting the elephant smack on the balls. The elephant let out a
roar and flew up into the air.</p><p><br></p><p>After the little man had collected his ten thousand dollars, Reggie
was very depressed. He’d only taken in eight thousand dollars and now
he’d not only lost a couple of grand but still had the problem of
feeding and housing the elephant.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly Reggie got another inspiration. He knew that elephants could
move their heads up and down, but he had never seen one move from side
to side. So he announced that he would pay ten thousand dollars to
anyone who could make his elephant move his head from side to side.
However, each person who wanted to try would have to pay one hundred
dollars.</p><p><br></p><p>People came from near and far. They paid their hundred and they
tried, but of course none succeeded.</p><p><br></p><p>Then just when things were going well, a familiar blue convertible
drove up and the little man came out. He addressed Reggie: “Is it true
that you’ll pay me ten thousand dollars if I can make your elephant move
his head from side to side?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes,” said Reggie. “But you’ve got to pay a hundred dollars to
try.”</p><p><br></p><p>The little man handed Reggie the hundred dollars. Then he returned to
his car and took out his metal club. He walked up to the elephant.</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you remember me?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The elephant nodded by shaking his head up and down. “Do you want me
to do it again?”</p><p>The elephant quickly shook his head – no.</p><p><br></p><p>Even elephants understand it – but man is such a fool. Asceticism a
path? It is a pathology.</p><p><br></p><p>Life has to be lived in its totality. Your energies have to flow
through eros: eros is life, love is life. And whenever your energy is
flowing against love, against life, beware: you are falling astray, you
are going away from God. God is life, God is eros.</p><p>Now see the point: all the ascetic people and all the ascetic schools
are against love, against sex, against life, against food – against
living a healthy life of rejoicing.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why they are so much against me – because I would like you to
live fully, totally, wholly. I would like you to accept life without
denying yourself anything, without feeling in any way guilty. All guilt
is a cunning strategy of the priests to divert your energy from life
towards death.</p><p><br></p><p>Why have people done it? There are reasons. The politician wants
people not to love life too much – because if people love life too much
then people cannot be forced to go to wars. Who wants to die? There
would be no army left in the world. People have to be forced against
eros, they have to be forced against life, they have to be taught to
love death, respect death and feel death as sacred – only then can there
be armies. And great armies are needed. The politician is against love,
against life, because he needs soldiers for death, to die and to
kill.</p><p><br></p><p>The priest also wants people not to love life. If they love life they
will not bother about the temples and the churches and the mosques. And
if they really love life they will find God through life – the priest
will not be needed. The priest is needed only when people have gone
astray from life – only then can he become the guide and can he tell
them, “Now I will lead you to the right path.” First they have to be
helped to go astray, then the guides come.</p><p><br></p><p>First people have to be made ill, then you can sell medicine.
Otherwise you cannot sell medicine. If everybody is healthy, who will go
to the physician and who will go to the druggist? And who will be able
to sell medicine to people? It will be impossible. People have to be
ill, only then can factories and factories of medicine go on
manufacturing new drugs.</p><p><br></p><p>The priest needs people to go away from life. The moment they go away
from life, they go away from God. Then there is a need for the priest
and the temple and the church and the organization and the organized
religion. The people would like to be Christians and Hindus and
Mohammedans.</p><p><br></p><p>Otherwise life is so tremendously satisfying – who bothers? Who
cares?</p><p><br></p><p>Reverend Jones was able to kill nine hundred people, innocent people,
for a simple reason: he was training them for death. You will be
surprised to know that in Jonestown, lovemaking among the members of the
sect was not allowed. Celibacy was enforced. There were hard strict
rules: the people were not allowed to go outside the commune, no contact
with outsiders was allowed. They were living in isolation, they were all
ascetics.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is because of this asceticism that they were ready to commit
suicide. Now people are searching for the causes. Somebody thinks that
he hypnotized people, somebody thinks something else – a thousand and
one reasons are being found. The simple reason is, he diverted their
eros – that’s all. And eros can be diverted very easily.</p><p><br></p><p>Down the ages, religious people have been doing the same. He did it
to the logical end. Ordinarily monks die slowly; they commit a slow
suicide. He went fast and quickly. But there was a tendency, an
atmosphere of death. They were practising death almost every month.
Every month he would call the commune together and order them to die.
And they were ready. They had said yes so many times that when it was
really asked they could not say no. It had become an inbuilt
program.</p><p>And their life was so ugly, that’s why they were ready to die.</p><p><br></p><p>I have always loved a certain story. An English diplomat went to see
Adolf Hitler before the second world war. They were standing on the
terrace of a three-storey building, talking. Just to show his power to
the English diplomat, Hitler ordered one soldier to jump. The soldier
immediately jumped, fell on the road and died.</p><p><br></p><p>The English diplomat was very much shaken. And Adolf Hitler laughed
and said, “My whole country is ready to follow my orders in this way.”
To emphasize it more, he ordered another soldier to jump. And before the
English diplomat could prevent him, he also jumped. To make the thing
absolutely clear, he ordered a third soldier – but before he could jump,
the English diplomat caught hold of him and said, “Are you mad? What are
you doing? Why are you so ready to leave your life?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the man said, “Leave me alone! You call this life?”</p><p><br></p><p>To be with Adolf Hitler is far worse – it is better to die. These
people who committed suicide must have been living a worse life than
death itself. This is the simple logic of it. And the ascetic attitude
makes your life so ugly, so intolerable, that one starts thinking of
death as a deliverance.</p><p><br></p><p>I am against ascetic attitudes, because they are ill attitudes,
unhealthy, unwholesome. I am all for eros, I am all for life – because
life is the temple of God, the only temple. And eros is the only way God
is expressed in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>If you move totally into eros, into love of life, into
life-affirmation, into rejoicing, you will find, deep down hidden in
life, God himself. Life is his manifestation; he is the hidden source of
it. Don’t go away from life – going away is going away from God. Hence
my sannyasins are not to renounce but to rejoice.</p><p><br></p><p>Now people have asked me a few questions: “Can the same thing happen
here as happened in Reverend Jones’ commune?”</p><p><br></p><p>This will be the last place in the world where it could happen,
because I teach you love, I teach you life. My whole effort is to make
your energy move through life totally – nothing is left. And if you move
totally through life, death disappears. Even when you die, you will not
see that death is happening to you – you will see only that you are
changing your abode, you are changing your garments. You are on an
eternal pilgrimage.</p><p><br></p><p>I teach you life, I teach you abundant life. This cannot happen here
– I am not teaching you suicide. It can happen in any ascetic society,
in any ascetic commune. But my commune is not ascetic at all. That’s why
Christians are against it, and Hindus are against it, and Jainas are
against it, and Mohammedans are against it, and everybody is against it
– because they are all death-oriented. And my love is unconditionally
for life.</p><p><br></p><p>I teach you to love and to live. Death is impossible here – what to
say of suicide? Even death is impossible here. If you die the way I am
teaching you, if you live the way I am teaching you, you will never know
death. Even dying, you will know that the flame goes on burning
forever.</p><p><br></p><p>The last question:</p><p>BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5</p><p><br></p><p>INDIA IS THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHICH TALKS ABOUT CELIBACY SO
MUCH AND YET EVERY FOUR SECONDS THREE CHILDREN ARE BORN IN INDIA. PLEASE
EXPLAIN THIS.</p><p><br></p><p>Kamal Bharti, ideals create hypocrisy. and if you want to be a
hypocrite, the first requirement is to have great ideals. You cannot be
a hypocrite if you don’t have any ideals.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, my sannyasins cannot be hypocrites; it is impossible.
Hypocrisy is the shadow, the long shadow, of the great ideal.</p><p><br></p><p>India is one of the most hypocritical countries. And the reason is
that great ideals are being taught to people. Those ideals remain only
in their talk – life goes on in a totally diametrically opposite way.
People go on talking about truth and their life has nothing of truth in
it. They go on talking about great morality, and their whole life is
immoral.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot find a more immoral country in the world than this
country, it is impossible – because no other country preaches so many
ideals. When ideals are great, you cannot fulfill them; they are so
unnatural, they are so impossible. Then the only way is to go on talking
about them and go on living in your own way. So you have to live a
double life.</p><p><br></p><p>In talking, in sermonizing, Indians are great. In philosophizing,
nobody can compete with them. They are great logic-choppers,
hair-splitters, great masters of language. But their life is empty,
hollow, and is just the opposite.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, if you know the ideal of a person, just by knowing the
ideal, you can know his life. Tell me what your ideal is, and I will
know your life immediately. If celibacy is your ideal, then I know who
you are: you are sex-obsessed. Only a sex-obsessed person has the ideal
of celibacy. If you are not sex-obsessed there will be no question of
celibacy. You will live your life: when sex is happening it is
beautiful, when it disappears it is beautiful. Both are sacred
moments.</p><p><br></p><p>Sex is sacred when it happens. When it disappears, that too is
sacred. Both have their beauties.</p><p><br></p><p>When the tree blooms it has beauty, and when the tree is naked of all
leaves it has a beauty. Yes, in the fall, trees have a totally different
beauty, an austere beauty. Naked, without any leaves, standing against
the sky, they look so meditative, so Zen-like. And then in the spring,
with great foliage and many flowers, as if they are getting ready to be
married – newlyweds... So much celebration, it has a beauty – the beauty
of a Sufi.</p><p><br></p><p>The real man lives his life without any guilt. Sex appears one day
and disappears one day. Remember: anything that appears, disappears. Up
to the age of fourteen, sex has not appeared. Then suddenly one day, the
spring: sex has come into life, with great joys, with great songs to be
sung. If one lives it totally, then nearabout the age of forty-two it
disappears one day. And the beauty of the fall, and the naked bare tree
against the evening sky.</p><p>Sex has existence only from the fourteenth to the forty-second year,
if things go naturally. But they don’t go naturally – the priest jumps
in. He starts talking about celibacy. When all that was needed was the
art of love, he starts talking about celibacy. He creates guilt. Sex
energy becomes repressed, goes underneath into the unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>Now even at the age of eighty-two it will remain. You will remain
sex-obsessed; it can’t leave you now.</p><p><br></p><p>India is a so-called religious country. In fact countries can only be
so-called religious. Only individuals can be really religious, countries
can only be so-called religious. How can countries be religious?
Religion is something that happens in the individual soul. Politics is
that which happens in the collectivity. Religion is that which happens
in your aloneness.</p><p><br></p><p>But great ideals go on torturing. India is very heavy-laden – great
rocks are on the Indian heart. And because of those rocks the springs of
life cannot flow.</p><p><br></p><p>So, Kamal, there is no contradiction in it. In fact there is a
logical connectedness between these two things – talking of celibacy,
and giving birth to three children every four seconds. The more you talk
about celibacy, the more sex-obsessed you will become. If you accept sex
as a natural phenomenon, you need not talk about celibacy; it comes in
its own time.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as youth turns into old age, sex turns into celibacy. Celibacy
is sex lived truly, is the fragrance of sex lived truly. Celibacy is
sexuality become mature. Otherwise hypocrisy continues.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditate over this story.</p><p><br></p><p>This man was in bed with a married woman when they heard the door
open. “Oh my God,” she gasped. “It’s my husband! Quick, hidden in the
closet!”</p><p><br></p><p>The man hurried into the closet and closed the door. Suddenly he
heard a small voice saying, “It’s very dark in here.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Who is that?” he asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s my mother out there,” the small voice said. “And now I’m
going to scream.” “Please don’t!” the man said.</p><p>“Okay, but it’ll cost you money,” the boy said. “Here’s five
dollars.”</p><p>“I’m going to scream!” said the small voice. “Okay, here’s ten
dollars!”</p><p>“I’m going to scream,” the small voice said.</p><p>“Here’s twenty dollars.”</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, when the boy turned down thirty-five dollars, the man said,
“All I have is forty dollars.” “I’ll take it.”</p><p>At last, the husband left and the man was able to get out of the
closet and make a hasty exist. That afternoon, the mother took the boy
with her on a shopping trip.</p><p>“I want to get that bicycle,” he said.</p><p><br></p><p>The mother said, “No, you can’t. It costs too much money.” The boy
said, “I’ve got forty dollars.”</p><p>The mother said, “Where would you get forty dollars?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy wouldn’t talk, she began to berate him. He refused to
respond. She slapped his face. He stood stoically. Finally, twisting his
arm, she dragged him into the nearby neighborhood church and approached
the parish priest. “Father, my son has forty dollars and he won’t tell
me where he got it. Maybe you can find out?”</p><p><br></p><p>The priest nodded. He led the boy into a confessional booth. The boy
sat on one side and the priest on the other. The boy said, “It’s very
dark here...”</p><p><br></p><p>And the priest said, “Now, don’t you start that again!”</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

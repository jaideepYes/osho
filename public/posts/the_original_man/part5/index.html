YOUR LONG-HELD CONCEPTIONS AND NOTIONS WILL PERISH, AFTER ABSOLUTE QUESTIONING, IN THE WAY THAT EVERY DROP OF WATER VANISHES FROM A TUB BROKEN OPEN AT THE BOTTOM. PERFECT ENLIGHTENMENT WILL FOLLOW LIKE FLOWERS SUDDENLY BLOOMING ON WITHERED TREES.…\nWHILE YOU ARE DOING ZAZEN, NEITHER DESPISE NOR CHERISH THE THOUGHTS THAT ARISE; ONLY SEARCH YOUR OWN MIND, THE VERY SOURCE OF THESE THOUGHTS. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT ANYTHING APPEARING IN YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS OR SEEN BY YOUR EYES IS AN ILLUSION, OF NO ENDURING REALITY. HENCE YOU SHOULD NEITHER\nFEAR NOR BE FASCINATED BY SUCH PHENOMENA. IF YOU KEEP YOUR MIND AS EMPTY AS SPACE, UNSTAINED BY EXTRANEOUS MATTERS, NO EVIL SPIRITS CAN DISTURB YOU, EVEN ON YOUR DEATHBED. WHILE ENGAGED IN ZAZEN, HOWEVER, KEEP NONE OF THIS COUNSEL IN MIND. YOU MUST ONLY BECOME THE QUESTION, “WHAT IS THIS MIND?” OR, “WHAT IS IT THAT HEARS THESE SOUNDS?” WHEN YOU REALIZE THIS MIND, YOU WILL KNOW THAT IT IS THE VERY SOURCE OF ALL BUDDHAS AND SENTIENT BEINGS.\nAnando, before I say something about Basui’s statements a small preface is needed, because it is very difficult to distinguish a teacher from a master. And it is essential for everyone who is on the path to exactly make that distinction, because both use the same language, and sometimes even the teacher may be more articulate. That is the case with Basui.\nUnfortunately I have to say to you that he is still a teacher and not a master. I am hoping that before the series ends he will come to his senses. It will be difficult for those who have not experienced their innermost consciousness to know where he goes wrong, or where he is just repeating right words. Because even right words when used by the mind become wrong, and even wrong words when used by a master become devices. Anybody who is studying and not meditating, just studying the scriptures and not entering into his own consciousness, will find it very difficult to know whether Basui is a teacher or a master.\nThe master is one who knows. He may not be able to convey it. Most probably he will keep silent; even if he speaks his speech will be leading towards speechlessness. His words are pointing towards a wordless existence. He is not a man of language, he is a man beyond mind.\nBasui’s statements are mixed. A few he must have got from the scriptures because they appear to be exactly right, but the others expose that he has not experienced himself. He is a good spokesman... but a spokesman is just a spokesman! The teacher simply repeats perfectly, like a parrot, the ancient scriptures, sages, buddhas. He is very accurate. Years of training and discipline have made his mind a reservoir of wisdom, but it is all borrowed. Real wisdom can never be borrowed. You can befool people but you cannot convert and transform them. You yourself are not transformed. Your own light is not yet found – how can you transmit the lamp of existential experience?\nBasui is trying his hardest to be on the right lines, but he is helpless. Everybody is helpless. You cannot manage it; a blind man may remember perfectly well where the door is, but still you can see that his movement is hesitant. You can see that with his walking stick he is still trying to find the door. He does not have the right clarity about where the door is. He may have the right description, but he has not got the experience. A blind man can talk about light and about colors, but what does he know about colors, what does he know about rainbows, what does he know about the starry night?\nIt is hard work for me to bring down Basui from his idea of being a master and reduce him to the level of a teacher – a good teacher of course, the best of the kind, showing every sign that sooner or later he will realize that he is repeating borrowed knowledge. The moment you realize that you are repeating borrowed knowledge, that all your mind is borrowed, the mind slips out of your hands. And without taking a single step, you have arrived home.\nThe moment you can say, “I do not know,” you are just an open space, available to existence. Existence starts pouring through you – it is that which you cannot say that you know, it is so vast.\nThe word ‘knowledge’ is very small; it is good for science. The word ‘science’ comes from a root which exactly means knowledge, but the word ‘knowledge’ is not right for the realm of religiousness. There it is too small. Knowledge is tethered to the mind, and wisdom is when the mind has disappeared.\nWith this clarity you have to listen to Basui’s statements. Basui says:\nUPON SUCH REALIZATION, QUESTION YOURSELF EVEN MORE INTENSELY IN THIS WISE...\nNow I will have to point out again and again where he shows that he does not know. If I were to write this sentence I would say that upon such realization all questions drop, but not only questions drop, answers drop also. You are left utterly silent, without any question and without any answer. You just are, a pure sky, unscratched.\nHe is saying, UPON SUCH REALIZATION, QUESTION YOURSELF EVEN MORE INTENSELY...\nAfter realization what is there to question? And if something remains to question after realization, the realization is fake. Realization simply means that you have become one with the universe. Who is going to question whom? You are no more. Realization means that you have dissolved yourself in the vastness of reality. Now who is going to question more intensely?\nAll these things, questioning and questioning intensely, are before realization, not after it. These things can bring you closer to realization, but after realization it is almost like saying to somebody, “When you become healthy, take the medicine more and more.” The medicine was perfectly good when you were sick, but when you are healthy taking it more and more is going to make you sick.\nBasui has no realization of his own, otherwise he could not have said: QUESTION YOURSELF EVEN MORE INTENSELY IN THIS WISE... He even shows the way. He is telling you what question to ask:\nMY BODY IS LIKE A PHANTOM...\nAll these things happen before realization, not after it. After realization all phantoms have disappeared, all shadows have gone. All that is false is no more; only the real shines in its splendor. No question is possible.\nMY BODY IS LIKE A PHANTOM, LIKE BUBBLES ON A STREAM. MY MIND, LOOKING INTO ITSELF, IS AS FORMLESS AS EMPTY SPACE...\nAll these questions are for the disciples, not for the master. He has passed through all that gibberish,\n... YET, SOMEWHERE WITHIN, SOUNDS ARE PERCEIVED. WHO IS HEARING?\nA man of realization is asking such questions? Then what about a man of no realization, what will he ask? Leave something for the unenlightened, don’t take away everything from them.\nThese questions are relevant when you don’t know the watching self, the witnessing self, the innermost eye. Before it everything is absolutely clear. No bubbles arise, no sounds are perceived. It is absolute silence, but very alive; the silence of a garden, not the silence of a graveyard.\nAfter realization there is no point in asking any question – and I am saying this on my own authority. I did not ask a single question; it was impossible to ask. You are so peaceful, so calm, so clear, that that which is false, simply disappears, just as when you bring the light in, the darkness disappears.\nWhen you become aware of yourself, all falseness, all lies, all the personality that you have cultivated around your essential being, drop suddenly. You are standing alone, a luminous flame in which everything false is burned. This luminous flame has only one quality and that quality is watchfulness. You simply watch just like a mirror.\nHave you ever seen a mirror asking, “Why do you have such a Jewish nose? Can’t you manage a little plastic surgery?” The mirror simply says nothing. Whether you have a Jewish nose or a Chinese nose is not the concern of the mirror. Its concern is only to reflect what comes in front of it, not to comment or judge. Judgment is of the mind, commentary is of the mind. The mirror simply watches silently. Everything is okay; the mirror is at ease with everything it reflects. The mirror will not ask you, “Hey man, where did you lose your tail? According to Charles Darwin you should have a tail when you dropped from the trees and became man. Who are you trying to cheat?” It will not ask a monkey, “Why don’t you drop your tail and become a man? Just get a good tailor!”\nSimple things, but the mirror is absolutely silent – rejoicing in whatever is happening without any comment, any recommendations, any questions.\nBut Basui goes on being astray.\nSHOULD YOU QUESTION YOURSELF IN THIS WISE, WITH PROFOUND ABSORPTION, NEVER SLACKENING THE INTENSITY OF YOUR EFFORT...\nThis is too much! Zen is against effort, Zen is a let-go. All the religions of the world are for effort. Hence this statement will not be criticized anywhere except by a man of Zen. Zen is not effort. Effort is tension, effort is work, effort is to achieve something.\nZen is not something to achieve. You are already that. Just relax, relax so deeply that you become a revelation to yourself. Now Basui is going too far away from authentic Zen.\nNEVER SLACKENING THE INTENSITY OF YOUR EFFORT, YOUR RATIONAL MIND EVENTUALLY WILL EXHAUST ITSELF AND ONLY QUESTIONING AT THE DEEPEST LEVEL WILL REMAIN.\nWho will question at the deepest level? If the rational mind is exhausted, there is nobody to question, there is only a mirror simply reflecting.\nPoor Basui still has to go a few rounds of birth and death, unless by chance he meets an authentic master who gives him a good hit on the head and brings him to his senses – “Forget this idea. Do you think you are realized? All your statements make it clear that you don’t know the sky of realization, the space that opens up for a realized man.” What to say about questions, even answers are not found.\nFINALLY YOU WILL LOSE AWARENESS OF YOUR OWN BODY.\nThis is not true. You will never lose awareness at any point. On this great pilgrimage your awareness will become more and more, but never will a point come when you will lose awareness. Awareness is the quality of the mirror. He is saying, FINALLY YOU WILL LOSE AWARENESS OF YOUR OWN BODY. You will certainly lose the identification with the body, but that is not losing awareness of the body. You will know: “This is the body, and I am not connected with it.” But even this much will not be verbal. It will be just like when I can see that you are there, I can never think by mistake that I am sitting there, so I don’t have to drop the idea that I am sitting there.\nOnce you are aware of it you don’t even have to say, “I am not the body.” You are not. You simply see it through and through. You are not the body, nor are you the mind, nor are you the emotions. All these are just reflected in you, but by mistake you have been identifying yourself with them.\nYou were thinking, “My body, my mind...” But your thoughts are not yours, nor is your mind yours, nor is your body yours. What remains when you negate all these identifications? Only a pure awareness, a kind of isness; a being who radiates light, who radiates eternity, who dances with joy that he has come home.\nFINALLY, YOU WILL LOSE AWARENESS OF YOUR OWN BODY. YOUR LONG HELD CONCEPTIONS AND NOTIONS WILL PERISH...\nBasui is really poor. I have compassion for him because all these things have to happen before realization. But this is the problem with a man who has not traveled the path himself but has only collected wisdom from others. He will put things upside down. He does not know which comes first and which comes second.\nYOUR LONG-HELD CONCEPTIONS AND NOTIONS WILL PERISH, AFTER ABSOLUTE QUESTIONING, IN THE WAY THAT EVERY DROP OF WATER VANISHES FROM A TUB BROKEN OPEN AT THE BOTTOM. PERFECT ENLIGHTENMENT...\nNonsense has many forms, stupidity has no limits. Enlightenment as such is perfect, so don’t use ‘perfect’ enlightenment. That is unnecessary repetition. ‘Perfect’ is enough or ‘enlightenment’ is enough, because both are the same.\nUsing ‘perfect’ enlightenment gives the idea that there can be imperfect enlightenment too – fifty percent enlightenment, sixty percent enlightenment. Enlightenment is always one hundred percent, neither less nor more. No buddha is higher than another buddha. The moment you awaken to your being, you have gone beyond all categories, you have melted in the universe where everything is equal. Perhaps Zen is the only real communism.\nThe communism that we hear about from Marx and Engels and their followers is a very poor thing. And it is very unpsychological, because no two men are equal. You cannot find two men who are equal; every man has his own distinct individuality. Hence, on this level of the outside world, equality can only be imposed by force. It was not just because of the character Joseph Stalin, anybody in his place – if he was obsessed with the idea of equality – would have had to do the same. He killed one million Russians in an effort to make them equal.\nI am reminded of a story from old Greek mythology.… A king was very much interested in gold. He prayed for it day and night. Finally, the gods gave him the power that whatever he touched would\nbecome gold. So he touched everything in his house and made it gold. But he lost his wife, he lost his daughter, he lost his son. They all escaped, because if he had touched them... He was really AIDS-positive – the first pioneer!\nHe made a beautiful guest house, but only a few times did somebody become a guest, because in his guest house he had two rules – his whole philosophy was that the world should be filled with gold, and that everybody should be equal.\nHe made a very beautiful bed out of solid gold especially for the guests. But some guests were taller, some guests were smaller, so he had wrestlers to stretch the guest exactly to the size of the bed.\nNaturally, every guest died. You cannot stretch a man according to a measurement. He had decided on the right average size, and everybody had to be equal to the average. But somebody was five inches short... Now if you stretch a man five inches, do you think he will still be alive? Perhaps his head may come off or his legs may give way. But if somebody is bigger than the bed, then the problem is even more difficult. To force him, to press him, all his intestines are destroyed. But the rule had to be followed – equality! He introduced the word ‘equality’ to the world.\nI am not in favor of equality in the outside world because everybody has to be unique and himself. Certainly equal opportunity should be given to everybody – equal opportunity to be unequal. That is a different matter. But in the inner world every buddha is just the same.\nGautam Buddha is reported to have said that if you taste the seawater from anywhere, you will find it has the same taste, the same salty taste. It is exactly the same with buddhahood. You can taste it from one buddha or from another buddha, it does not matter. It gives the same taste, the same fragrance, the same light, the same joy.\nBasui is saying:\nPERFECT ENLIGHTENMENT WILL FOLLOW LIKE FLOWERS SUDDENLY BLOOMING ON WITHERED TREES...\nThere is no perfect enlightenment. Enlightenment is enough unto itself, it needs no perfection. The moment you use ‘perfect’ enlightenment, you are allowing yourself logically, rationally to accept that enlightenment can be of an imperfect quality. But you cannot conceive what kind of enlightenment it will be that is not perfect.\nEnlightenment as such is perfect. Its perfection is intrinsic, so no master can use those two words together, it has to be either perfection or enlightenment. “Perfect enlightenment” is the expression of a teacher who has gathered much knowledge from the scriptures, who is a man of learning but not a man of knowing.\nWHILE YOU ARE DOING ZAZEN...\nThis is why I said that stupidity has no limits. When you have become a buddha, when you are enlightened, for what will you be doing zazen? Once you have learned the alphabet of a language, do you go on all your life learning the alphabet again and again in case you forget?\nI have never come across a man who has forgotten a letter of the alphabet. It is almost impossible. If you can count up to ten, you can count millions and trillions, because they are all repetitions of ten, and you cannot forget that you have ten fingers.\nZazen means sitting in silence watching the mind. Now a buddha cannot do it. In the first place there is no longer any thought left. That’s why he has become a buddha. Now what is he going to watch? The show is over, the people are gone and Gautam Buddha is sitting in his lotus posture watching the screen? Even the projector has been removed. This is great zazen – a real stupidity, one hundred percent pure stupidity.\nZazen is needed for ignorant people who don’t know who they are. Then sitting silently and watching your mind creates the distinction between the thoughts and yourself. You become aware for the first time that there is something beyond the mind – the watcher. You cannot watch the watcher, that is impossible. You cannot go beyond the watcher, the watcher is the limit of the universe. You cannot say that you can watch the watcher – watcher number one watching watcher number two watching watcher number three – you will end up in a madhouse.\nIt happened to a centipede.…\nEarly one spring morning a centipede was going for a walk. A little rabbit was very much puzzled looking from his hole. “My God!” he said. “How does this fellow remember which leg to put first?” He has a hundred legs, that’s why he is called a centipede. He has made the century! You are far away – just two legs and bragging so much.\nHe wondered and worried, and then came out and said, “Uncle, I cannot resist my curiosity. I should not interfere in your morning walk but I have just a small question. How do you manage a hundred legs? Which one first? Which one second?”\nThe centipede said, “The question is valid but I have never thought about it. Let me try.”\nSo he started walking and counting, “One, two, three...” And just as I get lost after three, he got lost. By the fourth he had fallen, and the rabbit ran off because the question had been a disaster. The centipede somehow managed to drag himself to his hole and said to the other centipedes, “If somebody asks you how you manage your legs, never answer the question. They manage themselves! It is not our work, it is not our effort, our management.”\nBasui is saying that when you are a buddha, self-realized, you should sit doing zazen. NEITHER DESPISE NOR CHERISH THE THOUGHTS THAT ARISE.\nCan you see his problem? He has read many scriptures and collected fragments from here and there, and now he does not know which leg to put first and which leg to put second. The last leg he has put first. He begins with: UPON SUCH REALIZATION... After that nothing has to be said, but he goes on to say everything that should come before realization.\nAll these things are valid, but in their place, in their context, not just anywhere. And I don’t think that he has ever done zazen, because he says:\nNEITHER DESPISE NOR CHERISH THE THOUGHTS THAT ARISE; ONLY SEARCH YOUR OWN MIND, THE VERY SOURCE OF THESE THOUGHTS. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT ANYTHING APPEARING IN YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS OR SEEN BY YOUR EYES IS AN ILLUSION, OF NO ENDURING REALITY...\nAll these things are perfectly right, but in a wrong place.\nHENCE YOU SHOULD NEITHER FEAR NOR BE FASCINATED BY SUCH PHENOMENA.\nThe whole world thinks that the man of realization still meditates, but the world is wrong. Once meditation is fulfilled, once you have reached to the point of knowing that you are a pure awareness beyond mind, beyond all thoughts, this very experience of beyondness disperses all clouds from the sky. Then you don’t have to do all the work that he is suggesting.\nHENCE YOU SHOULD NEITHER FEAR NOR BE FASCINATED BY SUCH PHENOMENA. IF YOU KEEP YOUR MIND AS EMPTY AS SPACE, UNSTAINED BY EXTRANEOUS MATTERS, NO EVIL SPIRITS CAN DISTURB YOU, EVEN ON YOUR DEATHBED.\nA man of realization knows there is no death. Death is a fiction, you have never died. Yes, you have changed your form many times. You have changed your house many times, many times. But you have never died. Have you ever seen yourself dying? It is always somebody else who dies.\nThat’s why you go on enjoying all kinds of stupid things – football, television rubbish... and people are glued...! An American survey says that everybody is glued to the chair in front of the television for seven and a half hours per day, and naturally meanwhile eating all kinds of things.\nSo they have created a television potato association. And thousands of Americans have joined the association, have become members.\nThe only thing is – it is bound to happen – you will become a potato. For seven and a half hours sitting in your seat pushing all kinds of rubbish – ice cream, Coca Cola... keeping the fridge just within your reach – you will turn into a potato. Soon you will see the world full of potatoes.\nSomebody suggested to me that the tomato would be far better. I said, “Why tomato? A potato is at least harder. If a tomato gets so much rubbish, it will burst out – it has a very thin skin – then from all over, somewhere ice cream is coming out, somewhere else Coca Cola is coming out. Tomatoes cannot manage it. Potatoes are harder people.”\nA man doing zazen comes to the point of realizing that whatever is seen is phenomenal. It is made of just the same stuff as dreams are made of. Everything goes on changing. That is the Eastern definition of reality and unreality. The unreal is simply the one that changes.\nYou were a child, you have become a grown-up, you will become old. This is phenomenal, this is unreal. But there is something within you which never becomes anything other than itself. In your childhood it is the same, in your youth it is the same, in your old age it is the same, in your death it is the same. A man of meditation knows his eternal being, his immortal being. There is no deathbed for him.\nWHILE ENGAGED IN ZAZEN, HOWEVER, KEEP NONE OF THIS COUNSEL IN MIND...\nHe knows not even the ABC of zazen. He is saying that while doing zazen you should not keep any part of what he has described in your mind. But a man who has experienced zazen simply knows that whatever comes in front of the eyes is just phenomenal. It comes and goes, just like clouds come and go, flowers come and go. Everything in the world except your being goes on moving into new forms.\nTo find yourself is to find the center of the cyclone. The whole world is a cyclone. But once you have found the center, the cyclone disappears. The mirror remains empty. This emptiness is buddhahood. This nothingness is the ultimate peak of consciousness.\nI hope that this fellow forgets all that he has learned and begins to meditate. Knowledge, howsoever valuable, is useless in transforming you. Only your own experience, your own fire, can transform you. And you have the fire, everybody is born with it. You just have to turn yourself inwards.\nI hope that Basui may have turned inwards by now. If not then he will have to come here. Because now, even in Japan, Zen has become just a scholarly study. Zen is not a scholarly study. Zen is an existential quantum leap. It is not of the mind. It is going beyond the mind.\nDogen, a Zen master, wrote:\nSCARECROW IN THE HILLOCK. PADDY FIELD –\nHOW UNAWARE! HOW USEFUL!\nA scarecrow is a false man which farmers make just by putting up a bamboo and covering the top with a mud pot, as if it is a monk’s head, perfectly shaven. Then they put another bamboo just like a cross and cover the cross with a robe, and put two hands on it. It is to create fear in wild animals.\nSometimes in moonlit nights even the scarecrow looks so beautiful, and certainly it is useful. But it is not a true man. So if a thing is useful it does not mean it is true, and vice versa: if it is true it does not mean that it may prove useful. What use is enlightenment? You cannot sell it. Even if you want to, even if you can find somebody to purchase it, there is no way of selling it. What use is enlightenment?\nUtility is not the goal of life. The goal of life is a deep relaxation from all effort, being in a dance with the dancing trees, with the dancing stars, rejoicing in existence without any worry, without any mind, just being part of the cosmos.\nDogen is right, “Scarecrow in the hillock. Paddy field – how unaware...”\nThe poor fellow is absolutely unaware. But that is the situation of all of us. We are just scarecrows – hung up on a skeleton and covered with a skin bag.\nThey have invented, and they are already making man-made men, robots. They will be perfectly good, in fact they will be more efficient than you. The only problem is when their battery runs out. Otherwise you will not be able to know... a person is saying to you, “I love you, sweetheart,” and then rrrrr, rrrr... his battery runs out, and you suddenly become aware, “My God, it is a robot.” Otherwise he had the whole program, the whole dialogue, computerized. He can do many things, he is very useful.\nJust a few days ago in Japan, in a factory where they were using robots, an accident happened which may determine the future of robots in the coming century. Robots can work twenty-four hours at a time. They don’t need Sundays or any other holiday. They don’t go on strike, they don’t ask for any raise. They are very good people, nice and gentlemanly. And they work continuously. One robot can do the work of almost one thousand people in the same time period. But in a factory where a few robots were used experimentally, something went wrong.\nIt always happens with electricity – something goes wrong. Something went wrong and six robots just clutched at the nearest human being who was passing by, and hugged him. It was not in their program, and a robot hug? – the man was finished.\nYou cannot survive after a robot hug. You will have so many fractures that it will not be worth hospitalizing you. They are still trying to find out what happened. Something went wrong because it was not only one, but six robots, all of whom were working in the factory. Suddenly a great love for humanity arose – and they don’t believe in heterosexuality or homosexuality; it doesn’t matter... Anybody who was moving around, they simply pulled him close, gave him a good hug and finished him.\nIt has been known to biologists that there are a few spiders in Africa which are a very rare species, but very significant. When the male mounts the female, making love – maybe he is talking in their language all kinds of movie dialogues – when he comes onto her, the lady underneath starts eating the fellow. That spider makes love only once in his life, then his work is finished. But he has a great orgasm. He is trembling on long legs and the lady is eating him and he is in such ecstasy. He cannot even escape. Each love becomes death.\nPerhaps it is very symbolic. If robots get mixed up in humanity, they will have everything that you have. The only thing will be that they will be running on batteries, so it depends on the battery, how powerful it is. If a robot makes love to a woman it will depend on his battery. After it that woman will never be satisfied by any man because human batteries are very small. There is human electricity in the body but a very small quantity.\nMan is not just a utility, that can be done by machines, by robots. Man is a dance, a song, for no purpose at all. Do you think a rose has any purpose? Do you think a lotus has any purpose? Do you think these millions of stars have any purpose? Just out of sheer joy the whole existence is dancing. A man of meditation comes to the same point. He starts dancing in utter ecstasy and joy without any purpose. This kind of man may love you, he may have compassion, he may be creative but all for sheer joy. Only for a buddha is art for art’s sake. For everybody else art is a commodity to be sold in the marketplace.\nAnother Zen poem:\nTHE MIND CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA; THE BODY CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA.\nONLY WHAT CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA CAN BECOME THE BUDDHA.\nWhat are the ingredients in you? The body cannot become the buddha, the mind cannot become the buddha. Apart from body and mind is there something else within you? That is what I am calling watchfulness, awareness, witnessing. Only that, but that also cannot become the buddha, it already is the buddha. It is a very beautiful poem and it shows that the man understands what he is saying.…\nTHE MIND CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA; THE BODY CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA. ONLY WHAT CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA CAN BECOME THE BUDDHA.\nThat last part will look like a puzzle to anybody who does not understand his own awareness. You don’t have to become a buddha. You already are a buddha, you just have to discover it. You are covered with a body, you are covered with a mind. You just have to discover yourself, you don’t have to become. You just have to recognize. You just have to penetrate within your body and mind, reaching to the innermost core – and suddenly you are the buddha. It is not that you have become a buddha, you are a fully-fledged buddha already. You have just not looked inside yourself.\nQuestion 1\nAnando has asked a question:\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\nLAST NIGHT YOU SAID THAT THE TRANSMISSION CAN HAPPEN IN A SECOND, THAT YOU REACH OUT TO US EVERY DAY – BUT STILL OUR DOORS ARE CLOSED. SO MANY OF US HAVE BEEN WITH YOU SO MANY YEARS; YOU HAVE MELTED OUR HEARTS SO MANY TIMES. CAN IT BE THAT OUR DOORS HAVE SOMEHOW RUSTED SHUT?\nAnando, saying that your doors are closed is only symbolic. You don’t have any doors. They cannot be rusted shut.\nHave I told you the famous anecdote about Rabiya al-Adabiya?\nShe was a Sufi master, very rare because she was a woman, and very unique, almost like a Bodhidharma. She never went to the mosque and people used to ask her, “You are so religious, so simple, so innocent. Why don’t you come to the mosque?”\nShe said, “What is the purpose now? The mosque is for you because you are not sincere and you are not simple. It is not for me. I have found my home.” One day she was passing by the mosque and a man named Hassan, who afterwards became a great master himself, was praying in front of the steps with both his hands raised, kneeling down on the ground: “God, when will you listen to me? Why don’t you open the door?”\nWhen Rabiya heard it, she hit Hassan and told him, “You idiot, there are no doors! And to whom are you praying? There is nobody in the sky to answer your question. Just go home and look inwards – there are no doors.”\nNothing is preventing you except your own desire to remain outside, maybe to have a little more money, a little more political power, a little more influence in the world, a little more of a name to be written in the history books. This is all trivia. Just remember not to get caught by this trivia. Enter into yourself and the buddha is there.\nPerfect! There is nothing missing in it. Before we enter again tonight – because it is a dangerous journey... You may find the buddha and may not come out, but I take the risk, because I will be responsible before the court: “You told people to go in and they have gone. Now pull them out!” It is very difficult. So you have to remember, when I say come out, come out!\nGoing in is very easy. But the inside is so beautiful and so alluring that you may decide – what is the point of coming out? Please don’t do that because I will be responsible. So just see the buddha, understand that he is there, but when Nivedano gives you the drumbeat to come back, don’t hesitate. Just come back slowly, gracefully, remembering the buddha. Keep the remembrance around your twenty-four-hour life, in your actions, in your gestures, in your words, in your silences.\nBut please, this one thing you have to remember: don’t get stuck there inside, because then nobody can pull you out; no operation will help. If you decide to be in, finished! Then we will just have to make a ceremony, that one man has become a buddha. We don’t say that anybody has died because here nobody dies. Up to now only three persons have become buddhas. Death is a fiction.\nBut there is no need and no hurry. Enjoy going in every evening just like going for an evening walk. Enjoy, relish, be nourished and let this experience transform your whole outer life. But one never knows what you will decide when you are inside. You will be alone.\nSo before that, a few good laughters, perhaps just those laughters will bring you out: “Let us have one night more, a few laughters more. Perhaps our master will tell some jokes tomorrow and I will not be here.” Remember it!\nMad Marvin escapes from the crazyhouse and runs to a nearby town. He is seen standing by an old well, dancing and shouting, “Five! Five! Five!”\nCurious, Officer Chump, the local cop, saunters over to Marvin.\n“What is all this noise about?” inquires the cop.\n“Look!” exclaims Mad Marvin, pointing into the well. “Look! Five! Five! Five!”\nOfficer Chump shakes his head at the looney, and just to humor him, steps up to the well. Then, with a wide grin and a big push, Mad Marvin shouts, “Six! Six! Six!”\nNivedano... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)\nBe silent, close your eyes. Sit just as a buddha, a frozen statue, no movement.\nGather your consciousness inwards. Go deeper and deeperAt the very center of your being is\nyour enlightenment.\nThis very moment, being at the center in such tremendous silence, you are a buddha. You don’t have to become a buddha, you just have to discover. You have only forgotten, you have just to remember.\nDon’t be afraid, this is your space.\nYou will not meet anybody on the way except your own being in all its glory and splendor, in all its eternity, beauty, truth.\nEverybody is carrying the ultimate treasure within himself. To make it more clear.…\nNivedano... (Drumbeat)\nRelax, let the body and the mind remain there. Withdraw your identification, just be a watcher. Watching is the secret key.\nIt opens the doors of all that is mystery, all that is miracle.\nRejoice in it and remember the path, the way, by which you have come to this point, so that at any time you want you can enter in and get refreshed.\nBring out your buddhahood in your actions, in your gestures, in your responses.\nJust this small thing of entering into your own center is the whole religion – everything else follows on its own accord. When things happen spontaneously, they have a beauty of their own.\nNivedano... (Drumbeat)\nCome back. Resurrect slowly, keeping your awareness, your remembrance. Sit down like a buddha for a few seconds.\nThis is an ever-deepening process. It is not that one day you become buddha and the pilgrimage is finished. You go on becoming more and more, your depth goes on becoming deeper and deeper, your clarity becomes absolutely dustless.\nIt is the greatest phenomenon in the world to experience your buddhahood and act it in your ordinary life.\nOkay, Anando?\nYes, Beloved Master.\nCan we celebrate the gathering of ten thousand buddhas? Yes!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6465","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_original_man/part5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_original_man/>The Original Man</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">5 The sky of realisation</h1><div class=post-meta>31 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6465 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Original_Man/part5.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

WISE: “MY BODY IS LIKE A PHANTOM, LIKE BUBBLES ON A STREAM. MY MIND,
LOOKING INTO ITSELF, IS AS FORMLESS AS EMPTY SPACE, YET SOMEWHERE
WITHIN, SOUNDS ARE PERCEIVED. WHO IS HEARING?”</p><p><br></p><p>SHOULD YOU QUESTION YOURSELF IN THIS WISE, WITH PROFOUND ABSORPTION,
NEVER SLACKENING THE INTENSITY OF YOUR EFFORT, YOUR RATIONAL MIND
EVENTUALLY WILL EXHAUST ITSELF AND ONLY QUESTIONING AT THE DEEPEST LEVEL
WILL REMAIN.</p><p><br></p><p>FINALLY, YOU WILL LOSE AWARENESS OF YOUR OWN BODY. YOUR LONG-HELD
CONCEPTIONS AND NOTIONS WILL PERISH, AFTER ABSOLUTE QUESTIONING, IN THE
WAY THAT EVERY DROP OF WATER VANISHES FROM A TUB BROKEN OPEN AT THE
BOTTOM. PERFECT ENLIGHTENMENT WILL FOLLOW LIKE FLOWERS SUDDENLY BLOOMING
ON WITHERED TREES.…</p><p><br></p><p>WHILE YOU ARE DOING ZAZEN, NEITHER DESPISE NOR CHERISH THE THOUGHTS
THAT ARISE; ONLY SEARCH YOUR OWN MIND, THE VERY SOURCE OF THESE
THOUGHTS. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT ANYTHING APPEARING IN YOUR
CONSCIOUSNESS OR SEEN BY YOUR EYES IS AN ILLUSION, OF NO ENDURING
REALITY. HENCE YOU SHOULD NEITHER</p><p>FEAR NOR BE FASCINATED BY SUCH PHENOMENA. IF YOU KEEP YOUR MIND AS
EMPTY AS SPACE, UNSTAINED BY EXTRANEOUS MATTERS, NO EVIL SPIRITS CAN
DISTURB YOU, EVEN ON YOUR DEATHBED. WHILE ENGAGED IN ZAZEN, HOWEVER,
KEEP NONE OF THIS COUNSEL IN MIND. YOU MUST ONLY BECOME THE QUESTION,
“WHAT IS THIS MIND?” OR, “WHAT IS IT THAT HEARS THESE SOUNDS?” WHEN YOU
REALIZE THIS MIND, YOU WILL KNOW THAT IT IS THE VERY SOURCE OF ALL
BUDDHAS AND SENTIENT BEINGS.</p><p><br></p><p>Anando, before I say something about Basui’s statements a small
preface is needed, because it is very difficult to distinguish a teacher
from a master. And it is essential for everyone who is on the path to
exactly make that distinction, because both use the same language, and
sometimes even the teacher may be more articulate. That is the case with
Basui.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately I have to say to you that he is still a teacher and not
a master. I am hoping that before the series ends he will come to his
senses. It will be difficult for those who have not experienced their
innermost consciousness to know where he goes wrong, or where he is just
repeating right words. Because even right words when used by the mind
become wrong, and even wrong words when used by a master become devices.
Anybody who is studying and not meditating, just studying the scriptures
and not entering into his own consciousness, will find it very difficult
to know whether Basui is a teacher or a master.</p><p><br></p><p>The master is one who knows. He may not be able to convey it. Most
probably he will keep silent; even if he speaks his speech will be
leading towards speechlessness. His words are pointing towards a
wordless existence. He is not a man of language, he is a man beyond
mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Basui’s statements are mixed. A few he must have got from the
scriptures because they appear to be exactly right, but the others
expose that he has not experienced himself. He is a good spokesman...
but a spokesman is just a spokesman! The teacher simply repeats
perfectly, like a parrot, the ancient scriptures, sages, buddhas. He is
very accurate. Years of training and discipline have made his mind a
reservoir of wisdom, but it is all borrowed. Real wisdom can never be
borrowed. You can befool people but you cannot convert and transform
them. You yourself are not transformed. Your own light is not yet found
– how can you transmit the lamp of existential experience?</p><p><br></p><p>Basui is trying his hardest to be on the right lines, but he is
helpless. Everybody is helpless. You cannot manage it; a blind man may
remember perfectly well where the door is, but still you can see that
his movement is hesitant. You can see that with his walking stick he is
still trying to find the door. He does not have the right clarity about
where the door is. He may have the right description, but he has not got
the experience. A blind man can talk about light and about colors, but
what does he know about colors, what does he know about rainbows, what
does he know about the starry night?</p><p><br></p><p>It is hard work for me to bring down Basui from his idea of being a
master and reduce him to the level of a teacher – a good teacher of
course, the best of the kind, showing every sign that sooner or later he
will realize that he is repeating borrowed knowledge. The moment you
realize that you are repeating borrowed knowledge, that all your mind is
borrowed, the mind slips out of your hands. And without taking a single
step, you have arrived home.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment you can say, “I do not know,” you are just an open space,
available to existence. Existence starts pouring through you – it is
that which you cannot say that you know, it is so vast.</p><p>The word ‘knowledge’ is very small; it is good for science. The word
‘science’ comes from a root which exactly means knowledge, but the word
‘knowledge’ is not right for the realm of religiousness. There it is too
small. Knowledge is tethered to the mind, and wisdom is when the mind
has disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>With this clarity you have to listen to Basui’s statements. Basui
says:</p><p><br></p><p>UPON SUCH REALIZATION, QUESTION YOURSELF EVEN MORE INTENSELY IN THIS
WISE...</p><p><br></p><p>Now I will have to point out again and again where he shows that he
does not know. If I were to write this sentence I would say that upon
such realization all questions drop, but not only questions drop,
answers drop also. You are left utterly silent, without any question and
without any answer. You just are, a pure sky, unscratched.</p><p><br></p><p>He is saying, UPON SUCH REALIZATION, QUESTION YOURSELF EVEN MORE
INTENSELY...</p><p>After realization what is there to question? And if something remains
to question after realization, the realization is fake. Realization
simply means that you have become one with the universe. Who is going to
question whom? You are no more. Realization means that you have
dissolved yourself in the vastness of reality. Now who is going to
question more intensely?</p><p><br></p><p>All these things, questioning and questioning intensely, are before
realization, not after it. These things can bring you closer to
realization, but after realization it is almost like saying to somebody,
“When you become healthy, take the medicine more and more.” The medicine
was perfectly good when you were sick, but when you are healthy taking
it more and more is going to make you sick.</p><p><br></p><p>Basui has no realization of his own, otherwise he could not have
said: QUESTION YOURSELF EVEN MORE INTENSELY IN THIS WISE... He even
shows the way. He is telling you what question to ask:</p><p><br></p><p>MY BODY IS LIKE A PHANTOM...</p><p><br></p><p>All these things happen before realization, not after it. After
realization all phantoms have disappeared, all shadows have gone. All
that is false is no more; only the real shines in its splendor. No
question is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>MY BODY IS LIKE A PHANTOM, LIKE BUBBLES ON A STREAM. MY MIND, LOOKING
INTO ITSELF, IS AS FORMLESS AS EMPTY SPACE...</p><p><br></p><p>All these questions are for the disciples, not for the master. He has
passed through all that gibberish,</p><p><br></p><p>... YET, SOMEWHERE WITHIN, SOUNDS ARE PERCEIVED. WHO IS HEARING?</p><p><br></p><p>A man of realization is asking such questions? Then what about a man
of no realization, what will he ask? Leave something for the
unenlightened, don’t take away everything from them.</p><p><br></p><p>These questions are relevant when you don’t know the watching self,
the witnessing self, the innermost eye. Before it everything is
absolutely clear. No bubbles arise, no sounds are perceived. It is
absolute silence, but very alive; the silence of a garden, not the
silence of a graveyard.</p><p>After realization there is no point in asking any question – and I am
saying this on my own authority. I did not ask a single question; it was
impossible to ask. You are so peaceful, so calm, so clear, that that
which is false, simply disappears, just as when you bring the light in,
the darkness disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>When you become aware of yourself, all falseness, all lies, all the
personality that you have cultivated around your essential being, drop
suddenly. You are standing alone, a luminous flame in which everything
false is burned. This luminous flame has only one quality and that
quality is watchfulness. You simply watch just like a mirror.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever seen a mirror asking, “Why do you have such a Jewish
nose? Can’t you manage a little plastic surgery?” The mirror simply says
nothing. Whether you have a Jewish nose or a Chinese nose is not the
concern of the mirror. Its concern is only to reflect what comes in
front of it, not to comment or judge. Judgment is of the mind,
commentary is of the mind. The mirror simply watches silently.
Everything is okay; the mirror is at ease with everything it reflects.
The mirror will not ask you, “Hey man, where did you lose your tail?
According to Charles Darwin you should have a tail when you dropped from
the trees and became man. Who are you trying to cheat?” It will not ask
a monkey, “Why don’t you drop your tail and become a man? Just get a
good tailor!”</p><p><br></p><p>Simple things, but the mirror is absolutely silent – rejoicing in
whatever is happening without any comment, any recommendations, any
questions.</p><p><br></p><p>But Basui goes on being astray.</p><p><br></p><p>SHOULD YOU QUESTION YOURSELF IN THIS WISE, WITH PROFOUND ABSORPTION,
NEVER SLACKENING THE INTENSITY OF YOUR EFFORT...</p><p><br></p><p>This is too much! Zen is against effort, Zen is a let-go. All the
religions of the world are for effort. Hence this statement will not be
criticized anywhere except by a man of Zen. Zen is not effort. Effort is
tension, effort is work, effort is to achieve something.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen is not something to achieve. You are already that. Just relax,
relax so deeply that you become a revelation to yourself. Now Basui is
going too far away from authentic Zen.</p><p><br></p><p>NEVER SLACKENING THE INTENSITY OF YOUR EFFORT, YOUR RATIONAL MIND
EVENTUALLY WILL EXHAUST ITSELF AND ONLY QUESTIONING AT THE DEEPEST LEVEL
WILL REMAIN.</p><p><br></p><p>Who will question at the deepest level? If the rational mind is
exhausted, there is nobody to question, there is only a mirror simply
reflecting.</p><p><br></p><p>Poor Basui still has to go a few rounds of birth and death, unless by
chance he meets an authentic master who gives him a good hit on the head
and brings him to his senses – “Forget this idea. Do you think you are
realized? All your statements make it clear that you don’t know the sky
of realization, the space that opens up for a realized man.” What to say
about questions, even answers are not found.</p><p><br></p><p>FINALLY YOU WILL LOSE AWARENESS OF YOUR OWN BODY.</p><p>This is not true. You will never lose awareness at any point. On this
great pilgrimage your awareness will become more and more, but never
will a point come when you will lose awareness. Awareness is the quality
of the mirror. He is saying, FINALLY YOU WILL LOSE AWARENESS OF YOUR OWN
BODY. You will certainly lose the identification with the body, but that
is not losing awareness of the body. You will know: “This is the body,
and I am not connected with it.” But even this much will not be verbal.
It will be just like when I can see that you are there, I can never
think by mistake that I am sitting there, so I don’t have to drop the
idea that I am sitting there.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you are aware of it you don’t even have to say, “I am not the
body.” You are not. You simply see it through and through. You are not
the body, nor are you the mind, nor are you the emotions. All these are
just reflected in you, but by mistake you have been identifying yourself
with them.</p><p><br></p><p>You were thinking, “My body, my mind...” But your thoughts are not
yours, nor is your mind yours, nor is your body yours. What remains when
you negate all these identifications? Only a pure awareness, a kind of
isness; a being who radiates light, who radiates eternity, who dances
with joy that he has come home.</p><p><br></p><p>FINALLY, YOU WILL LOSE AWARENESS OF YOUR OWN BODY. YOUR LONG HELD
CONCEPTIONS AND NOTIONS WILL PERISH...</p><p><br></p><p>Basui is really poor. I have compassion for him because all these
things have to happen before realization. But this is the problem with a
man who has not traveled the path himself but has only collected wisdom
from others. He will put things upside down. He does not know which
comes first and which comes second.</p><p><br></p><p>YOUR LONG-HELD CONCEPTIONS AND NOTIONS WILL PERISH, AFTER ABSOLUTE
QUESTIONING, IN THE WAY THAT EVERY DROP OF WATER VANISHES FROM A TUB
BROKEN OPEN AT THE BOTTOM. PERFECT ENLIGHTENMENT...</p><p><br></p><p>Nonsense has many forms, stupidity has no limits. Enlightenment as
such is perfect, so don’t use ‘perfect’ enlightenment. That is
unnecessary repetition. ‘Perfect’ is enough or ‘enlightenment’ is
enough, because both are the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Using ‘perfect’ enlightenment gives the idea that there can be
imperfect enlightenment too – fifty percent enlightenment, sixty percent
enlightenment. Enlightenment is always one hundred percent, neither less
nor more. No buddha is higher than another buddha. The moment you awaken
to your being, you have gone beyond all categories, you have melted in
the universe where everything is equal. Perhaps Zen is the only real
communism.</p><p><br></p><p>The communism that we hear about from Marx and Engels and their
followers is a very poor thing. And it is very unpsychological, because
no two men are equal. You cannot find two men who are equal; every man
has his own distinct individuality. Hence, on this level of the outside
world, equality can only be imposed by force. It was not just because of
the character Joseph Stalin, anybody in his place – if he was obsessed
with the idea of equality – would have had to do the same. He killed one
million Russians in an effort to make them equal.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of a story from old Greek mythology.… A king was very
much interested in gold. He prayed for it day and night. Finally, the
gods gave him the power that whatever he touched would</p><p>become gold. So he touched everything in his house and made it gold.
But he lost his wife, he lost his daughter, he lost his son. They all
escaped, because if he had touched them... He was really AIDS-positive –
the first pioneer!</p><p><br></p><p>He made a beautiful guest house, but only a few times did somebody
become a guest, because in his guest house he had two rules – his whole
philosophy was that the world should be filled with gold, and that
everybody should be equal.</p><p><br></p><p>He made a very beautiful bed out of solid gold especially for the
guests. But some guests were taller, some guests were smaller, so he had
wrestlers to stretch the guest exactly to the size of the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally, every guest died. You cannot stretch a man according to a
measurement. He had decided on the right average size, and everybody had
to be equal to the average. But somebody was five inches short... Now if
you stretch a man five inches, do you think he will still be alive?
Perhaps his head may come off or his legs may give way. But if somebody
is bigger than the bed, then the problem is even more difficult. To
force him, to press him, all his intestines are destroyed. But the rule
had to be followed – equality! He introduced the word ‘equality’ to the
world.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not in favor of equality in the outside world because everybody
has to be unique and himself. Certainly equal opportunity should be
given to everybody – equal opportunity to be unequal. That is a
different matter. But in the inner world every buddha is just the
same.</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha is reported to have said that if you taste the seawater
from anywhere, you will find it has the same taste, the same salty
taste. It is exactly the same with buddhahood. You can taste it from one
buddha or from another buddha, it does not matter. It gives the same
taste, the same fragrance, the same light, the same joy.</p><p><br></p><p>Basui is saying:</p><p><br></p><p>PERFECT ENLIGHTENMENT WILL FOLLOW LIKE FLOWERS SUDDENLY BLOOMING ON
WITHERED TREES...</p><p><br></p><p>There is no perfect enlightenment. Enlightenment is enough unto
itself, it needs no perfection. The moment you use ‘perfect’
enlightenment, you are allowing yourself logically, rationally to accept
that enlightenment can be of an imperfect quality. But you cannot
conceive what kind of enlightenment it will be that is not perfect.</p><p><br></p><p>Enlightenment as such is perfect. Its perfection is intrinsic, so no
master can use those two words together, it has to be either perfection
or enlightenment. “Perfect enlightenment” is the expression of a teacher
who has gathered much knowledge from the scriptures, who is a man of
learning but not a man of knowing.</p><p><br></p><p>WHILE YOU ARE DOING ZAZEN...</p><p><br></p><p>This is why I said that stupidity has no limits. When you have become
a buddha, when you are enlightened, for what will you be doing zazen?
Once you have learned the alphabet of a language, do you go on all your
life learning the alphabet again and again in case you forget?</p><p>I have never come across a man who has forgotten a letter of the
alphabet. It is almost impossible. If you can count up to ten, you can
count millions and trillions, because they are all repetitions of ten,
and you cannot forget that you have ten fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>Zazen means sitting in silence watching the mind. Now a buddha cannot
do it. In the first place there is no longer any thought left. That’s
why he has become a buddha. Now what is he going to watch? The show is
over, the people are gone and Gautam Buddha is sitting in his lotus
posture watching the screen? Even the projector has been removed. This
is great zazen – a real stupidity, one hundred percent pure
stupidity.</p><p><br></p><p>Zazen is needed for ignorant people who don’t know who they are. Then
sitting silently and watching your mind creates the distinction between
the thoughts and yourself. You become aware for the first time that
there is something beyond the mind – the watcher. You cannot watch the
watcher, that is impossible. You cannot go beyond the watcher, the
watcher is the limit of the universe. You cannot say that you can watch
the watcher – watcher number one watching watcher number two watching
watcher number three – you will end up in a madhouse.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened to a centipede.…</p><p><br></p><p>Early one spring morning a centipede was going for a walk. A little
rabbit was very much puzzled looking from his hole. “My God!” he said.
“How does this fellow remember which leg to put first?” He has a hundred
legs, that’s why he is called a centipede. He has made the century! You
are far away – just two legs and bragging so much.</p><p><br></p><p>He wondered and worried, and then came out and said, “Uncle, I cannot
resist my curiosity. I should not interfere in your morning walk but I
have just a small question. How do you manage a hundred legs? Which one
first? Which one second?”</p><p><br></p><p>The centipede said, “The question is valid but I have never thought
about it. Let me try.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he started walking and counting, “One, two, three...” And just as
I get lost after three, he got lost. By the fourth he had fallen, and
the rabbit ran off because the question had been a disaster. The
centipede somehow managed to drag himself to his hole and said to the
other centipedes, “If somebody asks you how you manage your legs, never
answer the question. They manage themselves! It is not our work, it is
not our effort, our management.”</p><p><br></p><p>Basui is saying that when you are a buddha, self-realized, you should
sit doing zazen. NEITHER DESPISE NOR CHERISH THE THOUGHTS THAT
ARISE.</p><p>Can you see his problem? He has read many scriptures and collected
fragments from here and there, and now he does not know which leg to put
first and which leg to put second. The last leg he has put first. He
begins with: UPON SUCH REALIZATION... After that nothing has to be said,
but he goes on to say everything that should come before
realization.</p><p><br></p><p>All these things are valid, but in their place, in their context, not
just anywhere. And I don’t think that he has ever done zazen, because he
says:</p><p>NEITHER DESPISE NOR CHERISH THE THOUGHTS THAT ARISE; ONLY SEARCH YOUR
OWN MIND, THE VERY SOURCE OF THESE THOUGHTS. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT
ANYTHING APPEARING IN YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS OR SEEN BY YOUR EYES IS AN
ILLUSION, OF NO ENDURING REALITY...</p><p><br></p><p>All these things are perfectly right, but in a wrong place.</p><p><br></p><p>HENCE YOU SHOULD NEITHER FEAR NOR BE FASCINATED BY SUCH
PHENOMENA.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole world thinks that the man of realization still meditates,
but the world is wrong. Once meditation is fulfilled, once you have
reached to the point of knowing that you are a pure awareness beyond
mind, beyond all thoughts, this very experience of beyondness disperses
all clouds from the sky. Then you don’t have to do all the work that he
is suggesting.</p><p><br></p><p>HENCE YOU SHOULD NEITHER FEAR NOR BE FASCINATED BY SUCH PHENOMENA. IF
YOU KEEP YOUR MIND AS EMPTY AS SPACE, UNSTAINED BY EXTRANEOUS MATTERS,
NO EVIL SPIRITS CAN DISTURB YOU, EVEN ON YOUR DEATHBED.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of realization knows there is no death. Death is a fiction, you
have never died. Yes, you have changed your form many times. You have
changed your house many times, many times. But you have never died. Have
you ever seen yourself dying? It is always somebody else who dies.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why you go on enjoying all kinds of stupid things – football,
television rubbish... and people are glued...! An American survey says
that everybody is glued to the chair in front of the television for
seven and a half hours per day, and naturally meanwhile eating all kinds
of things.</p><p><br></p><p>So they have created a television potato association. And thousands
of Americans have joined the association, have become members.</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing is – it is bound to happen – you will become a potato.
For seven and a half hours sitting in your seat pushing all kinds of
rubbish – ice cream, Coca Cola... keeping the fridge just within your
reach – you will turn into a potato. Soon you will see the world full of
potatoes.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody suggested to me that the tomato would be far better. I said,
“Why tomato? A potato is at least harder. If a tomato gets so much
rubbish, it will burst out – it has a very thin skin – then from all
over, somewhere ice cream is coming out, somewhere else Coca Cola is
coming out. Tomatoes cannot manage it. Potatoes are harder people.”</p><p><br></p><p>A man doing zazen comes to the point of realizing that whatever is
seen is phenomenal. It is made of just the same stuff as dreams are made
of. Everything goes on changing. That is the Eastern definition of
reality and unreality. The unreal is simply the one that changes.</p><p><br></p><p>You were a child, you have become a grown-up, you will become old.
This is phenomenal, this is unreal. But there is something within you
which never becomes anything other than itself. In your childhood it is
the same, in your youth it is the same, in your old age it is the same,
in your death it is the same. A man of meditation knows his eternal
being, his immortal being. There is no deathbed for him.</p><p>WHILE ENGAGED IN ZAZEN, HOWEVER, KEEP NONE OF THIS COUNSEL IN
MIND...</p><p><br></p><p>He knows not even the ABC of zazen. He is saying that while doing
zazen you should not keep any part of what he has described in your
mind. But a man who has experienced zazen simply knows that whatever
comes in front of the eyes is just phenomenal. It comes and goes, just
like clouds come and go, flowers come and go. Everything in the world
except your being goes on moving into new forms.</p><p><br></p><p>To find yourself is to find the center of the cyclone. The whole
world is a cyclone. But once you have found the center, the cyclone
disappears. The mirror remains empty. This emptiness is buddhahood. This
nothingness is the ultimate peak of consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>I hope that this fellow forgets all that he has learned and begins to
meditate. Knowledge, howsoever valuable, is useless in transforming you.
Only your own experience, your own fire, can transform you. And you have
the fire, everybody is born with it. You just have to turn yourself
inwards.</p><p><br></p><p>I hope that Basui may have turned inwards by now. If not then he will
have to come here. Because now, even in Japan, Zen has become just a
scholarly study. Zen is not a scholarly study. Zen is an existential
quantum leap. It is not of the mind. It is going beyond the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Dogen, a Zen master, wrote:</p><p><br></p><p>SCARECROW IN THE HILLOCK. PADDY FIELD –</p><p>HOW UNAWARE! HOW USEFUL!</p><p><br></p><p>A scarecrow is a false man which farmers make just by putting up a
bamboo and covering the top with a mud pot, as if it is a monk’s head,
perfectly shaven. Then they put another bamboo just like a cross and
cover the cross with a robe, and put two hands on it. It is to create
fear in wild animals.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes in moonlit nights even the scarecrow looks so beautiful,
and certainly it is useful. But it is not a true man. So if a thing is
useful it does not mean it is true, and vice versa: if it is true it
does not mean that it may prove useful. What use is enlightenment? You
cannot sell it. Even if you want to, even if you can find somebody to
purchase it, there is no way of selling it. What use is
enlightenment?</p><p><br></p><p>Utility is not the goal of life. The goal of life is a deep
relaxation from all effort, being in a dance with the dancing trees,
with the dancing stars, rejoicing in existence without any worry,
without any mind, just being part of the cosmos.</p><p><br></p><p>Dogen is right, “Scarecrow in the hillock. Paddy field – how
unaware...”</p><p><br></p><p>The poor fellow is absolutely unaware. But that is the situation of
all of us. We are just scarecrows – hung up on a skeleton and covered
with a skin bag.</p><p>They have invented, and they are already making man-made men, robots.
They will be perfectly good, in fact they will be more efficient than
you. The only problem is when their battery runs out. Otherwise you will
not be able to know... a person is saying to you, “I love you,
sweetheart,” and then rrrrr, rrrr... his battery runs out, and you
suddenly become aware, “My God, it is a robot.” Otherwise he had the
whole program, the whole dialogue, computerized. He can do many things,
he is very useful.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days ago in Japan, in a factory where they were using
robots, an accident happened which may determine the future of robots in
the coming century. Robots can work twenty-four hours at a time. They
don’t need Sundays or any other holiday. They don’t go on strike, they
don’t ask for any raise. They are very good people, nice and
gentlemanly. And they work continuously. One robot can do the work of
almost one thousand people in the same time period. But in a factory
where a few robots were used experimentally, something went wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>It always happens with electricity – something goes wrong. Something
went wrong and six robots just clutched at the nearest human being who
was passing by, and hugged him. It was not in their program, and a robot
hug? – the man was finished.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot survive after a robot hug. You will have so many fractures
that it will not be worth hospitalizing you. They are still trying to
find out what happened. Something went wrong because it was not only
one, but six robots, all of whom were working in the factory. Suddenly a
great love for humanity arose – and they don’t believe in
heterosexuality or homosexuality; it doesn’t matter... Anybody who was
moving around, they simply pulled him close, gave him a good hug and
finished him.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been known to biologists that there are a few spiders in
Africa which are a very rare species, but very significant. When the
male mounts the female, making love – maybe he is talking in their
language all kinds of movie dialogues – when he comes onto her, the lady
underneath starts eating the fellow. That spider makes love only once in
his life, then his work is finished. But he has a great orgasm. He is
trembling on long legs and the lady is eating him and he is in such
ecstasy. He cannot even escape. Each love becomes death.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps it is very symbolic. If robots get mixed up in humanity, they
will have everything that you have. The only thing will be that they
will be running on batteries, so it depends on the battery, how powerful
it is. If a robot makes love to a woman it will depend on his battery.
After it that woman will never be satisfied by any man because human
batteries are very small. There is human electricity in the body but a
very small quantity.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is not just a utility, that can be done by machines, by robots.
Man is a dance, a song, for no purpose at all. Do you think a rose has
any purpose? Do you think a lotus has any purpose? Do you think these
millions of stars have any purpose? Just out of sheer joy the whole
existence is dancing. A man of meditation comes to the same point. He
starts dancing in utter ecstasy and joy without any purpose. This kind
of man may love you, he may have compassion, he may be creative but all
for sheer joy. Only for a buddha is art for art’s sake. For everybody
else art is a commodity to be sold in the marketplace.</p><p><br></p><p>Another Zen poem:</p><p>THE MIND CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA; THE BODY CANNOT BECOME THE
BUDDHA.</p><p>ONLY WHAT CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA CAN BECOME THE BUDDHA.</p><p>What are the ingredients in you? The body cannot become the buddha,
the mind cannot become the buddha. Apart from body and mind is there
something else within you? That is what I am calling watchfulness,
awareness, witnessing. Only that, but that also cannot become the
buddha, it already is the buddha. It is a very beautiful poem and it
shows that the man understands what he is saying.…</p><p><br></p><p>THE MIND CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA; THE BODY CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA.
ONLY WHAT CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA CAN BECOME THE BUDDHA.</p><p>That last part will look like a puzzle to anybody who does not
understand his own awareness. You don’t have to become a buddha. You
already are a buddha, you just have to discover it. You are covered with
a body, you are covered with a mind. You just have to discover yourself,
you don’t have to become. You just have to recognize. You just have to
penetrate within your body and mind, reaching to the innermost core –
and suddenly you are the buddha. It is not that you have become a
buddha, you are a fully-fledged buddha already. You have just not looked
inside yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1</p><p><br></p><p>Anando has asked a question:</p><p><br></p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>LAST NIGHT YOU SAID THAT THE TRANSMISSION CAN HAPPEN IN A SECOND,
THAT YOU REACH OUT TO US EVERY DAY – BUT STILL OUR DOORS ARE CLOSED. SO
MANY OF US HAVE BEEN WITH YOU SO MANY YEARS; YOU HAVE MELTED OUR HEARTS
SO MANY TIMES. CAN IT BE THAT OUR DOORS HAVE SOMEHOW RUSTED SHUT?</p><p><br></p><p>Anando, saying that your doors are closed is only symbolic. You don’t
have any doors. They cannot be rusted shut.</p><p><br></p><p>Have I told you the famous anecdote about Rabiya al-Adabiya?</p><p>She was a Sufi master, very rare because she was a woman, and very
unique, almost like a Bodhidharma. She never went to the mosque and
people used to ask her, “You are so religious, so simple, so innocent.
Why don’t you come to the mosque?”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “What is the purpose now? The mosque is for you because you
are not sincere and you are not simple. It is not for me. I have found
my home.” One day she was passing by the mosque and a man named Hassan,
who afterwards became a great master himself, was praying in front of
the steps with both his hands raised, kneeling down on the ground: “God,
when will you listen to me? Why don’t you open the door?”</p><p><br></p><p>When Rabiya heard it, she hit Hassan and told him, “You idiot, there
are no doors! And to whom are you praying? There is nobody in the sky to
answer your question. Just go home and look inwards – there are no
doors.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing is preventing you except your own desire to remain outside,
maybe to have a little more money, a little more political power, a
little more influence in the world, a little more of a name to be
written in the history books. This is all trivia. Just remember not to
get caught by this trivia. Enter into yourself and the buddha is
there.</p><p><br></p><p>Perfect! There is nothing missing in it. Before we enter again
tonight – because it is a dangerous journey... You may find the buddha
and may not come out, but I take the risk, because I will be responsible
before the court: “You told people to go in and they have gone. Now pull
them out!” It is very difficult. So you have to remember, when I say
come out, come out!</p><p><br></p><p>Going in is very easy. But the inside is so beautiful and so alluring
that you may decide – what is the point of coming out? Please don’t do
that because I will be responsible. So just see the buddha, understand
that he is there, but when Nivedano gives you the drumbeat to come back,
don’t hesitate. Just come back slowly, gracefully, remembering the
buddha. Keep the remembrance around your twenty-four-hour life, in your
actions, in your gestures, in your words, in your silences.</p><p><br></p><p>But please, this one thing you have to remember: don’t get stuck
there inside, because then nobody can pull you out; no operation will
help. If you decide to be in, finished! Then we will just have to make a
ceremony, that one man has become a buddha. We don’t say that anybody
has died because here nobody dies. Up to now only three persons have
become buddhas. Death is a fiction.</p><p><br></p><p>But there is no need and no hurry. Enjoy going in every evening just
like going for an evening walk. Enjoy, relish, be nourished and let this
experience transform your whole outer life. But one never knows what you
will decide when you are inside. You will be alone.</p><p><br></p><p>So before that, a few good laughters, perhaps just those laughters
will bring you out: “Let us have one night more, a few laughters more.
Perhaps our master will tell some jokes tomorrow and I will not be
here.” Remember it!</p><p><br></p><p>Mad Marvin escapes from the crazyhouse and runs to a nearby town. He
is seen standing by an old well, dancing and shouting, “Five! Five!
Five!”</p><p><br></p><p>Curious, Officer Chump, the local cop, saunters over to Marvin.</p><p>“What is all this noise about?” inquires the cop.</p><p><br></p><p>“Look!” exclaims Mad Marvin, pointing into the well. “Look! Five!
Five! Five!”</p><p><br></p><p>Officer Chump shakes his head at the looney, and just to humor him,
steps up to the well. Then, with a wide grin and a big push, Mad Marvin
shouts, “Six! Six! Six!”</p><p><br></p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Be silent, close your eyes. Sit just as a buddha, a frozen statue, no
movement.</p><p><br></p><p>Gather your consciousness inwards. Go deeper and deeper<span class=s4></span>At the very center of your being is</p><p>your enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>This very moment, being at the center in such tremendous silence, you
are a buddha. You don’t have to become a buddha, you just have to
discover. You have only forgotten, you have just to remember.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be afraid, this is your space.</p><p><br></p><p>You will not meet anybody on the way except your own being in all its
glory and splendor, in all its eternity, beauty, truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody is carrying the ultimate treasure within himself. To make
it more clear.…</p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Relax, let the body and the mind remain there. Withdraw your
identification, just be a watcher. Watching is the secret key.</p><p>It opens the doors of all that is mystery, all that is miracle.</p><p><br></p><p>Rejoice in it and remember the path, the way, by which you have come
to this point, so that at any time you want you can enter in and get
refreshed.</p><p>Bring out your buddhahood in your actions, in your gestures, in your
responses.</p><p><br></p><p>Just this small thing of entering into your own center is the whole
religion – everything else follows on its own accord. When things happen
spontaneously, they have a beauty of their own.</p><p><br></p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Come back. Resurrect slowly, keeping your awareness, your
remembrance. Sit down like a buddha for a few seconds.</p><p><br></p><p>This is an ever-deepening process. It is not that one day you become
buddha and the pilgrimage is finished. You go on becoming more and more,
your depth goes on becoming deeper and deeper, your clarity becomes
absolutely dustless.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the greatest phenomenon in the world to experience your
buddhahood and act it in your ordinary life.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Anando?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p><br></p><p>Can we celebrate the gathering of ten thousand buddhas? Yes!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

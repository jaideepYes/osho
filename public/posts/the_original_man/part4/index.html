IF I GO ON AND FREEZE MY EYES, IT WOULD JUST SHOW A FLAW. THE SPECIAL TRANSMISSION IN A SINGLE STATEMENT IS TAKING IN A THIEF WHO RANSACKS YOUR HOUSE. NOT LOSING THE FUNDAMENTAL SOURCE IS LIKE A FOX FOND OF ITS DEN. THEREFORE TRUE THUSNESS, ORDINARY AND HOLY, IS ALL DREAM TALK; BUDDHAS AND SENTIENT BEINGS ARE EXPRESSIONS OF ASSUMPTIONS.\nWHEN YOU GET HERE TURN THE LIGHT AROUND TO SHINE BACK, LET GO YOUR HANDS AND ACCEPT IT – EVEN THEN YOU STILL WILL NOT HAVE ESCAPED BEING LIKE A COLD CICADA CLINGING TO A DEAD TREE, NOT TURNING HIS HEAD WHEN HIS CRYING ENDS.\nDOKAI RAISED HIS STAFF AND CONCLUDED:\nIF YOU CAN GET IT HERE, IT IS ALL SOMETHING SET UP BY THE BUDDHAS. EVEN IF YOU CAN SPRING UP IN THE EAST AND DISAPPEAR IN THE WEST, OPEN OUT OR SHUT AWAY FREELY, YOU STILL HAVEN’T EVEN DREAMED OF SEEING WHAT WAS BEFORE THE BUDDHAS.\nYOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THERE IS ONE MAN WHO DOESN’T GET ANYTHING FROM OTHERS, DOES NOT ACCEPT ANY TEACHING OR COMMAND, AND DOES NOT FALL WITHIN\nTHE SCOPE OF GRADE OR RANK. IF YOU KNOW THIS MAN, YOUR LIFE’S STUDY IS COMPLETED.\nHERE DOKAI PAUSED AND SUDDENLY CALLED OUT TO THE ASSEMBLY, SAYING, “IF YOU FREEZE YOUR EYES ANY MORE, DON’T BOTHER TO SEE ME.”\nAnando, the original man is the constant concern of Zen. In your innermost being no dust has gathered from outside, no thought is capable of reaching there. It is as pure and clean as ever. It never becomes old, it never becomes stale; its freshness is its nature.\nBut it is deep down hidden inside you. Many layers have been put upon it: layers of knowledge, layers of respectability, layers of morality; all kinds of honor, all kinds of belief systems. It has become a very thick wall, although it is only of words. And a courageous and intelligent man can cut the whole wall in the single blow of a sword. Otherwise it takes lives and lives, taking away one layer, then another layer. And while you are taking away layers, new layers are gathering. You have to clean your mirror every day; otherwise in twenty-four hours new dust will have gathered.\nSo enlightenment has to be in a single blow; otherwise it will take an infinity of time. You cannot go slow, you cannot postpone it. You have to take the leap this very moment, because the next is never certain. Roads turn, and friends who are together become enemies. That which was possible this moment may not be possible the next moment.\nThe whole world is a chaos and in a mess. It is not only now that it is in a chaos, it has always been in a chaos, because so many millions of unconscious human beings are creating all kinds of dreams, projections, expectations, frustrations. The whole air is heavy with the clouds of unfulfilled hopes, incomplete desires. Even failures in success: knowing that you have achieved the goal that you had determined, you are still as ignorant and empty, inside, as you were before.\nThey say in a proverb that nothing succeeds like success; it is only a half truth. I want to make it complete: nothing fails like success. And the second part is more important; otherwise kings would not renounce their kingdoms, Gautam Buddha would not have been born. There comes a moment when you are successful moneywise or powerwise, you are famous...\nRousseau has lamented in his autobiography that, “When I was young the only desire in me was to become world famous.” One never thinks what you will do when you become world famous. One simply never asks these questions. One simply gets caught in a net: “Everybody is trying to be successful and famous – I should be the first in the queue.” It is a long struggle and conflict.\nFinally, Rousseau became a world-famous philosopher. But unfortunately in France in those days there was a tradition that if you tear off a piece of cloth from a world-famous man, that piece of cloth brings success to you. This became such a trouble that he could not go even for a morning walk. He would come home naked, with scratches all over, and crowds were preventing him from escaping. He could not go to the railway station; he had to be escorted by the police. And even the police, in the end, would snatch sometimes...\nHe writes in his autobiography, “When I was nobody I suffered, when I became somebody I suffered. Suffering is there, whatever you do.”\nSo one day one comes to know that one layer is finished, but there are other layers. Zen’s insistence that it should be in this moment, not to be postponed, has a very significant implication. It shows that if you cannot do it now, tomorrow is not going to be different, just a little more difficult, because within twenty-four hours more dust will have gathered. The sooner you do it the better.\nAnd the reason for doing it is to find what nature has desired you to be: whether you are a seed of a lotus flower or a seed of something else. These layers don’t allow you even to be acquainted with your potentiality, your seed. Not only do they prevent, they actively take you astray. They create new goals which have nothing to do with your innermost being.\nA great surgeon was celebrating his sixtieth birthday. He had trained hundreds of surgeons during his professorship in the university. They all had gathered and they were drinking and dancing, and then somebody noticed that the old surgeon was not there. So one of his friends went out to see – perhaps he had gone out for some air. He was sitting, crying, underneath a tree.\nThe man said, “Are you insane or something? We have come from faraway places to celebrate your birthday and you are sitting here and weeping.”\nThe surgeon said, “The reason is, I never wanted to be a surgeon. That was not my longing. I wanted to be a dancer, but my parents, my teachers, my colleagues, everybody forced me to be a surgeon, because to be a surgeon is respectable. And who knows? As far as dancing is concerned you may turn out to be just a beggar. Dancing is not a certain profession.”\nAnd the old professor said, “Now I have succeeded as the greatest surgeon in the country, but there is no fulfillment. The tears are because my whole life was wasted unnecessarily. Even if I had been a street dancer, just dancing for any crowd that wanted to see my dance, I would have felt more fulfilled. I would not have felt this discontent. Now there is no way to go back, it is too late.”\nAlways remember, time is running fast – every moment you are becoming older. What is possible today may not be possible tomorrow; hence don’t take unnecessary risks.\nThe discovery of the original man is absolutely essential, because hidden in the original man is your destiny, what nature wanted you to be. Unless you become that you will remain frustrated, you will remain angry. You will not be able to love, you will not be able to dance, you will not be able to relax. Your whole life will become just a sickness until death.\nThe discovery of the original man is the discovery of the eternal element in you. And once you have discovered it and allowed it spontaneously to go anywhere it wants to go – without bothering about your parents, your well-wishers, your teachers, your preachers – you may find that your original being in its ultimate fulfillment, flowering, is the buddha. The buddha is nobody else.\nYou are the seed buddhas. The buddha is the lotus, not the seed. This is not much of a difference, but we make it such a long journey, unnecessarily.\nDOKAI SAID:\nAS SOON AS I GET UP ON THE SEAT TO SPEAK, I AM ALREADY INVOLVED IN THE DUSTS.\nAs far as the inner innocence is concerned, the experience of your original source is concerned, Dokai is making really a great statement. And he has not uttered a single word, he has simply got up on the seat to speak. But just the intention to speak has already raised much dust – just the intention. The words are going to raise much more dust! Hence the emphasis of Zen that words are absolutely impotent in conveying the experience. You can have it as a transmission, as a synchronicity with the master or with the universe.\nThe master is simply a door to the universe. It is easier to get in harmony with the master – he is a living human being. Once you know the art of how to get in harmony, the master’s work is finished. You can get in harmony with the stars and the mountains and the rivers... and the whole universe becomes your home. Now you are as natural as a rose, as a lotus, as a bird flying in the sky.\nExcept man everything is original. Only man has gone astray.\nDon’t take it as unfortunate. Going astray means man has come to a point where he has the freedom to go astray or not to go astray. Other than man, the whole existence is centered, natural but unconscious. It cannot go astray. The rose cannot become something else; it cannot become a marigold. The whole existence, except man, lives naturally, but this naturalness is not out of freedom. Only man has this great destiny: he can choose to be a fake or to be real.\nThe joy that comes to man by being original does not come to the whole of existence, because they are natural, they cannot go beyond that. They are not freely natural, they are automatically natural. Their being natural is a kind of bondage. The rose is bound to be a rose, and the grass is bound to be grass. And the trees, however they may try, cannot reach to the stars.\nEverything is in a universal slavery. That’s why there are no accidents. Millions of stars don’t clash... no traffic control. They are all moving with tremendous speed, but there are no accidents anywhere... no universal ambulance rushing to this star, rushing to that star!\nAnd just in Poona, this dirty, tiny village, utterly polluted – look at the traffic...! It seems all the mad people of India have become rickshaw drivers in Poona! In every direction they are going, and the miracle is, rarely any accident happens. As far as I am concerned, I think it is a miracle that people reach home. No traffic seems to be enjoying so much freedom as Poona traffic.\nNature is in a bondage; it is not even aware that it is in bondage. It is the privilege of man to know that he is in bondage. And when you know that you are in bondage, you also know, simultaneously, that freedom is possible.\nIf you know that you are in prison, you can start finding ways how to get out of it, how to have some contact with the outside world, how to find some way, some ladder, some hole to get out of the prison. But if you think the prison is your home, then naturally there is no question of inquiring.\nMillions of human beings think that whatever they are, this is what they are supposed to be. They are suffering and they are miserable; they are in anguish, they are in absolute angst; their life is a tragedy. But they go on living, saying, “What is the point of committing suicide? Who knows...?” At\nleast while you are alive you are surrounded with the crowd, which is also as miserable as you are. You have friends – you can tell your misery to them and console them, and they can console you in return, and there is something to gossip about!\nCommitting suicide is entering into a dark tunnel where no one knows what is going to happen. At least one thing is certain: you will be alone. There is no guarantee that the misery will not be there; there is no guarantee that your anxiety will not be there. But there is one thing certain, that with all this, one new thing will be added: you will be alone. And there will be darkness and no electricity!\nNo scripture says that there is electricity in hell, or in heaven. You should not expect these things there. Even if you can find fire... perhaps they have fire in hell to torture people. But it is not known whether in heaven they even have fire for cold nights or to put small lights in your houses, or some petrol lighters for your cigarettesIt is certain that in heaven there is no shopping mall – saints\ndon’t need anything!\nBy committing suicide it is not certain that you will reach heaven. Most probably you will simply wander in the darkness and you will not reach anywhere because you don’t have any map and you don’t have any virtue. The only possibility is that by chance you may enter into hell. That too by chance! It is a vast universe. It is not that you just get out of your home and enter into hell; it is not so easy, otherwise most of the people would never return home. There are problems in hell, but nothing compared to the home, “Home Sweet Home” These miserable creatures sing songs, and\nthey think they are befooling others.\nThe experience of enlightenment, or the experience of the original man, is inexpressible, so inexpressible that Dokai says:\nAS SOON AS I GET UP ON THE SEAT TO SPEAK, I AM ALREADY INVOLVED IN THE DUSTS. IF I GO ON AND FREEZE MY EYES, IT WOULD JUST SHOW A FLAW. THE SPECIAL TRANSMISSION IN A SINGLE STATEMENT IS TAKING IN A THIEF WHO RANSACKS YOUR HOUSE.\nA very original statement about the one-blow enlightenment. He says it is like TAKING IN A THIEF WHO RANSACKS YOUR HOUSE.\nI am reminded about Sheik Farid, a great mystic...\nA thief entered his house. He had collected a few things from the neighbors and he thought, “By the way, have a look into this poor monk’s house.”\nAs he entered he found nothing but a begging bowl, a staff – things like that, that are needed even by the poorest man, but he collected all of them. Farid was sleeping, or pretending to sleep, just looking from the corners of his eyes at what was going on. When the thief had bundled everything up, he went out of the house, mixing Farid’s things with the other things that he had stolen from other houses. He made a huge bundle of all those things, and started to carry it.\nAfter a few steps the thief found somebody was following him. He looked and he was surprised. Sheik Farid was well known – “and this fellow was asleepwhy is he following me?” And suddenly\nthe thief asked, “Why are you following me?”\nFarid said, “Why? We are changing houses.”\nThe thief said, “My God, this means I have to take you also to my house?” Farid said, “You are taking everything else!”\nThe thief said, “I have never seen such a strange fellow. Take away your things!” Farid said, “Fifty-fifty.”\nThe thief said, “My God! But these are not your things, they belong to others.” Farid said, “No. Either fifty-fifty or I am coming with you.”\nFifty-fifty he had to agree to – crying, because he had stolen those things at so much risk. “And this fellow, sleeping perfectly well, did not speak a single word; otherwise I would not have touched his things. They are are of no value at all.”\nAnd Farid said, “Of course I am the chooser, so I will choose which things come to my lot and which things go to your lot. I am always a master of any situation.”\nHe said, “That I can see. You just choose quickly, otherwise the neighbors will wake up and everything will be gone. You just take away whatever you want. Don’t bother whether it is exactly fifty-fifty or not.”\nFarid was a very humorous man. He writes in his biography, “That was such a joy to share. In the morning I went around and told people, ‘You can come and take if your things are here. I could not manage one hundred percent, because that would have been very difficult – that man was tough. But still, at least sixty percent I have managed. So take away your things and be careful about thieves. As for me it is okay. What can he take away from me?’”\nDokai is saying that, in a single moment, to find the original man within you, is like taking a thief into your house who steals everything that you have collected around yourself, and leaves you naked as if you are just born. From this just-born nakedness you may for the first time feel a new throb, a new heartbeat, a new source of breathing and a new growth. No longer conditioned by the society or by religion or by education, you will start being yourself according to this vast universe’s desire.\nAnd the difference between you and the trees, and the flowers, and the mountains will be that they are mountains not out of freedom. Roses are roses not out of freedom, but whatever you are, you will be out of your freedom. Originality and freedom – these two qualities combined make you the awakened one, original and with freedom. Naturally, with freedom, nobody is going to choose something against his nature. With freedom one is going choicelessly with the flow of the wind, with the flow of the river, wherever it leads.\nFinding the original source, one finds a tremendous trust in oneself, because one is now connected with the universe. Otherwise we are rootless people, disconnected, just going here and there for no reason, for no purpose – just tourists.\nThe easiest way to waste your time is to be a tourist. That is the worst category of human beings: people who have nothing else to do, who just know how to carry big suitcases and cameras and run from this place to that place. And they are in such a hurry; they don’t see the Taj Mahal, they just take a photograph. At home, at ease, they will look at the picture. They are making an album which they could have purchased in their own city, only more professional, more accurate. All this running away...\nBut that’s what is happening in our actual lives. What are you trying to be? Is it something that the society has told you to be, or is it out of your autonomous freedom? Every child is being asked again and again, “What are you going to be?”\nIn my childhood they used to ask me, “What are you going to be?” I said, “That is not your concern. I am keeping it a secret.”\nThey said, “Strange, we have asked many children. Every child says he is going to be a doctor, he is going to be an advocate, he is going to be a leader, a politician, or he is going to be a sannyasin. You are the only person who is saying, ‘This is not your concern’ – and to whom are you talking?”\nI said, “I know, you are my uncle, you are my father, but that does not mean that my growth is your concern. Just keep yourself out of my way. I know where I am going!”\nThey said, “Remember, you will end up as nothing!” I said, “I know.”\nAnd by chance I ended up as nothing. But I am so happy in my nothingness, because it is my whole freedom. Nobody has imposed it on me, it is my own choice. I have not allowed anybody even to touch it. This has been my constant stand, from my early childhood up to university.\nThe question was asked many times, “What are you going to be?” And when they heard that “This is not your concern. You should take care of yourself, I will take care of myself. Just don’t collide with me,” my professors were hurt. They said, “We were asking out of sympathy.”\nI said, “I don’t want anybody’s sympathy. Never mention that dirty word!” They said, “My God, ‘sympathy’, you call a dirty word?”\nI said, “It is, because it is a substitute and all substitutes are prostitutes.” They said, “Strange, from where do you get these ideas?”\nI said, “I don’t get them from anywhere. Can’t I make them up myself? I don’t have to quote anybody, I quote myself.”\nEverybody is trying to be somebody else, because the whole pressure of society is to be somebody else. Nobody even takes note of what your original program is, what the program you brought with you at your birth is.\nIn a natural, peaceful, intelligent society this will be our first task: to help every child to find out his program, not our program. And even if his program goes against our program, it is out of love that we should support him. We may not agree with him, but we should support him. He has to follow his nature.\nZen is so insistent on the original man – not without reason, because everybody has become a carbon copy of somebody else. This has become almost a rule of the game. Zen is a rebellion: a rebellion against the whole society’s past, a rebellion for the individual and his freedom to choose his own destiny. It is not an ordinary revolution – a communist revolution, a fascist revolution, a Gandhian revolution; these are just mundane revolutions.\nZen is the deepest revolution within the individual himself. It has nothing to do with the outside structure. And just to be oneself is the greatest blessing and the greatest ecstasy.\nNOT LOSING THE FUNDAMENTAL SOURCE IS LIKE A FOX FOND OF ITS DEN...\nDon’t lose the fundamental source of your life.\nTHEREFORE TRUE THUSNESS, ORDINARY AND HOLY, IS ALL DREAM TALK; BUDDHAS AND SENTIENT BEINGS ARE EXPRESSIONS OF ASSUMPTIONS...\nOnly a great master can say such things. What is he saying? He is saying that somebody is trying to be a buddha, somebody is trying to find the original source – these are all mental assumptions. Even the buddha is a concept.\nYou will have to drop the buddha. You will have to drop all your assumptions and just look at the very center of your being, where there is no assumption, where you are drowned into your original source. Get rooted there, and then branches will shoot on their own accord and flowers will come in their own time. You need not worry. Your only worry should be that you are not distracted from your original source, that you are not bribed from your original source, that you stick to one point: “I am going to be myself, neither Gautam Buddha nor Jesus Christ...”\nSometimes I think it is good that they crucified Jesus, because that fellow was pretending to be the son of God. That is absolute fantasy, and we should not allow these kinds of people, otherwise somebody will say, “I am the father of God.”\nIf Jesus is the son, somebody must be the father. And what about uncles and aunts and the whole family? And you cannot prevent... if you accept Jesus as the son, without any certificate, without any indication from God himself, what is the problem in saying, “I am the grandfather of Jesus?”\nThese are all assumptions. One should be just oneself. The moment somebody tries to pretend to be somebody else, crucify him because he is spreading a sickness in the society. He is going to pollute the minds of people: “You have to be somebody special. You have to be a prophet, a messenger, a messiah; otherwise you are just ordinary.”\nNobody wants to be ordinary. Even those you think are ordinary, in their minds they think they are extraordinary. They smile without showing you that “you are an idiot, I am extraordinary. You can\ngo on thinking that because you have a little more riches or a little more political power... but that does not matter. The real thing is, I am so extraordinary. I don’t care about riches or about political power.”\nDokai is saying: NOT LOSING THE FUNDAMENTAL SOURCE IS LIKE A FOX FOND OF ITS\nDEN... Cling to your source. At any cost you have to remain being yourself. You may end up just like me, into nothingness. I can only share my experience, that being nothing is the greatest joy. But I don’t want you to become nothing, I don’t want you to imitate! Remember the difference.\nI am saying, being yourself, the worst that can happen to you is that you may end up into nothing. That happened to me, and I am feeling so blissful that I cannot stop spreading the fire around, making people courageous enough to explore their original source – even if they end up into nothing.\nNOT LOSING THE FUNDAMENTAL SOURCE IS LIKE A FOX FOND OF ITS DEN. THEREFORE TRUE THUSNESS, ORDINARY AND HOLY, IS ALL DREAM TALK; BUDDHAS AND SENTIENT BEINGS ARE EXPRESSIONS OF ASSUMPTIONS.\nHow do you know that a man is a buddha? Because he has said it to you, but this is very gullible. How do you know that Jesus Christ is the son of God? In the first place nobody knows about God, and suddenly, this carpenter’s son – not actually the son of the carpenter, but of somebody else who pretended to be the holy ghost...\nHe is talking about being the son of God, and the only son – and people are trying to be like Jesus. One great classic of Christianity is THE IMITATION OF CHRIST. How to imitate so that you can also become Jesus.\nI used to see the principal of a Christian theological college on the way to the university, and we became friends. While coming and going I was always stopping at his house for a little talk – certainly a great theological talk. I would create some trouble in his mind for the whole twenty-four hours until I saw him again.\nFinally, he said, “This stopping every day is very dangerous, because it has taken away my peace of mind. You ask such questions!”\nI had asked him: “I am reading THE IMITATION OF CHRIST, but the ultimate should be the crucifixion; otherwise you are just a half-baked potato. So what do you think about this great classic? At what point do you stop following Christ? If you are really following him you will have to bribe a few people to crucify you, because nowadays nobody is interested in crucifying anybody. People have their work, their concerns – who is interested?”\nHe said, “The whole night I could not sleep. I had always thought that THE IMITATION OF CHRIST is a great book and you disturbed my whole idea. Even in my dream I dreamed that somebody was crucifying me.”\nHe said, “My God, this is enough! I don’t want to discuss theology with you because you create such strange theological questions which are never discussed by great theologians. For example, this grandfather... it is absolutely rational; otherwise the whole thing seems to be so phony. God has\nno father; the son is a bastard; nobody knows who this Holy Ghost is – some gangster? What kind of theology is this?”\nDon’t be distracted either by Buddha or Jesus or Mahavira. Don’t be distracted by anybody, including me. You have to be just yourself, purely yourself. Only then can you attain to the ultimate bliss possible to man.\nOnly then can you blossom into many flowers, and your life can be a life of fulfillment, contentment, peace, without any tension at all.\nThe enlightened man is the original man come to his ultimate growth, not imitating anybody but just insisting on being himself. The whole society is trying to drag you somewhere else.\nWHEN YOU GET HERE, TURN THE LIGHT AROUND TO SHINE BACK, LET GO YOUR HANDS AND ACCEPT IT – EVEN THEN YOU STILL WILL NOT HAVE ESCAPED BEING LIKE A COLD CICADA CLINGING TO A DEAD TREE, NOT TURNING HIS HEAD WHEN HIS CRYING ENDS.\nDOKAI RAISED HIS STAFF AND CONCLUDED:\nIF YOU CAN GET IT HERE, IT IS ALL SOMETHING SET UP BY THE BUDDHAS. EVEN IF YOU CAN SPRING UP IN THE EAST AND DISAPPEAR IN THE WEST, OPEN OUT OR SHUT AWAY FREELY, YOU STILL HAVEN’T EVEN DREAMED OF SEEING WHAT WAS BEFORE THE BUDDHAS.\nYou can think of East and West, you can turn this way and that way, but you are in the mind – you are not going out of the mind. You can think, I am a buddha. There are religions which repeat it as mantra: I am a buddha, I am a buddha. And if you repeat it many times continuously, you may start thinking you are.\nThe Hindus go on thinking, aham brahmasmi, I am the ultimate – and repeating it again and again and again. Naturally, the memory goes on deeper and deeper and you may even, at the risk of your life, repeat aham brahmasmi. That does not prove that you have reached the ultimate. Al- Hillaj Mansoor was also crucified because he was saying “Ana’l haq!” – I am God and I have sent Mohammed as a prophet. Now, Mohammedans cannot accept even for a single moment somebody calling himself God and reducing Mohammed to just a prophet.\nMansoor’s experience that “I am God” may have been just a mind trip. That’s what his master Junnaid was telling him continuously, “Okay, you are God, but what is the need of proclaiming it? Just keep quiet. Yes, you are God but don’t say it to anybody.”\nMansoor said, “But when I AM God, why should I not say it?”\nIt was a beautiful dialogue between the master and the disciple. Junnaid said, “In that case I am also God. And you know perfectly well there are not two Gods.”\nHe said, “That’s right. There is only one God.”\nAnd how to deny the master – his own master? He says, “I am also God, but I don’t say it to anybody because I don’t want to be unnecessarily crucified. What is the point in it?”\nIt is a suicidal instinct according to Junnaid, and I think he is right – that it is very psychological. But Mansoor did not listen to him – and he was a very beautiful man. But the experience should not be expressed by the word ‘God’, because that word is contaminated. That word has become an obsession for millions of people of different religions. It is better to avoid it.\nHe could have said, “I am pure consciousness,” and nobody would have bothered about it. Who bothers about pure consciousness? If you are pure consciousness, be! Nobody objects. If you say, “I am the original man,” perfectly good! All those things are synonymous.\nZen chooses the most simple and most humanitarian words: the original man. It contains all the buddhas and it contains all the gods, because it contains the essence of the very existence.\nYOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THERE IS ONE MAN... This is the man I have been talking about.\nYOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THERE IS ONE MAN WHO DOES NOT GET ANYTHING FROM OTHERS, DOES NOT ACCEPT ANY TEACHING OR COMMAND, AND DOES NOT FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF GRADE OR RANK. IF YOU KNOW THIS MAN, YOUR LIFE’S STUDY IS COMPLETED. HERE DOKAI PAUSED AND SUDDENLY CALLED OUT TO THE ASSEMBLY SAYING, “IF YOU FREEZE YOUR EYES ANY MORE, DON’T BOTHER TO SEE ME.”\nHe is saying that if you still go on reading the scriptures and freezing your eyes, or meditating and freezing your eyes, don’t come to me again. Come to me again when you have found your original man. I have described the man. I have given the indications and the qualifications of the man.\nIkkyu wrote:\nTHE MIND OF MAN IS WITHOUT SOUND, WITHOUT ODOR.\nHE WHO ANSWERS WHEN CALLED IS NOTHING BUT A THIEF.\nHe is saying that when you are so silent that there is no sound, no odor, and somebody asks you, “Who are you?” only silence is the answer. If you answer anything else – that I am the God, that I am the only begotten son of God, that I am a messiah, that I am a buddha – then you are nothing but a thief. You have borrowed these words from others, from scriptures, but you have not known your original man.\nAnother poet wrote:\nIN THE LANDSCAPE OF SPRING\nTHERE IS NEITHER HIGH NOR LOW;\nTHE FLOWERING BRANCHES GROW NATURALLY, SOME LONG, SOME SHORT.\nThe poet is saying that in nature there is no gradation, no inferiority, no superiority.\nThose who are short don’t feel inferior, those who grow long don’t feel superior. Everything is accepted in its suchness. The original man, once found, and you will not think in terms of gradations; you will not think in terms of who is superior and who is inferior.\nI was staying in a government guest house and two old men came to see me.…\nBoth must have been eighty or eighty-five, and they told me, “We have been friends from our childhood, but we have been in a constant quarrel about the existence of God.” One was an atheist – he did not believe in God. The other was a theist – he believed in God. They said, “We heard you are here, so we thought it will be good to get another opinion about it.”\nI asked those old fellows, “Have you seen God?” – first to the man who believed in God. He said, “No, I have not seen him. I believe, I don’t know.”\nI asked the second man, “Have you seen that there is no God?” He said, “No, I have not seen. But I believe that there is no God.” I said, “There is no disagreement between you two.”\nThey said, “What?”\nI said, “You both believe. On the point of seeing you both agree that you have not seen. Where is the disagreement?”\nThey looked at each other. They said, “The point is worth considering, because neither I know nor you know, and we have been quarreling for our whole lives.”\nI said, “Better discover, rather than believe. In believing you have wasted your whole life.”\nDiscovery is possible in a single moment, but first you will have to drop your beliefs. Disbeliefs are also beliefs, they are just negative beliefs. There is no difference between theists and atheists. Both are believers – one positively, one negatively. The seeker has to be completely free from belief and disbelief. He has to be completely open and available.\nThe original man is not far away on any star – he is hidden within you. Question 1\nAnando has asked:\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\nDOKAI SAYS IT IS ALL DREAM TALK. ARE YOUR WORDS THEN JUST AN EXCUSE TO LULL US INTO A SPACE WHERE HOPEFULLY, SOME DAY, WE MAY BE READY FOR THE SPECIAL TRANSMISSION?\nYou are ready for the special transmission right now, Anando. It just needs courage to accept it.\nThe society has condemned you so deeply, the condemnation has gone so deep in you that you never think you are worthy of anything. And to be “worthy” of being the original man is not a question of worth, it is not a question of deserving.\nYou are.\nEven if you deny it, still you are.\nEven if you try to escape somewhere else, it will be within you.\nSo, Anando, Dokai is right when he says all is talk. You just stop talking, stop thinking – and the original man is there. All that is needed is to give a little gap and you will find a fresh growth, a flame, arising from your very center. That’s what we are trying to do.\nFirst, I am trying to convince you that I am not a scripture, I am a living human being as you are. I am not superior, I don’t have any relationship with God – I am not even a faraway cousin! I am simply just as you are. The difference is so small, it is not even worth mentioning: I know it, and you are looking here and there, not looking at the right point.\nOn the contrary, you are avoiding it, because if you find it there may be troubles. Do you want to be crucified? Do you want to be poisoned? Do you want to be killed? It is better just to be a doctor, a grocer, a film actress, a hairdresser, and not to bother about this original man. These original men have always gotten into trouble – it is better to avoid.\nThe whole history of man is wrong because it has always crushed the original. It wants carbon copies, it wants slaves; it does not want independent people.\nIndependent people will always be rebellious, rebellious in the sense that they will do something only if it fits with their nature. They will not do anything that goes against their nature. The society wants slaves, the society wants obedience.\nThat’s how the Bible starts the story of the world. Adam and Eve are thrown out of the garden of God because they disobeyed. Disobedience is the greatest sin, because disobedience means you are going to be a rebellious person. You will do things which you like. You will not be enslaved by vested interests. Otherwise no problem is there preventing you from asserting your original nature. This very moment you can say, “I am my original nature,” and you can drop all the faces, masks, personalities. You will just be simple.\nPeople are so unbelievably stupid. In the Middle Ages in England, even dogs had clothes, because to see a naked dog is pornography. Strange, what about the horses and the donkeys and the elephants? How are you going to put clothes on all these people? The whole of humanity will be involved in dry cleaning continuously. There will be no other business. Even the legs of chairs and tables were covered because ‘legs’... the word reminds you of something. But in fact the covered legs remind you more. Uncovered they are just wooden legs, but covered, one never knows...!\nPeople have been hiding nature in every possible way: trying to pretend, in the name of etiquette; smiling when you really want to hit, holding back your tears when you want to cry, because a man should not cry; it is only for the weaker sex, for women, to cry to their hearts’ content – and they do. That’s why they are less sick, live longer, are healthier in every way than men, more joyous... and they have a sense of humor.\nMan is such a dodo. But he has been made a dodo. All his reality has been covered. He has to behave like a gentleman.\nOtherwise, Anando, there is no problem at all. I am talking to you to destroy the conditionings, and I am helping you to enter into meditation so that you can find your original self. I don’t give you any ideals. I don’t want you to be somebody other than yourself. And if you are taking time, I am not responsible for it. I am reaching you every day, but I find your doors are closed. The moment your doors are open, the transmission will happen immediately.\nThe transmission is a simple phenomenon. It is just waking you up, but you are sleeping with closed doors. I cannot even enter in your room. Sleep with open doors, don’t be afraid. If I don’t enter, somebody will enter and wake you up. The whole question is of waking you up.\nEvery day we are meditating, you reach very close to the center, but the conditionings are millions of years old. You go with hesitation. I go on forcing you: “A little more, a little more.”\nPoor Nivedano has to go on beating his drum, and the drum is becoming enlightened, not Nivedano. Nivedano is Nivedano, he will always beat the drum. And when he sees that you are not getting the point, he beats more, but he is completely unaware that he has also to become enlightened. I am leaving him for the time being. When you all have become enlightened, then you can all beat Nivedano. And in a single moment he will jump up, and he will say, “I am enlightened. No need to beat me!”\nI trust him – that’s why I am not putting him into meditation. But he is earning great virtue by trying to beat the drum, and he is enjoying.\nAnando, it is just a question of dropping all conditioning. You can do it retail or you can do it wholesale. I would prefer that you do it wholesale because retail is a long process. This day is as good as any day. This moment is as good as any moment. But I will go on trying, inch by inch, that you go in; little by little, that you gather courage.\nI am not going to leave you unless you jump into your original source. You can delay, but you cannot stop. Before Nivedano tries to drum your heads... He is not beating his drum, remember, that is just an excuse. He is beating your heads. Before getting into that serious work of finding the original man, a few laughs will make you ready.\nLeroy, a huge black guy, walks into a bar with a parrot on his shoulder. “Hey!” says the bartender, “Where did you get that?”\n“Africa,” replies the parrot.\nKowalski’s son, Kowalski Junior, comes back from college and asks his dad a riddle: “What is long and hard and leaks?”\n“Son!” exclaims Kowalski, “I can’t believe you would use such vulgar expressions.” “Don’t get excited, Dad,” says the boy. “It is a pen.”\nKowalski is very amused by this trick, and he decides to repeat it at his next church gathering.\n“My son told me this riddle which he heard at college,” brags Kowalski, proudly. “What is long and hard and leaks?”\nThere is a gasp from his listeners and the ladies all raise their hands to their mouths in horror. “Don’t get excited, ladies,” says Kowalski. “It is a pen, not a prick!”\nOld man Finkelstein, the shopkeeper, is waiting at the entrance to the Pearly Gates while Saint Peter speaks to Leroy, a big black guy, who has also just died.\n“You can have anything you want,” says Saint Peter. “I’d like a million dollars,” says Leroy.\n“Done!” says Peter, and Leroy walks away with a suitcase stuffed with dollar bills.\nThen St. Peter turns to Finkelstein and says, “You’ll be granted any wish you make. What would you like?”\n“Well,” says the Fink, “I’d like twenty dollars worth of fake jewelry, and about ten minutes with that black guy!”\nMildred Maxwell is surrounded by all of her sad friends as they look down into her husband, Melvin’s grave.\n“I’m so sorry,” says Mildred’s priest, Father Flab. “What did he die of?” “Gonorrhea,” replies Mildred, sadly.\nThen her neighbor, Peaches, comes up and says, “Oh Mildred, I’m so sorry this happened. What did the poor man die of?”\n“He died of gonorrhea,” says Mildred somberly.\nOld Mrs. Hucksteen comes to give her condolences.\n“The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away,” says the old lady. “And now he has taken Melvin. What was it dear, a heart attack?”\n“No,” says Mildred quietly, “gonorrhea.”\nMildred’s sister Mabel finally comes up to her. “Mildred!” whispers Mabel tensely, “What are you telling people? Melvin did not die of gonorrhea, he died of diarrhea!”\n“I know,” says Mildred. “But I would rather people think he went out like a playboy, and not like the shit he was!”\nNow, Nivedano... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)\nBe silent, close your eyes.\nFeel your body to be completely frozen, no movement.\nGather your consciousness inside, and just like an arrow, let this consciousness go deeper and deeper until it hits the source of your being.\nThere is no fear because on this road to your self you are not going to meet anybody. Deeper and deeper.\nThis moment you are the original man. This moment you are the buddha.\nRemember it, twenty-four hours – not like a parrot.\nLet it become your breathing, your heartbeat, your blood circulation, so that in every action and gesture this originality, this spontaneity is expressed without any effort.\nMeditation is the greatest revolution in the world because it brings the original man into existence. It is always there but every society pushes it under many, many covers. Our work here is to throw all those covers, all those layers and find the real, the original, the natural.\nStart your growth from your natural center. Then whatever you may be, you will find contentment, you will find great joy in life. You will find not only joy in life, but in death too, because your original nature is eternal.\nBirth is a drama, life is a drama, death is a drama. Only your original consciousness is the watcher. Dramas change, the watcher remains.\nNivedano... (Drumbeat)\nRelax, let go. The body is lying there – you just be a watcher of body and mind both, simply a watcher. This watcher is the original man.\nRejoice that you have found it. Feel silently grateful that you have found it. Now don’t forget the root.\nEvery day go on pushing deeper and deeper, because the original man has a circumference and also a center. First you will touch the circumference, and then your arrow will enter into the center.\nOnce you have entered into the center, you have gone beyond life and death. You have become one with the universe.\nNivedano, make your drum enlightened again! (Drumbeat)\nCome back, slowly, so that you can carry the experience with you. Silently, gracefully, sit down as a buddha, without any hesitation, without any doubt.\nYou are the buddha, the awakened soul.\nAt least for this moment you are blessed with the ultimate ecstasy, and all the invisible flowers are showering over you.\nFeel grateful.\nThere is nothing more religious than gratefulness. There is no other prayer than gratefulness.\nIt is a Thank You to existence. Okay, Anando?\nYes, Beloved Master.\nCan we celebrate the gathering of the ten thousand buddhas? Yes!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7914","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_original_man/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_original_man/>The Original Man</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">4 The inner innocence</h1><div class=post-meta>38 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7914 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Original_Man/part4.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

THE DUSTS. IF I GO ON AND FREEZE MY EYES, IT WOULD JUST SHOW A FLAW. THE
SPECIAL TRANSMISSION IN A SINGLE STATEMENT IS TAKING IN A THIEF WHO
RANSACKS YOUR HOUSE. NOT LOSING THE FUNDAMENTAL SOURCE IS LIKE A FOX
FOND OF ITS DEN. THEREFORE TRUE THUSNESS, ORDINARY AND HOLY, IS ALL
DREAM TALK; BUDDHAS AND SENTIENT BEINGS ARE EXPRESSIONS OF
ASSUMPTIONS.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN YOU GET HERE TURN THE LIGHT AROUND TO SHINE BACK, LET GO YOUR
HANDS AND ACCEPT IT – EVEN THEN YOU STILL WILL NOT HAVE ESCAPED BEING
LIKE A COLD CICADA CLINGING TO A DEAD TREE, NOT TURNING HIS HEAD WHEN
HIS CRYING ENDS.</p><p><br></p><p>DOKAI RAISED HIS STAFF AND CONCLUDED:</p><p><br></p><p>IF YOU CAN GET IT HERE, IT IS ALL SOMETHING SET UP BY THE BUDDHAS.
EVEN IF YOU CAN SPRING UP IN THE EAST AND DISAPPEAR IN THE WEST, OPEN
OUT OR SHUT AWAY FREELY, YOU STILL HAVEN’T EVEN DREAMED OF SEEING WHAT
WAS BEFORE THE BUDDHAS.</p><p><br></p><p>YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THERE IS ONE MAN WHO DOESN’T GET ANYTHING FROM
OTHERS, DOES NOT ACCEPT ANY TEACHING OR COMMAND, AND DOES NOT FALL
WITHIN</p><p>THE SCOPE OF GRADE OR RANK. IF YOU KNOW THIS MAN, YOUR LIFE’S STUDY
IS COMPLETED.</p><p><br></p><p>HERE DOKAI PAUSED AND SUDDENLY CALLED OUT TO THE ASSEMBLY, SAYING,
“IF YOU FREEZE YOUR EYES ANY MORE, DON’T BOTHER TO SEE ME.”</p><p><br></p><p>Anando, the original man is the constant concern of Zen. In your
innermost being no dust has gathered from outside, no thought is capable
of reaching there. It is as pure and clean as ever. It never becomes
old, it never becomes stale; its freshness is its nature.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is deep down hidden inside you. Many layers have been put upon
it: layers of knowledge, layers of respectability, layers of morality;
all kinds of honor, all kinds of belief systems. It has become a very
thick wall, although it is only of words. And a courageous and
intelligent man can cut the whole wall in the single blow of a sword.
Otherwise it takes lives and lives, taking away one layer, then another
layer. And while you are taking away layers, new layers are gathering.
You have to clean your mirror every day; otherwise in twenty-four hours
new dust will have gathered.</p><p><br></p><p>So enlightenment has to be in a single blow; otherwise it will take
an infinity of time. You cannot go slow, you cannot postpone it. You
have to take the leap this very moment, because the next is never
certain. Roads turn, and friends who are together become enemies. That
which was possible this moment may not be possible the next moment.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole world is a chaos and in a mess. It is not only now that it
is in a chaos, it has always been in a chaos, because so many millions
of unconscious human beings are creating all kinds of dreams,
projections, expectations, frustrations. The whole air is heavy with the
clouds of unfulfilled hopes, incomplete desires. Even failures in
success: knowing that you have achieved the goal that you had
determined, you are still as ignorant and empty, inside, as you were
before.</p><p><br></p><p>They say in a proverb that nothing succeeds like success; it is only
a half truth. I want to make it complete: nothing fails like success.
And the second part is more important; otherwise kings would not
renounce their kingdoms, Gautam Buddha would not have been born. There
comes a moment when you are successful moneywise or powerwise, you are
famous...</p><p><br></p><p>Rousseau has lamented in his autobiography that, “When I was young
the only desire in me was to become world famous.” One never thinks what
you will do when you become world famous. One simply never asks these
questions. One simply gets caught in a net: “Everybody is trying to be
successful and famous – I should be the first in the queue.” It is a
long struggle and conflict.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, Rousseau became a world-famous philosopher. But
unfortunately in France in those days there was a tradition that if you
tear off a piece of cloth from a world-famous man, that piece of cloth
brings success to you. This became such a trouble that he could not go
even for a morning walk. He would come home naked, with scratches all
over, and crowds were preventing him from escaping. He could not go to
the railway station; he had to be escorted by the police. And even the
police, in the end, would snatch sometimes...</p><p><br></p><p>He writes in his autobiography, “When I was nobody I suffered, when I
became somebody I suffered. Suffering is there, whatever you do.”</p><p>So one day one comes to know that one layer is finished, but there
are other layers. Zen’s insistence that it should be in this moment, not
to be postponed, has a very significant implication. It shows that if
you cannot do it now, tomorrow is not going to be different, just a
little more difficult, because within twenty-four hours more dust will
have gathered. The sooner you do it the better.</p><p><br></p><p>And the reason for doing it is to find what nature has desired you to
be: whether you are a seed of a lotus flower or a seed of something
else. These layers don’t allow you even to be acquainted with your
potentiality, your seed. Not only do they prevent, they actively take
you astray. They create new goals which have nothing to do with your
innermost being.</p><p><br></p><p>A great surgeon was celebrating his sixtieth birthday. He had trained
hundreds of surgeons during his professorship in the university. They
all had gathered and they were drinking and dancing, and then somebody
noticed that the old surgeon was not there. So one of his friends went
out to see – perhaps he had gone out for some air. He was sitting,
crying, underneath a tree.</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “Are you insane or something? We have come from faraway
places to celebrate your birthday and you are sitting here and
weeping.”</p><p><br></p><p>The surgeon said, “The reason is, I never wanted to be a surgeon.
That was not my longing. I wanted to be a dancer, but my parents, my
teachers, my colleagues, everybody forced me to be a surgeon, because to
be a surgeon is respectable. And who knows? As far as dancing is
concerned you may turn out to be just a beggar. Dancing is not a certain
profession.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the old professor said, “Now I have succeeded as the greatest
surgeon in the country, but there is no fulfillment. The tears are
because my whole life was wasted unnecessarily. Even if I had been a
street dancer, just dancing for any crowd that wanted to see my dance, I
would have felt more fulfilled. I would not have felt this discontent.
Now there is no way to go back, it is too late.”</p><p><br></p><p>Always remember, time is running fast – every moment you are becoming
older. What is possible today may not be possible tomorrow; hence don’t
take unnecessary risks.</p><p><br></p><p>The discovery of the original man is absolutely essential, because
hidden in the original man is your destiny, what nature wanted you to
be. Unless you become that you will remain frustrated, you will remain
angry. You will not be able to love, you will not be able to dance, you
will not be able to relax. Your whole life will become just a sickness
until death.</p><p><br></p><p>The discovery of the original man is the discovery of the eternal
element in you. And once you have discovered it and allowed it
spontaneously to go anywhere it wants to go – without bothering about
your parents, your well-wishers, your teachers, your preachers – you may
find that your original being in its ultimate fulfillment, flowering, is
the buddha. The buddha is nobody else.</p><p><br></p><p>You are the seed buddhas. The buddha is the lotus, not the seed. This
is not much of a difference, but we make it such a long journey,
unnecessarily.</p><p><br></p><p>DOKAI SAID:</p><p><br></p><p>AS SOON AS I GET UP ON THE SEAT TO SPEAK, I AM ALREADY INVOLVED IN
THE DUSTS.</p><p>As far as the inner innocence is concerned, the experience of your
original source is concerned, Dokai is making really a great statement.
And he has not uttered a single word, he has simply got up on the seat
to speak. But just the intention to speak has already raised much dust –
just the intention. The words are going to raise much more dust! Hence
the emphasis of Zen that words are absolutely impotent in conveying the
experience. You can have it as a transmission, as a synchronicity with
the master or with the universe.</p><p><br></p><p>The master is simply a door to the universe. It is easier to get in
harmony with the master – he is a living human being. Once you know the
art of how to get in harmony, the master’s work is finished. You can get
in harmony with the stars and the mountains and the rivers... and the
whole universe becomes your home. Now you are as natural as a rose, as a
lotus, as a bird flying in the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>Except man everything is original. Only man has gone astray.</p><p>Don’t take it as unfortunate. Going astray means man has come to a
point where he has the freedom to go astray or not to go astray. Other
than man, the whole existence is centered, natural but unconscious. It
cannot go astray. The rose cannot become something else; it cannot
become a marigold. The whole existence, except man, lives naturally, but
this naturalness is not out of freedom. Only man has this great destiny:
he can choose to be a fake or to be real.</p><p><br></p><p>The joy that comes to man by being original does not come to the
whole of existence, because they are natural, they cannot go beyond
that. They are not freely natural, they are automatically natural. Their
being natural is a kind of bondage. The rose is bound to be a rose, and
the grass is bound to be grass. And the trees, however they may try,
cannot reach to the stars.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything is in a universal slavery. That’s why there are no
accidents. Millions of stars don’t clash... no traffic control. They are
all moving with tremendous speed, but there are no accidents anywhere...
no universal ambulance rushing to this star, rushing to that star!</p><p><br></p><p>And just in Poona, this dirty, tiny village, utterly polluted – look
at the traffic...! It seems all the mad people of India have become
rickshaw drivers in Poona! In every direction they are going, and the
miracle is, rarely any accident happens. As far as I am concerned, I
think it is a miracle that people reach home. No traffic seems to be
enjoying so much freedom as Poona traffic.</p><p><br></p><p>Nature is in a bondage; it is not even aware that it is in bondage.
It is the privilege of man to know that he is in bondage. And when you
know that you are in bondage, you also know, simultaneously, that
freedom is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>If you know that you are in prison, you can start finding ways how to
get out of it, how to have some contact with the outside world, how to
find some way, some ladder, some hole to get out of the prison. But if
you think the prison is your home, then naturally there is no question
of inquiring.</p><p><br></p><p>Millions of human beings think that whatever they are, this is what
they are supposed to be. They are suffering and they are miserable; they
are in anguish, they are in absolute angst; their life is a tragedy. But
they go on living, saying, “What is the point of committing suicide? Who
knows...?” At</p><p>least while you are alive you are surrounded with the crowd, which is
also as miserable as you are. You have friends – you can tell your
misery to them and console them, and they can console you in return, and
there is something to gossip about!</p><p><br></p><p>Committing suicide is entering into a dark tunnel where no one knows
what is going to happen. At least one thing is certain: you will be
alone. There is no guarantee that the misery will not be there; there is
no guarantee that your anxiety will not be there. But there is one thing
certain, that with all this, one new thing will be added: you will be
alone. And there will be darkness and no electricity!</p><p><br></p><p>No scripture says that there is electricity in hell, or in heaven.
You should not expect these things there. Even if you can find fire...
perhaps they have fire in hell to torture people. But it is not known
whether in heaven they even have fire for cold nights or to put small
lights in your houses, or some petrol lighters for your cigarettes<span class=s4></span>It is certain that in heaven there is no shopping mall
– saints</p><p>don’t need anything!</p><p><br></p><p>By committing suicide it is not certain that you will reach heaven.
Most probably you will simply wander in the darkness and you will not
reach anywhere because you don’t have any map and you don’t have any
virtue. The only possibility is that by chance you may enter into hell.
That too by chance! It is a vast universe. It is not that you just get
out of your home and enter into hell; it is not so easy, otherwise most
of the people would never return home. There are problems in hell, but
nothing compared to the home, “Home Sweet Home<span class=s4></span>”
These miserable creatures sing songs, and</p><p>they think they are befooling others.</p><p><br></p><p>The experience of enlightenment, or the experience of the original
man, is inexpressible, so inexpressible that Dokai says:</p><p><br></p><p>AS SOON AS I GET UP ON THE SEAT TO SPEAK, I AM ALREADY INVOLVED IN
THE DUSTS. IF I GO ON AND FREEZE MY EYES, IT WOULD JUST SHOW A FLAW. THE
SPECIAL TRANSMISSION IN A SINGLE STATEMENT IS TAKING IN A THIEF WHO
RANSACKS YOUR HOUSE.</p><p><br></p><p>A very original statement about the one-blow enlightenment. He says
it is like TAKING IN A THIEF WHO RANSACKS YOUR HOUSE.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded about Sheik Farid, a great mystic...</p><p><br></p><p>A thief entered his house. He had collected a few things from the
neighbors and he thought, “By the way, have a look into this poor monk’s
house.”</p><p><br></p><p>As he entered he found nothing but a begging bowl, a staff – things
like that, that are needed even by the poorest man, but he collected all
of them. Farid was sleeping, or pretending to sleep, just looking from
the corners of his eyes at what was going on. When the thief had bundled
everything up, he went out of the house, mixing Farid’s things with the
other things that he had stolen from other houses. He made a huge bundle
of all those things, and started to carry it.</p><p><br></p><p>After a few steps the thief found somebody was following him. He
looked and he was surprised. Sheik Farid was well known – “and this
fellow was asleep<span class=s4></span>why is he following me?” And
suddenly</p><p>the thief asked, “Why are you following me?”</p><p>Farid said, “Why? We are changing houses.”</p><p><br></p><p>The thief said, “My God, this means I have to take you also to my
house?” Farid said, “You are taking everything else!”</p><p>The thief said, “I have never seen such a strange fellow. Take away
your things!” Farid said, “Fifty-fifty.”</p><p>The thief said, “My God! But these are not your things, they belong
to others.” Farid said, “No. Either fifty-fifty or I am coming with
you.”</p><p>Fifty-fifty he had to agree to – crying, because he had stolen those
things at so much risk. “And this fellow, sleeping perfectly well, did
not speak a single word; otherwise I would not have touched his things.
They are are of no value at all.”</p><p><br></p><p>And Farid said, “Of course I am the chooser, so I will choose which
things come to my lot and which things go to your lot. I am always a
master of any situation.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That I can see. You just choose quickly, otherwise the
neighbors will wake up and everything will be gone. You just take away
whatever you want. Don’t bother whether it is exactly fifty-fifty or
not.”</p><p><br></p><p>Farid was a very humorous man. He writes in his biography, “That was
such a joy to share. In the morning I went around and told people, ‘You
can come and take if your things are here. I could not manage one
hundred percent, because that would have been very difficult – that man
was tough. But still, at least sixty percent I have managed. So take
away your things and be careful about thieves. As for me it is okay.
What can he take away from me?’”</p><p><br></p><p>Dokai is saying that, in a single moment, to find the original man
within you, is like taking a thief into your house who steals everything
that you have collected around yourself, and leaves you naked as if you
are just born. From this just-born nakedness you may for the first time
feel a new throb, a new heartbeat, a new source of breathing and a new
growth. No longer conditioned by the society or by religion or by
education, you will start being yourself according to this vast
universe’s desire.</p><p><br></p><p>And the difference between you and the trees, and the flowers, and
the mountains will be that they are mountains not out of freedom. Roses
are roses not out of freedom, but whatever you are, you will be out of
your freedom. Originality and freedom – these two qualities combined
make you the awakened one, original and with freedom. Naturally, with
freedom, nobody is going to choose something against his nature. With
freedom one is going choicelessly with the flow of the wind, with the
flow of the river, wherever it leads.</p><p><br></p><p>Finding the original source, one finds a tremendous trust in oneself,
because one is now connected with the universe. Otherwise we are
rootless people, disconnected, just going here and there for no reason,
for no purpose – just tourists.</p><p>The easiest way to waste your time is to be a tourist. That is the
worst category of human beings: people who have nothing else to do, who
just know how to carry big suitcases and cameras and run from this place
to that place. And they are in such a hurry; they don’t see the Taj
Mahal, they just take a photograph. At home, at ease, they will look at
the picture. They are making an album which they could have purchased in
their own city, only more professional, more accurate. All this running
away...</p><p><br></p><p>But that’s what is happening in our actual lives. What are you trying
to be? Is it something that the society has told you to be, or is it out
of your autonomous freedom? Every child is being asked again and again,
“What are you going to be?”</p><p><br></p><p>In my childhood they used to ask me, “What are you going to be?” I
said, “That is not your concern. I am keeping it a secret.”</p><p>They said, “Strange, we have asked many children. Every child says he
is going to be a doctor, he is going to be an advocate, he is going to
be a leader, a politician, or he is going to be a sannyasin. You are the
only person who is saying, ‘This is not your concern’ – and to whom are
you talking?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I know, you are my uncle, you are my father, but that does
not mean that my growth is your concern. Just keep yourself out of my
way. I know where I am going!”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “Remember, you will end up as nothing!” I said, “I
know.”</p><p>And by chance I ended up as nothing. But I am so happy in my
nothingness, because it is my whole freedom. Nobody has imposed it on
me, it is my own choice. I have not allowed anybody even to touch it.
This has been my constant stand, from my early childhood up to
university.</p><p><br></p><p>The question was asked many times, “What are you going to be?” And
when they heard that “This is not your concern. You should take care of
yourself, I will take care of myself. Just don’t collide with me,” my
professors were hurt. They said, “We were asking out of sympathy.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I don’t want anybody’s sympathy. Never mention that dirty
word!” They said, “My God, ‘sympathy’, you call a dirty word?”</p><p>I said, “It is, because it is a substitute and all substitutes are
prostitutes.” They said, “Strange, from where do you get these
ideas?”</p><p>I said, “I don’t get them from anywhere. Can’t I make them up myself?
I don’t have to quote anybody, I quote myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody is trying to be somebody else, because the whole pressure
of society is to be somebody else. Nobody even takes note of what your
original program is, what the program you brought with you at your birth
is.</p><p>In a natural, peaceful, intelligent society this will be our first
task: to help every child to find out his program, not our program. And
even if his program goes against our program, it is out of love that we
should support him. We may not agree with him, but we should support
him. He has to follow his nature.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen is so insistent on the original man – not without reason, because
everybody has become a carbon copy of somebody else. This has become
almost a rule of the game. Zen is a rebellion: a rebellion against the
whole society’s past, a rebellion for the individual and his freedom to
choose his own destiny. It is not an ordinary revolution – a communist
revolution, a fascist revolution, a Gandhian revolution; these are just
mundane revolutions.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen is the deepest revolution within the individual himself. It has
nothing to do with the outside structure. And just to be oneself is the
greatest blessing and the greatest ecstasy.</p><p><br></p><p>NOT LOSING THE FUNDAMENTAL SOURCE IS LIKE A FOX FOND OF ITS
DEN...</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t lose the fundamental source of your life.</p><p><br></p><p>THEREFORE TRUE THUSNESS, ORDINARY AND HOLY, IS ALL DREAM TALK;
BUDDHAS AND SENTIENT BEINGS ARE EXPRESSIONS OF ASSUMPTIONS...</p><p><br></p><p>Only a great master can say such things. What is he saying? He is
saying that somebody is trying to be a buddha, somebody is trying to
find the original source – these are all mental assumptions. Even the
buddha is a concept.</p><p><br></p><p>You will have to drop the buddha. You will have to drop all your
assumptions and just look at the very center of your being, where there
is no assumption, where you are drowned into your original source. Get
rooted there, and then branches will shoot on their own accord and
flowers will come in their own time. You need not worry. Your only worry
should be that you are not distracted from your original source, that
you are not bribed from your original source, that you stick to one
point: “I am going to be myself, neither Gautam Buddha nor Jesus
Christ...”</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes I think it is good that they crucified Jesus, because that
fellow was pretending to be the son of God. That is absolute fantasy,
and we should not allow these kinds of people, otherwise somebody will
say, “I am the father of God.”</p><p><br></p><p>If Jesus is the son, somebody must be the father. And what about
uncles and aunts and the whole family? And you cannot prevent... if you
accept Jesus as the son, without any certificate, without any indication
from God himself, what is the problem in saying, “I am the grandfather
of Jesus?”</p><p><br></p><p>These are all assumptions. One should be just oneself. The moment
somebody tries to pretend to be somebody else, crucify him because he is
spreading a sickness in the society. He is going to pollute the minds of
people: “You have to be somebody special. You have to be a prophet, a
messenger, a messiah; otherwise you are just ordinary.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody wants to be ordinary. Even those you think are ordinary, in
their minds they think they are extraordinary. They smile without
showing you that “you are an idiot, I am extraordinary. You can</p><p>go on thinking that because you have a little more riches or a little
more political power... but that does not matter. The real thing is, I
am so extraordinary. I don’t care about riches or about political
power.”</p><p><br></p><p>Dokai is saying: NOT LOSING THE FUNDAMENTAL SOURCE IS LIKE A FOX FOND
OF ITS</p><p>DEN... Cling to your source. At any cost you have to remain being
yourself. You may end up just like me, into nothingness. I can only
share my experience, that being nothing is the greatest joy. But I don’t
want you to become nothing, I don’t want you to imitate! Remember the
difference.</p><p><br></p><p>I am saying, being yourself, the worst that can happen to you is that
you may end up into nothing. That happened to me, and I am feeling so
blissful that I cannot stop spreading the fire around, making people
courageous enough to explore their original source – even if they end up
into nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>NOT LOSING THE FUNDAMENTAL SOURCE IS LIKE A FOX FOND OF ITS DEN.
THEREFORE TRUE THUSNESS, ORDINARY AND HOLY, IS ALL DREAM TALK; BUDDHAS
AND SENTIENT BEINGS ARE EXPRESSIONS OF ASSUMPTIONS.</p><p><br></p><p>How do you know that a man is a buddha? Because he has said it to
you, but this is very gullible. How do you know that Jesus Christ is the
son of God? In the first place nobody knows about God, and suddenly,
this carpenter’s son – not actually the son of the carpenter, but of
somebody else who pretended to be the holy ghost...</p><p><br></p><p>He is talking about being the son of God, and the only son – and
people are trying to be like Jesus. One great classic of Christianity is
THE IMITATION OF CHRIST. How to imitate so that you can also become
Jesus.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to see the principal of a Christian theological college on the
way to the university, and we became friends. While coming and going I
was always stopping at his house for a little talk – certainly a great
theological talk. I would create some trouble in his mind for the whole
twenty-four hours until I saw him again.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, he said, “This stopping every day is very dangerous, because
it has taken away my peace of mind. You ask such questions!”</p><p><br></p><p>I had asked him: “I am reading THE IMITATION OF CHRIST, but the
ultimate should be the crucifixion; otherwise you are just a half-baked
potato. So what do you think about this great classic? At what point do
you stop following Christ? If you are really following him you will have
to bribe a few people to crucify you, because nowadays nobody is
interested in crucifying anybody. People have their work, their concerns
– who is interested?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “The whole night I could not sleep. I had always thought
that THE IMITATION OF CHRIST is a great book and you disturbed my whole
idea. Even in my dream I dreamed that somebody was crucifying me.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “My God, this is enough! I don’t want to discuss theology
with you because you create such strange theological questions which are
never discussed by great theologians. For example, this grandfather...
it is absolutely rational; otherwise the whole thing seems to be so
phony. God has</p><p>no father; the son is a bastard; nobody knows who this Holy Ghost is
– some gangster? What kind of theology is this?”</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be distracted either by Buddha or Jesus or Mahavira. Don’t be
distracted by anybody, including me. You have to be just yourself,
purely yourself. Only then can you attain to the ultimate bliss possible
to man.</p><p><br></p><p>Only then can you blossom into many flowers, and your life can be a
life of fulfillment, contentment, peace, without any tension at all.</p><p><br></p><p>The enlightened man is the original man come to his ultimate growth,
not imitating anybody but just insisting on being himself. The whole
society is trying to drag you somewhere else.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN YOU GET HERE, TURN THE LIGHT AROUND TO SHINE BACK, LET GO YOUR
HANDS AND ACCEPT IT – EVEN THEN YOU STILL WILL NOT HAVE ESCAPED BEING
LIKE A COLD CICADA CLINGING TO A DEAD TREE, NOT TURNING HIS HEAD WHEN
HIS CRYING ENDS.</p><p><br></p><p>DOKAI RAISED HIS STAFF AND CONCLUDED:</p><p><br></p><p>IF YOU CAN GET IT HERE, IT IS ALL SOMETHING SET UP BY THE BUDDHAS.
EVEN IF YOU CAN SPRING UP IN THE EAST AND DISAPPEAR IN THE WEST, OPEN
OUT OR SHUT AWAY FREELY, YOU STILL HAVEN’T EVEN DREAMED OF SEEING WHAT
WAS BEFORE THE BUDDHAS.</p><p><br></p><p>You can think of East and West, you can turn this way and that way,
but you are in the mind – you are not going out of the mind. You can
think, I am a buddha. There are religions which repeat it as mantra: I
am a buddha, I am a buddha. And if you repeat it many times
continuously, you may start thinking you are.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hindus go on thinking, aham brahmasmi, I am the ultimate – and
repeating it again and again and again. Naturally, the memory goes on
deeper and deeper and you may even, at the risk of your life, repeat
aham brahmasmi. That does not prove that you have reached the ultimate.
Al- Hillaj Mansoor was also crucified because he was saying “Ana’l haq!”
– I am God and I have sent Mohammed as a prophet. Now, Mohammedans
cannot accept even for a single moment somebody calling himself God and
reducing Mohammed to just a prophet.</p><p><br></p><p>Mansoor’s experience that “I am God” may have been just a mind trip.
That’s what his master Junnaid was telling him continuously, “Okay, you
are God, but what is the need of proclaiming it? Just keep quiet. Yes,
you are God but don’t say it to anybody.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mansoor said, “But when I AM God, why should I not say it?”</p><p><br></p><p>It was a beautiful dialogue between the master and the disciple.
Junnaid said, “In that case I am also God. And you know perfectly well
there are not two Gods.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That’s right. There is only one God.”</p><p>And how to deny the master – his own master? He says, “I am also God,
but I don’t say it to anybody because I don’t want to be unnecessarily
crucified. What is the point in it?”</p><p><br></p><p>It is a suicidal instinct according to Junnaid, and I think he is
right – that it is very psychological. But Mansoor did not listen to him
– and he was a very beautiful man. But the experience should not be
expressed by the word ‘God’, because that word is contaminated. That
word has become an obsession for millions of people of different
religions. It is better to avoid it.</p><p><br></p><p>He could have said, “I am pure consciousness,” and nobody would have
bothered about it. Who bothers about pure consciousness? If you are pure
consciousness, be! Nobody objects. If you say, “I am the original man,”
perfectly good! All those things are synonymous.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen chooses the most simple and most humanitarian words: the original
man. It contains all the buddhas and it contains all the gods, because
it contains the essence of the very existence.</p><p><br></p><p>YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THERE IS ONE MAN... This is the man I have been
talking about.</p><p><br></p><p>YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THERE IS ONE MAN WHO DOES NOT GET ANYTHING FROM
OTHERS, DOES NOT ACCEPT ANY TEACHING OR COMMAND, AND DOES NOT FALL
WITHIN THE SCOPE OF GRADE OR RANK. IF YOU KNOW THIS MAN, YOUR LIFE’S
STUDY IS COMPLETED. HERE DOKAI PAUSED AND SUDDENLY CALLED OUT TO THE
ASSEMBLY SAYING, “IF YOU FREEZE YOUR EYES ANY MORE, DON’T BOTHER TO SEE
ME.”</p><p><br></p><p>He is saying that if you still go on reading the scriptures and
freezing your eyes, or meditating and freezing your eyes, don’t come to
me again. Come to me again when you have found your original man. I have
described the man. I have given the indications and the qualifications
of the man.</p><p><br></p><p>Ikkyu wrote:</p><p><br></p><p>THE MIND OF MAN IS WITHOUT SOUND, WITHOUT ODOR.</p><p>HE WHO ANSWERS WHEN CALLED IS NOTHING BUT A THIEF.</p><p>He is saying that when you are so silent that there is no sound, no
odor, and somebody asks you, “Who are you?” only silence is the answer.
If you answer anything else – that I am the God, that I am the only
begotten son of God, that I am a messiah, that I am a buddha – then you
are nothing but a thief. You have borrowed these words from others, from
scriptures, but you have not known your original man.</p><p><br></p><p>Another poet wrote:</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE LANDSCAPE OF SPRING</p><p>THERE IS NEITHER HIGH NOR LOW;</p><p><br></p><p>THE FLOWERING BRANCHES GROW NATURALLY, SOME LONG, SOME SHORT.</p><p>The poet is saying that in nature there is no gradation, no
inferiority, no superiority.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who are short don’t feel inferior, those who grow long don’t
feel superior. Everything is accepted in its suchness. The original man,
once found, and you will not think in terms of gradations; you will not
think in terms of who is superior and who is inferior.</p><p><br></p><p>I was staying in a government guest house and two old men came to see
me.…</p><p><br></p><p>Both must have been eighty or eighty-five, and they told me, “We have
been friends from our childhood, but we have been in a constant quarrel
about the existence of God.” One was an atheist – he did not believe in
God. The other was a theist – he believed in God. They said, “We heard
you are here, so we thought it will be good to get another opinion about
it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I asked those old fellows, “Have you seen God?” – first to the man
who believed in God. He said, “No, I have not seen him. I believe, I
don’t know.”</p><p>I asked the second man, “Have you seen that there is no God?” He
said, “No, I have not seen. But I believe that there is no God.” I said,
“There is no disagreement between you two.”</p><p>They said, “What?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You both believe. On the point of seeing you both agree that
you have not seen. Where is the disagreement?”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at each other. They said, “The point is worth
considering, because neither I know nor you know, and we have been
quarreling for our whole lives.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Better discover, rather than believe. In believing you have
wasted your whole life.”</p><p><br></p><p>Discovery is possible in a single moment, but first you will have to
drop your beliefs. Disbeliefs are also beliefs, they are just negative
beliefs. There is no difference between theists and atheists. Both are
believers – one positively, one negatively. The seeker has to be
completely free from belief and disbelief. He has to be completely open
and available.</p><p><br></p><p>The original man is not far away on any star – he is hidden within
you. Question 1</p><p>Anando has asked:</p><p><br></p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>DOKAI SAYS IT IS ALL DREAM TALK. ARE YOUR WORDS THEN JUST AN EXCUSE
TO LULL US INTO A SPACE WHERE HOPEFULLY, SOME DAY, WE MAY BE READY FOR
THE SPECIAL TRANSMISSION?</p><p><br></p><p>You are ready for the special transmission right now, Anando. It just
needs courage to accept it.</p><p><br></p><p>The society has condemned you so deeply, the condemnation has gone so
deep in you that you never think you are worthy of anything. And to be
“worthy” of being the original man is not a question of worth, it is not
a question of deserving.</p><p><br></p><p>You are.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if you deny it, still you are.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if you try to escape somewhere else, it will be within you.</p><p><br></p><p>So, Anando, Dokai is right when he says all is talk. You just stop
talking, stop thinking – and the original man is there. All that is
needed is to give a little gap and you will find a fresh growth, a
flame, arising from your very center. That’s what we are trying to
do.</p><p><br></p><p>First, I am trying to convince you that I am not a scripture, I am a
living human being as you are. I am not superior, I don’t have any
relationship with God – I am not even a faraway cousin! I am simply just
as you are. The difference is so small, it is not even worth mentioning:
I know it, and you are looking here and there, not looking at the right
point.</p><p><br></p><p>On the contrary, you are avoiding it, because if you find it there
may be troubles. Do you want to be crucified? Do you want to be
poisoned? Do you want to be killed? It is better just to be a doctor, a
grocer, a film actress, a hairdresser, and not to bother about this
original man. These original men have always gotten into trouble – it is
better to avoid.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole history of man is wrong because it has always crushed the
original. It wants carbon copies, it wants slaves; it does not want
independent people.</p><p><br></p><p>Independent people will always be rebellious, rebellious in the sense
that they will do something only if it fits with their nature. They will
not do anything that goes against their nature. The society wants
slaves, the society wants obedience.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s how the Bible starts the story of the world. Adam and Eve are
thrown out of the garden of God because they disobeyed. Disobedience is
the greatest sin, because disobedience means you are going to be a
rebellious person. You will do things which you like. You will not be
enslaved by vested interests. Otherwise no problem is there preventing
you from asserting your original nature. This very moment you can say,
“I am my original nature,” and you can drop all the faces, masks,
personalities. You will just be simple.</p><p>People are so unbelievably stupid. In the Middle Ages in England,
even dogs had clothes, because to see a naked dog is pornography.
Strange, what about the horses and the donkeys and the elephants? How
are you going to put clothes on all these people? The whole of humanity
will be involved in dry cleaning continuously. There will be no other
business. Even the legs of chairs and tables were covered because
‘legs’... the word reminds you of something. But in fact the covered
legs remind you more. Uncovered they are just wooden legs, but covered,
one never knows...!</p><p><br></p><p>People have been hiding nature in every possible way: trying to
pretend, in the name of etiquette; smiling when you really want to hit,
holding back your tears when you want to cry, because a man should not
cry; it is only for the weaker sex, for women, to cry to their hearts’
content – and they do. That’s why they are less sick, live longer, are
healthier in every way than men, more joyous... and they have a sense of
humor.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is such a dodo. But he has been made a dodo. All his reality has
been covered. He has to behave like a gentleman.</p><p><br></p><p>Otherwise, Anando, there is no problem at all. I am talking to you to
destroy the conditionings, and I am helping you to enter into meditation
so that you can find your original self. I don’t give you any ideals. I
don’t want you to be somebody other than yourself. And if you are taking
time, I am not responsible for it. I am reaching you every day, but I
find your doors are closed. The moment your doors are open, the
transmission will happen immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>The transmission is a simple phenomenon. It is just waking you up,
but you are sleeping with closed doors. I cannot even enter in your
room. Sleep with open doors, don’t be afraid. If I don’t enter, somebody
will enter and wake you up. The whole question is of waking you up.</p><p><br></p><p>Every day we are meditating, you reach very close to the center, but
the conditionings are millions of years old. You go with hesitation. I
go on forcing you: “A little more, a little more.”</p><p><br></p><p>Poor Nivedano has to go on beating his drum, and the drum is becoming
enlightened, not Nivedano. Nivedano is Nivedano, he will always beat the
drum. And when he sees that you are not getting the point, he beats
more, but he is completely unaware that he has also to become
enlightened. I am leaving him for the time being. When you all have
become enlightened, then you can all beat Nivedano. And in a single
moment he will jump up, and he will say, “I am enlightened. No need to
beat me!”</p><p><br></p><p>I trust him – that’s why I am not putting him into meditation. But he
is earning great virtue by trying to beat the drum, and he is
enjoying.</p><p><br></p><p>Anando, it is just a question of dropping all conditioning. You can
do it retail or you can do it wholesale. I would prefer that you do it
wholesale because retail is a long process. This day is as good as any
day. This moment is as good as any moment. But I will go on trying, inch
by inch, that you go in; little by little, that you gather courage.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not going to leave you unless you jump into your original
source. You can delay, but you cannot stop. Before Nivedano tries to
drum your heads... He is not beating his drum, remember, that is just an
excuse. He is beating your heads. Before getting into that serious work
of finding the original man, a few laughs will make you ready.</p><p>Leroy, a huge black guy, walks into a bar with a parrot on his
shoulder. “Hey!” says the bartender, “Where did you get that?”</p><p>“Africa,” replies the parrot.</p><p><br></p><p>Kowalski’s son, Kowalski Junior, comes back from college and asks his
dad a riddle: “What is long and hard and leaks?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Son!” exclaims Kowalski, “I can’t believe you would use such vulgar
expressions.” “Don’t get excited, Dad,” says the boy. “It is a pen.”</p><p>Kowalski is very amused by this trick, and he decides to repeat it at
his next church gathering.</p><p><br></p><p>“My son told me this riddle which he heard at college,” brags
Kowalski, proudly. “What is long and hard and leaks?”</p><p><br></p><p>There is a gasp from his listeners and the ladies all raise their
hands to their mouths in horror. “Don’t get excited, ladies,” says
Kowalski. “It is a pen, not a prick!”</p><p>Old man Finkelstein, the shopkeeper, is waiting at the entrance to
the Pearly Gates while Saint Peter speaks to Leroy, a big black guy, who
has also just died.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can have anything you want,” says Saint Peter. “I’d like a
million dollars,” says Leroy.</p><p>“Done!” says Peter, and Leroy walks away with a suitcase stuffed with
dollar bills.</p><p><br></p><p>Then St. Peter turns to Finkelstein and says, “You’ll be granted any
wish you make. What would you like?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” says the Fink, “I’d like twenty dollars worth of fake
jewelry, and about ten minutes with that black guy!”</p><p><br></p><p>Mildred Maxwell is surrounded by all of her sad friends as they look
down into her husband, Melvin’s grave.</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m so sorry,” says Mildred’s priest, Father Flab. “What did he die
of?” “Gonorrhea,” replies Mildred, sadly.</p><p>Then her neighbor, Peaches, comes up and says, “Oh Mildred, I’m so
sorry this happened. What did the poor man die of?”</p><p><br></p><p>“He died of gonorrhea,” says Mildred somberly.</p><p>Old Mrs. Hucksteen comes to give her condolences.</p><p><br></p><p>“The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away,” says the old lady. “And
now he has taken Melvin. What was it dear, a heart attack?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No,” says Mildred quietly, “gonorrhea.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mildred’s sister Mabel finally comes up to her. “Mildred!” whispers
Mabel tensely, “What are you telling people? Melvin did not die of
gonorrhea, he died of diarrhea!”</p><p><br></p><p>“I know,” says Mildred. “But I would rather people think he went out
like a playboy, and not like the shit he was!”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, Nivedano... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Be silent, close your eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Feel your body to be completely frozen, no movement.</p><p><br></p><p>Gather your consciousness inside, and just like an arrow, let this
consciousness go deeper and deeper until it hits the source of your
being.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no fear because on this road to your self you are not going
to meet anybody. Deeper and deeper.</p><p>This moment you are the original man. This moment you are the
buddha.</p><p>Remember it, twenty-four hours – not like a parrot.</p><p><br></p><p>Let it become your breathing, your heartbeat, your blood circulation,
so that in every action and gesture this originality, this spontaneity
is expressed without any effort.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is the greatest revolution in the world because it brings
the original man into existence. It is always there but every society
pushes it under many, many covers. Our work here is to throw all those
covers, all those layers and find the real, the original, the
natural.</p><p>Start your growth from your natural center. Then whatever you may be,
you will find contentment, you will find great joy in life. You will
find not only joy in life, but in death too, because your original
nature is eternal.</p><p><br></p><p>Birth is a drama, life is a drama, death is a drama. Only your
original consciousness is the watcher. Dramas change, the watcher
remains.</p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Relax, let go. The body is lying there – you just be a watcher of
body and mind both, simply a watcher. This watcher is the original
man.</p><p><br></p><p>Rejoice that you have found it. Feel silently grateful that you have
found it. Now don’t forget the root.</p><p><br></p><p>Every day go on pushing deeper and deeper, because the original man
has a circumference and also a center. First you will touch the
circumference, and then your arrow will enter into the center.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you have entered into the center, you have gone beyond life and
death. You have become one with the universe.</p><p><br></p><p>Nivedano, make your drum enlightened again! (Drumbeat)</p><p>Come back, slowly, so that you can carry the experience with you.
Silently, gracefully, sit down as a buddha, without any hesitation,
without any doubt.</p><p><br></p><p>You are the buddha, the awakened soul.</p><p><br></p><p>At least for this moment you are blessed with the ultimate ecstasy,
and all the invisible flowers are showering over you.</p><p><br></p><p>Feel grateful.</p><p><br></p><p>There is nothing more religious than gratefulness. There is no other
prayer than gratefulness.</p><p>It is a Thank You to existence. Okay, Anando?</p><p>Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p>Can we celebrate the gathering of the ten thousand buddhas? Yes!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

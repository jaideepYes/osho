AND QUESTION TWO:\nYOU ARE LIKE AN EXOTIC FLOWER OR RARE SPECIES OF CREATURE WHOM I HAVE WATCHED AND LISTENED TO AND TRIED TO FIND WORDS TO DESCRIBE FOR THE PAST FOURTEEN YEARS.\nTO HEAR YOU TALK OF THE STATE YOU ARE IN IS TO FEEL ENDLESSLY IN AWE. ONE OF THE MOST INTRIGUING THINGS ABOUT YOU IS THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS SO ABSOLUTELY PRESENT AND AT THE SAME TIME SO TOTALLY ABSENT.\nWOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT? AND THE THIRD:\nOSHO, OKAY... I’M GOING TO LIGHTEN UP.… FOR A MASTER OF YAA-HOO AND YAA-BOO WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE TABOO?\nThe death we know is always somebody else. Once we know our own death, pass through it, a tremendous realization arises that death is the greatest fiction.\nThis realization is called “the great death.” Everybody dies, but the small death; only very blessed ones have died the great death. It simply means they die with total awareness, seeing body and mind separating from their consciousness. But the consciousness, the flame of their being is eternal. It goes on moving into new forms and ultimately it moves into the formless.\nThis small anecdote is about the great death. Zen is always special in its expression. Joshu calls it the great death because it is not death. The great death in reality is the great life.\nOnly the small death is death.\nThe difference is of consciousness and unconsciousness. You die unconsciously – this is the small death; you will have a small rebirth. Neither will you know your death nor will you know your birth. If you die meditatively, alert, aware, it is the great death – and great death is followed by great birth.\nKnowingly you die, and because knowingly you die... how can you die? Your knowing, your consciousness continues – knowingly you are born. There is no discontinuity between your death and your birth.\nYour realization of this ordinarily would be called “the great life,” but there is some reason why Zen has chosen to call it the great death. The reason is that the great death comes first; behind it is revealed the great life. Unless you open the door of the great death, you won’t enter into the space of great life.\nJOSHU ASKED TOSU, “WHAT IF A MAN OF THE GREAT DEATH COMES BACK TO LIFE AGAIN?”\nNow another distinction has to be made which is not clear in the anecdote and is not commented upon by Setcho either. But without bringing in another distinction the experience remains incomplete; it is not entire.\nThere is death\nthere is the great death\nand there is the greatest death.\nIn death you die unconsciously. In the great death you die consciously, but you are born again. In the greatest death you only die; you are not reborn, you simply disappear into the immensity of existence – you disperse yourself in the wholeness of the cosmos.\nIt is because of this fact Mahavira cannot be born again. There is no way for him to get back into any form; he has become formless. But there are meditators who have not reached the ultimate peak but who have some light, some consciousness, that remains while they are dying. They will be born again; they are not yet ripe enough to disappear into the cosmos. They have not learned the whole secret and mystery of life; they have to go on the pilgrimage a little more.\nJoshu’s question is, “WHAT IF A MAN OF THE GREAT DEATH COMES BACK TO LIFE AGAIN?”\nHis question seems to be relevant, because there is no precedence in which a third kind of death is recognized. He is asking: “I can understand the great death, that you die consciously, but what about a man dying consciously and coming back to life again?”\nHe is asking about the third distinction, because we have known of many people simply disappearing into air and they never come back again – and there are millions who go on coming back. They never learn their homework; their lives remain mundane and unconscious. But even if sometimes a few people become a little bit conscious, it is better than not being conscious at all. These people will be born – and from their very birth they will show distinctions, uniquenesses, which ordinary children are not supposed to show.\nBut this is not the ultimate death which everybody is seeking. Only in ultimate death do you relax totally into existence, not to come back. This coming back is not something great; it is coming back to the prison.\nTOSU SAID, “YOU SHOULD NOT GO BY NIGHT; WAIT FOR THE LIGHT OF DAY AND COME.”\nSlowly, slowly you will be getting the taste of the language of Zen. Rather than saying, “You should not die unconsciously,” he says, YOU SHOULD NOT GO BY NIGHT – don’t go in darkness, don’t go blind – WAIT FOR THE LIGHT OF DAY... Wait for consciousness, wait for witnessing. Wait for meditation to grow in you and then you can come.\nSETCHO COMMENTS:\nOPEN-EYED, HE WAS ALL THE MORE AS IF DEAD.\nThat’s how a great master is. In his being, death and life have become one. There is no separation between death and life.\nOPEN-EYED, HE WAS ALL THE MORE AS IF DEAD;\nWHAT USE TO TEST THE MASTER WITH SOMETHING TABOO?\nSuch questions should not be asked – that’s what Setcho is commenting. Such questions are of such a great depth that there is no way to answer them. Why put somebody in an embarrassing situation? Hence such questions are taboo.\nEVEN THE BUDDHA SAID HE HAD NOT REACHED THERE – just to avoid the answer. He must have been asked many times in his forty-two-years-long life of teaching. Rather than putting a lock on their mouths, he said to his questioners, “I have not reached there yet, so I cannot answer it.” But it is not true, because he has not returned and he cannot return. That does not mean that others cannot become as awakened, as enlightened as Gautam Buddha. It simply means that the unique personality of Gautam Buddha will never be seen again in the world of time and space.\nWHO KNOWS WHEN TO THROW ASHES IN ANOTHER’S EYES?\nSetcho is saying, “Buddha is simply throwing ashes into the eyes of the questioner.” You cannot deceive an authentic questioner, because the authentic questioner himself knows it a little bit – that death is a fiction, that life is eternal.\nBut even Buddha is trying to throw ashes into the eyes of the questioner. It must be out of compassion. He does not want you to think much about death; he wants you to think much about life. He wants you to go deeper into life, and death will disappear on its own accord. The more alive you are, the farther away death is. When you are totally alive, there is no death for you. Of course you will not be in a form, you will be a pure isness spread all over the existence. Not confined in a body of any species, just a white cloud floating in the open sky, unconfined to any form.\nHave you ever watched a cloud moving in the sky? It has no form, because its form goes on changing. It is free of any bondage to remain in the same form. It is free as far as form is concerned.\nIt is freedom.\nQuestion 1\nManeesha’s first question is:\n“OSHO, YOU ARE ONE WHO HAS COME BACK TO LIFE FROM THE GREAT DEATH. YET WE WHO HAVE NOT DIED ARE NOT NEARLY SO ABUNDANTLY ALIVE AS YOU. WOULD YOU PLEASE TALK ABOUT THIS?”\nI have been teaching you nothing else except to be more alive, more loving, more singing, more dancing...\nMy approach is not the approach of Gautam Buddha. His approach is negative. On his path there are no dances, no songs. On his path you will not find any oasis. His path is perfectly right; it reaches, although it is hard.\nBut when there is a choice, why choose the hard? Why not choose the way of dancing and singing and being aware – and move through gardens where flowers blossom. There is no need to move through deserts where nothing grows.\nIt was a historical necessity for Gautam Buddha to move through the desert, but it is not for you. What was the historical necessity for him to move through the desert? For twenty-nine years he lived in beautiful gardens, in palaces, surrounded by beautiful women, song, dance... He was tired of it. It all created a kind of negativity because he knew that this is not life. I was not there to teach him that this in itself is not life, but if you just add a little awareness to it, it is life – more life. There is no need to go on a desert path.\nI am teaching you to reach to the same goal of ultimate death, but I would rather call it ultimate life. That’s where my expression and Gautam Buddha’s expression differs.\nI don’t think that his path of negativity has helped humanity very much; in fact, who wants to die? Have you ever asked yourself – do you want to die? An ultimate death, with no possibility of turning back? And for this ultimate death making all kinds of disciplines, rituals, following a thousand and one rules – you will certainly think that this is mad. If in the end you are only going to gain the ultimate death... It doesn’t seem right. And that’s why Buddhism has not been of as much help as it could have been.\nBut it was Buddha’s individual necessity. He had lived the life of immense luxury – he was tired of it. If this is life then he does not want to live. He moved in the opposite direction to find the truth. But you have not lived the life of Buddha, the luxury that was available to him. You need not be, and you cannot be negative in your approach. Your approach can only be positive.\nAnd if dancing you can reach to the ultimate, laughing, if you can reach to the ultimate, then why unnecessarily go with a British face? There are other faces also! Don’t be serious.\nBut death... the very word makes people serious.\nI want you even to dance in your death, to dance and celebrate even in the death of your loved ones. Life and death both should be part of a single festival without any discontinuity.\nQuestion 2\nYour second question is:\n“OSHO, YOU ARE LIKE AN EXOTIC FLOWER OR RARE SPECIES OF CREATURE WHOM I HAVE WATCHED AND LISTENED TO AND TRIED TO FIND WORDS TO DESCRIBE FOR THE PAST FOURTEEN YEARS. TO HEAR YOU TALK OF THE STATE YOU ARE IN IS TO FEEL ENDLESSLY IN AWE. ONE OF THE MOST INTRIGUING THINGS ABOUT YOU IS THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS SO ABSOLUTELY PRESENT AND AT THE SAME TIME SO TOTALLY ABSENT. WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?”\nManeesha, totality has two sides: the presence and the absence.\nYou cannot be totally present if you cannot be totally absent at the same time, simultaneously – you cannot choose one.\nJust the very word ‘total’ includes presence and absence both. Your understanding is accurate. You have felt rightly that I am present – at the same time I am not present. This has to be your state also. Only then – the meeting, the communion.\nOnce in a while you have, for a moment, come to the place where you meet me – but soon your mind takes you away. You come very close to the waters and yet you remain thirsty. Your mind takes another route which goes away from the waters.\nIn this silence you are both: totally present and totally absent.\nThis presence, this absence, this totality has to become your whole life.\nJust because you could get the feel of an ultimate fact, Zen master Niskriya will have to reward you. Such an understanding should not go without reward.\nMaster Niskriya!\nBring your staff.…\n(MASTER NISKRIYA GENTLY TAPS MANEESHA’S HEAD.)\nRight!\nOne hit to yourself also.… Good!\nQuestion 3\nYour third question, Maneesha, is very simple. I wonder how you missed the simplicity of it. You say: “OSHO, OKAY, I’M GOING TO LIGHTEN UP.…\nFOR A MASTER OF YAA-HOO AND YAA-BOO WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE TABOO?”\nTaboo is the Only Begotten Son of Yaa-Hoo and Yaa-Boo! In this small statement is implied the whole Christian trinity, and in a far better way because the Christian trinity has no woman in it. And without a woman, what have these three guys been doing?\nThe father is there – but where is the mother? The holy ghost... This holy ghost is a strange fellow! If he can make Virgin Mary pregnant, certainly he is not a woman. So he cannot be the mother; in fact, he is Jesus’ father. And who Jesus thinks is his father, is his uncle. “Father, uncle and son” – that seems to be more comprehensible, logical.\nThe trinity that you have made is perfect.…\nYaa-Hoo is the father, Yaa-Boo is the mother, Taa-Boo is the son, the only begotten son. Here is a whole religion!\nNow some irreligious things.…\nIt is a few nights after Christmas. The door of the stable creaks open and three wise men enter.\nThey are tiptoeing quietly across to the manger when one of them steps into a huge pile of donkey shit.\nLooking down at his ruined golden slipper, the wise man clenches his teeth and mutters, “Jesus Christ!”\nMary looks from her baby to her husband, “Hey! Joe!” she says, “that’s a much better name than Albert!”\nSolomon Liebowitz owns a little pharmacy in New York.\nOne day his assistant, Danny, comes running into the back and cries, “Mister Liebowitz, there is a man in the shop who wants to buy some arsenic to kill himself. What shall I do?”\n“Is he a good Jew, like ourselves?” asks Sollie. “He certainly is,” replies Danny.\n“Okay,” says Solomon “tell him that to kill himself he will need twenty dollars worth... He will soon change his mind!”\nOne day Lupo is walking home when he notices a huge gorilla standing on the roof of his house.\nNot knowing what to do about it he looks in the phone book under GORILLA REMOVALS. Then he calls up Kowalski’s Get Lost Gorilla Service and explains the situation.\nTen minutes later Kowalski arrives with a banana, a bulldog, a butterfly net, a ladder and a loaded gun.\n“Okay,” says Kowalski, “it is quite a simple thing. I am gonna throw the banana at the gorilla, and while he is busy eating it, I am gonna climb up the ladder and push him off the roof.\n“Then the bulldog is trained to grab him by the nuts, and when the gorilla holds himself in pain, you throw this butterfly net over him.”\n“Great!” shouts Lupo, with enthusiasm. “But what about the gun?”\n“Well,” explains Kowalski, “if I miss the gorilla and fall off the roof myself, you shoot the dog!”\nThe Western Australia Old Ladies’ Discussion Group meets each week, but all they ever talk about is cocks and pricks. After a while the ladies get worried because they use the words so much – and they might let them slip out in public. So they decide to substitute the words ‘prick’ and ‘cock’ with other words which won’t sound bad if they say them by mistake outside the club.\nThey write to Old Ladies’ Clubs all over the world to ask for advice.\nThe British Old Ladies’ Club writes back and says they use the word ‘gentleman’ because he always stands up when a lady comes in.\nThe Italians use the word ‘curtain’ because it goes up when the show begins and comes down when the show is over.\nThe Americans use ‘chewing gum’ because it goes in hard and comes out soft.\nAnd finally, the French say that they use the word ‘anecdote’ – but with no explanation. So one of the Australian ladies finds a dictionary and looks up the word.\n“Here we are,” she says to the others: “‘Anecdote: A little story that goes around from mouth to mouth.’”\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\nNow, two minutes of silence.… Relax.\nNow come back.\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2889","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/live_zen/part13/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/live_zen/>Live Zen</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">13 The great death</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2889 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Live_Zen/part13.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

LIFE AGAIN?”</p><p><br></p><p>His question seems to be relevant, because there is no precedence in
which a third kind of death is recognized. He is asking: “I can
understand the great death, that you die consciously, but what about a
man dying consciously and coming back to life again?”</p><p><br></p><p>He is asking about the third distinction, because we have known of
many people simply disappearing into air and they never come back again
– and there are millions who go on coming back. They never learn their
homework; their lives remain mundane and unconscious. But even if
sometimes a few people become a little bit conscious, it is better than
not being conscious at all. These people will be born – and from their
very birth they will show distinctions, uniquenesses, which ordinary
children are not supposed to show.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is not the ultimate death which everybody is seeking. Only
in ultimate death do you relax totally into existence, not to come back.
This coming back is not something great; it is coming back to the
prison.</p><p><br></p><p>TOSU SAID, “YOU SHOULD NOT GO BY NIGHT; WAIT FOR THE LIGHT OF DAY AND
COME.”</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly, slowly you will be getting the taste of the language of Zen.
Rather than saying, “You should not die unconsciously,” he says, YOU
SHOULD NOT GO BY NIGHT – don’t go in darkness, don’t go blind – WAIT FOR
THE LIGHT OF DAY... Wait for consciousness, wait for witnessing. Wait
for meditation to grow in you and then you can come.</p><p><br></p><p>SETCHO COMMENTS:</p><p><br></p><p>OPEN-EYED, HE WAS ALL THE MORE AS IF DEAD.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s how a great master is. In his being, death and life have
become one. There is no separation between death and life.</p><p><br></p><p>OPEN-EYED, HE WAS ALL THE MORE AS IF DEAD;</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT USE TO TEST THE MASTER WITH SOMETHING TABOO?</p><p><br></p><p>Such questions should not be asked – that’s what Setcho is
commenting. Such questions are of such a great depth that there is no
way to answer them. Why put somebody in an embarrassing situation? Hence
such questions are taboo.</p><p><br></p><p>EVEN THE BUDDHA SAID HE HAD NOT REACHED THERE – just to avoid the
answer. He must have been asked many times in his forty-two-years-long
life of teaching. Rather than putting a lock on their mouths, he said to
his questioners, “I have not reached there yet, so I cannot answer it.”
But it is not true, because he has not returned and he cannot return.
That does not mean that others cannot become as awakened, as enlightened
as Gautam Buddha. It simply means that the unique personality of Gautam
Buddha will never be seen again in the world of time and space.</p><p><br></p><p>WHO KNOWS WHEN TO THROW ASHES IN ANOTHER’S EYES?</p><p><br></p><p>Setcho is saying, “Buddha is simply throwing ashes into the eyes of
the questioner.” You cannot deceive an authentic questioner, because the
authentic questioner himself knows it a little bit – that death is a
fiction, that life is eternal.</p><p><br></p><p>But even Buddha is trying to throw ashes into the eyes of the
questioner. It must be out of compassion. He does not want you to think
much about death; he wants you to think much about life. He wants you to
go deeper into life, and death will disappear on its own accord. The
more alive you are, the farther away death is. When you are totally
alive, there is no death for you. Of course you will not be in a form,
you will be a pure isness spread all over the existence. Not confined in
a body of any species, just a white cloud floating in the open sky,
unconfined to any form.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever watched a cloud moving in the sky? It has no form,
because its form goes on changing. It is free of any bondage to remain
in the same form. It is free as far as form is concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>It is freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha’s first question is:</p><p><br></p><p>“OSHO, YOU ARE ONE WHO HAS COME BACK TO LIFE FROM THE GREAT DEATH.
YET WE WHO HAVE NOT DIED ARE NOT NEARLY SO ABUNDANTLY ALIVE AS YOU.
WOULD YOU PLEASE TALK ABOUT THIS?”</p><p><br></p><p>I have been teaching you nothing else except to be more alive, more
loving, more singing, more dancing...</p><p><br></p><p>My approach is not the approach of Gautam Buddha. His approach is
negative. On his path there are no dances, no songs. On his path you
will not find any oasis. His path is perfectly right; it reaches,
although it is hard.</p><p><br></p><p>But when there is a choice, why choose the hard? Why not choose the
way of dancing and singing and being aware – and move through gardens
where flowers blossom. There is no need to move through deserts where
nothing grows.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a historical necessity for Gautam Buddha to move through the
desert, but it is not for you. What was the historical necessity for him
to move through the desert? For twenty-nine years he lived in beautiful
gardens, in palaces, surrounded by beautiful women, song, dance... He
was tired of it. It all created a kind of negativity because he knew
that this is not life. I was not there to teach him that this in itself
is not life, but if you just add a little awareness to it, it is life –
more life. There is no need to go on a desert path.</p><p>I am teaching you to reach to the same goal of ultimate death, but I
would rather call it ultimate life. That’s where my expression and
Gautam Buddha’s expression differs.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t think that his path of negativity has helped humanity very
much; in fact, who wants to die? Have you ever asked yourself – do you
want to die? An ultimate death, with no possibility of turning back? And
for this ultimate death making all kinds of disciplines, rituals,
following a thousand and one rules – you will certainly think that this
is mad. If in the end you are only going to gain the ultimate death...
It doesn’t seem right. And that’s why Buddhism has not been of as much
help as it could have been.</p><p>But it was Buddha’s individual necessity. He had lived the life of
immense luxury – he was tired of it. If this is life then he does not
want to live. He moved in the opposite direction to find the truth. But
you have not lived the life of Buddha, the luxury that was available to
him. You need not be, and you cannot be negative in your approach. Your
approach can only be positive.</p><p>And if dancing you can reach to the ultimate, laughing, if you can
reach to the ultimate, then why unnecessarily go with a British face?
There are other faces also! Don’t be serious.</p><p><br></p><p>But death... the very word makes people serious.</p><p><br></p><p>I want you even to dance in your death, to dance and celebrate even
in the death of your loved ones. Life and death both should be part of a
single festival without any discontinuity.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>Your second question is:</p><p><br></p><p>“OSHO, YOU ARE LIKE AN EXOTIC FLOWER OR RARE SPECIES OF CREATURE WHOM
I HAVE WATCHED AND LISTENED TO AND TRIED TO FIND WORDS TO DESCRIBE FOR
THE PAST FOURTEEN YEARS. TO HEAR YOU TALK OF THE STATE YOU ARE IN IS TO
FEEL ENDLESSLY IN AWE. ONE OF THE MOST INTRIGUING THINGS ABOUT YOU IS
THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS SO ABSOLUTELY PRESENT AND AT THE SAME TIME SO
TOTALLY ABSENT. WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?”</p><p>Maneesha, totality has two sides: the presence and the absence.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot be totally present if you cannot be totally absent at the
same time, simultaneously – you cannot choose one.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the very word ‘total’ includes presence and absence both. Your
understanding is accurate. You have felt rightly that I am present – at
the same time I am not present. This has to be your state also. Only
then – the meeting, the communion.</p><p><br></p><p>Once in a while you have, for a moment, come to the place where you
meet me – but soon your mind takes you away. You come very close to the
waters and yet you remain thirsty. Your mind takes another route which
goes away from the waters.</p><p><br></p><p>In this silence you are both: totally present and totally absent.</p><p><br></p><p>This presence, this absence, this totality has to become your whole
life.</p><p><br></p><p>Just because you could get the feel of an ultimate fact, Zen master
Niskriya will have to reward you. Such an understanding should not go
without reward.</p><p><br></p><p>Master Niskriya!</p><p><br></p><p>Bring your staff.…</p><p><br></p><p>(MASTER NISKRIYA GENTLY TAPS MANEESHA’S HEAD.)</p><p><br></p><p>Right!</p><p><br></p><p>One hit to yourself also.… Good!</p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>Your third question, Maneesha, is very simple. I wonder how you
missed the simplicity of it. You say: “OSHO, OKAY, I’M GOING TO LIGHTEN
UP.…</p><p>FOR A MASTER OF YAA-HOO AND YAA-BOO WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE
TABOO?”</p><p>Taboo is the Only Begotten Son of Yaa-Hoo and Yaa-Boo! In this small
statement is implied the whole Christian trinity, and in a far better
way because the Christian trinity has no woman in it. And without a
woman, what have these three guys been doing?</p><p><br></p><p>The father is there – but where is the mother? The holy ghost... This
holy ghost is a strange fellow! If he can make Virgin Mary pregnant,
certainly he is not a woman. So he cannot be the mother; in fact, he is
Jesus’ father. And who Jesus thinks is his father, is his uncle.
“Father, uncle and son” – that seems to be more comprehensible,
logical.</p><p><br></p><p>The trinity that you have made is perfect.…</p><p><br></p><p>Yaa-Hoo is the father, Yaa-Boo is the mother, Taa-Boo is the son, the
only begotten son. Here is a whole religion!</p><p><br></p><p>Now some irreligious things.…</p><p><br></p><p>It is a few nights after Christmas. The door of the stable creaks
open and three wise men enter.</p><p><br></p><p>They are tiptoeing quietly across to the manger when one of them
steps into a huge pile of donkey shit.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking down at his ruined golden slipper, the wise man clenches his
teeth and mutters, “Jesus Christ!”</p><p><br></p><p>Mary looks from her baby to her husband, “Hey! Joe!” she says,
“that’s a much better name than Albert!”</p><p><br></p><p>Solomon Liebowitz owns a little pharmacy in New York.</p><p><br></p><p>One day his assistant, Danny, comes running into the back and cries,
“Mister Liebowitz, there is a man in the shop who wants to buy some
arsenic to kill himself. What shall I do?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Is he a good Jew, like ourselves?” asks Sollie. “He certainly is,”
replies Danny.</p><p>“Okay,” says Solomon “tell him that to kill himself he will need
twenty dollars worth... He will soon change his mind!”</p><p><br></p><p>One day Lupo is walking home when he notices a huge gorilla standing
on the roof of his house.</p><p><br></p><p>Not knowing what to do about it he looks in the phone book under
GORILLA REMOVALS. Then he calls up Kowalski’s Get Lost Gorilla Service
and explains the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Ten minutes later Kowalski arrives with a banana, a bulldog, a
butterfly net, a ladder and a loaded gun.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay,” says Kowalski, “it is quite a simple thing. I am gonna throw
the banana at the gorilla, and while he is busy eating it, I am gonna
climb up the ladder and push him off the roof.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then the bulldog is trained to grab him by the nuts, and when the
gorilla holds himself in pain, you throw this butterfly net over
him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great!” shouts Lupo, with enthusiasm. “But what about the gun?”</p><p>“Well,” explains Kowalski, “if I miss the gorilla and fall off the
roof myself, you shoot the dog!”</p><p><br></p><p>The Western Australia Old Ladies’ Discussion Group meets each week,
but all they ever talk about is cocks and pricks. After a while the
ladies get worried because they use the words so much – and they might
let them slip out in public. So they decide to substitute the words
‘prick’ and ‘cock’ with other words which won’t sound bad if they say
them by mistake outside the club.</p><p><br></p><p>They write to Old Ladies’ Clubs all over the world to ask for
advice.</p><p><br></p><p>The British Old Ladies’ Club writes back and says they use the word
‘gentleman’ because he always stands up when a lady comes in.</p><p><br></p><p>The Italians use the word ‘curtain’ because it goes up when the show
begins and comes down when the show is over.</p><p><br></p><p>The Americans use ‘chewing gum’ because it goes in hard and comes out
soft.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally, the French say that they use the word ‘anecdote’ – but
with no explanation. So one of the Australian ladies finds a dictionary
and looks up the word.</p><p><br></p><p>“Here we are,” she says to the others: “‘Anecdote: A little story
that goes around from mouth to mouth.’”</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, two minutes of silence.… Relax.</p><p>Now come back.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

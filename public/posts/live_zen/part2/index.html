NOW MAKE YOUR BOWS AND RETIRE.”\nSETCHO SAYS:\nTHE REAL WAY IS NOT DIFFICULT. DIRECT WORD! DIRECT SPEECH! ONE WITH MANY PHASES.\nTWO WITH ONE.\nFAR AWAY IN THE HEAVENS THE SUN RISES, THE MOON SETS; BEYOND THE HILLS THE HIGH MOUNTAINS, THE COLD WATERS. THE SKULL HAS NO CONSCIOUSNESS, NO DELIGHT;\nTHE DEAD TREE SINGS IN THE WIND, NOT YET ROTTEN. DIFFICULT, DIFFICULT!\nATTACHMENT AND CLARITY; WATCH, AND PENETRATE THE SECRET! OSHO,\nIN LIFE ONE CONTINUALLY HAS TO MAKE PRACTICAL DECISIONS – ABOUT HOW ONE WILL USE ONE’S TIME AND ENERGY, WITH WHOM ONE WILL KEEP COMPANY, WHAT ONE WILL EAT...\nIS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MAKING CHOICES, JUDGING AND DISCRIMINATING?\nManeesha, we are reaching to the second greatest Zen master, Joshu. Nothing can be compared with Bodhidharma, but if anyone else comes close to him, that is Joshu. But he just comes close, not to that height, not that Everest, but one cannot do anything about it.\nSome trees grow very high, some trees don’t. In the world of trees there is no comparison.\nIn the world of real consciousness, authentic realization, also there can be no comparison. But still one should not forget the highest, so that one does not become lost into the thousand and one great peaks.\nThe Himalayas are thousands of miles. Each peak is unique has to say something, has to reveal some beauty, some truth... stands on its own feet, not dependent, not imprisoned, with tremendous glory and splendor.\nOne can easily get lost and I would like you to remember the highest, because that should be your aim tooYour arrow should point to the highest.\nBefore I say something about Joshu, I would like to remind you of Bodhidharma’s sutras that we discussed yesterday. In just a very few words he has condensed the whole experience, the whole interiority, the whole kingdom of God: “Emptiness, nothing holy.” And when the emperor asked, “Then who is standing before me?” the answer was, “No knowing.”\nYesterday I forgot a very special point to be made to you that will give you the taste of real Zen. He said, “NO KNOWING.” He could have said, “Not knowing,” but he chose, “No knowing,” because “not knowing” implies the existence of I. No knowing does not imply; it simply states innocence. Not knowing is ignorance and no knowing is innocence.\nSuch is the clarity and depth of this man Bodhidharma. Even Socrates said, “I do not know anything.” Even he falls far below the heights of Bodhidharma. He accepts in his statement the existence of I; he accepts the existence of knowledge. He is simply saying, “I am ignorant.”\nJust a little difference, how small and how delicate: no knowing – not knowing. A small letter ‘t’ and worlds are set apart.\nIn these fourteen centuries that have followed Bodhidharma, hundreds of Zen masters of great clarity, insight, awakening, have happened, but no one even comes close to the depth, the subtlety, the beauty and the immense perception of Bodhidharma. As I look into Bodhidharma, I don’t find any other single individual in the whole history of mankind – even Gautam Buddha included – who can be said to have condensed religion into its simplest possibility, expressed religion into its absolute purity. It is obvious that this man is going to be misunderstood, condemned, ignored. The greatest peak of consciousness that man has achieved, mankind has not been kind enough to remember it. Perhaps there are heights our eyes cannot reach, but we should try our best; one never knows.\nJust a few days ago China discovered a higher peak of the Himalayas than Everest. For centuries Everest was the highest peak; it is no longer so. It is good that Edmund Hillary is dead; otherwise in his old age he would have suffered very much. He has enjoyed the great success of reaching to the highest peak of Everest. But fortunately before China’s discovery he was dead.\nIt is possible that some day someone may reach to a higher consciousness than Bodhidharma. It has not happened for fourteen centuries, but that does not mean it is absolutely decisive. I don’t see any difficulty, because the sky is infinite. Just a little more courage, a little more understanding, a little higher flight and you can reach to the joy that has been up to now only Bodhidharma’s.\nI would love my people to remember it, that there is no limitation, no boundaries, no hindrances – there are skies upon skies. As long as you want you can fly, you won’t touch the boundary of the universe. There is no such thing, no boundary line.\nIt has been very difficult for scientists to accept the idea that the universe is unbounded. Obviously it is difficult even to conceive of something that has no boundaries. One tends to think that somewhere, very far away, millions or trillions of light years away, but there must be a boundary! Mind can accept any boundary anywhere, but the reality is that by its very nature, existence cannot have any boundary, because what will be beyond the boundary? – again another sky. That’s why I am saying skies upon skies are available for your flight. Don’t be content easily. Those who remain content easily remain small: small are their joys, small are their ecstasies, small are their silences, small is their being.\nBut there is no need. This smallness is your own imposition upon your freedom, upon your unlimited possibilities, upon your unlimited potential.\nBodhidharma is a milestone, but the way goes farther, always farther. Joshu says: THE REAL WAY IS NOT DIFFICULT.\nOur minds say that spiritual growth is very difficult. Our religions make it as difficult as possible. According to them it takes many, many lives to reach to your own self – how ridiculous, how stupid! If I am to reach to myself... in fact I will tell Zen Master Niskriya to give a good Yaa-Hoo hit to Joshu.\nNiskriya...\n(NISKRIYA IS DRESSED UP AS A ZEN MONK. IT FITS HIM VERY WELL! – ESPECIALLY SINCE HE CUT HIS HAIR VERY SHORT A FEW DAYS BEFORE. HE IS HESITANT, WHAT TO DO.)\nGive it without any fear. (NISKRIYA GETS UP.)\nWhere is your staff?\n(HE PRODUCES A LONG WOODEN STAFF, TO EVERYBODY’S ASTONISHMENT.)\nRight! Have the staff. Good. Whom do you think to hit?\n(NISKRIYA HITS WITH THE STAFF ON HIS OWN HEAD! OSHO LAUGHS AND SIGNALS TO HIM TO SIT DOWN AGAIN.)\nGood.\nThe real way is not difficult, because there is no way. You are already where you have always been and will always be. What nonsense to talk about The Way! That’s why I said that, although Joshu is second in the hierarchy of Zen he has not that magic, that touch. That has been monopolized by Bodhidharma.\nEven to talk about the way is to make things difficult. I absolutely agree with Joshu that the way is very easy, but I cannot agree with his expression in the way I can agree with Bodhidharma, with absolute synchronicity, as if I have spoken those words myself: Emptiness, nothing holy, no knowing.\nWith Joshu I can only sympathize. I will not say he is wrong, but I will certainly say that the moment you start talking about the way, it becomes difficult. It becomes difficult because from here to here, there is no space for the way. If you are going somewhere else a way is possible – difficult or easy, it depends. But if you are not going anywhere, but simply being yourself, here and now...\nJoshu needs a good hit.\nBy chance today Master Niskriya is dressed up exactly, but Joshu is not here. But wherever Joshu is, and whoever the people are who believe in Joshu’s enlightenment, Master Niskriya’s hit will reach. I am using Master Niskriya’s hit because I am a very nonviolent person; moreover, so lazy that I have dedicated my whole function of hitting people to Master Niskriya. And he really looks... He is not only dressed up, at this moment he is. It is another matter that the next moment he may forget.\nThis moment you are also just emptiness. No knowing.\nPure innocence.\nBut to go on remembering it is the only problem. You don’t have to do anything, except to continue to remember that you are where you are, that you are what you are; that whatever you do, you can never be anywhere else, anybody else; that in this simple acceptance of your being, you have achieved all that has been achieved by the great buddhas.\nThere is no question of way; hence I can say that Joshu has a little understanding, but not much. He says, “The real way is not difficult.”\nJOSHU SPOKE TO THE ASSEMBLY AND SAID, “THE REAL WAY IS NOT DIFFICULT.\nIT ONLY ABHORS CHOICE AND ATTACHMENT.\nWITH BUT A SINGLE WORD THERE MAY ARISE CHOICE AND ATTACHMENT OR THERE MAY ARISE CLARITY.\nTHIS OLD MONK DOES NOT HAVE THAT CLARITY.\nDO YOU APPRECIATE THE MEANING OF THIS OR NOT?”\nIf you accept the basic assumption that there is a way – it is only a hypothesis – then Joshu is right that the only things that can prevent you from reaching it are judgment, choice, attachment.\n“WITH BUT A SINGLE WORD THERE MAY ARISE CHOICE AND ATTACHMENT OR THERE MAY\nARISE CLARITY. THIS OLD MONK...” He is referring to himself: THIS OLD MONK DOES NOT HAVE THAT CLARITY. Only on this point does he reach a height, accepting that THIS OLD MONK – he is not using the word ‘I’ – THIS OLD MONK DOES NOT HAVE THAT CLARITY. DO YOU APPRECIATE THE MEANING OF THIS OR NOT?\nHe is asking the assembly of the other monks.\nBefore I discuss the answers of other monks, I would like to repeat again that fundamentally Joshu is absurd. There is no way; hence, the question of its difficulty or easiness does not arise. Because there is no way, there is no question of choice, choicelessness, judgment or no judgment, clarity or cloudedness.\nSo remember – I was not in the assembly of Joshu, unfortunately, but time makes no difference. What I could not say in his assembly, I am saying in my own:\nThe way exists not. You are the very goal.\nNow have a look to the assembly of Joshu’s disciples...\nTHEN A MONK ASKED, “IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THAT CLARITY, WHAT DO YOU APPRECIATE?” JOSHU SAID,\n“I DO NOT KNOW THAT EITHER.”\nAgain remember Bodhidharma saying that standing before you is no knowing. He does not even by implication allow the existence of an ego. Joshu does not have that penetration. He is far closer to Socrates. He says, I DO NOT KNOW THAT EITHER. He accepts the existence of ‘I’ and he accepts the existence of ignorance. He misses the great peak of no knowing.\nTHE MONK SAID, “IF YOU DO NOT KNOW, HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE THAT CLARITY?”\nThese are tremendously beautiful dialogues. It is unfortunate that in our times there are no such assemblies; no such dialogues are happening, not even in our great universities. Everything has become so small, so mundane; everything has become so commercial.\nThe monk said to Joshu, IF YOU DO NOT KNOW, HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE\nTHAT CLARITY? At least you know this much: that you don’t have that clarity. The same would have been the situation of Socrates, but he was surrounded by very ordinary disciples. Joshu may not be right, but certainly he has great disciples.\nThe disciple is saying, “You say, I don’t have that clarity – at least you have accepted that you know SOMETHING. It is enough to show the contradiction.”\nJOSHU SAID, “ASKING THE QUESTION IS GOOD ENOUGH. NOW MAKE YOUR BOWS AND RETIRE.”\nNot a great statement... The monk, unknown, was far more clear than the master himself. And saying to the monk that, NOW MAKE YOUR BOWS AND RETIRE, freaks me out! Joshu should have touched his feet and asked for forgiveness. He did not prove his steel.\nNow again we have to listen to the schoolmaster Setcho: Setcho says, THE REAL WAY IS NOT DIFFICULT.\nThis is what is called parrot thinking. Now what is the point to repeat it? THE REAL WAY IS NOT DIFFICULT.\nDIRECT WORD! DIRECT SPEECH!\nNow this idiot does not understand a word and he is saying that what Joshu has said is: DIRECT WORD! DIRECT SPEECH!\nONE WITH MANY PHASES, TWO WITH ONE.\nFAR AWAY IN THE HEAVENS THE SUN RISES, THE MOON SETS; BEYOND THE HILLS THE HIGH MOUNTAINS, THE COLD WATERS. THE SKULL HAS NO CONSCIOUSNESS, NO DELIGHT;\nTHE DEAD TREE SINGS IN THE WIND, NOT YET ROTTEN. DIFFICULT, DIFFICULT!\nATTACHMENT AND CLARITY; WATCH, AND PENETRATE THE SECRET!\nThere is no secret. Joshu’s statement is simply without any reality in it, the question of any secret does not arise. But the schoolmaster tries to make it look as if there is some great secret. As a camouflage he writes some beautiful, poetic lines, but they have nothing to do with Joshu’s remark. They are simply an attempt to express, to exhibit that “I am a man of great understanding, I know the secret; now you penetrate...” And there is no secret at all.\nHe reminds me of an old proverb...\nIn ancient Greece, in the times of Anagoras... Anagoras was one of the great predecessors of Socrates, not a great philosopher, but he became great because people poisoned him also. I have never talked about him because there is nothing much about him, but still – by poisoning him, people have put him in the same category as Socrates and Jesus. Anagoras used to say – and from him comes the proverb – that a philosopher is a blind man in a dark night, in a dark house, searching for a black cat which is not there.\nQuestion 1\nManeesha, you are asking:\n“IN LIFE ONE CONTINUALLY HAS TO MAKE PRACTICAL DECISIONS – ABOUT HOW ONE WILL USE ONE’S TIME AND KEEP ENERGY, WITH WHOM ONE WILL KEEP COMPANY, WHAT ONE WILL EAT... IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MAKING CHOICES, JUDGING AND DISCRIMINATING?”\nIn ordinary life everything that you are doing is alright, but if you want to know the extraordinary livingness of your innermost core, then you will have to drop judgment, choice, discrimination. There is no need. In the inner world there is no marketplace, no shopping mall! In the inner world even you are not! Who is going to judge and what is going to be judged?\nAgain remember Bodhidharma:\nEmptiness, nothing holy, no knowing.\nI am not speaking on Bodhidharma, I am speaking of my own vision, which coincides with that of Bodhidharma.\nIt has been a serious evening with Joshu... You have enjoyed the silence. Now I would like to disturb your silence a little as a preparation for a greater silence.\nPope the Polack is wandering through the Vatican gardens one day, when he nearly steps on a toad. “Hey!” shouts the toad. “Don’t pass me by!”\n“What?” cries the startled pope.\n“I am a human being,” replies the toad, “who has been bewitched to look like a toad. Whoever saves me will have anything he wants.”\n“Well,” replies Pope the Polack, “I always wanted to be the most famous pope of all time!”\n“Simple!” says the toad. “You take me to your bed, let me sleep on your pillow, and in the morning you will have a wonderful surprise!”\nSo Pope the Polack puts the toad under his huge pointed hat and smuggles it into his bed.\nJust as the cardinal brings in the pope’s early morning tea, the toad changes into a beautiful princess... At least, this is the story the pope is giving to the newspapers.\nThe express train is crowded with businessmen on their way to the city.\nIn a first-class carriage, Mr. Wong is sitting reading the BEIJING TIMES, when a white-coated waiter comes along the passage with the breakfast trolley.\nHe stops by Mr. Wong, and says, “You for coffee?”\n“No,” snaps Wong, “I got first-class ticket. You fuck offee!” Miss Goodbody’s class goes for a picnic in the woods.\nAfter all the kids have drunk lots of lemonade, several of the girls retire to the bushes to pee and there is trouble with the brambles and the nettles.\nLittle Ernie walks in amongst them, pulls out his pecker and pees without any trouble. “Wow!” says little Sally, really impressed, “that’s a handy thing to bring on a picnic!”\nMrs. Benzini has been visiting her psychiatrist, Professor Potts, for years and feels that she is not getting any better. One day, she decides to confront the shrink. “Doctor,” she says, sitting up on the\ncouch, “I come-a every week for five years. Nothing change-a. What’s-a going on? You gotta tell me. What’s-a wrong with me?”\n“Well,” replies Potts, “I will be frank with you. You are crazy!”\n“What?” cries Mrs. Benzini. “Crazy? Crazy? I wanna second opinion!” “Okay,” says Potts, “you are ugly too!”\nNow close your eyes...\nBe absolutely still, as if frozen. Now, relax.\nNow, come back to life. Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3031","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/live_zen/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/live_zen/>Live Zen</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">2 From here to here - no space for the way</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3031 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Live_Zen/part2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

should point to the highest.</p><p><br></p><p>Before I say something about Joshu, I would like to remind you of
Bodhidharma’s sutras that we discussed yesterday. In just a very few
words he has condensed the whole experience, the whole interiority, the
whole kingdom of God: “Emptiness, nothing holy.” And when the emperor
asked, “Then who is standing before me?” the answer was, “No
knowing.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yesterday I forgot a very special point to be made to you that will
give you the taste of real Zen. He said, “NO KNOWING.” He could have
said, “Not knowing,” but he chose, “No knowing,” because “not knowing”
implies the existence of I. No knowing does not imply; it simply states
innocence. Not knowing is ignorance and no knowing is innocence.</p><p><br></p><p>Such is the clarity and depth of this man Bodhidharma. Even Socrates
said, “I do not know anything.” Even he falls far below the heights of
Bodhidharma. He accepts in his statement the existence of I; he accepts
the existence of knowledge. He is simply saying, “I am ignorant.”</p><p><br></p><p>Just a little difference, how small and how delicate: no knowing –
not knowing. A small letter ‘t’ and worlds are set apart.</p><p><br></p><p>In these fourteen centuries that have followed Bodhidharma, hundreds
of Zen masters of great clarity, insight, awakening, have happened, but
no one even comes close to the depth, the subtlety, the beauty and the
immense perception of Bodhidharma. As I look into Bodhidharma, I don’t
find any other single individual in the whole history of mankind – even
Gautam Buddha included – who can be said to have condensed religion into
its simplest possibility, expressed religion into its absolute purity.
It is obvious that this man is going to be misunderstood, condemned,
ignored. The greatest peak of consciousness that man has achieved,
mankind has not been kind enough to remember it. Perhaps there are
heights our eyes cannot reach, but we should try our best; one never
knows.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days ago China discovered a higher peak of the Himalayas
than Everest. For centuries Everest was the highest peak; it is no
longer so. It is good that Edmund Hillary is dead; otherwise in his old
age he would have suffered very much. He has enjoyed the great success
of reaching to the highest peak of Everest. But fortunately before
China’s discovery he was dead.</p><p><br></p><p>It is possible that some day someone may reach to a higher
consciousness than Bodhidharma. It has not happened for fourteen
centuries, but that does not mean it is absolutely decisive. I don’t see
any difficulty, because the sky is infinite. Just a little more courage,
a little more understanding, a little higher flight and you can reach to
the joy that has been up to now only Bodhidharma’s.</p><p><br></p><p>I would love my people to remember it, that there is no limitation,
no boundaries, no hindrances – there are skies upon skies. As long as
you want you can fly, you won’t touch the boundary of the universe.
There is no such thing, no boundary line.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been very difficult for scientists to accept the idea that the
universe is unbounded. Obviously it is difficult even to conceive of
something that has no boundaries. One tends to think that somewhere,
very far away, millions or trillions of light years away, but there must
be a boundary! Mind can accept any boundary anywhere, but the reality is
that by its very nature, existence cannot have any boundary, because
what will be beyond the boundary? – again another sky. That’s why I am
saying skies upon skies are available for your flight. Don’t be content
easily. Those who remain content easily remain small: small are their
joys, small are their ecstasies, small are their silences, small is
their being.</p><p><br></p><p>But there is no need. This smallness is your own imposition upon your
freedom, upon your unlimited possibilities, upon your unlimited
potential.</p><p><br></p><p>Bodhidharma is a milestone, but the way goes farther, always farther.
Joshu says: THE REAL WAY IS NOT DIFFICULT.</p><p>Our minds say that spiritual growth is very difficult. Our religions
make it as difficult as possible. According to them it takes many, many
lives to reach to your own self – how ridiculous, how stupid! If I am to
reach to myself... in fact I will tell Zen Master Niskriya to give a
good Yaa-Hoo hit to Joshu.</p><p><br></p><p>Niskriya...</p><p><br></p><p>(NISKRIYA IS DRESSED UP AS A ZEN MONK. IT FITS HIM VERY WELL! –
ESPECIALLY SINCE HE CUT HIS HAIR VERY SHORT A FEW DAYS BEFORE. HE IS
HESITANT, WHAT TO DO.)</p><p><br></p><p>Give it without any fear. (NISKRIYA GETS UP.)</p><p>Where is your staff?</p><p><br></p><p>(HE PRODUCES A LONG WOODEN STAFF, TO EVERYBODY’S ASTONISHMENT.)</p><p><br></p><p>Right! Have the staff. Good. Whom do you think to hit?</p><p>(NISKRIYA HITS WITH THE STAFF ON HIS OWN HEAD! OSHO LAUGHS AND
SIGNALS TO HIM TO SIT DOWN AGAIN.)</p><p><br></p><p>Good.</p><p><br></p><p>The real way is not difficult, because there is no way. You are
already where you have always been and will always be. What nonsense to
talk about The Way! That’s why I said that, although Joshu is second in
the hierarchy of Zen he has not that magic, that touch. That has been
monopolized by Bodhidharma.</p><p><br></p><p>Even to talk about the way is to make things difficult. I absolutely
agree with Joshu that the way is very easy, but I cannot agree with his
expression in the way I can agree with Bodhidharma, with absolute
synchronicity, as if I have spoken those words myself: Emptiness,
nothing holy, no knowing.</p><p><br></p><p>With Joshu I can only sympathize. I will not say he is wrong, but I
will certainly say that the moment you start talking about the way, it
becomes difficult. It becomes difficult because from here to here, there
is no space for the way. If you are going somewhere else a way is
possible – difficult or easy, it depends. But if you are not going
anywhere, but simply being yourself, here and now...</p><p><br></p><p>Joshu needs a good hit.</p><p><br></p><p>By chance today Master Niskriya is dressed up exactly, but Joshu is
not here. But wherever Joshu is, and whoever the people are who believe
in Joshu’s enlightenment, Master Niskriya’s hit will reach. I am using
Master Niskriya’s hit because I am a very nonviolent person; moreover,
so lazy that I have dedicated my whole function of hitting people to
Master Niskriya. And he really looks... He is not only dressed up, at
this moment he is. It is another matter that the next moment he may
forget.</p><p><br></p><p>This moment you are also just emptiness. No knowing.</p><p>Pure innocence.</p><p><br></p><p>But to go on remembering it is the only problem. You don’t have to do
anything, except to continue to remember that you are where you are,
that you are what you are; that whatever you do, you can never be
anywhere else, anybody else; that in this simple acceptance of your
being, you have achieved all that has been achieved by the great
buddhas.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no question of way; hence I can say that Joshu has a little
understanding, but not much. He says, “The real way is not
difficult.”</p><p><br></p><p>JOSHU SPOKE TO THE ASSEMBLY AND SAID, “THE REAL WAY IS NOT
DIFFICULT.</p><p>IT ONLY ABHORS CHOICE AND ATTACHMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>WITH BUT A SINGLE WORD THERE MAY ARISE CHOICE AND ATTACHMENT OR THERE
MAY ARISE CLARITY.</p><p><br></p><p>THIS OLD MONK DOES NOT HAVE THAT CLARITY.</p><p><br></p><p>DO YOU APPRECIATE THE MEANING OF THIS OR NOT?”</p><p><br></p><p>If you accept the basic assumption that there is a way – it is only a
hypothesis – then Joshu is right that the only things that can prevent
you from reaching it are judgment, choice, attachment.</p><p><br></p><p>“WITH BUT A SINGLE WORD THERE MAY ARISE CHOICE AND ATTACHMENT OR
THERE MAY</p><p>ARISE CLARITY. THIS OLD MONK...” He is referring to himself: THIS OLD
MONK DOES NOT HAVE THAT CLARITY. Only on this point does he reach a
height, accepting that THIS OLD MONK – he is not using the word ‘I’ –
THIS OLD MONK DOES NOT HAVE THAT CLARITY. DO YOU APPRECIATE THE MEANING
OF THIS OR NOT?</p><p><br></p><p>He is asking the assembly of the other monks.</p><p><br></p><p>Before I discuss the answers of other monks, I would like to repeat
again that fundamentally Joshu is absurd. There is no way; hence, the
question of its difficulty or easiness does not arise. Because there is
no way, there is no question of choice, choicelessness, judgment or no
judgment, clarity or cloudedness.</p><p><br></p><p>So remember – I was not in the assembly of Joshu, unfortunately, but
time makes no difference. What I could not say in his assembly, I am
saying in my own:</p><p><br></p><p>The way exists not. You are the very goal.</p><p><br></p><p>Now have a look to the assembly of Joshu’s disciples...</p><p><br></p><p>THEN A MONK ASKED, “IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THAT CLARITY, WHAT DO YOU
APPRECIATE?” JOSHU SAID,</p><p><br></p><p>“I DO NOT KNOW THAT EITHER.”</p><p><br></p><p>Again remember Bodhidharma saying that standing before you is no
knowing. He does not even by implication allow the existence of an ego.
Joshu does not have that penetration. He is far closer to Socrates. He
says, I DO NOT KNOW THAT EITHER. He accepts the existence of ‘I’ and he
accepts the existence of ignorance. He misses the great peak of no
knowing.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK SAID, “IF YOU DO NOT KNOW, HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT YOU DO NOT
HAVE THAT CLARITY?”</p><p><br></p><p>These are tremendously beautiful dialogues. It is unfortunate that in
our times there are no such assemblies; no such dialogues are happening,
not even in our great universities. Everything has become so small, so
mundane; everything has become so commercial.</p><p><br></p><p>The monk said to Joshu, IF YOU DO NOT KNOW, HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT YOU
DO NOT HAVE</p><p>THAT CLARITY? At least you know this much: that you don’t have that
clarity. The same would have been the situation of Socrates, but he was
surrounded by very ordinary disciples. Joshu may not be right, but
certainly he has great disciples.</p><p><br></p><p>The disciple is saying, “You say, I don’t have that clarity – at
least you have accepted that you know SOMETHING. It is enough to show
the contradiction.”</p><p><br></p><p>JOSHU SAID, “ASKING THE QUESTION IS GOOD ENOUGH. NOW MAKE YOUR BOWS
AND RETIRE.”</p><p><br></p><p>Not a great statement... The monk, unknown, was far more clear than
the master himself. And saying to the monk that, NOW MAKE YOUR BOWS AND
RETIRE, freaks me out! Joshu should have touched his feet and asked for
forgiveness. He did not prove his steel.</p><p><br></p><p>Now again we have to listen to the schoolmaster Setcho: Setcho says,
THE REAL WAY IS NOT DIFFICULT.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what is called parrot thinking. Now what is the point to
repeat it? THE REAL WAY IS NOT DIFFICULT.</p><p>DIRECT WORD! DIRECT SPEECH!</p><p><br></p><p>Now this idiot does not understand a word and he is saying that what
Joshu has said is: DIRECT WORD! DIRECT SPEECH!</p><p>ONE WITH MANY PHASES, TWO WITH ONE.</p><p>FAR AWAY IN THE HEAVENS THE SUN RISES, THE MOON SETS; BEYOND THE
HILLS THE HIGH MOUNTAINS, THE COLD WATERS. THE SKULL HAS NO
CONSCIOUSNESS, NO DELIGHT;</p><p>THE DEAD TREE SINGS IN THE WIND, NOT YET ROTTEN. DIFFICULT,
DIFFICULT!</p><p>ATTACHMENT AND CLARITY; WATCH, AND PENETRATE THE SECRET!</p><p><br></p><p>There is no secret. Joshu’s statement is simply without any reality
in it, the question of any secret does not arise. But the schoolmaster
tries to make it look as if there is some great secret. As a camouflage
he writes some beautiful, poetic lines, but they have nothing to do with
Joshu’s remark. They are simply an attempt to express, to exhibit that
“I am a man of great understanding, I know the secret; now you
penetrate...” And there is no secret at all.</p><p><br></p><p>He reminds me of an old proverb...</p><p><br></p><p>In ancient Greece, in the times of Anagoras... Anagoras was one of
the great predecessors of Socrates, not a great philosopher, but he
became great because people poisoned him also. I have never talked about
him because there is nothing much about him, but still – by poisoning
him, people have put him in the same category as Socrates and Jesus.
Anagoras used to say – and from him comes the proverb – that a
philosopher is a blind man in a dark night, in a dark house, searching
for a black cat which is not there.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, you are asking:</p><p><br></p><p>“IN LIFE ONE CONTINUALLY HAS TO MAKE PRACTICAL DECISIONS – ABOUT HOW
ONE WILL USE ONE’S TIME AND KEEP ENERGY, WITH WHOM ONE WILL KEEP
COMPANY, WHAT ONE WILL EAT... IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MAKING
CHOICES, JUDGING AND DISCRIMINATING?”</p><p><br></p><p>In ordinary life everything that you are doing is alright, but if you
want to know the extraordinary livingness of your innermost core, then
you will have to drop judgment, choice, discrimination. There is no
need. In the inner world there is no marketplace, no shopping mall! In
the inner world even you are not! Who is going to judge and what is
going to be judged?</p><p><br></p><p>Again remember Bodhidharma:</p><p><br></p><p>Emptiness, nothing holy, no knowing.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not speaking on Bodhidharma, I am speaking of my own vision,
which coincides with that of Bodhidharma.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been a serious evening with Joshu... You have enjoyed the
silence. Now I would like to disturb your silence a little as a
preparation for a greater silence.</p><p><br></p><p>Pope the Polack is wandering through the Vatican gardens one day,
when he nearly steps on a toad. “Hey!” shouts the toad. “Don’t pass me
by!”</p><p>“What?” cries the startled pope.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am a human being,” replies the toad, “who has been bewitched to
look like a toad. Whoever saves me will have anything he wants.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” replies Pope the Polack, “I always wanted to be the most
famous pope of all time!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Simple!” says the toad. “You take me to your bed, let me sleep on
your pillow, and in the morning you will have a wonderful surprise!”</p><p><br></p><p>So Pope the Polack puts the toad under his huge pointed hat and
smuggles it into his bed.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as the cardinal brings in the pope’s early morning tea, the toad
changes into a beautiful princess... At least, this is the story the
pope is giving to the newspapers.</p><p><br></p><p>The express train is crowded with businessmen on their way to the
city.</p><p><br></p><p>In a first-class carriage, Mr. Wong is sitting reading the BEIJING
TIMES, when a white-coated waiter comes along the passage with the

Goodbody’s class goes for a picnic in the woods.</p><p>After all the kids have drunk lots of lemonade, several of the girls

a handy thing to bring on a picnic!”</p><p>Mrs. Benzini has been visiting her psychiatrist, Professor Potts, for
years and feels that she is not getting any better. One day, she decides
to confront the shrink. “Doctor,” she says, sitting up on the</p><p><br></p><p>couch, “I come-a every week for five years. Nothing change-a.
What’s-a going on? You gotta tell me. What’s-a wrong with me?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” replies Potts, “I will be frank with you. You are crazy!”</p><p><br></p><p>“What?” cries Mrs. Benzini. “Crazy? Crazy? I wanna second opinion!”
“Okay,” says Potts, “you are ugly too!”</p><p>Now close your eyes...</p><p><br></p><p>Be absolutely still, as if frozen. Now, relax.</p><p>Now, come back to life. Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

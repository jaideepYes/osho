TOZAN VISITED ISAN, WHO RECOMMENDED THAT HE GO TO SEE UNGAN.\nWITH UNGAN, TOZAN WAS FIRST MADE AWARE OF THE TRUTH, AND HE COMPOSED THE FOLLOWING GATHA TO RECORD HIS EXPERIENCE:\n“HOW WONDERFUL! HOW WONDERFUL!\nTHE INANIMATE EXPOUNDING THE DHARMA – WHAT AN INEFFABLE TRUTH!\nIF YOU TRY TO HEAR IT WITH YOUR EARS, YOU WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND IT.\nONLY WHEN YOU HEAR IT THROUGH THE EYE, WILL YOU REALLY KNOW IT.”\nUNGAN ASKED HIM, “ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?”\nTOZAN ANSWERED, “I DO NOT SAY THAT I AM NOT HAPPY, BUT MY HAPPINESS IS LIKE THAT OF SOMEONE WHO HAS PICKED UP A BRIGHT PEARL FROM A HEAP OF GARBAGE.”\nFOR A WHILE AFTER HIS ENLIGHTENMENT, TOZAN CONTINUED TO TRAVEL AROUND CHINA. ONE DAY HE ARRIVED AT LEH T’AN AND MET THE HEAD MONK, CH’U. CH’U GREETED TOZAN AND SAID:\n“WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL –\nTHE INCONCEIVABLE REALMS OF TAO AND BUDDHA!”\nTOZAN RESPONDED, “I DON’T KNOW ABOUT THESE REALMS. WHO IS TALKING OF THEM?” CH’U REMAINED SILENT, AND TOZAN SHOUTED, “SPEAK!”\nCH’U THEN SAID, “NO NEED TO FIGHT ABOUT IT. THAT IS THE WAY TO MISS.”\nTOZAN REPLIED, “IF IT HAS NOT BEEN MENTIONED, HOW CAN THERE BE FIGHTING AND MISSING?”\nCH’U COULD MAKE NO ANSWER TO THIS.\nTOZAN THEN SAID, “BUDDHA AND TAO – NEXT YOU WILL TALK OF SUTRAS.” CH’U REPLIED, “WHAT DO THE SUTRAS SAY ABOUT THIS?”\nTOZAN RESPONDED, “WHEN ALL IS UNDERSTOOD, WORDS ARE FORGOTTEN.” CH’U SAID, “THIS IS SICKNESS OF THE MIND.”\nTOZAN SAID, “IS THIS SICKNESS SLIGHT OR SEVERE?” CH’U COULD MAKE NO REPLY TO TOZAN.\nFriends,\nBefore the sutras there are a few questions from the sannyasins. Question 1\nThe first question:\nGESTA ITAL, A FORMER FAMOUS GERMAN ACTRESS, WAS THE FIRST WESTERN WOMAN WHO WAS ALLOWED TO ENTER IN A ZEN MONASTERY IN JAPAN AND TO WORK WITH AN ENLIGHTENED MASTER.\nSHE WROTE TWO BOOKS ABOUT HER PATH AND HER EXPERIENCE OF ENLIGHTENMENT. WHEN I READ THESE BOOKS I HAD THE IMPRESSION OF A VERY HARD AND LONELY\nPATH. BEING WITH YOU IS MUCH MORE JOYFUL AND PLAYFUL. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS DIFFERENCE?\nThe traditional Zen is hard. It takes twenty to thirty years of constant meditation, withdrawing from everywhere all your energy and devoting it only to meditation.\nThat tradition comes from Gautam Buddha himself. He had to find his enlightenment after twelve years of hard work.\nI am changing it completely from the traditional Zen, because I don’t see that the contemporary man can devote twenty or thirty years to meditation only. If Zen remains that hard, it will disappear from the world. It has already disappeared from China, it is disappearing from Japan, and it disappeared from India long ago. It remained in India for only five hundred years after Gautam Buddha. In the sixth century it reached China, remained there for only a few centuries, and moved to Japan. And now it is almost extinct from both China and Japan.\nYou will be surprised to know that my books are being taught in the Zen monasteries. Zen masters have written letters to me: “Perhaps now Zen will exist in India, in its original place. It is disappearing from Japan because people are more interested in technology, in science.”\nThat is the situation in India too. Very few people are interested in the inner exploration. Here you can find a few people from every country, but these are so few compared to the five billion human beings on the earth. Ten thousand is not a great number.\nZen has to be transformed in a way that the contemporary man can be interested in it. It has to be easy, relaxed, it has not to be hard. That old traditional type is no longer possible, nor is it needed. Once it has been explored, once a single man has become enlightened, the path becomes easy. You don’t have to discover electricity again and again. Once discovered you start using it – you don’t have to be great scientists.\nThe man who discovered electricity worked on it for almost twenty years. Three hundred disciples started with him and nobody remained because it took so long; everybody became exhausted. But the original scientist continued. His explanation to his own disciples was, “The more we are failing in finding the root of electricity, the closer we are going to the very root. Every failure is bringing us closer to the discovery.”\nAnd finally, one night in the darkness, suddenly the first electric bulb started radiating. And you cannot conceive the joy of the man who had been working for thirty years. His silence... he was in awe. He could not believe his own eyes that after all this time it had happened, electricity had been controlled – “Now in our hands, how to use it?”\nHis wife called to him, “Come inside the bedroom, it is the middle of the night. Put the light out!”\nShe was not aware that it was no ordinary light, and that the scientist had called her – “Come here and be the first to see something original. You will be the first person I will introduce to the secrets of electricity.”\nNow, you don’t have to work for thirty years to know about electricity. Nor do you have to work thirty years for the Zen experience.\nThe awakening of the buddha is a very easy and relaxed phenomenon. Now that so many people have awakened, the path has become clear-cut; it is no longer hard and arduous. You can playfully enter inside and joyously experience the awakening of awareness. It is not as far away as it was for Gautam Buddha.\nFor Gautam Buddha it was an absolute unknown. He was searching for it like a blind man, knowing nothing about where he was going. But he was a man of tremendous courage, who for twelve years went on searching, exploring every method available in his time... all the teachers who were talking about philosophy and yoga. He went from one teacher to another, and every teacher finally said to him, “I can tell you only this much. More than this I don’t know myself.”\nFinally, he remained alone, and he dropped all yoga disciplines. He had his own five disciples, who thought that he was a great ascetic. But when they saw that he had dropped all yoga discipline, and he was no longer fasting, they dropped him. All those five disciples left him – “He has fallen from his greatness; he is no longer a saint; he has become ordinary.”\nBut in that ordinariness, when he had dropped everything – just being tired and exhausted – that fullmoon night when the five disciples left him, he slept under the bodhi tree, completely free from this world and completely free from the very search for that world. For the first time he was utterly relaxed: no desire to find anything, no desire to become anything. And in that moment of non- desiring, he suddenly awakened and became a buddha. Buddhahood came to him in a relaxed state.\nYou don’t have to work for twelve years, you can just start from the relaxed state. It was the last point in Gautam Buddha’s journey. It can be the first point in your journey.\nAnd the first thing Gautam Buddha did after he became awakened was to go in search of those five disciples to share what had happened to him. And when he reached those five disciples... they saw him coming – it is a very beautiful story.\nThey decided, “Gautama is coming, but we are not going to pay any respect to him. He has stopped being a holy man; he has started living a relaxed and comfortable life.”\nBut as Buddha came closer, all the five disciples stood up. Although they had decided not to pay him any respect, in spite of their decision, they could see that Gautama had changed completely – “He is no more the same person we used to know. He is coming with such a silence, with such contentment. It seems he has found it.” And they all touched Gautam Buddha’s feet.\nAnd Gautam Buddha’s first statement to them was, “When you had decided not to pay attention to me, why are you paying such respect?”\nAll those five asked to be forgiven. They said, “We were thinking you were the same old Gautama. We used to know you – for five years we have been together, but you are not the same person anymore.”\nEnlightenment is such a transformation that you are a totally different person. The old person dies away, and a totally new awareness, a fresh bliss, a flowering, a spring which has never been there...\nIt took twelve years for Gautam Buddha. It need not take even twelve minutes for you. It is simply an art, to relax into yourself. In the traditional Zen they are still doing whatever Buddha did in his ignorance, and finally they drop it.\nI am telling you, why not drop it right now? You can relax this very moment!\nAnd in that relaxation you will find the light, the awareness, the awakening.\nWhat has happened to Gesta Ital, is not necessarily an introduction to Zen. She has been in the company of old and traditional Zen masters. I understand Zen to be a very simple, innocent, joyful method. There is nothing ascetic in it, nothing life-negative – no need to renounce the world, no need to become a monk, no need to enter a monastery. You have to enter into yourself. That can be done anywhere.\nWe are doing it in the simplest way possible. And only if Zen becomes as simple as I am trying to make it, can the contemporary man be interested in it. Otherwise he has so much to do – so many things to do, so many paths to explore, so many things to distract him.\nZen has to become such a small playful thing, that while you are going to sleep – just before that – within five minutes you can enter into yourself, and you can remain at the very center of your being the whole night. Your whole night can become a peaceful, silent awareness. Sleep will be in the body, but underneath it there will be a current of light from the evening till the morning.\nAnd once you know that even in sleep a certain awareness can be present inside you, then the whole day, doing all kinds of things, you can remain alert, conscious. Buddhahood has to be a very normal, ordinary, simple and human affair.\nQuestion 2\nThe second question:\nI CANNOT PUT IT INTO WORDS HOW MUCH I AM ALWAYS TOUCHED BY THE BEAUTY OF YOUR EXPRESSIONS – IN YOUR WORDS, YOUR GESTURES AND NOW ESPECIALLY IN YOUR PAINTINGS.\nWHAT EXACTLY HAPPENS, WHEN YOU ARE SITTING IN FRONT OF AN EMPTY PAPER? IS THERE STILL AN URGE FOR ARTISTIC CREATIVITY WHEN ONE IS ENLIGHTENED? COULD YOU PLEASE TELL US ABOUT ZEN AND ART AND CREATIVITY?\nZen prevents you from nothing. It opens everything that is potential in you. If you have a potentiality of being a painter, Zen will open it – you may not have been aware of it. If there is a potentiality\nfor poetry, Zen will open that potentiality, and for the first time you will start thinking in poetry, not in prose.\nThe same is true about music or dance, or scientific exploration. Any kind of original experiences, Zen allows you. It is not preventive of anything. It is affirmative, the most affirmative experience in life. It simply makes you aware of all that is hidden in you, of all that you have never looked at. It not only makes you aware, it helps you to explore that potentiality.\nZen is not a dry, desertlike experience, it is very juicy, a beautiful garden – a spring in your life where flowers suddenly start opening up. One never knows what is going to happen to him when he becomes aware. It is not a decision on your part, it is not a choice. It is a choiceless, simple experience – you start moving into a certain direction. Suddenly that direction becomes so full of life, so attractive that you can devote everything to it.\nZen is a very creative experience; it is not like other religions. All the religions are non-creative. In fact, the so-called saints don’t do anything. They are not great poets, they are not great dancers, they are not great musicians. But the real and authentic saints, who are very few among the so-called saints...\nJust the other day I received the information that this pope in his four years of office has made more than two thousand people saints. It is a certificate. He goes on giving certificates to all kinds of people who can donate money. Now the Catholic church owns the biggest bank in the world – the Bank of America. The Catholic church owns the greatest amount of land in the world – more than any other country.\nThe method in the past has been war, killing people. Thousands of people have been killed just to take possession of their properties, or they have been forced to become Catholics. A single Catholic emperor, Constantine, killed ten thousand people in a single day. He just called an assembly of all those who were not Catholics in a great auditorium in Rome, and ordered the army to shoot everybody: “We don’t want anybody other than Christians in Rome.” He forced the whole of Italy to become Christian... just at the point of the gun.\nThe whole history of Christianity is of wars and nothing else – killing and violence. And the same is true about the other religions in a lesser measure; they are destructive. They are destructive in many ways. They destroy people by creating guilt, by making them sinners, by forcing them to renounce the world and all that is pleasant, and to go into hardships unnecessarily. But those who go into hardships are respected and their hardship has nothing to contribute to the world, only sickness, only guilt. All your saints are together enforcing guilt in you.\nSo in this way they destroy humanity, and in other ways they kill people because they don’t belong to their fold. They force people – either by the sword, or with bread. In the past they used to come with a sword, now they come with bread. The poor have been always vulnerable to being converted, either by force or by bribery. But this is not religiousness at all, this is pure politics.\nZen is an authentic religious experience. Its authenticity is in its opening of creativeness in human beings. Zen masters have never killed anyone. They have not forced anyone to their path; on the contrary, you have to go to them. And it has been very difficult to be accepted; the masters have\nbeen very choosy. Unless you show an immense desire and longing, they will not initiate you; the question of conversion does not arise.\nYou have to go to the well, the well does not come to you. The well does not even invite you, it is simply there, available.\nQuestion 3\nThe third question:\nWHEN ENERGY GOES INWARD IT TURNS INTO THOUGHTS, FEELINGS, EMOTIONS, AND WHEN ENERGY GOES OUTWARD IT TURNS INTO RELATIONSHIPS WITH BEINGS AND NATURE. BUT WHEN ENERGY DOES NOT MOVE INWARD OR OUTWARD, IT IS JUST THERE PULSATING, VIBRATING. THEN IT IS ONE WITH THE EXISTENCE, ONE WITH THE WHOLE. IS THIS ZAZEN?\nExactly. When the energy is just there – not going anywhere, just pulsating at the original source, just radiating its light there, blossoming like a lotus, neither going out nor going in – it is simply here and now.\nWhen I say go inward, I am simply saying don’t go on moving in the head.\nThe whole society forces your energy to move in the head. All education consists of the basic technique of how to pulsate the energy only in the head – how to make you a great mathematician, how to make you a great physician. All the education in the world consists of taking the energy into the head.\nZen asks you to come out of the head and go to the basic source – from where the educational system around the world has been taking the energy, putting it into the head, and turning it into thoughts, images, and creating thinking. It has its uses. It is not that Zen is not aware of the uses of energy in the head, but if all the energy is used in the head, you will never become aware of your eternity. You may become a very great thinker and philosopher, but you will never know, as an experience, what life is. You will never know as an experience, what it is to be one with the whole.\nWhen the energy is just at the center, pulsating... When it is not moving anywhere, neither in the head nor in the heart, but it is at the very source from where the heart takes it, the head takes it... pulsating at the very source – that is the very meaning of Zazen.\nZazen means just sitting at the very source, not moving anywhere. A tremendous force arises, a transformation of energy into light and love, into greater life, into compassion, into creativity. It can take many forms, but first you have to learn how to be at the source. Then the source will decide where your potential is. You can relax at the source, and it will take you to your very potential. It does not mean that you have to stop thinking forever, it simply means you should be aware and alert and capable of moving into the source. When you need the head you can move the energy into the head, and when you need to love, you can move the energy into the heart.\nBut you need not think twenty-four hours. When you are not thinking you have to relax back into your center – that keeps the Zen man constantly content, alert, joyful. A blissfulness surrounds him; it is not an act, it is simply radiation.\nZazen is the strategy of Zen. Literally it means just sitting. Sitting where? Sitting at the very source. And once in a while, if you go on sitting in the source, you can manage all mental activities without any disturbance, you can manage all heart activities without any difficulty. And still, whenever you have time, you need not unnecessarily think, you need not unnecessarily feel, you can just be.\nJust being is Zazen.\nAnd if you can just be – only for a few minutes in twenty-four hours – that is enough to keep you alert of your buddhahood.\nBefore the sutras, a little biographical note.\nTOZAN RYOKAI, A DISCIPLE OF UNGAN, WAS BORN IN CHINA IN 807, AND DIED IN 869. HE ORIGINALLY WAS A MEMBER OF THE VINAYA SECT, BUT LATER BECAME INTERESTED IN ZEN AND SET OUT ON A JOURNEY TO FIND A MASTER.\nThe Vinaya sect is the Buddhist name of the people who are interested in the scriptures, in the words of the masters in a philosophical and scholarly way. They are mentally active, but they are not moving into the experience themselves. They gather as much knowledge as possible, they become very wise. They know all the answers that are in the sutras, but they don’t have a single experience of their own.\nTozan was first a scholar, studying all the literature – and Buddhism has the greatest literature in the world. Compared to any other religion it has more scriptures.\nJust as Gautam Buddha died, his disciples became separated into thirty-two branches. Immediately there were thirty-two branches of scholarship, of different scriptures and sutras, pretending to be authentic, pretending to be the only true ones. The problem was that for forty-two years Gautam Buddha was teaching, morning and evening – a few people heard a few things, a few people heard a few other things.\nIn forty-two years he was constantly moving from one place to another place. Obviously there were different people who had heard different things from him, and they compiled sutras. Immediately thirty-two branches started. Gautam Buddha had not written a single word, but every branch pretended to be the authentic one – “this is what Buddha said...”\nIt is very difficult now to find out what actually was said by Gautam Buddha, and what was added by the disciples. So there is a great scholarship in the Buddhist world where people search into scriptures trying to find what is authentic and what is not.\nJust recently, the same kind of scholarship has started in Europe. The professors and the very scholarly Christians have formed a special committee, the Biblical Scholars. And they are now searching for what exactly was said by Jesus, and what has been added by others – what is fiction, what is myth, what is truth.\nJust a few days ago, Pope the Polack declared to all the Catholics of the world: “Don’t listen to the Biblical Scholars” – because the Biblical Scholars are taking out many things which have been\nadded to the Bible which are not true. Events, miracles, the virgin birth, the resurrection... the Biblical Scholars are taking all those things out. It is agreed that they are the most scholarly group in Europe concerning the Bible.\nThey meet every few months, and they discuss papers. And if you listen to them, almost ninety percent of the Bible disappears. And they are absolutely right, because for the first time they are searching at the roots from where this saying, this statement, this gospel, has come. A few are found to be in the ancient scriptures of the pagans, and those scriptures have been destroyed so that nobody can prove that Jesus ever said these things.\nEven the idea of the virgin birth is more ancient than Jesus. It was a pagan god, a Roman god who was thought to be born from a virgin, and to the same god, the crucifixion happened. And to the same god is connected the idea of the resurrection. All that has been taken and compiled into the Bible. The pagans have been destroyed, their temples have been burned, their scriptures have been destroyed. Now these Biblical Scholars are trying to find ways and methods to uncover the facts from contemporary literature about when Jesus was alive.\nOne of the gospels was written in India – the fifth gospel of Thomas. It has not been included in the Bible, for the simple reason that it was not available to Constantine, who was compiling, and who was deciding what was to be included and what was not to be included. It was because of him that all these ideas and mythologies and fictions have been added to the life of Jesus.\nThe same is true about Buddhist literature: much is borrowed from Hindu literature; much is borrowed from Jaina literature, because these were contemporaries. And a few contemporaries of Buddha have left no literature behind, but they were also teaching in the places where Buddha was teaching, so many of their teachings have been compiled and mixed with Gautam Buddha’s.\nA very scholarly tradition exists in Zen to find out the original teachings of Buddha. But even if you can find what is the original statement and what is not, that does not mean you can become enlightened. You may know exactly what Buddha said, but that will not make any difference to your consciousness.\nTozan was first a scholar, and found that however you go on trying to know and find the original sources, you still remain ignorant. You become a great knower, but deep down you know nothing about yourself. And the question is not to know what Buddha said, the question is to know your own inner buddha, your own inner consciousness.\nAfter being in the scholarly Vinaya sect, he became interested in Zen. He dropped out of the scholarly world and set out on a journey to find a master. He had been with teachers, great scholars, but none of them was a master.\nAnd a master need not be a scholar – it is not a necessity. He may be a scholar – that is accidental. What is necessary and existential is his own knowing, his own experience.\nSo he went in search of a man who himself knows what is the truth, and who can tell him the way to it.\nThe sutra:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nTOZAN HAD A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER INANIMATE OBJECTS EXPOUND THE DHARMA. TOZAN VISITED ISAN, WHO RECOMMENDED THAT HE GO TO SEE UNGAN.\nHis inquiry was whether inanimate objects in the world expound the dharma, the ultimate truth – whether you can find in the objective world the ultimate truth.\nThat’s what science is trying to do – trying to find the ultimate truth in objects. You cannot find it in objects. But this is part of the Zen tradition, that also...\nIsan was himself a master, but he recommended Tozan to go to see Ungan, seeing that Tozan was a scholar. Isan was not a scholar – he was a master, he knew his own buddhahood. But seeing that this man Tozan was bound to ask philosophical questions, he sent him to Ungan, who was a master and a scholar.\nWITH UNGAN, TOZAN WAS FIRST MADE AWARE OF THE TRUTH, AND HE COMPOSED THE FOLLOWING gatha TO RECORD HIS EXPERIENCE:\n“HOW WONDERFUL! HOW WONDERFUL!\nTHE INANIMATE EXPOUNDING THE DHARMA – WHAT AN INEFFABLE TRUTH!”\nUngan told him to be in silence. And as you become silent, everything around you starts expounding the truth: the trees and the mountains... all the objects become suddenly aflame, afire with truth. If you are sitting silently in your own source of being, then everything in the world indicates towards the ultimate.\nWhen he found his source he wrote this gatha:\n“HOW WONDERFUL! HOW WONDERFUL!\nTHE INANIMATE EXPOUNDING THE DHARMA – WHAT AN INEFFABLE TRUTH!\nIF YOU TRY TO HEAR IT WITH YOUR EARS, YOU WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND IT. ONLY WHEN YOU HEAR IT THROUGH THE EYE,\nWILL YOU REALLY KNOW IT.”\nHe is talking about the third eye. As you go inwards... your energy is in the head. First it has to pass the third eye. Going deeper it will pass through the heart, the fourth center – and the whole energy is at the first center. From there it can rise back to the seventh center in the head.\nBut if you remain hung up in the seventh center only, you will never know as an experience what is truth. You have to come down to the depths, to the valleys of your being. You have to reach to the very roots from where you are joined with the whole.\nUNGAN ASKED HIM, “ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?”\nTOZAN ANSWERED, “I DO NOT SAY THAT I AM NOT HAPPY, BUT MY HAPPINESS IS LIKE THAT OF SOMEONE WHO HAS PICKED UP A BRIGHT PEARL FROM A HEAP OF GARBAGE.”\nFOR A WHILE AFTER HIS ENLIGHTENMENT, TOZAN CONTINUED TO TRAVEL AROUND CHINA.\nHe is saying that unless you see it yourself, there is no other way to know it. You cannot hear it from somebody else. No buddha can preach it to you, no master can teach it to you. They all can only make gestures. They all can only indicate their finger towards the moon, but the finger is not the moon. You have to drop looking at the finger, and to start looking at the moon. When you look at the moon yourself, you know the beauty of it. You cannot know that beauty by looking at the finger pointing to the moon.\nAll knowledge is pointing to the moon. All sutras, all scriptures are pointing to the moon – just fingers. And people are clinging to the fingers, they have completely forgotten that the fingers are not the point. The moon is far away, the finger is only pointing towards it. Don’t cling to the finger; forget the finger. Forget all knowledge, all scriptures, and look at your truth yourself.\nIt is not a question of your ears, it is a question of your very eye, your inner eye. Unless you look inside... you cannot know it by hearing, or by reading. Becoming knowledgeable is not becoming a buddha, but becoming an innocent child, reaching to the sources playfully without any seriousness, joyously and cheerfully, dancing... Take your energy to the very source and remain there just for a few moments, and you will be filled with a new experience which goes on growing every day.\nSoon you find you are filled with light – not only filled, but the light starts radiating around your body. That’s what has been called the aura, and what Wilhelm Reich was trying scientifically to prove. But he was forced into an insane asylum because people could not understand what he was talking about – “What radiation is he talking about?”\nBut now, Kirlian photography is able to take the photograph of your life aura around your body. The healthier you are, the bigger is the aura. In your happiness it dances around you; in your misery it shrinks. When a miserable person was used as an object by Kirlian, he could not find any aura in the photograph – the aura had shrunk inside. But when he photographed children dancing and enjoying, joyfully plucking the wildflowers or collecting stones on the seabeach, he found such a tremendous aura around them.\nThe same aura has been found around the buddhas. And it is almost miraculous that although no photography was available in the times of Buddha or Krishna, the paintings, the statues all have the aura – a round aura around the head.\nOnce you have seen your own life source, you start seeing the same light radiating from every object in the world, every person in the world. You can see from the aura whether the person is miserable or is happy.\nHis master, Ungan, asked him, “ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?”\nTozan was a scholar, and he knew the way a buddha speaks. And now he himself has experienced it – you can see it in his answer. He says, “I do not say that I am not happy, but to say I am happy will make it a very ordinary statement. To say that I am happy is not something great, and what I have found is so great that it cannot be described by the word ‘happiness’, it is far more. So I will not say I am not happy. You have to understand, it is something more than happiness. Words cannot describe it. Only this much I can say: I have found a bright pearl in the heap of garbage.”\nWhat he is calling the “heap of garbage,” is his scholarship. He has accumulated so much knowledge unnecessarily, and all that knowledge was only heaping up and hiding the original being – your very roots into existence.\nIt is not ordinary happiness, in fact there is no word that can describe it. ‘Blissfulness’ comes closer, even closer comes ‘benediction’, still closer comes ‘ecstasy’. But beyond that, no word is there; the experience is far deeper than ecstasy itself.\nFOR A WHILE AFTER HIS ENLIGHTENMENT, TOZAN CONTINUED TO TRAVEL AROUND CHINA. ONE DAY HE ARRIVED AT LEH T’AN AND MET THE HEAD MONK, CH’U. CH’U GREETED TOZAN AND SAID:\n“WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL –\nTHE INCONCEIVABLE REALMS OF TAO AND BUDDHA!”\nCh’u greeted Tozan, and in his greeting he said, “WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL – THE INCONCEIVABLE REALMS OF TAO AND BUDDHA! I can see in you the very meeting of Buddha and Tao.”\nIt is the same experience. TOZAN RESPONDED, “I DON’T KNOW ABOUT THESE REALMS you are talking about. WHO IS TALKING OF THEM?”\nHe is indicating to Ch’u that it is beyond words – “Look inside yourself. Who is saying these words? From where are these words coming? That source is beyond the words.”\nCH’U REMAINED SILENT, AND TOZAN SHOUTED, “SPEAK!”\nCH’U THEN SAID, “NO NEED TO FIGHT ABOUT IT. THAT IS THE WAY TO MISS.”\nTOZAN REPLIED, “IF IT HAS NOT BEEN MENTIONED, HOW CAN THERE BE FIGHTING AND MISSING?”\nCH’U COULD MAKE NO ANSWER TO THIS.\nTOZAN THEN SAID, “BUDDHA AND TAO – NEXT YOU WILL TALK OF SUTRAS.”\n“First you mention Buddha and Tao, and then you will start talking about sutras. Once you begin to talk, there is no end to talking, and the thing you are trying to talk about is beyond words.”\nCH’U REPLIED, “WHAT DO THE SUTRAS SAY ABOUT THIS?”\nTOZAN RESPONDED, “WHEN ALL IS UNDERSTOOD, WORDS ARE FORGOTTEN.” CH’U SAID, “THIS IS SICKNESS OF THE MIND.”\nTOZAN SAID, “IS THIS SICKNESS SLIGHT OR SEVERE?” CH’U COULD MAKE NO REPLY TO TOZAN.\nThat was the reason Isan sent him to Ungan. He was a man of great scholarship, and once he has found his own buddha, he will become a very great master. Ordinary teachers will not even be able to understand him. Ch’u was an ordinary teacher of Tao and Buddhism both. And you can see that Tozan denied even Buddha and Tao. Those words only indicate, they don’t describe. And he said to Ch’u, “If you go on, soon you will start talking about sutras.”\nYou can see his philosophical approach. Now that he has found the truth, it is very difficult for anybody who is just a scholar even to talk with him. He will be able to defeat any scholarly person very easily.\nSeeing that Tozan is saying that even Buddha and Tao are not exactly the experience, Ch’u, as a teacher, said, “What do the sutras say about this?” He is still talking about sutras – “What do the sutras say about this unknowable, this inexpressible? You are indicating that it is beyond Buddha and beyond Tao.”\nTozan said, “WHEN ALL IS UNDERSTOOD, WORDS ARE FORGOTTEN. Once you have known it, once you have tasted it, you become silent.” Of course a teacher will not agree on this point.\nCH’U, in anger, SAID, “THIS IS SICKNESS OF THE MIND.” TOZAN SAID, “IS THIS SICKNESS SLIGHT OR SEVERE?”\nWhat kind of sickness? It is not sickness, but a teacher is confined to the mind. You say anything beyond the mind and you are simply talking nonsense. You are sick, you are mad, you are insane. A teacher is confined to the mind, a master is beyond the mind.\nCh’u could make no reply to Tozan’s inquiry whether this sickness was slight or severe.\nONE DAY THE MONK AKINOBO, WENT TO VISIT A POET FRIEND OF HIS. CHATTING, HE MENTIONED THAT HE HAD MADE A COLLECTION OF POEMS – ONE FOR EACH DAY OF THE YEAR. HE READ HIM ONE:\nTHE FOURTH DAY OF THE NEW YEAR; WHAT BETTER DAY\nTO LEAVE THE WORLD?\nTHAT VERY DAY WAS THE FOURTH DAY OF THE FIRST MONTH OF THE YEAR 1718. NO SOONER HAD HE FINISHED RECITING THE VERSE THAN AKINOBO NODDED HIS HEAD AND DIED.\nZen masters know how to live and also know how to die. They take neither life seriously nor death seriously. Seriousness is a sick way of looking at existence. A man of perfection will love to live, and will love to die. His life will be a dance, and his death will be a song. There will be no distinction between life and death.\nQuestion 4\nManeesha’s question:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nTHE PHILOSOPHER KARL JASPERS, WRITES IN VOLUME THREE OF HIS BOOK, ‘PHILOSOPHY’: “TO ASK REAL QUESTIONS ABOUT REALITY, MAN MUST HAVE THOUGHT, INVESTIGATED, AND ORIENTED HIMSELF BY DISTINCTIONS... REAL IS WHAT CAN BE MEASURED, WHAT OUR SENSES CAN PERCEIVE IN SPACE AND TIME ACCORDING TO RULES, WHAT CAN BE CONTROLLED OR CALCULATED, AT LEAST, BY APPROPRIATE MEASURES.”\nWOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT?\nManeesha, Karl Jaspers is a great philosopher, but he is not a master. What he is saying is the definition of matter. Exactly the word ‘matter’ comes from the Sanskrit word matra. Matra means that which can be measured. Matter means that which can be measured. And that which cannot be measured is your reality.\nKarl Jaspers is confusing reality with matter. Matter is real, but reality is far more than matter; it also includes consciousness, which is not measurable. You cannot measure it by any means. How many feet of consciousness do you have, or how many miles, or how many kilos...?\nMatter is that which can be measured, and consciousness is that which cannot be measured. And Jaspers is confining himself to matter as the only reality. He is absolutely wrong. About matter he is right, but about reality he is wrong, because reality is much more than matter.\nEven Karl Jaspers cannot say how many kilos of consciousness he has. There is no way of measuring consciousness. And certainly, even Karl Jaspers cannot deny that he has consciousness. Who is denying?\nI am reminded of a small story about Mulla Nasruddin.…\nHe was talking about his generosity to friends in a restaurant. The friends said, “You are simply talking about generosity, but we have never seen any generous act on your part. You have not even invited us for a cup of tea.”\nMulla said, “Come on! You are all invited – the whole crowd in the restaurant. Come to my home for dinner.”\nThey could not believe it! They knew that this was a very miserly man. He had been caught just because he was boasting about his generosity.\nAs they were approaching his home, Nasruddin became aware about his wife, and that he had brought a trouble to himself unnecessarily. Now how was he going to convince his wife? In the first place, he had gone in the morning to fetch some vegetables, and he had not returned till evening, and now he was coming with a crowd of people.\nSo he told the crowd, “You understand the problem between a husband and wife. You just remain outside for a few minutes. First let me go in to convince my wife that I have invited a few friends.”\nSo he went in, closed the door, and told his wife that by mistake he had invited a crowd – “Now you have to be a help to me.”\nThe wife said, “What can I do? There is nothing in the house – you have been away the whole day... not even vegetables.”\nMulla Nasruddin said, “That is not the point. You simply go to the door and ask the people why they are crowding there. Obviously they will say that I have invited them for dinner. You simply deny it. Simply say, ‘Mulla Nasruddin has not been home since morning.’ You just go and tell them, ‘Go away. He is not here.’”\nThe wife was puzzled, but something had to be done. She opened the door, and Mulla Nasruddin was watching what was happening from the second-story window. The wife said, “He is not in the house. For whom are you waiting?”\nThey said, “He came with us, and he went on in front of us. We are all witnesses. He has invited us for the dinner – perhaps you don’t know, but he has gone inside the house.”\nThe wife said, “He is not inside the house.”\nThey said, “This is strange. We came with him. He has told us to wait here. You just go in and find out. He must be inside watching, or looking for you.”\nThe wife would not let them in. The crowd tried to go in. The crowd said, “We are all friends of your husband. Let us look inside!”\nMulla, seeing the situation, shouted from the upper story, “This is absolute nonsense! When she is saying he is not in, he is not in! Don’t you feel ashamed challenging a poor woman? He may have come with you, but he may have gone out again from the back door.”\nAnd he himself was talking.…\nJust ask Karl Jaspers, “Is your consciousness miserable?” If he denies that he has consciousness, then who is denying? Either he has to deny it or he has to accept it, but in every case even his denial will be a proof of consciousness.\nThis is a strange thing about not only Karl Jaspers, but about all the philosophers of the world. They go on saying that only matter exists, because matter can be experienced by eyes, by ears, by hands, by all your senses. It can be measured, hence, it is the only reality. But the truth is that even those who deny the existence of the immeasurable are accepting even in their denial, consciousness. Otherwise, who is denying?\nIt is very amazing that a great intellectual like Karl Jaspers, a very respectable philosopher of this century, talks like a stupid man. But all philosophers talk like stupid men. His saying that only that which can be measured is real, is absolutely wrong. That which can be measured is matter, and that which cannot be measured is also real, but it is consciousness.\nOur search is for the immeasurable. The measurable can be left to the scientists. The mystics are concerned with the immeasurable.\nNow, it is time for Sardar Gurudayal Singh.…\nCaptain Codfish, the old pirate, is in the Stoned Seagull Pub one night, telling stories from his life at sea.\n“I had a parrot once,” declares Codfish, drinking his rum. “He was the most incredible bird! He could imitate anything – Charlie Chaplin, Jack the Ripper, Marilyn Monroe, Pope the Polack... even Nancy Reagan!”\n“Wow!” says Igor, the barman. “Where is he? What happened to him?” “Ah!” cries the old pirate. “Times got hard, and I got hungry – I ate him!” “You ate your parrot?” cries Igor in disgust. “What did he taste like?”\n“He tasted just like turkey,” replies Codfish. “That parrot could imitate anything!”\nPaddy has a late night at the pub, and when it closes, he staggers outside in a drunken stupor. He wanders around the streets trying to remember which way to go home, and finally gives up. Paddy sits down on the street and looks all around him until a taxi pulls up beside him.\n“Ah!” groans Paddy, clambering into the back and lying down on the seat. “Can you take me to number five, Fergus Street?”\nThe cabdriver looks around at Paddy and replies, “Hey, mister, this is number five, Fergus Street!” “Ah!” groans Paddy. “Alright! But next time, don’t drive so fast!”\nOn a foggy morning in Vienna, Austria, the two famous psychoanalysts, Doctor Sigfried Mind, and Doctor Krazy Karl Kong, meet in the little Brown Danube Cafe.\nOver a table set with coffee and cream cakes, Doctor Kong suddenly jumps up, grabs Sigfried by the neck, and shakes him.\n“We must go this time!” shouts Karl. “We have tried six times already! We must go to the pyramids in Egypt to see the mummies!”\n“MUMMIES?” screeches Sigfried, collapsing into the cream cakes in a dead faint. Doctor Kong pours coffee on Doctor Mind’s head until he recovers.\n“Come on, Mind,” cries Doctor Kong, slapping him across the face. “We can do it! We have to explore this mystery of death!”\n“DEATH?” screeches Mind, and he faints again into the plate of cream cakes.\nHalf an hour later, at the Vienna airport, Doctor Krazy Karl Kong is dragging Doctor Sigfried Mind by the collar onto the plane bound for Cairo.\n“Come on, Mind!” cries Krazy Kong, huffing and puffing. “We have made it this far, we have got to see those mummies!”\n“MUMMIES?” screeches Sigfried, falling in a faint on top of Nellie Knickers, the stewardess.\nKong and Nellie drag Mind to his seat, and strap him down. The plane takes off, and three hours later, arrives in the Land of the Pyramids. Kong carries the babbling Doctor Mind to the herd of rented camels, which are waiting to take them to the pharaohs’ tombs.\nDoctor Kong shouts out to their guide, Abdul Babul, “Take us to the mummies!”\n“MUMMIES?” screeches Mind, fainting and falling straight off his camel, nose first, into a sand dune.\nTwo days later, the famous psychoanalysts and their camels arrive at the huge pyramids. Doctor Kong jumps down, lights a torch, grabs Doctor Mind by the collar, and starts dragging him into the dark, mysterious crypts.\nSuddenly, in the darkness, Doctor Kong trips over something. “What is that?” screeches Mind.\n“Ah! It is alright – it is only a dead cat!” exclaims Doctor Kong. “DEATH!” screeches Mind. And he falls over in a cold faint.\n“Pull yourself together, Doctor!” shouts Kong. “We are almost there!”\nAnd Kong grabs Sigfried by the shoe, and drags him feet first towards a huge golden coffin. “Stand up!” cries Doctor Kong, propping Mind up against the wall, and handing him the burning torch.\nThen Krazy Karl Kong bends over and lifts back the heavy, creaking coffin lid. The lid falls to the ground with a loud crash, and when the dust clears, Doctor Kong is left standing with his mouth wide open, gazing at the spooky sight before his eyes.\nHe turns and grabs the frozen Doctor Mind by the collar and pulls his face down into the coffin. “There!” shouts Kong, in triumph. “This is a MUMMY!”\n“MUMMY?” screeches Sigfried. But he just stares in disbelief, with his eyes popping out. “MUMMY?” he screeches again. “Hey, this looks more like daddy!”\nIt is time, Nivedano... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)\nBe silent... Close your eyes... and feel yourself completely frozen. This is the right moment to enter inwards.\nGather all your energy, your total consciousness, and rush towards the inner center with deep intensity and urgency.\nThe center is just two inches below the navel, inside the body. Faster... and faster... Deeper... and deeper...\nAs you come closer to the center of being, a great silence descends over you, and inside a peace, a blissfulness, a light that fills your whole interior. This is your original being. This is your buddha.\nAt this moment, witness that you are not the body, not the mind, not the heart, but just the pure witnessing self, the pure consciousness. This is your buddhahood, your hidden nature, your meeting with the universe. These are your roots.\nRelax... Nivedano... (Drumbeat)\nRelax... and just be a silent witness.\nYou start melting like ice in the ocean. Gautama the Buddha Auditorium becomes an oceanic field of consciousness. You are no longer separate – this is your oneness with existence.\nTo be one with existence is to be a buddha, it is your very nature. It is not a question of searching and finding, you are it, right now.\nGather all the flowers, the fragrance, the flame and the fire, the immeasurable, and bring it with you as you come back.\nNivedano... (Drumbeat)\nCome back peacefully, silently, as a buddha.\nJust for a few seconds close your eyes and remember the path and the source you have found, and the buddha nature that you have experienced.\nThis moment you are the most blessed people on the earth. Remembering yourself as a buddha is the most precious experience, because it is your eternity, it is your immortality.\nIt is not you, it is your very existence. You are one with the stars and the trees and the sky and the ocean. You are no longer separate.\nThe last word of Buddha was, sammasati. Remember that you are a buddha – sammasati.

REPLY TO TOZAN.</p><p>Friends,</p><p><br></p><p>Before the sutras there are a few questions from the sannyasins.
Question 1</p><p>The first question:</p><p><br></p><p>GESTA ITAL, A FORMER FAMOUS GERMAN ACTRESS, WAS THE FIRST WESTERN
WOMAN WHO WAS ALLOWED TO ENTER IN A ZEN MONASTERY IN JAPAN AND TO WORK
WITH AN ENLIGHTENED MASTER.</p><p><br></p><p>SHE WROTE TWO BOOKS ABOUT HER PATH AND HER EXPERIENCE OF
ENLIGHTENMENT. WHEN I READ THESE BOOKS I HAD THE IMPRESSION OF A VERY
HARD AND LONELY</p><p>PATH. BEING WITH YOU IS MUCH MORE JOYFUL AND PLAYFUL. WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS DIFFERENCE?</p><p><br></p><p>The traditional Zen is hard. It takes twenty to thirty years of
constant meditation, withdrawing from everywhere all your energy and
devoting it only to meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>That tradition comes from Gautam Buddha himself. He had to find his
enlightenment after twelve years of hard work.</p><p><br></p><p>I am changing it completely from the traditional Zen, because I don’t
see that the contemporary man can devote twenty or thirty years to
meditation only. If Zen remains that hard, it will disappear from the
world. It has already disappeared from China, it is disappearing from
Japan, and it disappeared from India long ago. It remained in India for
only five hundred years after Gautam Buddha. In the sixth century it
reached China, remained there for only a few centuries, and moved to
Japan. And now it is almost extinct from both China and Japan.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised to know that my books are being taught in the
Zen monasteries. Zen masters have written letters to me: “Perhaps now
Zen will exist in India, in its original place. It is disappearing from
Japan because people are more interested in technology, in science.”</p><p><br></p><p>That is the situation in India too. Very few people are interested in
the inner exploration. Here you can find a few people from every
country, but these are so few compared to the five billion human beings
on the earth. Ten thousand is not a great number.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen has to be transformed in a way that the contemporary man can be
interested in it. It has to be easy, relaxed, it has not to be hard.
That old traditional type is no longer possible, nor is it needed. Once
it has been explored, once a single man has become enlightened, the path
becomes easy. You don’t have to discover electricity again and again.
Once discovered you start using it – you don’t have to be great
scientists.</p><p><br></p><p>The man who discovered electricity worked on it for almost twenty
years. Three hundred disciples started with him and nobody remained
because it took so long; everybody became exhausted. But the original
scientist continued. His explanation to his own disciples was, “The more
we are failing in finding the root of electricity, the closer we are
going to the very root. Every failure is bringing us closer to the
discovery.”</p><p><br></p><p>And finally, one night in the darkness, suddenly the first electric
bulb started radiating. And you cannot conceive the joy of the man who
had been working for thirty years. His silence... he was in awe. He
could not believe his own eyes that after all this time it had happened,
electricity had been controlled – “Now in our hands, how to use it?”</p><p><br></p><p>His wife called to him, “Come inside the bedroom, it is the middle of
the night. Put the light out!”</p><p><br></p><p>She was not aware that it was no ordinary light, and that the
scientist had called her – “Come here and be the first to see something
original. You will be the first person I will introduce to the secrets
of electricity.”</p><p>Now, you don’t have to work for thirty years to know about
electricity. Nor do you have to work thirty years for the Zen
experience.</p><p><br></p><p>The awakening of the buddha is a very easy and relaxed phenomenon.
Now that so many people have awakened, the path has become clear-cut; it
is no longer hard and arduous. You can playfully enter inside and
joyously experience the awakening of awareness. It is not as far away as
it was for Gautam Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>For Gautam Buddha it was an absolute unknown. He was searching for it
like a blind man, knowing nothing about where he was going. But he was a
man of tremendous courage, who for twelve years went on searching,
exploring every method available in his time... all the teachers who
were talking about philosophy and yoga. He went from one teacher to
another, and every teacher finally said to him, “I can tell you only
this much. More than this I don’t know myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, he remained alone, and he dropped all yoga disciplines. He
had his own five disciples, who thought that he was a great ascetic. But
when they saw that he had dropped all yoga discipline, and he was no
longer fasting, they dropped him. All those five disciples left him –
“He has fallen from his greatness; he is no longer a saint; he has
become ordinary.”</p><p><br></p><p>But in that ordinariness, when he had dropped everything – just being
tired and exhausted – that fullmoon night when the five disciples left
him, he slept under the bodhi tree, completely free from this world and
completely free from the very search for that world. For the first time
he was utterly relaxed: no desire to find anything, no desire to become
anything. And in that moment of non- desiring, he suddenly awakened and
became a buddha. Buddhahood came to him in a relaxed state.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t have to work for twelve years, you can just start from the
relaxed state. It was the last point in Gautam Buddha’s journey. It can
be the first point in your journey.</p><p><br></p><p>And the first thing Gautam Buddha did after he became awakened was to
go in search of those five disciples to share what had happened to him.
And when he reached those five disciples... they saw him coming – it is
a very beautiful story.</p><p><br></p><p>They decided, “Gautama is coming, but we are not going to pay any
respect to him. He has stopped being a holy man; he has started living a
relaxed and comfortable life.”</p><p><br></p><p>But as Buddha came closer, all the five disciples stood up. Although
they had decided not to pay him any respect, in spite of their decision,
they could see that Gautama had changed completely – “He is no more the
same person we used to know. He is coming with such a silence, with such
contentment. It seems he has found it.” And they all touched Gautam
Buddha’s feet.</p><p><br></p><p>And Gautam Buddha’s first statement to them was, “When you had
decided not to pay attention to me, why are you paying such
respect?”</p><p><br></p><p>All those five asked to be forgiven. They said, “We were thinking you
were the same old Gautama. We used to know you – for five years we have
been together, but you are not the same person anymore.”</p><p>Enlightenment is such a transformation that you are a totally
different person. The old person dies away, and a totally new awareness,
a fresh bliss, a flowering, a spring which has never been there...</p><p><br></p><p>It took twelve years for Gautam Buddha. It need not take even twelve
minutes for you. It is simply an art, to relax into yourself. In the
traditional Zen they are still doing whatever Buddha did in his
ignorance, and finally they drop it.</p><p><br></p><p>I am telling you, why not drop it right now? You can relax this very
moment!</p><p>And in that relaxation you will find the light, the awareness, the
awakening.</p><p><br></p><p>What has happened to Gesta Ital, is not necessarily an introduction
to Zen. She has been in the company of old and traditional Zen masters.
I understand Zen to be a very simple, innocent, joyful method. There is
nothing ascetic in it, nothing life-negative – no need to renounce the
world, no need to become a monk, no need to enter a monastery. You have
to enter into yourself. That can be done anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>We are doing it in the simplest way possible. And only if Zen becomes
as simple as I am trying to make it, can the contemporary man be
interested in it. Otherwise he has so much to do – so many things to do,
so many paths to explore, so many things to distract him.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen has to become such a small playful thing, that while you are
going to sleep – just before that – within five minutes you can enter
into yourself, and you can remain at the very center of your being the
whole night. Your whole night can become a peaceful, silent awareness.
Sleep will be in the body, but underneath it there will be a current of
light from the evening till the morning.</p><p><br></p><p>And once you know that even in sleep a certain awareness can be
present inside you, then the whole day, doing all kinds of things, you
can remain alert, conscious. Buddhahood has to be a very normal,
ordinary, simple and human affair.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>I CANNOT PUT IT INTO WORDS HOW MUCH I AM ALWAYS TOUCHED BY THE BEAUTY
OF YOUR EXPRESSIONS – IN YOUR WORDS, YOUR GESTURES AND NOW ESPECIALLY IN
YOUR PAINTINGS.</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENS, WHEN YOU ARE SITTING IN FRONT OF AN EMPTY
PAPER? IS THERE STILL AN URGE FOR ARTISTIC CREATIVITY WHEN ONE IS
ENLIGHTENED? COULD YOU PLEASE TELL US ABOUT ZEN AND ART AND
CREATIVITY?</p><p>Zen prevents you from nothing. It opens everything that is potential
in you. If you have a potentiality of being a painter, Zen will open it
– you may not have been aware of it. If there is a potentiality</p><p>for poetry, Zen will open that potentiality, and for the first time
you will start thinking in poetry, not in prose.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is true about music or dance, or scientific exploration. Any
kind of original experiences, Zen allows you. It is not preventive of
anything. It is affirmative, the most affirmative experience in life. It
simply makes you aware of all that is hidden in you, of all that you
have never looked at. It not only makes you aware, it helps you to
explore that potentiality.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen is not a dry, desertlike experience, it is very juicy, a
beautiful garden – a spring in your life where flowers suddenly start
opening up. One never knows what is going to happen to him when he
becomes aware. It is not a decision on your part, it is not a choice. It
is a choiceless, simple experience – you start moving into a certain
direction. Suddenly that direction becomes so full of life, so
attractive that you can devote everything to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen is a very creative experience; it is not like other religions.
All the religions are non-creative. In fact, the so-called saints don’t
do anything. They are not great poets, they are not great dancers, they
are not great musicians. But the real and authentic saints, who are very
few among the so-called saints...</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I received the information that this pope in his
four years of office has made more than two thousand people saints. It
is a certificate. He goes on giving certificates to all kinds of people
who can donate money. Now the Catholic church owns the biggest bank in
the world – the Bank of America. The Catholic church owns the greatest
amount of land in the world – more than any other country.</p><p><br></p><p>The method in the past has been war, killing people. Thousands of
people have been killed just to take possession of their properties, or
they have been forced to become Catholics. A single Catholic emperor,
Constantine, killed ten thousand people in a single day. He just called
an assembly of all those who were not Catholics in a great auditorium in
Rome, and ordered the army to shoot everybody: “We don’t want anybody
other than Christians in Rome.” He forced the whole of Italy to become
Christian... just at the point of the gun.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole history of Christianity is of wars and nothing else –
killing and violence. And the same is true about the other religions in
a lesser measure; they are destructive. They are destructive in many
ways. They destroy people by creating guilt, by making them sinners, by
forcing them to renounce the world and all that is pleasant, and to go
into hardships unnecessarily. But those who go into hardships are
respected and their hardship has nothing to contribute to the world,
only sickness, only guilt. All your saints are together enforcing guilt
in you.</p><p><br></p><p>So in this way they destroy humanity, and in other ways they kill
people because they don’t belong to their fold. They force people –
either by the sword, or with bread. In the past they used to come with a
sword, now they come with bread. The poor have been always vulnerable to
being converted, either by force or by bribery. But this is not
religiousness at all, this is pure politics.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen is an authentic religious experience. Its authenticity is in its
opening of creativeness in human beings. Zen masters have never killed
anyone. They have not forced anyone to their path; on the contrary, you
have to go to them. And it has been very difficult to be accepted; the
masters have</p><p>been very choosy. Unless you show an immense desire and longing, they
will not initiate you; the question of conversion does not arise.</p><p>You have to go to the well, the well does not come to you. The well
does not even invite you, it is simply there, available.</p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN ENERGY GOES INWARD IT TURNS INTO THOUGHTS, FEELINGS, EMOTIONS,
AND WHEN ENERGY GOES OUTWARD IT TURNS INTO RELATIONSHIPS WITH BEINGS AND
NATURE. BUT WHEN ENERGY DOES NOT MOVE INWARD OR OUTWARD, IT IS JUST
THERE PULSATING, VIBRATING. THEN IT IS ONE WITH THE EXISTENCE, ONE WITH
THE WHOLE. IS THIS ZAZEN?</p><p>Exactly. When the energy is just there – not going anywhere, just
pulsating at the original source, just radiating its light there,
blossoming like a lotus, neither going out nor going in – it is simply
here and now.</p><p>When I say go inward, I am simply saying don’t go on moving in the
head.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole society forces your energy to move in the head. All
education consists of the basic technique of how to pulsate the energy
only in the head – how to make you a great mathematician, how to make
you a great physician. All the education in the world consists of taking
the energy into the head.</p><p>Zen asks you to come out of the head and go to the basic source –
from where the educational system around the world has been taking the
energy, putting it into the head, and turning it into thoughts, images,
and creating thinking. It has its uses. It is not that Zen is not aware
of the uses of energy in the head, but if all the energy is used in the
head, you will never become aware of your eternity. You may become a
very great thinker and philosopher, but you will never know, as an
experience, what life is. You will never know as an experience, what it
is to be one with the whole.</p><p>When the energy is just at the center, pulsating... When it is not
moving anywhere, neither in the head nor in the heart, but it is at the
very source from where the heart takes it, the head takes it...
pulsating at the very source – that is the very meaning of Zazen.</p><p>Zazen means just sitting at the very source, not moving anywhere. A
tremendous force arises, a transformation of energy into light and love,
into greater life, into compassion, into creativity. It can take many
forms, but first you have to learn how to be at the source. Then the
source will decide where your potential is. You can relax at the source,
and it will take you to your very potential. It does not mean that you
have to stop thinking forever, it simply means you should be aware and
alert and capable of moving into the source. When you need the head you
can move the energy into the head, and when you need to love, you can
move the energy into the heart.</p><p>But you need not think twenty-four hours. When you are not thinking
you have to relax back into your center – that keeps the Zen man
constantly content, alert, joyful. A blissfulness surrounds him; it is
not an act, it is simply radiation.</p><p>Zazen is the strategy of Zen. Literally it means just sitting.
Sitting where? Sitting at the very source. And once in a while, if you
go on sitting in the source, you can manage all mental activities
without any disturbance, you can manage all heart activities without any
difficulty. And still, whenever you have time, you need not
unnecessarily think, you need not unnecessarily feel, you can just
be.</p><p><br></p><p>Just being is Zazen.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you can just be – only for a few minutes in twenty-four hours
– that is enough to keep you alert of your buddhahood.</p><p><br></p><p>Before the sutras, a little biographical note.</p><p><br></p><p>TOZAN RYOKAI, A DISCIPLE OF UNGAN, WAS BORN IN CHINA IN 807, AND DIED
IN 869. HE ORIGINALLY WAS A MEMBER OF THE VINAYA SECT, BUT LATER BECAME
INTERESTED IN ZEN AND SET OUT ON A JOURNEY TO FIND A MASTER.</p><p><br></p><p>The Vinaya sect is the Buddhist name of the people who are interested
in the scriptures, in the words of the masters in a philosophical and
scholarly way. They are mentally active, but they are not moving into
the experience themselves. They gather as much knowledge as possible,
they become very wise. They know all the answers that are in the sutras,
but they don’t have a single experience of their own.</p><p><br></p><p>Tozan was first a scholar, studying all the literature – and Buddhism
has the greatest literature in the world. Compared to any other religion
it has more scriptures.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as Gautam Buddha died, his disciples became separated into
thirty-two branches. Immediately there were thirty-two branches of
scholarship, of different scriptures and sutras, pretending to be
authentic, pretending to be the only true ones. The problem was that for
forty-two years Gautam Buddha was teaching, morning and evening – a few
people heard a few things, a few people heard a few other things.</p><p><br></p><p>In forty-two years he was constantly moving from one place to another
place. Obviously there were different people who had heard different
things from him, and they compiled sutras. Immediately thirty-two
branches started. Gautam Buddha had not written a single word, but every
branch pretended to be the authentic one – “this is what Buddha
said...”</p><p><br></p><p>It is very difficult now to find out what actually was said by Gautam
Buddha, and what was added by the disciples. So there is a great
scholarship in the Buddhist world where people search into scriptures
trying to find what is authentic and what is not.</p><p><br></p><p>Just recently, the same kind of scholarship has started in Europe.
The professors and the very scholarly Christians have formed a special
committee, the Biblical Scholars. And they are now searching for what
exactly was said by Jesus, and what has been added by others – what is
fiction, what is myth, what is truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days ago, Pope the Polack declared to all the Catholics of
the world: “Don’t listen to the Biblical Scholars” – because the
Biblical Scholars are taking out many things which have been</p><p>added to the Bible which are not true. Events, miracles, the virgin
birth, the resurrection... the Biblical Scholars are taking all those
things out. It is agreed that they are the most scholarly group in
Europe concerning the Bible.</p><p><br></p><p>They meet every few months, and they discuss papers. And if you
listen to them, almost ninety percent of the Bible disappears. And they
are absolutely right, because for the first time they are searching at
the roots from where this saying, this statement, this gospel, has come.
A few are found to be in the ancient scriptures of the pagans, and those
scriptures have been destroyed so that nobody can prove that Jesus ever
said these things.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the idea of the virgin birth is more ancient than Jesus. It was
a pagan god, a Roman god who was thought to be born from a virgin, and
to the same god, the crucifixion happened. And to the same god is
connected the idea of the resurrection. All that has been taken and
compiled into the Bible. The pagans have been destroyed, their temples
have been burned, their scriptures have been destroyed. Now these
Biblical Scholars are trying to find ways and methods to uncover the
facts from contemporary literature about when Jesus was alive.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the gospels was written in India – the fifth gospel of Thomas.
It has not been included in the Bible, for the simple reason that it was
not available to Constantine, who was compiling, and who was deciding
what was to be included and what was not to be included. It was because
of him that all these ideas and mythologies and fictions have been added
to the life of Jesus.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is true about Buddhist literature: much is borrowed from
Hindu literature; much is borrowed from Jaina literature, because these
were contemporaries. And a few contemporaries of Buddha have left no
literature behind, but they were also teaching in the places where
Buddha was teaching, so many of their teachings have been compiled and
mixed with Gautam Buddha’s.</p><p><br></p><p>A very scholarly tradition exists in Zen to find out the original
teachings of Buddha. But even if you can find what is the original
statement and what is not, that does not mean you can become
enlightened. You may know exactly what Buddha said, but that will not
make any difference to your consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Tozan was first a scholar, and found that however you go on trying to
know and find the original sources, you still remain ignorant. You
become a great knower, but deep down you know nothing about yourself.
And the question is not to know what Buddha said, the question is to
know your own inner buddha, your own inner consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>After being in the scholarly Vinaya sect, he became interested in
Zen. He dropped out of the scholarly world and set out on a journey to
find a master. He had been with teachers, great scholars, but none of
them was a master.</p><p><br></p><p>And a master need not be a scholar – it is not a necessity. He may be
a scholar – that is accidental. What is necessary and existential is his
own knowing, his own experience.</p><p><br></p><p>So he went in search of a man who himself knows what is the truth,
and who can tell him the way to it.</p><p><br></p><p>The sutra:</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>TOZAN HAD A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER INANIMATE OBJECTS EXPOUND THE
DHARMA. TOZAN VISITED ISAN, WHO RECOMMENDED THAT HE GO TO SEE UNGAN.</p><p><br></p><p>His inquiry was whether inanimate objects in the world expound the
dharma, the ultimate truth – whether you can find in the objective world
the ultimate truth.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what science is trying to do – trying to find the ultimate
truth in objects. You cannot find it in objects. But this is part of the
Zen tradition, that also...</p><p><br></p><p>Isan was himself a master, but he recommended Tozan to go to see
Ungan, seeing that Tozan was a scholar. Isan was not a scholar – he was
a master, he knew his own buddhahood. But seeing that this man Tozan was
bound to ask philosophical questions, he sent him to Ungan, who was a
master and a scholar.</p><p><br></p><p>WITH UNGAN, TOZAN WAS FIRST MADE AWARE OF THE TRUTH, AND HE COMPOSED
THE FOLLOWING gatha TO RECORD HIS EXPERIENCE:</p><p><br></p><p>“HOW WONDERFUL! HOW WONDERFUL!</p><p><br></p><p>THE INANIMATE EXPOUNDING THE DHARMA – WHAT AN INEFFABLE TRUTH!”</p><p>Ungan told him to be in silence. And as you become silent, everything
around you starts expounding the truth: the trees and the mountains...
all the objects become suddenly aflame, afire with truth. If you are
sitting silently in your own source of being, then everything in the
world indicates towards the ultimate.</p><p><br></p><p>When he found his source he wrote this gatha:</p><p><br></p><p>“HOW WONDERFUL! HOW WONDERFUL!</p><p><br></p><p>THE INANIMATE EXPOUNDING THE DHARMA – WHAT AN INEFFABLE TRUTH!</p><p>IF YOU TRY TO HEAR IT WITH YOUR EARS, YOU WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND IT.
ONLY WHEN YOU HEAR IT THROUGH THE EYE,</p><p>WILL YOU REALLY KNOW IT.”</p><p><br></p><p>He is talking about the third eye. As you go inwards... your energy
is in the head. First it has to pass the third eye. Going deeper it will
pass through the heart, the fourth center – and the whole energy is at
the first center. From there it can rise back to the seventh center in
the head.</p><p>But if you remain hung up in the seventh center only, you will never
know as an experience what is truth. You have to come down to the
depths, to the valleys of your being. You have to reach to the very
roots from where you are joined with the whole.</p><p>UNGAN ASKED HIM, “ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?”</p><p><br></p><p>TOZAN ANSWERED, “I DO NOT SAY THAT I AM NOT HAPPY, BUT MY HAPPINESS
IS LIKE THAT OF SOMEONE WHO HAS PICKED UP A BRIGHT PEARL FROM A HEAP OF
GARBAGE.”</p><p>FOR A WHILE AFTER HIS ENLIGHTENMENT, TOZAN CONTINUED TO TRAVEL AROUND
CHINA.</p><p>He is saying that unless you see it yourself, there is no other way
to know it. You cannot hear it from somebody else. No buddha can preach
it to you, no master can teach it to you. They all can only make
gestures. They all can only indicate their finger towards the moon, but
the finger is not the moon. You have to drop looking at the finger, and
to start looking at the moon. When you look at the moon yourself, you
know the beauty of it. You cannot know that beauty by looking at the
finger pointing to the moon.</p><p>All knowledge is pointing to the moon. All sutras, all scriptures are
pointing to the moon – just fingers. And people are clinging to the
fingers, they have completely forgotten that the fingers are not the
point. The moon is far away, the finger is only pointing towards it.
Don’t cling to the finger; forget the finger. Forget all knowledge, all
scriptures, and look at your truth yourself.</p><p>It is not a question of your ears, it is a question of your very eye,
your inner eye. Unless you look inside... you cannot know it by hearing,
or by reading. Becoming knowledgeable is not becoming a buddha, but
becoming an innocent child, reaching to the sources playfully without
any seriousness, joyously and cheerfully, dancing... Take your energy to
the very source and remain there just for a few moments, and you will be
filled with a new experience which goes on growing every day.</p><p>Soon you find you are filled with light – not only filled, but the
light starts radiating around your body. That’s what has been called the
aura, and what Wilhelm Reich was trying scientifically to prove. But he
was forced into an insane asylum because people could not understand
what he was talking about – “What radiation is he talking about?”</p><p>But now, Kirlian photography is able to take the photograph of your
life aura around your body. The healthier you are, the bigger is the
aura. In your happiness it dances around you; in your misery it shrinks.
When a miserable person was used as an object by Kirlian, he could not
find any aura in the photograph – the aura had shrunk inside. But when
he photographed children dancing and enjoying, joyfully plucking the
wildflowers or collecting stones on the seabeach, he found such a
tremendous aura around them.</p><p>The same aura has been found around the buddhas. And it is almost
miraculous that although no photography was available in the times of
Buddha or Krishna, the paintings, the statues all have the aura – a
round aura around the head.</p><p>Once you have seen your own life source, you start seeing the same
light radiating from every object in the world, every person in the
world. You can see from the aura whether the person is miserable or is
happy.</p><p>His master, Ungan, asked him, “ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?”</p><p><br></p><p>Tozan was a scholar, and he knew the way a buddha speaks. And now he
himself has experienced it – you can see it in his answer. He says, “I
do not say that I am not happy, but to say I am happy will make it a
very ordinary statement. To say that I am happy is not something great,
and what I have found is so great that it cannot be described by the
word ‘happiness’, it is far more. So I will not say I am not happy. You
have to understand, it is something more than happiness. Words cannot
describe it. Only this much I can say: I have found a bright pearl in
the heap of garbage.”</p><p><br></p><p>What he is calling the “heap of garbage,” is his scholarship. He has
accumulated so much knowledge unnecessarily, and all that knowledge was
only heaping up and hiding the original being – your very roots into
existence.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not ordinary happiness, in fact there is no word that can
describe it. ‘Blissfulness’ comes closer, even closer comes
‘benediction’, still closer comes ‘ecstasy’. But beyond that, no word is
there; the experience is far deeper than ecstasy itself.</p><p><br></p><p>FOR A WHILE AFTER HIS ENLIGHTENMENT, TOZAN CONTINUED TO TRAVEL AROUND
CHINA. ONE DAY HE ARRIVED AT LEH T’AN AND MET THE HEAD MONK, CH’U. CH’U
GREETED TOZAN AND SAID:</p><p><br></p><p>“WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL –</p><p><br></p><p>THE INCONCEIVABLE REALMS OF TAO AND BUDDHA!”</p><p><br></p><p>Ch’u greeted Tozan, and in his greeting he said, “WONDERFUL,
WONDERFUL – THE INCONCEIVABLE REALMS OF TAO AND BUDDHA! I can see in you
the very meeting of Buddha and Tao.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is the same experience. TOZAN RESPONDED, “I DON’T KNOW ABOUT THESE
REALMS you are talking about. WHO IS TALKING OF THEM?”</p><p><br></p><p>He is indicating to Ch’u that it is beyond words – “Look inside
yourself. Who is saying these words? From where are these words coming?
That source is beyond the words.”</p><p><br></p><p>CH’U REMAINED SILENT, AND TOZAN SHOUTED, “SPEAK!”</p><p><br></p><p>CH’U THEN SAID, “NO NEED TO FIGHT ABOUT IT. THAT IS THE WAY TO
MISS.”</p><p><br></p><p>TOZAN REPLIED, “IF IT HAS NOT BEEN MENTIONED, HOW CAN THERE BE
FIGHTING AND MISSING?”</p><p><br></p><p>CH’U COULD MAKE NO ANSWER TO THIS.</p><p><br></p><p>TOZAN THEN SAID, “BUDDHA AND TAO – NEXT YOU WILL TALK OF SUTRAS.”</p><p><br></p><p>“First you mention Buddha and Tao, and then you will start talking
about sutras. Once you begin to talk, there is no end to talking, and
the thing you are trying to talk about is beyond words.”</p><p>CH’U REPLIED, “WHAT DO THE SUTRAS SAY ABOUT THIS?”</p><p><br></p><p>TOZAN RESPONDED, “WHEN ALL IS UNDERSTOOD, WORDS ARE FORGOTTEN.” CH’U
SAID, “THIS IS SICKNESS OF THE MIND.”</p><p>TOZAN SAID, “IS THIS SICKNESS SLIGHT OR SEVERE?” CH’U COULD MAKE NO
REPLY TO TOZAN.</p><p>That was the reason Isan sent him to Ungan. He was a man of great
scholarship, and once he has found his own buddha, he will become a very
great master. Ordinary teachers will not even be able to understand him.
Ch’u was an ordinary teacher of Tao and Buddhism both. And you can see
that Tozan denied even Buddha and Tao. Those words only indicate, they
don’t describe. And he said to Ch’u, “If you go on, soon you will start
talking about sutras.”</p><p><br></p><p>You can see his philosophical approach. Now that he has found the
truth, it is very difficult for anybody who is just a scholar even to
talk with him. He will be able to defeat any scholarly person very
easily.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing that Tozan is saying that even Buddha and Tao are not exactly
the experience, Ch’u, as a teacher, said, “What do the sutras say about
this?” He is still talking about sutras – “What do the sutras say about
this unknowable, this inexpressible? You are indicating that it is
beyond Buddha and beyond Tao.”</p><p><br></p><p>Tozan said, “WHEN ALL IS UNDERSTOOD, WORDS ARE FORGOTTEN. Once you
have known it, once you have tasted it, you become silent.” Of course a
teacher will not agree on this point.</p><p><br></p><p>CH’U, in anger, SAID, “THIS IS SICKNESS OF THE MIND.” TOZAN SAID, “IS
THIS SICKNESS SLIGHT OR SEVERE?”</p><p>What kind of sickness? It is not sickness, but a teacher is confined
to the mind. You say anything beyond the mind and you are simply talking
nonsense. You are sick, you are mad, you are insane. A teacher is
confined to the mind, a master is beyond the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Ch’u could make no reply to Tozan’s inquiry whether this sickness was
slight or severe.</p><p><br></p><p>ONE DAY THE MONK AKINOBO, WENT TO VISIT A POET FRIEND OF HIS.
CHATTING, HE MENTIONED THAT HE HAD MADE A COLLECTION OF POEMS – ONE FOR
EACH DAY OF THE YEAR. HE READ HIM ONE:</p><p><br></p><p>THE FOURTH DAY OF THE NEW YEAR; WHAT BETTER DAY</p><p>TO LEAVE THE WORLD?</p><p><br></p><p>THAT VERY DAY WAS THE FOURTH DAY OF THE FIRST MONTH OF THE YEAR 1718.
NO SOONER HAD HE FINISHED RECITING THE VERSE THAN AKINOBO NODDED HIS
HEAD AND DIED.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen masters know how to live and also know how to die. They take
neither life seriously nor death seriously. Seriousness is a sick way of
looking at existence. A man of perfection will love to live, and will
love to die. His life will be a dance, and his death will be a song.
There will be no distinction between life and death.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha’s question:</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>THE PHILOSOPHER KARL JASPERS, WRITES IN VOLUME THREE OF HIS BOOK,
‘PHILOSOPHY’: “TO ASK REAL QUESTIONS ABOUT REALITY, MAN MUST HAVE
THOUGHT, INVESTIGATED, AND ORIENTED HIMSELF BY DISTINCTIONS... REAL IS
WHAT CAN BE MEASURED, WHAT OUR SENSES CAN PERCEIVE IN SPACE AND TIME
ACCORDING TO RULES, WHAT CAN BE CONTROLLED OR CALCULATED, AT LEAST, BY
APPROPRIATE MEASURES.”</p><p><br></p><p>WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT?</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, Karl Jaspers is a great philosopher, but he is not a
master. What he is saying is the definition of matter. Exactly the word
‘matter’ comes from the Sanskrit word matra. Matra means that which can
be measured. Matter means that which can be measured. And that which
cannot be measured is your reality.</p><p><br></p><p>Karl Jaspers is confusing reality with matter. Matter is real, but
reality is far more than matter; it also includes consciousness, which
is not measurable. You cannot measure it by any means. How many feet of
consciousness do you have, or how many miles, or how many kilos...?</p><p><br></p><p>Matter is that which can be measured, and consciousness is that which
cannot be measured. And Jaspers is confining himself to matter as the
only reality. He is absolutely wrong. About matter he is right, but
about reality he is wrong, because reality is much more than matter.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Karl Jaspers cannot say how many kilos of consciousness he has.
There is no way of measuring consciousness. And certainly, even Karl
Jaspers cannot deny that he has consciousness. Who is denying?</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of a small story about Mulla Nasruddin.…</p><p><br></p><p>He was talking about his generosity to friends in a restaurant. The
friends said, “You are simply talking about generosity, but we have
never seen any generous act on your part. You have not even invited us
for a cup of tea.”</p><p>Mulla said, “Come on! You are all invited – the whole crowd in the
restaurant. Come to my home for dinner.”</p><p><br></p><p>They could not believe it! They knew that this was a very miserly
man. He had been caught just because he was boasting about his
generosity.</p><p><br></p><p>As they were approaching his home, Nasruddin became aware about his
wife, and that he had brought a trouble to himself unnecessarily. Now
how was he going to convince his wife? In the first place, he had gone
in the morning to fetch some vegetables, and he had not returned till
evening, and now he was coming with a crowd of people.</p><p><br></p><p>So he told the crowd, “You understand the problem between a husband
and wife. You just remain outside for a few minutes. First let me go in
to convince my wife that I have invited a few friends.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he went in, closed the door, and told his wife that by mistake he
had invited a crowd – “Now you have to be a help to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The wife said, “What can I do? There is nothing in the house – you
have been away the whole day... not even vegetables.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin said, “That is not the point. You simply go to the
door and ask the people why they are crowding there. Obviously they will
say that I have invited them for dinner. You simply deny it. Simply say,
‘Mulla Nasruddin has not been home since morning.’ You just go and tell
them, ‘Go away. He is not here.’”</p><p><br></p><p>The wife was puzzled, but something had to be done. She opened the
door, and Mulla Nasruddin was watching what was happening from the
second-story window. The wife said, “He is not in the house. For whom
are you waiting?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “He came with us, and he went on in front of us. We are
all witnesses. He has invited us for the dinner – perhaps you don’t
know, but he has gone inside the house.”</p><p><br></p><p>The wife said, “He is not inside the house.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “This is strange. We came with him. He has told us to wait
here. You just go in and find out. He must be inside watching, or
looking for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>The wife would not let them in. The crowd tried to go in. The crowd
said, “We are all friends of your husband. Let us look inside!”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla, seeing the situation, shouted from the upper story, “This is
absolute nonsense! When she is saying he is not in, he is not in! Don’t
you feel ashamed challenging a poor woman? He may have come with you,
but he may have gone out again from the back door.”</p><p><br></p><p>And he himself was talking.…</p><p><br></p><p>Just ask Karl Jaspers, “Is your consciousness miserable?” If he
denies that he has consciousness, then who is denying? Either he has to
deny it or he has to accept it, but in every case even his denial will
be a proof of consciousness.</p><p>This is a strange thing about not only Karl Jaspers, but about all
the philosophers of the world. They go on saying that only matter
exists, because matter can be experienced by eyes, by ears, by hands, by
all your senses. It can be measured, hence, it is the only reality. But
the truth is that even those who deny the existence of the immeasurable
are accepting even in their denial, consciousness. Otherwise, who is
denying?</p><p><br></p><p>It is very amazing that a great intellectual like Karl Jaspers, a
very respectable philosopher of this century, talks like a stupid man.
But all philosophers talk like stupid men. His saying that only that
which can be measured is real, is absolutely wrong. That which can be
measured is matter, and that which cannot be measured is also real, but
it is consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Our search is for the immeasurable. The measurable can be left to the
scientists. The mystics are concerned with the immeasurable.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, it is time for Sardar Gurudayal Singh.…</p><p><br></p><p>Captain Codfish, the old pirate, is in the Stoned Seagull Pub one
night, telling stories from his life at sea.</p><p><br></p><p>“I had a parrot once,” declares Codfish, drinking his rum. “He was
the most incredible bird! He could imitate anything – Charlie Chaplin,
Jack the Ripper, Marilyn Monroe, Pope the Polack... even Nancy
Reagan!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow!” says Igor, the barman. “Where is he? What happened to him?”
“Ah!” cries the old pirate. “Times got hard, and I got hungry – I ate
him!” “You ate your parrot?” cries Igor in disgust. “What did he taste
like?”</p><p>“He tasted just like turkey,” replies Codfish. “That parrot could
imitate anything!”</p><p><br></p><p>Paddy has a late night at the pub, and when it closes, he staggers
outside in a drunken stupor. He wanders around the streets trying to
remember which way to go home, and finally gives up. Paddy sits down on
the street and looks all around him until a taxi pulls up beside
him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah!” groans Paddy, clambering into the back and lying down on the
seat. “Can you take me to number five, Fergus Street?”</p><p><br></p><p>The cabdriver looks around at Paddy and replies, “Hey, mister, this
is number five, Fergus Street!” “Ah!” groans Paddy. “Alright! But next
time, don’t drive so fast!”</p><p>On a foggy morning in Vienna, Austria, the two famous psychoanalysts,
Doctor Sigfried Mind, and Doctor Krazy Karl Kong, meet in the little
Brown Danube Cafe.</p><p><br></p><p>Over a table set with coffee and cream cakes, Doctor Kong suddenly
jumps up, grabs Sigfried by the neck, and shakes him.</p><p>“We must go this time!” shouts Karl. “We have tried six times
already! We must go to the pyramids in Egypt to see the mummies!”</p><p><br></p><p>“MUMMIES?” screeches Sigfried, collapsing into the cream cakes in a
dead faint. Doctor Kong pours coffee on Doctor Mind’s head until he
recovers.</p><p>“Come on, Mind,” cries Doctor Kong, slapping him across the face. “We
can do it! We have to explore this mystery of death!”</p><p><br></p><p>“DEATH?” screeches Mind, and he faints again into the plate of cream
cakes.</p><p><br></p><p>Half an hour later, at the Vienna airport, Doctor Krazy Karl Kong is
dragging Doctor Sigfried Mind by the collar onto the plane bound for
Cairo.</p><p><br></p><p>“Come on, Mind!” cries Krazy Kong, huffing and puffing. “We have made
it this far, we have got to see those mummies!”</p><p><br></p><p>“MUMMIES?” screeches Sigfried, falling in a faint on top of Nellie
Knickers, the stewardess.</p><p><br></p><p>Kong and Nellie drag Mind to his seat, and strap him down. The plane
takes off, and three hours later, arrives in the Land of the Pyramids.
Kong carries the babbling Doctor Mind to the herd of rented camels,
which are waiting to take them to the pharaohs’ tombs.</p><p><br></p><p>Doctor Kong shouts out to their guide, Abdul Babul, “Take us to the
mummies!”</p><p><br></p><p>“MUMMIES?” screeches Mind, fainting and falling straight off his
camel, nose first, into a sand dune.</p><p><br></p><p>Two days later, the famous psychoanalysts and their camels arrive at
the huge pyramids. Doctor Kong jumps down, lights a torch, grabs Doctor
Mind by the collar, and starts dragging him into the dark, mysterious
crypts.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, in the darkness, Doctor Kong trips over something. “What is
that?” screeches Mind.</p><p>“Ah! It is alright – it is only a dead cat!” exclaims Doctor Kong.
“DEATH!” screeches Mind. And he falls over in a cold faint.</p><p>“Pull yourself together, Doctor!” shouts Kong. “We are almost
there!”</p><p><br></p><p>And Kong grabs Sigfried by the shoe, and drags him feet first towards
a huge golden coffin. “Stand up!” cries Doctor Kong, propping Mind up
against the wall, and handing him the burning torch.</p><p><br></p><p>Then Krazy Karl Kong bends over and lifts back the heavy, creaking
coffin lid. The lid falls to the ground with a loud crash, and when the
dust clears, Doctor Kong is left standing with his mouth wide open,
gazing at the spooky sight before his eyes.</p><p>He turns and grabs the frozen Doctor Mind by the collar and pulls his
face down into the coffin. “There!” shouts Kong, in triumph. “This is a
MUMMY!”</p><p>“MUMMY?” screeches Sigfried. But he just stares in disbelief, with
his eyes popping out. “MUMMY?” he screeches again. “Hey, this looks more
like daddy!”</p><p>It is time, Nivedano... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano...
(Drumbeat)</p><p>Be silent... Close your eyes... and feel yourself completely frozen.
This is the right moment to enter inwards.</p><p>Gather all your energy, your total consciousness, and rush towards
the inner center with deep intensity and urgency.</p><p><br></p><p>The center is just two inches below the navel, inside the body.
Faster... and faster... Deeper... and deeper...</p><p>As you come closer to the center of being, a great silence descends
over you, and inside a peace, a blissfulness, a light that fills your
whole interior. This is your original being. This is your buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>At this moment, witness that you are not the body, not the mind, not
the heart, but just the pure witnessing self, the pure consciousness.
This is your buddhahood, your hidden nature, your meeting with the
universe. These are your roots.</p><p><br></p><p>Relax... Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Relax... and just be a silent witness.</p><p><br></p><p>You start melting like ice in the ocean. Gautama the Buddha
Auditorium becomes an oceanic field of consciousness. You are no longer
separate – this is your oneness with existence.</p><p><br></p><p>To be one with existence is to be a buddha, it is your very nature.
It is not a question of searching and finding, you are it, right
now.</p><p>Gather all the flowers, the fragrance, the flame and the fire, the
immeasurable, and bring it with you as you come back.</p><p><br></p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Come back peacefully, silently, as a buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>Just for a few seconds close your eyes and remember the path and the
source you have found, and the buddha nature that you have
experienced.</p><p><br></p><p>This moment you are the most blessed people on the earth. Remembering
yourself as a buddha is the most precious experience, because it is your
eternity, it is your immortality.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not you, it is your very existence. You are one with the stars
and the trees and the sky and the ocean. You are no longer separate.</p><p><br></p><p>The last word of Buddha was, sammasati. Remember that you are a
buddha – sammasati. Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part10>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_psychology_of_the_esoteric/part11/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>11 Right questioning</span>

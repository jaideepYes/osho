DOING THINGS THAT ARE GIVEN BY OTHERS IS DUALISM OF MIND AND MATTER. AND IF YOU ARE IN THE DUALISM OF SUBJECT AND OBJECT, VARIOUS VIEWS ARISE. BUT THIS IS BLIND WISDOM, SO IT IS NOT YET THE TAO.\n“IF OTHERS DON’T GIVE YOU ANYTHING, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING. THAT’S WHY BODHIDHARMA SAID, ‘ORIGINALLY, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING.’\n“YOU SEE, WHEN A BABY COMES OUT OF THE WOMB, DOES HE READ SUTRAS OR NOT? AT THAT TIME, THE BABY DOESN’T KNOW WHETHER SUCH A THING AS BUDDHA NATURE EXISTS OR NOT.

THE TIME OF A BABY’S GURGLE IS COMPARED TO A SEEKER WHEN HE LEAVES THE MIND OF DIVIDING\n135\nAND CHOOSING. THAT’S WHY A BABY IS PRAISED. BUT IF YOU TAKE THIS COMPARISON AND SAY, ‘THE BABY IS THE WAY,’ PEOPLE OF THE PRESENT DAYS WILL UNDERSTAND IT WRONGLY.”\nFriends,\nFirst, the questions from the sannyasins. Question 1\nThe first question:\nI HEARD YOU SAY THAT THE CENTER OF OUR BUDDHAHOOD IS AT THE ‘HARA’ POINT INSIDE THE BODY.\nIS THERE ALSO A SLEEPING BUDDHA ENERGY IN OUR HEARTS AND IN THE THIRD EYE? DO WE ALL HAVE THE SAME POTENTIAL OF REMEMBERING, EACH ONE WITH HIS OR HER UNIQUE EXPRESSION OF CREATIVITY?\nPLEASE COMMENT.\nThe hara center is the source of all your energy. It can grow just like a tree grows from the roots into different branches.\nAccording to a different calculation of Patanjali, the energy can be divided into seven centers, but the original source remains the hara. From the hara it can go up.\nThe seventh center is in the head, and the sixth center is what you call the third eye. The fifth center is in our throat, and the fourth center is exactly in the middle: the heart. Below the heart there are three centers, above the heart there are three centers. But all these seven centers grow like a tree from the original source of the hara. That’s why, in Japanese, suicide is called hara-kiri. People don’t cut their throats, they don’t cut their heads. They simply pierce a small knife into the hara center – just exactly two inches below the navel – and the person dies. And you will not know at all that somebody has committed suicide. Just the energy is released from the body, the source is opened.\nI am trying to take you to the very original source. From there, it is up to you to bring your energy into any center you want.\nBetween the first center, the hara, and the seventh center in the head, the energy can move just like the energy moves into different branches of a tree – from the roots to the uppermost flowering. The hara is the source. When it blossoms, it reaches suddenly to the seventh center, piercing your heart, your throat, and at the seventh center it blossoms as a lotus. Man is also a flowering tree.\nThese are different ways of looking at things. Patanjali’s yoga is one of the ways; Zen is a totally different approach. To me, Zen seems to be more scientific, while Patanjali seems to be more intellectual and philosophical. Zen begins from the very source.\nThe buddha is not lying anywhere else other than in the hara; he is not lying in the heart. The energy can be brought to the heart, then the expression will be love. The energy can be brought to the third eye, then you will be able to see things which are not ordinarily visible – auras of people, auras of things, a certain kind of X-ray energy that goes deeper into things. If the same energy moves into the seventh center, according to Patanjali, samadhi is attained – you become enlightened.\nBut these are different calculations. Rather than talking about samadhi, I would rather encourage you to enter into the source of energy from where everything is going to happen. I don’t like to talk about the flowers much, because that talk will remain simply conceptual. My approach is more pragmatic.\nI want you to experience your sleeping energy. And the moment you reach there, it awakens. It sleeps only if you are not there. If your awareness reaches to the source, it wakes up, and in its waking is the buddhahood. In its waking you become for the first time part of existence: no ego, no self, a pure nothingness.\nPeople are afraid of the word ‘nothingness’. In the second question that fear is clear. Question 2\nThe second question is:\nTHOUGH YOU HAVE INFUSED THE SUTRAS WITH LIFE AND HUMOR, FOR ME, ZEN REMAINS THE STARK BEAUTY OF THE DESERT, AND I LONG FOR SOMETHING ELSE.\nWHY CAN’T I DROP THE IDEA THAT MY WAY IS NOT VIA EMPTINESS, BUT FULLNESS? I STILL CARRY THIS LONGING FOR SOME KIND OF UNION, A MELTING OUTWARDS RATHER THAN DISSOLVING INTO NOTHINGNESS INSIDE.\nWith whom are you going to melt outside? You don’t know even who you are. And who has told you that Zen is a “stark beauty of the desert”? Zen is perhaps the most beautiful path, full of flowers, songs, joy and laughter.\nBut the idea of nothingness creates a certain fear of dissolving into a desert. It is just your mind that makes the difference between emptiness and fullness. In realizing either, you will be realizing the other too, because they are two aspects of one thing, of one phenomenon which can either be called nothingness, or can be called fullness.\nZen has chosen rightly to call it nothingness, because fullness can give you misunderstandings. The moment you think of fullness you start imagining. The moment you think of melting into someone outside, immediately a God, a paradise, a heaven, and all kinds of imaginations arise. And those imaginations will prevent you from going anywhere.\nI am not helping your imagination at all. I am trying to uproot your imagination in every possible way. I want to leave you without images, in utter silence, in nothingness, because that is the only way to attain fullness.\nWhen the dewdrop disappears in the ocean, it is not that it becomes nothing. Yes, it becomes nothing but it also becomes the ocean. In its disappearing as a dewdrop, on the other side it is also becoming the whole ocean. So the fullness and nothingness are not two things, only two concepts of the mind, but in reality, only two ways of saying one thing. Emptiness, or nothingness, is better because it does not allow any imagination to arise.\nFullness is dangerous. If rightly used there is no problem. Fullness will also dissolve God, and paradise, and heaven and hell, and incarnation. But mind is capable of using the idea of fullness in a way that it cannot use the word ‘nothingness’. To prevent the mind from using the word ‘fullness’ and preventing you from realizing the reality, from Gautam Buddha onwards the word ‘nothingness’ has been chosen. But nothingness is not absence; nothingness is not dead. Nothingness is fullness, but so full that you cannot define it, and you cannot make a limit or a boundary to it.\nUnbounded fullness and nothingness, in experience, mean exactly the same. But for the beginner, the word ‘fullness’ is dangerous – and everybody is a beginner.\nBegin with something which is less capable of taking you astray from reality. Fullness can be used only by a master who knows that nothingness and fullness are synonymous. But for the beginner it is dangerous, because for him fullness means something opposed to nothingness. If ‘fullness’ is synonymous with ‘nothingness’, then there is no problem. Then the desert becomes the ocean, then there is only beauty and song and dance.\nNothingness gives the idea to the mind that everything will be lost. You will be lost, but the truth is, the moment everything is lost, including you, you have gained the whole universe – all the stars within you, and the vast universe inside your heart. It is not losing anything, so don’t be worried about nothing.\nThe questioner goes on:\nIS THIS JUST MY REFUSAL TO GROW UP? AM I FOOLING MYSELF? ARE WE ALL TO EMBRACE THE ZEN MANIFESTO NO MATTER WHAT ‘TYPE’ WE FEEL WE ARE?\nThere is no question of type. All types are just superficial. At the innermost core there is only one existence. The Zen Manifesto is not for a particular type, it is for all – for men and for women, and for black and white, and for Hindu and Mohammedan, and for Christian and Buddhist. It does not matter what kind of conditioning you have been brought up in, Zen is simply a technique of entering into your veryness. The entrance is so deep that nothing remains, and all is found.\nGurdjieff has written a book, ALL AND NOTHING. I would like to withdraw the word ‘and’, because all is nothing; there is no question of and. Whatever type you are – introvert, extrovert – it does not matter, you are all part of the same existence. And when you relax into existence, all your differences disappear, only oneness remains. You can call that oneness whatever you like, but basically it is nothingness. You can give it any color, you can call it by any name, but don’t start calling it by another name from the beginning, because that can take you astray. Somebody may think that he can call it God, then he will start worshipping a God which is man manufactured.\nFor the beginner, nothing is the most secure path to avoid the mind playing games. Nothing is beyond the reaches of the mind, so it cannot play games with it. But anything else you name it, mind is capable of playing games with it.\nThe whole effort of meditation is not to allow the mind to play games. It has been playing games for centuries. One has to come to the point of seeing all the games of the mind: all the gods, all the messiahs, all the prophets, all the religions, all the philosophies.\nExistence is available to a silent being, not to the learned, not to the well informed, not to the scholar. It is available to the innocent, and meditation is a way of becoming innocent again. Getting back your childhood, being reborn, knowing nothing, a silence, a joy, a blissfulness arises which is indestructible, which is eternal.\nQuestion 3\nThe third question:\nTHE OTHER NIGHT I HEARD YOU SAY THERE IS NO REINCARNATION, NO SOUL, NO SPIRIT AFTER DEATH, ONLY PURE CONSCIOUSNESS, PURE SILENCE.\nIS IT THEN SO, THAT PART OF US, OF OUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS, IS AWARE OF THAT ENDLESS SILENCE, OF BEING PART OF THE WHOLE?\nAll your questions arise out of your mind, and I am trying to take you beyond the mind. Beyond the mind there is no question, there is nobody to ask. But if you start thinking about meditation, that is not meditation. If you start thinking, “What happens when awareness witnesses the wholeness of existence?” – if you start thinking, you are moving inside the mind in a circle, in a vicious circle, you may find some answer, but that answer is not the truth.\nYou have to go beyond thinking, beyond questioning. Just be silent and you will know.\nYou are not, only the universe is.\nYou are just a ripple in the river, arisen in a certain moment and dissolved back again, but not for a single moment separate from the river. This whole existence is nothing but a vast ocean in which all kinds of ripples, tidal waves, arise and disappear, and the ocean remains.\nThat which remains is your authentic reality. That which comes and goes is just a dream, or just a phenomenal, illusory reality. For a moment the tidal wave can think, “I am separate from the ocean.” But you know, however the wave may be tidal, it is not separate from the ocean. Even when it is thinking it is separate – and it looks separate – deep down it is part of the ocean.\nI am taking you deep down into the ocean. In that ocean nobody is separate. Suddenly a tremendous joy arises that you are eternal, that you are oceanic, that you have always been and you will always be... but not those small personalities that you have taken again and again. This time you stop taking personalities and simply become the whole.\nThe whole feels more cozy than nothingness, but they are simply two ways of saying the same thing. The whole appears cozy, it seems you are becoming more than you were before. And nothing\nseems dangerous – you are becoming even less than you were before. You were at least something, now you are becoming nothing. But becoming whole, you have to become nothing. Becoming part of this vast existence, you have to relax the separateness, the individuality.\nThe questioner goes on asking:\nDOES THE DEWDROP STILL FEEL OR EXPERIENCE SOME ALIVENESS INSIDE, WHEN FIRST IT MELTS INTO THE OCEAN?\nThe dewdrop disappearing into the ocean feels for the first time a vast life. Only the boundaries that were making it a small dewdrop have disappeared. The dewdrop is still there, but it is no longer a dewdrop, it has become the ocean.\nI have told you about Kabir, one of the most important mystics of the East.…\nWhen he became enlightened he wrote down a small statement: “The dewdrop has disappeared into the ocean – BUND SAMANI SAMUND MEIN.” But before dying, he called his son Kamal, and told him, “Please correct it. It was my first experience, now I know better. The dewdrop has not entered into the ocean; on the contrary, the ocean has entered into the dewdrop. So write it down that the ocean has entered into the dewdrop.”\nBoth mean the same, but one is the experience of the beginner. The dewdrop disappearing into the ocean feels like you are going into a vast nothingness. But once you have reached into that vastness, when you are no more, suddenly that vastness is you. There will be no self, no sense of I, but a sense of totality, of wholeness.\nIt is difficult to bring it into language. That difficulty is shown in Kabir’s changing the statement. In fact, no statement is right. Whether you say the dewdrop has entered into the ocean, or you say the ocean has entered into the dewdrop, you are still talking of two things: the dewdrop and the ocean.\nIf I had been present there, I would have said, “It is better to cancel both. Whatever has happened has happened, nothing can be said about it. One thing is certain, there is no more separation. So what has entered into what does not matter. There have been two, now there are not two.”\nThe sutra:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nGYOZAN SAID TO SEKISHITSU, “TELL ME WHAT TO BELIEVE IN AND WHAT TO RELY ON?” SEKISHITSU GESTURED ACROSS THE SKY ABOVE, THREE TIMES WITH HIS HAND, AND\nSAID, “THERE IS NO SUCH THING in which you can believe, on which you can rely. THERE IS NO SUCH THING.”\nWhat does he mean by gesturing three times to the sky?\nExistence is just a vast sky with no end and no beginning, no boundary. There is nothing to believe and nothing to rely on. One has just to disappear. All belief is man manufactured, and all reliance,\nrelying on a God or relying on a Christ, is out of your own fear. But there is nothing to rely on, and there is no security.\nDon’t cling with anything. Everything that you cling to is your own imagination. Your gods are your imagination, and your philosophies are your imagination. Existence has no gods, and existence has no philosophies – just a pure silence, but a silence which is musical, a silence which is a dance; a silence which blossoms into many flowers, and into many fragrances; a silence which manifests into immense varieties; a silence which is multidimensional. Just relax into it. Don’t try to believe or trust, because all belief and trust is clinging.\nSEKISHITSU GESTURED ACROSS THE SKY ABOVE, THREE TIMES WITH HIS HAND, AND\nSAID, “THERE IS NO SUCH THING... You just please drop the very idea of relying on anything, or believing in anything. Just relax. This whole existence is yours. Why do you want to cling to a special part? It is all the same – the same sky, the same silence, the same purity, same innocence.”\nGYOZAN ASKED, “WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT READING SUTRAS?”\nMan wants something. His mind is always finding some way to avoid the nothingness or the wholeness of existence.\nGyozan immediately asked, “If there is nothing to believe and nothing to rely upon, what do you say about reading sutras?”\nSEKISHITSU REPLIED, “ALL THE SUTRAS ARE OUT OF THE QUESTION. DOING THINGS THAT ARE GIVEN BY OTHERS IS DUALISM OF MIND AND MATTER. AND IF YOU ARE IN THE DUALISM OF SUBJECT AND OBJECT, VARIOUS VIEWS ARISE. BUT THIS IS BLIND WISDOM, SO IT IS NOT YET THE TAO.\n“IF OTHERS DON’T GIVE YOU ANYTHING, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING...”\nHave you ever thought about it? – that all that you know has been given to you by others. If you put that aside to sort out what is yours, you will find a pure emptiness is yours, everything else has been given to you by others. Then who are you? – a pure emptiness hidden behind all those words and beliefs and religions which have been given to you.\n“IF OTHERS DON’T GIVE YOU ANYTHING, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING. THAT’S WHY BODHIDHARMA SAID, ‘ORIGINALLY, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING.’”\nBodhidharma’s statement is of tremendous value. There is not a single thing separate from the whole. All separation, all dualism, is the game of the mind. As the mind becomes silent, all that game disappears, all those players are no longer there.\nWhat happens when you wake up in the morning to your dreams? In the dreams have you ever doubted that what you are seeing is not true? Nobody in a dream can doubt. Whatever appears in the dream, appears to be the right thing at the moment. Only in the morning when you wake up, suddenly do you realize that all the night you have been dreaming of things which were not true, which were just mind creations, flowers in the sky – Bodhidharma’s statement, “ORIGINALLY, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING.”\n“YOU SEE, WHEN A BABY COMES OUT OF THE WOMB, DOES HE READ SUTRAS OR NOT? AT THAT TIME, THE BABY DOES NOT KNOW WHETHER SUCH A THING AS BUDDHA NATURE EXISTS OR NOT. AS HE GROWS UP AND LEARNS VARIOUS VIEWS, HE APPEARS TO THE WORLD AND SAYS, ‘I DO WELL AND I UNDERSTAND.’ BUT HE DOESN’T KNOW IT IS RUBBISH AND DELUSION.\n“OF THE SIXTEEN WAYS OR PHASES OF DOING, A BABY’S WAY IS THE BEST. THE TIME OF A BABY’S GURGLE IS COMPARED TO A SEEKER WHEN HE LEAVES THE MIND OF DIVIDING AND CHOOSING. THAT’S WHY A BABY IS PRAISED. BUT IF YOU TAKE THIS COMPARISON AND SAY, ‘THE BABY IS THE WAY,’ PEOPLE OF THE PRESENT DAYS WILL UNDERSTAND IT WRONGLY.”\nAnd that is true even today.\nWhen I am saying to you, “Be nothing,” I am saying in other words, “Be just a newborn baby, a pure consciousness, undivided into knowing and not knowing. The baby’s consciousness is pure. It knows nothing, it does not even know that it is.”\nYou must have heard small babies talk about themselves as separate persons. They may say, “The baby is hungry. The baby is thirsty.” The “I” takes a little time to grow. It takes at least three to four years for society to create an ego so the baby starts saying “I” – instead of saying, “The baby” is hungry, “I” am hungry. And the moment the baby says, “I am hungry,” he is no longer a baby. He has entered into the world, he has graduated, in a way.\nBut according to Zen, once again you have to become just like the baby. This second childhood is the greatest revolution possible.\nJesus is right when he says, “Unless you are born again, you will not understand the truth.” He had been traveling for seventeen years in the East, and he had gathered much. And that was really the problem why Jews could not accept him. He was talking a language that was not theirs. He was making interpretations of the old Jewish tradition in a way that had never been heard and that he had brought from the East.\nAnd at that time the whole of the East was full of the vibrations of Gautam Buddha. Just five hundred years had passed since Gautam Buddha was alive, yet his vibrations were in the atmosphere. And there are possibilities that Jesus did not only visit India and Tibet. There is a place in Japan which also proclaims that he visited there. In the Bible these seventeen years are completely missing. They don’t listen to any other argument, because that would be disturbing to whatever they have managed up to now as their Holy Bible.\nJesus was much influenced by Buddha’s teachings. This teaching, “Unless you are born again,” has the flavor of Gautam Buddha who was continuously teaching that you have to drop everything that has been told to you, you have to forget everything that has been programmed in you. Gautam Buddha brings to the world the first deprogramming philosophy. And when you are deprogrammed completely, who are you? – just a pure nothingness, just a silence. All words were borrowed, all sutras were given to you, all religions were forced on your mind. You are not a Christian, and you are not a Hindu, and you are not a Mohammedan. You were born just as pure consciousness.\nYou have to attain that pure consciousness again. This is rebirth. And this rebirth brings the buddha, the pure consciousness, the consciousness which knows no boundaries; hence, it cannot call itself “I.” A consciousness which has become one with the whole has nothing to say.\nBuddha, when he became enlightened, for seven days remained silent, wondering whether to say it or not. “Because in every possible way,” he thought, “it will be misunderstood. It is better to be silent.” But a compassionate heart could not be at ease in silence, seeing that “Everybody needs this exploration, this excursion into himself. I know the way, if I remain silent it will be criminal. But if I say anything, then too, I will not be absolutely right in saying it, because that which is beyond the word cannot be brought into the word.”\nSo after seven days, compassion took over, and finally he tried. For forty-two years he went on saying to people, and always making it clear – “What I am saying, don’t take it literally. I want you to experience it. Only then will you understand the meaning of it – not by hearing me, but by experiencing it. Only by tasting it, will you know the sweetness of it.”\nBoncho wrote:\nRIVER.\nONE LONG LINE\nTHROUGH SNOWY FIELDS.\nLife is just a river, a long river – a long line through snowy fields. And then what happens? Each river, small or big, dissolves into the ocean, finds its way without any guide, without any sutras, without any masters. It may go astray, zigzag, but finally it reaches to the ocean. And that reaching to the ocean is becoming the ocean. That is the rebirth. That’s what we mean by meditation. That’s what we mean by the Zen Manifesto.\nEvery river is destined to disappear one day into the ocean. Go dancingly, go joyfully. There is no need to be worried, there is no need to be hurried. The ocean is waiting – you can take your time, but take your time with joy, not with tensions and anxieties. Rejoice and dance and sing and love, and finally you are going to disappear into the ocean. The ocean is always waiting for you.\nEven though you are far away from the ocean you are part of it, always reaching, always coming closer to the ocean. Everybody is going to become a buddha today or tomorrow – and there are only seven days in a week, so you can choose...!\nQuestion 4\nManeesha’s question:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nWILHELM REICH SAYS, IN HIS BOOK, ‘LISTEN, LITTLE MAN,’ THAT HE FOUND THAT MAN REACHES OUT WITH HIS LIFE ENERGY WHEN HE FEELS WELL AND LOVING; THAT HE\nRETRACTS THAT ENERGY WHEN HE IS AFRAID. REICH SAYS THAT HE FOUND THAT THIS LIFE ENERGY – WHICH HE TERMED “ORGONE” – IS “FOUND IN THE ATMOSPHERE,” OUTSIDE THE BODY. HE SAYS HE SUCCEEDED IN SEEING IT AND DEVISED APPARATUS WHICH MAGNIFIED IT.\nIS WHAT HE OBSERVED SO?\nManeesha, Wilhelm Reich was one of the unique intelligences born in this century. What he has found has been known to the East as aura.\nYou must have seen around the statues of Buddha or Mahavira or Krishna – a round aura around the head. That round aura is a reality. What Wilhelm Reich said was authentically true, but the people to whom he said it were not the right people to understand it. They thought he was mad because he described life as an energy surrounding the body. It is exactly true.\nLife is an energy that surrounds your body. Not only your body, but flowers, trees... everything has its own aura. And that aura, that energy surrounding you shrinks and expands, in different situations.\nAny situation where your energy shrinks, should be thought bad, sick. And every situation where your energy expands, should be respected and loved. In love your energy reaches out, you become more alive. And when you are in fear, your energy shrinks, you become less alive.\nNow, poor Wilhelm Reich was thought by Americans to be mad, because he was not only magnifying that energy – he had found a few exercises in which that energy magnifies – he was even catching that energy in boxes, big boxes in which a man could enter. And if the man was sick he would come out whole and healthy. Naturally such a man should be thought mad. He was selling those boxes, empty boxes – but they were not empty. He had found ways to collect the energy which is available in the atmosphere. Around a tree you can find that energy showering, but with your bare eyes you cannot see it.\nAfter he was declared mad and imprisoned, another man in the Soviet Union even managed to photograph it. And now it has become a recognized psychology in the Soviet Union, that life has an aura. And the man, Kirlian, has developed a certain sensitive plate to photograph it.\nHe would photograph the hand, and the hand would come with an aura around it. In a very strange way his photographs even showed if a man would be sick within six months: “Right now he does not show any pattern of sickness, but his aura is shrinking at a certain point...” And if at a certain point the aura is shrinking, maybe the person will become deaf, or blind if the aura around the eyes is shrinking. And all his photographs proved to be right. When he said, “This man is in danger of losing his eyesight,” there was no visible sign, there was no reason to believe it, but within six months that man became blind.\nNow in Soviet psychology, Kirlian photography is recognized by the government. It is spreading into other countries also.\nA man can be cured before he becomes sick. Kirlian photography is very predictive. It shows, at least six months ahead, what is going to happen.\nIn the East, it has been known for centuries that before your death – six months before – you stop being able to see the tip of your nose. Because your eyes start turning upwards, they cannot see the tip of your own nose. The moment you recognize you cannot see the tip of your nose means that within six months your energy will shrink, go back to its source. And the aura, without any photographic technology, has been recognized by yoga for five thousand years. But now, it can be accepted on scientific grounds.\nWilhelm Reich was a unique genius. He could manage to see and feel what is not ordinarily possible.\nBut if you are very meditative, you will start seeing the auras of people, even your own aura. You will see your own hand with the light rays around it, radiating. And when you are healthy you will feel your aura expanding. When you are sick you will feel your aura shrinking – something is shrinking within you.\nWhen you are by the side of a sick person, you will have a strange feeling that he somehow makes you feel sick, because the sick person exploits the auras of the other without his knowing. He needs more life, so whoever has life and comes around him – he takes his life.\nAnd you know by experience, without understanding, that there are people you want to avoid, because meeting them you feel sick, meeting them you feel that something has been taken away from you. And there are people you want to meet, because meeting them you feel an expanding, you feel more alive.\nWilhelm Reich was right, but unfortunately the masses never accept their own geniuses; on the contrary, they condemn them. Because if Wilhelm Reich is right, then everybody else is almost blind. And in anger he wrote the book, LISTEN, LITTLE MAN. But that book is beautiful, and his anger can be forgiven because he was mistreated by “the little man,” by the masses. He was first thought to be mad, then forced into a madhouse, and he died in a madhouse.\nIn the East, he would have become a Gautam Buddha. He had the quality, the insight. But a wrong society, a society of very little men, of very small people... small-minded, who cannot conceive the vast, who cannot conceive the mysterious.\nThe whole atmosphere is full of life. And if you understand your own sources of life, you will be suddenly aware that birds are alive, trees are alive, grasses are alive – everywhere there is life! And you can dance with this life, you can start having a dialogue with the atmosphere. Of course, people will think you are mad, because people are still the same. The same people crucified Jesus, the same people forced Wilhelm Reich into a madhouse, the same people poisoned Socrates... but those little people are in the majority.\nWilhelm Reich’s anger is right, but still I would say, rather than anger, the little man needs compassion. He was angry because they misbehaved with him, they destroyed his whole life. Rather than understanding him – he would have opened a new door to experiencing, to loving, to living – they destroyed the man completely. Obviously, he became angry.\nIn the East, the same little men are there, but the Eastern genius has never been angry with them. Rather than being angry, it has shown compassion, it has felt compassion for their blindness, and it has tried in every way to bring light to them, a little understanding to their hearts.\nIt is time for Sardar Gurudayal Singh.…\nThe Reverend Rump is very excited one afternoon when a new organ is delivered to his church. A large crowd of people gathers outside the church to watch as the organ is slowly lifted out of the delivery truck.\nSuddenly, one of the delivery men lets go of a rope and the organ starts to fall on top of the Reverend Rump, who is standing beneath it. But at the last moment, Hamish MacTavish pushes the vicar aside and stops the organ before it smashes on the ground.\n“Bless you, my son,” gasps Reverend Rump, picking himself up. “You saved me! When you come to church next Sunday, you can come and play on this new church organ!”\n“Ah!” sighs Hamish. “There is no need for me to go to church, Vicar.” “Really, my son?” asks Rump. “Why not?”\n“You see, Vicar,” replies Hamish, “I have a church of my own at home.” “Really?” asks the vicar. “What do you mean?”\n“Well,” explains Hamish. “It is like this. My whole family lives in one room, so we have a three-level bed. The kids are on the top level, singing all day like little angels. Then, on the middle level, there is my mother-in-law. She is preaching day and night, dealing out the Ten Commandments and the wrath of God. Then, on the bottom level, there is me and my wife – playing on my organ!”\nSwimming casually in the warm sea waters off the coast of Africa, are four huge sharks – Jaws, Toothy, Munch, and Little Belch. The conversation naturally turns to their favorite joy – eating.\n“The best food in the world is found just near Australia,” says Jaws, the biggest shark. “The menu is full of young, sporting people with tender muscles and skin well toasted by the sun.”\n“Ah, that is okay,” replies Toothy, the big white shark, “but an even better delicacy can be found off the Canary Islands. The beaches are packed with fat, oily German tourists. Just like butter melting on your tongue!”\n“Not bad,” interrupts Munch, the oldest shark. “In my long years of gobbling, I find the summer waters off Miami Beach to be the ultimate in dining pleasure. The place is filled with politicians with their giant livers soaked in rum or wine – and no backbones!”\nThen, old Munch turns to the youngster of the group, Little Belch. He hears a strange sound coming from Belch’s stomach, and asks, “Hey, kid! What is that noise coming out of your belly? Where have you been eating?”\n“Ah!” groans Belch, “I have got indigestion. I went for lunch yesterday off the beach at Goa – and the strange people I ate there will not stop singing and dancing!”\nMrs. Nora Bone gets a midnight telephone call from her son, Billy, who just got married that afternoon and is staying at the Swelling Sausage Honeymoon Hotel.\n“Mom,” sobs Billy, tearfully down the phone, “we are having some problems in the bedroom!” “What kind of problems, Billy?” asks Nora Bone, anxiously.\n“Well, Mom,” moans Billy, “Nellie is lying there on the bed, naked and breathing hard.… And, well... Gee, Mom – I don’t know what to do!”\n“It is quite simple, Billy,” snaps Nora Bone, in her best motherly voice, “you just take down your pants and put the hardest part of your body in the place where Nellie, your wife, you know... where she wee-wees!”\n“Ah, I get it!” cries Billy. “Gee, thanks, Mom!” – and he puts down the phone.\nMrs. Nora Bone sighs deeply, shakes her head and goes back to bed. But fifteen minutes later, the phone rings again. This time it is Nellie Bone, her new daughter-in-law.\n“What is the matter now?” snaps Mrs. Nora Bone.\n“It is your son, Billy!” cries Nellie. “He has got his head stuck down the toilet!” Nivedano...\n(Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat) Be silent...\nClose your eyes... and feel your bodies to be completely frozen. This is the right moment to enter in.\nGather all your energies, your total consciousness, and rush towards the center of your being, just two inches below the navel inside you – the hara center – with an urgency as if this is the last moment of your life.\nFaster and faster... Deeper and deeper...\nAs you are coming close to the center of your being, a great silence descends over you, and a peace that you have never known, and a light fills your whole interior.\nFrom the very center you can do one thing which is not possible otherwise – witnessing. Witness that you are not the body.\nWitness that you are not the mind.\nWitness that you are only a witnessing consciousness, a pure consciousness, eternal, immortal. This is your being and everybody’s being.\nTo deepen this witnessing, Nivedano...\n(Drumbeat)\nRelax... but remember the source of hara – the very source of your life – and flowers will start showering on you.\nYou are melting into a consciousness which is vaster than you. Gautama the Buddha Auditorium has become an ocean of consciousness. Ten thousand buddhas are no longer ten thousand, but a single, a non-dual, pure consciousness without any ripples in it.\nThis is your buddha nature. Out of this buddha nature arises all ecstasy, all blessings, all blissfulness.\nThis is only an experiment – it has to become your very life. You have to be a buddha around the clock, alert, aware, compassionate, loving, rejoicing in life, expanding life, making it a dance.\nZen is not a renunciation, it is a rejoicing.\nIt is the manifesto of dance and celebration.\nCollect all these experiences which are happening inside you, you have to bring them to your everyday life. And ask the flame, which is symbolized by the face of Gautam Buddha, to come behind you. The face of Gautam Buddha is everybody’s original face. It will come behind you. It has been waiting for you to request it.\nFirst, it will come following you. Soon you will find you are following it. And at the third stage, the final stage, you will disappear, only the buddha remains.\nThe buddha is your nothingness, and it is your fullness. It is your wholeness. You can call it any name, but remember it is universal. It has nothing to do with you and me.\nNivedano... (Drumbeat)\nCome back... but come back as buddhas – silent, peacefully, with a grace, and a beauty.\nJust for a few moments, remember where you have been, the space that you entered, the center than you touched, the flame that you have seen.\nSlowly slowly, meditation becomes your very life, your very heartbeat. That day is the most blessed day when you don’t have to meditate – you are meditation. Your very being, whatever you are doing or not doing, is silent, peaceful, loving, alert and aware of its eternity.\nThis experience is the only sacred experience. This experience brings back again your childhood, a pure silent consciousness, rejoicing in everything that it does. The whole universe becomes a celebration and life is no longer a misery. Every moment existence is available for you to rejoice, sing, dance, love, and expand your life energies.\nMind only thinks, meditation lives. Mind is a very small thing.\nMeditation is as vast as the whole universe.\nI teach you the vastness, I teach you universality, I teach you eternity.\nYou are not what you appear in the mirror, you are much more. You are vast, as vast as the whole universe.\nThis declaration is the Zen Manifesto. Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6686","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_zen_manifesto_freedom_from_oneself/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_zen_manifesto_freedom_from_oneself/>The Zen Manifesto.

RELY ON?”</p><p><br></p><p>SEKISHITSU GESTURED ACROSS THE SKY ABOVE, THREE TIMES WITH HIS HAND,
AND SAID, “THERE IS NO SUCH THING.”</p><p><br></p><p>GYOZAN ASKED, “WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT READING SUTRAS?”</p><p><br></p><p>SEKISHITSU REPLIED, “ALL THE SUTRAS ARE OUT OF THE QUESTION. DOING
THINGS THAT ARE GIVEN BY OTHERS IS DUALISM OF MIND AND MATTER. AND IF
YOU ARE IN THE DUALISM OF SUBJECT AND OBJECT, VARIOUS VIEWS ARISE. BUT
THIS IS BLIND WISDOM, SO IT IS NOT YET THE TAO.</p><p><br></p><p>“IF OTHERS DON’T GIVE YOU ANYTHING, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING.
THAT’S WHY BODHIDHARMA SAID, ‘ORIGINALLY, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE
THING.’</p><p><br></p><p>“YOU SEE, WHEN A BABY COMES OUT OF THE WOMB, DOES HE READ SUTRAS OR
NOT? AT THAT TIME, THE BABY DOESN’T KNOW WHETHER SUCH A THING AS BUDDHA
NATURE EXISTS OR NOT. AS HE GROWS UP AND LEARNS VARIOUS VIEWS, HE
APPEARS TO THE WORLD AND SAYS, ‘I DO WELL AND I UNDERSTAND.’ BUT HE
DOESN’T KNOW IT IS RUBBISH AND DELUSION.</p><p><br></p><p>“OF THE SIXTEEN WAYS OR PHASES OF DOING, A BABY’S WAY IS THE BEST.
THE TIME OF A BABY’S GURGLE IS COMPARED TO A SEEKER WHEN HE LEAVES THE
MIND OF DIVIDING</p><p><br></p><p>135</p><p>AND CHOOSING. THAT’S WHY A BABY IS PRAISED. BUT IF YOU TAKE THIS
COMPARISON AND SAY, ‘THE BABY IS THE WAY,’ PEOPLE OF THE PRESENT DAYS
WILL UNDERSTAND IT WRONGLY.”</p><p><br></p><p>Friends,</p><p><br></p><p>First, the questions from the sannyasins. Question 1</p><p>The first question:</p><p><br></p><p>I HEARD YOU SAY THAT THE CENTER OF OUR BUDDHAHOOD IS AT THE ‘HARA’
POINT INSIDE THE BODY.</p><p><br></p><p>IS THERE ALSO A SLEEPING BUDDHA ENERGY IN OUR HEARTS AND IN THE THIRD
EYE? DO WE ALL HAVE THE SAME POTENTIAL OF REMEMBERING, EACH ONE WITH HIS
OR HER UNIQUE EXPRESSION OF CREATIVITY?</p><p><br></p><p>PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>The hara center is the source of all your energy. It can grow just
like a tree grows from the roots into different branches.</p><p><br></p><p>According to a different calculation of Patanjali, the energy can be
divided into seven centers, but the original source remains the hara.
From the hara it can go up.</p><p><br></p><p>The seventh center is in the head, and the sixth center is what you
call the third eye. The fifth center is in our throat, and the fourth
center is exactly in the middle: the heart. Below the heart there are
three centers, above the heart there are three centers. But all these
seven centers grow like a tree from the original source of the hara.
That’s why, in Japanese, suicide is called hara-kiri. People don’t cut
their throats, they don’t cut their heads. They simply pierce a small
knife into the hara center – just exactly two inches below the navel –
and the person dies. And you will not know at all that somebody has
committed suicide. Just the energy is released from the body, the source
is opened.</p><p><br></p><p>I am trying to take you to the very original source. From there, it
is up to you to bring your energy into any center you want.</p><p><br></p><p>Between the first center, the hara, and the seventh center in the
head, the energy can move just like the energy moves into different
branches of a tree – from the roots to the uppermost flowering. The hara
is the source. When it blossoms, it reaches suddenly to the seventh
center, piercing your heart, your throat, and at the seventh center it
blossoms as a lotus. Man is also a flowering tree.</p><p><br></p><p>These are different ways of looking at things. Patanjali’s yoga is
one of the ways; Zen is a totally different approach. To me, Zen seems
to be more scientific, while Patanjali seems to be more intellectual and
philosophical. Zen begins from the very source.</p><p>The buddha is not lying anywhere else other than in the hara; he is
not lying in the heart. The energy can be brought to the heart, then the
expression will be love. The energy can be brought to the third eye,
then you will be able to see things which are not ordinarily visible –
auras of people, auras of things, a certain kind of X-ray energy that
goes deeper into things. If the same energy moves into the seventh
center, according to Patanjali, samadhi is attained – you become
enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>But these are different calculations. Rather than talking about
samadhi, I would rather encourage you to enter into the source of energy
from where everything is going to happen. I don’t like to talk about the
flowers much, because that talk will remain simply conceptual. My
approach is more pragmatic.</p><p><br></p><p>I want you to experience your sleeping energy. And the moment you
reach there, it awakens. It sleeps only if you are not there. If your
awareness reaches to the source, it wakes up, and in its waking is the
buddhahood. In its waking you become for the first time part of
existence: no ego, no self, a pure nothingness.</p><p><br></p><p>People are afraid of the word ‘nothingness’. In the second question
that fear is clear. Question 2</p><p>The second question is:</p><p><br></p><p>THOUGH YOU HAVE INFUSED THE SUTRAS WITH LIFE AND HUMOR, FOR ME, ZEN
REMAINS THE STARK BEAUTY OF THE DESERT, AND I LONG FOR SOMETHING
ELSE.</p><p><br></p><p>WHY CAN’T I DROP THE IDEA THAT MY WAY IS NOT VIA EMPTINESS, BUT
FULLNESS? I STILL CARRY THIS LONGING FOR SOME KIND OF UNION, A MELTING
OUTWARDS RATHER THAN DISSOLVING INTO NOTHINGNESS INSIDE.</p><p><br></p><p>With whom are you going to melt outside? You don’t know even who you
are. And who has told you that Zen is a “stark beauty of the desert”?
Zen is perhaps the most beautiful path, full of flowers, songs, joy and
laughter.</p><p><br></p><p>But the idea of nothingness creates a certain fear of dissolving into
a desert. It is just your mind that makes the difference between
emptiness and fullness. In realizing either, you will be realizing the
other too, because they are two aspects of one thing, of one phenomenon
which can either be called nothingness, or can be called fullness.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen has chosen rightly to call it nothingness, because fullness can
give you misunderstandings. The moment you think of fullness you start
imagining. The moment you think of melting into someone outside,
immediately a God, a paradise, a heaven, and all kinds of imaginations
arise. And those imaginations will prevent you from going anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not helping your imagination at all. I am trying to uproot your
imagination in every possible way. I want to leave you without images,
in utter silence, in nothingness, because that is the only way to attain
fullness.</p><p>When the dewdrop disappears in the ocean, it is not that it becomes
nothing. Yes, it becomes nothing but it also becomes the ocean. In its
disappearing as a dewdrop, on the other side it is also becoming the
whole ocean. So the fullness and nothingness are not two things, only
two concepts of the mind, but in reality, only two ways of saying one
thing. Emptiness, or nothingness, is better because it does not allow
any imagination to arise.</p><p>Fullness is dangerous. If rightly used there is no problem. Fullness
will also dissolve God, and paradise, and heaven and hell, and
incarnation. But mind is capable of using the idea of fullness in a way
that it cannot use the word ‘nothingness’. To prevent the mind from
using the word ‘fullness’ and preventing you from realizing the reality,
from Gautam Buddha onwards the word ‘nothingness’ has been chosen. But
nothingness is not absence; nothingness is not dead. Nothingness is
fullness, but so full that you cannot define it, and you cannot make a
limit or a boundary to it.</p><p>Unbounded fullness and nothingness, in experience, mean exactly the
same. But for the beginner, the word ‘fullness’ is dangerous – and
everybody is a beginner.</p><p>Begin with something which is less capable of taking you astray from
reality. Fullness can be used only by a master who knows that
nothingness and fullness are synonymous. But for the beginner it is
dangerous, because for him fullness means something opposed to
nothingness. If ‘fullness’ is synonymous with ‘nothingness’, then there
is no problem. Then the desert becomes the ocean, then there is only
beauty and song and dance.</p><p>Nothingness gives the idea to the mind that everything will be lost.
You will be lost, but the truth is, the moment everything is lost,
including you, you have gained the whole universe – all the stars within
you, and the vast universe inside your heart. It is not losing anything,
so don’t be worried about nothing.</p><p>The questioner goes on:</p><p><br></p><p>IS THIS JUST MY REFUSAL TO GROW UP? AM I FOOLING MYSELF? ARE WE ALL
TO EMBRACE THE ZEN MANIFESTO NO MATTER WHAT ‘TYPE’ WE FEEL WE ARE?</p><p>There is no question of type. All types are just superficial. At the
innermost core there is only one existence. The Zen Manifesto is not for
a particular type, it is for all – for men and for women, and for black
and white, and for Hindu and Mohammedan, and for Christian and Buddhist.
It does not matter what kind of conditioning you have been brought up
in, Zen is simply a technique of entering into your veryness. The
entrance is so deep that nothing remains, and all is found.</p><p>Gurdjieff has written a book, ALL AND NOTHING. I would like to
withdraw the word ‘and’, because all is nothing; there is no question of
and. Whatever type you are – introvert, extrovert – it does not matter,
you are all part of the same existence. And when you relax into
existence, all your differences disappear, only oneness remains. You can
call that oneness whatever you like, but basically it is nothingness.
You can give it any color, you can call it by any name, but don’t start
calling it by another name from the beginning, because that can take you
astray. Somebody may think that he can call it God, then he will start
worshipping a God which is man manufactured.</p><p>For the beginner, nothing is the most secure path to avoid the mind
playing games. Nothing is beyond the reaches of the mind, so it cannot
play games with it. But anything else you name it, mind is capable of
playing games with it.</p><p>The whole effort of meditation is not to allow the mind to play
games. It has been playing games for centuries. One has to come to the
point of seeing all the games of the mind: all the gods, all the
messiahs, all the prophets, all the religions, all the philosophies.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence is available to a silent being, not to the learned, not to
the well informed, not to the scholar. It is available to the innocent,
and meditation is a way of becoming innocent again. Getting back your
childhood, being reborn, knowing nothing, a silence, a joy, a
blissfulness arises which is indestructible, which is eternal.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>THE OTHER NIGHT I HEARD YOU SAY THERE IS NO REINCARNATION, NO SOUL,
NO SPIRIT AFTER DEATH, ONLY PURE CONSCIOUSNESS, PURE SILENCE.</p><p><br></p><p>IS IT THEN SO, THAT PART OF US, OF OUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS, IS AWARE OF
THAT ENDLESS SILENCE, OF BEING PART OF THE WHOLE?</p><p><br></p><p>All your questions arise out of your mind, and I am trying to take
you beyond the mind. Beyond the mind there is no question, there is
nobody to ask. But if you start thinking about meditation, that is not
meditation. If you start thinking, “What happens when awareness
witnesses the wholeness of existence?” – if you start thinking, you are
moving inside the mind in a circle, in a vicious circle, you may find
some answer, but that answer is not the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to go beyond thinking, beyond questioning. Just be silent
and you will know.</p><p>You are not, only the universe is.</p><p><br></p><p>You are just a ripple in the river, arisen in a certain moment and
dissolved back again, but not for a single moment separate from the
river. This whole existence is nothing but a vast ocean in which all
kinds of ripples, tidal waves, arise and disappear, and the ocean
remains.</p><p><br></p><p>That which remains is your authentic reality. That which comes and
goes is just a dream, or just a phenomenal, illusory reality. For a
moment the tidal wave can think, “I am separate from the ocean.” But you
know, however the wave may be tidal, it is not separate from the ocean.
Even when it is thinking it is separate – and it looks separate – deep
down it is part of the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>I am taking you deep down into the ocean. In that ocean nobody is
separate. Suddenly a tremendous joy arises that you are eternal, that
you are oceanic, that you have always been and you will always be... but
not those small personalities that you have taken again and again. This
time you stop taking personalities and simply become the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole feels more cozy than nothingness, but they are simply two
ways of saying the same thing. The whole appears cozy, it seems you are
becoming more than you were before. And nothing</p><p>seems dangerous – you are becoming even less than you were before.
You were at least something, now you are becoming nothing. But becoming
whole, you have to become nothing. Becoming part of this vast existence,
you have to relax the separateness, the individuality.</p><p><br></p><p>The questioner goes on asking:</p><p><br></p><p>DOES THE DEWDROP STILL FEEL OR EXPERIENCE SOME ALIVENESS INSIDE, WHEN
FIRST IT MELTS INTO THE OCEAN?</p><p><br></p><p>The dewdrop disappearing into the ocean feels for the first time a
vast life. Only the boundaries that were making it a small dewdrop have
disappeared. The dewdrop is still there, but it is no longer a dewdrop,
it has become the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>I have told you about Kabir, one of the most important mystics of the
East.…</p><p><br></p><p>When he became enlightened he wrote down a small statement: “The
dewdrop has disappeared into the ocean – BUND SAMANI SAMUND MEIN.” But
before dying, he called his son Kamal, and told him, “Please correct it.
It was my first experience, now I know better. The dewdrop has not
entered into the ocean; on the contrary, the ocean has entered into the
dewdrop. So write it down that the ocean has entered into the
dewdrop.”</p><p><br></p><p>Both mean the same, but one is the experience of the beginner. The
dewdrop disappearing into the ocean feels like you are going into a vast
nothingness. But once you have reached into that vastness, when you are
no more, suddenly that vastness is you. There will be no self, no sense
of I, but a sense of totality, of wholeness.</p><p><br></p><p>It is difficult to bring it into language. That difficulty is shown
in Kabir’s changing the statement. In fact, no statement is right.
Whether you say the dewdrop has entered into the ocean, or you say the
ocean has entered into the dewdrop, you are still talking of two things:
the dewdrop and the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>If I had been present there, I would have said, “It is better to
cancel both. Whatever has happened has happened, nothing can be said
about it. One thing is certain, there is no more separation. So what has
entered into what does not matter. There have been two, now there are
not two.”</p><p><br></p><p>The sutra:</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>GYOZAN SAID TO SEKISHITSU, “TELL ME WHAT TO BELIEVE IN AND WHAT TO
RELY ON?” SEKISHITSU GESTURED ACROSS THE SKY ABOVE, THREE TIMES WITH HIS
HAND, AND</p><p>SAID, “THERE IS NO SUCH THING in which you can believe, on which you
can rely. THERE IS NO SUCH THING.”</p><p><br></p><p>What does he mean by gesturing three times to the sky?</p><p><br></p><p>Existence is just a vast sky with no end and no beginning, no
boundary. There is nothing to believe and nothing to rely on. One has
just to disappear. All belief is man manufactured, and all reliance,</p><p>relying on a God or relying on a Christ, is out of your own fear. But
there is nothing to rely on, and there is no security.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t cling with anything. Everything that you cling to is your own
imagination. Your gods are your imagination, and your philosophies are
your imagination. Existence has no gods, and existence has no
philosophies – just a pure silence, but a silence which is musical, a
silence which is a dance; a silence which blossoms into many flowers,
and into many fragrances; a silence which manifests into immense
varieties; a silence which is multidimensional. Just relax into it.
Don’t try to believe or trust, because all belief and trust is
clinging.</p><p><br></p><p>SEKISHITSU GESTURED ACROSS THE SKY ABOVE, THREE TIMES WITH HIS HAND,
AND</p><p>SAID, “THERE IS NO SUCH THING... You just please drop the very idea
of relying on anything, or believing in anything. Just relax. This whole
existence is yours. Why do you want to cling to a special part? It is
all the same – the same sky, the same silence, the same purity, same
innocence.”</p><p><br></p><p>GYOZAN ASKED, “WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT READING SUTRAS?”</p><p><br></p><p>Man wants something. His mind is always finding some way to avoid the
nothingness or the wholeness of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Gyozan immediately asked, “If there is nothing to believe and nothing
to rely upon, what do you say about reading sutras?”</p><p><br></p><p>SEKISHITSU REPLIED, “ALL THE SUTRAS ARE OUT OF THE QUESTION. DOING
THINGS THAT ARE GIVEN BY OTHERS IS DUALISM OF MIND AND MATTER. AND IF
YOU ARE IN THE DUALISM OF SUBJECT AND OBJECT, VARIOUS VIEWS ARISE. BUT
THIS IS BLIND WISDOM, SO IT IS NOT YET THE TAO.</p><p><br></p><p>“IF OTHERS DON’T GIVE YOU ANYTHING, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE
THING...”</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever thought about it? – that all that you know has been
given to you by others. If you put that aside to sort out what is yours,
you will find a pure emptiness is yours, everything else has been given
to you by others. Then who are you? – a pure emptiness hidden behind all
those words and beliefs and religions which have been given to you.</p><p><br></p><p>“IF OTHERS DON’T GIVE YOU ANYTHING, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING.
THAT’S WHY BODHIDHARMA SAID, ‘ORIGINALLY, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE
THING.’”</p><p><br></p><p>Bodhidharma’s statement is of tremendous value. There is not a single
thing separate from the whole. All separation, all dualism, is the game
of the mind. As the mind becomes silent, all that game disappears, all
those players are no longer there.</p><p><br></p><p>What happens when you wake up in the morning to your dreams? In the
dreams have you ever doubted that what you are seeing is not true?
Nobody in a dream can doubt. Whatever appears in the dream, appears to
be the right thing at the moment. Only in the morning when you wake up,
suddenly do you realize that all the night you have been dreaming of
things which were not true, which were just mind creations, flowers in
the sky – Bodhidharma’s statement, “ORIGINALLY, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE
THING.”</p><p>“YOU SEE, WHEN A BABY COMES OUT OF THE WOMB, DOES HE READ SUTRAS OR
NOT? AT THAT TIME, THE BABY DOES NOT KNOW WHETHER SUCH A THING AS BUDDHA
NATURE EXISTS OR NOT. AS HE GROWS UP AND LEARNS VARIOUS VIEWS, HE
APPEARS TO THE WORLD AND SAYS, ‘I DO WELL AND I UNDERSTAND.’ BUT HE
DOESN’T KNOW IT IS RUBBISH AND DELUSION.</p><p><br></p><p>“OF THE SIXTEEN WAYS OR PHASES OF DOING, A BABY’S WAY IS THE BEST.
THE TIME OF A BABY’S GURGLE IS COMPARED TO A SEEKER WHEN HE LEAVES THE
MIND OF DIVIDING AND CHOOSING. THAT’S WHY A BABY IS PRAISED. BUT IF YOU
TAKE THIS COMPARISON AND SAY, ‘THE BABY IS THE WAY,’ PEOPLE OF THE
PRESENT DAYS WILL UNDERSTAND IT WRONGLY.”</p><p><br></p><p>And that is true even today.</p><p><br></p><p>When I am saying to you, “Be nothing,” I am saying in other words,
“Be just a newborn baby, a pure consciousness, undivided into knowing
and not knowing. The baby’s consciousness is pure. It knows nothing, it
does not even know that it is.”</p><p><br></p><p>You must have heard small babies talk about themselves as separate
persons. They may say, “The baby is hungry. The baby is thirsty.” The
“I” takes a little time to grow. It takes at least three to four years
for society to create an ego so the baby starts saying “I” – instead of
saying, “The baby” is hungry, “I” am hungry. And the moment the baby
says, “I am hungry,” he is no longer a baby. He has entered into the
world, he has graduated, in a way.</p><p><br></p><p>But according to Zen, once again you have to become just like the
baby. This second childhood is the greatest revolution possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus is right when he says, “Unless you are born again, you will not
understand the truth.” He had been traveling for seventeen years in the
East, and he had gathered much. And that was really the problem why Jews
could not accept him. He was talking a language that was not theirs. He
was making interpretations of the old Jewish tradition in a way that had
never been heard and that he had brought from the East.</p><p><br></p><p>And at that time the whole of the East was full of the vibrations of
Gautam Buddha. Just five hundred years had passed since Gautam Buddha
was alive, yet his vibrations were in the atmosphere. And there are
possibilities that Jesus did not only visit India and Tibet. There is a
place in Japan which also proclaims that he visited there. In the Bible
these seventeen years are completely missing. They don’t listen to any
other argument, because that would be disturbing to whatever they have
managed up to now as their Holy Bible.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was much influenced by Buddha’s teachings. This teaching,
“Unless you are born again,” has the flavor of Gautam Buddha who was
continuously teaching that you have to drop everything that has been
told to you, you have to forget everything that has been programmed in
you. Gautam Buddha brings to the world the first deprogramming
philosophy. And when you are deprogrammed completely, who are you? –
just a pure nothingness, just a silence. All words were borrowed, all
sutras were given to you, all religions were forced on your mind. You
are not a Christian, and you are not a Hindu, and you are not a
Mohammedan. You were born just as pure consciousness.</p><p>You have to attain that pure consciousness again. This is rebirth.
And this rebirth brings the buddha, the pure consciousness, the
consciousness which knows no boundaries; hence, it cannot call itself
“I.” A consciousness which has become one with the whole has nothing to
say.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha, when he became enlightened, for seven days remained silent,
wondering whether to say it or not. “Because in every possible way,” he
thought, “it will be misunderstood. It is better to be silent.” But a
compassionate heart could not be at ease in silence, seeing that
“Everybody needs this exploration, this excursion into himself. I know
the way, if I remain silent it will be criminal. But if I say anything,
then too, I will not be absolutely right in saying it, because that
which is beyond the word cannot be brought into the word.”</p><p><br></p><p>So after seven days, compassion took over, and finally he tried. For
forty-two years he went on saying to people, and always making it clear
– “What I am saying, don’t take it literally. I want you to experience
it. Only then will you understand the meaning of it – not by hearing me,
but by experiencing it. Only by tasting it, will you know the sweetness
of it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Boncho wrote:</p><p><br></p><p>RIVER.</p><p><br></p><p>ONE LONG LINE</p><p><br></p><p>THROUGH SNOWY FIELDS.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is just a river, a long river – a long line through snowy
fields. And then what happens? Each river, small or big, dissolves into
the ocean, finds its way without any guide, without any sutras, without
any masters. It may go astray, zigzag, but finally it reaches to the
ocean. And that reaching to the ocean is becoming the ocean. That is the
rebirth. That’s what we mean by meditation. That’s what we mean by the
Zen Manifesto.</p><p><br></p><p>Every river is destined to disappear one day into the ocean. Go
dancingly, go joyfully. There is no need to be worried, there is no need
to be hurried. The ocean is waiting – you can take your time, but take
your time with joy, not with tensions and anxieties. Rejoice and dance
and sing and love, and finally you are going to disappear into the
ocean. The ocean is always waiting for you.</p><p><br></p><p>Even though you are far away from the ocean you are part of it,
always reaching, always coming closer to the ocean. Everybody is going
to become a buddha today or tomorrow – and there are only seven days in
a week, so you can choose...!</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha’s question:</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>WILHELM REICH SAYS, IN HIS BOOK, ‘LISTEN, LITTLE MAN,’ THAT HE FOUND
THAT MAN REACHES OUT WITH HIS LIFE ENERGY WHEN HE FEELS WELL AND LOVING;
THAT HE</p><p>RETRACTS THAT ENERGY WHEN HE IS AFRAID. REICH SAYS THAT HE FOUND THAT
THIS LIFE ENERGY – WHICH HE TERMED “ORGONE” – IS “FOUND IN THE
ATMOSPHERE,” OUTSIDE THE BODY. HE SAYS HE SUCCEEDED IN SEEING IT AND
DEVISED APPARATUS WHICH MAGNIFIED IT.</p><p><br></p><p>IS WHAT HE OBSERVED SO?</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, Wilhelm Reich was one of the unique intelligences born in
this century. What he has found has been known to the East as aura.</p><p><br></p><p>You must have seen around the statues of Buddha or Mahavira or
Krishna – a round aura around the head. That round aura is a reality.
What Wilhelm Reich said was authentically true, but the people to whom
he said it were not the right people to understand it. They thought he
was mad because he described life as an energy surrounding the body. It
is exactly true.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is an energy that surrounds your body. Not only your body, but
flowers, trees... everything has its own aura. And that aura, that
energy surrounding you shrinks and expands, in different situations.</p><p><br></p><p>Any situation where your energy shrinks, should be thought bad, sick.
And every situation where your energy expands, should be respected and
loved. In love your energy reaches out, you become more alive. And when
you are in fear, your energy shrinks, you become less alive.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, poor Wilhelm Reich was thought by Americans to be mad, because
he was not only magnifying that energy – he had found a few exercises in
which that energy magnifies – he was even catching that energy in boxes,
big boxes in which a man could enter. And if the man was sick he would
come out whole and healthy. Naturally such a man should be thought mad.
He was selling those boxes, empty boxes – but they were not empty. He
had found ways to collect the energy which is available in the
atmosphere. Around a tree you can find that energy showering, but with
your bare eyes you cannot see it.</p><p><br></p><p>After he was declared mad and imprisoned, another man in the Soviet
Union even managed to photograph it. And now it has become a recognized
psychology in the Soviet Union, that life has an aura. And the man,
Kirlian, has developed a certain sensitive plate to photograph it.</p><p><br></p><p>He would photograph the hand, and the hand would come with an aura
around it. In a very strange way his photographs even showed if a man
would be sick within six months: “Right now he does not show any pattern
of sickness, but his aura is shrinking at a certain point...” And if at
a certain point the aura is shrinking, maybe the person will become
deaf, or blind if the aura around the eyes is shrinking. And all his
photographs proved to be right. When he said, “This man is in danger of
losing his eyesight,” there was no visible sign, there was no reason to
believe it, but within six months that man became blind.</p><p><br></p><p>Now in Soviet psychology, Kirlian photography is recognized by the
government. It is spreading into other countries also.</p><p><br></p><p>A man can be cured before he becomes sick. Kirlian photography is
very predictive. It shows, at least six months ahead, what is going to
happen.</p><p>In the East, it has been known for centuries that before your death –
six months before – you stop being able to see the tip of your nose.
Because your eyes start turning upwards, they cannot see the tip of your
own nose. The moment you recognize you cannot see the tip of your nose
means that within six months your energy will shrink, go back to its
source. And the aura, without any photographic technology, has been
recognized by yoga for five thousand years. But now, it can be accepted
on scientific grounds.</p><p><br></p><p>Wilhelm Reich was a unique genius. He could manage to see and feel
what is not ordinarily possible.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you are very meditative, you will start seeing the auras of
people, even your own aura. You will see your own hand with the light
rays around it, radiating. And when you are healthy you will feel your
aura expanding. When you are sick you will feel your aura shrinking –
something is shrinking within you.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are by the side of a sick person, you will have a strange
feeling that he somehow makes you feel sick, because the sick person
exploits the auras of the other without his knowing. He needs more life,
so whoever has life and comes around him – he takes his life.</p><p><br></p><p>And you know by experience, without understanding, that there are
people you want to avoid, because meeting them you feel sick, meeting
them you feel that something has been taken away from you. And there are
people you want to meet, because meeting them you feel an expanding, you
feel more alive.</p><p><br></p><p>Wilhelm Reich was right, but unfortunately the masses never accept
their own geniuses; on the contrary, they condemn them. Because if
Wilhelm Reich is right, then everybody else is almost blind. And in
anger he wrote the book, LISTEN, LITTLE MAN. But that book is beautiful,
and his anger can be forgiven because he was mistreated by “the little
man,” by the masses. He was first thought to be mad, then forced into a
madhouse, and he died in a madhouse.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East, he would have become a Gautam Buddha. He had the
quality, the insight. But a wrong society, a society of very little men,
of very small people... small-minded, who cannot conceive the vast, who
cannot conceive the mysterious.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole atmosphere is full of life. And if you understand your own
sources of life, you will be suddenly aware that birds are alive, trees
are alive, grasses are alive – everywhere there is life! And you can
dance with this life, you can start having a dialogue with the
atmosphere. Of course, people will think you are mad, because people are
still the same. The same people crucified Jesus, the same people forced
Wilhelm Reich into a madhouse, the same people poisoned Socrates... but
those little people are in the majority.</p><p><br></p><p>Wilhelm Reich’s anger is right, but still I would say, rather than
anger, the little man needs compassion. He was angry because they
misbehaved with him, they destroyed his whole life. Rather than
understanding him – he would have opened a new door to experiencing, to
loving, to living – they destroyed the man completely. Obviously, he
became angry.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East, the same little men are there, but the Eastern genius
has never been angry with them. Rather than being angry, it has shown
compassion, it has felt compassion for their blindness, and it has tried
in every way to bring light to them, a little understanding to their
hearts.</p><p>It is time for Sardar Gurudayal Singh.…</p><p><br></p><p>The Reverend Rump is very excited one afternoon when a new organ is
delivered to his church. A large crowd of people gathers outside the
church to watch as the organ is slowly lifted out of the delivery
truck.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, one of the delivery men lets go of a rope and the organ
starts to fall on top of the Reverend Rump, who is standing beneath it.
But at the last moment, Hamish MacTavish pushes the vicar aside and
stops the organ before it smashes on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>“Bless you, my son,” gasps Reverend Rump, picking himself up. “You
saved me! When you come to church next Sunday, you can come and play on
this new church organ!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah!” sighs Hamish. “There is no need for me to go to church, Vicar.”
“Really, my son?” asks Rump. “Why not?”</p><p>“You see, Vicar,” replies Hamish, “I have a church of my own at
home.” “Really?” asks the vicar. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Well,” explains Hamish. “It is like this. My whole family lives in
one room, so we have a three-level bed. The kids are on the top level,
singing all day like little angels. Then, on the middle level, there is
my mother-in-law. She is preaching day and night, dealing out the Ten
Commandments and the wrath of God. Then, on the bottom level, there is
me and my wife – playing on my organ!”</p><p><br></p><p>Swimming casually in the warm sea waters off the coast of Africa, are
four huge sharks – Jaws, Toothy, Munch, and Little Belch. The
conversation naturally turns to their favorite joy – eating.</p><p><br></p><p>“The best food in the world is found just near Australia,” says Jaws,
the biggest shark. “The menu is full of young, sporting people with
tender muscles and skin well toasted by the sun.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, that is okay,” replies Toothy, the big white shark, “but an even
better delicacy can be found off the Canary Islands. The beaches are
packed with fat, oily German tourists. Just like butter melting on your
tongue!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Not bad,” interrupts Munch, the oldest shark. “In my long years of
gobbling, I find the summer waters off Miami Beach to be the ultimate in
dining pleasure. The place is filled with politicians with their giant
livers soaked in rum or wine – and no backbones!”</p><p><br></p><p>Then, old Munch turns to the youngster of the group, Little Belch. He
hears a strange sound coming from Belch’s stomach, and asks, “Hey, kid!
What is that noise coming out of your belly? Where have you been
eating?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah!” groans Belch, “I have got indigestion. I went for lunch
yesterday off the beach at Goa – and the strange people I ate there will
not stop singing and dancing!”</p><p>Mrs. Nora Bone gets a midnight telephone call from her son, Billy,
who just got married that afternoon and is staying at the Swelling
Sausage Honeymoon Hotel.</p><p><br></p><p>“Mom,” sobs Billy, tearfully down the phone, “we are having some
problems in the bedroom!” “What kind of problems, Billy?” asks Nora
Bone, anxiously.</p><p>“Well, Mom,” moans Billy, “Nellie is lying there on the bed, naked
and breathing hard.… And, well... Gee, Mom – I don’t know what to
do!”</p><p><br></p><p>“It is quite simple, Billy,” snaps Nora Bone, in her best motherly
voice, “you just take down your pants and put the hardest part of your
body in the place where Nellie, your wife, you know... where she
wee-wees!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, I get it!” cries Billy. “Gee, thanks, Mom!” – and he puts down
the phone.</p><p><br></p><p>Mrs. Nora Bone sighs deeply, shakes her head and goes back to bed.
But fifteen minutes later, the phone rings again. This time it is Nellie
Bone, her new daughter-in-law.</p><p><br></p><p>“What is the matter now?” snaps Mrs. Nora Bone.</p><p><br></p><p>“It is your son, Billy!” cries Nellie. “He has got his head stuck
down the toilet!” Nivedano...</p><p>(Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat) Be silent...</p><p>Close your eyes... and feel your bodies to be completely frozen. This
is the right moment to enter in.</p><p>Gather all your energies, your total consciousness, and rush towards
the center of your being, just two inches below the navel inside you –
the hara center – with an urgency as if this is the last moment of your
life.</p><p><br></p><p>Faster and faster... Deeper and deeper...</p><p>As you are coming close to the center of your being, a great silence
descends over you, and a peace that you have never known, and a light
fills your whole interior.</p><p>From the very center you can do one thing which is not possible
otherwise – witnessing. Witness that you are not the body.</p><p>Witness that you are not the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Witness that you are only a witnessing consciousness, a pure
consciousness, eternal, immortal. This is your being and everybody’s
being.</p><p>To deepen this witnessing, Nivedano...</p><p>(Drumbeat)</p><p><br></p><p>Relax... but remember the source of hara – the very source of your
life – and flowers will start showering on you.</p><p><br></p><p>You are melting into a consciousness which is vaster than you.
Gautama the Buddha Auditorium has become an ocean of consciousness. Ten
thousand buddhas are no longer ten thousand, but a single, a non-dual,
pure consciousness without any ripples in it.</p><p><br></p><p>This is your buddha nature. Out of this buddha nature arises all
ecstasy, all blessings, all blissfulness.</p><p><br></p><p>This is only an experiment – it has to become your very life. You
have to be a buddha around the clock, alert, aware, compassionate,
loving, rejoicing in life, expanding life, making it a dance.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen is not a renunciation, it is a rejoicing.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the manifesto of dance and celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>Collect all these experiences which are happening inside you, you
have to bring them to your everyday life. And ask the flame, which is
symbolized by the face of Gautam Buddha, to come behind you. The face of
Gautam Buddha is everybody’s original face. It will come behind you. It
has been waiting for you to request it.</p><p><br></p><p>First, it will come following you. Soon you will find you are
following it. And at the third stage, the final stage, you will
disappear, only the buddha remains.</p><p><br></p><p>The buddha is your nothingness, and it is your fullness. It is your
wholeness. You can call it any name, but remember it is universal. It
has nothing to do with you and me.</p><p><br></p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Come back... but come back as buddhas – silent, peacefully, with a
grace, and a beauty.</p><p>Just for a few moments, remember where you have been, the space that
you entered, the center than you touched, the flame that you have
seen.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly slowly, meditation becomes your very life, your very
heartbeat. That day is the most blessed day when you don’t have to
meditate – you are meditation. Your very being, whatever you are doing
or not doing, is silent, peaceful, loving, alert and aware of its
eternity.</p><p><br></p><p>This experience is the only sacred experience. This experience brings
back again your childhood, a pure silent consciousness, rejoicing in
everything that it does. The whole universe becomes a celebration and
life is no longer a misery. Every moment existence is available for you
to rejoice, sing, dance, love, and expand your life energies.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind only thinks, meditation lives. Mind is a very small thing.</p><p>Meditation is as vast as the whole universe.</p><p><br></p><p>I teach you the vastness, I teach you universality, I teach you
eternity.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not what you appear in the mirror, you are much more. You are
vast, as vast as the whole universe.</p><p><br></p><p>This declaration is the Zen Manifesto. Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

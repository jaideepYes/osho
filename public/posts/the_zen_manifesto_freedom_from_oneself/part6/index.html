ON A VISIT TO SEKITO, THE MONK, SEKISHITSU, BECAME ENLIGHTENED. AFTER HIS ENLIGHTENMENT, SEKISHITSU WENT BACK TO HIS MASTER, CHOSHI. CHOSHI HAD ALSO BEEN A DISCIPLE OF SEKITO.\nCHOSHI SAID, “DID YOU REACH SEKITO?”\nSEKISHITSU REPLIED, “YES, I DID, BUT WAS NOT INTRODUCED.” CHOSHI SAID, “WHO DID YOU RECEIVE PRECEPTS FROM?” SEKISHITSU REPLIED, “NOT FROM HIM.”\nCHOSHI THEN SAID, “IF YOU WERE LIKE THAT THERE, WHAT WILL YOU BE HERE?” SEKISHITSU SAID, “NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE.”\nCHOSHI SAID, “THAT IS TOO MUCH.”\nSEKISHITSU SAID, “MY TONGUE HAS NO COLOR YET.”\nCHOSHI REPLIED, “YOU NOISY NOVICE – GO AWAY!” AND SEKISHITSU IMMEDIATELY WENT AWAY.\nFriends,\nFirst the questions from sannyasins. Question 1\nThe first question:\nFROM WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY LAST NIGHT ABOUT REINCARNATION, I UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN INDIVIDUALITY IS SUPERFICIAL.\nREINCARNATION WAS A CONSOLATION FOR ME, THAT “MY ESSENCE” OR “SOUL” WOULD CONTINUE. BUT NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT NOTHING OF ME WILL CONTINUE.\nIN WITNESSING, DO WE ALL “PLUG IN” TO THE SAME WITNESSING ENERGY? DON’T I EVEN HAVE MY OWN WITNESS?\nThe ultimate truth hurts very much.\nFinally, everything is gone, including me and you. What remains is a pure consciousness. It is not that you are plugged into it, you are no more.\nThe dispersion is so intimate and so ultimate that first your personality has to disappear, then your individuality has to disappear, then what remains is pure existence. It makes one feel a little worried and concerned, because you don’t know the experience of not being.\nJust think for a moment.Before this life you were not. Was there any trouble? Any anxiety?\nAfter this life you will not be again. What is the fear? There will be silence and peace, in the same space where anxiety, tensions and anguishes flourished. They all will have melted just the way a dewdrop disappears into the ocean.\nHence, Zen does not teach you self-realization. Self-realization is a much lower goal. Zen teaches you the ultimate: no-self realization, or realizing that disappearing into the whole is the final peace.\nYour very being is an anxiety. At whatever level you are, some anxiety will remain. You are anxiety, and if you want anxiety to disappear, you have to be ready to disappear yourself.\nQuestion 2\nThe second question:\nIN MY WITNESSING I HAVE EXPERIENCED NOTHING – BY THAT, I MEAN THAT THERE WAS NOTHING DISCERNABLE OTHER THAN THE SIMPLE STATE OF CONSCIOUS WAITING. I HAVE WITNESSED EVENTS OF THE MIND, BODY AND EMOTIONS, AND I HAVE OBSERVED OUT-OF- THE-BODY EXPERIENCES, BUT I DON’T HAVE THE CLARITY TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THESE THINGS.\nWHAT IS THE NATURE OF NO-MIND APART FROM MIND? IS IT A RECEPTIVE, PASSIVE MIND AS OPPOSED TO AN ACTIVE MIND? OR IS IT TRULY NON-MIND? AND HOW DOES CONSCIOUSNESS RECEIVE AND RECOGNIZE INFORMATION IF IT HAS NO MIND-BRAIN TO PERCEIVE IT?\nYou have asked too many questions in one question.\nThe first thing to remember is that when I say witness, in the beginning you witness things of the body, of the mind, of the heart, emotions, thoughts... layer upon layer you go on witnessing. And finally, you find just a pure mirror, the witness itself. I call it a pure mirror because it is witnessing nothing. This nothingness is your very nature.\nOut of this nothingness arises everything, and into this nothingness dissolves everything. And if you are ready to be nothing – even while you are alive – your life will have a flavor of peace, silence, and grace.\nAll your educational systems and all your cultural beliefs, force you to be ambitious, to be somebody. But to be somebody means creating anxieties in a silent pool, ripples and waves. The greater the ambition, the more tidal is the wave of anxiety. You can become almost insane desiring. Trying to be somebody, you are trying the impossible, because basically you are nobody.\nZen has an absolutely unique perception into the nothingness of everyone. It does not teach you any ambition, it does not teach you to be someone else. It simply wants you to know that in the deepest part of your being you are still nothing, you are still carrying the original purity which is not even contaminated by an idea of “I.”\nSo while you are witnessing, you say, “I have experienced nothing.” If you have experienced nothing, you should not be there. Experiencing nothing means you are not, nothing is – simply waves in the water, coming and going.\nIt is not that you witness nothing. You are creating another small “I,” but it contains the whole world of ambitions. Experiencing nothing simply means you are not. And there comes a tremendous joy, because the whole energy that was involved in anxieties and desires and tensions, is released in a dance, in a blissfulness, in a silence, in a tremendous insight, but it does not belong to any “I” – a pure white cloud without any roots, floating in freedom, without any reason and without any direction. The whole existence has become its home. It no longer separates itself. This inseparation is the ultimate blossoming of buddhahood. To know that you are not is the greatest knowing.\nYou ask in your question if there is no one who perceives all this. That no one is not yet no one if it perceives anything. When there is nothing left, there is no perceiver, everything is dissolved into existence.\nZen is the only existential religion in the world. Every religion thrives on your desire to be separate, to be individual, to be special, to be self-realized, to be a saint. Those are all cowardly desires.\nZen is a brave step.\nIt cannot be transcended by anything more courageous.\nA quantum leap into nothing and silence.…\nIf you start asking who is silent, you are not silent. If you start asking who is perceiving all this, who is witnessing, you have not yet come to the nothingness I am indicating to you.\nAnd it is such a small thing to understand what you have gained by being – troubles. Zen shows you the way of non-being, the way out of all troubles, the way of silence.\nMeditation comes to its flowering when there is nobody. This flower of nobodiness, of nothingness, is the ultimate expression of existential heights. Otherwise, you remain a small someone, somebody, confined. Why not be the whole? When it is possible to drop into the ocean, why remain a dewdrop and be afraid of many kinds of death, of the sun which will evaporate you...?\nWhy not take a small jump into the ocean and disappear? Why not be the ocean itself? It is another way of saying it. When I say, “Be nothing,” I am simply saying, “Why not be everything?”\nDisappear into the existence. You will blossom into flowers, you will fly with the birds; you will become clouds, you will be oceans, you will be rivers, but you will not be somebody special with an “I.” The “I” is the trouble, the only trouble, and then it creates many troubles around it.\nThe whole experience of Zen is the experience of getting into a state of no-I, no-self, and then there is no question – nobody is to ask, and nobody is to answer.\nQuestion 3\nThe third question:\nIT HAS BEEN SAID THAT DUALITY IS THE NATURE OF MIND. BUT BY SAYING “MIND” DOES THAT MEAN ONLY THE ANALYTICAL PROCESSES WHICH OCCUR MAINLY IN THE LEFT BRAIN? DOES THAT MEAN THAT ACTIVITY SUCH AS MUSIC, BEAUTY, WHOLENESS AND SYNTHESIS ALSO ARISE FROM AN INEVITABLE INTRINSIC DUALISM OF THE MIND ITSELF?\nEverything that arises out of the mind is bound to be dual. It may be arising from the right side of the mind or the left side of the mind, it does not matter.\nThere is a music which does not rise from the mind. That music is absolutely soundless, and is heard only by those who have come to be nothing. There is a beauty known, there is a dance experienced only by those who have gone beyond the duality of the mind. Meditation can be defined as going beyond the duality of the mind.\nWhatever comes out of the mind is going to be ordinary; it may be music, it may be mathematics. One arises from the right side, one arises from the left side – that does not matter. Your music and your mathematics, your philosophy and your poetry, all are very superficial.\nBut there is something in you which is never heard, never can be said, never can be conveyed, but can only be lived. This nothingness I am talking about is a living experience of being no one. Out of that nothingness, a life arises full of music, but the music is soundless; full of beauty, but the beauty is formless; full of joy, but the joy is indefinable; full of dance, but there is no movement.\nA meditator knows something that mind is not capable of knowing about. The mind only knows the superficial, and the superficial is always dual; it is divided for and against.\nNothingness is non-dual, it is not divided. It is just pure silence, but a very alive silence. And if out of that silence anything happens, that has a beauty and a truth which anything created by the mind cannot be compared with.\nA man of silence – he may not even do anything, but just his silence is a blessing to the whole existence. His silence is a music only heard by those who have gone deeper and beyond the mind.\nThe sutra:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nSEKISHITSU WAS A DISCIPLE OF CHOSHI. ON A VISIT TO SEKITO, THE MONK, SEKISHITSU, BECAME ENLIGHTENED. AFTER HIS ENLIGHTENMENT, SEKISHITSU WENT BACK TO HIS MASTER, CHOSHI. CHOSHI HAD ALSO BEEN A DISCIPLE OF SEKITO.\nCHOSHI SAID, “DID YOU REACH SEKITO?”\nSEKISHITSU REPLIED, “YES, I DID, BUT WAS NOT INTRODUCED.” CHOSHI SAID, “WHO DID YOU RECEIVE PRECEPTS FROM?” SEKISHITSU REPLIED, “NOT FROM HIM.”\nDo you see the mysterious way Sekishitsu is replying? When asked, “DID YOU REACH SEKITO?” he said, “YES, I DID, BUT WAS NOT INTRODUCED, because neither has he a form nor have I a form. Neither has he a name nor have I a name. There is no possibility of introduction.”\nChoshi said, “WHO DID YOU RECEIVE PRECEPTS FROM?” – then from whom have you received the teachings?\nSekishitsu replied, “NOT FROM HIM – I have received, but I have received from a nothingness. To me, my master was not a man of words. We met beyond the words. We looked into each other’s eyes and something transpired. But he has not said a single word; that is why I cannot say that I have received any teachings from him. Of course, being with him I have become enlightened.”\nSekishitsu became enlightened just by seeing Sekito. Nothing was verbally said to him; neither did he become a disciple, nor did he become initiated. Just watching Sekito... just seeing that pillar of silence, that nothingness – and he simply disappeared as a being, himself; he became a nothing. And without saying a word, he left Sekito and went back to his master, Choshi.\nChoshi became enlightened also in the company of Sekito. That is why he is interested in asking what has happened: “DID YOU REACH SEKITO? – because you look as if you have not only reached him, but you have found him. You have penetrated his being; you are carrying his fragrance. What is the matter? DID YOU REACH SEKITO?”\nSEKISHITSU REPLIED, “YES, I DID, BUT WAS NOT INTRODUCED. Nothing was said by him, and\nnothing was said by me.”\nChoshi said, “Then from whom did you receive the precepts? You seem to have realized the purity of consciousness. You cannot deceive me; I can see you are no more. How did it happen? Who told you the precepts – the techniques, the methods, the disciplines?”\nSekishitsu replied, again in a roundabout way, “NOT FROM HIM.”\nCHOSHI THEN SAID, “IF YOU WERE LIKE THAT THERE, WHAT WILL YOU BE HERE? If you have\nnot received the teachings, the disciplines, the precepts from a great master, Sekito, what kind of person are you going to be here? IF YOU WERE LIKE THAT THERE, WHAT WILL YOU BE HERE?”\nSEKISHITSU SAID, “NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE. I will be the same. Neither time makes any difference, nor space makes any difference. I was no one there, I will be no one here.”\nSEKISHITSU SAID, “NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE.”\nChoshi could not understand this roundabout way of talking; he was a simple man of Zen. He said, “THAT IS TOO MUCH if you are going to be the same here too. Here you have to follow the precepts; here you have to meditate. Here you have to enter into the world of Zen.”\nBut Choshi was not a great master of Zen, he was a man of Zen. He has understood nothingness, but he was not capable of conveying it. He said, “THAT IS TOO MUCH if you are not going to be any different here.”\nSEKISHITSU SAID, “MY TONGUE HAS NO COLOR YET.” He is saying, “Don’t be worried. I am as pure as a child. I have not been programmed by anyone. I am a tabula rasa, a clean slate. My tongue has no color yet.”\nCHOSHI REPLIED, “YOU NOISY NOVICE” – because according to Choshi, this young man was just a novice. He could not penetrate and see in this novice the transformation that had happened in the companionship of Sekito.\nHe was an ordinary man of Zen who had followed precepts, principles, step by step. He could not understand this quantum leap – a pure jump. That was too much. He thought, “This man is too noisy. I am asking simple questions; he goes on in a roundabout way. GO AWAY!” AND SEKISHITSU IMMEDIATELY WENT AWAY.\nThis anecdote is very strange. Its strangeness is that it is not necessary that a man of Zen will be able to understand another man of Zen. Of course, a master will be able to understand all kinds of Zen people, but a master is multidimensional, and a man of Zen is only one-dimensional. He has followed a certain path, and he thinks only by following that path does one reach to the nothingness he has reached.\nIf one has to reach nothingness, any path will do. There are as many paths as there are people to travel. But to understand that, a great master is needed.\nThere have been enlightened people, but still they could not understand other enlightened people for the simple reason that they have followed a certain path and the other fellow has not followed that particular path. They have become too conditioned by the path. They cannot see that when you are going into nothingness, every path is the right path.\nWhen you are going somewhere, every path is not the right path, but when you are going nowhere, every path is the right path. But to understand that every path finally leads into nothingness, needs a multidimensional consciousness.\nThere are masters, and there are mystics, and this is the difference: the mystic can understand only one-dimensionally; the master has a wider view, a bird’s-eye view. He can look from above and see that all paths are leading to nowhere.\nChoshi could not understand Sekishitsu. Sekishitsu left him immediately; this was not the right place for him. He had already gone beyond the paths and the precepts and the scriptures.\nKyorai wrote:\nIMMOBILE HAZE. MOON, SPRING, SLEEP.\nHe is saying this is what life is: “Immobile haze. Moon, spring, sleep” – simple, no complication.\nA sannyasin lives a life of such simplicity: the moon, the spring, the sleep – and he is fulfilled. A little immobile haze, and then arises the moon, then comes the spring – there are flowers – and then the sleep.\nIf you can conceive life in such simple terms – a little dance, a little love, a little playfulness, a little laughter, a little music, and then comes the eternal sleep, life becomes just a small drama. Soon the drama will be over. The acceptance that the drama will be over, that we are just players in a game which is not going to last forever – we will have to vacate the place for other players – then life becomes very simple, without any complexity and without any competition. One lives silently, peacefully, and prepares himself for the eternal peace, the eternal silence, the eternal sleep.\nQuestion 4\nManeesha’s question:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nFRITJOF CAPRA CONTENDS THAT, “MODERN PHYSICS GOES FAR BEYOND TECHNOLOGY. THE WAY – OR TAO – OF PHYSICS CAN BE A PATH WITH A HEART, A WAY TO SPIRITUAL REALIZATION.”\nDO YOU AGREE?\nManeesha, the question is not of agreeing or not agreeing, because all agreements and disagreements are of the mind. I know that Capra is simply guessing. He is a man who knows modern physics and a little bit of the philosophy of Tao. And it is a very small thing to create a physics of Tao, or a Tao of physics, because the word tao simply means the way, and modern physics certainly has gone beyond technology. It has moved beyond the boundaries of mind, and is in a tremendous chaos. As far as mind was concerned, things were clear. But now, modern physics has come to a point where mind cannot make any sense. Capra himself, being a physicist, started learning about Tao in the effort to understand the chaos that modern physics has entered into, and that perhaps Tao may help.\nBut he is not a man of Tao, he is still an intellectual trying to make some definitions, trying to make something out of the chaos. He is still thinking of spiritual realization, and there is no spiritual realization because there is no spirit as such.\nThere is a dispersion into nothingness. You cannot call it realization. It can be called DErealization, but it cannot be called realization. Nothing is realized. Even that which was there is no more – only silence prevails.\nI know the chaos of existence is ultimate. Every effort to bring it into a system is bound to fail. Philosophies have failed, science has failed. More efforts will be made, but I can predict with absolute authority that no system is going to explain this vast existence. It is bound to remain a mystery.\nReligions have tried in their own way, but failed. Philosophies have failed. Science came with great systematic logic, and in the beginning of this century science was absolutely certain that it was going to succeed and explain away the whole mystery of existence, bring it down to rationalization. But on the contrary, the opposite has happened.\nAs science has approached deeper into reality, all its old concepts have become invalid. Now Aristotelian logic is no longer logic, and Euclidean geometry is no longer geometry. Now, science is at a point where everything again has become mysterious – no explanation, and no reason. But the effort continues.\nMy approach is totally different. I want you to know that chaos is the very nature of existence, you cannot make it a cosmos. You cannot make it a system, either by Tao or by Zen. You cannot make it an explained system where everything is knowable.\nI have always divided existence into three segments: the known, the unknown, and the unknowable. That which is unknown will become known tomorrow.\nThat which is known today was unknown yesterday. But the known and the unknown are a very superficial part. Beyond both is the unknowable. That unknowable is a chaos; it is irrational, illogical. There is no way to bring it into explanations, no way to make a science of it, or a philosophy of it. This chaos I have called nothingness. You can enter into it, you can be one with it, you can rejoice in it, but don’t try to conceptualize it.\nSo it is not a question, Maneesha, of my agreement or disagreement with Fritjof Capra. I know existence is a chaos, and will remain always a chaos. All efforts of man are bound to fail in systematizing it. It is not a system; it is not mechanics. Hence, I always have loved Gautam Buddha’s statement. Asked, “What is truth?” he replied in a very strange way. He said, “Whatever works.” He did not define truth, he simply said, “Whatever works is true.”\nAnd more than that, even today we don’t know. We don’t know what electricity is, we only know how it works; we don’t know what it is. There is no way to know it, and there is no need.\nLet existence function.\nUse it, love it, rejoice in it. There is no need to systematize it; all systems are bound to fail. Zen is not a system, it is a path towards the chaos.\nGo dancingly in without bothering and worrying what it is. Rejoice in it!\nWhat is the point in thinking what is music? Love it, listen to it, create it.\nWhat is the point of finding the definition of dance? Dance!\nBut still very few people are of the age, mature enough to recognize this immense chaos without fear, and to use it as much as you can. Love it, live it, and drop the childish idea that you have to understand it. What are you going to do by understanding it? And in the first place, understanding is not possible.\nMind is too small, and existence is too vast – without any boundaries. There is no possibility that there will ever be a system which explains everything. And that will be a very fatal day if some system explains everything – life will lose all joy.\nPeople are trying to explain everything. Then love becomes just chemistry, biology, hormones. Do you ever think about love as hormones, as biology, as chemistry? And the moment you think about chemistry, biology, hormones, love loses all mystery. And certainly love is more than chemistry, biology, or hormones can explain. They may explain sex, but they cannot explain love.\nLove need not be sexual. In fact, at the highest point even sexuality transforms into love... love unexplained, irrational, a chaos. You can experience it, but you cannot explain it.\nIt is time for Sardar Gurudayal Singh.…\nIt is a sunny afternoon in the rose garden of the Vatican in Rome. Pope the Polack is deep in discussion with a smart-looking gentleman in a three-piece suit, carrying a black briefcase.\n“I am prepared to offer you one million dollars!” exclaims Herman Hoover, the businessman. “No way,” says the papal fruitcake. “One billion dollars, and no less!”\n“Okay,” says Herman, “our last offer – five hundred million dollars!”\n“No way!” cries the Polack, stomping his foot. “Six hundred million! One dollar for every Catholic or the deal is off!”\n“Holy shit! Let us forget the whole thing,” shouts Herman. And the businessman walks off in frustration.\nMeanwhile, old Mario the gardener, pops his head over the rosebushes and calls out to the pope. “Hey-a, Your Holiness!” says Mario. “That-a guy wanted to give you so much-a money. Why did-a you refuse?”\n“You don’t understand,” says the Polack. “You don’t know what that guy wanted me to do.” “So?” asks Mario. “What-a did he want?”\n“Well,” says the pope, “he wants us to change the end of the Lord’s Prayer.” “Really?” asks Mario. “But-a, at the end-a we always say-a, amen.”\n“I know,” snaps the Polack pope. “But this guy wants us all to say, Coca-Cola!”\nIt is that fateful night in old Jerusalem town. Upstairs at the downtown MacDonald’s burger house, Jesus is host at his famous farewell dinner party.\nRonald MacDonald, the clown, is running around giving everyone party hats and whistles, trying to get the serious saints to laugh.\nBut Jesus has been looking moody all night when suddenly, he puts down his wineglass and shouts across the smoke-filled room, “Peter!” he cries, pointing his finger. “Peter! Tonight, you are going to betray me!”\n“Ah no, Lord!” calls back Peter, turning pale, “I would never betray you!”\n“Okay, Peter,” says Jesus, “I was just checking up on you. Come over here and eat some bread and drink some wine with me.”\nSo they eat bread and drink some wine. And then Jesus says, “Okay, Peter, you can go.” Then Jesus looks around the room again, and calls John, his beloved disciple.\n“John!” shouts Jesus. “John! Tonight you are going to betray me!”\n“Ah no, Lord!” replies John, falling off his seat in shock. “I would never betray you. It is just not possible!”\n“Okay, John,” replies Jesus. “Don’t get excited! I was just checking. Come over here and drink wine and eat some bread with me!”\nAs the evening progresses, one by one, Jesus calls his apostles to him, eating some bread and drinking wine with each of them.\nFinally, his wandering eye rests on Judas, who has been sitting in the corner for the past hour, making out with Mary Magdelena.\n“Judas!” shouts Jesus.\n“Yes, Lord!” replies Judas, straightening his shirt. “Judas!” cries Jesus. “Come here! I want you!”\n“Yes, Lord,” says Judas, jumping up and standing nervously in front of Jesus. “Judas!” says Jesus. “Tonight, you are going to betray me!”\n“Ah, Jesus Christ!” cries Judas. “Why do you always pick on me when you get drunk?” Sexy Miss Thornbum, the primary school teacher, wiggles into the classroom one morning.\n“Now, children,” she announces, “today, we are going to start a whole new and exciting subject called Sex Education!”\nThere is a loud cheering from the boys, and excited squealing from the girls as Miss Thornbum claps her hands to restore order.\n“Settle down, children!” shouts Miss Thornbum. “Soon, you little boys will be getting interested in some little girls, and some of you little girls will have your little eyes on some little boys.”\nSuddenly, Little Albert interrupts. “Hey, Miss Thornbum!” he shouts. “And for us Little guys who are already screwing – can we go out and play football?”\nNivedano... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat) Be silent.…\nClose your eyes... and feel your bodies to be completely frozen.\nThis is the right moment to enter in.\nGather all your energies, all your consciousness, and rush towards the inner center of your being. It is exactly two inches below the navel, inside you. In Japan they call it hara.\nRush towards this hara with absolute urgency as if this is going to be your last moment. Faster and faster...\nDeeper and deeper...\nAs you start coming close to the hara, a great silence descends over you. And inside, the whole interior becomes luminous.\nAt the very center there is a flame, the eternal flame of life. This eternal flame of light is your very source, and is also going to be your goal.\nAs you come closer and closer to the flame, everything becomes peaceful inside, but a peace that is alive, a silence that is a music, and an experience which allows you to become a witness.\nWitness that you are not the body. Witness that you are not the mind.\nWitness that you are only a witness, a pure witness and nothing else.\nDeepening into this witnessing, one disappears into the ultimate chaos of existence. That is the greatest bliss.\nMake the witnessing deeper and deeper. Nivedano...\n(Drumbeat) Relax...\nJust remain a witness and melt like ice melting into the ocean.\nLet this Gautama the Buddha Auditorium become an ocean of consciousness. You are no more, only a consciousness pervading, prevailing.\nYou are drowned into the ocean.\nThis is the most refreshing experience, and the most transforming experience. This experience makes buddhas out of you.\nA buddha is one who has come to be at ease with existence. These three steps may be significant for you.…\nFirst, the flame follows you. The flame is represented symbolically by the buddha. In the East the face of the buddha has become a symbol of our ultimate nature.\nIn the first step you will find the buddha following you.\nIn the second step, you will find yourself following the buddha as a shadow.\nIn the third step, even the shadow disappears, only the luminous buddha remains. And this luminosity is eternal and immortal, can be experienced but cannot be explained.\nThose who have experienced it, their life has become a light, a joy, a bliss, and a blessing for all those who have come into their contact. In other words, their life becomes a love, a song, a dance, for no reason at all.\nThis great experiment is being done here.\nYou are the most fortunate people in the world this moment, because everybody is busy in the mundane – you are looking for the sacred and the ultimate.\nBefore Nivedano calls you back, collect all this experience, this silence, this peace, these flowers that are showering on you – this music, and this luminosity. And persuade the buddha to come with you, to become part of your everyday existence.\nNivedano... (Drumbeat)\nCome back, but with the same grace, the same silence, the same beauty.\nSit for a few moments just to remember what space you entered into, what golden path you have followed.\nAnd it is not a question just to do meditation at some time of the day. Meditation has to become your very breathing.\nWhatever you have been in these silent moments, you can be twenty-four hours... an undercurrent of joy, peace, love, compassion.\nIn whatever you are doing, you can do it as if you are a buddha. The “as if” will disappear soon, because fundamentally you are buddhas. It is not something that you have to achieve, it is something that you have forgotten and you have to remember it – sammasati.\nOkay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5047","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_zen_manifesto_freedom_from_oneself/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_zen_manifesto_freedom_from_oneself/>The Zen Manifesto.

ON A VISIT TO SEKITO, THE MONK,
SEKISHITSU, BECAME ENLIGHTENED. AFTER HIS ENLIGHTENMENT, SEKISHITSU WENT
BACK TO HIS MASTER, CHOSHI. CHOSHI HAD ALSO BEEN A DISCIPLE OF
SEKITO.</p><p><br></p><p>CHOSHI SAID, “DID YOU REACH SEKITO?”</p><p><br></p><p>SEKISHITSU REPLIED, “YES, I DID, BUT WAS NOT INTRODUCED.” CHOSHI
SAID, “WHO DID YOU RECEIVE PRECEPTS FROM?” SEKISHITSU REPLIED, “NOT FROM
HIM.”</p><p>CHOSHI THEN SAID, “IF YOU WERE LIKE THAT THERE, WHAT WILL YOU BE
HERE?” SEKISHITSU SAID, “NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE.”</p><p>CHOSHI SAID, “THAT IS TOO MUCH.”</p><p><br></p><p>SEKISHITSU SAID, “MY TONGUE HAS NO COLOR YET.”</p><p><br></p><p>CHOSHI REPLIED, “YOU NOISY NOVICE – GO AWAY!” AND SEKISHITSU
IMMEDIATELY WENT AWAY.</p><p>Friends,</p><p><br></p><p>First the questions from sannyasins. Question 1</p><p>The first question:</p><p><br></p><p>FROM WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY LAST NIGHT ABOUT REINCARNATION, I
UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN INDIVIDUALITY IS SUPERFICIAL.</p><p><br></p><p>REINCARNATION WAS A CONSOLATION FOR ME, THAT “MY ESSENCE” OR “SOUL”
WOULD CONTINUE. BUT NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT NOTHING OF ME WILL
CONTINUE.</p><p><br></p><p>IN WITNESSING, DO WE ALL “PLUG IN” TO THE SAME WITNESSING ENERGY?
DON’T I EVEN HAVE MY OWN WITNESS?</p><p><br></p><p>The ultimate truth hurts very much.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, everything is gone, including me and you. What remains is a
pure consciousness. It is not that you are plugged into it, you are no
more.</p><p>The dispersion is so intimate and so ultimate that first your
personality has to disappear, then your individuality has to disappear,
then what remains is pure existence. It makes one feel a little worried
and concerned, because you don’t know the experience of not being.</p><p><br></p><p>Just think for a moment.<span class=s4></span>Before this life you
were not. Was there any trouble? Any anxiety?</p><p><br></p><p>After this life you will not be again. What is the fear? There will
be silence and peace, in the same space where anxiety, tensions and
anguishes flourished. They all will have melted just the way a dewdrop
disappears into the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, Zen does not teach you self-realization. Self-realization is a
much lower goal. Zen teaches you the ultimate: no-self realization, or
realizing that disappearing into the whole is the final peace.</p><p><br></p><p>Your very being is an anxiety. At whatever level you are, some
anxiety will remain. You are anxiety, and if you want anxiety to
disappear, you have to be ready to disappear yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>IN MY WITNESSING I HAVE EXPERIENCED NOTHING – BY THAT, I MEAN THAT
THERE WAS NOTHING DISCERNABLE OTHER THAN THE SIMPLE STATE OF CONSCIOUS
WAITING. I HAVE WITNESSED EVENTS OF THE MIND, BODY AND EMOTIONS, AND I
HAVE OBSERVED OUT-OF- THE-BODY EXPERIENCES, BUT I DON’T HAVE THE CLARITY
TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THESE THINGS.</p><p>WHAT IS THE NATURE OF NO-MIND APART FROM MIND? IS IT A RECEPTIVE,
PASSIVE MIND AS OPPOSED TO AN ACTIVE MIND? OR IS IT TRULY NON-MIND? AND
HOW DOES CONSCIOUSNESS RECEIVE AND RECOGNIZE INFORMATION IF IT HAS NO
MIND-BRAIN TO PERCEIVE IT?</p><p><br></p><p>You have asked too many questions in one question.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing to remember is that when I say witness, in the
beginning you witness things of the body, of the mind, of the heart,
emotions, thoughts... layer upon layer you go on witnessing. And
finally, you find just a pure mirror, the witness itself. I call it a
pure mirror because it is witnessing nothing. This nothingness is your
very nature.</p><p><br></p><p>Out of this nothingness arises everything, and into this nothingness
dissolves everything. And if you are ready to be nothing – even while
you are alive – your life will have a flavor of peace, silence, and
grace.</p><p><br></p><p>All your educational systems and all your cultural beliefs, force you
to be ambitious, to be somebody. But to be somebody means creating
anxieties in a silent pool, ripples and waves. The greater the ambition,
the more tidal is the wave of anxiety. You can become almost insane
desiring. Trying to be somebody, you are trying the impossible, because
basically you are nobody.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen has an absolutely unique perception into the nothingness of
everyone. It does not teach you any ambition, it does not teach you to
be someone else. It simply wants you to know that in the deepest part of
your being you are still nothing, you are still carrying the original
purity which is not even contaminated by an idea of “I.”</p><p><br></p><p>So while you are witnessing, you say, “I have experienced nothing.”
If you have experienced nothing, you should not be there. Experiencing
nothing means you are not, nothing is – simply waves in the water,
coming and going.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not that you witness nothing. You are creating another small
“I,” but it contains the whole world of ambitions. Experiencing nothing
simply means you are not. And there comes a tremendous joy, because the
whole energy that was involved in anxieties and desires and tensions, is
released in a dance, in a blissfulness, in a silence, in a tremendous
insight, but it does not belong to any “I” – a pure white cloud without
any roots, floating in freedom, without any reason and without any
direction. The whole existence has become its home. It no longer
separates itself. This inseparation is the ultimate blossoming of
buddhahood. To know that you are not is the greatest knowing.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask in your question if there is no one who perceives all this.
That no one is not yet no one if it perceives anything. When there is
nothing left, there is no perceiver, everything is dissolved into
existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen is the only existential religion in the world. Every religion
thrives on your desire to be separate, to be individual, to be special,
to be self-realized, to be a saint. Those are all cowardly desires.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen is a brave step.</p><p><br></p><p>It cannot be transcended by anything more courageous.</p><p>A quantum leap into nothing and silence.…</p><p><br></p><p>If you start asking who is silent, you are not silent. If you start
asking who is perceiving all this, who is witnessing, you have not yet
come to the nothingness I am indicating to you.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is such a small thing to understand what you have gained by
being – troubles. Zen shows you the way of non-being, the way out of all
troubles, the way of silence.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation comes to its flowering when there is nobody. This flower
of nobodiness, of nothingness, is the ultimate expression of existential
heights. Otherwise, you remain a small someone, somebody, confined. Why
not be the whole? When it is possible to drop into the ocean, why remain
a dewdrop and be afraid of many kinds of death, of the sun which will
evaporate you...?</p><p><br></p><p>Why not take a small jump into the ocean and disappear? Why not be
the ocean itself? It is another way of saying it. When I say, “Be
nothing,” I am simply saying, “Why not be everything?”</p><p><br></p><p>Disappear into the existence. You will blossom into flowers, you will
fly with the birds; you will become clouds, you will be oceans, you will
be rivers, but you will not be somebody special with an “I.” The “I” is
the trouble, the only trouble, and then it creates many troubles around
it.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole experience of Zen is the experience of getting into a state
of no-I, no-self, and then there is no question – nobody is to ask, and
nobody is to answer.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT DUALITY IS THE NATURE OF MIND. BUT BY SAYING
“MIND” DOES THAT MEAN ONLY THE ANALYTICAL PROCESSES WHICH OCCUR MAINLY
IN THE LEFT BRAIN? DOES THAT MEAN THAT ACTIVITY SUCH AS MUSIC, BEAUTY,
WHOLENESS AND SYNTHESIS ALSO ARISE FROM AN INEVITABLE INTRINSIC DUALISM
OF THE MIND ITSELF?</p><p><br></p><p>Everything that arises out of the mind is bound to be dual. It may be
arising from the right side of the mind or the left side of the mind, it
does not matter.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a music which does not rise from the mind. That music is
absolutely soundless, and is heard only by those who have come to be
nothing. There is a beauty known, there is a dance experienced only by
those who have gone beyond the duality of the mind. Meditation can be
defined as going beyond the duality of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever comes out of the mind is going to be ordinary; it may be
music, it may be mathematics. One arises from the right side, one arises
from the left side – that does not matter. Your music and your
mathematics, your philosophy and your poetry, all are very
superficial.</p><p><br></p><p>But there is something in you which is never heard, never can be
said, never can be conveyed, but can only be lived. This nothingness I
am talking about is a living experience of being no one. Out of that
nothingness, a life arises full of music, but the music is soundless;
full of beauty, but the beauty is formless; full of joy, but the joy is
indefinable; full of dance, but there is no movement.</p><p>A meditator knows something that mind is not capable of knowing
about. The mind only knows the superficial, and the superficial is
always dual; it is divided for and against.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothingness is non-dual, it is not divided. It is just pure silence,
but a very alive silence. And if out of that silence anything happens,
that has a beauty and a truth which anything created by the mind cannot
be compared with.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of silence – he may not even do anything, but just his silence
is a blessing to the whole existence. His silence is a music only heard
by those who have gone deeper and beyond the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>The sutra:</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>SEKISHITSU WAS A DISCIPLE OF CHOSHI. ON A VISIT TO SEKITO, THE MONK,
SEKISHITSU, BECAME ENLIGHTENED. AFTER HIS ENLIGHTENMENT, SEKISHITSU WENT
BACK TO HIS MASTER, CHOSHI. CHOSHI HAD ALSO BEEN A DISCIPLE OF
SEKITO.</p><p><br></p><p>CHOSHI SAID, “DID YOU REACH SEKITO?”</p><p><br></p><p>SEKISHITSU REPLIED, “YES, I DID, BUT WAS NOT INTRODUCED.” CHOSHI
SAID, “WHO DID YOU RECEIVE PRECEPTS FROM?” SEKISHITSU REPLIED, “NOT FROM
HIM.”</p><p>Do you see the mysterious way Sekishitsu is replying? When asked,
“DID YOU REACH SEKITO?” he said, “YES, I DID, BUT WAS NOT INTRODUCED,
because neither has he a form nor have I a form. Neither has he a name
nor have I a name. There is no possibility of introduction.”</p><p><br></p><p>Choshi said, “WHO DID YOU RECEIVE PRECEPTS FROM?” – then from whom
have you received the teachings?</p><p><br></p><p>Sekishitsu replied, “NOT FROM HIM – I have received, but I have
received from a nothingness. To me, my master was not a man of words. We
met beyond the words. We looked into each other’s eyes and something
transpired. But he has not said a single word; that is why I cannot say
that I have received any teachings from him. Of course, being with him I
have become enlightened.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sekishitsu became enlightened just by seeing Sekito. Nothing was
verbally said to him; neither did he become a disciple, nor did he
become initiated. Just watching Sekito... just seeing that pillar of
silence, that nothingness – and he simply disappeared as a being,
himself; he became a nothing. And without saying a word, he left Sekito
and went back to his master, Choshi.</p><p><br></p><p>Choshi became enlightened also in the company of Sekito. That is why
he is interested in asking what has happened: “DID YOU REACH SEKITO? –
because you look as if you have not only reached him, but you have found
him. You have penetrated his being; you are carrying his fragrance. What
is the matter? DID YOU REACH SEKITO?”</p><p>SEKISHITSU REPLIED, “YES, I DID, BUT WAS NOT INTRODUCED. Nothing was
said by him, and</p><p>nothing was said by me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Choshi said, “Then from whom did you receive the precepts? You seem
to have realized the purity of consciousness. You cannot deceive me; I
can see you are no more. How did it happen? Who told you the precepts –
the techniques, the methods, the disciplines?”</p><p><br></p><p>Sekishitsu replied, again in a roundabout way, “NOT FROM HIM.”</p><p><br></p><p>CHOSHI THEN SAID, “IF YOU WERE LIKE THAT THERE, WHAT WILL YOU BE
HERE? If you have</p><p>not received the teachings, the disciplines, the precepts from a
great master, Sekito, what kind of person are you going to be here? IF
YOU WERE LIKE THAT THERE, WHAT WILL YOU BE HERE?”</p><p><br></p><p>SEKISHITSU SAID, “NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE. I will be the same. Neither
time makes any difference, nor space makes any difference. I was no one
there, I will be no one here.”</p><p><br></p><p>SEKISHITSU SAID, “NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE.”</p><p><br></p><p>Choshi could not understand this roundabout way of talking; he was a
simple man of Zen. He said, “THAT IS TOO MUCH if you are going to be the
same here too. Here you have to follow the precepts; here you have to
meditate. Here you have to enter into the world of Zen.”</p><p><br></p><p>But Choshi was not a great master of Zen, he was a man of Zen. He has
understood nothingness, but he was not capable of conveying it. He said,
“THAT IS TOO MUCH if you are not going to be any different here.”</p><p><br></p><p>SEKISHITSU SAID, “MY TONGUE HAS NO COLOR YET.” He is saying, “Don’t
be worried. I am as pure as a child. I have not been programmed by
anyone. I am a tabula rasa, a clean slate. My tongue has no color
yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>CHOSHI REPLIED, “YOU NOISY NOVICE” – because according to Choshi,
this young man was just a novice. He could not penetrate and see in this
novice the transformation that had happened in the companionship of
Sekito.</p><p><br></p><p>He was an ordinary man of Zen who had followed precepts, principles,
step by step. He could not understand this quantum leap – a pure jump.
That was too much. He thought, “This man is too noisy. I am asking
simple questions; he goes on in a roundabout way. GO AWAY!” AND
SEKISHITSU IMMEDIATELY WENT AWAY.</p><p><br></p><p>This anecdote is very strange. Its strangeness is that it is not
necessary that a man of Zen will be able to understand another man of
Zen. Of course, a master will be able to understand all kinds of Zen
people, but a master is multidimensional, and a man of Zen is only
one-dimensional. He has followed a certain path, and he thinks only by
following that path does one reach to the nothingness he has
reached.</p><p><br></p><p>If one has to reach nothingness, any path will do. There are as many
paths as there are people to travel. But to understand that, a great
master is needed.</p><p>There have been enlightened people, but still they could not
understand other enlightened people for the simple reason that they have
followed a certain path and the other fellow has not followed that
particular path. They have become too conditioned by the path. They
cannot see that when you are going into nothingness, every path is the
right path.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are going somewhere, every path is not the right path, but
when you are going nowhere, every path is the right path. But to
understand that every path finally leads into nothingness, needs a
multidimensional consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>There are masters, and there are mystics, and this is the difference:
the mystic can understand only one-dimensionally; the master has a wider
view, a bird’s-eye view. He can look from above and see that all paths
are leading to nowhere.</p><p><br></p><p>Choshi could not understand Sekishitsu. Sekishitsu left him
immediately; this was not the right place for him. He had already gone
beyond the paths and the precepts and the scriptures.</p><p><br></p><p>Kyorai wrote:</p><p><br></p><p>IMMOBILE HAZE. MOON, SPRING, SLEEP.</p><p>He is saying this is what life is: “Immobile haze. Moon, spring,
sleep” – simple, no complication.</p><p><br></p><p>A sannyasin lives a life of such simplicity: the moon, the spring,
the sleep – and he is fulfilled. A little immobile haze, and then arises
the moon, then comes the spring – there are flowers – and then the
sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can conceive life in such simple terms – a little dance, a
little love, a little playfulness, a little laughter, a little music,
and then comes the eternal sleep, life becomes just a small drama. Soon
the drama will be over. The acceptance that the drama will be over, that
we are just players in a game which is not going to last forever – we
will have to vacate the place for other players – then life becomes very
simple, without any complexity and without any competition. One lives
silently, peacefully, and prepares himself for the eternal peace, the
eternal silence, the eternal sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha’s question:</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>FRITJOF CAPRA CONTENDS THAT, “MODERN PHYSICS GOES FAR BEYOND
TECHNOLOGY. THE WAY – OR TAO – OF PHYSICS CAN BE A PATH WITH A HEART, A
WAY TO SPIRITUAL REALIZATION.”</p><p><br></p><p>DO YOU AGREE?</p><p>Maneesha, the question is not of agreeing or not agreeing, because
all agreements and disagreements are of the mind. I know that Capra is
simply guessing. He is a man who knows modern physics and a little bit
of the philosophy of Tao. And it is a very small thing to create a
physics of Tao, or a Tao of physics, because the word tao simply means
the way, and modern physics certainly has gone beyond technology. It has
moved beyond the boundaries of mind, and is in a tremendous chaos. As
far as mind was concerned, things were clear. But now, modern physics
has come to a point where mind cannot make any sense. Capra himself,
being a physicist, started learning about Tao in the effort to
understand the chaos that modern physics has entered into, and that
perhaps Tao may help.</p><p><br></p><p>But he is not a man of Tao, he is still an intellectual trying to
make some definitions, trying to make something out of the chaos. He is
still thinking of spiritual realization, and there is no spiritual
realization because there is no spirit as such.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a dispersion into nothingness. You cannot call it
realization. It can be called DErealization, but it cannot be called
realization. Nothing is realized. Even that which was there is no more –
only silence prevails.</p><p><br></p><p>I know the chaos of existence is ultimate. Every effort to bring it
into a system is bound to fail. Philosophies have failed, science has
failed. More efforts will be made, but I can predict with absolute
authority that no system is going to explain this vast existence. It is
bound to remain a mystery.</p><p><br></p><p>Religions have tried in their own way, but failed. Philosophies have
failed. Science came with great systematic logic, and in the beginning
of this century science was absolutely certain that it was going to
succeed and explain away the whole mystery of existence, bring it down
to rationalization. But on the contrary, the opposite has happened.</p><p><br></p><p>As science has approached deeper into reality, all its old concepts
have become invalid. Now Aristotelian logic is no longer logic, and
Euclidean geometry is no longer geometry. Now, science is at a point
where everything again has become mysterious – no explanation, and no
reason. But the effort continues.</p><p><br></p><p>My approach is totally different. I want you to know that chaos is
the very nature of existence, you cannot make it a cosmos. You cannot
make it a system, either by Tao or by Zen. You cannot make it an
explained system where everything is knowable.</p><p><br></p><p>I have always divided existence into three segments: the known, the
unknown, and the unknowable. That which is unknown will become known
tomorrow.</p><p>That which is known today was unknown yesterday. But the known and
the unknown are a very superficial part. Beyond both is the unknowable.
That unknowable is a chaos; it is irrational, illogical. There is no way
to bring it into explanations, no way to make a science of it, or a
philosophy of it. This chaos I have called nothingness. You can enter
into it, you can be one with it, you can rejoice in it, but don’t try to
conceptualize it.</p><p>So it is not a question, Maneesha, of my agreement or disagreement
with Fritjof Capra. I know existence is a chaos, and will remain always
a chaos. All efforts of man are bound to fail in systematizing it. It is
not a system; it is not mechanics. Hence, I always have loved Gautam
Buddha’s statement. Asked, “What is truth?” he replied in a very strange
way. He said, “Whatever works.” He did not define truth, he simply said,
“Whatever works is true.”</p><p><br></p><p>And more than that, even today we don’t know. We don’t know what
electricity is, we only know how it works; we don’t know what it is.
There is no way to know it, and there is no need.</p><p><br></p><p>Let existence function.</p><p><br></p><p>Use it, love it, rejoice in it. There is no need to systematize it;
all systems are bound to fail. Zen is not a system, it is a path towards
the chaos.</p><p>Go dancingly in without bothering and worrying what it is. Rejoice in
it!</p><p>What is the point in thinking what is music? Love it, listen to it,
create it.</p><p>What is the point of finding the definition of dance? Dance!</p><p>But still very few people are of the age, mature enough to recognize
this immense chaos without fear, and to use it as much as you can. Love
it, live it, and drop the childish idea that you have to understand it.
What are you going to do by understanding it? And in the first place,
understanding is not possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is too small, and existence is too vast – without any
boundaries. There is no possibility that there will ever be a system
which explains everything. And that will be a very fatal day if some
system explains everything – life will lose all joy.</p><p><br></p><p>People are trying to explain everything. Then love becomes just
chemistry, biology, hormones. Do you ever think about love as hormones,
as biology, as chemistry? And the moment you think about chemistry,
biology, hormones, love loses all mystery. And certainly love is more
than chemistry, biology, or hormones can explain. They may explain sex,
but they cannot explain love.</p><p><br></p><p>Love need not be sexual. In fact, at the highest point even sexuality
transforms into love... love unexplained, irrational, a chaos. You can
experience it, but you cannot explain it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is time for Sardar Gurudayal Singh.…</p><p><br></p><p>It is a sunny afternoon in the rose garden of the Vatican in Rome.
Pope the Polack is deep in discussion with a smart-looking gentleman in
a three-piece suit, carrying a black briefcase.</p><p>“I am prepared to offer you one million dollars!” exclaims Herman
Hoover, the businessman. “No way,” says the papal fruitcake. “One
billion dollars, and no less!”</p><p>“Okay,” says Herman, “our last offer – five hundred million
dollars!”</p><p><br></p><p>“No way!” cries the Polack, stomping his foot. “Six hundred million!
One dollar for every Catholic or the deal is off!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Holy shit! Let us forget the whole thing,” shouts Herman. And the
businessman walks off in frustration.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, old Mario the gardener, pops his head over the rosebushes
and calls out to the pope. “Hey-a, Your Holiness!” says Mario. “That-a
guy wanted to give you so much-a money. Why did-a you refuse?”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t understand,” says the Polack. “You don’t know what that
guy wanted me to do.” “So?” asks Mario. “What-a did he want?”</p><p>“Well,” says the pope, “he wants us to change the end of the Lord’s
Prayer.” “Really?” asks Mario. “But-a, at the end-a we always say-a,
amen.”</p><p>“I know,” snaps the Polack pope. “But this guy wants us all to say,
Coca-Cola!”</p><p><br></p><p>It is that fateful night in old Jerusalem town. Upstairs at the
downtown MacDonald’s burger house, Jesus is host at his famous farewell
dinner party.</p><p><br></p><p>Ronald MacDonald, the clown, is running around giving everyone party
hats and whistles, trying to get the serious saints to laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>But Jesus has been looking moody all night when suddenly, he puts
down his wineglass and shouts across the smoke-filled room, “Peter!” he
cries, pointing his finger. “Peter! Tonight, you are going to betray
me!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah no, Lord!” calls back Peter, turning pale, “I would never betray
you!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, Peter,” says Jesus, “I was just checking up on you. Come over
here and eat some bread and drink some wine with me.”</p><p><br></p><p>So they eat bread and drink some wine. And then Jesus says, “Okay,
Peter, you can go.” Then Jesus looks around the room again, and calls
John, his beloved disciple.</p><p>“John!” shouts Jesus. “John! Tonight you are going to betray me!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah no, Lord!” replies John, falling off his seat in shock. “I would
never betray you. It is just not possible!”</p><p>“Okay, John,” replies Jesus. “Don’t get excited! I was just checking.
Come over here and drink wine and eat some bread with me!”</p><p><br></p><p>As the evening progresses, one by one, Jesus calls his apostles to
him, eating some bread and drinking wine with each of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, his wandering eye rests on Judas, who has been sitting in
the corner for the past hour, making out with Mary Magdelena.</p><p><br></p><p>“Judas!” shouts Jesus.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Lord!” replies Judas, straightening his shirt. “Judas!” cries
Jesus. “Come here! I want you!”</p><p>“Yes, Lord,” says Judas, jumping up and standing nervously in front
of Jesus. “Judas!” says Jesus. “Tonight, you are going to betray
me!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, Jesus Christ!” cries Judas. “Why do you always pick on me when
you get drunk?” Sexy Miss Thornbum, the primary school teacher, wiggles
into the classroom one morning.</p><p>“Now, children,” she announces, “today, we are going to start a whole
new and exciting subject called Sex Education!”</p><p><br></p><p>There is a loud cheering from the boys, and excited squealing from
the girls as Miss Thornbum claps her hands to restore order.</p><p><br></p><p>“Settle down, children!” shouts Miss Thornbum. “Soon, you little boys
will be getting interested in some little girls, and some of you little
girls will have your little eyes on some little boys.”</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, Little Albert interrupts. “Hey, Miss Thornbum!” he shouts.
“And for us Little guys who are already screwing – can we go out and
play football?”</p><p><br></p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat) Be
silent.…</p><p>Close your eyes... and feel your bodies to be completely frozen.</p><p>This is the right moment to enter in.</p><p><br></p><p>Gather all your energies, all your consciousness, and rush towards
the inner center of your being. It is exactly two inches below the
navel, inside you. In Japan they call it hara.</p><p><br></p><p>Rush towards this hara with absolute urgency as if this is going to
be your last moment. Faster and faster...</p><p>Deeper and deeper...</p><p><br></p><p>As you start coming close to the hara, a great silence descends over
you. And inside, the whole interior becomes luminous.</p><p><br></p><p>At the very center there is a flame, the eternal flame of life. This
eternal flame of light is your very source, and is also going to be your
goal.</p><p><br></p><p>As you come closer and closer to the flame, everything becomes
peaceful inside, but a peace that is alive, a silence that is a music,
and an experience which allows you to become a witness.</p><p><br></p><p>Witness that you are not the body. Witness that you are not the
mind.</p><p>Witness that you are only a witness, a pure witness and nothing
else.</p><p><br></p><p>Deepening into this witnessing, one disappears into the ultimate
chaos of existence. That is the greatest bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>Make the witnessing deeper and deeper. Nivedano...</p><p>(Drumbeat) Relax...</p><p>Just remain a witness and melt like ice melting into the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>Let this Gautama the Buddha Auditorium become an ocean of
consciousness. You are no more, only a consciousness pervading,
prevailing.</p><p>You are drowned into the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the most refreshing experience, and the most transforming
experience. This experience makes buddhas out of you.</p><p>A buddha is one who has come to be at ease with existence. These
three steps may be significant for you.…</p><p>First, the flame follows you. The flame is represented symbolically
by the buddha. In the East the face of the buddha has become a symbol of
our ultimate nature.</p><p><br></p><p>In the first step you will find the buddha following you.</p><p><br></p><p>In the second step, you will find yourself following the buddha as a
shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>In the third step, even the shadow disappears, only the luminous
buddha remains. And this luminosity is eternal and immortal, can be
experienced but cannot be explained.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who have experienced it, their life has become a light, a joy,
a bliss, and a blessing for all those who have come into their contact.
In other words, their life becomes a love, a song, a dance, for no
reason at all.</p><p><br></p><p>This great experiment is being done here.</p><p><br></p><p>You are the most fortunate people in the world this moment, because
everybody is busy in the mundane – you are looking for the sacred and
the ultimate.</p><p><br></p><p>Before Nivedano calls you back, collect all this experience, this
silence, this peace, these flowers that are showering on you – this
music, and this luminosity. And persuade the buddha to come with you, to
become part of your everyday existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Come back, but with the same grace, the same silence, the same
beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>Sit for a few moments just to remember what space you entered into,
what golden path you have followed.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is not a question just to do meditation at some time of the
day. Meditation has to become your very breathing.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever you have been in these silent moments, you can be
twenty-four hours... an undercurrent of joy, peace, love,
compassion.</p><p><br></p><p>In whatever you are doing, you can do it as if you are a buddha. The
“as if” will disappear soon, because fundamentally you are buddhas. It
is not something that you have to achieve, it is something that you have
forgotten and you have to remember it – sammasati.</p><p>Okay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

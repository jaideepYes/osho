HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR PEOPLE TO REALIZE THAT ONE OF THE ROOT CAUSES OF THIS STUPID CATASTROPHE IS THAT THE SYSTEMS OF LIFE THAT THEY SO AVIDLY SUPPORT HAVE NO LEADERS WHO ARE CAPABLE OF BOWING DOWN TO WISDOM?\nIt won’t take long for them to realize the catastrophic situation they are in.\nThere is a limit to everything. People can tolerate up to a point, but if it becomes a question of life and death, then there is a sudden outburst of intelligence in ordinary people. You would never have expected it.\nThe people who are in power are not going to the people of wisdom, ever. Power corrupts so deeply and gives such a big ego that even to ask advice becomes impossible.\nThe revolution is going to happen not through the powerful people but through the common people – and they have tolerated enough. And it is coming to a climax. The climax is on one hand very painful; but on the other hand it is a new beginning, a fresh beginning.\nIt is true that people’s lives are loveless. They don’t have any joy in their work. They are bored, they don’t feel any meaning in their life. They are just running like robots. Their cities are no longer places of beauty, and nature has been destroyed very deeply.\nAll these things together come to one point, the central point; and that is that the people have depended too much on people who have power. It has been almost a kind of slavery.\nIt is time to revolt and throw out these people who have power, and to destroy the whole system of power. There is no need for them, because they are not doing anything except destroying more and more qualities which make life worth living.\nSecondly, people have to understand that the people they have been thinking are wise are not so. In fact most of their misery is because of those “wise” people and the powerful people; they both need to be overthrown.\nThe common man has to assert himself and common sense has to prevail. It does not need great wisdom, it only needs common sense.\nFor example, people’s lives are loveless – there is no need to ask any wise man why, because they are the people who have made it loveless. Just common insight is enough.\nMen and women are not naturally made to live their whole life together. It is not only a question of men and women; it is that the same thing continuously repeated creates boredom – the same husband, the same wife, the same quarrel, the same argument, the same tantrum – exactly the same! It goes on being repeated again and again. It destroys the very possibility of love. Instead it creates boredom – it has created it.\nThe common-sense thing is that there should be no marriage and there should be no divorce. Any two persons loving each other can live together, that is their private affair – nothing to do with society, nothing to do with the state. The law should not come between them.\nThere should be no promises except that, “We will love each other as long as existence allows it. The moment we feel that love has left – that it is no longer there connecting us, no longer there nourishing us – we have to part quickly, before it becomes bitterness, a quarrel. And we have to depart in gratitude, with all our heart’s blessings full for the other – that she or he will find a better man or a better woman.” And boredom will disappear; life will become a series of excitements.\nBoredom is in getting stuck at one point – repeating, repeating, repeating. Joy is in exploration – finding new people, new spaces. It is simple common sense.\nPeople are bored in their job because they allowed others to decide their job; their parents wanted them to be a doctor, so they are a doctor. They never had any inner urge to be a doctor, and they never listened to their inner voice.\nIt is never too late; they can start listening to their inner voice. And it is better to drop a job and do the thing they always wanted to do. It may be a loss in salary; economically it may not be good, but spiritually it is going to take away the boredom. And what are you going to do with the money, with\nall the facilities that the job gives you, if you are utterly bored? It is better to be a beggar but not bored, than to be an emperor and be bored.\nThese are common-sense insights.\nThe cities are becoming bigger and bigger. The villages are disappearing, and with the disappearing villages the pure air, the unpolluted atmosphere – that is disappearing.\nPeople should just see it; they should start moving towards the villages. They should start doing farming, gardening; and there are thousands of other things. It just needs a little courage.\nThe city has no future.\nSmall villages can convert themselves into communes, which would give them a new structure, which would make people free of children and would make the children free of parental power. And they could have more fresh food, fresh water, fresh air.\nThere were all running to the city for one thing – because it gives money, and the villages cannot give money. Why have villages been disappearing, and big, monstrous cities coming up? The reason is that everybody is after money, not understanding a simple thing, that money cannot buy anything that makes life a beautiful, blissful pilgrimage. It can buy many things, but they are useless if the man himself loses his soul.\nIf the cities disappear into villages, much of the pollution will also disappear. The cities are almost like a canceric growth, that goes on growing bigger and bigger. The people in power cannot do anything because their power needs money – not love, not blissfulness, not joy – just money.\nAnd your so-called wise people are nothing but politicians in another garb of religious heads; their whole interest is also in power. It is a different kind of power, more subtle, but all the same it is power. They would not like the cities to disappear.\nTheir power depends on the boredom of man, his loveless life, his meaningless life, his anguish, because these are the things which bring people to their feet – to the churches, to the temples, to the synagogues. They may say great things, but basically they don’t want these things to disappear. If these things completely disappeared, churches would be empty and nobody would go to the synagogue – there is no reason to go... you go to the physician because you are sick.\nThere is a certain vested interest that the physician has in your sickness. I have heard of a young man who had just come home from medical college. His father was not feeling well. He said, “I would like to rest for a few days. And now you are back fully qualified... I am proud of you, that you topped the university – now you take care of the dispensary.”\nAfter three days the son came and told the father, “You must be proud of me! That old woman – the richest in the city, whom you have been treating for thirty years – I have treated her in three days. Now she is perfectly okay.”\nThe father said “My God! She is the woman who has paid all your fees and all your expenses at medical college. She is also paying the expenses of your younger brother in college. You have destroyed half of my business!\n“You idiot, don’t you know that when a poor man comes you should cure him immediately, because he is going to be an unnecessary harassment. When a rich man comes, take time – there is no hurry. If one illness disappears, let another appear. A really rich man should be a lifelong patient. This is a basic rule of the profession. You have learned medicine, but you have not learned the medical profession.”\nThe priest has a vested interest in man’s misery.\nAnd it is really unbelievable, but it is the truth: the magistrate has a vested interest in criminals, the advocates have a vested interest in criminals. They are supposed to do justice, they are supposed to be fair; but basically their profession is based on these poor people. If everybody is a nice, good gentleman and there is no criminal anywhere, what are all your magistrates, all your jailers, all your advocates, and all your legal professionals going to do? They will have to commit suicide – their whole profession will be gone.\nThe common people have to understand this simple thing. They should move back to the villages because money has not given anything... more gadgets, but gadgets don’t create love, don’t create freedom, don’t create joy. Go to the villages, make small communes.\nAnd to work with nature is a healthy thing. All the jobs that the city provides are unhealthy, because people are sitting the whole day in chairs. Man is not made for that; his body is made for at least eight hours’ physical labor. Basically he was a hunter, running after wild and fast animals. And that was his food. He managed for thousands of years, and naturally he had a certain health that modern man cannot afford. If you don’t use a certain part of your body, that part slowly becomes useless; then you cannot use it.\nPeople have to move back to the villages, to the forest, to the mountains. It will be a hard life, but it will be natural, it will be beautiful, it will have a joy. And they should make small communes, so love need not be a forced thing.\nOrdinarily marriage is nothing but licensed prostitution. This is ugly.\nExcept for love there should be no other thing between two persons.\nIn the villages, in the mountains, in the communes, the woman will have a similar kind of work to the man. She will not be financially dependent on man; she will be producing, she will be creative.\nAnd let the cities die. It happened many times in the past – it can happen again. There is no necessity for anything to live forever.\nI have seen a few places in India.In one place I was staying in a government guesthouse. Now it\nis just a small hill station, the population of the city today is only ninety. These are the people who serve the visitors, the tourists. There was a time that the city had a unimaginable population, looking at today’s population of ninety: it had hundreds of thousands of people.\nIt was one of the biggest cities, Mandu. And you can find the proof in the ruins. There are mosques where ten thousand people can pray together. There are caravanserai – just ruins – where thousands of camels could have an overnight stay. And if you look from the top, all over the mountain there are ruins as far as you can see.\nI asked a man who was my friend and was living there... there is a great palace and other small palaces and a beautiful lake. I said, “What happened to the city? This big city suddenly disappeared without any war.”\nHe said, “This city was the camels’ route, and in that day camels were the vehicles that carried the goods from one place to another. So from Kabul to Indore this was the only route. Thousands of camels moved through here continuously, and the city was flourishing. But then things changed.”\nThe camel was found to no longer be an adequate means to take goods from one place to another, so bullock carts replaced the camel. But the route that goes through Mandu is a desert; only camels can go on that route, bullock carts cannot. They had to find a new route. Bullock carts were cheaper; naturally camels were abandoned. With their abandonment, the route that passed through Mandu was abandoned.\nMandu lost its source of money, and people had to go away. What could you do there? On that mountain you cannot grow anything – they lived only on the constant traffic. Such a huge city simply disappeared! People left their houses and moved to places where they could earn something.\nIt is only a question of a simple understanding: cities are now killing people with pollution, with AIDS, with other diseases. It will be good if people move into the open air, with nature.\nAnd the needs of man are not so many, the needs of man are very limited – just his ego has an unlimited desire for more and more and more. The ego has created the whole problem. And on the way it has destroyed many human qualities.\nIn a big city you are in a crowd, but still a stranger. And everybody is in such a hurry: everybody is running from job to home, from home to job, and it may be miles. He has to catch his train, his bus. Nobody has time for strangers, nobody even says hello to a stranger.\nIn a small village everybody is known to everybody else. Everybody is in some way related to somebody else. There is a friendship – in a real sense a commune, because there is a communication. People are not islands. If somebody falls ill the whole village will come to enquire. If somebody is not in good enough health to work in the fields, then the whole village will help him. This is simply human. Because he has helped others, others will help him – it is a simple phenomenon.\nAnd with my idea of love not being a static thing, the village can become a paradise, self-sufficient. And man has to choose – he has come to the point where he will have to choose: Do you want love? Do you want a meaningful life? Do you want blissfulness? Or you can choose to have dead gadgets, new mechanisms.\nAnd the answer is simple. What will you do with machines? Man needs human energy.\nI am not against machines. But I am saying that the emphasis should be on human relationship. Machines can be used if they are not against human relationship, if they are not against ecology. If they are against ecology, if they are against human relationship, then they are not to exist at all.\nNeither the people in power are going to do it, nor are the so-called saints and wise people going to do it. They are both conspirators. They both depend on your pain, misery, meaninglessness. They cannot do anything.\nThey also depend on the industrialist, because in their elections the industrialist will be the one who will give the money. So they cannot go against the industries that are polluting the air, cutting the trees, destroying the ecology, poisoning the water, the rivers, the lakes, even the oceans. They cannot do it, because if they do it, their own money that they will need at election time will not be available.\nFor the first time the common man has to stand on his own legs and depend on his own common sense. And these are simple, common-sense things – they don’t need great wisdom.\nThis whole life on the planet can go through a great revolution without any bloodshed. Just a pure understanding will become the revolution.\nAnd if people start moving away from the cities, deserting them, they will cut the people of power off from their money sources – because who is going to run their industries and factories? They will cut the power of the religious heads – because who is going to gather in their cathedrals and synagogues?\nAnd my understanding of religion is that it needs no synagogues, no temples, no churches. It is a simple heart-to-heart communion with nature. You can sit by the side of a river and meditate, you can sit in the mountains and meditate. And as you become aware of the knack of meditation then you can continue to work and meditate. Then there is no conflict, and no question of time.\nAnd meditation is neither Hindu nor Mohammedan, nor Christian. Meditation is simply a science. Just as science is not Christian, and science is not Hindu, and science is not Buddhist.It would\nbe a mad world if there were Buddhist chemistry and Hindu chemistry and Christian chemistry – people would simply laugh because the laws of chemistry are the same.\nThe same is true about the inner science – which has been known up to now as religion. The methods of reaching to your innermost center are scientific; there is no question of any adjective, they are the same. It is absolutely unnecessary to call them Christian or Hindu.\nThe common person has a tremendous power in his hands. If he moves into small communes, deserts the cities which are dying, which are nothing but citadels of crimeIf he moves away, he\ntakes the power of the powerful and the wisdom of the so-called wise.\nAnd it is beautiful to have a small commune where everybody knows everybody else, understands everybody; where everybody is ready to help, is always available in times when there is need.\nIn a city you are absolutely alone. You may be living in the same building and you may not yet have been introduced; in one building thousands of people are living. And the city life is so speedy that there is no time to sit and gossip, to play cards or to play music, or to have a communal dance. All those beautiful things have disappeared. In small communes we can revive everything that was of beauty.\nI have been to aboriginal tribes... the whole day they will be working in their fields or in the mines. But by the evening, after their meals, they will all gather in the middle of the village with all their instruments. They will have music and they will have dance – and it will continue late into the night.\nIt was so beautiful to see that they have not become mechanical. They do the work which is needed for their food; otherwise they enjoy their time. They will play cards... and in a small place, where maybe fifty people, a hundred people are living, they will all gather together gossiping. There is something human in it.\nThe city has made the human being inhuman.\nBut the revolution that has to come, has to come from the common people themselves. The powerful people – whether in wisdom or in political power – are too involved in this system. They cannot change it; they will go on making it grow. And the common man will be crushed – he is being crushed.\nHouses have become just boxes – boxes upon boxes. They don’t have the beauty of a house. They are no longer houses; the space has gone on shrinking. Small rooms which perhaps are not natural... they are claustrophobic. And every being, man or animal, has a territorial imperative – an area of big space around himself where he is totally free to move.\nScientists have discovered that the most difficult thing for animals in zoos is that they lose their territory. If you go to a zoo and see a lion, you will be simply surprised: he is simply going round and round, round and round in his cage. What is he doing? He is trying, by traveling so much, to deceive himself that he has his territory.\nAll the animals, lions... and we know about dogs because they are more common. You may never have thought about why they do it – dogs will go on pissing on this pole, on that pole, on this stone.… If you watch, the same dog will do the same thing on the same pole, on the same stone every day – because animals are very very sensitive in their smell. He is creating a boundary: “Beware, this area belongs to me!”\nHe is creating a fence of smell. You may not smell it, but other dogs smell it: it is dangerous to enter. And it has been observed that if another dog comes, he immediately stops at an invisible barrier and thinks twice, whether to enter or not. And the dog inside looks at him, but he is not agitated or ferocious or angry because the other dog is still outside his territory. One step in and he will go mad. He knows where the territory is, the outside dog knows where the territory is.\nAnd in jungles, all animals make their territories the same way, and most of their territories are respected by other animals. But you put them in a zoo, in a small cage, and you destroy their freedom. Perhaps something of their soul is crushed.\nWhat about man?\nIf all animals have a territory, a certain territory, a determinable territory – if lions have only that much territory, all the lions – then what about man? It is not possible that he has no territorial imperative. He also has it. But in the crowds of a city how can he manage a territory? And if he cannot manage a space around himself, perhaps he is losing something of his inner being too.\nSo it is not strange that when you go out of the city, in the open – in the forest, near the ocean, or in the mountains – suddenly you feel an expansion of being. That expansion of being is a very scientific phenomenon – nothing poetic. It is your territory; there, you can have it.\nThe world is big enough still – people can move. They have moved to the cities because they are center of money. If they understand only one thing – that money cannot buy anything of value, and you have lost everything, running after money.…\nGo back! Go to the world where you belong – to the trees, to the animals, to the rivers, to the mountains.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nIS IT OKAY TO HAVE A SECRET?\nIt is a complicated question.\nFor a man like me it is not okay to have a secret. There is nothing to hide. Everything should be made available to people, everything should be shared. So the awakened person cannot have a secret.\nBut the unawakened person is bound to have secrets, for the simple reason that he is living in a mad world – he has not been able to raise his consciousness above it. If he opens his secrets to other people, they may exploit him, they may take advantage of it – they are certainly going to take advantage of it.\nSo for the unawakened it is okay to have secrets; otherwise he will be creating so many troubles for himself that he may not be able to manage them.\nJust one thing he has to remember: if he loves someone he should not have any secrets with the person he loves, because every secret is a barrier. If you love a person, then there should be nothing in you that the person is not allowed to know. Between the two of you there should not be anything private, secretive. That is part, an essential part of love.\nBut that is only between two persons who love each other. In love they have become almost one – there is no question of keeping a secret. But to the world at large it is not needed to open your secrets. Nobody is asking, nobody is bothered; and why should you open your secrets? And your secrets will give them power over you.\nThe Catholic church has a tradition of confession: every Catholic has to confess to the priest what sins he has committed. This is a very cunning strategy, because the priest knows all your secrets, all your sins. You cannot leave the fold, otherwise he can expose you.\nYou have given your power into his hands.\nJust a few months ago, the pope announced to the Catholics that one of the greatest sins is to confess to God directly. You have to confess through the priest, otherwise it is a sin.\nWhy should it be a sin if somebody confesses to God directly? But the pope’s concern is that if people start confessing directly to God, then who is going to confess to the priest? It is embarrassing. And then the priest’s power over people will be lost. So you have committed one sin; you are committing a greater sin if you confess to God directly. A mediator, a priest is an absolute necessity.\nIn politics it is an everyday affair. In India, the first prime minister remained in power long enough to know everybody’s weaknesses, everybody’s crimes; and he had maintained a file. That file was power: You cannot betray him, you cannot go against him; otherwise you will be in very great difficulty. He knows some secret that he can expose about you.\nWhen he died, the file went into the hands of his daughter. That was her power; otherwise she had no power. She was not a politician; but even without being a politician she maintained a tremendous power – more than her father. And the file went on growing bigger and bigger.\nAbout every politician in India they had every secret. Whatever they had been forgiven for had been reported; it could be exposed any moment, and the man would be finished. They may have been chief ministers, they may have been governors, they may have been cabinet ministers – but they were all puppets because of the file.\nAnd you will be surprised that when Sanjay Gandhi, Indira’s son, died in an accident just close to their house in an airplane, everybody rushed there. As Indira was informed, she rushed there. The most amazing thing is that she was not concerned about what had happened, how he died. What she was concerned about was: “Where are those two keys he was carrying?”\nThe son has died – can you think of a mother asking about two keys that he was carrying? And first she got hold of those two keys; only then she did make other enquiries.\nI have been told, those two keys were the keys to all the secret files against the politicians of India – because that was her power. If those two keys are lost then it will be a difficult job – first those two keysPerhaps one key was concerned with the files and the other key was concerned with\nthe money they were keeping in hiding. And this was a constant fight between Sanjay and Indira: he wanted those two keys.\nI don’t know exactly, but people who knew their house and their inner workings say that he even slapped his mother once because she was adamant and would not give him those two keys. And finally she had to give them to him because he was creating too much trouble for her. Just to console him, she gave him those two keys.\nAnd I don’t see that she was very much hurt by his death. Perhaps deep down she wanted it. He was not the man she wanted to replace her; her elder son was the person that she wanted to take her place. But whoever had all those secrets would be the prime minister. This is how, for forty years, one family has been ruling the whole country in the name of democracy – but it is really a dynasty. And if they go on keeping those secrets they may be able to continue.\nSo I will not say that you have to tell your secrets to everyone. In the first place, what is the need? But yes, if you love a person then don’t keep any secrets. It makes you closer, more intimate.\nBut if you become awakened, enlightened, then of course you are available to all, with no secrets. You should be an absolutely open book. Anybody can read it – because now you exist for others, your own existence is fulfilled. And nobody can exploit you, nobody can take advantage of you in any way.\nThe enlightened person is in a position to open himself totally, but nobody else is in that position.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"4879","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/light_on_the_path/part23/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/light_on_the_path/>Light on the Path</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">23 Cities have made the human being inhuman</h1><div class=post-meta>23 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;4879 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Light_on_the_Path/part23.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part22>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

THAT THE CITIES THEY LIVE IN VARY FROM INHOSPITABLE TO FRANKLY
DANGEROUS; THAT THE JOBS THEY DO (IF THEY ARE “LUCKY” ENOUGH TO HAVE
ONE) ARE DULL, BORING, AND MEANINGLESS; THAT THE RELATIONSHIPS THEY HAVE
ARE TOLERABLE AT THE BEST, AND LOVE IS A RARITY; AND THAT THE FUTURE
HOLDS VERY LITTLE TO LOOK FORWARD TO. HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR PEOPLE
TO REALIZE THAT ONE OF THE ROOT CAUSES OF THIS STUPID CATASTROPHE IS
THAT THE SYSTEMS OF LIFE THAT THEY SO AVIDLY SUPPORT HAVE NO LEADERS WHO
ARE CAPABLE OF BOWING DOWN TO WISDOM?</p><p>It won’t take long for them to realize the catastrophic situation
they are in.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a limit to everything. People can tolerate up to a point,
but if it becomes a question of life and death, then there is a sudden
outburst of intelligence in ordinary people. You would never have
expected it.</p><p><br></p><p>The people who are in power are not going to the people of wisdom,
ever. Power corrupts so deeply and gives such a big ego that even to ask
advice becomes impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>The revolution is going to happen not through the powerful people but
through the common people – and they have tolerated enough. And it is
coming to a climax. The climax is on one hand very painful; but on the
other hand it is a new beginning, a fresh beginning.</p><p>It is true that people’s lives are loveless. They don’t have any joy
in their work. They are bored, they don’t feel any meaning in their
life. They are just running like robots. Their cities are no longer
places of beauty, and nature has been destroyed very deeply.</p><p><br></p><p>All these things together come to one point, the central point; and
that is that the people have depended too much on people who have power.
It has been almost a kind of slavery.</p><p><br></p><p>It is time to revolt and throw out these people who have power, and
to destroy the whole system of power. There is no need for them, because
they are not doing anything except destroying more and more qualities
which make life worth living.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, people have to understand that the people they have been
thinking are wise are not so. In fact most of their misery is because of
those “wise” people and the powerful people; they both need to be
overthrown.</p><p><br></p><p>The common man has to assert himself and common sense has to prevail.
It does not need great wisdom, it only needs common sense.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, people’s lives are loveless – there is no need to ask
any wise man why, because they are the people who have made it loveless.
Just common insight is enough.</p><p><br></p><p>Men and women are not naturally made to live their whole life
together. It is not only a question of men and women; it is that the
same thing continuously repeated creates boredom – the same husband, the
same wife, the same quarrel, the same argument, the same tantrum –
exactly the same! It goes on being repeated again and again. It destroys
the very possibility of love. Instead it creates boredom – it has
created it.</p><p><br></p><p>The common-sense thing is that there should be no marriage and there
should be no divorce. Any two persons loving each other can live
together, that is their private affair – nothing to do with society,
nothing to do with the state. The law should not come between them.</p><p><br></p><p>There should be no promises except that, “We will love each other as
long as existence allows it. The moment we feel that love has left –
that it is no longer there connecting us, no longer there nourishing us
– we have to part quickly, before it becomes bitterness, a quarrel. And
we have to depart in gratitude, with all our heart’s blessings full for
the other – that she or he will find a better man or a better woman.”
And boredom will disappear; life will become a series of
excitements.</p><p><br></p><p>Boredom is in getting stuck at one point – repeating, repeating,
repeating. Joy is in exploration – finding new people, new spaces. It is
simple common sense.</p><p><br></p><p>People are bored in their job because they allowed others to decide
their job; their parents wanted them to be a doctor, so they are a
doctor. They never had any inner urge to be a doctor, and they never
listened to their inner voice.</p><p><br></p><p>It is never too late; they can start listening to their inner voice.
And it is better to drop a job and do the thing they always wanted to
do. It may be a loss in salary; economically it may not be good, but
spiritually it is going to take away the boredom. And what are you going
to do with the money, with</p><p>all the facilities that the job gives you, if you are utterly bored?
It is better to be a beggar but not bored, than to be an emperor and be
bored.</p><p><br></p><p>These are common-sense insights.</p><p><br></p><p>The cities are becoming bigger and bigger. The villages are
disappearing, and with the disappearing villages the pure air, the
unpolluted atmosphere – that is disappearing.</p><p><br></p><p>People should just see it; they should start moving towards the
villages. They should start doing farming, gardening; and there are
thousands of other things. It just needs a little courage.</p><p><br></p><p>The city has no future.</p><p><br></p><p>Small villages can convert themselves into communes, which would give
them a new structure, which would make people free of children and would
make the children free of parental power. And they could have more fresh
food, fresh water, fresh air.</p><p><br></p><p>There were all running to the city for one thing – because it gives
money, and the villages cannot give money. Why have villages been
disappearing, and big, monstrous cities coming up? The reason is that
everybody is after money, not understanding a simple thing, that money
cannot buy anything that makes life a beautiful, blissful pilgrimage. It
can buy many things, but they are useless if the man himself loses his
soul.</p><p>If the cities disappear into villages, much of the pollution will
also disappear. The cities are almost like a canceric growth, that goes
on growing bigger and bigger. The people in power cannot do anything
because their power needs money – not love, not blissfulness, not joy –
just money.</p><p><br></p><p>And your so-called wise people are nothing but politicians in another
garb of religious heads; their whole interest is also in power. It is a
different kind of power, more subtle, but all the same it is power. They
would not like the cities to disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>Their power depends on the boredom of man, his loveless life, his
meaningless life, his anguish, because these are the things which bring
people to their feet – to the churches, to the temples, to the
synagogues. They may say great things, but basically they don’t want
these things to disappear. If these things completely disappeared,
churches would be empty and nobody would go to the synagogue – there is
no reason to go... you go to the physician because you are sick.</p><p>There is a certain vested interest that the physician has in your
sickness. I have heard of a young man who had just come home from
medical college. His father was not feeling well. He said, “I would like
to rest for a few days. And now you are back fully qualified... I am
proud of you, that you topped the university – now you take care of the
dispensary.”</p><p>After three days the son came and told the father, “You must be proud
of me! That old woman – the richest in the city, whom you have been
treating for thirty years – I have treated her in three days. Now she is
perfectly okay.”</p><p><br></p><p>The father said “My God! She is the woman who has paid all your fees
and all your expenses at medical college. She is also paying the
expenses of your younger brother in college. You have destroyed half of
my business!</p><p>“You idiot, don’t you know that when a poor man comes you should cure
him immediately, because he is going to be an unnecessary harassment.
When a rich man comes, take time – there is no hurry. If one illness
disappears, let another appear. A really rich man should be a lifelong
patient. This is a basic rule of the profession. You have learned
medicine, but you have not learned the medical profession.”</p><p><br></p><p>The priest has a vested interest in man’s misery.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is really unbelievable, but it is the truth: the magistrate
has a vested interest in criminals, the advocates have a vested interest
in criminals. They are supposed to do justice, they are supposed to be
fair; but basically their profession is based on these poor people. If
everybody is a nice, good gentleman and there is no criminal anywhere,
what are all your magistrates, all your jailers, all your advocates, and
all your legal professionals going to do? They will have to commit
suicide – their whole profession will be gone.</p><p><br></p><p>The common people have to understand this simple thing. They should
move back to the villages because money has not given anything... more
gadgets, but gadgets don’t create love, don’t create freedom, don’t
create joy. Go to the villages, make small communes.</p><p><br></p><p>And to work with nature is a healthy thing. All the jobs that the
city provides are unhealthy, because people are sitting the whole day in
chairs. Man is not made for that; his body is made for at least eight
hours’ physical labor. Basically he was a hunter, running after wild and
fast animals. And that was his food. He managed for thousands of years,
and naturally he had a certain health that modern man cannot afford. If
you don’t use a certain part of your body, that part slowly becomes
useless; then you cannot use it.</p><p><br></p><p>People have to move back to the villages, to the forest, to the
mountains. It will be a hard life, but it will be natural, it will be
beautiful, it will have a joy. And they should make small communes, so
love need not be a forced thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily marriage is nothing but licensed prostitution. This is
ugly.</p><p>Except for love there should be no other thing between two
persons.</p><p><br></p><p>In the villages, in the mountains, in the communes, the woman will
have a similar kind of work to the man. She will not be financially
dependent on man; she will be producing, she will be creative.</p><p><br></p><p>And let the cities die. It happened many times in the past – it can
happen again. There is no necessity for anything to live forever.</p><p><br></p><p>I have seen a few places in India.<span class=s4></span>In one
place I was staying in a government guesthouse. Now it</p><p>is just a small hill station, the population of the city today is
only ninety. These are the people who serve the visitors, the tourists.
There was a time that the city had a unimaginable population, looking at
today’s population of ninety: it had hundreds of thousands of
people.</p><p>It was one of the biggest cities, Mandu. And you can find the proof
in the ruins. There are mosques where ten thousand people can pray
together. There are caravanserai – just ruins – where thousands of
camels could have an overnight stay. And if you look from the top, all
over the mountain there are ruins as far as you can see.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked a man who was my friend and was living there... there is a
great palace and other small palaces and a beautiful lake. I said, “What
happened to the city? This big city suddenly disappeared without any
war.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “This city was the camels’ route, and in that day camels
were the vehicles that carried the goods from one place to another. So
from Kabul to Indore this was the only route. Thousands of camels moved
through here continuously, and the city was flourishing. But then things
changed.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>The camel was found to no longer be an adequate means to take goods
from one place to another, so bullock carts replaced the camel. But the
route that goes through Mandu is a desert; only camels can go on that
route, bullock carts cannot. They had to find a new route. Bullock carts
were cheaper; naturally camels were abandoned. With their abandonment,
the route that passed through Mandu was abandoned.</p><p><br></p><p>Mandu lost its source of money, and people had to go away. What could
you do there? On that mountain you cannot grow anything – they lived
only on the constant traffic. Such a huge city simply disappeared!
People left their houses and moved to places where they could earn
something.</p><p><br></p><p>It is only a question of a simple understanding: cities are now
killing people with pollution, with AIDS, with other diseases. It will
be good if people move into the open air, with nature.</p><p><br></p><p>And the needs of man are not so many, the needs of man are very
limited – just his ego has an unlimited desire for more and more and
more. The ego has created the whole problem. And on the way it has
destroyed many human qualities.</p><p><br></p><p>In a big city you are in a crowd, but still a stranger. And everybody
is in such a hurry: everybody is running from job to home, from home to
job, and it may be miles. He has to catch his train, his bus. Nobody has
time for strangers, nobody even says hello to a stranger.</p><p><br></p><p>In a small village everybody is known to everybody else. Everybody is
in some way related to somebody else. There is a friendship – in a real
sense a commune, because there is a communication. People are not
islands. If somebody falls ill the whole village will come to enquire.
If somebody is not in good enough health to work in the fields, then the
whole village will help him. This is simply human. Because he has helped
others, others will help him – it is a simple phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>And with my idea of love not being a static thing, the village can
become a paradise, self-sufficient. And man has to choose – he has come
to the point where he will have to choose: Do you want love? Do you want
a meaningful life? Do you want blissfulness? Or you can choose to have
dead gadgets, new mechanisms.</p><p><br></p><p>And the answer is simple. What will you do with machines? Man needs
human energy.</p><p>I am not against machines. But I am saying that the emphasis should
be on human relationship. Machines can be used if they are not against
human relationship, if they are not against ecology. If they are against
ecology, if they are against human relationship, then they are not to
exist at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Neither the people in power are going to do it, nor are the so-called
saints and wise people going to do it. They are both conspirators. They
both depend on your pain, misery, meaninglessness. They cannot do
anything.</p><p><br></p><p>They also depend on the industrialist, because in their elections the
industrialist will be the one who will give the money. So they cannot go
against the industries that are polluting the air, cutting the trees,
destroying the ecology, poisoning the water, the rivers, the lakes, even
the oceans. They cannot do it, because if they do it, their own money
that they will need at election time will not be available.</p><p><br></p><p>For the first time the common man has to stand on his own legs and
depend on his own common sense. And these are simple, common-sense
things – they don’t need great wisdom.</p><p><br></p><p>This whole life on the planet can go through a great revolution
without any bloodshed. Just a pure understanding will become the
revolution.</p><p>And if people start moving away from the cities, deserting them, they
will cut the people of power off from their money sources – because who
is going to run their industries and factories? They will cut the power
of the religious heads – because who is going to gather in their
cathedrals and synagogues?</p><p><br></p><p>And my understanding of religion is that it needs no synagogues, no
temples, no churches. It is a simple heart-to-heart communion with
nature. You can sit by the side of a river and meditate, you can sit in
the mountains and meditate. And as you become aware of the knack of
meditation then you can continue to work and meditate. Then there is no
conflict, and no question of time.</p><p><br></p><p>And meditation is neither Hindu nor Mohammedan, nor Christian.
Meditation is simply a science. Just as science is not Christian, and
science is not Hindu, and science is not Buddhist.<span class=s4></span>It would</p><p>be a mad world if there were Buddhist chemistry and Hindu chemistry
and Christian chemistry – people would simply laugh because the laws of
chemistry are the same.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is true about the inner science – which has been known up to
now as religion. The methods of reaching to your innermost center are
scientific; there is no question of any adjective, they are the same. It
is absolutely unnecessary to call them Christian or Hindu.</p><p><br></p><p>The common person has a tremendous power in his hands. If he moves
into small communes, deserts the cities which are dying, which are
nothing but citadels of crime<span class=s4></span>If he moves away,
he</p><p>takes the power of the powerful and the wisdom of the so-called
wise.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is beautiful to have a small commune where everybody knows
everybody else, understands everybody; where everybody is ready to help,
is always available in times when there is need.</p><p>In a city you are absolutely alone. You may be living in the same
building and you may not yet have been introduced; in one building
thousands of people are living. And the city life is so speedy that
there is no time to sit and gossip, to play cards or to play music, or
to have a communal dance. All those beautiful things have disappeared.
In small communes we can revive everything that was of beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been to aboriginal tribes... the whole day they will be
working in their fields or in the mines. But by the evening, after their
meals, they will all gather in the middle of the village with all their
instruments. They will have music and they will have dance – and it will
continue late into the night.</p><p><br></p><p>It was so beautiful to see that they have not become mechanical. They
do the work which is needed for their food; otherwise they enjoy their
time. They will play cards... and in a small place, where maybe fifty
people, a hundred people are living, they will all gather together
gossiping. There is something human in it.</p><p><br></p><p>The city has made the human being inhuman.</p><p><br></p><p>But the revolution that has to come, has to come from the common
people themselves. The powerful people – whether in wisdom or in
political power – are too involved in this system. They cannot change
it; they will go on making it grow. And the common man will be crushed –
he is being crushed.</p><p><br></p><p>Houses have become just boxes – boxes upon boxes. They don’t have the
beauty of a house. They are no longer houses; the space has gone on
shrinking. Small rooms which perhaps are not natural... they are
claustrophobic. And every being, man or animal, has a territorial
imperative – an area of big space around himself where he is totally
free to move.</p><p><br></p><p>Scientists have discovered that the most difficult thing for animals
in zoos is that they lose their territory. If you go to a zoo and see a
lion, you will be simply surprised: he is simply going round and round,
round and round in his cage. What is he doing? He is trying, by
traveling so much, to deceive himself that he has his territory.</p><p><br></p><p>All the animals, lions... and we know about dogs because they are
more common. You may never have thought about why they do it – dogs will
go on pissing on this pole, on that pole, on this stone.… If you watch,
the same dog will do the same thing on the same pole, on the same stone
every day – because animals are very very sensitive in their smell. He
is creating a boundary: “Beware, this area belongs to me!”</p><p><br></p><p>He is creating a fence of smell. You may not smell it, but other dogs
smell it: it is dangerous to enter. And it has been observed that if
another dog comes, he immediately stops at an invisible barrier and
thinks twice, whether to enter or not. And the dog inside looks at him,
but he is not agitated or ferocious or angry because the other dog is
still outside his territory. One step in and he will go mad. He knows
where the territory is, the outside dog knows where the territory
is.</p><p><br></p><p>And in jungles, all animals make their territories the same way, and
most of their territories are respected by other animals. But you put
them in a zoo, in a small cage, and you destroy their freedom. Perhaps
something of their soul is crushed.</p><p>What about man?</p><p><br></p><p>If all animals have a territory, a certain territory, a determinable
territory – if lions have only that much territory, all the lions – then
what about man? It is not possible that he has no territorial
imperative. He also has it. But in the crowds of a city how can he
manage a territory? And if he cannot manage a space around himself,
perhaps he is losing something of his inner being too.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is not strange that when you go out of the city, in the open –
in the forest, near the ocean, or in the mountains – suddenly you feel
an expansion of being. That expansion of being is a very scientific
phenomenon – nothing poetic. It is your territory; there, you can have
it.</p><p><br></p><p>The world is big enough still – people can move. They have moved to
the cities because they are center of money. If they understand only one
thing – that money cannot buy anything of value, and you have lost
everything, running after money.…</p><p><br></p><p>Go back! Go to the world where you belong – to the trees, to the
animals, to the rivers, to the mountains.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IS IT OKAY TO HAVE A SECRET?</p><p><br></p><p>It is a complicated question.</p><p><br></p><p>For a man like me it is not okay to have a secret. There is nothing
to hide. Everything should be made available to people, everything
should be shared. So the awakened person cannot have a secret.</p><p><br></p><p>But the unawakened person is bound to have secrets, for the simple
reason that he is living in a mad world – he has not been able to raise
his consciousness above it. If he opens his secrets to other people,
they may exploit him, they may take advantage of it – they are certainly
going to take advantage of it.</p><p><br></p><p>So for the unawakened it is okay to have secrets; otherwise he will
be creating so many troubles for himself that he may not be able to
manage them.</p><p><br></p><p>Just one thing he has to remember: if he loves someone he should not
have any secrets with the person he loves, because every secret is a
barrier. If you love a person, then there should be nothing in you that
the person is not allowed to know. Between the two of you there should
not be anything private, secretive. That is part, an essential part of
love.</p><p><br></p><p>But that is only between two persons who love each other. In love
they have become almost one – there is no question of keeping a secret.
But to the world at large it is not needed to open your secrets. Nobody
is asking, nobody is bothered; and why should you open your secrets? And
your secrets will give them power over you.</p><p>The Catholic church has a tradition of confession: every Catholic has
to confess to the priest what sins he has committed. This is a very
cunning strategy, because the priest knows all your secrets, all your
sins. You cannot leave the fold, otherwise he can expose you.</p><p><br></p><p>You have given your power into his hands.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few months ago, the pope announced to the Catholics that one
of the greatest sins is to confess to God directly. You have to confess
through the priest, otherwise it is a sin.</p><p><br></p><p>Why should it be a sin if somebody confesses to God directly? But the
pope’s concern is that if people start confessing directly to God, then
who is going to confess to the priest? It is embarrassing. And then the
priest’s power over people will be lost. So you have committed one sin;
you are committing a greater sin if you confess to God directly. A
mediator, a priest is an absolute necessity.</p><p><br></p><p>In politics it is an everyday affair. In India, the first prime
minister remained in power long enough to know everybody’s weaknesses,
everybody’s crimes; and he had maintained a file. That file was power:
You cannot betray him, you cannot go against him; otherwise you will be
in very great difficulty. He knows some secret that he can expose about
you.</p><p><br></p><p>When he died, the file went into the hands of his daughter. That was
her power; otherwise she had no power. She was not a politician; but
even without being a politician she maintained a tremendous power – more
than her father. And the file went on growing bigger and bigger.</p><p><br></p><p>About every politician in India they had every secret. Whatever they
had been forgiven for had been reported; it could be exposed any moment,
and the man would be finished. They may have been chief ministers, they
may have been governors, they may have been cabinet ministers – but they
were all puppets because of the file.</p><p><br></p><p>And you will be surprised that when Sanjay Gandhi, Indira’s son, died
in an accident just close to their house in an airplane, everybody
rushed there. As Indira was informed, she rushed there. The most amazing
thing is that she was not concerned about what had happened, how he
died. What she was concerned about was: “Where are those two keys he was
carrying?”</p><p><br></p><p>The son has died – can you think of a mother asking about two keys
that he was carrying? And first she got hold of those two keys; only
then she did make other enquiries.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been told, those two keys were the keys to all the secret
files against the politicians of India – because that was her power. If
those two keys are lost then it will be a difficult job – first those
two keys<span class=s4></span>Perhaps one key was concerned with the
files and the other key was concerned with</p><p>the money they were keeping in hiding. And this was a constant fight
between Sanjay and Indira: he wanted those two keys.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t know exactly, but people who knew their house and their inner
workings say that he even slapped his mother once because she was
adamant and would not give him those two keys. And finally she had to
give them to him because he was creating too much trouble for her. Just
to console him, she gave him those two keys.</p><p>And I don’t see that she was very much hurt by his death. Perhaps
deep down she wanted it. He was not the man she wanted to replace her;
her elder son was the person that she wanted to take her place. But
whoever had all those secrets would be the prime minister. This is how,
for forty years, one family has been ruling the whole country in the
name of democracy – but it is really a dynasty. And if they go on
keeping those secrets they may be able to continue.</p><p><br></p><p>So I will not say that you have to tell your secrets to everyone. In
the first place, what is the need? But yes, if you love a person then
don’t keep any secrets. It makes you closer, more intimate.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you become awakened, enlightened, then of course you are
available to all, with no secrets. You should be an absolutely open
book. Anybody can read it – because now you exist for others, your own
existence is fulfilled. And nobody can exploit you, nobody can take
advantage of you in any way.</p><p><br></p><p>The enlightened person is in a position to open himself totally, but
nobody else is in that position.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part22>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

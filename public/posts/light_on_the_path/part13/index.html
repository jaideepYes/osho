JUST LIVING TOGETHER, RUNNING BUSINESSES, DOESN’T SEEM TO BE ENOUGH, IT IS NOT SATISFYING. IT FEELS LIKE SOMETHING DEEPER – SOMETHING MORE CHALLENGING FOR THE COLLECTIVE AND THE INDIVIDUAL, IN WHICH BOTH GROW – IS NEEDED.\nA buddhafield is one of the most mysterious phenomena in existence. It simply means whenever someone becomes awakened, his consciousness radiates a certain aura around him. Whoever is receptive, available, can be transformed by the radiating energy from an awakened being. The very presence of the awakened person can hit you so deep that your dormant energy starts awakening.\nIt has been described as a sleeping serpent being awakened. It was lying coiled, looking almost dead, and when provoked, it uncoils itself. Because of the similarity of the phenomena, in the East the uncoiling energy in the presence of the awakened person is called Kundalini. Kundalini simply means the serpent power.\nThe buddhafield can become a network. In the hands of a skilled master it need not be confined to a small area; hence I have introduced the communes. It is as if you put a mirror in front of a light. The mirror has no way of producing light, but it can reflect light. A single light surrounded by thousands of mirrors can create a light of immense quantity.\nIn India there is a temple made completely of small pieces of mirror. When you enter the temple you are suddenly surrounded by yourself from every side, in thousands of ways: from the ceiling, from the floor, from the walls. Each piece represents you in your totality. It is not that the piece of mirror is going to reflect only a certain part of you; it reflects you totally, your whole personality. And those thousands of mirrors all reflect you.\nJust take a burning candle inside with you and you will be surprised at the effect: just one candle suddenly becomes thousands of candles, and all the reflections create tremendous light.\nThe man who had made the temple was one of the richest men in India. He simply loved to make unique things. He loved me very much. I asked him – he had taken me to the temple to show me – I asked him, “Do you know the meaning of this temple?”\nHe said, “Meaning? I have simply created a unique piece of beauty, architecture, and something which has no parallel in the whole world.”\nI said, “That’s true, but there is meaning also in it, and you must know it, because it is very embarrassing that you created the temple and you don’t know the meaning of it. The meaning is, this temple represents in a material way the fabric of a buddhafield.”\nOne buddha can create thousands of seekers around him. They are not awakened but they are willing to be awakened. They have not yet reached the goal, but they are very receptive, open, available. In the presence of the master they can at least function as mirrors very easily; then one buddha becomes millions of buddhas.\nI had made the communes so that five thousand people could live together and learn to reflect me. Not to imitate me, remember – these are two totally different things. The mirror never imitates you; the mirror simply reflects you.\nNow I have dissolved the communes, because now I want the whole world to be my commune.\nWherever there is a sannyasin, he has to be a mirror. And time and space make no difference: If he is available to me, he is as close to me as you are. And from the farthest corner of the earth he can reflect me.\nAnd now I have millions of sannyasins around the world. I have withdrawn all conditions that can hinder people from becoming sannyasins. These millions of people are going to create a network of energy enveloping the whole earth.\nJust one sun rises in the morning, but it is being reflected by all the oceans, all the lakes, all the rivers, all the ponds. Small ponds reflect the same sun as the biggest ocean. Just one sun rises, and millions of places start reflecting it. And it is not only the ocean, lake, river, ponds – there are other reflections too, which are more subtle.\nEven before the sun comes above the horizon, the birds suddenly start singing. They are awakened, something has happened to them, and something tremendously beautiful; otherwise from where will the song arise? And they are so full of life! The flowers open their petals... these are also reflections.\nThere is no obligation on their part; they can remain buds. There is no obligation on the part of the birds; they may decide not to sing, but something irresistible which is beyond their control.…\nWhen the sun is rising, something is rising in them too: their life energy, their kundalini. Of course a bird cannot become a buddha, but he can at least sing, dance, fly in the sky just out of sheer joy, open his wings as an indication of freedom, aliveness. He can claim the whole sky as his own.\nAnd all the flowers – from the smallest grass flower to the biggest lotus – they suddenly all fall into a symphony. They forget their differences; they forget that there are poor flowers and there are rich flowers, that there is the proletariat and there are the bourgeois; suddenly all classes disappear. And in their flowering, in their opening, they release whatsoever they have.\nThey give back to existence as a gift whatever existence has given to them. They don’t keep it, they don’t hoard it. They give it back a thousandfold, they multiply it, because what was – apparently – not in the seed, what was not in the roots, what was not in the tree, in the branches, in the leaves... has suddenly come to blossom in the flower: all the colors, all the fragrance. But they waited long in the dark night for the sun to rise.\nThe presence of the sun suddenly gets reflected in millions of ways and creates a network of light, life, joy, fullness, overflowing ecstasy. That’s what I mean by a buddhafield.\nOne man getting awakened means the sun has risen. It is the declaration that the dark night of the soul is at an end.\nBut it is possible only if there are millions of people spread all over the earth to create a connectedness. With this net of energy we may be able to transform many people who had no idea, who had never dreamed that there is something more than a mundane life.\nSo you are right – just working together, creating a commune, creating finances to run it, is not enough. It has nothing to do with the buddhafield. Seeing the fact that in communes you will get entangled in so many unnecessary things, that there is a possibility to forget for what you had gathered there in the first placeNow I don’t want big communes but small groups, more intimate,\nor individuals doing their ordinary work in the world. That takes only five hours, five days a week, and leaves you immense time and energy to become part of a great, ecstatic experience.\nIn the commune I found it is difficult, because you are trying to create an alternative society – which takes too much time, too much energy. People were working for twelve hours, fourteen hours, and had no energy left. Even if the sun rises, the bird has no energy to sing. The sun rises, but the rose has no energy to open its petals and release the fragrance.\nAnd because you are creating an alternative society, the ordinary world is going to be antagonistic to you. You are strangers and you are trying something which their tradition and their experience prohibits. And they are in the majority; they have governments in their hands, they have the law in their hands. So creating takes your time and energy; and then fighting with the society – which is too big for you – that also takes your energy.\nI was thinking that humanity had progressed since the days of Socrates, but I was wrong. It is still where it was, it has not progressed at all. Civilization has not yet happened, culture is still a dream, and democracy a faraway utopia.\nSo whenever you come in conflict you will see the barbarous, the primitive, the animalistic, coming up to destroy you. And naturally you cannot survive against the vast masses, the blind people.\nI am reminded of a story – not a story but a real fact; it is so strange that it looks like a story. In South America in a hidden valley deep in the mountains, it was found that there lived a small community of people, not more than three hundred – all blind. It was strange – what had happened to these people? What calamity had fallen on them?\nOne man, very adventurous, a scientific enquirer, wanted to know what had happened to these people... because people were afraid to go into the valley, it was dangerous. If three hundred people are blind, perhaps there is something wrong in the air, something wrong in the water, something wrong in the food – who knows what is wrong? You may go blind!\nBut this courageous young man entered the commune and was surprised... he did not become blind. He figured out what was happening: there was a certain fly in the mountainsEvery child\nwas born with eyes, as every child is born everywhere else, but within three, four months – if the fly bites the child – he will go blind. Three or four months was too great a time, and the fly was a common fly, all around, everywhere.\nSo everybody was born with eyes, but nobody ever remembered that once he had eyes because he had lost them so early in life – when he was two months old, at the most four months old. But that fly’s bite was not capable of destroying a young man’s eyes. So anybody who had passed at least one year was beyond the reach of the fly; it needed only the very vulnerable child.\nThe man wanted to help them because he had found the cause; the cause could be destroyed and those common children could be saved. While he was working on the plans of how to destroy the fly, the whole commune of those primitive people used to laugh at the madman. They used to laugh because they could not believe that he had eyes and they didn’t. And of course they were three hundred and he was alone and there was no way to prove that he had eyes. Those three hundred people had never heard about eyes – he was just a poet, a dreamer!\nBut living with them he fell in love with a girl of the community. He wanted to marry that girl, but the community had a condition: “You will have to drop this illusion that you have eyes. And to make certain, we have our elders who will check you. If they find something that you call eyes, they will destroy them.because you have something which you should not have. No human being has eyes\n– something is wrong with you.\n“You can marry the girl of our community, but the condition is that you have to become part of our community. You have to become blind. You can choose. Either you have to leave – leave us alone and don’t disturb us. Since you have come it has been a continuous disturbance. You have been corrupting our youth, putting in their minds the idea of eyes – which we have never heard of from our elders, our forefathers. We have always lived this way. And we don’t need eyes. What will we do with eyes? – we are perfectly happy and content.\n“You have disturbed our peace and now you want to get entry into our community. You will have to choose: you will have to lose your so-called eyes if you want to get married, or you forget all about this love affair and leave this valley and never come back again.”\nThe young man thought for the whole night. He really loved the woman, but this was stupid, the condition was simply idiotic, that he had to lose his eyes. In fact he loved the woman because of his eyes. She was so beautiful, and all those three hundred people were not aware of her beauty and they would never be aware of her beauty. It was his eyes that had given the glimpse of the beauty of the woman.\nHe had seen so many women, but he settled for a blind woman. Although she was blind, she had something indescribable, something otherworldly. But to lose one’s eyes to get that woman seems to be a very strange bargain, because in losing your eyes you will be also losing that woman; you will never be able to see her again. Then all women are equal. To a blind man what difference does it make that you have a homely woman or a Cleopatra? It doesn’t matter.\nNo, he could not manage to convince himself to lose his eyes, because his eyes were the source of the experience of the beauty. In the middle of the night he escaped from the valley.\nAnd this is not a story, it is a historical fact.\nSo when we created communes, I was thinking humanity has progressed, has come a long way from the days of Socrates and Buddha. But I was wrong. They have not moved a single inch! They have changed their masks, they wear better masks than their ancestors, but behind the mask is hidden a barbarous soul – uncivilized, uncultured.\nIt is not able to accept the stranger. It is not vast enough to absorb the new, the unknown, the unexperienced. It becomes irritated, it becomes annoyed. It wants to destroy your eyes, because it is blind and your eyes will remind it about its blindness.\nSeeing the situation, I have dissolved the communes. I would rather rely on individuals. In that way I can spread my message far and wide. I have even allowed you, if you feel it difficult, not to use the red color, not to use the mala, so no blind man is annoyed by youBecause I want to protect your\neyes – and they are very vulnerable because you are in the situation of a child and just a fly can destroy your eyes. And these people are not flies, they are monsters.\nThe buddhafield has expanded its area, but its strategy has changed. Now I will depend on the individuals – and individuals can move around the world, to faraway corners; still there will be a connecting link with me. Wherever there is a sannyasins of mine, I am there. He will be my mirror, he will reflect me and my light. He will transmit my energy, my understanding.\nSo you are right: just being together and working hard and running a disco and making money and doing all kinds of things does not seem enough. It is not enough. It is not only not enough, it is a sheer wastage.\nSo you work in the world; and it is a simple thing – whenever you feel a deep urge to be with me, I will be available. You can always come to me.\nTo make it a reality, now we will not be having any celebrations; now the celebration will continue all the year round – three hundred and sixty-five days of celebration! And I will be living somewhere, soon – my people are searching for the right place for me to be. And all the year round you can\ncome to me, whenever you have time. So there will be always three to five hundred people coming and going. And I would like a more intimate contact with you because now I am going to depend on the individual.\nYou cannot understand how painful it has been for me that people longing for years to come, would come to the commune but then there would be twenty thousand people and they would not be able even to see me while I am speaking. I will not be able to see their faces, I will not be able to look into their eyes – and they have come from far away. Waiting for years, earning money, somehow they have managed to come. But with twenty thousand people gathering I cannot manage individual intimacy.\nSo my new format of work is going to be an all-year-round festival. So you are welcome any moment, because the festival will be continuous, so we don’t collect twenty thousand or fifty thousand people at one time. We distribute people all over the year, so I can sit with you on the lawn, I can sit with you under the trees, I can sit with you under the stars, and I can talk to you or I can be silent with you. So when you go back you are full of me.\nAnd this is going to be the new order of the buddhafield. Question 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nMEDITATION IS THE KEY. WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO LIVE A MEDITATIVE LIFE WITHOUT YOUR PHYSICAL PRESENCE?\nIt is difficult because you have not yet been able to find your own source of meditation.\nBeing in my presence you need not meditate. Just being in my presence, a silence descends on you. Your heart has a different rhythm, your being feels a tremendous contentment.\nBut this is just a reflection. You should not be deceived by the reflection. Enjoy the reflection, let it penetrate as deeply in you as possible. But this is only an example, that if it can happen in my presence, why cannot it happen in my absence? – because it is happening in you. I may be functioning as a catalytic agent, but the source is within you; you just have to start trying it.\nFor example, you are in my presence and you feel meditation comes so easily; in fact you need not think about it, it is there. Just try sitting in your room. If it helps, remember me, visualize me, that I am sitting in front of you, and allow the same experience to happen again. You will be surprised; you don’t know how capable your consciousness is. Just think: you had enjoyed a certain perfume.…\nSufi mystics have even used it as part of their strategy; you will enjoy this certain perfume. Perhaps twenty years have passed: you can sit silently remembering it, bringing that experience of the perfume closer to you, bypassing the twenty years. And you will be surprised that suddenly the perfume is there. You can still smell it; twenty years have not been able to destroy it. It has remained somewhere deep in your consciousness, you can never forget it.\nSufi mystics have used it, although no Sufi has ever said so. Why? When you go to a Sufi master the first thing offered to you is perfume, and each Sufi master has his own perfume. He associates himself with that perfume because he knows the functioning of the consciousness: that a perfume cannot be forgotten. And whenever you remember the perfume you will have to remember the master; they become associated.\nAnd every day it happens: you come to the master and the first thing is that he offers you the perfume. His place is full of the same perfume. The moment you enter you are engulfed in the perfume. Month by month, year by year, you live with the master. The perfume goes on penetrating into the deepest layers of your consciousness – and with the perfume, the master is also entering you.\nWhenever you will be far away the instructions are: remember the perfume. And you will be surprised that whenever you remember the perfume, suddenly the presence of the master is there. And all that has been happening in the presence of the master starts happening in his absence. The source is within you.\nThese are just strategies. I have not been using anything like that, for the simple reason that I trust more in your love than in any association with something mundane.\nIf you love me, you can materialize me anywhere you want.\nAnd no perfume is higher than the perfume of love. No music is more musical than the music of love.\nI have not used anything. In a few schools of mystics, music is used – the same tune, so that whenever you hear the tune or remember the tune, you will be transported from your actual surroundings into those surroundings that you always wanted to be in.\nBut these are very mundane strategies. I would like to be more straightforward. I would not like anything to stand between me and you – even to remind you. I want immediate contact. I want, categorically, immediacy, no mediator, because nothing works more miraculously than love.\nAll those old masters had to use other things because about love, they were afraid. Their own fear of love made them choose third-rate things to help you. I am not afraid of anything – particularly of love.\nSo in my presence remember: meditation is easy because in my presence love is easy. So wherever you are, be loving.\nBe loving to the people you are with, be loving to the sky you see. Be loving to the trees you move by.\nJust be loving – and whenever you are thrilled with love you will find I am walking by your side, sitting by your side, that my hand is in your hand – who says that I am far away? And you will immediately have the proof because mediation will be coming from all sides running, flooding you.\nAnd once you have found it, that it can happen anywhere, then the last dependence has ended. Then my presence is no longer a need for you. That does not mean that you don’t love me anymore; in fact, just the contrary. How can you love totally when there is some kind of dependence? You can love totally only when there is no dependence.\nOne of Buddha’s intimate disciples, Sariputta, became enlightened in Buddha’s lifetime. But he would not say it to Buddha, he was trying hard to hide it. He was doing things which only an unenlightened person can do.\nFinally Buddha had to call him, and say, “Sariputta, you can’t deceive me. You stop all this nonsense of doing things, saying things just to hide the fact that you have become enlightened. Why are you so afraid? Why don’t you simply say what has happened?”\nSariputta said, “I am truly afraid. I was postponing this enlightenment as much as possible because I knew when I became enlightened you would say, ‘Sariputta, now you go, reach the people, help the people. Now you don’t need me, so why do you go on hanging around?’ I did everything to avoid it but what was to happen, has happened, and now you have found out – please don’t send me away.”\nBuddha said, “But you don’t need me anymore. Your excuse to be with me for so many years was that without me you cannot become enlightened; now you have become enlightened, your excuse is no longer valid.”\nSariputta’s statement is very significant. He said, “Yes, my excuse is no longer valid, and I don’t need you. But I am going to stay with you because it is you and your love that has made me so independent – even independent of my own master. Just to show my gratitude, just to touch your feet every dayI refuse to go anywhere else.\n“I was with you up to now with a need; now I am going to be with you without any need. For the first time my love is simply pure – no motivation, no desirejust pure gratitude.”\nWhen the need disappears, the gratitude arises. When dependence disappears, a tremendous feeling, that what you were and what you have becomethe distance is so vast that unless the\npresence of the master was a miracle, it is not explainable.\nSo whenever you feel that it is difficult to meditate without me, remember my love for you, remember your love for me.\nLove immediately destroys distances.\nAnd you will find me as much present as I am here – or even more. And once you have found it, then there is no problem: wherever you are, meditation is your own, it is your own energy. Still you can go on coming.\nI am not so hard as Gautam Buddha. You must have seen Gautam Buddha’s marble statues. He was just like that – cold as a marble statue, even when he was alive. A beautiful man, an immensely miraculous man, but he was very cold.\nI am a totally different person. My compassion is not of somebody who is higher than you; my compassion is very human, because I understand the days of the dark nights. I have been through those dark nights – I know how you must be suffering in those dark nights. But it is all up to you: you can prolong the dark night, or you can end it and bring the sunrise immediately into your life.\nI have called you my friend. Remember that word.\nI promise you to be with you whenever you need me. Just need me! Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nTHE GERMAN MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS DOESN’T ALLOW YOU TO ENTER GERMANY. DO YOU WANT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT?\nIt seems that no government will allow me in any country. It is a good sign. It means they have started recognizing me.\nI cannot be recognized by winning a Nobel Prize. I can be recognized only by the way America has treated me, India is treating me, Germany is treating me. But I am surprised about Germany. I have never been to Germany; naturally I cannot commit any crime in Germany under German law. It must be something unprecedented, that a person who has never been to your country, has not done any harm to your country – you have to decide beforehand, in case he comes, that he should not be allowed to enter.\nIt shows a great recognition of a single individual who has no powers – governments are so afraid. They must be wrong, there must be something that they are afraid of which my presence can expose.\nI say it is a good sign – I love it. I will refuse a Nobel Prize because that is bourgeois but I cannot refuse such a beautiful recognition; that simply fits with me.\nOne thing I would like to tell you is that Germany can prevent me from entering the country but it cannot prevent me from entering the heart of the German people, particularly German youth. And of course they cannot prevent me from allowing the German youth to enter into my heart.\nAnd my work is invisible – I need not go to Germany. But those who love me can come to me wherever I am. And if their love is strong enough then they can find me amongst them. I need not enter the country; still I can be with my sannyasins.\nMy presence depends on their love, not on the visa that the government issues.\nBut it simply shows the poverty of your so-called great powers. You should be happy and rejoice the day I cannot find any place to stay anywhere in the world. You have to dance and sing and rejoice that this is happening for the first time.…\nBecause Socrates was condemned in Athens, and Athens was only a city state. The judges had told him, “You can leave Athens and there will be no punishment for you. And there is the whole world – why should you unnecessarily get poisoned? Just leave Athens.”\nJesus was crucified in Judea – a very small place. Nobody had heard about him while he was alive. And he did not die on the cross either. Not that there was any resurrection; he was simply brought down from the cross within six hours – and on the Jewish cross it needs twenty-four hours, sometimes forty-eight hours, for a person to die.\nIt was a negotiation between Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, and one of the influential men who wanted Jesus to be saved. So this was the agreement: on Friday Jesus should be crucified – but as late as possible so he is not too long on the cross. Jews stop all work as the sun sets on Friday, and Saturday is the day of sabbath; they don’t do anything. So it was delayed as long as possible; only in the afternoon when the sun was going down was Jesus crucified. And before the sun set he had to be brought down because of the Jewish tradition.\nNow he had to wait in the cave. He would have to be crucified again after the sabbath ends – and that was the time when he was stolen. He was taken out of Judea. He lived in India up to one hundred and twelve years – a very ripe age. He died in India – I have been to his grave in Kashmir, and a strange coincidence: Kashmir has the graves of Jesus and Moses too.\nBut nowhere was he hindered, nowhere was he persecuted, nowhere was he crucified again. In India he lived a long life. He was thirty-three when he was crucified in Judea, and he lived up to one hundred and twelve years without any persecution.\nSo this is something to rejoice about, that I may be the first man in the whole of history who is being persecuted around the world. But this is not bad news, it is good news. It means I have threatened all the powers of the world – religious, political, social. A single man, single-handedly has been able to prove the impotency and poverty of all great powers, great theologians, great organized religions. What more reward can I receive?\nAnd this is going to help the movement. It means you have got a master, not just a goody-goody saint!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5144","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/light_on_the_path/part13/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/light_on_the_path/>Light on the Path</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">13 Whenever there is a sannyasin of mine, I am there</h1><div class=post-meta>25 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5144 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Light_on_the_Path/part13.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

JUST LIVING TOGETHER, RUNNING BUSINESSES,
DOESN’T SEEM TO BE ENOUGH, IT IS NOT SATISFYING. IT FEELS LIKE SOMETHING
DEEPER – SOMETHING MORE CHALLENGING FOR THE COLLECTIVE AND THE
INDIVIDUAL, IN WHICH BOTH GROW – IS NEEDED.</p><p><br></p><p>A buddhafield is one of the most mysterious phenomena in existence.
It simply means whenever someone becomes awakened, his consciousness
radiates a certain aura around him. Whoever is receptive, available, can
be transformed by the radiating energy from an awakened being. The very
presence of the awakened person can hit you so deep that your dormant
energy starts awakening.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been described as a sleeping serpent being awakened. It was
lying coiled, looking almost dead, and when provoked, it uncoils itself.
Because of the similarity of the phenomena, in the East the uncoiling
energy in the presence of the awakened person is called Kundalini.
Kundalini simply means the serpent power.</p><p><br></p><p>The buddhafield can become a network. In the hands of a skilled
master it need not be confined to a small area; hence I have introduced
the communes. It is as if you put a mirror in front of a light. The
mirror has no way of producing light, but it can reflect light. A single
light surrounded by thousands of mirrors can create a light of immense
quantity.</p><p>In India there is a temple made completely of small pieces of mirror.
When you enter the temple you are suddenly surrounded by yourself from
every side, in thousands of ways: from the ceiling, from the floor, from
the walls. Each piece represents you in your totality. It is not that
the piece of mirror is going to reflect only a certain part of you; it
reflects you totally, your whole personality. And those thousands of
mirrors all reflect you.</p><p><br></p><p>Just take a burning candle inside with you and you will be surprised
at the effect: just one candle suddenly becomes thousands of candles,
and all the reflections create tremendous light.</p><p><br></p><p>The man who had made the temple was one of the richest men in India.
He simply loved to make unique things. He loved me very much. I asked
him – he had taken me to the temple to show me – I asked him, “Do you
know the meaning of this temple?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Meaning? I have simply created a unique piece of beauty,
architecture, and something which has no parallel in the whole
world.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That’s true, but there is meaning also in it, and you must
know it, because it is very embarrassing that you created the temple and
you don’t know the meaning of it. The meaning is, this temple represents
in a material way the fabric of a buddhafield.”</p><p><br></p><p>One buddha can create thousands of seekers around him. They are not
awakened but they are willing to be awakened. They have not yet reached
the goal, but they are very receptive, open, available. In the presence
of the master they can at least function as mirrors very easily; then
one buddha becomes millions of buddhas.</p><p><br></p><p>I had made the communes so that five thousand people could live
together and learn to reflect me. Not to imitate me, remember – these
are two totally different things. The mirror never imitates you; the
mirror simply reflects you.</p><p><br></p><p>Now I have dissolved the communes, because now I want the whole world
to be my commune.</p><p><br></p><p>Wherever there is a sannyasin, he has to be a mirror. And time and
space make no difference: If he is available to me, he is as close to me
as you are. And from the farthest corner of the earth he can reflect
me.</p><p><br></p><p>And now I have millions of sannyasins around the world. I have
withdrawn all conditions that can hinder people from becoming
sannyasins. These millions of people are going to create a network of
energy enveloping the whole earth.</p><p><br></p><p>Just one sun rises in the morning, but it is being reflected by all
the oceans, all the lakes, all the rivers, all the ponds. Small ponds
reflect the same sun as the biggest ocean. Just one sun rises, and
millions of places start reflecting it. And it is not only the ocean,
lake, river, ponds – there are other reflections too, which are more
subtle.</p><p><br></p><p>Even before the sun comes above the horizon, the birds suddenly start
singing. They are awakened, something has happened to them, and
something tremendously beautiful; otherwise from where will the song
arise? And they are so full of life! The flowers open their petals...
these are also reflections.</p><p>There is no obligation on their part; they can remain buds. There is
no obligation on the part of the birds; they may decide not to sing, but
something irresistible which is beyond their control.…</p><p>When the sun is rising, something is rising in them too: their life
energy, their kundalini. Of course a bird cannot become a buddha, but he
can at least sing, dance, fly in the sky just out of sheer joy, open his
wings as an indication of freedom, aliveness. He can claim the whole sky
as his own.</p><p>And all the flowers – from the smallest grass flower to the biggest
lotus – they suddenly all fall into a symphony. They forget their
differences; they forget that there are poor flowers and there are rich
flowers, that there is the proletariat and there are the bourgeois;
suddenly all classes disappear. And in their flowering, in their
opening, they release whatsoever they have.</p><p>They give back to existence as a gift whatever existence has given to
them. They don’t keep it, they don’t hoard it. They give it back a
thousandfold, they multiply it, because what was – apparently – not in
the seed, what was not in the roots, what was not in the tree, in the
branches, in the leaves... has suddenly come to blossom in the flower:
all the colors, all the fragrance. But they waited long in the dark
night for the sun to rise.</p><p>The presence of the sun suddenly gets reflected in millions of ways
and creates a network of light, life, joy, fullness, overflowing
ecstasy. That’s what I mean by a buddhafield.</p><p>One man getting awakened means the sun has risen. It is the
declaration that the dark night of the soul is at an end.</p><p>But it is possible only if there are millions of people spread all
over the earth to create a connectedness. With this net of energy we may
be able to transform many people who had no idea, who had never dreamed
that there is something more than a mundane life.</p><p>So you are right – just working together, creating a commune,
creating finances to run it, is not enough. It has nothing to do with
the buddhafield. Seeing the fact that in communes you will get entangled
in so many unnecessary things, that there is a possibility to forget for
what you had gathered there in the first place<span class=s4></span>Now I don’t want big communes but small groups, more
intimate,</p><p>or individuals doing their ordinary work in the world. That takes
only five hours, five days a week, and leaves you immense time and
energy to become part of a great, ecstatic experience.</p><p>In the commune I found it is difficult, because you are trying to
create an alternative society – which takes too much time, too much
energy. People were working for twelve hours, fourteen hours, and had no
energy left. Even if the sun rises, the bird has no energy to sing. The
sun rises, but the rose has no energy to open its petals and release the
fragrance.</p><p>And because you are creating an alternative society, the ordinary
world is going to be antagonistic to you. You are strangers and you are
trying something which their tradition and their experience prohibits.
And they are in the majority; they have governments in their hands, they
have the law in their hands. So creating takes your time and energy; and
then fighting with the society – which is too big for you – that also
takes your energy.</p><p>I was thinking that humanity had progressed since the days of
Socrates, but I was wrong. It is still where it was, it has not
progressed at all. Civilization has not yet happened, culture is still a
dream, and democracy a faraway utopia.</p><p>So whenever you come in conflict you will see the barbarous, the
primitive, the animalistic, coming up to destroy you. And naturally you
cannot survive against the vast masses, the blind people.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of a story – not a story but a real fact; it is so
strange that it looks like a story. In South America in a hidden valley
deep in the mountains, it was found that there lived a small community
of people, not more than three hundred – all blind. It was strange –
what had happened to these people? What calamity had fallen on them?</p><p><br></p><p>One man, very adventurous, a scientific enquirer, wanted to know what
had happened to these people... because people were afraid to go into
the valley, it was dangerous. If three hundred people are blind, perhaps
there is something wrong in the air, something wrong in the water,
something wrong in the food – who knows what is wrong? You may go
blind!</p><p><br></p><p>But this courageous young man entered the commune and was
surprised... he did not become blind. He figured out what was happening:
there was a certain fly in the mountains<span class=s4></span>Every
child</p><p>was born with eyes, as every child is born everywhere else, but
within three, four months – if the fly bites the child – he will go
blind. Three or four months was too great a time, and the fly was a
common fly, all around, everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>So everybody was born with eyes, but nobody ever remembered that once
he had eyes because he had lost them so early in life – when he was two
months old, at the most four months old. But that fly’s bite was not
capable of destroying a young man’s eyes. So anybody who had passed at
least one year was beyond the reach of the fly; it needed only the very
vulnerable child.</p><p><br></p><p>The man wanted to help them because he had found the cause; the cause
could be destroyed and those common children could be saved. While he
was working on the plans of how to destroy the fly, the whole commune of
those primitive people used to laugh at the madman. They used to laugh
because they could not believe that he had eyes and they didn’t. And of
course they were three hundred and he was alone and there was no way to
prove that he had eyes. Those three hundred people had never heard about
eyes – he was just a poet, a dreamer!</p><p><br></p><p>But living with them he fell in love with a girl of the community. He
wanted to marry that girl, but the community had a condition: “You will
have to drop this illusion that you have eyes. And to make certain, we
have our elders who will check you. If they find something that you call
eyes, they will destroy them.<span class=s4></span>because you have
something which you should not have. No human being has eyes</p><p>– something is wrong with you.</p><p><br></p><p>“You can marry the girl of our community, but the condition is that
you have to become part of our community. You have to become blind. You
can choose. Either you have to leave – leave us alone and don’t disturb
us. Since you have come it has been a continuous disturbance. You have
been corrupting our youth, putting in their minds the idea of eyes –
which we have never heard of from our elders, our forefathers. We have
always lived this way. And we don’t need eyes. What will we do with
eyes? – we are perfectly happy and content.</p><p><br></p><p>“You have disturbed our peace and now you want to get entry into our
community. You will have to choose: you will have to lose your so-called
eyes if you want to get married, or you forget all about this love
affair and leave this valley and never come back again.”</p><p>The young man thought for the whole night. He really loved the woman,
but this was stupid, the condition was simply idiotic, that he had to
lose his eyes. In fact he loved the woman because of his eyes. She was
so beautiful, and all those three hundred people were not aware of her
beauty and they would never be aware of her beauty. It was his eyes that
had given the glimpse of the beauty of the woman.</p><p><br></p><p>He had seen so many women, but he settled for a blind woman. Although
she was blind, she had something indescribable, something otherworldly.
But to lose one’s eyes to get that woman seems to be a very strange
bargain, because in losing your eyes you will be also losing that woman;
you will never be able to see her again. Then all women are equal. To a
blind man what difference does it make that you have a homely woman or a
Cleopatra? It doesn’t matter.</p><p><br></p><p>No, he could not manage to convince himself to lose his eyes, because
his eyes were the source of the experience of the beauty. In the middle
of the night he escaped from the valley.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is not a story, it is a historical fact.</p><p><br></p><p>So when we created communes, I was thinking humanity has progressed,
has come a long way from the days of Socrates and Buddha. But I was
wrong. They have not moved a single inch! They have changed their masks,
they wear better masks than their ancestors, but behind the mask is
hidden a barbarous soul – uncivilized, uncultured.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not able to accept the stranger. It is not vast enough to
absorb the new, the unknown, the unexperienced. It becomes irritated, it
becomes annoyed. It wants to destroy your eyes, because it is blind and
your eyes will remind it about its blindness.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing the situation, I have dissolved the communes. I would rather
rely on individuals. In that way I can spread my message far and wide. I
have even allowed you, if you feel it difficult, not to use the red
color, not to use the mala, so no blind man is annoyed by you<span class=s4></span>Because I want to protect your</p><p>eyes – and they are very vulnerable because you are in the situation
of a child and just a fly can destroy your eyes. And these people are
not flies, they are monsters.</p><p><br></p><p>The buddhafield has expanded its area, but its strategy has changed.
Now I will depend on the individuals – and individuals can move around
the world, to faraway corners; still there will be a connecting link
with me. Wherever there is a sannyasins of mine, I am there. He will be
my mirror, he will reflect me and my light. He will transmit my energy,
my understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>So you are right: just being together and working hard and running a
disco and making money and doing all kinds of things does not seem
enough. It is not enough. It is not only not enough, it is a sheer
wastage.</p><p><br></p><p>So you work in the world; and it is a simple thing – whenever you
feel a deep urge to be with me, I will be available. You can always come
to me.</p><p><br></p><p>To make it a reality, now we will not be having any celebrations; now
the celebration will continue all the year round – three hundred and
sixty-five days of celebration! And I will be living somewhere, soon –
my people are searching for the right place for me to be. And all the
year round you can</p><p>come to me, whenever you have time. So there will be always three to
five hundred people coming and going. And I would like a more intimate
contact with you because now I am going to depend on the individual.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot understand how painful it has been for me that people
longing for years to come, would come to the commune but then there
would be twenty thousand people and they would not be able even to see
me while I am speaking. I will not be able to see their faces, I will
not be able to look into their eyes – and they have come from far away.
Waiting for years, earning money, somehow they have managed to come. But
with twenty thousand people gathering I cannot manage individual
intimacy.</p><p><br></p><p>So my new format of work is going to be an all-year-round festival.
So you are welcome any moment, because the festival will be continuous,
so we don’t collect twenty thousand or fifty thousand people at one
time. We distribute people all over the year, so I can sit with you on
the lawn, I can sit with you under the trees, I can sit with you under
the stars, and I can talk to you or I can be silent with you. So when
you go back you are full of me.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is going to be the new order of the buddhafield. Question
2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>MEDITATION IS THE KEY. WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO LIVE A MEDITATIVE
LIFE WITHOUT YOUR PHYSICAL PRESENCE?</p><p><br></p><p>It is difficult because you have not yet been able to find your own
source of meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Being in my presence you need not meditate. Just being in my
presence, a silence descends on you. Your heart has a different rhythm,
your being feels a tremendous contentment.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is just a reflection. You should not be deceived by the
reflection. Enjoy the reflection, let it penetrate as deeply in you as
possible. But this is only an example, that if it can happen in my
presence, why cannot it happen in my absence? – because it is happening
in you. I may be functioning as a catalytic agent, but the source is
within you; you just have to start trying it.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, you are in my presence and you feel meditation comes so
easily; in fact you need not think about it, it is there. Just try
sitting in your room. If it helps, remember me, visualize me, that I am
sitting in front of you, and allow the same experience to happen again.
You will be surprised; you don’t know how capable your consciousness is.
Just think: you had enjoyed a certain perfume.…</p><p><br></p><p>Sufi mystics have even used it as part of their strategy; you will
enjoy this certain perfume. Perhaps twenty years have passed: you can
sit silently remembering it, bringing that experience of the perfume
closer to you, bypassing the twenty years. And you will be surprised
that suddenly the perfume is there. You can still smell it; twenty years
have not been able to destroy it. It has remained somewhere deep in your
consciousness, you can never forget it.</p><p>Sufi mystics have used it, although no Sufi has ever said so. Why?
When you go to a Sufi master the first thing offered to you is perfume,
and each Sufi master has his own perfume. He associates himself with
that perfume because he knows the functioning of the consciousness: that
a perfume cannot be forgotten. And whenever you remember the perfume you
will have to remember the master; they become associated.</p><p><br></p><p>And every day it happens: you come to the master and the first thing
is that he offers you the perfume. His place is full of the same
perfume. The moment you enter you are engulfed in the perfume. Month by
month, year by year, you live with the master. The perfume goes on
penetrating into the deepest layers of your consciousness – and with the
perfume, the master is also entering you.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you will be far away the instructions are: remember the
perfume. And you will be surprised that whenever you remember the
perfume, suddenly the presence of the master is there. And all that has
been happening in the presence of the master starts happening in his
absence. The source is within you.</p><p><br></p><p>These are just strategies. I have not been using anything like that,
for the simple reason that I trust more in your love than in any
association with something mundane.</p><p><br></p><p>If you love me, you can materialize me anywhere you want.</p><p><br></p><p>And no perfume is higher than the perfume of love. No music is more
musical than the music of love.</p><p><br></p><p>I have not used anything. In a few schools of mystics, music is used
– the same tune, so that whenever you hear the tune or remember the
tune, you will be transported from your actual surroundings into those
surroundings that you always wanted to be in.</p><p><br></p><p>But these are very mundane strategies. I would like to be more
straightforward. I would not like anything to stand between me and you –
even to remind you. I want immediate contact. I want, categorically,
immediacy, no mediator, because nothing works more miraculously than
love.</p><p><br></p><p>All those old masters had to use other things because about love,
they were afraid. Their own fear of love made them choose third-rate
things to help you. I am not afraid of anything – particularly of
love.</p><p><br></p><p>So in my presence remember: meditation is easy because in my presence
love is easy. So wherever you are, be loving.</p><p>Be loving to the people you are with, be loving to the sky you see.
Be loving to the trees you move by.</p><p><br></p><p>Just be loving – and whenever you are thrilled with love you will
find I am walking by your side, sitting by your side, that my hand is in
your hand – who says that I am far away? And you will immediately have
the proof because mediation will be coming from all sides running,
flooding you.</p><p>And once you have found it, that it can happen anywhere, then the
last dependence has ended. Then my presence is no longer a need for you.
That does not mean that you don’t love me anymore; in fact, just the
contrary. How can you love totally when there is some kind of
dependence? You can love totally only when there is no dependence.</p><p><br></p><p>One of Buddha’s intimate disciples, Sariputta, became enlightened in
Buddha’s lifetime. But he would not say it to Buddha, he was trying hard
to hide it. He was doing things which only an unenlightened person can
do.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally Buddha had to call him, and say, “Sariputta, you can’t
deceive me. You stop all this nonsense of doing things, saying things
just to hide the fact that you have become enlightened. Why are you so
afraid? Why don’t you simply say what has happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>Sariputta said, “I am truly afraid. I was postponing this
enlightenment as much as possible because I knew when I became
enlightened you would say, ‘Sariputta, now you go, reach the people,
help the people. Now you don’t need me, so why do you go on hanging
around?’ I did everything to avoid it but what was to happen, has
happened, and now you have found out – please don’t send me away.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “But you don’t need me anymore. Your excuse to be with
me for so many years was that without me you cannot become enlightened;
now you have become enlightened, your excuse is no longer valid.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sariputta’s statement is very significant. He said, “Yes, my excuse
is no longer valid, and I don’t need you. But I am going to stay with
you because it is you and your love that has made me so independent –
even independent of my own master. Just to show my gratitude, just to
touch your feet every day<span class=s4></span>I refuse to go anywhere
else.</p><p><br></p><p>“I was with you up to now with a need; now I am going to be with you
without any need. For the first time my love is simply pure – no
motivation, no desire<span class=s4></span>just pure gratitude.”</p><p><br></p><p>When the need disappears, the gratitude arises. When dependence
disappears, a tremendous feeling, that what you were and what you have
become<span class=s4></span>the distance is so vast that unless
the</p><p>presence of the master was a miracle, it is not explainable.</p><p><br></p><p>So whenever you feel that it is difficult to meditate without me,
remember my love for you, remember your love for me.</p><p><br></p><p>Love immediately destroys distances.</p><p><br></p><p>And you will find me as much present as I am here – or even more. And
once you have found it, then there is no problem: wherever you are,
meditation is your own, it is your own energy. Still you can go on
coming.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not so hard as Gautam Buddha. You must have seen Gautam Buddha’s
marble statues. He was just like that – cold as a marble statue, even
when he was alive. A beautiful man, an immensely miraculous man, but he
was very cold.</p><p>I am a totally different person. My compassion is not of somebody who
is higher than you; my compassion is very human, because I understand
the days of the dark nights. I have been through those dark nights – I
know how you must be suffering in those dark nights. But it is all up to
you: you can prolong the dark night, or you can end it and bring the
sunrise immediately into your life.</p><p><br></p><p>I have called you my friend. Remember that word.</p><p><br></p><p>I promise you to be with you whenever you need me. Just need me!
Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>THE GERMAN MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS DOESN’T ALLOW YOU TO ENTER
GERMANY. DO YOU WANT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT?</p><p><br></p><p>It seems that no government will allow me in any country. It is a
good sign. It means they have started recognizing me.</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot be recognized by winning a Nobel Prize. I can be recognized
only by the way America has treated me, India is treating me, Germany is
treating me. But I am surprised about Germany. I have never been to
Germany; naturally I cannot commit any crime in Germany under German
law. It must be something unprecedented, that a person who has never
been to your country, has not done any harm to your country – you have
to decide beforehand, in case he comes, that he should not be allowed to
enter.</p><p><br></p><p>It shows a great recognition of a single individual who has no powers
– governments are so afraid. They must be wrong, there must be something
that they are afraid of which my presence can expose.</p><p><br></p><p>I say it is a good sign – I love it. I will refuse a Nobel Prize
because that is bourgeois but I cannot refuse such a beautiful
recognition; that simply fits with me.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing I would like to tell you is that Germany can prevent me
from entering the country but it cannot prevent me from entering the
heart of the German people, particularly German youth. And of course
they cannot prevent me from allowing the German youth to enter into my
heart.</p><p><br></p><p>And my work is invisible – I need not go to Germany. But those who
love me can come to me wherever I am. And if their love is strong enough
then they can find me amongst them. I need not enter the country; still
I can be with my sannyasins.</p><p><br></p><p>My presence depends on their love, not on the visa that the
government issues.</p><p><br></p><p>But it simply shows the poverty of your so-called great powers. You
should be happy and rejoice the day I cannot find any place to stay
anywhere in the world. You have to dance and sing and rejoice that this
is happening for the first time.…</p><p><br></p><p>Because Socrates was condemned in Athens, and Athens was only a city
state. The judges had told him, “You can leave Athens and there will be
no punishment for you. And there is the whole world – why should you
unnecessarily get poisoned? Just leave Athens.”</p><p>Jesus was crucified in Judea – a very small place. Nobody had heard
about him while he was alive. And he did not die on the cross either.
Not that there was any resurrection; he was simply brought down from the
cross within six hours – and on the Jewish cross it needs twenty-four
hours, sometimes forty-eight hours, for a person to die.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a negotiation between Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, and
one of the influential men who wanted Jesus to be saved. So this was the
agreement: on Friday Jesus should be crucified – but as late as possible
so he is not too long on the cross. Jews stop all work as the sun sets
on Friday, and Saturday is the day of sabbath; they don’t do anything.
So it was delayed as long as possible; only in the afternoon when the
sun was going down was Jesus crucified. And before the sun set he had to
be brought down because of the Jewish tradition.</p><p><br></p><p>Now he had to wait in the cave. He would have to be crucified again
after the sabbath ends – and that was the time when he was stolen. He
was taken out of Judea. He lived in India up to one hundred and twelve
years – a very ripe age. He died in India – I have been to his grave in
Kashmir, and a strange coincidence: Kashmir has the graves of Jesus and
Moses too.</p><p><br></p><p>But nowhere was he hindered, nowhere was he persecuted, nowhere was
he crucified again. In India he lived a long life. He was thirty-three
when he was crucified in Judea, and he lived up to one hundred and
twelve years without any persecution.</p><p><br></p><p>So this is something to rejoice about, that I may be the first man in
the whole of history who is being persecuted around the world. But this
is not bad news, it is good news. It means I have threatened all the
powers of the world – religious, political, social. A single man,
single-handedly has been able to prove the impotency and poverty of all
great powers, great theologians, great organized religions. What more
reward can I receive?</p><p><br></p><p>And this is going to help the movement. It means you have got a
master, not just a goody-goody saint!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

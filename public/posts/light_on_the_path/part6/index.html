They are so deeply in order within themselves that no order outside is needed.\nAnarchism is basically the transformation of the individual in such a way that the government becomes superfluous. He lives in the light of his consciousness, fully aware of what he is doing, fully aware of its consequences, aware that it is not his right to interfere with any individual’s life, or to trespass – even in very subtle matters like conversion. Making an effort to convert somebody to your ideology is a trespass of that individual’s consciousness. Unless he invites you, it is aggression.\nSo individuals have to be so conscious that no aggressive activity on any level – bodily, mental, emotional – is possible for them. Then the government is absolutely useless, a burden. And certainly the idea is that, if people can live without a government, then only are they people. If they need a government that means they are still coming out of animality. They have not yet become human. They need masters, governors, they are not capable of being on their own. They are basically asking to be slaves. The existence of a government of any kind means that the people are asking\nfor slavery; and to ask for slavery and then to ask for democracy, freedom, freedom of expression, and individuality, becomes contradictory.\nSo the governments go on promising all these things but in the very existence of the government they are denied. Hence all governments are frauds. They can only promise but they cannot perform. It is existentially impossible. If they can perform then they are not needed. If they cannot perform that is why they are needed. So every government is more or less symbolic of the fact that human beings have not grown up to their full height, to their full potential.\nYou are asking, “Are gnosticism and anarchy in some way related?” They are... because gnosticism means knowledge of your own. There are two kinds of knowledge. One is borrowed, either from books or from teachers, or from parents, or from the environment, the society in which you live. Unconsciously you go on absorbing so many things.\nThis is not knowledge in the sense of gnosticism. This is a false substitute for true knowledge, and it is a hindrance. True knowledge is the discovery of truth, of love, of compassion, of all that is great in human life – by yourself.\nEvery Buddhist scripture begins: “I have heard Gautam the Buddha say” It is a hearsay, it is not\nknowledge. You may have heard Gautam the Buddha say something – that does not mean that you have come to know it. It may become part of your memory, you may be able to repeat it like a parrot.That’s all that your priests, your pundits, are doing all over the world – simply repeating\nexactly the way the parrot repeats, without knowing what he is saying.\nThe pundits don’t know what they are saying. They have heard, they have memorized; their memory is good, but their intelligence does not exist.\nTrue knowledge means your own experience, your own search – and when you know yourself there is no need to believe in anything. Every belief is poisonous because every belief will hinder you in searching for the truth.\nNow the whole world believes in something or other. You ask anybody about God – either he believes that God existsand there are a few who believe that God does not exist; but both are beliefs. The\ncommunist believes that God does not exist, but he has not explored, he has not gone into his own consciousness – what to say about the whole existence? He has not explored his own small being.\nAnd there are millions who say, “We believe in the existence of God.” But your belief cannot create a God – if he does not exist your belief makes no difference. And if you believe in a God, naturally your seeking stops. Why should one seek and search when he believes? That’s why all the religions emphasize faith, so that they can stop your search.\nFaith is a block.\nSearch means you are still doubting, you are still not certain. Faith means you are absolutely certain that God exists. Now there is no question of enquiring. And if man goes on believing in such things which imply many absurdities.…\nFor example. Galileo was told by the pope, “In your book you have to change the statement that the earth moves around the sun, because it goes against THE BIBLE”. THE BIBLE says that the sun goes around the earth, and that’s everybody’s experience too. Certainly it appears so. In the morning it rises, in the evening it goes down – it looks as if it is going around the earth.\nGalileo was seventy-five years old – he was almost dragged from his deathbed to the court to give an apology, because anything that is said in THE BIBLE cannot be disbelieved. It is the word of God; no enquiry is possible.\nGalileo said, “Such a small thing which has nothing to do with religion at all.What does it matter\nwhether the sun moves around the earth or the earth moves around the sun? It has no religious significance.”\nThe pope said, “It is not a question of religious significance. The question is that if one thing is wrong in THE BIBLE, then the faith is shaken – perhaps other things may be also wrong. If God has some stupid idea, then what is the guarantee that other things that are said are not of the same quality? So not a single word can be questioned.”\nGalileo must have been a man with a great sense of humor. He said, “To me it makes no difference. I will change it in the book, I will write that the sun moves around the earth, but my statement will not make any difference at all. The earth will go on moving around the sun, in spite of my statement. How can my statement make any difference to the earth?”\nAnd that’s what he did. He changed his statement and in a note, a footnote, he wrote: “It makes no difference to the earth or to the sun – they go on their way. I am changing it because I don’t want to be unnecessarily harassed in my old age.”\nAnd it has been so continuously since Galileo: everything that science comes to discover goes against THE BIBLE. Again and again the same problem arises. Because science has been progressing in the West, the struggle has been between science and Christianity.\nBut if we look, the same question is valid about every religion. Hinduism believes that the earth is flat, not round. But no Hindu makes a point of saying that the idea should be discarded, it goes against our researches. In the Hindu scriptures it says that the sun is smaller than the earth, which is absolutely nonsense – the sun is sixty thousand times bigger than the earth. But no Hindu even bothers.\nAnd most fundamentally, in the first place these things should not be in the religious scriptures, because religion has nothing to do with the size of the sun or the size of the earth. We should take out everything that is not religious from the religious scriptures.\nReligious scriptures will need, every ten years, a new edition, because science will go on progressing, enquiring. And the way science enquires and progresses is exactly the way of man’s inner search. He also doubts, questions, is skeptical, tries to find the truth himself. He becomes a lab unto himself.\nGautam Buddha could not find any God within himself. He searched to the very ultimate core of his being and he found no God. And if God is not existent in human consciousness, then God cannot be existent in the mountains, in the trees, which are far lower.\nAnd the people who have come to the idea of God and have been preaching it, how have they found it? Where have they found it, and what is their method of finding it? Nothing is said about it in any scripture – you simply have faith. But why should one have faith in anybody else, who may be lying, who may be disillusioned himself, who may be insane?\nI cannot conceive that Moses encountered God, because God is not a person. So if anything happened, it must have been an illusion, it must have been a projection. And projections are very easy. Just go on a three-week fast, and your mind starts losing the capacity to ask questions. Your mind starts coming to a point where you cannot divide what is dream and what is real.\nIt is just as it happens to small children. They were dreaming of a beautiful toy and they wake up: the toy is not there and they are crying – “Where is my toy?” And you cannot convince them, “You were dreaming, and this is reality. You have changed the whole dimension. That was your fiction, your idea, your mind and your imagination, and this is reality. It has nothing to do with your mind and your imagination.”\nAll the religions have been teaching fasting. Nobody has bothered to ask why all the religions are agreed on fasting. My own understanding is that the reason is that after a certain time of fasting.… Your intelligence needs protein continuously to remain functioning. After three weeks the reservoir of protein in your brain is exhausted – then you are again in the state of a child. You don’t know what is dream and what is real.\nIt is those moments when people have realized Jesus Christ, Krishna, Gautam Buddha, Mahavira, or whatever has been always conditioned in their mind; it becomes projected. And they don’t now have intelligence enough to feel the distinction between the real and the unreal.\nThe people like Moses or Jesus who have said that they have encountered God face to face must have been in such a state – which can be experimentally created. And things are very clear: a Christian never comes to see Krishna; a Hindu never comes to see Christ because a Hindu mind is not being continuously conditioned to Christ – he sees Krishna. The Buddhist never sees Krishna, the Jaina never sees Krishna.\nYou will be surprised that according to Jaina scriptures, Krishna is suffering in the seventh hell because he was the cause of the greatest war this country has suffered, of the whole violence. And in fact there is some truth in it.\nArjuna was not willing to fight. He wanted to retire from fighting; he wanted to go to the Himalayas to meditate. He said, “It is better – the others can keep the throne. Anyway they are my brothers. And what is the point of killing all these people?” – because it was a family struggle and both parties were connected in many ways.\nArjuna’s own master, who had made him the best archer in the world, was on the other side because he was also the master of his brothers.\nKrishna was fighting on the side of Arjuna, and his own army was fighting on the other side because both parties had approached Krishna to join them.\nHe said, “Now this is difficult. I am alone – how can I join two parties? You are both friends so you can choose: I will fight from one side and my army will fight from the other side.”\nIt was a very strange war in which everybody was related. The grandfather of Arjuna, whom he loved and respected, was on the other side. The people with whom he was fighting were his cousin- brothers – whom he had played and grown up with. Millions of people would be killed.\nAnd his argument was absolutely valid: “After killing all these people, sitting on the throne on all these corpses is absolutely meaningless. I will not be happy, I will be miserable my whole life. What will I gain? I won’t even have people to celebrate with. Killing my own people with my own hands does not seem worthwhile. It gives me a clear idea that it is better to go to the mountains and to meditate and to forget all about this.”\nBut Krishna persisted. When he could not continue to argue he brought in the last argument: “It is God’s will. Now you cannot disbelieve in God’s will, and it is God’s will that you should fight.”\nNow this has been the strategy of all the priests all over the world – “God’s will.” But I am surprised that a man of the intelligence of Arjuna did not ask, “If you know God’s will, why is he not speaking directly to me? If it is God’s will, you fight. But as far as I am concerned, I feel this is God’s will – that I drop out of this chariot and go to the mountains.”\nIn his place, that’s what I would have done. “Then that’s perfectly good: if that is God’s will for you... to me this is God’s will. And if I have to choose I will choose my own rather than choosing yours.”\nBut it has been used to simply destroy your arguments, your intelligence, and create fear. If you don’t believe in God then there is hell. If you believe, then you have paradise and all the pleasures.\nThe Christian goes on seeing Christ, the Hindu goes on seeing Krishna, the Buddhist goes on seeing Buddha. And to see these people, simple psychological methods have been used: you should continuously pray. That makes you gullible.\nA man waking up in the morning starts praying to Krishna the first thing – or to Christ; goes to the church, listens to the priest, reads THE BIBLE or the GITA, which all preach, “Have faith.” And it is repeated thousands of times his whole life.\nThere are people who become monks and move to a monastery – they are the most prone to experience God because twenty-four hours a day they have nothing else to do except go on repeating a certain mantra, a certain name. They become hypnotized with the name, with the figure.\nAnd all the religions teach that fasting purifies you. I don’t understand how hunger can purify. If hunger purifies people then why should we try to destroy poverty? We are destroying pure people, spiritual people! We should make everybody hungry!\nHunger cannot purify. And look deeply into it: while you are hungry you think that you are not eating, but your body is absorbing your own flesh. That’s why you go on losing weight; otherwise where does your weight go?\nI have been condemned by Jainas because I said, at their conferences, “To fast is almost equal to meat-eating – and you pretend to be nonviolent people, vegetarians. But fasting means non- vegetarianism – you are eating yourself.”\nA very healthy man can live through a fast of three months; but after three months he will be just a skeleton, and then death is certain because now he has no more reserve to absorb. He cannot absorb bones.\nBut all these people have stopped their following from thinking. I said, “My challenge is, that it is a simple fact that you lose weight – I simply ask where your weight disappears. You absorb it.\n“Your body needs some energy every day. Working, walking, sitting – whatever you are doing, your body needs energy, and food is simply fuel. If you are not giving it fuel, then the body starts eating itself – it has a dual system just for emergency purposes. There may be a time when food is not available, you may be lost in a forest; the body accumulates some flesh for such times.” But you cannot raise such questions.\nAnd secondly, if you fast you are depriving your intelligence.\nThere is a hierarchy – just as in every household there is a certain division; that if you are hungry you won’t purchase a television, you will purchase food which is a more basic necessity. But if you have enough food you are not going to go on purchasing food. You will start thinking of purchasing something else – better furniture, a better house, a television, or radio or literature or music. You will start, but if suddenly your money is gone then the first things to go will be the higher things. The television will go first, the radio will go. You will retain your basic needs to the very last.\nAnd that’s how it happens when you fast. The first attack is on intelligence because that is the highest in you, and not a basic factor – for life can exist without it; all the animals exist without it. So your intelligence starts disappearing.\nIf you remain hungry your love, which you have always thought such a great quality, will start disappearing. A hungry man cannot be loving. To a hungry man you cannot give beautiful literature to read, or beautiful music to listen to. That will simply be an ugly joke. He needs food.\nSo if you fast for three weeks – I have fasted, and I talk only about things which I have tried – after three weeks it becomes difficult to figure out whether you are dreaming or whether it is a reality. You just cannot make the distinction. The faculty that used to make the distinction is no longer there.\nThat is the reason that all the religions insist on fasting. They disagree on everything else, but they don’t disagree on basic elements – fasting, praying, continuous chanting, going to the church or the temple or the mosque, remaining absolutely faithful to the holy book – it may be the KORAN, it may be the GITA, it may be THE BIBLE, it does not matter. But if you see, then the basic things are similar and their function is similar.\nGnosticism is a very revolutionary concept, and it never became a mass phenomenon. It always remained a very small stream of chosen people who had dropped all the nonsense the masses had been following, and who had tried on their own to reach into the inner core of their being.\nFaith does not change you, you remain the same, but a gnostic experience transforms you. And that is the only criterion to be used – whether your knowledge is true or your knowledge is borrowed, whether it changes you or it simply becomes accumulated in your memory. You can become a good teacher, a good priest, a good leader, but you cannot become a good man.\nIt happened that just in the last part of the last century, Rani Rasmani built a temple in Calcutta, in Dakshineshwar on the bank of the Ganges. But Rani Rasmani was not a high-caste Hindu, she was a sudra, she was untouchable. So no brahmin was ready to worship in her temple, although she was immensely rich and she was ready to give as much money as you wanted. And she explained to the brahmins, “I have not even entered the temple; I simply go up to the steps and bow down from there. I have not entered the inner shrine; I have not even seen the statue of Krishna that is inside the temple. It is made with my money, but money cannot be sudra because money is continuously changing hands from sudra to brahmin, from brahmin to chhatriya. So you cannot call the temple a sudra temple.” But no brahmin was ready to be a priest in her temple – all over Bengal she searched.\nRamakrishna agreed. He was uneducated. There are only two classes of Bengali, and he was very poor. The whole village tried to prevent him but they all knew he was a little eccentric: if he decides, then he decides.\nThey talked much about it, that it was built by a sudra. He said, “All the temples are made by sudras because the labor, the craftsmen – they all belong to the sudra. Every temple is made by sudras. Can you show me a temple which is made by brahmins?” Not only are they made by sudras, but the most beautiful parts are made by Mohammedans because they have a traditional craftsmanship in marble. What they can do nobody else can do.\nSo Ramakrishna said, “All temples are made by sudras, there is no question about it. And money does not matter – money goes on moving. And I cannot refuse her because it is a question of Krishna being there, unworshipped. You have made Krishna also a sudra, an untouchable. The rani herself cannot enter. I am going.”\nHe went. The rani was happy but alerted because the man looked a little eccentric. But someone was better than no one, so she accepted Ramakrishna. And then complaints started coming about Ramakrishna.\nThe complaints were that sometimes he fights with Krishna. Rather than worshipping him, he shouts at him, fights with him. He uses vulgar language before him – he came from a village. Sometimes just to punish him he does not give Krishna food. And sometimes he dances the whole day from morning to evening, praying to Krishna.\nThe rani asked Ramakrishna, “What is going on?”\nHe said, “Everything is going well. When he is good to me I am good to him, and when he is nasty to me I am nasty to him. Sometimes I am praying for hours and he does not appear; then I punish him the next day: I don’t give him food. That brings him to his senses. Certainly I also don’t eat that day. I cry the whole day because I have not given food to him, I have not even opened the door – I have let it remain locked.”\nOne experience of Ramakrishna will show you how illusions can be created. In the beginning – it was the birthday of Krishna – he told him, “You have to appear today. It is no ordinary day, it is your birthday. I will dance and sing the whole day and the whole night. And if you don’t appear” – a sword used to hang there in the temple – he said, “I will take the sword and cut off my head.”\nHe danced the whole day; the evening came, the night came. It was in the middle of the night – everything was silent. The temple is in a lonely place on the Ganges. Hungry the whole day, dancing the whole day, tired, utterly tired, he was continuously singing and praying, “Appear to me!” Then he pulled out the sword and was going to cut off his head when, at that moment, Krishna appeared. The sword fell from Ramakrishna’s hand when he saw Krishna.\nNow, it is so simple – a psychological matter. If you do such things you lose the balance of your mind. And Ramakrishna was childish in his behavior, in his living. He was praised as a saint because he was childlike, but because he was childlike he was experiencing Krishna face to face.\nOne of the great masters was passing through India.… There is a tradition of many masters: they go around the Ganges, all the way to the source, and then back along the other bank to where it falls into the ocean. One master was simply passing by and he came to know about Ramakrishna – that he sees Krishna. He laughed. He said, “The man must be innocent but gullible. He must be innocent but childlike.”\nHe remained in the temple; he talked to Ramakrishna. He explained to him what was happening: “What you are doing is all your creation. It is your imagination. Rama does not appear to you, Vishnu does not appear to you, Shiva does not appear to you. There is no question of Christ and Moses and others. Why does only Krishna appear to you? It is your imagination. And if you put so much pressure on your mind that you are going to cut off your head, naturally the mind is going to do anything to save your life.”\nRamakrishna said, “Then you help me to get rid of this illusion.”\nThe master said, “I can help, but the real thing has to be done by you. You sit silently, close your eyes, and when Krishna appears before your eyes, just cut him into two pieces and he will fall apart. There is nothing in it.”\nRamakrishna asked, “From where do I bring a sword to cut him?”\nAnd the master said, “From wherever you have brought this Krishna! If you can bring Krishna, from the same imagination you can bring a sword and cut him in two.”\nRamakrishna tried three or four times, but the moment he saw Krishna he would start swaying and he would forget the sword and the cutting and the master and all his teaching.\nThe master said, “You are impossible! I am wasting my time. When you see Krishna appear in your mind you don’t cut him; rather you start swaying. And I can see on your face that you are enjoying the experience.”\nRamakrishna said, “I know that I am wasting your time, but what am I to do, because when he appears I simply forget myself.”\nSo the master said, “I will bring a piece of glass, and when I see that you have started swaying and your face is looking ecstatic, I will cut exactly in the middle of your forehead with the glass to remind you that this is the time. You do the same: take the sword and cut Krishna in two.”\nHe actually cut the forehead of Ramakrishna, and Ramakrishna gathered courage and cut Krishna inside. He remained for six hours in absolute silence, and when he opened his eyes, his first words were, “The last barrier has fallen... the last barrier has fallen.”\nOur own imagination is our last barrier. Once we are without imagination then reality is there face to face. It is not Christian, it is not Hindu, it is not Mohammedan.\nGnosticism simply says this much: Each individual should follow his own inner being, dropping thoughts, imagination, emotions, sentiments – anything that comes in the way. It is not you. The simple principle of gnosticism is that anything that you can see as an object is not you. You are the seer, so you cannot be the seen. “I can see the furniture, then I am not the furniture. Whatever I can see, I am not it.”\nSo go on dropping all that you can see inside yourself until you come to a space where you cannot see anything. Just the seer remains in its utter purity, innocence. And that is the moment of a great revolution – perhaps the only revolution there is, because the seer cannot see anything, there is nothing to obstruct it.\nThat is the meaning of the word “object.” Object means “that which obstructs you.” There is no object there – all is empty. It can go as far as... but there is nothing. Then it turns upon itself, then it becomes its own object.\nWhen the subject itself becomes its own object – in other words when the observer is the observed too, when the knower is the known too – you have arrived home. And that is the meaning of gnosticism.\nThere is a certain relationship between anarchism and gnosticism because both depend on the individual. And anarchism will be impossible without gnosticism, because only gnosticism can transform people and can bring such quality and energy in them that they don’t need any government at all.\nA man of awareness does not need anybody else to tell him what to do, what not to do. He does not need the moral teacher, the priest, the policeman, the judge. They all become meaningless.\nAnd it will become one of the greatest days in the history of man when government becomes useless and is to be dropped. That means man has transcended all animality in him – violence, anger, hatred – all that needs a government to control people; otherwise there will be so many rapes, and there will be so many murders. There will be so many thefts, and nobody will be safe.\nThe government is simply an agreement of the society. “We are not capable of controlling ourselves – we need a central control, powerful enough so that individuals cannot dare... or if they dare to do something, then they can be punished.” Even with the government crime goes on growing, the jails go on growing, the judges go on growing, the criminals go on growing, the laws go on growing.\nSo if you simply remove the government, there will be chaos, and all that is repressed in man out of fear... because both government and religion, the two powerful institutions, use fear and greed to repress your animal. They don’t change it. If you are caught the government will send you to jail to be punished. If you are not caught, then the religions will send you to hell to suffer.\nIt is a basic agreement that if your action is found out, it becomes a crime; if it is not found out, it remains a sin. But on both bases the fear is there that you will have to suffer. And on the other hand, if you remain good the government has rewards. You become padam shree, you become bharat bhushan, you have a Nobel Prize, and so many awards around the world for people who have proved... who have repressed everything that can be objectionable – they are rewarded. And if they are not rewarded here, they will be rewarded in paradise with all the pleasures of the world.\nBut this is only a strategy to keep man’s animality somehow repressed. It does not bring any change. Gnosticism means a change in your very being.\nThen you don’t need any fear; you don’t need any hell, and you don’t need any awards. You don’t need any heaven, because to transcend your animality is the greatest reward possible. It is so blissful and so ecstatic to become really human that there is no need for anything else to be added to it. So gnosticism has no God, has no heaven, no hell – those are religious types of government.\nSo I can see a relationship between anarchism and gnosticism. But gnosticism is more fundamental, has to happen first; only then can anarchism have a chance. Up to now it has remained a utopia.\nTo single individuals it has happened, but it has to happen to the whole of humanity. And when it happens to single individuals, it is very strange: the governments are not happy. And now you can understand why they are not happy.\nThe very happening of the transformation of the human being so that he has no animality in him, creates a fear in government and in the religious hierarchy because that man shows that it can happen to all. And the moment it happens to all, governments and religions both will be useless, discarded. And nobody who has so much power would like to be discarded. No government wants to be discarded, no religion wants to be discarded.\nSo a very strange thing – they go on teaching people to be good, but deep down they want you to remain the same because their whole existence is dependent on your being they way you are.\nI have been talking to politicians, to religious leaders, and I have pointed it out: “Are you really interested in man becoming absolutely good? Then the saint will not be a saint, because everybody will be so good. What is the point of somebody being a saint?\n“We remember Gautam Buddha as a great saint because the whole society was not good. So he stands out. But if the whole society was good he would be lost in the crowd – there would be no need to remember him. Why do we go on remembering only a few names in the whole of history? For the simple reason that they stood out.\n“Everybody has the capacity to stand in the same position as Gautam Buddha. The governments, the politicians, want people the way they are. They may talk about change, but nobody wants any change because change in the people means change in the vested interests.\n“Now, if nobody commits a crime what will happen to all your courts? What will happen to all your jails and your police and all your law-enforcement agencies? They will simply be out of employment.\n“And if people are good and nobody wants to fight, nobody wants to kill anybody – if people refuse, and say, ‘Why should we kill any Pakistani or any Chinese?’... Or a Pakistani refuses to kill, and says, ‘Why should we kill a Hindustani? There is no reason, because this man has done nothing to me. He has children and he has a wife and he may have an old mother, a father to look after. I am not going to kill him. There is no reason for me to kill.’\n“What will happen to your governments, your armies?”\nThey are all against me because I have been saying things like this which can cut them from their very roots. They have no arguments against me – then the only way is to create any lies, any allegations and anything they want to say about me. But nobody answers the question.\nSo it is a very strange state. The government exists to keep people good – but that is not true. It exists to keep people as they are, not to allow them to go through a revolution.\nA better kind of people will need a better kind of government, a better kind of religion. And if people are really perfect they don’t need any government, they don’t need any religion. They are their own government and they are their own religion.\nSo the perfect man is continuously being killed.\nYou killed Socrates because he was a perfect man. That was his only crime. He has not done anything wrong in his whole life, and he asked the court, “Why are you going to kill me? What crime have I committed except that I have not committed any crime?”\nBut he was dangerous. A simple man, a very perfect man, is looked on as dangerous by the society, by the religious people, by the government, by all the authorities, because he creates a situation in which every man can think, “If it can happen to Socrates, why can’t it happen to me?” He can become an example. He can trigger a certain consciousness in the whole of humanity.\nHe has to be destroyed before he becomes a wildfire and people start being just like him.\nSocrates was blamed by the court; they said, “You have been corrupting human beings” – a strange allegation. “Corrupting human beings, particularly the youth.” To teach the youth to become perfect human beings is seen by the authorities to be corrupting them, because it means death to the authorities; whether they are religious or secular, it does not matter.\nSo on the one hand these people go on trying to make a show that they are trying to create a better society. On the other hand they go on killing the examples of perfection.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6022","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/light_on_the_path/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/light_on_the_path/>Light on the Path</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">6 Follow your inner being, then no government is needed</h1><div class=post-meta>29 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6022 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Light_on_the_Path/part6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

need any government. They are so deeply in order within themselves that
no order outside is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Anarchism is basically the transformation of the individual in such a
way that the government becomes superfluous. He lives in the light of
his consciousness, fully aware of what he is doing, fully aware of its
consequences, aware that it is not his right to interfere with any
individual’s life, or to trespass – even in very subtle matters like
conversion. Making an effort to convert somebody to your ideology is a
trespass of that individual’s consciousness. Unless he invites you, it
is aggression.</p><p><br></p><p>So individuals have to be so conscious that no aggressive activity on
any level – bodily, mental, emotional – is possible for them. Then the
government is absolutely useless, a burden. And certainly the idea is
that, if people can live without a government, then only are they
people. If they need a government that means they are still coming out
of animality. They have not yet become human. They need masters,
governors, they are not capable of being on their own. They are
basically asking to be slaves. The existence of a government of any kind
means that the people are asking</p><p>for slavery; and to ask for slavery and then to ask for democracy,
freedom, freedom of expression, and individuality, becomes
contradictory.</p><p><br></p><p>So the governments go on promising all these things but in the very
existence of the government they are denied. Hence all governments are
frauds. They can only promise but they cannot perform. It is
existentially impossible. If they can perform then they are not needed.
If they cannot perform that is why they are needed. So every government
is more or less symbolic of the fact that human beings have not grown up
to their full height, to their full potential.</p><p><br></p><p>You are asking, “Are gnosticism and anarchy in some way related?”
They are... because gnosticism means knowledge of your own. There are
two kinds of knowledge. One is borrowed, either from books or from
teachers, or from parents, or from the environment, the society in which
you live. Unconsciously you go on absorbing so many things.</p><p><br></p><p>This is not knowledge in the sense of gnosticism. This is a false
substitute for true knowledge, and it is a hindrance. True knowledge is
the discovery of truth, of love, of compassion, of all that is great in
human life – by yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Every Buddhist scripture begins: “I have heard Gautam the Buddha
say<span class=s4></span>” It is a hearsay, it is not</p><p>knowledge. You may have heard Gautam the Buddha say something – that
does not mean that you have come to know it. It may become part of your
memory, you may be able to repeat it like a parrot.<span class=s4></span>That’s all that your priests, your pundits, are doing
all over the world – simply repeating</p><p>exactly the way the parrot repeats, without knowing what he is
saying.</p><p><br></p><p>The pundits don’t know what they are saying. They have heard, they
have memorized; their memory is good, but their intelligence does not
exist.</p><p><br></p><p>True knowledge means your own experience, your own search – and when
you know yourself there is no need to believe in anything. Every belief
is poisonous because every belief will hinder you in searching for the
truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the whole world believes in something or other. You ask anybody
about God – either he believes that God exists<span class=s4></span>and there are a few who believe that God does not
exist; but both are beliefs. The</p><p>communist believes that God does not exist, but he has not explored,
he has not gone into his own consciousness – what to say about the whole
existence? He has not explored his own small being.</p><p><br></p><p>And there are millions who say, “We believe in the existence of God.”
But your belief cannot create a God – if he does not exist your belief
makes no difference. And if you believe in a God, naturally your seeking
stops. Why should one seek and search when he believes? That’s why all
the religions emphasize faith, so that they can stop your search.</p><p><br></p><p>Faith is a block.</p><p><br></p><p>Search means you are still doubting, you are still not certain. Faith
means you are absolutely certain that God exists. Now there is no
question of enquiring. And if man goes on believing in such things which
imply many absurdities.…</p><p>For example. Galileo was told by the pope, “In your book you have to
change the statement that the earth moves around the sun, because it
goes against THE BIBLE”. THE BIBLE says that the sun goes around the
earth, and that’s everybody’s experience too. Certainly it appears so.
In the morning it rises, in the evening it goes down – it looks as if it
is going around the earth.</p><p>Galileo was seventy-five years old – he was almost dragged from his
deathbed to the court to give an apology, because anything that is said
in THE BIBLE cannot be disbelieved. It is the word of God; no enquiry is
possible.</p><p>Galileo said, “Such a small thing which has nothing to do with
religion at all.<span class=s4></span>What does it matter</p><p>whether the sun moves around the earth or the earth moves around the
sun? It has no religious significance.”</p><p>The pope said, “It is not a question of religious significance. The
question is that if one thing is wrong in THE BIBLE, then the faith is
shaken – perhaps other things may be also wrong. If God has some stupid
idea, then what is the guarantee that other things that are said are not
of the same quality? So not a single word can be questioned.”</p><p>Galileo must have been a man with a great sense of humor. He said,
“To me it makes no difference. I will change it in the book, I will
write that the sun moves around the earth, but my statement will not
make any difference at all. The earth will go on moving around the sun,
in spite of my statement. How can my statement make any difference to
the earth?”</p><p>And that’s what he did. He changed his statement and in a note, a
footnote, he wrote: “It makes no difference to the earth or to the sun –
they go on their way. I am changing it because I don’t want to be
unnecessarily harassed in my old age.”</p><p>And it has been so continuously since Galileo: everything that
science comes to discover goes against THE BIBLE. Again and again the
same problem arises. Because science has been progressing in the West,
the struggle has been between science and Christianity.</p><p>But if we look, the same question is valid about every religion.
Hinduism believes that the earth is flat, not round. But no Hindu makes
a point of saying that the idea should be discarded, it goes against our
researches. In the Hindu scriptures it says that the sun is smaller than
the earth, which is absolutely nonsense – the sun is sixty thousand
times bigger than the earth. But no Hindu even bothers.</p><p>And most fundamentally, in the first place these things should not be
in the religious scriptures, because religion has nothing to do with the
size of the sun or the size of the earth. We should take out everything
that is not religious from the religious scriptures.</p><p>Religious scriptures will need, every ten years, a new edition,
because science will go on progressing, enquiring. And the way science
enquires and progresses is exactly the way of man’s inner search. He
also doubts, questions, is skeptical, tries to find the truth himself.
He becomes a lab unto himself.</p><p>Gautam Buddha could not find any God within himself. He searched to
the very ultimate core of his being and he found no God. And if God is
not existent in human consciousness, then God cannot be existent in the
mountains, in the trees, which are far lower.</p><p>And the people who have come to the idea of God and have been
preaching it, how have they found it? Where have they found it, and what
is their method of finding it? Nothing is said about it in any scripture
– you simply have faith. But why should one have faith in anybody else,
who may be lying, who may be disillusioned himself, who may be
insane?</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot conceive that Moses encountered God, because God is not a
person. So if anything happened, it must have been an illusion, it must
have been a projection. And projections are very easy. Just go on a
three-week fast, and your mind starts losing the capacity to ask
questions. Your mind starts coming to a point where you cannot divide
what is dream and what is real.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just as it happens to small children. They were dreaming of a
beautiful toy and they wake up: the toy is not there and they are crying
– “Where is my toy?” And you cannot convince them, “You were dreaming,
and this is reality. You have changed the whole dimension. That was your
fiction, your idea, your mind and your imagination, and this is reality.
It has nothing to do with your mind and your imagination.”</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions have been teaching fasting. Nobody has bothered to
ask why all the religions are agreed on fasting. My own understanding is
that the reason is that after a certain time of fasting.… Your
intelligence needs protein continuously to remain functioning. After
three weeks the reservoir of protein in your brain is exhausted – then
you are again in the state of a child. You don’t know what is dream and
what is real.</p><p><br></p><p>It is those moments when people have realized Jesus Christ, Krishna,
Gautam Buddha, Mahavira, or whatever has been always conditioned in
their mind; it becomes projected. And they don’t now have intelligence
enough to feel the distinction between the real and the unreal.</p><p><br></p><p>The people like Moses or Jesus who have said that they have
encountered God face to face must have been in such a state – which can
be experimentally created. And things are very clear: a Christian never
comes to see Krishna; a Hindu never comes to see Christ because a Hindu
mind is not being continuously conditioned to Christ – he sees Krishna.
The Buddhist never sees Krishna, the Jaina never sees Krishna.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised that according to Jaina scriptures, Krishna is
suffering in the seventh hell because he was the cause of the greatest
war this country has suffered, of the whole violence. And in fact there
is some truth in it.</p><p><br></p><p>Arjuna was not willing to fight. He wanted to retire from fighting;
he wanted to go to the Himalayas to meditate. He said, “It is better –
the others can keep the throne. Anyway they are my brothers. And what is
the point of killing all these people?” – because it was a family
struggle and both parties were connected in many ways.</p><p><br></p><p>Arjuna’s own master, who had made him the best archer in the world,
was on the other side because he was also the master of his
brothers.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna was fighting on the side of Arjuna, and his own army was
fighting on the other side because both parties had approached Krishna
to join them.</p><p>He said, “Now this is difficult. I am alone – how can I join two
parties? You are both friends so you can choose: I will fight from one
side and my army will fight from the other side.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was a very strange war in which everybody was related. The
grandfather of Arjuna, whom he loved and respected, was on the other
side. The people with whom he was fighting were his cousin- brothers –
whom he had played and grown up with. Millions of people would be
killed.</p><p><br></p><p>And his argument was absolutely valid: “After killing all these
people, sitting on the throne on all these corpses is absolutely
meaningless. I will not be happy, I will be miserable my whole life.
What will I gain? I won’t even have people to celebrate with. Killing my
own people with my own hands does not seem worthwhile. It gives me a
clear idea that it is better to go to the mountains and to meditate and
to forget all about this.”</p><p><br></p><p>But Krishna persisted. When he could not continue to argue he brought
in the last argument: “It is God’s will. Now you cannot disbelieve in
God’s will, and it is God’s will that you should fight.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now this has been the strategy of all the priests all over the world
– “God’s will.” But I am surprised that a man of the intelligence of
Arjuna did not ask, “If you know God’s will, why is he not speaking
directly to me? If it is God’s will, you fight. But as far as I am
concerned, I feel this is God’s will – that I drop out of this chariot
and go to the mountains.”</p><p><br></p><p>In his place, that’s what I would have done. “Then that’s perfectly
good: if that is God’s will for you... to me this is God’s will. And if
I have to choose I will choose my own rather than choosing yours.”</p><p><br></p><p>But it has been used to simply destroy your arguments, your
intelligence, and create fear. If you don’t believe in God then there is
hell. If you believe, then you have paradise and all the pleasures.</p><p><br></p><p>The Christian goes on seeing Christ, the Hindu goes on seeing
Krishna, the Buddhist goes on seeing Buddha. And to see these people,
simple psychological methods have been used: you should continuously
pray. That makes you gullible.</p><p><br></p><p>A man waking up in the morning starts praying to Krishna the first
thing – or to Christ; goes to the church, listens to the priest, reads
THE BIBLE or the GITA, which all preach, “Have faith.” And it is
repeated thousands of times his whole life.</p><p><br></p><p>There are people who become monks and move to a monastery – they are
the most prone to experience God because twenty-four hours a day they
have nothing else to do except go on repeating a certain mantra, a
certain name. They become hypnotized with the name, with the figure.</p><p><br></p><p>And all the religions teach that fasting purifies you. I don’t
understand how hunger can purify. If hunger purifies people then why
should we try to destroy poverty? We are destroying pure people,
spiritual people! We should make everybody hungry!</p><p><br></p><p>Hunger cannot purify. And look deeply into it: while you are hungry
you think that you are not eating, but your body is absorbing your own
flesh. That’s why you go on losing weight; otherwise where does your
weight go?</p><p>I have been condemned by Jainas because I said, at their conferences,
“To fast is almost equal to meat-eating – and you pretend to be
nonviolent people, vegetarians. But fasting means non- vegetarianism –
you are eating yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>A very healthy man can live through a fast of three months; but after
three months he will be just a skeleton, and then death is certain
because now he has no more reserve to absorb. He cannot absorb
bones.</p><p><br></p><p>But all these people have stopped their following from thinking. I
said, “My challenge is, that it is a simple fact that you lose weight –
I simply ask where your weight disappears. You absorb it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Your body needs some energy every day. Working, walking, sitting –
whatever you are doing, your body needs energy, and food is simply fuel.
If you are not giving it fuel, then the body starts eating itself – it
has a dual system just for emergency purposes. There may be a time when
food is not available, you may be lost in a forest; the body accumulates
some flesh for such times.” But you cannot raise such questions.</p><p><br></p><p>And secondly, if you fast you are depriving your intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a hierarchy – just as in every household there is a certain
division; that if you are hungry you won’t purchase a television, you
will purchase food which is a more basic necessity. But if you have
enough food you are not going to go on purchasing food. You will start
thinking of purchasing something else – better furniture, a better
house, a television, or radio or literature or music. You will start,
but if suddenly your money is gone then the first things to go will be
the higher things. The television will go first, the radio will go. You
will retain your basic needs to the very last.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s how it happens when you fast. The first attack is on
intelligence because that is the highest in you, and not a basic factor
– for life can exist without it; all the animals exist without it. So
your intelligence starts disappearing.</p><p><br></p><p>If you remain hungry your love, which you have always thought such a
great quality, will start disappearing. A hungry man cannot be loving.
To a hungry man you cannot give beautiful literature to read, or
beautiful music to listen to. That will simply be an ugly joke. He needs
food.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you fast for three weeks – I have fasted, and I talk only about
things which I have tried – after three weeks it becomes difficult to
figure out whether you are dreaming or whether it is a reality. You just
cannot make the distinction. The faculty that used to make the
distinction is no longer there.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the reason that all the religions insist on fasting. They
disagree on everything else, but they don’t disagree on basic elements –
fasting, praying, continuous chanting, going to the church or the temple
or the mosque, remaining absolutely faithful to the holy book – it may
be the KORAN, it may be the GITA, it may be THE BIBLE, it does not
matter. But if you see, then the basic things are similar and their
function is similar.</p><p><br></p><p>Gnosticism is a very revolutionary concept, and it never became a
mass phenomenon. It always remained a very small stream of chosen people
who had dropped all the nonsense the masses had been following, and who
had tried on their own to reach into the inner core of their being.</p><p>Faith does not change you, you remain the same, but a gnostic
experience transforms you. And that is the only criterion to be used –
whether your knowledge is true or your knowledge is borrowed, whether it
changes you or it simply becomes accumulated in your memory. You can
become a good teacher, a good priest, a good leader, but you cannot
become a good man.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened that just in the last part of the last century, Rani
Rasmani built a temple in Calcutta, in Dakshineshwar on the bank of the
Ganges. But Rani Rasmani was not a high-caste Hindu, she was a sudra,
she was untouchable. So no brahmin was ready to worship in her temple,
although she was immensely rich and she was ready to give as much money
as you wanted. And she explained to the brahmins, “I have not even
entered the temple; I simply go up to the steps and bow down from there.
I have not entered the inner shrine; I have not even seen the statue of
Krishna that is inside the temple. It is made with my money, but money
cannot be sudra because money is continuously changing hands from sudra
to brahmin, from brahmin to chhatriya. So you cannot call the temple a
sudra temple.” But no brahmin was ready to be a priest in her temple –
all over Bengal she searched.</p><p><br></p><p>Ramakrishna agreed. He was uneducated. There are only two classes of
Bengali, and he was very poor. The whole village tried to prevent him
but they all knew he was a little eccentric: if he decides, then he
decides.</p><p><br></p><p>They talked much about it, that it was built by a sudra. He said,
“All the temples are made by sudras because the labor, the craftsmen –
they all belong to the sudra. Every temple is made by sudras. Can you
show me a temple which is made by brahmins?” Not only are they made by
sudras, but the most beautiful parts are made by Mohammedans because
they have a traditional craftsmanship in marble. What they can do nobody
else can do.</p><p><br></p><p>So Ramakrishna said, “All temples are made by sudras, there is no
question about it. And money does not matter – money goes on moving. And
I cannot refuse her because it is a question of Krishna being there,
unworshipped. You have made Krishna also a sudra, an untouchable. The
rani herself cannot enter. I am going.”</p><p><br></p><p>He went. The rani was happy but alerted because the man looked a
little eccentric. But someone was better than no one, so she accepted
Ramakrishna. And then complaints started coming about Ramakrishna.</p><p><br></p><p>The complaints were that sometimes he fights with Krishna. Rather
than worshipping him, he shouts at him, fights with him. He uses vulgar
language before him – he came from a village. Sometimes just to punish
him he does not give Krishna food. And sometimes he dances the whole day
from morning to evening, praying to Krishna.</p><p><br></p><p>The rani asked Ramakrishna, “What is going on?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Everything is going well. When he is good to me I am good
to him, and when he is nasty to me I am nasty to him. Sometimes I am
praying for hours and he does not appear; then I punish him the next
day: I don’t give him food. That brings him to his senses. Certainly I
also don’t eat that day. I cry the whole day because I have not given
food to him, I have not even opened the door – I have let it remain
locked.”</p><p>One experience of Ramakrishna will show you how illusions can be
created. In the beginning – it was the birthday of Krishna – he told
him, “You have to appear today. It is no ordinary day, it is your
birthday. I will dance and sing the whole day and the whole night. And
if you don’t appear” – a sword used to hang there in the temple – he
said, “I will take the sword and cut off my head.”</p><p><br></p><p>He danced the whole day; the evening came, the night came. It was in
the middle of the night – everything was silent. The temple is in a
lonely place on the Ganges. Hungry the whole day, dancing the whole day,
tired, utterly tired, he was continuously singing and praying, “Appear
to me!” Then he pulled out the sword and was going to cut off his head
when, at that moment, Krishna appeared. The sword fell from
Ramakrishna’s hand when he saw Krishna.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, it is so simple – a psychological matter. If you do such things
you lose the balance of your mind. And Ramakrishna was childish in his
behavior, in his living. He was praised as a saint because he was
childlike, but because he was childlike he was experiencing Krishna face
to face.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the great masters was passing through India.… There is a
tradition of many masters: they go around the Ganges, all the way to the
source, and then back along the other bank to where it falls into the
ocean. One master was simply passing by and he came to know about
Ramakrishna – that he sees Krishna. He laughed. He said, “The man must
be innocent but gullible. He must be innocent but childlike.”</p><p><br></p><p>He remained in the temple; he talked to Ramakrishna. He explained to
him what was happening: “What you are doing is all your creation. It is
your imagination. Rama does not appear to you, Vishnu does not appear to
you, Shiva does not appear to you. There is no question of Christ and
Moses and others. Why does only Krishna appear to you? It is your
imagination. And if you put so much pressure on your mind that you are
going to cut off your head, naturally the mind is going to do anything
to save your life.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ramakrishna said, “Then you help me to get rid of this illusion.”</p><p><br></p><p>The master said, “I can help, but the real thing has to be done by
you. You sit silently, close your eyes, and when Krishna appears before
your eyes, just cut him into two pieces and he will fall apart. There is
nothing in it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ramakrishna asked, “From where do I bring a sword to cut him?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the master said, “From wherever you have brought this Krishna! If
you can bring Krishna, from the same imagination you can bring a sword
and cut him in two.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ramakrishna tried three or four times, but the moment he saw Krishna
he would start swaying and he would forget the sword and the cutting and
the master and all his teaching.</p><p><br></p><p>The master said, “You are impossible! I am wasting my time. When you
see Krishna appear in your mind you don’t cut him; rather you start
swaying. And I can see on your face that you are enjoying the
experience.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ramakrishna said, “I know that I am wasting your time, but what am I
to do, because when he appears I simply forget myself.”</p><p>So the master said, “I will bring a piece of glass, and when I see
that you have started swaying and your face is looking ecstatic, I will
cut exactly in the middle of your forehead with the glass to remind you
that this is the time. You do the same: take the sword and cut Krishna
in two.”</p><p><br></p><p>He actually cut the forehead of Ramakrishna, and Ramakrishna gathered
courage and cut Krishna inside. He remained for six hours in absolute
silence, and when he opened his eyes, his first words were, “The last
barrier has fallen... the last barrier has fallen.”</p><p><br></p><p>Our own imagination is our last barrier. Once we are without
imagination then reality is there face to face. It is not Christian, it
is not Hindu, it is not Mohammedan.</p><p><br></p><p>Gnosticism simply says this much: Each individual should follow his
own inner being, dropping thoughts, imagination, emotions, sentiments –
anything that comes in the way. It is not you. The simple principle of
gnosticism is that anything that you can see as an object is not you.
You are the seer, so you cannot be the seen. “I can see the furniture,
then I am not the furniture. Whatever I can see, I am not it.”</p><p><br></p><p>So go on dropping all that you can see inside yourself until you come
to a space where you cannot see anything. Just the seer remains in its
utter purity, innocence. And that is the moment of a great revolution –
perhaps the only revolution there is, because the seer cannot see
anything, there is nothing to obstruct it.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the meaning of the word “object.” Object means “that which
obstructs you.” There is no object there – all is empty. It can go as
far as... but there is nothing. Then it turns upon itself, then it
becomes its own object.</p><p><br></p><p>When the subject itself becomes its own object – in other words when
the observer is the observed too, when the knower is the known too – you
have arrived home. And that is the meaning of gnosticism.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a certain relationship between anarchism and gnosticism
because both depend on the individual. And anarchism will be impossible
without gnosticism, because only gnosticism can transform people and can
bring such quality and energy in them that they don’t need any
government at all.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of awareness does not need anybody else to tell him what to do,
what not to do. He does not need the moral teacher, the priest, the
policeman, the judge. They all become meaningless.</p><p><br></p><p>And it will become one of the greatest days in the history of man
when government becomes useless and is to be dropped. That means man has
transcended all animality in him – violence, anger, hatred – all that
needs a government to control people; otherwise there will be so many
rapes, and there will be so many murders. There will be so many thefts,
and nobody will be safe.</p><p><br></p><p>The government is simply an agreement of the society. “We are not
capable of controlling ourselves – we need a central control, powerful
enough so that individuals cannot dare... or if they dare to do
something, then they can be punished.” Even with the government crime
goes on growing, the jails go on growing, the judges go on growing, the
criminals go on growing, the laws go on growing.</p><p>So if you simply remove the government, there will be chaos, and all
that is repressed in man out of fear... because both government and
religion, the two powerful institutions, use fear and greed to repress
your animal. They don’t change it. If you are caught the government will
send you to jail to be punished. If you are not caught, then the
religions will send you to hell to suffer.</p><p>It is a basic agreement that if your action is found out, it becomes
a crime; if it is not found out, it remains a sin. But on both bases the
fear is there that you will have to suffer. And on the other hand, if
you remain good the government has rewards. You become padam shree, you
become bharat bhushan, you have a Nobel Prize, and so many awards around
the world for people who have proved... who have repressed everything
that can be objectionable – they are rewarded. And if they are not
rewarded here, they will be rewarded in paradise with all the pleasures
of the world.</p><p>But this is only a strategy to keep man’s animality somehow
repressed. It does not bring any change. Gnosticism means a change in
your very being.</p><p>Then you don’t need any fear; you don’t need any hell, and you don’t
need any awards. You don’t need any heaven, because to transcend your
animality is the greatest reward possible. It is so blissful and so
ecstatic to become really human that there is no need for anything else
to be added to it. So gnosticism has no God, has no heaven, no hell –
those are religious types of government.</p><p>So I can see a relationship between anarchism and gnosticism. But
gnosticism is more fundamental, has to happen first; only then can
anarchism have a chance. Up to now it has remained a utopia.</p><p>To single individuals it has happened, but it has to happen to the
whole of humanity. And when it happens to single individuals, it is very
strange: the governments are not happy. And now you can understand why
they are not happy.</p><p>The very happening of the transformation of the human being so that
he has no animality in him, creates a fear in government and in the
religious hierarchy because that man shows that it can happen to all.
And the moment it happens to all, governments and religions both will be
useless, discarded. And nobody who has so much power would like to be
discarded. No government wants to be discarded, no religion wants to be
discarded.</p><p>So a very strange thing – they go on teaching people to be good, but
deep down they want you to remain the same because their whole existence
is dependent on your being they way you are.</p><p>I have been talking to politicians, to religious leaders, and I have
pointed it out: “Are you really interested in man becoming absolutely
good? Then the saint will not be a saint, because everybody will be so
good. What is the point of somebody being a saint?</p><p>“We remember Gautam Buddha as a great saint because the whole society
was not good. So he stands out. But if the whole society was good he
would be lost in the crowd – there would be no need to remember him. Why
do we go on remembering only a few names in the whole of history? For
the simple reason that they stood out.</p><p>“Everybody has the capacity to stand in the same position as Gautam
Buddha. The governments, the politicians, want people the way they are.
They may talk about change, but nobody wants any change because change
in the people means change in the vested interests.</p><p>“Now, if nobody commits a crime what will happen to all your courts?
What will happen to all your jails and your police and all your
law-enforcement agencies? They will simply be out of employment.</p><p><br></p><p>“And if people are good and nobody wants to fight, nobody wants to
kill anybody – if people refuse, and say, ‘Why should we kill any
Pakistani or any Chinese?’... Or a Pakistani refuses to kill, and says,
‘Why should we kill a Hindustani? There is no reason, because this man
has done nothing to me. He has children and he has a wife and he may
have an old mother, a father to look after. I am not going to kill him.
There is no reason for me to kill.’</p><p><br></p><p>“What will happen to your governments, your armies?”</p><p><br></p><p>They are all against me because I have been saying things like this
which can cut them from their very roots. They have no arguments against
me – then the only way is to create any lies, any allegations and
anything they want to say about me. But nobody answers the question.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is a very strange state. The government exists to keep people
good – but that is not true. It exists to keep people as they are, not
to allow them to go through a revolution.</p><p><br></p><p>A better kind of people will need a better kind of government, a
better kind of religion. And if people are really perfect they don’t
need any government, they don’t need any religion. They are their own
government and they are their own religion.</p><p><br></p><p>So the perfect man is continuously being killed.</p><p><br></p><p>You killed Socrates because he was a perfect man. That was his only
crime. He has not done anything wrong in his whole life, and he asked
the court, “Why are you going to kill me? What crime have I committed
except that I have not committed any crime?”</p><p><br></p><p>But he was dangerous. A simple man, a very perfect man, is looked on
as dangerous by the society, by the religious people, by the government,
by all the authorities, because he creates a situation in which every
man can think, “If it can happen to Socrates, why can’t it happen to
me?” He can become an example. He can trigger a certain consciousness in
the whole of humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>He has to be destroyed before he becomes a wildfire and people start
being just like him.</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates was blamed by the court; they said, “You have been
corrupting human beings” – a strange allegation. “Corrupting human
beings, particularly the youth.” To teach the youth to become perfect
human beings is seen by the authorities to be corrupting them, because
it means death to the authorities; whether they are religious or
secular, it does not matter.</p><p><br></p><p>So on the one hand these people go on trying to make a show that they
are trying to create a better society. On the other hand they go on
killing the examples of perfection.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

WHEN LIEH TZU WAS EATING AT THE ROADSIDE ON A JOURNEY TO WEI, HE SAW A HUNDRED-YEAR-OLD SKULL.

IS IT HE WHO IS TRULY MISERABLE, IS IT WE WHO ARE TRULY HAPPY?</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
You are blessed
20 February 1977 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
DO YOU HAVE FAVOURITES? AM I ONE OF THEM?
I am reminded of an Arabian proverb.
It is said that whenever God creates a person he whispers into his ear ‘You are my favourite. I have never made such a beautiful person before, and I am not going to make such a beautiful person again.</description>

A MAN CAME OUT FROM WITHIN A STONE CLIFF, RISING AND FALLING WITH THE SMOKE AND ASHES.</description>

This is not Kaaba
22 February 1977 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
THE PUNDIT IN TODAY’S STORY – WAS HE NOT ALSO A BEAUTIFUL TAOIST? PERHAPS NOT REACHED THE OCEAN, BUT ON THE WAY?
He can be called a Taoist, but not a man of Tao. Taoist in the sense that he believes that Tao is true, but not a man of Tao because his belief is unbased.</description>

‌CHAPTER 14
Just give way
24 February 1977 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
THE WORD ‘ESOTERIC’ HAS BEEN USED IN A VERY SACRED SENSE. WOULD YOU PLEASE TELL US WHAT INSPIRES YOU TO USE IT IN A RIDICULOUS AND HUMOROUS SENSE?
The question is from Yoga Chinmaya.
The word ‘esoteric’ means the hidden – it is ridiculous because nothing is hidden. All is obvious, God is obvious; if you cannot see, it is not because God is hidden, but because you are keeping your eyes closed.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Sublime laziness
12 February 1977 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
WHERE DOES EDUCATING THE SUBCONSCIOUSNESS CONFLICT OR HARMONISE WITH TAO, AS IT IMPLIES DISCIPLINE WITH SELF-EFFORT FROM AN EXTERNAL EXPRESSION?
Tao knows nothing of discipline. Tao is anarchic, spontaneous, effortless. All disciplines are unnatural – they have to be. Nature needs no discipline, it is sufficient unto itself. Trees and rivers and animals and stars – they don’t know anything of discipline.</description>

WHEN CONFUCIUS WAS ROAMING ON MOUNT T’AI, HE SAW JUNG CH’I CH’I WALKING ON THE MOORS OF CH’ANG IN A ROUGH FUR COAT WITH A ROPE ROUND HIS WAIST, SINGING AS HE STRUMMED A LUTE.
‘MASTER, WHAT IS THE REASON FOR YOUR JOY?’ ASKED CONFUCIUS.
‘I HAVE MANY JOYS. OF THE MYRIAD THINGS WHICH HEAVEN BEGOT, MANKIND IS THE MOST NOBLE – AND I HAVE THE LUCK TO BE HUMAN.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
No bargain with reality
14 February 1977 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
WHAT IS NOT ILLUSION?
All is illusion except the witness. All is dream except the witness. Only the knower is true, is real. Whatsoever you see is illusory; the seer is not illusory. In the night you see one type of dream, in the day you see another type of dream.</description>

I am a cross to you
16 February 1977 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
I SEE THE SWAMIS EAT SO WELL AND SO OFTEN, AND HAVEN’T HEARD YOU MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT THIS DIET. IT IS SAID FOOD QUICKENS THE SPERM AND IS A SIN TO EAT FOR THE TONGUE. IT SHOULD FIRST BE OFFERED TO THE GODS ETC.
The first thing: I am not a believer in fasting, I believe in feasting.</description>

17 February 1977 am in Buddha Hall
TZU KUNG GREW WEARY OF STUDY AND TOLD CONFUCIUS ‘I WANT TO FIND REST.’ ‘THERE IS NO REST FOR THE LIVING.’
‘THEN SHALL I NEVER FIND IT?’
‘YOU SHALL. LOOK FORWARD TO THE LOFTY AND DOMED MOUND OF YOUR TOMB AND KNOW WHERE YOU SHALL FIND REST.’
‘GREAT IS DEATH! THE GENTLEMAN FINDS REST IN IT, THE MEAN MAN SUBMITS TO IT!</description>

Putting shoes on a snake
18 February 1977 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
CAN ONE BELIEVE IN TAO, NOT INTERFERING WITH OTHER PEOPLE’S LIVES, ACCEPTING WHAT IS NOW, AND BY PROFESSION BE A PSYCHOTHERAPIST? WHAT, OR HOW, IS A TAO WAY OF DOING THERAPY?
It is from Poonam.
It is of tremendous significance.
The first thing: ‘Can one believe in Tao.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
Only forgotten
19 February 1977 am in Buddha Hall
SOMEONE ASKED LIEH TZU
‘WHY DO YOU VALUE EMPTINESS’?
‘IN EMPTINESS THERE IS NO VALUING.’ LIEH TZU SAID
’VALUE IS NOT THE NAME FOR IT. BEST BE STILL, BEST BE EMPTY. IN STILLNESS AND EMPTINESS, WE FIND WHERE TO ABIDE; TAKING AN GIVING,
WE LOSE THE PLACE.’
Truth is one – cannot be otherwise because existence is a universe, it is not a ‘multiverse’.</description>

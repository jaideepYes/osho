OF THE MYRIAD THINGS WHICH HEAVEN BEGOT, MANKIND IS THE MOST NOBLE – AND I HAVE THE LUCK TO BE HUMAN. THIS IS MY FIRST JOY. PEOPLE ARE BORN WHO DO NOT LIVE A DAY OR A MONTH, WHO NEVER GET OUT OF THEIR SWADDLING CLOTHES, BUT I HAVE ALREADY LIVED TO NINETY. THIS IS MY JOY. FOR ALL MEN, POVERTY IS THE NORM AND DEATH IS THE END. ABIDING BY THE NORM, AWAITING MY END, WHAT IS THERE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT?’\n‘GOOD!’SAID CONFUCIUS ’HERE IS A MAN WHO KNOWS HOW TO CONSOLE HIMSELF.’\nTHIS IS a beautiful parable, and not only beautiful but very subtle. If you look only on the surface, you will miss the meaning. Taoist parables are not on the surface. They are very deep, and they have to be penetrated and looked and meditated upon, then only will you know the real meaning. On the surface, this parable seems as if it is in favour of Confucius; on the surface; it seems that the parable is saying that Confucius is wise. The reality is just the opposite.\nThere is a great diametrical opposition between the Taoist attitude and the Confucian attitude; Confucius is as far away from the Taoist vision as possible. Confucius believes in law, Confucius\nbelieves in tradition, Confucius believes in discipline. Confucius believes in character, morality, culture, society, education. Tao believes in spontaneity, individuality, freedom. Tao is rebellious; Confucius is very conformist.\nTaoism is the profoundest non-conformism that has ever been evolved anywhere in the world, at any time in history; essentially it is rebellion. So there has been a rebellion and the Taoist mystics, Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu and Lieh Tzu, go on ridiculing the Confucian attitude. This is a parable of ridicule. You will understand it when I explain it to you. Their ridicule is also very subtle, not gross. First let us understand the surface meaning.\nWHEN CONFUCIUS WAS ROAMING ON MOUNT T’AI, HE SAW JUNG CH’I CH’I WALKING ON THE MOORS OF CH’ANG IN A ROUGH FUR COAT WITH A ROPE ROUND HIS WAIST, SINGING AS HE STRUMMED A LUTE.\nSinging, music, dancing, are the language of joy, of happiness. They are an expression that the person is not miserable. But it may be just an appearance, it may be just projected, it may be just cultivated; deep down the situation may be just the opposite. Sometimes it happens that you laugh because you don’t want to cry. Sometimes it happens that you smile because tears are coming and, if you don’t smile, they will start rolling down your cheeks. Sometimes you maintain an attitude, a cultivated face, a mask, that you are happy, because what is the point of showing your unhappiness to the world? That’s why people look so happy. Everybody thinks he is the unhappiest person in the world. because he knows his reality and he knows only the faces of others the cultivated faces. So everybody deep down thinks: ‘I am the most miserable person, and why am I the most miserable person when everybody is so happy?’\nSinging, dancing, are certainly a language of joy, but you can learn the language without knowing what joy is. That’s what humanity has done: people have learned gestures – empty gestures.\nBut Confucius is deceived. He says\n‘MASTER, WHAT IS THE REASON FOR YOUR JOY?’\nThe mask has deceived Confucius; the man may be joyful, may not be joyful. The man has to be looked into directly – through his nature, not through his expression. The expression can be false: people have learned expression. Sometimes... do you watch? Somebody is smiling – on the lips there is a beautiful smile – and look into the eyes, and the eyes say something just the opposite. Somebody says something to you, ‘I love you’; and look at the face, and at the eyes, and the very vibe of the person, and it seems that he hates you. But just to be polite he is saying ‘I love you’.\nConfucius looked only at the appearance: that is the first thing to be remembered; and he was deceived – deceived so much that he called the man ‘Master’.\nHe says\n‘MASTER, WHAT IS THE REASON FOR YOUR JOY?’\nNow again, joy has no reason, joy cannot have a reason to it. If joy has any reason, it is not joy at all: joy can only be without any reason, uncaused. A disease has a reason, but health? Health\nis natural. If you go and ask the doctor ‘Why am I healthy?’ he cannot answer you. If you go to the doctor and you say ‘Why am I ill?’ he can answer you, because illness has a cause. He can diagnose your case, and he can find the reason why you are ill; but nobody has yet been able to find a reason why man is healthy. Health is natural, health is as it should be. Illness is as it should not be, illness means something has gone wrong. When everything is going well, one is healthy. When everything is in tune, one is healthy. When one is harmonious with the whole, one is healthy. There is no reason for it.\nBut Confucius asked\n‘MASTER, WHAT IS THE REASON FOR OUR JOY?’\nAgain Lieh Tzu is joking about Confucius, that’s how they are very subtle people. He is saying that the whole Confucian wrong attitude is there in the very question: Confucius thinks there are REASONS for joy. There cannot be any reasons for joy. Joy simply is – unexplained, unexplainable. When it is, it is; when it is not, it is not. When it is not, you can find the reasons why it is not; but when it is, you cannot find any reasons why it is. And if you can show the reasons why it is, then your joy is cultivated, not real, not true, not authentic. It is not flowing from your innermost core; it is just that you are managing it, you are manipulating it, you are pretending it. When a joy is a pretended joy, you can find out the reason. But when the joy is truly there, it is so mysterious, it is so primal, that you cannot find any reason in it.\nIf you ask a Buddha ‘Why are you happy?’ he will shrug his shoulders. If you ask Lao Tzu ‘Why are you blissful?’ he will say ‘Don’t ask it. Rather than asking why I am blissful, enquire why you are not.’\nIt is like a small spring in the mountains: when there is no hindrance, the spring flows; when there are rocks on the way, it cannot flow. When the rocks are removed.You don’t create the spring –\nyou only remove the negative, you only remove the obstacle. The spring was there, but because of the rock it was not able to flow. When you remove the rock you are not creating the spring – the spring was already there. By removing the rock you have removed the negative, the obstacle, and the spring flows. Now if somebody asks ‘Why does the spring flow?’ – because the spring is there, that’s why it flows. If it is not flowing, then there is a cause to it. Let this sink deep in you because it is your problem too.\nNever ask why you are happy, never ask why one is blissful, otherwise you have asked a wrong question. Never ask why there is a God. If you ask, you have asked a wrong question; and all the answers that can be given are bound to be wrong, because a wrong question provokes wrong answers. ‘Why is God?’ – that is irrelevant; it is simply the case.\nConfucius is asking something, and by asking that, he is showing his presuppositions: Confucius believes that everything has a cause. If everything has a cause, then only science can exist. Then there is no possibility for religion, because science is the enquiry into the cause-and-effect relationship, an enquiry into causation, an enquiry into causality. That is the whole scientific attitude: they say that if something is there, there must be a cause to it you may know, you may not know but the cause is bound to be there. ‘If we don’t know today, we will know tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, but the cause is bound to be known, because the cause must be there.’ This is the scientific attitude: everything can be reduced to its cause.\nAnd what is the religious attitude? Religion says that nothing can really be reduced to its cause. That which can be reduced is not essential. The essential simply is – it exists without any cause; it is mysterious. This is the meaning of mystery: there is no cause to it.\nConfucius is asking a question according to his presuppositions, according to his philosophy, ‘MASTER, WHAT IS THE REASON FOR YOUR JOY?’\nWhy is he asking? – so that, if the reason is known, others can also cultivate it. If somebody says ‘By standing on my head I become very peaceful’, you also stand on your head, and you become peaceful. Somebody says ‘I am happy because I have renounced the world’. so you also renounce the world, and you become happy. Then happiness becomes something that can be manipulated. This is how people are – imitating each other.\nAnd in fact there is no cause for happiness. The day you understand this, you can be happy any moment. If there is a cause, then the cause will take time: you will have to practise it, you will have to practise long. And the whole radical attitude of Tao is that you can be happy THIS moment.\nWhat does this mean? This means that there is no cause, so there is no need to practise. It is just a question of allowing it – is is already there if you ALLOW. If you don’t allow, you function like a rock: if you allow, the rock is removed. It is only a question of allowing it. God is there, you allow – that’s all. If you don’t allow, he will not enter because he cannot destroy your freedom, he protects your freedom. If you say ‘no’, he is not going to enter into your being. If on your door it is written that nobody is allowed without permission, he will wait. He is not even going to ask your permission – he will simply wait, because even to ask your permission is to interfere with your freedom. He will wait. He will not ring the bell. he will simply wait. God is everywhere, waiting, and he waits so silently... that’s why his presence is not felt, he looks almost absent. Can’t you see it? God seems to be the most absent thing in the world. That’s why atheists can exist, and they can say ‘Where is your God? We don’t see.…’ He is so non-interfering; he allows you total freedom. And total freedom implies in it to go against God.\nYour nature is that of bliss. You are made of the stuff called bliss. But you have to allow it, you have to relax, you have to be in a let-go; no cause is there – just let-go is needed. Hence, theoretically, it can happen at this very moment – not even a split second has to be wasted. If there is a cause, then... then a long time will be needed, and even then one never knows – you may succeed, you may not succeed.\nSee the difference between the Hindu attitude and the Taoist attitude. The Hindu, the Jain, the Buddhist – they all say: Past lives, KARMA, has to be removed. Much has to be done, great discipline is needed – only then will you be able to attain. Ashtavakra, Lao Tzu, Bodhidharma, Lin Chi say: Nothing is needed, just allow it. Relax, allow it, and this very moment it will start pouring in you.\nConfucius says\n‘MASTER, WHAT IS THE REASON FOR YOUR JOY?’\n‘Tell me how you have attained it. Tell me what was your process – what methodology you followed; what principles, what disciplines, what scriptures. How have you attained it?’ Now Confucius is greedy. He wants to attain to the same state where song is natural, and music flows, and one is celebrating. He is tremendously enchanted by this man because he is\n... IN A ROUGH FUR COAT WITH A ROPE ROUND HIS WAIST, SINGING AS HE STRUMMED A LUTE.\nA poor man has nothing to be happy for, has nothing to be happy about. If he were miserable, it would be understandable; if he were depressed, it would be understandable – Confucius would have passed by him, not even noticing his existence. But this poor man who has nothing,‘a rope round his waist’... singing? Singing a song of joy? Strumming a lute? Confucius is enchanted, magnetised, but he asks a wrong question.\nA Taoist will never ask such a question. Joy is, and SIMPLY is; it has no cause to it, hence no methods are possible, only understanding.\nThat man said\n‘I HAV MANY JOYS.’\nIf you have many joys, you have not understood what joy is, because joy is only one. There cannot be many joys. There can be many diseases, but there cannot be many ‘healths’. You may have your disease, I may have mine, somebody else has his own; but when I am healthy, you are healthy, somebody else is healthy – what is the difference? Can you make a distinction between my health and your health? There is no possibility of it: health is universal, disease is personal. Disease is of the ego, health is not of the ego. Disease is of the body, of the mind; health is of the beyond, and the beyond is one. My body differs from yours – naturally I will have a different disease, you will have a different disease, but health? Health is simply one. It has the taste, the same taste always, eternally the same.\nSomebody asked Buddha ‘What is the taste of your Buddhahood?’ He said ‘Go and taste the sea, and taste it from anywhere – from this bank, from any bank of any beach. Or go to the middle of the ocean and taste it there, or go to the other shore – and you will find the taste always the same: the same salty taste. Buddhahood has one taste.’ Whosoever has become a Buddha has come to the same taste. Health has the same taste. When the child is healthy, the young man is healthy, and the old man is healthy, then too it has the same taste. When the woman is healthy, the man is healthy – the same taste.\nBut diseases are different. Now, medical science says that even when two persons are suffering from the same disease, even then the two diseases are not the same. Hence sometimes it happens that you are suffering from some disease – maybe tuberculosis – and your wife is suffering from the same disease, tuberculosis, but the same medicines don’t work. You need one medicine, your wife needs some other medicine. That’s why the physician is needed; otherwise the chemist would be enough. If once it was decided that tuberculosis needed this medicine, then what would be the point in going to the physician? The chemist could supply it.\nNow, more and more, as medical science is going deeper into the phenomena of health and disease, they are becoming aware that each disease has a personality in it: it belongs to the person. So now they say: Don’t treat the disease, treat the person. Don’t be too much concerned with the disease. Look into the person. his total personality, his way of life, his attitudes, his habit patterns. Look into them, and then you will find that the name TB may be the same – because it would be very difficult to have separate names for everybody – but each person who suffers from tuberculosis suffers differently, and a different treatment is needed.\nDiseases are personal, but health? Health is impersonal, universal. So is joy. Misery is a disease; joy is health, well-being. Now Confucius has asked a wrong question, and provoked a wrong answer. And, of course, the man does not know anything about joy.\nHe says\n‘I HAVE MANY JOYS.’\nMany? Then something has gone wrong. Joy is one. When you say you have many joys, you don’t know what joy is. You may be talking about pleasures, you may be talking about your so-called ‘moments of happiness’ which are not really moments of happiness but only of less misery. A person is very miserable, then one day he feels less miserable and he says\n‘I am very happy.’ That is just relative; he does not know what happiness is.\nHe only knows sometimes very intense misery, sometimes not so intense. When it is not so intense, he says ‘I am happy.’ You can observe it in yourself. Have you ever known what happiness is? Do you know the taste of it? You have known only different stages of misery.\nSometimes the misery is so much that it is unbearable. Sometimes it is bearable, within control – you can tolerate it. You move from less misery to more misery, from more misery to less misery. But you have not known what happiness is, because once you have known what happiness is, then there is no need to be miserable at all – because then you have the key. You can open that door any moment you decide to open it. But you cannot open the door of happiness – that simply shows that you don’t have the key. You just know relative states of the same phenomenon: sometimes it is very dark and you cannot see at all, and sometimes it is not so dark, it is dim; but you have not known what light is. Light is not any relative state of darkness – light is not less darkness, remember light is a totally different kind of energy; it has nothing to do with darkness. Darkness and light cannot exist together in the same room. Light is a positivity, darkness is a negativity – so is misery.\nSaid the man\n‘I HAVE MANY JOYS. OF THE MYRIAD THINGS WHICH HEAVEN BEGOT, MANKIND IS THE MOST NOBLE – AND I HAVE THE LUCK TO BE HUMAN. THIS IS MY FIRST JOY.’\nOn the surface, it looks very meaningful, appealing, because very much fulfilling to the human ego. Man has always been thinking of himself as the superiormost creation of God. Man has always thought of himself only as NEXT to God, and feels very happy. But how is happiness possible through the ego? Unhappiness comes through the ego. And this is one of the greatest points of the\negoist: that man!s only next to God. That, too, we say only just to be polite; deep down you know that God is next to you.\nThe very idea of ‘I’ has in it an implication of being the first, and then everything is secondary. Friedrich Nietzsche is truer than many other people, he says: I cannot allow God to exist because then I am secondary, and I cannot be secondary; I cannot accept my status as secondary. If God is, then I will always be secondary. Howsoever I grow, and wherever I reach, I will be secondary – I will never be primary, the first. This is not acceptable, so he says: God is dead and man is free. God is the bondage. He is true – in a way. ‘In a way’ I say, because that’s how everybody thinks deep down: every ego wants God to be second.\nEven when you are a great worshipper, a great so-called ‘religious’ person, every moment you are trying to manipulate God according to you. ‘Do my will!’ That’s all that your prayer means: ‘Do according to me. Listen to me.’ Your whole effort is to convert God into your servant. You call him ‘Lord’, ‘Master’, but those are just briberies; you are trying to manipulate him. You say ‘I am nobody, you are all’; but deep down you know who is who. In fact, even when you fight for your God, it is YOUR God. Even when you sacrifice yourself on some pedestal, on some altar, it is to your God that you sacrifice. When you bow down to an image of God in a temple, in a mosque, in a church, it is to your image that you have created, it is to your God. You are bowing down in front of your own creation. You are bowing down as if before a mirror. You are reflected there and you say ‘How beautiful!’ When a Christian says ‘How beautiful Christ is’, when a Hindu says ‘How beautiful Krishna is’, and when a Buddhist says ‘How beautiful Buddha is’ – the Buddhist will not accept that Christ is beautiful because that does not fulfil his ego. The Christian will not accept that Buddha is beautiful – that does not fulfil his ego. The Hindu cannot believe that Christ or Mohammed or Moses are beautiful – that does not fulfil his ego.\nRemember: we are fulfilling our egos in every way possible – gross or subtle, direct or indirect. And a religious person is one who knows this, becomes aware of this, and in that awareness the ego disappears.\nA religious person has no idea of who is superior. A religious person cannot say ‘I am superior to the tree, I am superior to the animal, I am superior to the bird.’ A religious person cannot say ‘I am superior.’ A religious person has come to know ‘I am not’, and in that experience of ‘I am not’, joy flows in; the rock has been removed.\nNow this man says\n‘I HAVE MANY JOYS. OF THE MYRIAD THINGS WHICH HEAVEN BEGOT, MANKIND IS THE MOST NOBLE...’\nWhy? Why is mankind the most noble? If we look at human history, mankind seems to be the most ignoble. Look at the animals: they have not been so violent, so murderous; they have not been so insane. Have you ever seen any animal turning into a politician... trying to become the president of a country? They are not insane: they live naturally. they die naturally. Animals in the wild never go mad. Sometimes they go mad when they are forced to live in a zoo – the zoo is a human creation. Animals never commit suicide, but sometimes in the zoo they commit. Animals never turn homosexual in the natural wild state, but in the zoo they turn. In the zoo they become murderous?\ndangerous. Yes, they kill, but they kill only when they want to eat. Man kills for no reason. A man goes to the wild and kills a tiger and he says ‘This is play. This is game. I was hunting.’ Have you ever heard of any lion HUNTING? They never hunt. When a lion is hungry, of course he kills, and that’s a natural way for him.\nI have heard.…\nOnce a lion and a fox entered a restaurant – maybe Vrindavan. They took seats and the fox ordered, but the fox ordered only for one. So the waiter asked ‘And what about your friend?’\nAnd the fox said ‘What do you think? If he was hungry, should I be sitting here?’\nHe is not hungry – that is certain. When animals are hungry they kill, but they don’t kill as game, they don’t kill for fun; they are not interested in killing in itself. Of course they are interested in food – nothing is wrong in it; man kills for no reason. Animals don’t kill for ideologies: they don’t say ‘I am a Communist and you are a capitalist. I will kill you.’ They don’t say ‘I am a Fascist and you are a Communist sol will kill you.’ They don’t have any ideologies, and they don’t kill because they are Christians, Hindus and Mohammedans.\nMan kills for any excuse, for any excuse whatsoever. Hindus can kill Mohammedans, Mohammedans can kill Hindus, Christians can kill Mohammedans, and Buddhists... and so on and so forth. And for what? For abstract doctrines, principles – and nobody is ready to live for those doctrines and everybody is ready to kill others for those same doctrines. If somebody insults the Bible, the Christian is ready to kill you, and if you ask him ‘Are you living your Bible?’ he will say ‘It is very difficult.’ He is not interested in living it, nobody is interested in living it; but if it comes to killing, then everybody becomes very much interested:\nDown the centuries, in three thousand years, there have been five thousand wars. No, no animal is so ignoble – animals have a natural nobility. Man is very cunning.\nBut the man said\n‘... MANKIND IS THE MOST NOBLE – AND I HAVE THE LUCK TO BE HUMAN. THIS IS MY FIRST JOY.’\nThis is not joy. This is the pleasure that comes from feeling egoistic, that ‘I am somebody’. And remember, this cannot lead you to real happiness, because deep down there is comparison. If you are feeling superior, at any moment you can feel inferior.\nOnce I heard a religious man, a saint, a very well known saint in India, teaching his disciples: ‘Always look to people who don’t have as much as you have, and you will feel very happy. If you have a house, always look to people who don’t have a house.’ Naturally, you will feel happy. ‘If you have only one eye, look at the person who is blind... you will feel happy.’ But what type of happiness is this? And what type of religion is this? And naturally you cannot throw away the other aspect Or the coin. You have one eye – when you look at the blind person you feel happy. But when you come across a man who has two beautiful eyes, then what will you do? You will feel unhappy.\nIn your so-called ‘happiness’ unhappiness is implied.\nNo, through comparison nobody comes to joy. Joy is a non-comparative state. Don’t compare. I have heard...\nFather took Sonny to see a show which featured fifty of the most naked performers in the country.\n‘Phew! Phew! Phew!’ Father kept muttering all during the performance. ‘What’s the matter, Pop, don’t you like the show?’ Sonny asked.\n‘Sure I do’ he replied ‘I was thinking of your mother.’\nIf you are comparing, your comparison is going to create trouble. Remember: joy is not out of comparison – never.\nBut this man said\n‘I HAVE MANY JOYS. OF THE MYRIAD THINGS WHICH HEAVEN BEGOT, MANKIND IS THE MOST NOBLE – AND I HAVE THE LUCK TO BE HUMAN. THIS IS MY FIRST JOY.’\nThis is not much of a joy. It is just a titillation of the ego: you feel good, you feel superior. But a person who needs to be superior to feel good is a person who is carrying a volcano within him. A person who has to be superior to feel happy is suffering deep down from an inferiority complex. Only an inferior person thinks in terms of superiority. A real person, an authentic person. is neither superior nor inferior. He simply IS – unique; nobody is lower than him and nobody is higher than him.\nThe whole existence is equal. The trees and the rocks, and the animals and the birds, and men and women, and God – all are sharing the whole existence on equal terms. The moment you see this tremendous equality, this oneness, you are joyful. And then your joy has no cause. it is uncaused.\n‘PEOPLE ARE BORN WHO DO NOT LIVE A DAY OR A MONTH, WHO NEVER GET OUT OF THEIR SWADDLING CLOTHES. BUT I HAVE ALREADY LIVED TO NINETY. THIS IS MY JOY.’\nComparing... somebody was born and died, somebody was young and died, and this man is comparing: ‘I am ninety years of age, I have lived my life, so what is there to be miserable about? I am happy, I have lived more than others.’ But if those others had not died, then...? If he were alone in the world, then would this man be happy? Just think. The whole world disappears, only this man is left. There are no animals, no birds, no rocks – he cannot compare himself, and he cannot call himself ‘the superior man’. There are no young people dying, no children dying – he cannot compare himself, that he has lived ninety years of age. If he is left alone, will he be happy? All his happiness will disappear because it was coming from comparisons.\nTao says: If you are alone, absolutely alone, and your happiness still remains the same, then you have attained – otherwise you have not attained.\nA comparative happiness is a pseudo happiness. ‘I have a big car and you don’t have. Because you don’t have, I am happy.’ This is something foolish. How can I be happy because you don’t have a\ncar? What has it to do with my happiness that you don’t have a car? ‘I have a big house and you don’t have a big house, so I am happy.’ This happiness seems more interested in making others unhappy rather than in being happy oneself. ‘You don’t have a car, you don’t have a good house – I am happy because you are miserable.’ Look at the logic of it, the mathematics is simple: ‘I am happy when people are miserable, so if people are more miserable, I will be more happy; if the whole world is turned into hell, I will be supremely happy.’ This is the logic, and this is what man has been doing.\nIn Calcutta, I used to stay in a house, the most beautiful house in Calcutta. And the man was really in mad love with his house. It was a marble mansion, really beautiful, built with taste, with very aristocratic taste, and in Calcutta to have ten acres of garden in the middle of Calcutta was something impossible – and he had it. He was really in deep love with it, and whenever I stayed with him, he would take me to the swimming pool, to the garden, to the lawn; he would show me this and that – what improvements he had made since I had last been there. But the last time I went he was very miserable. I said ‘What is the matter? You have not taken me anywhere. Have you not done anything new?’\nHe said ‘My interest is gone. Can’t you see that by the side, my neighbour has made a better house? And unless I can make a bigger house than this, I will remain unhappy.’\nNow this man had the same house, but his happiness had disappeared.\n‘What has your happiness to do with your neighbour? If he has made a bigger house, how does this concern you? And your house remains the same! And you are no more happy. Then certainly’ I told him ‘then one thing is certain, that it was not your house that you were happy with. You were happy because of the neighbour’s poor house.’\nWatch. Always watch. This is violence to be happy when somebody is miserable. This is how people start moving in the wrong direction – become oppressors, become exploiters, become dangerous. They are a curse on the earth. But their whole logic is the same.\nWhat this man is saying is: ‘I am happier than others. Look: many people have died when they were young, and I am still alive, healthy, and I am ninety years of age. This is my joy.’\n‘FOR ALL MEN, POVERTY IS THE NORM AND DEATH IS THE END. ABIDING BY THE NORM, AWAITING MY END, WHAT IS THERE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT?’\nNow he says ‘Almost all men are poor, so that is the norm – to be poor; and naturally everybody is going to die, sol am going to die. I am poor, I am going to die, everybody is going to die, everybody else is poor, so why be miserable? That’s why I am happy.’\nThis is not happiness.\n‘GOOD!’ SAID CONFUCIUS...\nConfucius was very much impressed, he said\n‘GOOD!... HERE IS A MAN WHO KNOWS HOW TO CONSOLE HIMSELF.’\nBut in this sentence, Lieh Tzu has played the trick. He says that Confucius was very much impressed. He said\n‘GOOD!... HERE IS A MAN WHO KNOWS HOW TO CONSOLE HIMSELF’.\n... because for Confucius, to be satisfied in life is the goal, to have consolation is the goal. To ask for more, Confucius says, is to ask for the impossible. This is all that a man can have, and this man knows the way to console himself, and he is happy and he is singing.\nBut to the Taoist, consolation is negative – it is not contentment. Contentment has nothing to do with consolation; contentment is a totally different dimension. Try to understand it: consolation means somehow rationalising one’s situation – trying not to be worried, trying not to be too much concerned – creating buffers around one. That’s what Gurdjieff used to call ‘buffers’; everybody creates buffers around himself so that life is not so shocking.\nThey use buffers in the railway trains or springs in the cars, so that when you are moving on a hilly road – and life is a hilly track – you don’t go on bumping. Those springs function as buffers. If the road is rough, the roughness is absorbed by the springs, by the buffers – it does not reach you.\nSo-called ‘philosophies of consolation’ are buffers. You see that you are poor; a great unhappiness arises in you – create the buffer: ‘So many people are poor, millions of people are poor, so why be worried about it? This is how things are.’ You have created a buffer. You are ill; misery arises – go to the hospital, visit there and see people, and you will feel very happy. You have created a buffer: at least you are not as ill as others are. You have lost one leg – just go on the street and see a beggar who has lost both legs; feel consoled.\nThese are buffers: Always look to those who don’t even have as much as you have. That way life becomes less shocking, you live more conveniently, more comfortably, and you are not touched. By and by, between you and life there is such a distance created by the buffers that nothing ever reaches you. You live encapsulated inside your buffers, philosophies, consolations. Life ends one day – you can console yourself: Everybody has to die, it is nothing special happening to you, God is not especially unkind to you, it happens to everybody. Or you can start believing in the theory of reincarnation: that you will be born and the soul is eternal – again a buffer. Or you can think that it is only the body that dies, and what is body? Nothing but bones, marrow, flesh, blood; it is nothing of worth, it is useless, a dirty bag – so let it die. But your pure soul is going to be for ever and ever – a buffer is created.\nThese buffers don’t allow you to see what reality is; they are the way to console yourself. But Confucius believes that consolation is the end: If a man can console himself, he has known the art of life. That’s what Confucius thinks that the whole art of life is: How to live in this miserable world in comparative ease, comparatively not too burdened. Yes, there is misery, but one can protect oneself from misery by creating conceptions, rationalisations. And humanity has been moving from one rationalisation to another, but always it finds a new rationalisation.\nFor example, in the East this rationalisation is very ancient: If you are miserable, they say, you must have done something wrong in the last, in the past, life. Something has gone wrong in your past, you have done some wrong KARMA, hence you are miserable. Now things are explained, so one has to suffer. You have sown, now you are reaping.\nI have heard about a man who was a very good tailor.\nHe was caught stealing and he was sentenced to two years in jail. The Mayor of the town went to see him because he was the best tailor in the town and the whole town was suffering from his absence; and the Mayor was also a lover of this tailor. When he went to see him in this jail, he was doing some needlework, sewing something the old habit – and what else to do? So the Mayor asked ‘So, I see you are sewing something?’\nAnd the tailor said ‘No sir, reaping.’\nThe whole philosophy of KARMA IS that you have sown already, now you are reaping; you have done, so it is a natural consequence. It consolesSo nobody is doing anything unjust to you –\nGod is not unjust, fate is not unjust, the world is not unjust, the society is not unjust it is your own KARMA, so what to do? One has to pass through – it and one has to keep one’s equanimity, one’s equilibrium. And don’t do such a thing again, otherwise in the next life you will suffer again. So that is the only thing that can be done: you cannot change the past, but you can still manage the future... a beautiful consolation.\nIt has helped the East to remain poor, miserable. It has helped the East to remain ugly, ill, unhygienic. It has helped the East to console itself, and that consolation has turned into a tremendous lethargy. There is nothing you can do – you have to tolerate. All that is needed is to beware of the future. So the past has to be accepted and the future has to be feared, that’s all. But even in poverty, in misery, the East seems to be more happy than the West. Why? The East has a beautiful buffer, a strong buffer, to protect itself.\nNow each society has to create these consolations in different ways. Now, in the West psychoanalysis is one of the most consoling processes. You go to the psychoanalyst and he throws the whole responsibility on to your mother; you feel unburdened, you say ‘So what can I do?’ You cannot change your mother the same as you cannot change your past your mother is your past – what can you do? Next time, keep a little more alert! Don’t enter into anybody’s womb, that’s all. This has happened: you were born to such and such a mother and she has spoiled your life, so you are not responsible; you feel good. It is just a calamity that has happened, and whatsoever has happened, has happened; accept it. Long years of psychoanalysis, and they simply prepare you to accept, they simply make you alert that things have been this way and nothing can be done. All their explanations are rationalisations. And they find everything: whatsoever you ask, they have answers for it.\nIf you smoke, they have answers for why you smoke. Your mother must have taken away the breast sooner than you wanted, hence you are smoking. So you are not responsible, what to do? Your mother took away the breast, now the cigar is a substitute breast – and it is, a little. They find very clever explanations! It seems it is a little, because from the breast flows warm milk and from the cigarette flows warm smoke. And there is a certain similarity, and you do hold the cigar in the same way you hold a breast in your mouth.\nBut when it comes to themselves, then it is troublesome. It is said that Freud used to explain everything through sex – whatsoever you would do, he would find a sexual explanation If in your dream you were climbing a mountain, it was sexual: you were climbing a woman. If, in your dream\nyou were driving fast, it was nothing, it was sexual: you wanted to penetrate a woman fast. Every explanation he would find through sex. As in East every explanation was found through the soul and became a very consoling process, so Freud thought of everything through sex.\nBut sometimes he would be in a difficulty: he himself was a chainsmoker so he had to sayOnce\nsomebody asked him ‘What is the meaning of your cigar smoking?’\nHe said ‘Sometimes a cigar may be just a cigar, and nothing but a cigar.’\nOf course the disciple was not satisfied, and the disciple, said to the other disciples ‘That simply shows that it is a rationalisation on the part of Sigmund Freud for his cigar smoking.’\nHe wants to protect himself. Now it will be too much to think that he has some complex behind this smoking. Everybody has a complex, so everybody has to give in to this consolation that because of this complex.But Freud should not have this complex otherwise it will become a disturbing thing to\nhimself that ‘I am the greatest psychoanalyst ever, the founder of psychoanalysis, and I am smoking and I know what it is.’ So he says ‘Sometimes a cigar is a cigar.’\nThis way of explaining things has become very prevalent in the West. It has almost taken very epidemic proportions. Psychoanalysis is always trying to get to the ‘why’ of everything, as if by knowing the ‘why’ anything is solved. Why are you miserable? Go to the psychoanalyst, he will find an answer ‘why’ for it. ‘Your father was such, your mother was such, your childhood was such – that’s why’; and you become happy. You become happy because now you have the rationalisation.\nI have heard the shortest psychiatric joke ever. Listen, it is very small. Be careful! A man asked another man ‘Are you a psychiatrist?’\nAnd the other man said ‘Why do you ask?’ And the man said ‘So, you are a psychiatrist!’\n‘Why’, a continuous ‘why’, as if ‘why’ is going to explain anything. It simply postpones: it pushes the same problem a little further back, but again the ‘why’ can be asked. Hindus say that you did something wrong in the past life. Ask why, then they have to go to another past life. Then ask why, and the MAHATMA will become very angry and he will say, ‘Stop! You are going beyond These are things to be experienced, not to be asked.’ What is the point of saying ‘I have done something wrong in the past life, why? Then something in another life, then why? Why did I do the wrong thing in my first life?’ It is useless. But as in the East religion became a consolation, so it is happening in the West – psychoanalysis is becoming a consolation.\nPsychoanalysis is an almost obsessive compulsion to analyse each and every thing and to find out the cause of it. Particularly in America it has become almost a collective neurosis; everybody is going to the psychoanalyst or the psychiatrist – anybody who can afford it is going. Those who are not going to the psychiatrist are poor people, they cannot afford it. When women meet in their clubs, they talk about their psychiatrist, what he has said and how profound is his analysis. And everything is reduced to the lowest denominator. If you ask the psychoanalyst ‘What is the cause of this lotus?’\nhe will say ‘The mud.’ If you have spiritual experiences, what is the cause? He will go to sex – the mud, the lowest denominator.\nBut things, in a way, help. If you find that all these MAHATMAS who are experiencing SAHASRAR are experiencing nothing but sexuality, sublimated sexuality, you are at ease. So you don’t need to worry about it, you don’t need to be in search of it – this is just sublimated sexuality; you are okay wherever you are. If Buddha attained to bliss, it is nothing but a sexual fantasy; so there is nothing wrong: you can go on reading your PLAYBOY and enjoy your sexual fantasy, because Buddha’s experience was also nothing but a sublimated sexual fantasy. Consolations.…\nI have heard a Second World War story about a priest who repeatedly preached to the troops about predestination.\nThe priest told the soldiers not to worry about their future or fate on the battlefield, because if they were predestined to be killed, a bullet would find its mark no matter where they were; or, on the other hand, if they were to be spared, no bullet would hit them.\nSometime later, in the heat of battle, with bullets spraying around him, the priest hot-footed it to the nearest and biggest tree. A soldier was behind it. He enquired of the priest about his predestination sermons and why he should be seeking shelter now.\n‘You do not fully understand the principles and theories of predestination’ the priest replied. ‘I was predestined to run and hide behind this tree.’\nExplanations and explanations... clever consolations... places to hide.…\nLife has to be faced. It is rough; there is much pain, but the pain has to be faced. There is misery; it has to be encountered, it has to be passed through without any explanations and without any consolations. If you can live your life without any theorisation about it – directly, immediately, moment-to-moment – one day, you will come to that source of joy which is not a consolation, which is a contentment. And what is the difference? Contentment is a positive state of your being, a consolation is just negative. I have one eye, others don’t have even one – I feel consoled. I am miserable, others are even more miserable – I am consoled. I am young, others are old I am consoled. I am old, others have died young – I am consoled.\nConsolations and consolations, but all empty.\nConfucius believes in consolations, Lieh Tzu believes in contentment, and the difference has to be remembered. Contentment comes only when you are not comparing, when you are simply within yourself, totally in yourself – centred, rooted. And by being in your being, you suddenly realise that the whole is yours, and you are of the whole; you are not separate. The ego has disappeared, you have become universal. In that moment, there is great contentment, great benediction. But that benediction, that contentment, does not come through rationalisation; it comes through realisation – that is the difference.\nConsolation is a rationalisation, contentment is a realisation.\nSo there are three states of mind: discontent – a state of comparison; comparing with those who have more than you, then there is discontent. Somebody has a beautiful car and you are walking on foot; you are a pedestrian, then you are discontented. The second stage is contentment – you are a pedestrian and you see a beggar who has no feet: comparing with that one who has less than you, but still comparison. Discontent one aspect of the coin; contentment, the so-called ‘contentment’ – the other aspect of the same coin. And the name of the coin is comparison. When you have thrown the coin completely – contentment and discontent, all – then suddenly you are in a state of no-comparison: that is real contentment. Then you don’t compare who has more, who has less. In fact, then it is not a question of having, then it is a question of being. Having never helps.\nI was reading the other night some very strange statistics which Bill Bright records in his beautiful book, JESUS AND THE INTELLECTUAL:\nIn 1923, a very important meeting was held at the Edgewater Beach Hotel in Chicago. Attending this meeting were nine of the world’s most successful financiers: Charles Schwab, president of the largest independent steel company; Samuel Insull, president of the largest utility company; Howard Hopson, president of the largest gas company; Arthur Cotton, the greatest wheat speculator; Richard Whitney, President of the New York Stock Exchange; Albert Fall, a member of the President’s Cabinet; Leon Fraser, President of the Bank of International Settlements; Jesse Livermore, the greatest ‘bear’ on Wall Street; and Iver Krueger, head of the greatest monopoly.\nTwenty-five years later, Charles Schwab died in bankruptcy, having lived on borrowed money for five years before his death; Samuel Insull had died a fugitive from justice and penniless in a foreign land; Howard Hopson was insane; Arthur Cotton had died abroad, insolvent; Richard Whitney had spent time in Sing Sing. Albert Fall had been pardoned so that he could die at home; Jesse Livermore, Iver Krueger and Leon Fraser had all died by suicide. All of these men had learned well the art of making a living, but none of them had learned how to live.\nYou can have as much as you desire, but by having nobody ever attains to life. Life comes only through being, not through having.\nNow there are three types of people: those who have – the worldly; those who renounce – the other-worldly. The first and the second are not opposite to each other, howsoever opposite they may appear. One believes that by having more you will attain to happiness, the other believes that by not having more you will attain to happiness, but both believe in having. The third – the totally different dimension is of being: neither having nor not having.\nThat’s what I mean by sannyas. Don’t be worldly, don’t be otherworldly. Don’t compare with those who have more, don’t compare with those who have less. Compare not. Just be yourself... allow your being. BE, and that being will bring tremendous joy. And that joy will be one, not many. And that joy will not have any cause to it – it will be uncaused, it will be just like well-being, health.\nI have heard.…\nOnce there was a man, alone and miserable. He prayed to God and said ‘My Lord, send me a beautiful woman, I am very alone, I need company.’\nGod laughed and said ‘Why not a cross?’\nThe man was very angry and said ‘Cross! For what? Do I want to commit suicide? I want only a beautiful woman.’\nSo he got a beautiful woman, but soon he became even more miserable than before. The woman was a constant pain in the neck.\nHe prayed again and said ‘My Lord, send me a sword.’ He was planning to kill the woman and be free of her; he was longing to have the good old days back again.\nBut again God laughed and said ‘What about the cross? Should I send it now?’\nThe man was in a rage and said ‘Don’t you think that this woman was enough of a cross? Please just send me a sword.’\nSo the sword came. He killed the woman and was caught and ordered to be crucified. He prayed to God and laughed loudly and said ‘Forgive me, my Lord, I didn’t listen to you – you were asking to send this cross from the very beginning. Had I listened to you, I would have saved myself so many unnecessary troubles.’\nThe world, the other-world; the householder’s life and the monk’s life... so many troubles. If you listen to Tao, then the message is very simple: Be rooted in your being, and you will be saved from all the troubles, all the troubles that having brings and the troubles that not having brings. You just be.\nBeing is the goal of Tao.\nAnd one thing more to be understood: Being... you already are. There is no becoming; you are not to become – it is already the case, you have it within you. It just has to be allowed to open so that the perfume is released to the winds; and that is the real song, the joy.\nThe man was singing, but the song was just a pretension; it came out of consolation – it was not a true song. The man was playing on an instrument, but it was not true music; because the true music comes only when you are deeply rooted in yourself. Then YOU become the instrument and God plays on it.\nRemember, if you are searching for consolation you will find it, but it is a false coin. Comfortable, convenient, it is like a drug: you start drinking and you remain miserable. The misery does not change, but through drinking you start forgetting about it. Consolation is a sort of intoxication, and nothing is changed because the door to misery remains open – you still go on comparing. Comparison is the root cause of misery. To be non-comparative – to be neither higher nor lower, just to be yourself; not to think in relation to others, just to think in terms of your tremendous aloneness – then you are happy.\nI have heard.…\nShe had one of those one-in-a-million figures. Luscious, well-developed, neat with the perfect contour. But despite all these gifts she developed a neurosis about peeping Toms.\n‘What measures do you take to avoid this calamity?’ asked her psychiatrist.\n‘Well, I keep the shades down, I bar the windows and I always undress behind a screen.’ ‘How do you keep the boys from peeking through the keyhole?’\n‘I leave the door open.’\nCertainly, when you leave the door open nobody can peep through the keyhole; but the door is open, so what is the point? Consolation is like that: the door remains open, because consolation depends on comparison and misery also depends on comparison. So the door is open, but you become more and more intoxicated with consolation, more and more suffocated by your own theorisations, rationalisations; more and more insulated. Hiding behind your buffers, you miss life.\nDrop comparing.\nNow, this parable, read ordinarily, will give you an impression that Lieh Tzu is not saying anything against Confucius. That is their way of saying things; they are very subtle people. He has not uttered a single word against Confucius, and he has demolished the whole Confucian philosophy. So when you are reading these parables, they are not simple parables. Simple they are in a way, but they are very profound. You have to dive deep, you have to dig, you have to go into them and you have to know the difference between discipline and spontaneity.\nWhenever anything is of discipline, Tao is against it. Whenever anything is of spontaneity, Tao is for it. Tao is spontaneity, Tao is suchness, Tao is a tremendous acceptance of whatsoever is. And in that acceptance one flowers.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9258","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/tao_the_pathless_path_vol_1/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/tao_the_pathless_path_vol_1/>Tao.

If you look only on the surface, you will miss the meaning. Taoist
parables are not on the surface. They are very deep, and they have to be
penetrated and looked and meditated upon, then only will you know the
real meaning. On the surface, this parable seems as if it is in favour
of Confucius; on the surface; it seems that the parable is saying that
Confucius is wise. The reality is just the opposite.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a great diametrical opposition between the Taoist attitude
and the Confucian attitude; Confucius is as far away from the Taoist
vision as possible. Confucius believes in law, Confucius</p><p>believes in tradition, Confucius believes in discipline. Confucius
believes in character, morality, culture, society, education. Tao
believes in spontaneity, individuality, freedom. Tao is rebellious;
Confucius is very conformist.</p><p><br></p><p>Taoism is the profoundest non-conformism that has ever been evolved
anywhere in the world, at any time in history; essentially it is
rebellion. So there has been a rebellion and the Taoist mystics, Lao
Tzu, Chuang Tzu and Lieh Tzu, go on ridiculing the Confucian attitude.
This is a parable of ridicule. You will understand it when I explain it
to you. Their ridicule is also very subtle, not gross. First let us

WAIST, SINGING AS HE STRUMMED A LUTE.</p><p><br></p><p>Singing, music, dancing, are the language of joy, of happiness. They
are an expression that the person is not miserable. But it may be just
an appearance, it may be just projected, it may be just cultivated; deep
down the situation may be just the opposite. Sometimes it happens that
you laugh because you don’t want to cry. Sometimes it happens that you
smile because tears are coming and, if you don’t smile, they will start
rolling down your cheeks. Sometimes you maintain an attitude, a
cultivated face, a mask, that you are happy, because what is the point
of showing your unhappiness to the world? That’s why people look so
happy. Everybody thinks he is the unhappiest person in the world.
because he knows his reality and he knows only the faces of others the
cultivated faces. So everybody deep down thinks: ‘I am the most
miserable person, and why am I the most miserable person when everybody
is so happy?’</p><p><br></p><p>Singing, dancing, are certainly a language of joy, but you can learn
the language without knowing what joy is. That’s what humanity has done:
people have learned gestures – empty gestures.</p><p><br></p><p>But Confucius is deceived. He says</p><p><br></p><p>‘MASTER, WHAT IS THE REASON FOR YOUR JOY?’</p><p><br></p><p>The mask has deceived Confucius; the man may be joyful, may not be
joyful. The man has to be looked into directly – through his nature, not
through his expression. The expression can be false: people have learned
expression. Sometimes... do you watch? Somebody is smiling – on the lips
there is a beautiful smile – and look into the eyes, and the eyes say
something just the opposite. Somebody says something to you, ‘I love
you’; and look at the face, and at the eyes, and the very vibe of the
person, and it seems that he hates you. But just to be polite he is
saying ‘I love you’.</p><p><br></p><p>Confucius looked only at the appearance: that is the first thing to
be remembered; and he was deceived – deceived so much that he called the
man ‘Master’.</p><p><br></p><p>He says</p><p><br></p><p>‘MASTER, WHAT IS THE REASON FOR YOUR JOY?’</p><p><br></p><p>Now again, joy has no reason, joy cannot have a reason to it. If joy
has any reason, it is not joy at all: joy can only be without any
reason, uncaused. A disease has a reason, but health? Health</p><p>is natural. If you go and ask the doctor ‘Why am I healthy?’ he
cannot answer you. If you go to the doctor and you say ‘Why am I ill?’
he can answer you, because illness has a cause. He can diagnose your
case, and he can find the reason why you are ill; but nobody has yet
been able to find a reason why man is healthy. Health is natural, health
is as it should be. Illness is as it should not be, illness means
something has gone wrong. When everything is going well, one is healthy.
When everything is in tune, one is healthy. When one is harmonious with
the whole, one is healthy. There is no reason for it.</p><p><br></p><p>But Confucius asked</p><p><br></p><p>‘MASTER, WHAT IS THE REASON FOR OUR JOY?’</p><p><br></p><p>Again Lieh Tzu is joking about Confucius, that’s how they are very
subtle people. He is saying that the whole Confucian wrong attitude is
there in the very question: Confucius thinks there are REASONS for joy.
There cannot be any reasons for joy. Joy simply is – unexplained,
unexplainable. When it is, it is; when it is not, it is not. When it is
not, you can find the reasons why it is not; but when it is, you cannot
find any reasons why it is. And if you can show the reasons why it is,
then your joy is cultivated, not real, not true, not authentic. It is
not flowing from your innermost core; it is just that you are managing
it, you are manipulating it, you are pretending it. When a joy is a
pretended joy, you can find out the reason. But when the joy is truly
there, it is so mysterious, it is so primal, that you cannot find any
reason in it.</p><p><br></p><p>If you ask a Buddha ‘Why are you happy?’ he will shrug his shoulders.
If you ask Lao Tzu ‘Why are you blissful?’ he will say ‘Don’t ask it.
Rather than asking why I am blissful, enquire why you are not.’</p><p><br></p><p>It is like a small spring in the mountains: when there is no
hindrance, the spring flows; when there are rocks on the way, it cannot
flow. When the rocks are removed.<span class=s4></span>You don’t
create the spring –</p><p>you only remove the negative, you only remove the obstacle. The
spring was there, but because of the rock it was not able to flow. When
you remove the rock you are not creating the spring – the spring was
already there. By removing the rock you have removed the negative, the
obstacle, and the spring flows. Now if somebody asks ‘Why does the
spring flow?’ – because the spring is there, that’s why it flows. If it
is not flowing, then there is a cause to it. Let this sink deep in you
because it is your problem too.</p><p><br></p><p>Never ask why you are happy, never ask why one is blissful, otherwise
you have asked a wrong question. Never ask why there is a God. If you
ask, you have asked a wrong question; and all the answers that can be
given are bound to be wrong, because a wrong question provokes wrong
answers. ‘Why is God?’ – that is irrelevant; it is simply the case.</p><p><br></p><p>Confucius is asking something, and by asking that, he is showing his
presuppositions: Confucius believes that everything has a cause. If
everything has a cause, then only science can exist. Then there is no
possibility for religion, because science is the enquiry into the
cause-and-effect relationship, an enquiry into causation, an enquiry
into causality. That is the whole scientific attitude: they say that if
something is there, there must be a cause to it you may know, you may
not know but the cause is bound to be there. ‘If we don’t know today, we
will know tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, but the cause is bound to
be known, because the cause must be there.’ This is the scientific
attitude: everything can be reduced to its cause.</p><p>And what is the religious attitude? Religion says that nothing can
really be reduced to its cause. That which can be reduced is not
essential. The essential simply is – it exists without any cause; it is
mysterious. This is the meaning of mystery: there is no cause to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Confucius is asking a question according to his presuppositions,
according to his philosophy, ‘MASTER, WHAT IS THE REASON FOR YOUR
JOY?’</p><p>Why is he asking? – so that, if the reason is known, others can also
cultivate it. If somebody says ‘By standing on my head I become very
peaceful’, you also stand on your head, and you become peaceful.
Somebody says ‘I am happy because I have renounced the world’. so you
also renounce the world, and you become happy. Then happiness becomes
something that can be manipulated. This is how people are – imitating
each other.</p><p><br></p><p>And in fact there is no cause for happiness. The day you understand
this, you can be happy any moment. If there is a cause, then the cause
will take time: you will have to practise it, you will have to practise
long. And the whole radical attitude of Tao is that you can be happy
THIS moment.</p><p><br></p><p>What does this mean? This means that there is no cause, so there is
no need to practise. It is just a question of allowing it – is is
already there if you ALLOW. If you don’t allow, you function like a
rock: if you allow, the rock is removed. It is only a question of
allowing it. God is there, you allow – that’s all. If you don’t allow,
he will not enter because he cannot destroy your freedom, he protects
your freedom. If you say ‘no’, he is not going to enter into your being.
If on your door it is written that nobody is allowed without permission,
he will wait. He is not even going to ask your permission – he will
simply wait, because even to ask your permission is to interfere with
your freedom. He will wait. He will not ring the bell. he will simply
wait. God is everywhere, waiting, and he waits so silently... that’s why
his presence is not felt, he looks almost absent. Can’t you see it? God
seems to be the most absent thing in the world. That’s why atheists can
exist, and they can say ‘Where is your God? We don’t see.…’ He is so
non-interfering; he allows you total freedom. And total freedom implies
in it to go against God.</p><p><br></p><p>Your nature is that of bliss. You are made of the stuff called bliss.
But you have to allow it, you have to relax, you have to be in a let-go;
no cause is there – just let-go is needed. Hence, theoretically, it can
happen at this very moment – not even a split second has to be wasted.
If there is a cause, then... then a long time will be needed, and even
then one never knows – you may succeed, you may not succeed.</p><p><br></p><p>See the difference between the Hindu attitude and the Taoist
attitude. The Hindu, the Jain, the Buddhist – they all say: Past lives,
KARMA, has to be removed. Much has to be done, great discipline is
needed – only then will you be able to attain. Ashtavakra, Lao Tzu,
Bodhidharma, Lin Chi say: Nothing is needed, just allow it. Relax, allow
it, and this very moment it will start pouring in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Confucius says</p><p><br></p><p>‘MASTER, WHAT IS THE REASON FOR YOUR JOY?’</p><p>‘Tell me how you have attained it. Tell me what was your process –
what methodology you followed; what principles, what disciplines, what
scriptures. How have you attained it?’ Now Confucius is greedy. He wants
to attain to the same state where song is natural, and music flows, and
one is celebrating. He is tremendously enchanted by this man because he
is</p><p><br></p><p>... IN A ROUGH FUR COAT WITH A ROPE ROUND HIS WAIST, SINGING AS HE
STRUMMED A LUTE.</p><p><br></p><p>A poor man has nothing to be happy for, has nothing to be happy
about. If he were miserable, it would be understandable; if he were
depressed, it would be understandable – Confucius would have passed by
him, not even noticing his existence. But this poor man who has
nothing,‘a rope round his waist’... singing? Singing a song of joy?
Strumming a lute? Confucius is enchanted, magnetised, but he asks a
wrong question.</p><p><br></p><p>A Taoist will never ask such a question. Joy is, and SIMPLY is; it
has no cause to it, hence no methods are possible, only
understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>That man said</p><p><br></p><p>‘I HAV MANY JOYS.’</p><p><br></p><p>If you have many joys, you have not understood what joy is, because
joy is only one. There cannot be many joys. There can be many diseases,
but there cannot be many ‘healths’. You may have your disease, I may
have mine, somebody else has his own; but when I am healthy, you are
healthy, somebody else is healthy – what is the difference? Can you make
a distinction between my health and your health? There is no possibility
of it: health is universal, disease is personal. Disease is of the ego,
health is not of the ego. Disease is of the body, of the mind; health is
of the beyond, and the beyond is one. My body differs from yours –
naturally I will have a different disease, you will have a different
disease, but health? Health is simply one. It has the taste, the same
taste always, eternally the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody asked Buddha ‘What is the taste of your Buddhahood?’ He said
‘Go and taste the sea, and taste it from anywhere – from this bank, from
any bank of any beach. Or go to the middle of the ocean and taste it
there, or go to the other shore – and you will find the taste always the
same: the same salty taste. Buddhahood has one taste.’ Whosoever has
become a Buddha has come to the same taste. Health has the same taste.
When the child is healthy, the young man is healthy, and the old man is
healthy, then too it has the same taste. When the woman is healthy, the
man is healthy – the same taste.</p><p><br></p><p>But diseases are different. Now, medical science says that even when
two persons are suffering from the same disease, even then the two
diseases are not the same. Hence sometimes it happens that you are
suffering from some disease – maybe tuberculosis – and your wife is
suffering from the same disease, tuberculosis, but the same medicines
don’t work. You need one medicine, your wife needs some other medicine.
That’s why the physician is needed; otherwise the chemist would be
enough. If once it was decided that tuberculosis needed this medicine,
then what would be the point in going to the physician? The chemist
could supply it.</p><p>Now, more and more, as medical science is going deeper into the
phenomena of health and disease, they are becoming aware that each
disease has a personality in it: it belongs to the person. So now they
say: Don’t treat the disease, treat the person. Don’t be too much
concerned with the disease. Look into the person. his total personality,
his way of life, his attitudes, his habit patterns. Look into them, and
then you will find that the name TB may be the same – because it would
be very difficult to have separate names for everybody – but each person
who suffers from tuberculosis suffers differently, and a different
treatment is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Diseases are personal, but health? Health is impersonal, universal.
So is joy. Misery is a disease; joy is health, well-being. Now Confucius
has asked a wrong question, and provoked a wrong answer. And, of course,
the man does not know anything about joy.</p><p><br></p><p>He says</p><p><br></p><p>‘I HAVE MANY JOYS.’</p><p><br></p><p>Many? Then something has gone wrong. Joy is one. When you say you
have many joys, you don’t know what joy is. You may be talking about
pleasures, you may be talking about your so-called ‘moments of
happiness’ which are not really moments of happiness but only of less
misery. A person is very miserable, then one day he feels less miserable
and he says</p><p><br></p><p>‘I am very happy.’ That is just relative; he does not know what
happiness is.</p><p><br></p><p>He only knows sometimes very intense misery, sometimes not so
intense. When it is not so intense, he says ‘I am happy.’ You can
observe it in yourself. Have you ever known what happiness is? Do you
know the taste of it? You have known only different stages of
misery.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes the misery is so much that it is unbearable. Sometimes it
is bearable, within control – you can tolerate it. You move from less
misery to more misery, from more misery to less misery. But you have not
known what happiness is, because once you have known what happiness is,
then there is no need to be miserable at all – because then you have the
key. You can open that door any moment you decide to open it. But you
cannot open the door of happiness – that simply shows that you don’t
have the key. You just know relative states of the same phenomenon:
sometimes it is very dark and you cannot see at all, and sometimes it is
not so dark, it is dim; but you have not known what light is. Light is
not any relative state of darkness – light is not less darkness,
remember light is a totally different kind of energy; it has nothing to
do with darkness. Darkness and light cannot exist together in the same
room. Light is a positivity, darkness is a negativity – so is
misery.</p><p><br></p><p>Said the man</p><p><br></p><p>‘I HAVE MANY JOYS. OF THE MYRIAD THINGS WHICH HEAVEN BEGOT, MANKIND
IS THE MOST NOBLE – AND I HAVE THE LUCK TO BE HUMAN. THIS IS MY FIRST
JOY.’</p><p><br></p><p>On the surface, it looks very meaningful, appealing, because very
much fulfilling to the human ego. Man has always been thinking of
himself as the superiormost creation of God. Man has always thought of
himself only as NEXT to God, and feels very happy. But how is happiness
possible through the ego? Unhappiness comes through the ego. And this is
one of the greatest points of the</p><p>egoist: that man!s only next to God. That, too, we say only just to
be polite; deep down you know that God is next to you.</p><p><br></p><p>The very idea of ‘I’ has in it an implication of being the first, and
then everything is secondary. Friedrich Nietzsche is truer than many
other people, he says: I cannot allow God to exist because then I am
secondary, and I cannot be secondary; I cannot accept my status as
secondary. If God is, then I will always be secondary. Howsoever I grow,
and wherever I reach, I will be secondary – I will never be primary, the
first. This is not acceptable, so he says: God is dead and man is free.
God is the bondage. He is true – in a way. ‘In a way’ I say, because
that’s how everybody thinks deep down: every ego wants God to be
second.</p><p><br></p><p>Even when you are a great worshipper, a great so-called ‘religious’
person, every moment you are trying to manipulate God according to you.
‘Do my will!’ That’s all that your prayer means: ‘Do according to me.
Listen to me.’ Your whole effort is to convert God into your servant.
You call him ‘Lord’, ‘Master’, but those are just briberies; you are
trying to manipulate him. You say ‘I am nobody, you are all’; but deep
down you know who is who. In fact, even when you fight for your God, it
is YOUR God. Even when you sacrifice yourself on some pedestal, on some
altar, it is to your God that you sacrifice. When you bow down to an
image of God in a temple, in a mosque, in a church, it is to your image
that you have created, it is to your God. You are bowing down in front
of your own creation. You are bowing down as if before a mirror. You are
reflected there and you say ‘How beautiful!’ When a Christian says ‘How
beautiful Christ is’, when a Hindu says ‘How beautiful Krishna is’, and
when a Buddhist says ‘How beautiful Buddha is’ – the Buddhist will not
accept that Christ is beautiful because that does not fulfil his ego.
The Christian will not accept that Buddha is beautiful – that does not
fulfil his ego. The Hindu cannot believe that Christ or Mohammed or
Moses are beautiful – that does not fulfil his ego.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember: we are fulfilling our egos in every way possible – gross or
subtle, direct or indirect. And a religious person is one who knows
this, becomes aware of this, and in that awareness the ego
disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>A religious person has no idea of who is superior. A religious person
cannot say ‘I am superior to the tree, I am superior to the animal, I am
superior to the bird.’ A religious person cannot say ‘I am superior.’ A
religious person has come to know ‘I am not’, and in that experience of
‘I am not’, joy flows in; the rock has been removed.</p><p><br></p><p>Now this man says</p><p><br></p><p>‘I HAVE MANY JOYS. OF THE MYRIAD THINGS WHICH HEAVEN BEGOT, MANKIND
IS THE MOST NOBLE...’</p><p><br></p><p>Why? Why is mankind the most noble? If we look at human history,
mankind seems to be the most ignoble. Look at the animals: they have not
been so violent, so murderous; they have not been so insane. Have you
ever seen any animal turning into a politician... trying to become the
president of a country? They are not insane: they live naturally. they
die naturally. Animals in the wild never go mad. Sometimes they go mad
when they are forced to live in a zoo – the zoo is a human creation.
Animals never commit suicide, but sometimes in the zoo they commit.
Animals never turn homosexual in the natural wild state, but in the zoo
they turn. In the zoo they become murderous?</p><p>dangerous. Yes, they kill, but they kill only when they want to eat.
Man kills for no reason. A man goes to the wild and kills a tiger and he
says ‘This is play. This is game. I was hunting.’ Have you ever heard of
any lion HUNTING? They never hunt. When a lion is hungry, of course he
kills, and that’s a natural way for him.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard.…</p><p><br></p><p>Once a lion and a fox entered a restaurant – maybe Vrindavan. They
took seats and the fox ordered, but the fox ordered only for one. So the
waiter asked ‘And what about your friend?’</p><p><br></p><p>And the fox said ‘What do you think? If he was hungry, should I be
sitting here?’</p><p><br></p><p>He is not hungry – that is certain. When animals are hungry they
kill, but they don’t kill as game, they don’t kill for fun; they are not
interested in killing in itself. Of course they are interested in food –
nothing is wrong in it; man kills for no reason. Animals don’t kill for
ideologies: they don’t say ‘I am a Communist and you are a capitalist. I
will kill you.’ They don’t say ‘I am a Fascist and you are a Communist
sol will kill you.’ They don’t have any ideologies, and they don’t kill
because they are Christians, Hindus and Mohammedans.</p><p><br></p><p>Man kills for any excuse, for any excuse whatsoever. Hindus can kill
Mohammedans, Mohammedans can kill Hindus, Christians can kill
Mohammedans, and Buddhists... and so on and so forth. And for what? For
abstract doctrines, principles – and nobody is ready to live for those
doctrines and everybody is ready to kill others for those same
doctrines. If somebody insults the Bible, the Christian is ready to kill
you, and if you ask him ‘Are you living your Bible?’ he will say ‘It is
very difficult.’ He is not interested in living it, nobody is interested
in living it; but if it comes to killing, then everybody becomes very
much interested:</p><p><br></p><p>Down the centuries, in three thousand years, there have been five
thousand wars. No, no animal is so ignoble – animals have a natural
nobility. Man is very cunning.</p><p><br></p><p>But the man said</p><p><br></p><p>‘... MANKIND IS THE MOST NOBLE – AND I HAVE THE LUCK TO BE HUMAN.
THIS IS MY FIRST JOY.’</p><p><br></p><p>This is not joy. This is the pleasure that comes from feeling
egoistic, that ‘I am somebody’. And remember, this cannot lead you to
real happiness, because deep down there is comparison. If you are
feeling superior, at any moment you can feel inferior.</p><p><br></p><p>Once I heard a religious man, a saint, a very well known saint in
India, teaching his disciples: ‘Always look to people who don’t have as
much as you have, and you will feel very happy. If you have a house,
always look to people who don’t have a house.’ Naturally, you will feel
happy. ‘If you have only one eye, look at the person who is blind... you
will feel happy.’ But what type of happiness is this? And what type of
religion is this? And naturally you cannot throw away the other aspect
Or the coin. You have one eye – when you look at the blind person you
feel happy. But when you come across a man who has two beautiful eyes,
then what will you do? You will feel unhappy.</p><p><br></p><p>In your so-called ‘happiness’ unhappiness is implied.</p><p>No, through comparison nobody comes to joy. Joy is a non-comparative
state. Don’t compare. I have heard...</p><p>Father took Sonny to see a show which featured fifty of the most
naked performers in the country.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Phew! Phew! Phew!’ Father kept muttering all during the performance.
‘What’s the matter, Pop, don’t you like the show?’ Sonny asked.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Sure I do’ he replied ‘I was thinking of your mother.’</p><p><br></p><p>If you are comparing, your comparison is going to create trouble.
Remember: joy is not out of comparison – never.</p><p><br></p><p>But this man said</p><p><br></p><p>‘I HAVE MANY JOYS. OF THE MYRIAD THINGS WHICH HEAVEN BEGOT, MANKIND
IS THE MOST NOBLE – AND I HAVE THE LUCK TO BE HUMAN. THIS IS MY FIRST
JOY.’</p><p><br></p><p>This is not much of a joy. It is just a titillation of the ego: you
feel good, you feel superior. But a person who needs to be superior to
feel good is a person who is carrying a volcano within him. A person who
has to be superior to feel happy is suffering deep down from an
inferiority complex. Only an inferior person thinks in terms of
superiority. A real person, an authentic person. is neither superior nor
inferior. He simply IS – unique; nobody is lower than him and nobody is
higher than him.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole existence is equal. The trees and the rocks, and the
animals and the birds, and men and women, and God – all are sharing the
whole existence on equal terms. The moment you see this tremendous
equality, this oneness, you are joyful. And then your joy has no cause.
it is uncaused.</p><p><br></p><p>‘PEOPLE ARE BORN WHO DO NOT LIVE A DAY OR A MONTH, WHO NEVER GET OUT
OF THEIR SWADDLING CLOTHES. BUT I HAVE ALREADY LIVED TO NINETY. THIS IS
MY JOY.’</p><p><br></p><p>Comparing... somebody was born and died, somebody was young and died,
and this man is comparing: ‘I am ninety years of age, I have lived my
life, so what is there to be miserable about? I am happy, I have lived
more than others.’ But if those others had not died, then...? If he were
alone in the world, then would this man be happy? Just think. The whole
world disappears, only this man is left. There are no animals, no birds,
no rocks – he cannot compare himself, and he cannot call himself ‘the
superior man’. There are no young people dying, no children dying – he
cannot compare himself, that he has lived ninety years of age. If he is
left alone, will he be happy? All his happiness will disappear because
it was coming from comparisons.</p><p><br></p><p>Tao says: If you are alone, absolutely alone, and your happiness
still remains the same, then you have attained – otherwise you have not
attained.</p><p><br></p><p>A comparative happiness is a pseudo happiness. ‘I have a big car and
you don’t have. Because you don’t have, I am happy.’ This is something
foolish. How can I be happy because you don’t have a</p><p>car? What has it to do with my happiness that you don’t have a car?
‘I have a big house and you don’t have a big house, so I am happy.’ This
happiness seems more interested in making others unhappy rather than in
being happy oneself. ‘You don’t have a car, you don’t have a good house
– I am happy because you are miserable.’ Look at the logic of it, the
mathematics is simple: ‘I am happy when people are miserable, so if
people are more miserable, I will be more happy; if the whole world is
turned into hell, I will be supremely happy.’ This is the logic, and
this is what man has been doing.</p><p><br></p><p>In Calcutta, I used to stay in a house, the most beautiful house in
Calcutta. And the man was really in mad love with his house. It was a
marble mansion, really beautiful, built with taste, with very
aristocratic taste, and in Calcutta to have ten acres of garden in the
middle of Calcutta was something impossible – and he had it. He was
really in deep love with it, and whenever I stayed with him, he would
take me to the swimming pool, to the garden, to the lawn; he would show
me this and that – what improvements he had made since I had last been
there. But the last time I went he was very miserable. I said ‘What is
the matter? You have not taken me anywhere. Have you not done anything
new?’</p><p><br></p><p>He said ‘My interest is gone. Can’t you see that by the side, my
neighbour has made a better house? And unless I can make a bigger house
than this, I will remain unhappy.’</p><p><br></p><p>Now this man had the same house, but his happiness had
disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>‘What has your happiness to do with your neighbour? If he has made a
bigger house, how does this concern you? And your house remains the
same! And you are no more happy. Then certainly’ I told him ‘then one
thing is certain, that it was not your house that you were happy with.
You were happy because of the neighbour’s poor house.’</p><p><br></p><p>Watch. Always watch. This is violence to be happy when somebody is
miserable. This is how people start moving in the wrong direction –
become oppressors, become exploiters, become dangerous. They are a curse
on the earth. But their whole logic is the same.</p><p><br></p><p>What this man is saying is: ‘I am happier than others. Look: many
people have died when they were young, and I am still alive, healthy,
and I am ninety years of age. This is my joy.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘FOR ALL MEN, POVERTY IS THE NORM AND DEATH IS THE END. ABIDING BY
THE NORM, AWAITING MY END, WHAT IS THERE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT?’</p><p><br></p><p>Now he says ‘Almost all men are poor, so that is the norm – to be
poor; and naturally everybody is going to die, sol am going to die. I am
poor, I am going to die, everybody is going to die, everybody else is
poor, so why be miserable? That’s why I am happy.’</p><p><br></p><p>This is not happiness.</p><p><br></p><p>‘GOOD!’ SAID CONFUCIUS...</p><p><br></p><p>Confucius was very much impressed, he said</p><p><br></p><p>‘GOOD!... HERE IS A MAN WHO KNOWS HOW TO CONSOLE HIMSELF.’</p><p>But in this sentence, Lieh Tzu has played the trick. He says that
Confucius was very much impressed. He said</p><p><br></p><p>‘GOOD!... HERE IS A MAN WHO KNOWS HOW TO CONSOLE HIMSELF’.</p><p><br></p><p>... because for Confucius, to be satisfied in life is the goal, to
have consolation is the goal. To ask for more, Confucius says, is to ask
for the impossible. This is all that a man can have, and this man knows
the way to console himself, and he is happy and he is singing.</p><p><br></p><p>But to the Taoist, consolation is negative – it is not contentment.
Contentment has nothing to do with consolation; contentment is a totally
different dimension. Try to understand it: consolation means somehow
rationalising one’s situation – trying not to be worried, trying not to
be too much concerned – creating buffers around one. That’s what
Gurdjieff used to call ‘buffers’; everybody creates buffers around
himself so that life is not so shocking.</p><p><br></p><p>They use buffers in the railway trains or springs in the cars, so
that when you are moving on a hilly road – and life is a hilly track –
you don’t go on bumping. Those springs function as buffers. If the road
is rough, the roughness is absorbed by the springs, by the buffers – it
does not reach you.</p><p><br></p><p>So-called ‘philosophies of consolation’ are buffers. You see that you
are poor; a great unhappiness arises in you – create the buffer: ‘So
many people are poor, millions of people are poor, so why be worried
about it? This is how things are.’ You have created a buffer. You are
ill; misery arises – go to the hospital, visit there and see people, and
you will feel very happy. You have created a buffer: at least you are
not as ill as others are. You have lost one leg – just go on the street
and see a beggar who has lost both legs; feel consoled.</p><p><br></p><p>These are buffers: Always look to those who don’t even have as much
as you have. That way life becomes less shocking, you live more
conveniently, more comfortably, and you are not touched. By and by,
between you and life there is such a distance created by the buffers
that nothing ever reaches you. You live encapsulated inside your
buffers, philosophies, consolations. Life ends one day – you can console
yourself: Everybody has to die, it is nothing special happening to you,
God is not especially unkind to you, it happens to everybody. Or you can
start believing in the theory of reincarnation: that you will be born
and the soul is eternal – again a buffer. Or you can think that it is
only the body that dies, and what is body? Nothing but bones, marrow,
flesh, blood; it is nothing of worth, it is useless, a dirty bag – so
let it die. But your pure soul is going to be for ever and ever – a
buffer is created.</p><p><br></p><p>These buffers don’t allow you to see what reality is; they are the
way to console yourself. But Confucius believes that consolation is the
end: If a man can console himself, he has known the art of life. That’s
what Confucius thinks that the whole art of life is: How to live in this
miserable world in comparative ease, comparatively not too burdened.
Yes, there is misery, but one can protect oneself from misery by
creating conceptions, rationalisations. And humanity has been moving
from one rationalisation to another, but always it finds a new
rationalisation.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, in the East this rationalisation is very ancient: If you
are miserable, they say, you must have done something wrong in the last,
in the past, life. Something has gone wrong in your past, you have done
some wrong KARMA, hence you are miserable. Now things are explained, so
one has to suffer. You have sown, now you are reaping.</p><p>I have heard about a man who was a very good tailor.</p><p><br></p><p>He was caught stealing and he was sentenced to two years in jail. The
Mayor of the town went to see him because he was the best tailor in the
town and the whole town was suffering from his absence; and the Mayor
was also a lover of this tailor. When he went to see him in this jail,
he was doing some needlework, sewing something the old habit – and what
else to do? So the Mayor asked ‘So, I see you are sewing something?’</p><p><br></p><p>And the tailor said ‘No sir, reaping.’</p><p><br></p><p>The whole philosophy of KARMA IS that you have sown already, now you
are reaping; you have done, so it is a natural consequence. It
consoles<span class=s4></span>So nobody is doing anything unjust to
you –</p><p>God is not unjust, fate is not unjust, the world is not unjust, the
society is not unjust it is your own KARMA, so what to do? One has to
pass through – it and one has to keep one’s equanimity, one’s
equilibrium. And don’t do such a thing again, otherwise in the next life
you will suffer again. So that is the only thing that can be done: you
cannot change the past, but you can still manage the future... a
beautiful consolation.</p><p><br></p><p>It has helped the East to remain poor, miserable. It has helped the
East to remain ugly, ill, unhygienic. It has helped the East to console
itself, and that consolation has turned into a tremendous lethargy.
There is nothing you can do – you have to tolerate. All that is needed
is to beware of the future. So the past has to be accepted and the
future has to be feared, that’s all. But even in poverty, in misery, the
East seems to be more happy than the West. Why? The East has a beautiful
buffer, a strong buffer, to protect itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Now each society has to create these consolations in different ways.
Now, in the West psychoanalysis is one of the most consoling processes.
You go to the psychoanalyst and he throws the whole responsibility on to
your mother; you feel unburdened, you say ‘So what can I do?’ You cannot
change your mother the same as you cannot change your past your mother
is your past – what can you do? Next time, keep a little more alert!
Don’t enter into anybody’s womb, that’s all. This has happened: you were
born to such and such a mother and she has spoiled your life, so you are
not responsible; you feel good. It is just a calamity that has happened,
and whatsoever has happened, has happened; accept it. Long years of
psychoanalysis, and they simply prepare you to accept, they simply make
you alert that things have been this way and nothing can be done. All
their explanations are rationalisations. And they find everything:
whatsoever you ask, they have answers for it.</p><p><br></p><p>If you smoke, they have answers for why you smoke. Your mother must
have taken away the breast sooner than you wanted, hence you are
smoking. So you are not responsible, what to do? Your mother took away
the breast, now the cigar is a substitute breast – and it is, a little.
They find very clever explanations! It seems it is a little, because
from the breast flows warm milk and from the cigarette flows warm smoke.
And there is a certain similarity, and you do hold the cigar in the same
way you hold a breast in your mouth.</p><p><br></p><p>But when it comes to themselves, then it is troublesome. It is said
that Freud used to explain everything through sex – whatsoever you would
do, he would find a sexual explanation If in your dream you were
climbing a mountain, it was sexual: you were climbing a woman. If, in
your dream</p><p>you were driving fast, it was nothing, it was sexual: you wanted to
penetrate a woman fast. Every explanation he would find through sex. As
in East every explanation was found through the soul and became a very
consoling process, so Freud thought of everything through sex.</p><p><br></p><p>But sometimes he would be in a difficulty: he himself was a
chainsmoker so he had to say<span class=s4></span>Once</p><p>somebody asked him ‘What is the meaning of your cigar smoking?’</p><p><br></p><p>He said ‘Sometimes a cigar may be just a cigar, and nothing but a
cigar.’</p><p><br></p><p>Of course the disciple was not satisfied, and the disciple, said to
the other disciples ‘That simply shows that it is a rationalisation on
the part of Sigmund Freud for his cigar smoking.’</p><p><br></p><p>He wants to protect himself. Now it will be too much to think that he
has some complex behind this smoking. Everybody has a complex, so
everybody has to give in to this consolation that because of this
complex.<span class=s4></span>But Freud should not have this complex
otherwise it will become a disturbing thing to</p><p>himself that ‘I am the greatest psychoanalyst ever, the founder of
psychoanalysis, and I am smoking and I know what it is.’ So he says
‘Sometimes a cigar is a cigar.’</p><p><br></p><p>This way of explaining things has become very prevalent in the West.
It has almost taken very epidemic proportions. Psychoanalysis is always
trying to get to the ‘why’ of everything, as if by knowing the ‘why’
anything is solved. Why are you miserable? Go to the psychoanalyst, he
will find an answer ‘why’ for it. ‘Your father was such, your mother was
such, your childhood was such – that’s why’; and you become happy. You
become happy because now you have the rationalisation.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard the shortest psychiatric joke ever. Listen, it is very
small. Be careful! A man asked another man ‘Are you a psychiatrist?’</p><p>And the other man said ‘Why do you ask?’ And the man said ‘So, you
are a psychiatrist!’</p><p>‘Why’, a continuous ‘why’, as if ‘why’ is going to explain anything.
It simply postpones: it pushes the same problem a little further back,
but again the ‘why’ can be asked. Hindus say that you did something
wrong in the past life. Ask why, then they have to go to another past
life. Then ask why, and the MAHATMA will become very angry and he will
say, ‘Stop! You are going beyond These are things to be experienced, not
to be asked.’ What is the point of saying ‘I have done something wrong
in the past life, why? Then something in another life, then why? Why did
I do the wrong thing in my first life?’ It is useless. But as in the
East religion became a consolation, so it is happening in the West –
psychoanalysis is becoming a consolation.</p><p><br></p><p>Psychoanalysis is an almost obsessive compulsion to analyse each and
every thing and to find out the cause of it. Particularly in America it
has become almost a collective neurosis; everybody is going to the
psychoanalyst or the psychiatrist – anybody who can afford it is going.
Those who are not going to the psychiatrist are poor people, they cannot
afford it. When women meet in their clubs, they talk about their
psychiatrist, what he has said and how profound is his analysis. And
everything is reduced to the lowest denominator. If you ask the
psychoanalyst ‘What is the cause of this lotus?’</p><p>he will say ‘The mud.’ If you have spiritual experiences, what is the
cause? He will go to sex – the mud, the lowest denominator.</p><p><br></p><p>But things, in a way, help. If you find that all these MAHATMAS who
are experiencing SAHASRAR are experiencing nothing but sexuality,
sublimated sexuality, you are at ease. So you don’t need to worry about
it, you don’t need to be in search of it – this is just sublimated
sexuality; you are okay wherever you are. If Buddha attained to bliss,
it is nothing but a sexual fantasy; so there is nothing wrong: you can
go on reading your PLAYBOY and enjoy your sexual fantasy, because
Buddha’s experience was also nothing but a sublimated sexual fantasy.
Consolations.…</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard a Second World War story about a priest who repeatedly
preached to the troops about predestination.</p><p><br></p><p>The priest told the soldiers not to worry about their future or fate
on the battlefield, because if they were predestined to be killed, a
bullet would find its mark no matter where they were; or, on the other
hand, if they were to be spared, no bullet would hit them.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometime later, in the heat of battle, with bullets spraying around
him, the priest hot-footed it to the nearest and biggest tree. A soldier
was behind it. He enquired of the priest about his predestination
sermons and why he should be seeking shelter now.</p><p><br></p><p>‘You do not fully understand the principles and theories of
predestination’ the priest replied. ‘I was predestined to run and hide
behind this tree.’</p><p><br></p><p>Explanations and explanations... clever consolations... places to
hide.…</p><p><br></p><p>Life has to be faced. It is rough; there is much pain, but the pain
has to be faced. There is misery; it has to be encountered, it has to be
passed through without any explanations and without any consolations. If
you can live your life without any theorisation about it – directly,
immediately, moment-to-moment – one day, you will come to that source of
joy which is not a consolation, which is a contentment. And what is the
difference? Contentment is a positive state of your being, a consolation
is just negative. I have one eye, others don’t have even one – I feel
consoled. I am miserable, others are even more miserable – I am
consoled. I am young, others are old I am consoled. I am old, others
have died young – I am consoled.</p><p><br></p><p>Consolations and consolations, but all empty.</p><p><br></p><p>Confucius believes in consolations, Lieh Tzu believes in contentment,
and the difference has to be remembered. Contentment comes only when you
are not comparing, when you are simply within yourself, totally in
yourself – centred, rooted. And by being in your being, you suddenly
realise that the whole is yours, and you are of the whole; you are not
separate. The ego has disappeared, you have become universal. In that
moment, there is great contentment, great benediction. But that
benediction, that contentment, does not come through rationalisation; it
comes through realisation – that is the difference.</p><p><br></p><p>Consolation is a rationalisation, contentment is a realisation.</p><p>So there are three states of mind: discontent – a state of
comparison; comparing with those who have more than you, then there is
discontent. Somebody has a beautiful car and you are walking on foot;
you are a pedestrian, then you are discontented. The second stage is
contentment – you are a pedestrian and you see a beggar who has no feet:
comparing with that one who has less than you, but still comparison.
Discontent one aspect of the coin; contentment, the so-called
‘contentment’ – the other aspect of the same coin. And the name of the
coin is comparison. When you have thrown the coin completely –
contentment and discontent, all – then suddenly you are in a state of
no-comparison: that is real contentment. Then you don’t compare who has
more, who has less. In fact, then it is not a question of having, then
it is a question of being. Having never helps.</p><p><br></p><p>I was reading the other night some very strange statistics which Bill
Bright records in his beautiful book, JESUS AND THE INTELLECTUAL:</p><p><br></p><p>In 1923, a very important meeting was held at the Edgewater Beach
Hotel in Chicago. Attending this meeting were nine of the world’s most
successful financiers: Charles Schwab, president of the largest
independent steel company; Samuel Insull, president of the largest
utility company; Howard Hopson, president of the largest gas company;
Arthur Cotton, the greatest wheat speculator; Richard Whitney, President
of the New York Stock Exchange; Albert Fall, a member of the President’s
Cabinet; Leon Fraser, President of the Bank of International
Settlements; Jesse Livermore, the greatest ‘bear’ on Wall Street; and
Iver Krueger, head of the greatest monopoly.</p><p><br></p><p>Twenty-five years later, Charles Schwab died in bankruptcy, having
lived on borrowed money for five years before his death; Samuel Insull
had died a fugitive from justice and penniless in a foreign land; Howard
Hopson was insane; Arthur Cotton had died abroad, insolvent; Richard
Whitney had spent time in Sing Sing. Albert Fall had been pardoned so
that he could die at home; Jesse Livermore, Iver Krueger and Leon Fraser
had all died by suicide. All of these men had learned well the art of
making a living, but none of them had learned how to live.</p><p><br></p><p>You can have as much as you desire, but by having nobody ever attains
to life. Life comes only through being, not through having.</p><p><br></p><p>Now there are three types of people: those who have – the worldly;
those who renounce – the other-worldly. The first and the second are not
opposite to each other, howsoever opposite they may appear. One believes
that by having more you will attain to happiness, the other believes
that by not having more you will attain to happiness, but both believe
in having. The third – the totally different dimension is of being:
neither having nor not having.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what I mean by sannyas. Don’t be worldly, don’t be
otherworldly. Don’t compare with those who have more, don’t compare with
those who have less. Compare not. Just be yourself... allow your being.
BE, and that being will bring tremendous joy. And that joy will be one,
not many. And that joy will not have any cause to it – it will be
uncaused, it will be just like well-being, health.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard.…</p><p><br></p><p>Once there was a man, alone and miserable. He prayed to God and said
‘My Lord, send me a beautiful woman, I am very alone, I need
company.’</p><p><br></p><p>God laughed and said ‘Why not a cross?’</p><p>The man was very angry and said ‘Cross! For what? Do I want to commit
suicide? I want only a beautiful woman.’</p><p><br></p><p>So he got a beautiful woman, but soon he became even more miserable
than before. The woman was a constant pain in the neck.</p><p><br></p><p>He prayed again and said ‘My Lord, send me a sword.’ He was planning
to kill the woman and be free of her; he was longing to have the good
old days back again.</p><p><br></p><p>But again God laughed and said ‘What about the cross? Should I send
it now?’</p><p><br></p><p>The man was in a rage and said ‘Don’t you think that this woman was
enough of a cross? Please just send me a sword.’</p><p><br></p><p>So the sword came. He killed the woman and was caught and ordered to
be crucified. He prayed to God and laughed loudly and said ‘Forgive me,
my Lord, I didn’t listen to you – you were asking to send this cross
from the very beginning. Had I listened to you, I would have saved
myself so many unnecessary troubles.’</p><p><br></p><p>The world, the other-world; the householder’s life and the monk’s
life... so many troubles. If you listen to Tao, then the message is very
simple: Be rooted in your being, and you will be saved from all the
troubles, all the troubles that having brings and the troubles that not
having brings. You just be.</p><p><br></p><p>Being is the goal of Tao.</p><p><br></p><p>And one thing more to be understood: Being... you already are. There
is no becoming; you are not to become – it is already the case, you have
it within you. It just has to be allowed to open so that the perfume is
released to the winds; and that is the real song, the joy.</p><p><br></p><p>The man was singing, but the song was just a pretension; it came out
of consolation – it was not a true song. The man was playing on an
instrument, but it was not true music; because the true music comes only
when you are deeply rooted in yourself. Then YOU become the instrument
and God plays on it.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, if you are searching for consolation you will find it, but
it is a false coin. Comfortable, convenient, it is like a drug: you
start drinking and you remain miserable. The misery does not change, but
through drinking you start forgetting about it. Consolation is a sort of
intoxication, and nothing is changed because the door to misery remains
open – you still go on comparing. Comparison is the root cause of
misery. To be non-comparative – to be neither higher nor lower, just to
be yourself; not to think in relation to others, just to think in terms
of your tremendous aloneness – then you are happy.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard.…</p><p><br></p><p>She had one of those one-in-a-million figures. Luscious,
well-developed, neat with the perfect contour. But despite all these
gifts she developed a neurosis about peeping Toms.</p><p>‘What measures do you take to avoid this calamity?’ asked her
psychiatrist.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Well, I keep the shades down, I bar the windows and I always undress
behind a screen.’ ‘How do you keep the boys from peeking through the
keyhole?’</p><p>‘I leave the door open.’</p><p><br></p><p>Certainly, when you leave the door open nobody can peep through the
keyhole; but the door is open, so what is the point? Consolation is like
that: the door remains open, because consolation depends on comparison
and misery also depends on comparison. So the door is open, but you
become more and more intoxicated with consolation, more and more
suffocated by your own theorisations, rationalisations; more and more
insulated. Hiding behind your buffers, you miss life.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop comparing.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this parable, read ordinarily, will give you an impression that
Lieh Tzu is not saying anything against Confucius. That is their way of
saying things; they are very subtle people. He has not uttered a single
word against Confucius, and he has demolished the whole Confucian
philosophy. So when you are reading these parables, they are not simple
parables. Simple they are in a way, but they are very profound. You have
to dive deep, you have to dig, you have to go into them and you have to
know the difference between discipline and spontaneity.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever anything is of discipline, Tao is against it. Whenever
anything is of spontaneity, Tao is for it. Tao is spontaneity, Tao is
suchness, Tao is a tremendous acceptance of whatsoever is. And in that
acceptance one flowers.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Question 1
DO YOU HAVE FAVOURITES? AM I ONE OF THEM?
I am reminded of an Arabian proverb.
It is said that whenever God creates a person he whispers into his ear ‘You are my favourite.

AM I ONE OF THEM?\nI am reminded of an Arabian proverb.\nIt is said that whenever God creates a person he whispers into his ear ‘You are my favourite. I have never made such a beautiful person before, and I am not going to make such a beautiful person again.","keywords":[],"articleBody":"\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n‌CHAPTER 10\nYou are blessed\n20 February 1977 am in Buddha Hall\nQuestion 1\nDO YOU HAVE FAVOURITES? AM I ONE OF THEM?\nI am reminded of an Arabian proverb.\nIt is said that whenever God creates a person he whispers into his ear ‘You are my favourite. I have never made such a beautiful person before, and I am not going to make such a beautiful person again. You arc simply unique.’ But this he has been doing to everybody and everybody deep down in his heart thinks ‘Whatsoever God has said. one believes.’\nYou are my favourite. And this is not addressed to anybody in particular, but to everybody. In fact, to choose as favourite or not is not possible for me. It depends on you, you can become my favourite, you may not become; it is a one-way traffic. If you allow, you will become; if you don’t allow, you will not become. As far as I am concerned I am not.\nQuestion 2\nPLEASE EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RATIONALISATION AND ‘BULLSHIT’.\n‘Bullshit’ is a far better word than ‘rationalisation’, but they mean the same. ‘Rationalisation’ is a clinical word – a word to be used by the professor, ‘bullshit’ is more alive. ‘Rationalisation’ is bloodless, ‘bullshit’ is very young, alive and kicking. But the meaning is the same, they are not different things.\nThe henpecked husband and his wordy wife were walking down the country road having one of their arguments in the usual way. She was winning. Suddenly she turned and saw a bull charging down the road. There was no time to warn her husband so she jumped into a hedge. The bull caught the man on its horns and sent him spinning fifty feet into the air. He came down in a ditch. When he finally managed to crawl out, he saw his wife standing on the road.\n‘Maria’ he said ‘if you hit me like that again you’ll really make me lose my temper.’ Now this is bullshit. If you ask a psychoanalyst, he will call it a rationalisation.\nThe culture society was organising a group to be comprised strictly of virgins, when a young lady carrying a baby appeared.\n‘But, madam’ protested the president ‘that is evidence that you are not eligible for this society. Why do you think you will be able to join?’\n‘I was only foolin’ around when this happened’ she explained. ‘So I thought I could get in as one of those foolish virgins.’\nThis is bullshit. ‘Rationalisation’ is a philosophical term. ‘Bullshit’ comes from the ordinary man, from the masses, people who live on the earth, with the earth, whose hands are muddy. The word ‘bullshit’ is also muddy as it is being used by people who are working, living the ordinary life. It does not come from the ivory towers of a university. But remember, it is more authentic, it says much more than ‘rationalisation’. And always remember this, that words that are coined by professors are always anaemic. They are dead words – clinical, but do not say much; rather than saying, they hide. Let me say it in this way, the very word ‘rationalisation’ is a rationalisation: it is being used to avoid the word bullshit’.\nQuestion 3\nWHY DO YOU MAKE SO MANY MISTAKES WHEN YOU QUOTE OTHER PEOPLE OR REFER TO BIBLICAL EVENTS OR TO SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES? I HAVE ANSWERED THIS QUESTION MANY TIMES MYSELF IN VARIOUS WAYS. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOUR ANSWER.\nSo allow me to commit a few more mistakes. First: my memory is marvellous.\nMulla Nasruddin was talking to a man and he said ‘My wife has a very bad memory.’ And the man asked ‘Do you mean she forgets everything?’\nMulla Nasruddin said ‘No, she remembers everything!’\nIf Mulla Nasruddin’s wife has a bad memory, I have a marvellous memory. I forget everything. And I enjoy this forgetfulness; I am not worried about it.\nSecondly: I am an ignorant person. I am not a scholar. I enjoy reading books, but I read the Bible. the Gita, the Koran just as one reads novels; they are ancient, beautiful stories. Krishnamurti says he never reads any scripture; he reads only detective stories. I read the scripture, but I read in the scripture just the detective story and nothing else. And I would suggest to Krishnamurti that it would be good if he should look into the Bible; you cannot find a more beautiful story full of suspense. Everything is there: love. Life, murder; everything is there. It is very sensational.\nScriptures, to me, have nothing special. Scriptures are as sacred as the trees and the rocks and the stars – or as secular. I don’t make a distinction so I am not very serious about scriptures. The only thing I am serious about is jokes. So when I quote the scripture I quote from memory, when I quote a joke I have it written here in front of me. I never want to make any mistake about the joke – I am really serious. About everything else I am absolutely non-serious.\nSo it is very obvious. Listening to me you must have understood it. that my emphasis is not on what the scriptures say – that is not the point: my emphasis is on what I am saying. If you go to a Christian priest, he quotes the scripture, his emphasis is on the scripture. He is very literal. he has to be – he himself is secondary, the scripture is primary. He is a witness to the scripture. With me it is just the opposite: the scripture is just a witness to me. Whatsoever I have to say, only that have I to say. If I feel the scripture can be a witness to it, I use it.\nAnd I go on playing with the scripture, sometimes in one way, sometimes in another. Remember always, I am not trying to prove the scripture – that the scripture is right – I am simply using it as illustration. It is secondary, you can forget about it: nothing will be lost. Whatsoever I am saying is direct. Just to help you, because you are not capable of listening to the direct truth, you need a few witnesses. So Jesus, Krishna and Buddha and Lao Tzu and Lieh Tzu – they are just witnesses to me. I am not to adjust with them. they have to adjust with me.\nAnd this should always be so: the dead should exist and adjust with the living and for the living. Why should the living adjust with the dead? Lieh Tzu has to adjust with me, because only in adjusting with me can Lieh Tzu again have a little life. Jesus has to adjust with me, I am not to adjust with Jesus. The past has to adjust with the present. not otherwise. So I go on playing.…\nThese are all just stories to me and. deep down, this is the approach: the whole of life is a fiction, it is MAYA, it is a dream. Jesus and Buddha and Krishna and I and you are parts of a big dream – God is dreaming. Don’t be too serious about it. Scholars become too serious. I am not a scholar and I have no respect for scholars. In fact my attitude is exactly the same as Mulla Nasruddin’s.\nOnce it happened:\nA man came to Mulla Nasruddin and said ‘Nasruddin. have you heard? The great scholar of the town has died and twenty rupees are needed to bury him.’\nMulla gave him a hundred rupee note and said ‘Take it, and while you are doing it, why not bury five? Remember, these scholars are very calculating and cunning people – bury them as deep as possible, otherwise they will come back. And if you need more money, come to me, don’t be shy about it!’\nI am neither a scholar nor am I in any way respectful towards scholars or scholarship. That is all bullshit.\nI was reading a beautiful poem by E.Y. Harburg. A few lines are of tremendous import. Meditate over them.\nPoems are made by fools like me, But only God can make a tree; And only God who makes the tree Also makes the fools like me.\nBut only fools like me, you see,\nCan make a God, who makes a tree.\nI am tremendously ignorant, and I am happy as I am. and I have no idea to improve upon myself. So if sometimes you are in an awkward situation: somebody says that Osho has said this and this is not correct, it is your problem. Then your Master is found faulty... you feel a little disturbed, your ego is hurt. As far as I am concerned I am perfectly okay. And I will continue to create problems for you! Now you find the answers. Invent something, be a little imaginative or inventive. When I can invent so much, why can’t you? You can find some esoteric, occult meaning in it. It is always easy: when you cannot find anything else, always try to find some esoteric, occult meaning in it – there must be.\nThe handsome, well-dressed man handed the poor beggar a five dollar bill. ‘Here, my good man’ he said ‘eat your fill and there’s enough for a drink or two.’\nThe beggar entered Tony’s restaurant, where he ate the biggest dinner of his life and then topped it off with a bottle of wine and a big tip to Luigi, the waiter. ‘Ah’ said the handsome, well-dressed stranger ‘it’s a good world. Everyone is happy. The poor beggar because he is no longer hungry, Tony because he has made a big sale, the waiter because he has received a nice tip. And me?... l’m happy too, because the bill was counterfeit.’\nSo make everybody happy. Create a few fictions, a few counterfeit bills; make everybody happy. The world is really beautiful.\nDon’t be bothered too much about facts there are none, all are fictions. Remember, ALL are fictions, even my being here and your being here is a tremendous fiction. Nothing ever happens. Truth is. All that happens is fictitious; history is a fiction because whatsoever is, is... nothing ever happens there. God has no history and God has no biography. God only is, there is no ‘was’ and there is no ‘will be’. There is no past and no future.\nAll history is fictitious. That’s why in the East we have never been bothered by history, we have not written history at all – instead of history we have written myths. If you ask when Rama was born, Hindus cannot answer. Ask Hindus, and you will find as many answers as the persons you ask.\nNobody knows, in fact nobody knows exactly whether he was born or not. The fiction is that the story writer who wrote the story of Rama, wrote it before Rama was born: Balmiki wrote it before Rama was born. Look at the Eastern approach. You cannot conceive of it, that the Christian apostles should write the story of Jesus before he was ever born. But Balmiki wrote the story of Rama before he was born and then Rama had to be born to prove that Balmiki was right, otherwise people would laugh at this old man. And he had written so, ‘So do it!’ So he had to do the things that Balmiki had written already. He had prophesied it, it was a prediction, and then Rama followed. Look at the approach: history is thought of as fiction. Only novels are written first, then you can play, you can make a movie out of them.\nIn the secret traditions of the Essenes it is said that Christ never was, that in fact it was a drama, a Christ drama, that had been played for centuries before Christ was ever born. In fact he was never born, it was just a drama. By and by, people became so much attached to the drama, they started loving the drama so much, that it turned out becoming a reality; it started looking like a fact. That’s why there are so many versions. If you look into the four gospels, all are different, sometimes contradictory. Four persons writing the same story are bound to be different.\nThe Eastern way of looking at things is that whatsoever is cannot be seen by the eyes. And whatsoever can be seen by the eyes is just a fiction – enjoy while you are seeing it, love it – it is LEELA, God’s play. So when I am saying things to you, these are not sermons – a sermon is a serious thing – these are just like the songs of the birds. So whatsoever surfaces in me, I tell you; and I am not worried whether it is proved by history or not because history itself is meaningless to me.\nQuestion 4\nWHY HAS THERE NEVER BEEN A SINGLE WOMAN ENLIGHTENED MASTER?\nA woman cannot be a Master – it is not possible. When a woman arrives she becomes a Mistress, not a Master. The fulfilment of a woman is love. The flowering of a woman is love. Mastery is not the goal of the feminine mind; they don’t become Masters, they become Mistresses. To be a Master is basically a male effort.\nAwareness is the way of man, love is the way Or woman.\nOn the path of awareness it is possible to teach; one can become a Master. On the path of love, how can you teach love? You can flower, you can bloom in love, but how can you teach it? Yes, if somebody wants to learn from you, he will learn it, but you will not be a Master. And such women have existed: Rabiya, Meera, Mallibai, Magdalen, Teresa. Such women have existed: Sahajo, Daya, Lalla. Many women have existed, but they were not Masters. They were so surrendered to God that they became Mistresses.\nMeera says ‘I am a mistress to you. My Lord’ – a mistress to Krishna, to God himself. She sings the song of the glory of her Lord, she dances. If somebody can catch something from her, it is overflowing; but she cannot be a teacher. She is surrendered, her surrender is absolute. Yes, if you are in her company, you will learn what surrender is... but you will have to learn, she will not teach. A woman cannot be a teacher.\nTo teach, a certain different quality of energy is needed. Let me say it in this way, this is my experience: it is very difficult for a man to become a disciple, very difficult for a man to become a disciple. Even if he becomes, he becomes reluctantly. Surrender is difficult. How to surrender the will? Even if he surrenders, he only surrenders conditionally, in order to become a Master one day. He becomes a disciple in order to become a Master. It is difficult for a man to surrender; it is very simple for a woman to surrender. It is very simple for a woman to become a disciple, it is very difficult for a woman to become a Master. Even after she has arrived, she remains surrendered. And for the man, even when he has not arrived, he remains deep down unsurrendered. On the surface he will show surrender, but deep down somewhere the ego persists.\nA man can become a good Master. A woman can become a good disciple because to become a disciple means to become a receiver, to be receptive, to become a womb. To become a Master means to become a giver.\nThe same phenomenon continues... as it is there on the biological level, it remains on the spiritual level. Biologically, a woman is ready to receive the sperm from the man she loves. The man cannot become a mother, he can only become a father. He can trigger the process: the woman will become the mother, she will carry the child in her womb for nine months, she will nourish the child with her blood and her being, she will be carrying the pregnancy. The same happens on the spiritual level too.\nWhen a woman comes to a Master she is immediately ready to surrender. If sometimes it happens otherwise – sometimes there are women who are very reluctant to surrender that simply shows they have lost contact with their womanhood. They don’t know who they are, they have become distracted from their centre. They don’t know how to surrender because they don’t know how to be a woman. If you know how to be a woman, if you are a woman, surrender is so simple, it comes so easily.\nAll the great disciples in the world were women. Buddha had thousands of disciples, but the proportion has always been the same: three women, one man. So was the proportion with Mahavir. He had forty thousand sannyasins: ten thousand men, thirty thousand women. And so was the case with Jesus.\nThe really devoted people around him were not the men but the women. When he was crucified, all the men escaped, there was not a single man. All those so-called ‘apostles’ had all disappeared, but the women were there. Three women were there: they had no fear, they were ready to sacrifice themselves. When Jesus was taken down from the cross, it was not by men – those disciples had gone far away, and one or two were there but they were hiding in the crowd women took down the body. And it is very significant that when Jesus appeared after three days, resurrected, he appeared first to Mary Magdalen, not to a man. This is very significant. Why? What about those twelve apostles? Why to Mary Magdalen? And she immediately recognised him, and she rushed to him and she said ‘So, My Lord, you are still alive!’ And when Jesus appeared to the disciples, male disciples, they would not recognise him, they thought ‘It seems tricky. How can this man come back?’\nIt is said that when he appeared before two disciples, male disciples, he walked with them for hours and they would not recognise him. And they continued talking about Jesus and Jesus was walking\nby their side. They were a little puzzled about the appearance of this man – he looked like Jesus but how could he be? ‘Just appearance? – one should not be deceived by appearance alone.’ For two hours they walked together. When they went to an inn, all three sat there to eat their dinner and when Jesus broke his bread, THEN they recognised. Very materialistic mind. Suddenly they saw... because Jesus’ every act, his every gesture, was his, authentically his. Now they recognised because he was breaking the bread in the same way that they had seen Jesus break bread for years – then they recognised. But for two hours, the presence was not recognised. Magdalen recognised immediately. When she went to tell the male disciples that Jesus was resurrected, they laughed. They said ‘Woman, you are hallucinating.’ And they laughed and they said ‘This is how women always are – imaginative, dreaming, romantic. Now look at this foolish woman. Jesus is dead. We have seen him die on the cross with our own eyes.’ But she cried and she said ‘Listen to me. I have seen him.’ But they would not listen.\nA woman can be a perfect disciple, and this is how it should be. Woman is receptive, an opening, a womb. They have never been Masters in the sense that men have been Masters – like Mahavir, Buddha, Zarathustra, Lao Tzu. No, they have never been Masters like that. But there have never been disciples like women; no man has ever been able to equal them as far as disciplehood is concerned. And let me tell you this, that as far as this division of male and female is concerned, the female mind is more blessed. Because the real thing is to receive the truth, the real thing is not to give it that is secondary. And a woman is always more total than a man. Whenever she receives the truth, she becomes luminous: her whole body, her whole being shows it; she carries an aura. Have you not seen a woman who is pregnant, how beautiful she becomes? Her face glows, she is carrying a new life within her. And this is nothing compared to a woman who really becomes a disciple. She is carrying God himself within her. Her glory is infinite.\nSo don’t be worried why women don’t become Masters. There is no need. If you can become disciples, that is natural and you will always remain true to nature.\nQuestion 5\nYESTERDAY YOU SAID THAT ZEN IS THE BEAUTIFUL RESULT OF MELTING TAO AND BUDDHISM, AND SUFISM THE FLOWER THAT BLOOMS OUT OF ISLAM AND HINDUISM. IS YOUR TEACHING THE SUPER-FLOWER, THE CROSS-BREEDING BETWEEN ZEN AND SUFISM?\nIt is not a flower, it is just a meeting of two fragrances. Zen is a superflower, so is Sufism. Nothing can be added to them; they are perfect. As far as flowers are concerned, they have attained to perfection; nothing more can be added to them, they have bloomed. What I am doing here is trying to fuse their fragrances.\nA rose has flowered and so has flowered a lotus. Both arc spreading their fragrances to the wind. What I am doing here is trying to fuse their fragrance, which is a very subtle phenomenon. A flower is gross, fragrance is subtle. A flower is visible, fragrance is invisible. A flower is material, fragrance is simply spiritual. That’s what I am doing here trying to bring together all the flowers of Tantra, of Yoga, of Tao, of Sufism, of Zen, of Hasidism, Jews, Moslems. Hindus, Buddhists. Jains-l am trying to bring together all the fragrances that have been released down the centuries. This is a great experiment which has never been done before. Buddha is concerned only with the path through which he has attained. so is Mahavir, so is Jesus. Never before on the earth – has this been done.\nYou are blessed, you are fortunate. You may not realise this right now, nobody realises it when the moment is alive. Have you ever thought about it? Were Jesus’ disciples aware of what was happening when it was happening? Were they aware that something of tremendous import was happening in their lives which was going to decide the destiny of humanity for centuries to come? No, they were not aware. Were Buddha’s disciples aware that something of great import was happening You are also not aware. Something of tremendous import is happening which has not happened ever, which is going to be decisive, because now the old religions cannot survive in the future; their days are gone.\nIn the future, a few things will disappear. Nations will have to disappear because the earth has become a small village; now they are meaningless. India and Pakistan and China and America and Canada and England and Germany are meaningless; the earth has become one. The day man became capable of going beyond gravitation, the earth became one. The first man in a spaceship started crying when he saw the whole earth as one. Nobody had ever seen the whole earth as one. He looked at the earth he could not believe how there could be any divisions of America and Russia and China and this and that. He could not think about himself as American or Russian. He could think about himself only as an earth-dweller. And he could not see any divisions of the earth because divisions are only on the political maps; the earth remains undivided. The day man crossed the barrier of gravitation, became free from gravitation, the earth became one. It is now only a question of timeNations will have to disappear, and with nations will disappear the world\nof the politicians and the world of politics. A great nightmare will disappear from the earth.\nAnd the second thing to disappear with the nations is Hinduism, Mohammedanism, Christianity, Judaism. Just as politics have divided the map of the earth, religions have divided the consciousness of man Certainly the division of religion is more dangerous than the division of politics, because politics can only divide the earth... religions have divided the consciousness of man. Man has not been allowed total access to his being. One has to be just a Mohammedan – a very narrow thing. One has to be just a Hindu – just a very narrow thing. Why. when you can have the whole heritage? When the whole past is yours and the whole future is yours, why should you divide? Why should I call myself ‘a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Christian’? One should claim the total. By claiming the total you become total: you lose all narrow divisions, distinctions, you become whole. you become holy. That is going to happen, that is bound to happen. That HAS to happen. otherwise man will not be able to grow any more.\nThis is very crucial that man has to drop all barriers.of nation and religion and church. That’s what I am doing here: trying to bring together all the fragrances released in different centuries by differing flowerings of human consciousness. Lao Tzu is a flower, so is Buddha, so is Jesus, so is Mohammed, but now we have to melt all their fragrances into one – a universal fragrance. Then, for the first time, man will be able to be religious and yet undivided. Then the church is yours and the mosque too and the temple too. Then the Gita is yours, and the Koran and the Vedas and the Bible – everything is yours. You become vast.\nNo, I am not trying to create a new flower – flowers have happened. I am trying to create a new perfume out of all those flowers. It is more subtle, more invisible; only those who have eyes will be able to see it.\nQuestion 6\nTHE DANGER OF YOUR TALKS ON TAOISM IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF LAZY, IRRESPONSIBLE PEOPLE AROUND WHO RATIONALISE THEIR BAD HABITS BY CLAIMING TO BE INACTIVE TAOISTS. PLEASE CLARIFY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TAOIST AND A LAZY ESCAPIST.\nThe question is from Anand Prem.\nThe first thing, there are two dangers I have talked about: one is of egoism, another is of lethargy, laziness. And remember, if you have to fall into any trap, the trap of laziness is better than the trap of egoism. That is more dangerous, because the lazy person has never done anything wrong, a lazy person cannot do. He will never do any good – okay, but he will never do any wrong either. He will not bother to kill anybody, to torture anybody, to create concentration camps, to go to war he will not bother. He says ‘Why? When one can rest, why?’ A lazy person is not naturally a danger. The only thing that he may miss may be his own spiritual growth, but he will not interfere with anybody else’s growth; he will not be an interference. He will not be a do-gooder and these are the greatest, most mischievous people in the world the do-gooders. A lazy person is almost absent. What can he do? Have you ever heard of any lazy person doing anything wrong?\nNo, Anand Prem, the real problem comes from the egoist, and that is Anand Prem’s possibility. Don’t be worried about a few people here getting lazy – let them, nothing is wrong. The real problem is from the egoist; one who wants to be spiritual, one who wants to be special, one who wants to become a SIDDHA, one who wants to attain spiritual powers. One wants to prove something spiritually in the world: that is the real danger. If you have to fall, choose laziness. If you cannot fall, if you have to avoid, good to avoid BOTH.\nLaziness is just like the common cold – nothing much to worry about. Ego is like cancer. It is better not to have either. But if you have to choose and you would like to have something to cling to, the common cold is good – you can depend on it, it never kills anybody, it has never killed anybody. But never choose cancer, and that is the greater possibility.\nNow she asks ‘The danger of your talks on Taoism is that there are a lot of lazy, irresponsible people...’.\nThe first thing: the moment you start thinking about others you are getting into an ego-trip. Who are you to think about others and their life? It is their life. If they feel like being lazy, who are you to interfere? Anand Prem has a do-gooder in her being; she is very worried about others – that is a dangerous thing. And of course she is condemnatory. This question has a condemnation: ‘The danger of your talks on Taoism is that there a lot of lazy, irresponsible people around who rationalise their bad habits by claiming to be inactive Taoists.’ Who are you to tell them that their habits are bad?\nLaziness is a better habit than to be obsessed by activity. To be obsessed by activity is madness. A lazy person can be sane. Sometimes the laziest people have been found to be the sanest. I have the feeling that if Anand Prem comes across Lao Tzu, she will think he is lazy. He will look lazy to all purposes. If she comes across Diogenes, she will think he is lazy. If she comes around Buddha she will think he is lazy. Sitting under the Bodhi Tree...’what are you doing? At least you can run a primary school and teach children, or you can open a hospital and serve ill people. So many people are dying, starving... what are you doing here sitting under the Bodhi Tree?’\nAnand Prem would have jumped upon Buddha and taken him to task. ‘What are you doing? Just sitting, meditating? Is this the time to meditate? Is this the time to be just sitting silently and enjoying your bliss? This is selfish!’ This condemnatory attitude is really dangerous: it gives you an idea of holier than thou, ‘I am better than you. You... you lazy people!’ She goes on writing questions every day that I have not been answering; every day – that ‘these people are hippies, these people are useless.’\nShe is in search of a lover, but she cannot find one here because she thinks that nobody here.… She wants a ‘straight person’ and she cannot find a straight person here. These are all ‘hippies and yippies’ and she wants somebody who is well-established. She wrote a letter. ‘... well-established, has a bank account, is a gentleman, a squire, has prestige, respectability. Here these people are just hobos, wanderers, vagabonds.’ She would have refused Buddha, she would have refused Lao Tzu: they were not straight. She writes to me: ‘... these long-haired people!’ With such disgust she writes, and because of this disgust she has become a very disgusting person and she will not find. For one year she has been in the West in search. She is a Jew. First she searched in America, then she went to Israel to search for a man. She could not find in America, she could not find in Israel – she will never find anywhere. Even if she goes to heaven, God will look like a hobo. She has such condemnatory attitudes that she cannot love a simple human being. Yes, there are flaws, there are limitations, but everybody has those limitations. If you want to love, you have to love a man with all his limitations.\nYou cannot find a perfect person. Perfection does not exist. God never allows perfection because perfection is so monotonous. Just think: living with a perfect person... twenty-four hours, and you will commit suicide. Living with a perfect person? Then how will you live? He will be more like a marble statue, dead. The moment a person becomes perfect, he is dead. An alive person is never perfect, and my teaching is basically not for perfection but for totality.\nBe total, and remember the difference. The ideal of perfection says: Be like this – no anger, no jealousy, no possessiveness, no flaws, no limitations. The ideal of totality is totally different: If you are angry, be totally angry. If you are loving, be totally loving. If you are sad, be totally sad. Nothing is denied – only partiality has to be dropped, and then a person becomes beautiful.\nA total person is beautiful. A perfect person is dead.\nI am not trying to create MAHATMAS here. Enough! Those MAHATMAS have done enough nonsense in the world. We need beautiful people, flowering, flowing, alive. Yes, they will be sometimes sad, but what is wrong in being sad? Sometimes they will be angry, but what is wrong in sometimes being angry? It simply shows that you are alive, that you are not a dead thing, that you are not driftwood. Sometimes you fight, sometimes you let go. Just like climates change: it is rainy sometimes and it is cloudy, and sometimes it is sunny and the clouds have disappeared. And all seasons are needed – the cold, the heat, the winter, the summer – all seasons are needed. And a real man, an authentic man, has all the climates in his being – only with one awareness: that whatsoever he is doing he should do totally and should do with full awareness – enough, that’s enough, and you have a beautiful person.\nBut Anand Prem is in search of a perfect man. I have heard.…\nOnce a man travelled all over the world.… Whenever I look at Anand Prem, I again and again remember that man, He travelled all over the world in search of a perfect woman. He wanted to get married, but how to accept an imperfect model? – he wanted a perfect woman. He came back, his whole life wasted; he could not find. Then one day a friend said ‘But now you are seventy and you searched your whole life, couldn’t you find a single perfect woman?’\nHe said ‘Yes, once I came across one woman who was perfect.’ So the friend asked ‘Then what happened?’\nBut the man became sad, he said ‘What happened? That woman was in search of a perfect man, so nothing happened!’\nRemember, the ideal of perfection is an egoistic ideal.\nRonald Coleman told Herb Stein about a Hollywood phony who spoke with a fake Oxford accent, wore a fake Purple Star and Phi Beta Kappa key – and worst of all, passed a lot of fake cheques. At the end of his rope, he decided to commit suicide, and went down to the Santa Fe railroad tracks. He calmly smoked several imported cigarettes while three or four heavy freights puffed by. A tramp who was watching jeered. ‘lf you’re gonna do it, why don’t you do it?’\n‘Don’t be vulgar’ squelched the phony. ‘A man like me waits for the Super Chief.’\nEven if an egoist goes to commit suicide, he waits for the Super Chief, the best train. He says ‘Don’t be vulgar. A man like me waits for the Super Chief.’ Even if he is committing suicide, he will not commit under a goods train.\nMarriage is like suicide – you can commit anywhere. You should not wait for the Super Chief. Anand Prem is in search and it is impossible for her, the way she looks at things with such condemnation, to find anybody whom she can love.\n‘Please clarify the difference between a Taoist and a lazy escapist.’\nThere is not much, and if there is, it is so inner that only the person will know – you will never be able to judge from the outside. Look at me. I am also a lazy person. Have you seen me doing anything, ever? It is very difficult from the outside to know. And I love lazy persons... Taoists or not; I love lazy persons because out of lazy persons never any Adolf Hitler is born, never any Genghis Khan, never any Tamburlaine. Lazy people have silently lived their lives and disappeared, without leaving any trace on history, without contaminating humanity. They have not polluted consciousness. They were here as if they were not. To be lazy and aware... and you have become a Taoist. It does not mean that you become inactive. It simply means that the obsessive activity disappears. It simply means that you have become capable of not-doing too.\nIt is said about a Zen Master that a person asked one of his disciples ‘What miracles can your Master do?’\nAnd the disciple said ‘Are you a follower of somebody?’\nAnd the man said ‘Yes, I am a follower of a certain Master and he is a great-miracle-man; he can do great miracles. Once it happened that I was standing on this shore of the bank and he was standing on the other shore, and he shouted to me “I want to write something in your book.” And it was almost a half-mile-wide river. So I took my book out, raised it, and from the other shore he started writing with his fountain pen and the writing came on my book. This miracle I have seen and the book is with me – you can see.’\nAnd the disciple of the other Master laughed and he said ‘My Master can do greater miracles.’ So the man said ‘What miracles?’\nAnd the disciple said ‘My Master can do miracles, and he is so capable... SO CAPABLE that he is capable of not doing them too.’\n‘Not doing them too.’ See the beauty of it. He is ‘so capable... SO CAPABLE... of not doing them too.’\nA Taoist is a man who does only that which is absolutely necessary. His life is almost like a telegram. When you go to the Post Office you don’t write a long letter when you are giving a telegraphic message. You go on cutting words, this and this can be dropped and then you come to ten or nine or whatsoever. If you write a letter you will never write only ten words. And have you watched the thing? A telegram is more expressive than all letters. It says much more in very few words. The unnecessary is dropped, only the most necessary is there. A Taoist is telegraphic, his life is like a telegram. The obsessive, the unnecessary, the feverish, has been dropped. He does only that which is absolutely necessary. And let me tell you that the absolutely necessary is so little that you will see a Taoist almost as if he were lazy.\nBut remember, I am not praising laziness. I am simply condemning the egoistic attitude. Against ego – I am for laziness. But I am not for laziness itself; it should be full of awareness. Then you pass from activity and from laziness both. Then you become transcendental. You are neither active, nor inactive; you are centred. Whatsoever is needed you do it, whatsoever is not needed you don’t do it. You are neither a doer nor a non-doer. Doing is no more your focus. You are a consciousness.\nSo please don’t take whatsoever I have said in the sense that I am helping you to be lazy. To be REALLY lazy means not to be inactive, but to be so full of energy that you are a reservoir of energy. Lazy as far as the world is concerned, but tremendously dynamic inside, not dull.\nA Taoist is lazy from the outside; from the inside he has become a river-like phenomenon, he is continuously flowing towards the ocean. He has dropped many activities because they were unnecessarily leaking his energy. The danger is always there – in whatsoever I say there is danger – the danger of interpretation. If I say ‘Be active’, there is the possibility that you will become egoists. If I say ‘Be inactive’, there is the possibility that you may become dull. Man is very cunning.\nI have heard.…\nHe was the kind of a guy who would bet on anything – provided he was sure of winning. ‘I’ll bet my wife’s first words will be “my dear” when I get home’ he said to Lucky.\nLucky took him up on it. He knew his wife very well and she would be the last woman in the world to say ‘my dear’.\nMust have been like Anand Prem.\nLucky took him up on it and they bet a hundred dollars. When they got to the sport’s house he stuck his head in the door and called ‘My dear, I’m home.’\n‘“My dear” be hanged!’ roared his wife. ‘Wait till I get you inside!’\nAnd he looked at Lucky and said ‘Give me a hundred dollars. Didn’t I tell you that the first words she would ever utter would be “my dear”?’\nMind is very cunning. The wife is saying ‘“My dear” be hanged I wait till I get you inside!’ But you can interpret... so he is demanding a hundred dollars. Mind is cunning. It goes on interpreting in its own ways; it goes on finding reasons, rationalisations, tricks to defend. It wants to remain as it is. That is the whole effort of the mind: it wants to remain as it is. If it is lazy, it wants to remain lazy. If it is active – too active, obsessively active it wants to remain active. So whatsoever I say, you have to be careful not to defend your mind. You have to come out of your mind.\nThe man burst angrily through the door, threw his wife off the stranger’s knee and angrily demanded ‘How do I find you kissing my wife?’\n‘I don’t know’ said the stranger. ‘Maybe you’re home early?’\nPeople can find reasons. Be alert. And be alert about your own self, not about others. This is none of your business what others are doing. This should be one of the basic attitudes of a religious person – not to think about what the other is doing; that is his life. If he decides to live it that way, that is his business. Who are you even to have an opinion about it? Even to have an opinion means that you are ready to interfere, you have already interfered. A religious person is one who is trying to live his life the best, the most total way he can; the most alert way that he can he is trying. And he is not interfering with anybody’s life, not even by having an opinion. Have you watched, observed? If you pass somebody and you have a certain opinion about him, your face changes, your eyes change, your attitude, your walk. If you are condemnatory, your whole being starts broadcasting condemnation, disgust. No, you are interfering.\nTo be really religious means to be non-interfering. Give freedom to people; freedom is their birthright.\nOnce it happened, I stayed with one of my professors, my teachers. Though I was a student and he was my teacher, he was very respectful of me. He was a rare, religious man but he was a drunkard, and when I stayed in his home, he was very afraid to drink in front of me. What would I think? I watched him, I felt his restlessness, so the next day I told him ‘There is something on your mind. If you don’t relax, I will immediately leave and go to a hotel; I will not stay. There is something on your mind. I feel that you are not at ease, my presence is creating some trouble.’\nHe said ’Since you have raised the problem, I would like to tell you. I have never told you that I drink too much, but I always drink in my home and go to sleep. Now that you are staying here I don’t want\nto drink before you and that is creating the trouble. I cannot remain without drinking but I cannot even conceive of drinking in front of you.’\nI laughed. I said ‘This is foolish. What have I to do with it? You will not force me to drink.’ He said ‘No, never.’\n‘Then it is finished; the problem is solved. You drink and I will keep you company. I will not drink but I can drink something else Coca-Cola or Fanta, I will keep you company, you drink. I can fill your glass, I can help you.’\nHe could not believe it, he thought I was joking. But when in the night I filled his glass, he started crying. He said ‘I had never thought that you would not have any opinion about it. And I have been watching you’ he said ‘and you don’t have any opinion about my drinking, about my behaviour, about what I am doing.’\nI said ‘To have an opinion about you is simply foolish. It is not something very great that I haven’t any opinion about you. Why should I have in the first place? Who am l? It is your life – you want to drink, you drink.’\nTo have an opinion about you means that deep down somewhere I want to manipulate you. To have some opinion about you, this way or that, means that I have a deep desire to be powerful over people. That’s what a politician is. A religious person should be non-interfering.\nQuestion 7\nYOU SPEAK A LOT ABOUT THE UGLINESS OF JEALOUSY. YES, IT IS QUITE UGLY, BUT ANY SUGGESTIONS TO US SUFFERERS OF THE DISEASE WHO AREN’T ENLIGHTENED ON HOW TO DIMINISH IT?\nFirst, diminishing it is not going to help. You can diminish it to such proportions that it will almost become invisible, but that is not going to help. Diminishing simply means that you are throwing it into the unconscious and it goes into your basement of being more and more deeply. It becomes invisible. You may not be able to see it, but it will go on working from the back, it will go on pulling your strings from the back. It will become more subtle. Please don’t try to diminish it.\nThe first thing to remember: rather than diminish it, magnify it so you can see the whole of it. That is the whole process of all the groups going on around here – Gestalt, Encounter, Psychodrama. The whole process is that whatsoever the problem is, please don’t diminish it but magnify it. Bring it totally as it is – even exaggerate it so that you can see every detail of it. Down the centuries in the past, jealousy, anger, sadness, this and that, all have been repressed. The effort was to diminish it. No, a seed is a diminished tree, but a seed is tremendously powerful. A seed can at any time again produce a tree. The right situation, the right season... and the tree will again sprout. You can diminish your jealousy, it can become just a seed, and you will not be able to see it the tree has disappeared, but it is there.\nDiminishing is not the right process. That’s what you have been doing, that’s what you have done to your life: you have diminished everything. And one thing more. When you diminish jealousy, your\nlove will be diminished alongside, because your love and jealousy are so much entangled with each other. If you diminish your sadness, your happiness will be diminished, because your happiness and sadness are so much together. If you diminish your hate, your love will disappear – that’s what has happened. You have been taught not to hate and the total result is that you have become incapable of love.\nNo, please don’t diminish anything. That is not the way. Rather, magnify, exaggerate, bring it to its total blossoming and then see it – every detail of it, every minute detail of it. In that very awareness, in that very seeing, you will become capable of transcending it and then there will be no need to do anything about it.\nThe second thing: you say ‘You speak a lot about the ugliness of jealousy. Yes, it is ugly...’. No, you don’t know. You are simply repeating what I have been saying. If you know it is quite ugly, in that very knowing it will disappear. You don’t know. You have listened to me, you have listened to Jesus, you have listened to Buddha and you have gathered opinions. You don’t know. It is not your own feel that jealousy is ugly. If it is your own feel, why should you carry it? It is not an easy thing, it takes a lot of investment. To be jealous is a very difficult thing: it needs a lot of effort on your part, a lot of involvement. It is so destructive of your own self that if it is ugly and you have known the ugliness of it, you cannot carry it for a single moment. But listening to me you become knowledgeable.\nI have heard...\n‘You can’t come in here’ the worried mother warned ‘my son is sick.’\n‘I want to catch your son’s measles’ the man said ‘because if I kissed the nurse she’d get it. She would kiss the doctor and he’d get it. The doctor would kiss my wife and she’d get it. My wife would kiss the landlord and that’s the guy I’m after.’\nIt is a great investment, a great effort and a very complex phenomenon.\nAnd finally, it may destroy. It may not destroy others – it certainly destroys you; it is suicidal. Not only that it is ugly, it is poisonous; it is suicidal, it is killing yourself every day, slowly, slowly.\nSee the fact of it. Don’t just become knowledgeable. What I say will not become an experience for you unless YOU experience it. And what is the way to experience it? The way is to bring it in front of you. It is hiding behind you.\nDon’t just become knowledgeable. What I say will not become an experience for you unless YOU experience it. And what is the way to experience it? The way is to bring it in front of you. It is hiding behind you.\nDon’t repress it, express it. Sit in your room, close the doors, bring your jealousy into focus. Watch it, see it, let it take as strong a flame as possible. Let it become a strong flame, burn into it and see what it is. And don’t from the very beginning say that this is ugly, because that very idea that this is ugly will repress it, will not allow it total expression. No opinions! Just try to see the existential effect of what jealousy is, the existential fact. No interpretations, no ideologies! Forget Buddhas and work, forget me. Just let the jealousy be there. Look into it, look deeply into it and so do with anger, so\ndo with sadness, hatred, possessiveness. And by and by you will see that just by seeing through things you start getting a transcendental feeling that you are JUst a witness; the identity is broken. The identity is broken only when you encounter something within you.\nQuestion 8\nWHAT DO YOU SAY TO SOMEONE WHO, NO MATTER WHAT PATHS YOU TALK ABOUT, ALWAYS FEELS THAT HE HAS ONE FOOT ON EACH OF THEM? AND DON’T SAY THAT THIS MUST BE MY PATH! YOU ONLY MENTIONED TWO YESTERDAY, REMEMBER? DID I JUST PUT MY FOOT IN IT?\nYou cannot put, by the very nature of it. Those paths are so diametrically opposite that you cannot put one foot on one path, the other foot on another path – that is impossible. You must be imagining, you must be dreaming, hallucinating. It is so diametrically opposite – just as you cannot be alive and dead together. If you think you are both, you are simply alive and nothing else, because even to think one has to be alive.\nIt is said Mulla Nasruddin once asked.…\nSomebody had died and he rushed home and asked his wife ‘You are very wise, just tell me one thing: if some day I die, how am I to decide whether I have really died or not? I have seen somebody die, one day or other I am going to die. but how will I know?’\nThe wife said ‘Don’t be foolish, you will know it. You will become cold.’\nSo, one day it happened. He was cutting wood in the forest, and it was a very cold day and he started feeling cold. He said ‘Okay, so the last day has come. So I am becoming cold.’ So he said good-bye to his donkey – because only the donkey was there – and thinking that he was going to die, he made himself comfortable under the tree, closed his eyes.… What else to do? Of course, when he closed his eyes, lying down under the tree, he became even more cold. So he said ‘Certain... death is certain; now it is coming. I am becoming more and more cold.’\nThen, just out of curiosity, he opened one of his eyes and looked at the donkey... what was happening to the donkey? And a wolf had attacked the donkey! So he said ‘What can I do?’ But still he said loudly ‘You can take freedom with my donkey because I am dead. If I had been alive I would have shown you! But what can I do now?’\nTalking, thinking, how can you be dead? Even to think this much is enough proof that you are alive.\nNo, you must have misunderstood. You cannot be on both paths. Look again. It is possible you may not be on either, but you cannot be on both.\nQuestion 9\nYOU SAID TODAY ‘ASK A BUDDHA WHY HE IS HAPPY AND HE WILL SHRUG HIS SHOULDERS.’ PLEASE, OSHO, WHY ARE YOU HAPPY?\nI will not even shrug my shoulders.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9098","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/tao_the_pathless_path_vol_1/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/tao_the_pathless_path_vol_1/>Tao.

AM I ONE OF THEM?</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of an Arabian proverb.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that whenever God creates a person he whispers into his
ear ‘You are my favourite. I have never made such a beautiful person
before, and I am not going to make such a beautiful person again. You
arc simply unique.’ But this he has been doing to everybody and
everybody deep down in his heart thinks ‘Whatsoever God has said. one
believes.’</p><p><br></p><p>You are my favourite. And this is not addressed to anybody in
particular, but to everybody. In fact, to choose as favourite or not is
not possible for me. It depends on you, you can become my favourite, you
may not become; it is a one-way traffic. If you allow, you will become;
if you don’t allow, you will not become. As far as I am concerned I am
not.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>PLEASE EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RATIONALISATION AND
‘BULLSHIT’.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Bullshit’ is a far better word than ‘rationalisation’, but they mean
the same. ‘Rationalisation’ is a clinical word – a word to be used by
the professor, ‘bullshit’ is more alive. ‘Rationalisation’ is bloodless,
‘bullshit’ is very young, alive and kicking. But the meaning is the
same, they are not different things.</p><p>The henpecked husband and his wordy wife were walking down the
country road having one of their arguments in the usual way. She was
winning. Suddenly she turned and saw a bull charging down the road.
There was no time to warn her husband so she jumped into a hedge. The
bull caught the man on its horns and sent him spinning fifty feet into
the air. He came down in a ditch. When he finally managed to crawl out,
he saw his wife standing on the road.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Maria’ he said ‘if you hit me like that again you’ll really make me
lose my temper.’ Now this is bullshit. If you ask a psychoanalyst, he
will call it a rationalisation.</p><p>The culture society was organising a group to be comprised strictly
of virgins, when a young lady carrying a baby appeared.</p><p><br></p><p>‘But, madam’ protested the president ‘that is evidence that you are
not eligible for this society. Why do you think you will be able to
join?’</p><p><br></p><p>‘I was only foolin’ around when this happened’ she explained. ‘So I
thought I could get in as one of those foolish virgins.’</p><p><br></p><p>This is bullshit. ‘Rationalisation’ is a philosophical term.
‘Bullshit’ comes from the ordinary man, from the masses, people who live
on the earth, with the earth, whose hands are muddy. The word ‘bullshit’
is also muddy as it is being used by people who are working, living the
ordinary life. It does not come from the ivory towers of a university.
But remember, it is more authentic, it says much more than
‘rationalisation’. And always remember this, that words that are coined
by professors are always anaemic. They are dead words – clinical, but do
not say much; rather than saying, they hide. Let me say it in this way,
the very word ‘rationalisation’ is a rationalisation: it is being used
to avoid the word bullshit’.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>WHY DO YOU MAKE SO MANY MISTAKES WHEN YOU QUOTE OTHER PEOPLE OR REFER
TO BIBLICAL EVENTS OR TO SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES? I HAVE ANSWERED THIS
QUESTION MANY TIMES MYSELF IN VARIOUS WAYS. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR
YOUR ANSWER.</p><p><br></p><p>So allow me to commit a few more mistakes. First: my memory is
marvellous.</p><p>Mulla Nasruddin was talking to a man and he said ‘My wife has a very
bad memory.’ And the man asked ‘Do you mean she forgets everything?’</p><p>Mulla Nasruddin said ‘No, she remembers everything!’</p><p><br></p><p>If Mulla Nasruddin’s wife has a bad memory, I have a marvellous
memory. I forget everything. And I enjoy this forgetfulness; I am not
worried about it.</p><p>Secondly: I am an ignorant person. I am not a scholar. I enjoy
reading books, but I read the Bible. the Gita, the Koran just as one
reads novels; they are ancient, beautiful stories. Krishnamurti says he
never reads any scripture; he reads only detective stories. I read the
scripture, but I read in the scripture just the detective story and
nothing else. And I would suggest to Krishnamurti that it would be good
if he should look into the Bible; you cannot find a more beautiful story
full of suspense. Everything is there: love. Life, murder; everything is
there. It is very sensational.</p><p><br></p><p>Scriptures, to me, have nothing special. Scriptures are as sacred as
the trees and the rocks and the stars – or as secular. I don’t make a
distinction so I am not very serious about scriptures. The only thing I
am serious about is jokes. So when I quote the scripture I quote from
memory, when I quote a joke I have it written here in front of me. I
never want to make any mistake about the joke – I am really serious.
About everything else I am absolutely non-serious.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is very obvious. Listening to me you must have understood it.
that my emphasis is not on what the scriptures say – that is not the
point: my emphasis is on what I am saying. If you go to a Christian
priest, he quotes the scripture, his emphasis is on the scripture. He is
very literal. he has to be – he himself is secondary, the scripture is
primary. He is a witness to the scripture. With me it is just the
opposite: the scripture is just a witness to me. Whatsoever I have to
say, only that have I to say. If I feel the scripture can be a witness
to it, I use it.</p><p><br></p><p>And I go on playing with the scripture, sometimes in one way,
sometimes in another. Remember always, I am not trying to prove the
scripture – that the scripture is right – I am simply using it as
illustration. It is secondary, you can forget about it: nothing will be
lost. Whatsoever I am saying is direct. Just to help you, because you
are not capable of listening to the direct truth, you need a few
witnesses. So Jesus, Krishna and Buddha and Lao Tzu and Lieh Tzu – they
are just witnesses to me. I am not to adjust with them. they have to
adjust with me.</p><p><br></p><p>And this should always be so: the dead should exist and adjust with
the living and for the living. Why should the living adjust with the
dead? Lieh Tzu has to adjust with me, because only in adjusting with me
can Lieh Tzu again have a little life. Jesus has to adjust with me, I am
not to adjust with Jesus. The past has to adjust with the present. not
otherwise. So I go on playing.…</p><p><br></p><p>These are all just stories to me and. deep down, this is the
approach: the whole of life is a fiction, it is MAYA, it is a dream.
Jesus and Buddha and Krishna and I and you are parts of a big dream –
God is dreaming. Don’t be too serious about it. Scholars become too
serious. I am not a scholar and I have no respect for scholars. In fact
my attitude is exactly the same as Mulla Nasruddin’s.</p><p><br></p><p>Once it happened:</p><p><br></p><p>A man came to Mulla Nasruddin and said ‘Nasruddin. have you heard?
The great scholar of the town has died and twenty rupees are needed to
bury him.’</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla gave him a hundred rupee note and said ‘Take it, and while you
are doing it, why not bury five? Remember, these scholars are very
calculating and cunning people – bury them as deep as possible,
otherwise they will come back. And if you need more money, come to me,
don’t be shy about it!’</p><p>I am neither a scholar nor am I in any way respectful towards
scholars or scholarship. That is all bullshit.</p><p><br></p><p>I was reading a beautiful poem by E.Y. Harburg. A few lines are of
tremendous import. Meditate over them.</p><p><br></p><p>Poems are made by fools like me, But only God can make a tree; And
only God who makes the tree Also makes the fools like me.</p><p>But only fools like me, you see,</p><p><br></p><p>Can make a God, who makes a tree.</p><p><br></p><p>I am tremendously ignorant, and I am happy as I am. and I have no
idea to improve upon myself. So if sometimes you are in an awkward
situation: somebody says that Osho has said this and this is not
correct, it is your problem. Then your Master is found faulty... you
feel a little disturbed, your ego is hurt. As far as I am concerned I am
perfectly okay. And I will continue to create problems for you! Now you
find the answers. Invent something, be a little imaginative or
inventive. When I can invent so much, why can’t you? You can find some
esoteric, occult meaning in it. It is always easy: when you cannot find
anything else, always try to find some esoteric, occult meaning in it –
there must be.</p><p><br></p><p>The handsome, well-dressed man handed the poor beggar a five dollar
bill. ‘Here, my good man’ he said ‘eat your fill and there’s enough for
a drink or two.’</p><p><br></p><p>The beggar entered Tony’s restaurant, where he ate the biggest dinner
of his life and then topped it off with a bottle of wine and a big tip
to Luigi, the waiter. ‘Ah’ said the handsome, well-dressed stranger
‘it’s a good world. Everyone is happy. The poor beggar because he is no
longer hungry, Tony because he has made a big sale, the waiter because
he has received a nice tip. And me?... l’m happy too, because the bill
was counterfeit.’</p><p><br></p><p>So make everybody happy. Create a few fictions, a few counterfeit
bills; make everybody happy. The world is really beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be bothered too much about facts there are none, all are
fictions. Remember, ALL are fictions, even my being here and your being
here is a tremendous fiction. Nothing ever happens. Truth is. All that
happens is fictitious; history is a fiction because whatsoever is, is...
nothing ever happens there. God has no history and God has no biography.
God only is, there is no ‘was’ and there is no ‘will be’. There is no
past and no future.</p><p><br></p><p>All history is fictitious. That’s why in the East we have never been
bothered by history, we have not written history at all – instead of
history we have written myths. If you ask when Rama was born, Hindus
cannot answer. Ask Hindus, and you will find as many answers as the
persons you ask.</p><p>Nobody knows, in fact nobody knows exactly whether he was born or
not. The fiction is that the story writer who wrote the story of Rama,
wrote it before Rama was born: Balmiki wrote it before Rama was born.
Look at the Eastern approach. You cannot conceive of it, that the
Christian apostles should write the story of Jesus before he was ever
born. But Balmiki wrote the story of Rama before he was born and then
Rama had to be born to prove that Balmiki was right, otherwise people
would laugh at this old man. And he had written so, ‘So do it!’ So he
had to do the things that Balmiki had written already. He had prophesied
it, it was a prediction, and then Rama followed. Look at the approach:
history is thought of as fiction. Only novels are written first, then
you can play, you can make a movie out of them.</p><p><br></p><p>In the secret traditions of the Essenes it is said that Christ never
was, that in fact it was a drama, a Christ drama, that had been played
for centuries before Christ was ever born. In fact he was never born, it
was just a drama. By and by, people became so much attached to the
drama, they started loving the drama so much, that it turned out
becoming a reality; it started looking like a fact. That’s why there are
so many versions. If you look into the four gospels, all are different,
sometimes contradictory. Four persons writing the same story are bound
to be different.</p><p><br></p><p>The Eastern way of looking at things is that whatsoever is cannot be
seen by the eyes. And whatsoever can be seen by the eyes is just a
fiction – enjoy while you are seeing it, love it – it is LEELA, God’s
play. So when I am saying things to you, these are not sermons – a
sermon is a serious thing – these are just like the songs of the birds.
So whatsoever surfaces in me, I tell you; and I am not worried whether
it is proved by history or not because history itself is meaningless to
me.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>WHY HAS THERE NEVER BEEN A SINGLE WOMAN ENLIGHTENED MASTER?</p><p><br></p><p>A woman cannot be a Master – it is not possible. When a woman arrives
she becomes a Mistress, not a Master. The fulfilment of a woman is love.
The flowering of a woman is love. Mastery is not the goal of the
feminine mind; they don’t become Masters, they become Mistresses. To be
a Master is basically a male effort.</p><p><br></p><p>Awareness is the way of man, love is the way Or woman.</p><p><br></p><p>On the path of awareness it is possible to teach; one can become a
Master. On the path of love, how can you teach love? You can flower, you
can bloom in love, but how can you teach it? Yes, if somebody wants to
learn from you, he will learn it, but you will not be a Master. And such
women have existed: Rabiya, Meera, Mallibai, Magdalen, Teresa. Such
women have existed: Sahajo, Daya, Lalla. Many women have existed, but
they were not Masters. They were so surrendered to God that they became
Mistresses.</p><p><br></p><p>Meera says ‘I am a mistress to you. My Lord’ – a mistress to Krishna,
to God himself. She sings the song of the glory of her Lord, she dances.
If somebody can catch something from her, it is overflowing; but she
cannot be a teacher. She is surrendered, her surrender is absolute. Yes,
if you are in her company, you will learn what surrender is... but you
will have to learn, she will not teach. A woman cannot be a teacher.</p><p>To teach, a certain different quality of energy is needed. Let me say
it in this way, this is my experience: it is very difficult for a man to
become a disciple, very difficult for a man to become a disciple. Even
if he becomes, he becomes reluctantly. Surrender is difficult. How to
surrender the will? Even if he surrenders, he only surrenders
conditionally, in order to become a Master one day. He becomes a
disciple in order to become a Master. It is difficult for a man to
surrender; it is very simple for a woman to surrender. It is very simple
for a woman to become a disciple, it is very difficult for a woman to
become a Master. Even after she has arrived, she remains surrendered.
And for the man, even when he has not arrived, he remains deep down
unsurrendered. On the surface he will show surrender, but deep down
somewhere the ego persists.</p><p><br></p><p>A man can become a good Master. A woman can become a good disciple
because to become a disciple means to become a receiver, to be
receptive, to become a womb. To become a Master means to become a
giver.</p><p><br></p><p>The same phenomenon continues... as it is there on the biological
level, it remains on the spiritual level. Biologically, a woman is ready
to receive the sperm from the man she loves. The man cannot become a
mother, he can only become a father. He can trigger the process: the
woman will become the mother, she will carry the child in her womb for
nine months, she will nourish the child with her blood and her being,
she will be carrying the pregnancy. The same happens on the spiritual
level too.</p><p><br></p><p>When a woman comes to a Master she is immediately ready to surrender.
If sometimes it happens otherwise – sometimes there are women who are
very reluctant to surrender that simply shows they have lost contact
with their womanhood. They don’t know who they are, they have become
distracted from their centre. They don’t know how to surrender because
they don’t know how to be a woman. If you know how to be a woman, if you
are a woman, surrender is so simple, it comes so easily.</p><p><br></p><p>All the great disciples in the world were women. Buddha had thousands
of disciples, but the proportion has always been the same: three women,
one man. So was the proportion with Mahavir. He had forty thousand
sannyasins: ten thousand men, thirty thousand women. And so was the case
with Jesus.</p><p><br></p><p>The really devoted people around him were not the men but the women.
When he was crucified, all the men escaped, there was not a single man.
All those so-called ‘apostles’ had all disappeared, but the women were
there. Three women were there: they had no fear, they were ready to
sacrifice themselves. When Jesus was taken down from the cross, it was
not by men – those disciples had gone far away, and one or two were
there but they were hiding in the crowd women took down the body. And it
is very significant that when Jesus appeared after three days,
resurrected, he appeared first to Mary Magdalen, not to a man. This is
very significant. Why? What about those twelve apostles? Why to Mary
Magdalen? And she immediately recognised him, and she rushed to him and
she said ‘So, My Lord, you are still alive!’ And when Jesus appeared to
the disciples, male disciples, they would not recognise him, they
thought ‘It seems tricky. How can this man come back?’</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that when he appeared before two disciples, male
disciples, he walked with them for hours and they would not recognise
him. And they continued talking about Jesus and Jesus was walking</p><p>by their side. They were a little puzzled about the appearance of
this man – he looked like Jesus but how could he be? ‘Just appearance? –
one should not be deceived by appearance alone.’ For two hours they
walked together. When they went to an inn, all three sat there to eat
their dinner and when Jesus broke his bread, THEN they recognised. Very
materialistic mind. Suddenly they saw... because Jesus’ every act, his
every gesture, was his, authentically his. Now they recognised because
he was breaking the bread in the same way that they had seen Jesus break
bread for years – then they recognised. But for two hours, the presence
was not recognised. Magdalen recognised immediately. When she went to
tell the male disciples that Jesus was resurrected, they laughed. They
said ‘Woman, you are hallucinating.’ And they laughed and they said
‘This is how women always are – imaginative, dreaming, romantic. Now
look at this foolish woman. Jesus is dead. We have seen him die on the
cross with our own eyes.’ But she cried and she said ‘Listen to me. I
have seen him.’ But they would not listen.</p><p>A woman can be a perfect disciple, and this is how it should be.
Woman is receptive, an opening, a womb. They have never been Masters in
the sense that men have been Masters – like Mahavir, Buddha,
Zarathustra, Lao Tzu. No, they have never been Masters like that. But
there have never been disciples like women; no man has ever been able to
equal them as far as disciplehood is concerned. And let me tell you
this, that as far as this division of male and female is concerned, the
female mind is more blessed. Because the real thing is to receive the
truth, the real thing is not to give it that is secondary. And a woman
is always more total than a man. Whenever she receives the truth, she
becomes luminous: her whole body, her whole being shows it; she carries
an aura. Have you not seen a woman who is pregnant, how beautiful she
becomes? Her face glows, she is carrying a new life within her. And this
is nothing compared to a woman who really becomes a disciple. She is
carrying God himself within her. Her glory is infinite.</p><p>So don’t be worried why women don’t become Masters. There is no need.
If you can become disciples, that is natural and you will always remain
true to nature.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5</p><p><br></p><p>YESTERDAY YOU SAID THAT ZEN IS THE BEAUTIFUL RESULT OF MELTING TAO
AND BUDDHISM, AND SUFISM THE FLOWER THAT BLOOMS OUT OF ISLAM AND
HINDUISM. IS YOUR TEACHING THE SUPER-FLOWER, THE CROSS-BREEDING BETWEEN
ZEN AND SUFISM?</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a flower, it is just a meeting of two fragrances. Zen is a
superflower, so is Sufism. Nothing can be added to them; they are
perfect. As far as flowers are concerned, they have attained to
perfection; nothing more can be added to them, they have bloomed. What I
am doing here is trying to fuse their fragrances.</p><p><br></p><p>A rose has flowered and so has flowered a lotus. Both arc spreading
their fragrances to the wind. What I am doing here is trying to fuse
their fragrance, which is a very subtle phenomenon. A flower is gross,
fragrance is subtle. A flower is visible, fragrance is invisible. A
flower is material, fragrance is simply spiritual. That’s what I am
doing here trying to bring together all the flowers of Tantra, of Yoga,
of Tao, of Sufism, of Zen, of Hasidism, Jews, Moslems. Hindus,
Buddhists. Jains-l am trying to bring together all the fragrances that
have been released down the centuries. This is a great experiment which
has never been done before. Buddha is concerned only with the path
through which he has attained. so is Mahavir, so is Jesus. Never before
on the earth – has this been done.</p><p>You are blessed, you are fortunate. You may not realise this right
now, nobody realises it when the moment is alive. Have you ever thought
about it? Were Jesus’ disciples aware of what was happening when it was
happening? Were they aware that something of tremendous import was
happening in their lives which was going to decide the destiny of
humanity for centuries to come? No, they were not aware. Were Buddha’s
disciples aware that something of great import was happening You are
also not aware. Something of tremendous import is happening which has
not happened ever, which is going to be decisive, because now the old
religions cannot survive in the future; their days are gone.</p><p><br></p><p>In the future, a few things will disappear. Nations will have to
disappear because the earth has become a small village; now they are
meaningless. India and Pakistan and China and America and Canada and
England and Germany are meaningless; the earth has become one. The day
man became capable of going beyond gravitation, the earth became one.
The first man in a spaceship started crying when he saw the whole earth
as one. Nobody had ever seen the whole earth as one. He looked at the
earth he could not believe how there could be any divisions of America
and Russia and China and this and that. He could not think about himself
as American or Russian. He could think about himself only as an
earth-dweller. And he could not see any divisions of the earth because
divisions are only on the political maps; the earth remains undivided.
The day man crossed the barrier of gravitation, became free from
gravitation, the earth became one. It is now only a question of
time<span class=s4></span>Nations will have to disappear, and with
nations will disappear the world</p><p>of the politicians and the world of politics. A great nightmare will
disappear from the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>And the second thing to disappear with the nations is Hinduism,
Mohammedanism, Christianity, Judaism. Just as politics have divided the
map of the earth, religions have divided the consciousness of man
Certainly the division of religion is more dangerous than the division
of politics, because politics can only divide the earth... religions
have divided the consciousness of man. Man has not been allowed total
access to his being. One has to be just a Mohammedan – a very narrow
thing. One has to be just a Hindu – just a very narrow thing. Why. when
you can have the whole heritage? When the whole past is yours and the
whole future is yours, why should you divide? Why should I call myself
‘a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Christian’? One should claim the total. By
claiming the total you become total: you lose all narrow divisions,
distinctions, you become whole. you become holy. That is going to
happen, that is bound to happen. That HAS to happen. otherwise man will
not be able to grow any more.</p><p><br></p><p>This is very crucial that man has to drop all barriers.of nation and
religion and church. That’s what I am doing here: trying to bring
together all the fragrances released in different centuries by differing
flowerings of human consciousness. Lao Tzu is a flower, so is Buddha, so
is Jesus, so is Mohammed, but now we have to melt all their fragrances
into one – a universal fragrance. Then, for the first time, man will be
able to be religious and yet undivided. Then the church is yours and the
mosque too and the temple too. Then the Gita is yours, and the Koran and
the Vedas and the Bible – everything is yours. You become vast.</p><p><br></p><p>No, I am not trying to create a new flower – flowers have happened. I
am trying to create a new perfume out of all those flowers. It is more
subtle, more invisible; only those who have eyes will be able to see
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 6</p><p>THE DANGER OF YOUR TALKS ON TAOISM IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF LAZY,
IRRESPONSIBLE PEOPLE AROUND WHO RATIONALISE THEIR BAD HABITS BY CLAIMING
TO BE INACTIVE TAOISTS. PLEASE CLARIFY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TAOIST
AND A LAZY ESCAPIST.</p><p><br></p><p>The question is from Anand Prem.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing, there are two dangers I have talked about: one is of
egoism, another is of lethargy, laziness. And remember, if you have to
fall into any trap, the trap of laziness is better than the trap of
egoism. That is more dangerous, because the lazy person has never done
anything wrong, a lazy person cannot do. He will never do any good –
okay, but he will never do any wrong either. He will not bother to kill
anybody, to torture anybody, to create concentration camps, to go to war
he will not bother. He says ‘Why? When one can rest, why?’ A lazy person
is not naturally a danger. The only thing that he may miss may be his
own spiritual growth, but he will not interfere with anybody else’s
growth; he will not be an interference. He will not be a do-gooder and
these are the greatest, most mischievous people in the world the
do-gooders. A lazy person is almost absent. What can he do? Have you
ever heard of any lazy person doing anything wrong?</p><p><br></p><p>No, Anand Prem, the real problem comes from the egoist, and that is
Anand Prem’s possibility. Don’t be worried about a few people here
getting lazy – let them, nothing is wrong. The real problem is from the
egoist; one who wants to be spiritual, one who wants to be special, one
who wants to become a SIDDHA, one who wants to attain spiritual powers.
One wants to prove something spiritually in the world: that is the real
danger. If you have to fall, choose laziness. If you cannot fall, if you
have to avoid, good to avoid BOTH.</p><p><br></p><p>Laziness is just like the common cold – nothing much to worry about.
Ego is like cancer. It is better not to have either. But if you have to
choose and you would like to have something to cling to, the common cold
is good – you can depend on it, it never kills anybody, it has never
killed anybody. But never choose cancer, and that is the greater
possibility.</p><p><br></p><p>Now she asks ‘The danger of your talks on Taoism is that there are a
lot of lazy, irresponsible people...’.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing: the moment you start thinking about others you are
getting into an ego-trip. Who are you to think about others and their
life? It is their life. If they feel like being lazy, who are you to
interfere? Anand Prem has a do-gooder in her being; she is very worried
about others – that is a dangerous thing. And of course she is
condemnatory. This question has a condemnation: ‘The danger of your
talks on Taoism is that there a lot of lazy, irresponsible people around
who rationalise their bad habits by claiming to be inactive Taoists.’
Who are you to tell them that their habits are bad?</p><p><br></p><p>Laziness is a better habit than to be obsessed by activity. To be
obsessed by activity is madness. A lazy person can be sane. Sometimes
the laziest people have been found to be the sanest. I have the feeling
that if Anand Prem comes across Lao Tzu, she will think he is lazy. He
will look lazy to all purposes. If she comes across Diogenes, she will
think he is lazy. If she comes around Buddha she will think he is lazy.
Sitting under the Bodhi Tree...’what are you doing? At least you can run
a primary school and teach children, or you can open a hospital and
serve ill people. So many people are dying, starving... what are you
doing here sitting under the Bodhi Tree?’</p><p>Anand Prem would have jumped upon Buddha and taken him to task. ‘What
are you doing? Just sitting, meditating? Is this the time to meditate?
Is this the time to be just sitting silently and enjoying your bliss?
This is selfish!’ This condemnatory attitude is really dangerous: it
gives you an idea of holier than thou, ‘I am better than you. You... you
lazy people!’ She goes on writing questions every day that I have not
been answering; every day – that ‘these people are hippies, these people
are useless.’</p><p><br></p><p>She is in search of a lover, but she cannot find one here because she
thinks that nobody here.… She wants a ‘straight person’ and she cannot
find a straight person here. These are all ‘hippies and yippies’ and she
wants somebody who is well-established. She wrote a letter. ‘...
well-established, has a bank account, is a gentleman, a squire, has
prestige, respectability. Here these people are just hobos, wanderers,
vagabonds.’ She would have refused Buddha, she would have refused Lao
Tzu: they were not straight. She writes to me: ‘... these long-haired
people!’ With such disgust she writes, and because of this disgust she
has become a very disgusting person and she will not find. For one year
she has been in the West in search. She is a Jew. First she searched in
America, then she went to Israel to search for a man. She could not find
in America, she could not find in Israel – she will never find anywhere.
Even if she goes to heaven, God will look like a hobo. She has such
condemnatory attitudes that she cannot love a simple human being. Yes,
there are flaws, there are limitations, but everybody has those
limitations. If you want to love, you have to love a man with all his
limitations.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot find a perfect person. Perfection does not exist. God
never allows perfection because perfection is so monotonous. Just think:
living with a perfect person... twenty-four hours, and you will commit
suicide. Living with a perfect person? Then how will you live? He will
be more like a marble statue, dead. The moment a person becomes perfect,
he is dead. An alive person is never perfect, and my teaching is
basically not for perfection but for totality.</p><p><br></p><p>Be total, and remember the difference. The ideal of perfection says:
Be like this – no anger, no jealousy, no possessiveness, no flaws, no
limitations. The ideal of totality is totally different: If you are
angry, be totally angry. If you are loving, be totally loving. If you
are sad, be totally sad. Nothing is denied – only partiality has to be
dropped, and then a person becomes beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>A total person is beautiful. A perfect person is dead.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not trying to create MAHATMAS here. Enough! Those MAHATMAS have
done enough nonsense in the world. We need beautiful people, flowering,
flowing, alive. Yes, they will be sometimes sad, but what is wrong in
being sad? Sometimes they will be angry, but what is wrong in sometimes
being angry? It simply shows that you are alive, that you are not a dead
thing, that you are not driftwood. Sometimes you fight, sometimes you
let go. Just like climates change: it is rainy sometimes and it is
cloudy, and sometimes it is sunny and the clouds have disappeared. And
all seasons are needed – the cold, the heat, the winter, the summer –
all seasons are needed. And a real man, an authentic man, has all the
climates in his being – only with one awareness: that whatsoever he is
doing he should do totally and should do with full awareness – enough,
that’s enough, and you have a beautiful person.</p><p>But Anand Prem is in search of a perfect man. I have heard.…</p><p>Once a man travelled all over the world.… Whenever I look at Anand
Prem, I again and again remember that man, He travelled all over the
world in search of a perfect woman. He wanted to get married, but how to
accept an imperfect model? – he wanted a perfect woman. He came back,
his whole life wasted; he could not find. Then one day a friend said
‘But now you are seventy and you searched your whole life, couldn’t you
find a single perfect woman?’</p><p><br></p><p>He said ‘Yes, once I came across one woman who was perfect.’ So the
friend asked ‘Then what happened?’</p><p>But the man became sad, he said ‘What happened? That woman was in
search of a perfect man, so nothing happened!’</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, the ideal of perfection is an egoistic ideal.</p><p><br></p><p>Ronald Coleman told Herb Stein about a Hollywood phony who spoke with
a fake Oxford accent, wore a fake Purple Star and Phi Beta Kappa key –
and worst of all, passed a lot of fake cheques. At the end of his rope,
he decided to commit suicide, and went down to the Santa Fe railroad
tracks. He calmly smoked several imported cigarettes while three or four
heavy freights puffed by. A tramp who was watching jeered. ‘lf you’re
gonna do it, why don’t you do it?’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Don’t be vulgar’ squelched the phony. ‘A man like me waits for the
Super Chief.’</p><p><br></p><p>Even if an egoist goes to commit suicide, he waits for the Super
Chief, the best train. He says ‘Don’t be vulgar. A man like me waits for
the Super Chief.’ Even if he is committing suicide, he will not commit
under a goods train.</p><p><br></p><p>Marriage is like suicide – you can commit anywhere. You should not
wait for the Super Chief. Anand Prem is in search and it is impossible
for her, the way she looks at things with such condemnation, to find
anybody whom she can love.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Please clarify the difference between a Taoist and a lazy
escapist.’</p><p><br></p><p>There is not much, and if there is, it is so inner that only the
person will know – you will never be able to judge from the outside.
Look at me. I am also a lazy person. Have you seen me doing anything,
ever? It is very difficult from the outside to know. And I love lazy
persons... Taoists or not; I love lazy persons because out of lazy
persons never any Adolf Hitler is born, never any Genghis Khan, never
any Tamburlaine. Lazy people have silently lived their lives and
disappeared, without leaving any trace on history, without contaminating
humanity. They have not polluted consciousness. They were here as if
they were not. To be lazy and aware... and you have become a Taoist. It
does not mean that you become inactive. It simply means that the
obsessive activity disappears. It simply means that you have become
capable of not-doing too.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said about a Zen Master that a person asked one of his
disciples ‘What miracles can your Master do?’</p><p><br></p><p>And the disciple said ‘Are you a follower of somebody?’</p><p>And the man said ‘Yes, I am a follower of a certain Master and he is
a great-miracle-man; he can do great miracles. Once it happened that I
was standing on this shore of the bank and he was standing on the other
shore, and he shouted to me “I want to write something in your book.”
And it was almost a half-mile-wide river. So I took my book out, raised
it, and from the other shore he started writing with his fountain pen
and the writing came on my book. This miracle I have seen and the book
is with me – you can see.’</p><p><br></p><p>And the disciple of the other Master laughed and he said ‘My Master
can do greater miracles.’ So the man said ‘What miracles?’</p><p>And the disciple said ‘My Master can do miracles, and he is so
capable... SO CAPABLE that he is capable of not doing them too.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Not doing them too.’ See the beauty of it. He is ‘so capable... SO
CAPABLE... of not doing them too.’</p><p><br></p><p>A Taoist is a man who does only that which is absolutely necessary.
His life is almost like a telegram. When you go to the Post Office you
don’t write a long letter when you are giving a telegraphic message. You
go on cutting words, this and this can be dropped and then you come to
ten or nine or whatsoever. If you write a letter you will never write
only ten words. And have you watched the thing? A telegram is more
expressive than all letters. It says much more in very few words. The
unnecessary is dropped, only the most necessary is there. A Taoist is
telegraphic, his life is like a telegram. The obsessive, the
unnecessary, the feverish, has been dropped. He does only that which is
absolutely necessary. And let me tell you that the absolutely necessary
is so little that you will see a Taoist almost as if he were lazy.</p><p><br></p><p>But remember, I am not praising laziness. I am simply condemning the
egoistic attitude. Against ego – I am for laziness. But I am not for
laziness itself; it should be full of awareness. Then you pass from
activity and from laziness both. Then you become transcendental. You are
neither active, nor inactive; you are centred. Whatsoever is needed you
do it, whatsoever is not needed you don’t do it. You are neither a doer
nor a non-doer. Doing is no more your focus. You are a
consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>So please don’t take whatsoever I have said in the sense that I am
helping you to be lazy. To be REALLY lazy means not to be inactive, but
to be so full of energy that you are a reservoir of energy. Lazy as far
as the world is concerned, but tremendously dynamic inside, not
dull.</p><p><br></p><p>A Taoist is lazy from the outside; from the inside he has become a
river-like phenomenon, he is continuously flowing towards the ocean. He
has dropped many activities because they were unnecessarily leaking his
energy. The danger is always there – in whatsoever I say there is danger
– the danger of interpretation. If I say ‘Be active’, there is the
possibility that you will become egoists. If I say ‘Be inactive’, there
is the possibility that you may become dull. Man is very cunning.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard.…</p><p><br></p><p>He was the kind of a guy who would bet on anything – provided he was
sure of winning. ‘I’ll bet my wife’s first words will be “my dear” when
I get home’ he said to Lucky.</p><p>Lucky took him up on it. He knew his wife very well and she would be
the last woman in the world to say ‘my dear’.</p><p><br></p><p>Must have been like Anand Prem.</p><p><br></p><p>Lucky took him up on it and they bet a hundred dollars. When they got
to the sport’s house he stuck his head in the door and called ‘My dear,
I’m home.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘“My dear” be hanged!’ roared his wife. ‘Wait till I get you
inside!’</p><p><br></p><p>And he looked at Lucky and said ‘Give me a hundred dollars. Didn’t I
tell you that the first words she would ever utter would be “my
dear”?’</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is very cunning. The wife is saying ‘“My dear” be hanged I wait
till I get you inside!’ But you can interpret... so he is demanding a
hundred dollars. Mind is cunning. It goes on interpreting in its own
ways; it goes on finding reasons, rationalisations, tricks to defend. It
wants to remain as it is. That is the whole effort of the mind: it wants
to remain as it is. If it is lazy, it wants to remain lazy. If it is
active – too active, obsessively active it wants to remain active. So
whatsoever I say, you have to be careful not to defend your mind. You
have to come out of your mind.</p><p><br></p><p>The man burst angrily through the door, threw his wife off the
stranger’s knee and angrily demanded ‘How do I find you kissing my
wife?’</p><p><br></p><p>‘I don’t know’ said the stranger. ‘Maybe you’re home early?’</p><p><br></p><p>People can find reasons. Be alert. And be alert about your own self,
not about others. This is none of your business what others are doing.
This should be one of the basic attitudes of a religious person – not to
think about what the other is doing; that is his life. If he decides to
live it that way, that is his business. Who are you even to have an
opinion about it? Even to have an opinion means that you are ready to
interfere, you have already interfered. A religious person is one who is
trying to live his life the best, the most total way he can; the most
alert way that he can he is trying. And he is not interfering with
anybody’s life, not even by having an opinion. Have you watched,
observed? If you pass somebody and you have a certain opinion about him,
your face changes, your eyes change, your attitude, your walk. If you
are condemnatory, your whole being starts broadcasting condemnation,
disgust. No, you are interfering.</p><p><br></p><p>To be really religious means to be non-interfering. Give freedom to
people; freedom is their birthright.</p><p><br></p><p>Once it happened, I stayed with one of my professors, my teachers.
Though I was a student and he was my teacher, he was very respectful of
me. He was a rare, religious man but he was a drunkard, and when I
stayed in his home, he was very afraid to drink in front of me. What
would I think? I watched him, I felt his restlessness, so the next day I
told him ‘There is something on your mind. If you don’t relax, I will
immediately leave and go to a hotel; I will not stay. There is something
on your mind. I feel that you are not at ease, my presence is creating
some trouble.’</p><p><br></p><p>He said ’Since you have raised the problem, I would like to tell you.
I have never told you that I drink too much, but I always drink in my
home and go to sleep. Now that you are staying here I don’t want</p><p>to drink before you and that is creating the trouble. I cannot remain
without drinking but I cannot even conceive of drinking in front of
you.’</p><p><br></p><p>I laughed. I said ‘This is foolish. What have I to do with it? You
will not force me to drink.’ He said ‘No, never.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Then it is finished; the problem is solved. You drink and I will
keep you company. I will not drink but I can drink something else
Coca-Cola or Fanta, I will keep you company, you drink. I can fill your
glass, I can help you.’</p><p><br></p><p>He could not believe it, he thought I was joking. But when in the
night I filled his glass, he started crying. He said ‘I had never
thought that you would not have any opinion about it. And I have been
watching you’ he said ‘and you don’t have any opinion about my drinking,
about my behaviour, about what I am doing.’</p><p><br></p><p>I said ‘To have an opinion about you is simply foolish. It is not
something very great that I haven’t any opinion about you. Why should I
have in the first place? Who am l? It is your life – you want to drink,
you drink.’</p><p><br></p><p>To have an opinion about you means that deep down somewhere I want to
manipulate you. To have some opinion about you, this way or that, means
that I have a deep desire to be powerful over people. That’s what a
politician is. A religious person should be non-interfering.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 7</p><p><br></p><p>YOU SPEAK A LOT ABOUT THE UGLINESS OF JEALOUSY. YES, IT IS QUITE
UGLY, BUT ANY SUGGESTIONS TO US SUFFERERS OF THE DISEASE WHO AREN’T
ENLIGHTENED ON HOW TO DIMINISH IT?</p><p><br></p><p>First, diminishing it is not going to help. You can diminish it to
such proportions that it will almost become invisible, but that is not
going to help. Diminishing simply means that you are throwing it into
the unconscious and it goes into your basement of being more and more
deeply. It becomes invisible. You may not be able to see it, but it will
go on working from the back, it will go on pulling your strings from the
back. It will become more subtle. Please don’t try to diminish it.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing to remember: rather than diminish it, magnify it so
you can see the whole of it. That is the whole process of all the groups
going on around here – Gestalt, Encounter, Psychodrama. The whole
process is that whatsoever the problem is, please don’t diminish it but
magnify it. Bring it totally as it is – even exaggerate it so that you
can see every detail of it. Down the centuries in the past, jealousy,
anger, sadness, this and that, all have been repressed. The effort was
to diminish it. No, a seed is a diminished tree, but a seed is
tremendously powerful. A seed can at any time again produce a tree. The
right situation, the right season... and the tree will again sprout. You
can diminish your jealousy, it can become just a seed, and you will not
be able to see it the tree has disappeared, but it is there.</p><p><br></p><p>Diminishing is not the right process. That’s what you have been
doing, that’s what you have done to your life: you have diminished
everything. And one thing more. When you diminish jealousy, your</p><p>love will be diminished alongside, because your love and jealousy are
so much entangled with each other. If you diminish your sadness, your
happiness will be diminished, because your happiness and sadness are so
much together. If you diminish your hate, your love will disappear –
that’s what has happened. You have been taught not to hate and the total
result is that you have become incapable of love.</p><p><br></p><p>No, please don’t diminish anything. That is not the way. Rather,
magnify, exaggerate, bring it to its total blossoming and then see it –
every detail of it, every minute detail of it. In that very awareness,
in that very seeing, you will become capable of transcending it and then
there will be no need to do anything about it.</p><p><br></p><p>The second thing: you say ‘You speak a lot about the ugliness of
jealousy. Yes, it is ugly...’. No, you don’t know. You are simply
repeating what I have been saying. If you know it is quite ugly, in that
very knowing it will disappear. You don’t know. You have listened to me,
you have listened to Jesus, you have listened to Buddha and you have
gathered opinions. You don’t know. It is not your own feel that jealousy
is ugly. If it is your own feel, why should you carry it? It is not an
easy thing, it takes a lot of investment. To be jealous is a very
difficult thing: it needs a lot of effort on your part, a lot of
involvement. It is so destructive of your own self that if it is ugly
and you have known the ugliness of it, you cannot carry it for a single
moment. But listening to me you become knowledgeable.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard...</p><p><br></p><p>‘You can’t come in here’ the worried mother warned ‘my son is
sick.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘I want to catch your son’s measles’ the man said ‘because if I
kissed the nurse she’d get it. She would kiss the doctor and he’d get
it. The doctor would kiss my wife and she’d get it. My wife would kiss
the landlord and that’s the guy I’m after.’</p><p><br></p><p>It is a great investment, a great effort and a very complex
phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>And finally, it may destroy. It may not destroy others – it certainly
destroys you; it is suicidal. Not only that it is ugly, it is poisonous;
it is suicidal, it is killing yourself every day, slowly, slowly.</p><p><br></p><p>See the fact of it. Don’t just become knowledgeable. What I say will
not become an experience for you unless YOU experience it. And what is
the way to experience it? The way is to bring it in front of you. It is
hiding behind you.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t just become knowledgeable. What I say will not become an
experience for you unless YOU experience it. And what is the way to
experience it? The way is to bring it in front of you. It is hiding
behind you.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t repress it, express it. Sit in your room, close the doors,
bring your jealousy into focus. Watch it, see it, let it take as strong
a flame as possible. Let it become a strong flame, burn into it and see
what it is. And don’t from the very beginning say that this is ugly,
because that very idea that this is ugly will repress it, will not allow
it total expression. No opinions! Just try to see the existential effect
of what jealousy is, the existential fact. No interpretations, no
ideologies! Forget Buddhas and work, forget me. Just let the jealousy be
there. Look into it, look deeply into it and so do with anger, so</p><p>do with sadness, hatred, possessiveness. And by and by you will see
that just by seeing through things you start getting a transcendental
feeling that you are JUst a witness; the identity is broken. The
identity is broken only when you encounter something within you.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 8</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT DO YOU SAY TO SOMEONE WHO, NO MATTER WHAT PATHS YOU TALK ABOUT,
ALWAYS FEELS THAT HE HAS ONE FOOT ON EACH OF THEM? AND DON’T SAY THAT
THIS MUST BE MY PATH! YOU ONLY MENTIONED TWO YESTERDAY, REMEMBER? DID I
JUST PUT MY FOOT IN IT?</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot put, by the very nature of it. Those paths are so
diametrically opposite that you cannot put one foot on one path, the
other foot on another path – that is impossible. You must be imagining,
you must be dreaming, hallucinating. It is so diametrically opposite –
just as you cannot be alive and dead together. If you think you are
both, you are simply alive and nothing else, because even to think one
has to be alive.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said Mulla Nasruddin once asked.…</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody had died and he rushed home and asked his wife ‘You are very
wise, just tell me one thing: if some day I die, how am I to decide
whether I have really died or not? I have seen somebody die, one day or
other I am going to die. but how will I know?’</p><p><br></p><p>The wife said ‘Don’t be foolish, you will know it. You will become
cold.’</p><p><br></p><p>So, one day it happened. He was cutting wood in the forest, and it
was a very cold day and he started feeling cold. He said ‘Okay, so the
last day has come. So I am becoming cold.’ So he said good-bye to his
donkey – because only the donkey was there – and thinking that he was
going to die, he made himself comfortable under the tree, closed his
eyes.… What else to do? Of course, when he closed his eyes, lying down
under the tree, he became even more cold. So he said ‘Certain... death
is certain; now it is coming. I am becoming more and more cold.’</p><p><br></p><p>Then, just out of curiosity, he opened one of his eyes and looked at
the donkey... what was happening to the donkey? And a wolf had attacked
the donkey! So he said ‘What can I do?’ But still he said loudly ‘You
can take freedom with my donkey because I am dead. If I had been alive I
would have shown you! But what can I do now?’</p><p><br></p><p>Talking, thinking, how can you be dead? Even to think this much is
enough proof that you are alive.</p><p><br></p><p>No, you must have misunderstood. You cannot be on both paths. Look
again. It is possible you may not be on either, but you cannot be on
both.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 9</p><p><br></p><p>YOU SAID TODAY ‘ASK A BUDDHA WHY HE IS HAPPY AND HE WILL SHRUG HIS
SHOULDERS.’ PLEASE, OSHO, WHY ARE YOU HAPPY?</p><p><br></p><p>I will not even shrug my shoulders.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

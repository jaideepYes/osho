PICKING A STALK HE POINTED TO THE SKULL AND, TURNING TO HIS DISCIPLE PAI FENG, SAID ‘ONLY HE AND I KNOW THAT YOU WERE NEVER BORN AND WILL NEVER DIE. IS IT HE WHO IS TRULY MISERABLE, IS IT WE WHO ARE TRULY HAPPY?’\nI REJOICE in Lieh Tzu – he is one of the most perfect expressions for the inexpressible.\nTruth cannot be expressed: that inexpressibility is intrinsic to truth. Thousands and thousands of people have tried to express it – very few have succeeded even in giving a reflection of it. Lieh Tzu is one of those very few; he is rare.\nBefore we start entering into his world, a few things have to be under stood about him... his approach. His approach is that of an artist: the poet, the story-teller – and he is a master story- teller. Whenever somebody has experienced life, his experience has flowered into parables: that seems to be the easiest way to hint at that which cannot be said. A parable is a device, a great device; it is not just an ordinary story. The purpose of it is not to entertain you, the purpose of it is to say something which there is no other way to say. Life cannot be put into a theory – it is so vast, it is so infinite.\nA theory by its very nature is closed. A theory has to be closed if it is a theory it cannot be open- ended, otherwise it will be meaningless. A parable is open-ended: it says and yet it leaves much to be said, it only hints. And that which cannot be said can be shown. It is a finger pointing to the moon. Don’t cling to the finger – that is irrelevant – look at the moon. These parables in themselves\n2\nare beautiful, but that is not their purpose... they go beyond, they are transcendental. If you dissect the parable itself you will not come to much understanding.\nIt is like the navel in the body of man. If you go to the surgeon and ask him what the purpose of the navel is in the body, and if he dissects the body, he will not find any purpose the navel seems almost useless. What is the purpose of the navel? It WAS purposeful when the child was in the womb: its purpose was that it related the child to the mother, it connected the child with the mother. But now the child is no longer in the womb – the mother may have died, the child has become old now what is the purpose of the navel? It has a transcendental purpose; the purpose is not in itself. You will have to look everywhere, all around, to find the indication – where it indicates. It indicates that the man was once a child, that the child was once in the womb of a mother, that the child was connected with the mother. This is just a mark that the past has left.\nAs the navel shows something about the past, a parable shows something about the future. It shows that there is a possibility of growing, of being connected with existence. Right now that is only a possibility, it is not actual. If you just dissect the parable it becomes an ordinary story. If you don’t dissect it but just drink the meaning of it, the poetry of it, the music of it – forget the story and just carry the significance of it – soon you will see that it indicates towards a future, towards something which can be but is not yet. It is transcendental.\nIn the West, except for Jesus’ parables, nothing like Lieh Tzu, Chuang Tzu, Buddha... nothing like these people’s parables exist only Jesus. And even Jesus’ parables seem to be such that he must have carried them from the East. There are Aesop’s parables, but they are also reflections of the greatest book of parables of the East, PANCHATANTRA. The parable is an Eastern invention, and of tremendous import.\nSo the first thing to be understood about Lieh Tzu: he is not a theoretician, he will not give you any theory; he will simply give you parables.\nA theory can be dissected – its meaning is in it, it has no transcendence, the meaning is immanent. A parable cannot be dissected; dissect, and it will die. The meaning is transcendental it is not in it, it is somewhere else – it HAS to be. You have to live a parable, then you will come to its meaning. It has to become your heart, your breathing; it has to become your inner rhythm. So these parables are tremendously artistic but not mere art: great religion is contained in them.\nLieh Tzu is not a theologian either; he does not talk about God. He TALKS GOD, but he does not talk about God. Whatsoever he says comes from the source, but he does not TALK ABOUT the source let it be very clear to you. There are two types of people: one who talks about God, he is the theologian; one who talks God, he is the mystic. Lieh Tzu is a mystic. The man who talks about God has not known God. otherwise why should he ‘talk about’? The ‘about’ shows his ignorance. When a man talks God he has experienced. Then God is not a theory to be proved, disproved no; then God is his very life: to be lived.\nTo understand a man like Lieh Tzu you will have to live an authentic life. Only then, through your own experience, will you be able to feel what he means by his parables. It is not that you can learn the theories and become informed; the information will not help. Unless you know, nothing is going to help. So if these parables create a thirst in you to know, a great desire to know, a great hunger\nto know; if these parables lead you on an unknown journey, on a pilgrimage – then only, only by treading the path, will you become acquainted with the path.\nLieh Tzu, Chuang Tzu, Lao Tzu, the three Taoist Masters, only talk about the Way ‘Tao’ means the Way – they don’t talk about the goal at all. They say: The goal will take care of itself; you need not worry about the goal. If you know the Way you know the goal, because the goal is not at the very end of the Way, the goal is all over the Way – each moment and each step it is there. It is not that when the Way ends you arrive at the goal; each moment, wherever you are, you are at the goal if you are on the Way. To be on the Way is to be at the goal. Hence they don’t talk about the goal, they don’t talk about God, they don’t talk about MOKSHA, NIRVANA, enlightenment – no, not at all. Very simple is their message: You have to find the Way.\nThings become a little more complicated because they say: The Way has no map, the Way is not charted, the Way is not such that you can follow somebody and find it. The Way is not like a super- highway; the Way is more like a bird flying in the sky – it leaves no marks behind. The bird has flown but no marks are left; nobody can follow. So the Way is a pathless path. It IS a path, but it is a pathless path. It is not ready-made, available; you cannot just decide to walk on it, you will have to find it. And you will have to find it in your own way; nobody else’s way is going to function. Buddha has walked, Lao Tzu has walked, Jesus has walked, but those ways are not going to help you because you are not Jesus, and you are not Lao Tzu, and you are not Lieh Tzu. You are you, a unique individual. Only by walking, only by living your life, will you find the Way. This is something of great value.\nThat’s why Taoism is not an organised religion cannot be. It is an organic religion but not an organised religion. You can be a Taoist if you simply live your life authentically, spontaneously; if you have the courage to go into the unknown on your own, individual, not leaning on anybody, not following anybody, simply going into the dark night not knowing whether you will arrive anywhere or you will be lost. If you have the courage, that risk is there – it is risky, it is adventurous.\nChristianity, Hinduism, Mohammedanism are super-highways: you need not risk anything, you simply follow the crowd, you go with the mob. With Tao you have to go alone, you have to be alone. Tao respects the individual and not the society. Tao respects the unique and not the crowd. Tao respects freedom and not conformity. Tao has no tradition. Tao is a rebellion, and the greatest rebellion possible.\nThat’s why I call Tao ‘the pathless path’. It IS a path, but not like other paths. It has a very different quality to it the quality of freedom, the quality of anarchy, the quality of chaos. Tao says that if you impose a discipline on yourself, you will be a slave. The discipline has to arise out of your awareness, then you will be a Master. If you impose an order on your life this will be just a pretension: the disorder will remain deep in the very core of your being; the order will be on the surface, at the centre there will be disorder. This is not going to help. The real order arises not from the outside, but from the innermost core of your being. Allow disorder don’t repress it. Face it, take the challenge of disorder – and by taking the challenge of disorder and living it, living dangerously, an order arises in your being. That order is out of chaos, not out of any pattern. This is a totally different gestalt: it is born into you and it is fresh; it is not traditional, it is virgin; it is not second-hand. Tao does not believe in the second-hand religion and in the second-hand God. If you take the God of Jesus you become a Christian, if you take the God of Krishna you become a Hindu, if you take the God of\nMohammed you become a Mohammedan. Tao says: But until you find YOUR God you are not on the Way.\nSo all these ways simply distract you from the real Way. Following others, you are going astray. Following any pattern of life, you are becoming a slave. Following any pattern, you are imprisoning yourself. And God, or Tao, or DHARMA, or truth. is possible only to one who is absolutely free, unconditionally free.\nOf course, freedom is dangerous because there is no security in it, no safety in it. There is great safety when you are following the crowd: the crowd protects you. There is great safety when you are following the crowd; because of the very presence of so many people you feel that you are not alone – you cannot be lost. Because of this security you are lost, because of this security you never search and you never seek and you never enquire. And truth cannot be found unless you have enquired unless you have enquired on your own. If you take borrowed truths, you become knowledgeable; but to be knowledgeable is not to know.\nTao is very much against knowledge. Tao says that even if you are ignorant and the ignorance is yours, it is good at least it is yours. and it has an innocence to it. But if you are burdened with accumulated knowledge, scripture, tradition, then you are living a false, pseudo life. Then you are not really living, you are just pretending that you are living. You are making impotent gestures, empty gestures. Your life has not the intensity, the passio – cannot have the passion. That passion arises only when you move on your own, alone, into the vast sky of existence.\nWhy can’t you move alone? Because you don’t trust life. You move with Mohammedans, you move with Hindus, you move with Jews, because you don’t trust life you trust crowds. To move alone one needs great trust in life... the trees, the rivers, the sky, the eternity of it all – one trusts this. You trust man-made conceptions, you trust man-made systems, you trust man-made ideologies. How can man-made ideologies be true?\nMan has created these ideologies just to hide the fact that he does not know, to hide the fact that he is ignorant. Man is cunning, clever, and he can create rationalisations; but these rationalisations are bogus – you cannot move with them into truth. You will have to drop them. Tao says that ignorance is not the barrier against truth – knowledge is the barrier.\nLet me tell you a few anecdotes.\nIn Samuel Beckett’s great work, WAITING FOR GODOT, happens this small incident. Ponder over it.\nTwo tramps, Vladimir and Estragon, are on stage. They are there to wait – just as everybody else in the world is waiting – nobody knows exactly for what. Everybody is waiting, hoping that something is going to happen: today it has not happened, tomorrow it is going to happen. This is the human mind: today is being wasted, but it hopes that tomorrow something is going to happen. And those two tramps are sitting under a tree and waiting... waiting for Godot.\nNobody knows exactly who this Godot is. The word sounds like God, but it only sounds, and in fact the gods you are waiting for are all Godots. You have created them because one has to wait for\nsomething, otherwise how will you tolerate existence? For what? How will you postpone living? How will you hope? Life will become intolerable, impossible, if there is nothing to wait for. Somebody is waiting for money, and somebody is waiting for power, and somebody is waiting for enlightenment, and somebody for something else; but everybody is waiting. And people who wait are the people who miss.\nThese two tramps are there just to wait. What they are waiting for is the coming of a man, Godot, who is expected to provide them with shelter and sustenance. Meanwhile, they try to make time pass with small talk, jokes, games, and minor quarrels.…\nThat’s what your life is: one is engaged meanwhile with small things. The great thing is going to happen tomorrow. Godot will come tomorrow. Today one is quarrelling – the wife with the husband, the husband with the wife. Small things, ‘small talk, jokes, games... tedium and emptiness’. Today, that’s what everybody is feeling: tedium, emptiness‘Nothing to be done’ is the refrain that\nrings again and again.… They say again and again ‘Nothing to be done’, but then they console themselves, ‘but tomorrow he is coming.’ And in fact he has never promised them, they have never met him – it is an invention. One has to invent; out of misery one has to invent the tomorrow and something to cling to. Your gods, your heavens, your paradises, your MOKSHAS, are all inventions. Tao does not talk about them.\nThis play of Samuel Beckett, WAITING FOR GODOT, IS very essentially Taoist.\n... In the midst of the first act, two strangers – Pozzo and Luckystorm onto the stage. Pozzo seems to be a man of affluence; Lucky, the servant, is being driven to a nearby market to be sold. Pozzo tells the tramps about Lucky’s virtues the most remarkable of which is that he can THINK. To show them, Pozzo snaps his whip and commands ‘Think!’ and there follows a long, hysterically incoherent monologue in which fragments of theology, science, sports, and assorted learning jostle in confusion until the three others hurl themselves on him and silence him.\nWhat is your thinking? What are you saying when you say ‘I am thinking’? It is a ‘hysterically incoherent monologue in which fragments of theology, science, sports, and assorted learning jostle in confusion’... until death comes and silences you. What is your whole thinking? What can you think? What is there to think? And through thinking how can one arrive at truth? Thinking cannot deliver truth. Truth is an experience, and the experience happens only when thinking is no longer there.\nSo Tao says that theology is not going to help, philosophy is not going to help, logic is not going to help, reason is not going to help. You can go on thinking and thinking, and it will be nothing but invention – the pure invention of human mind to hide its own stupidity. And then you can go on and on, one dream can lead into another and that other dream can lead you into anotherdream within\ndream within dream that’s what all philosophy, theology is. I have heard a Taoist parable:\nA man of the State of Cheng was one day gathering fuel when he came across a startled deer which he pursued and killed. Fearing lest anyone should see him, he hastily concealed the carcass in a ditch and covered it with plantain leaves, rejoicing excessively at his good fortune. By and by, he\nforgot the place where he had put it; and, thinking he must have been dreaming, he set off towards home, humming over the affair on his way.\nMeanwhile, a man who had overheard his words, acted upon them and went and got the deer. The latter, when he reached his house, told his wife, saying ‘A woodman dreamt he had got a deer, but he did not know where it was. Now I have got the deer, so his dream was a reality.’\n‘It is you’ replied his wife ‘who have been dreaming you saw a woodman. Did he get the deer? And is there really such a person? It is you who have got the deer. How, then, can his dream be a reality?’\n‘It is true’ assented the husband ‘that I have got the deer. It is therefore of little importance whether the woodman dreamt the deer or I dreamt the woodman.’\nNow when the woodman reached his home, he became much annoyed at the loss of the deer and in the night he actually dreamt where the deer then was and who had got it. So next morning he proceeded to the place indicated in his dream – and there it was. He then took legal steps to recover possession. and when the case came on, the magistrate delivered the following judgment: ‘The plaintiff began with a real deer and an alleged dream. He now comes forward with a real dream and an alleged deer. The defendant really got the deer which the plaintiff said he dreamt, and is now trying to keep it; while, according to his wife, both the woodman and the deer are but the figments of a dream, so that no one got the deer at all. However, here is the deer, which you had better divide between you. Nothing else can be done.’\nWhen the Prince of Cheng heard this story, he cried out ‘The magistrate himself must have dreamt the case!’\nDream within dream within dream... this is how the mind goes on. Once you start dreaming, there is no end to it; and what you call thinking is better called dreaming – it is not thinking.\nRemember, truth needs no thinking, it needs experience. When you see the sun and the light you don’t think about it, you SEE it. When you come across a rose flower you don’t THINK about it, you SEE it. When the fragrance comes to your nostrils you smell it, you don’t think about it. I am here, you are looking at me, there is no need to think about me. Whenever you are close to reality, thinking is not needed – then reality is enough, then the experience is enough. When you are far away from reality, you think: you substitute thinking for reality. A man who has eaten well is not going to dream in the night that he has been invited to a feast. A man who has fasted in the day is bound to dream in the night that he has been invited to a feast. A man who is sexually satisfied is not going to dream about sexual objects. That’s the whole of Freudian psychology: you dream about things which are missing in your life, you dream to compensate. That’s the whole Taoist approach too. What Freud says about thinking, about dreaming, the Taoist approach says about thinking as such. And dreaming is only a part of thinking and nothing else.\nThinking is dreaming with words, dreaming is thinking with pictures – that’s the only difference. Dreaming is a primitive way of thinking and thinking is a more evolved way of dreaming – more civilised, more cultured, more intellectual, but it is the same – only the pictures have been replaced by words. And, in a way, because pictures have been replaced by words, it has gone even further away from reality, because reality is closer to pictures than to words.\nLieh Tzu is not thinker. Let that sink deep in you that will help you to understand his parables. Lieh Tzu is a poet, not a thinker; and when I say ‘poet’, I mean one who believes in experiencing, not in speculations.\nThe poet is in search. His search is for the beautiful, but beauty is nothing but truth glimpsed. Truth, when you just glimpse it for a moment, appears as beauty. When truth is realised totally, then you come to know that beauty was only a function of truth. Wherever truth exists, there exists beauty – it is a shadow of truth. When truth is seen through screens, it is beauty; when beauty is naked, it is truth.\nSo the difference between the poet and the mystic is not much. The poet is coming closer, the mystic has arrived. For the poet, there are only glimpses of truth; for the mystic, truth has become his very life. The poet is only sometimes transported to the world of truth and then falls back again. For the mystic, truth has become his abode: he lives there; he lives AS truth.\nPoets come closest to religion. Thinkers, philosophers, logicians, theologians, scientists, are very far away. Their whole approach is verbal. The poetic approach is more existential, and the mystic’s approach is existential par excellence; it is absolutely existential.\nTao means to exist on the Way, and to exist in such a way that the Way and you are not two. This existence is one – we are not separate from it. The separation, the idea of separation, is very illusory. We are joined together, we are one whole. We are not islands, we are one continent. You are in me, I am in you. The trees are in you, you are in the trees. It is an interconnected whole.\nBasho has said: It is as if it were a vast spider’s web. Have you tried? Touch the spider’s web anywhere and the whole web starts shaking, trembling; the whole vibrates. Touch a leaf on the tree and you have made all the stars vibrate with it. You may not be able to see it right now, but things are so deeply related that it is impossible not to touch the stars by touching a leaf, the mall leaf of a tree.\nThe whole is one – separation is not possible. The very idea of separation is the barrier. The idea of separation is what we call the ego. If you are with the ego, you are not on the path, you are not in Tao. When the ego is dropped, you are in Tao. Tao means an egoless existence, living as part of this infinite whole, not living as a separate entity.\nNow, ordinarily we have been taught to live as separate entities, we have been taught to have our own will. People come to me and they ask me ‘How should we develop our will-power?’ Tao is against will, Tao is against will-power, because Tao is for the whole and not for the part. When the part exists in the whole, everything is harmonious. When the part starts existing on its own, everything becomes disharmonious – there is discord, conflict, confusion. When you are not fused with the whole, there is confusion. If the fusion is not happening with the whole, there is bound to be confusion. Whenever you are not with the whole you are unhappy.\nLet this be the definition of happiness: To be with the whole is to be happy. To be with the whole is to be healthy. To be with the whole is to be holy. To be separate is to be unhealthy. To be separate is to be neurotic. To be separate is to fall from grace.\nThe fall of man is not because he has disobeyed God. The fall is because he thinks HE IS. The fall is because man thinks that he is a separate entity. This is foolish: you could not have existed if your parents were not there, and your parents’ parents, and their parents’ parents back... go to Adam and Eve. If Adam and Eve had not existed you would not be here. So you are connected with the whole past.\nAnd Adam and Eve are just a myth. The past has no beginning – cannot have any beginning; the very idea of beginning is absurd. How can things suddenly begin? It is a beginning-less procession of events. You are connected with the whole past; and you are connected with the whole future too, because without you the future will not be the same. You may be nobody, but you will leave your mark. The whole future, the whole eternal future, will have a certain quality because you existed. Maybe you existed only for seventy years, and in those seventy years maybe you existed consciously only for seven seconds, but still you will leave a mark: the whole will not be the same. If you had not been there things would have been completely different; things will now be totally different because you have existed. You will continue. You may not do anything special, anything big and great – just an ordinary life – but still you will affect the whole destiny of existence.\nPast, future – you are connected: this is the dimension of time. And then in space you are connected with everything. These trees, the sun, the moon, the stars... you are connected with everything. If the sun goes out of existence or simply becomes cool, as one day it is bound to become because energy is being dissipated every dayA few scientists think that within four thousand years it will\ncool down – or forty thousand years, or four million years – that doesn’t matter, some day the sun will cool down. The moment the sun cools down, we will all cool down immediately. We will lose life because life needs warmth; so the sun is continuously giving you life. And remember, in life there is no process which is one-way – cannot be. There is give and take: all roads go both ways. If the sun is giving life to you, you must be giving life to the sun in some way or other.\nThat is the meaning when Gurdjieff used to say to his disciples that the moon feeds on man. There is a possibility: you feed on animals, you feed on trees – everything is food for something – so why should man be an exception? Gurdjieff has some point there. Everything is food for something else, so why should man be the only exception that is not food for anything? He is the eater of the whole existence – and he is not food for anything? That is not possible; things are linked. So he invented a beautiful theory that man is food for the moon; the moon feeds on man, man’s consciousness.\nAnd it has some truth in it, because the full-moon night drives people crazy. That’s why mad people are called lunatics LUNA means the moon – moonstruck; a lunatic is moonstruck. The ocean goes WILD. There is a possibility that man also goes wild on the full-moon night, because ninety per cent of man is ocean and nothing else. Ninety per cent of you is just ocean; you are made of ocean. Ninety per cent is water, and this water has the same salts as the ocean in exactly the same proportion. So when the ocean goes wild, something must be happening in your body too\nNinety per cent is ocean within you – something must be going wild. Poets say that they write beautiful poetry on the full-moon night; lovers say that something becomes tremendously romantic. And this is a well established fact now that more people go mad on the full-moon night than on any other night. The least number goes mad on the no-moon night, and the greatest number goes mad on the full-moon night.\nMaybe Gurdjieff has some point in it when he says that the moon feeds on your consciousness. It\nmay be just fiction, but even fictions have some part of truth in them. And when a man like Gurdjieff creates a fiction, it HAS to have some truth in it.\nThe whole is connected. We are eating, we are being eaten: from one side we take, to the other side we give. You eat the apple; one day, the apple tree will eat from your body, your body will become manure. When you are eating the apple, you may never have thought that your father or or your grandfather may be in the apple and that you may be eating your grandmother or grandfather. And, some day, your children will eat you.\nEverything is connected. This connectedness is what is meant by the word ‘Tao’: the connectedness, the interconnectedness, the interdependence of all. Nobody is separate, hence ego is absurd., Only the whole can say ‘I’; the parts should not say ‘I’. If they have to say, they should say it only as a linguistic formality, but they should not claim the ‘I’.\nWhen you exist separately from existence you exist in misery, because you become disconnected; and nobody else is responsible for it – it is you. When you are happy, watch what happens. Whenever you are happy, you don ’t have the ego. In those moments of happiness, joy, bliss, suddenly the ego disappears – you are more melting into the whole; boundaries are less clear, boundaries are more blurred. When the boundaries are totally blurred as if the river has disappeared into the ocean when all boundaries are blurred and you are one, throbbing with the whole, there is happiness.\nIt is said somewhere, sometime, there lived a king. The king had everything that could be desired: wealth, power, even health. He had a wife and children whom he loved, but he did not have happiness. Sad and wearied he sat upon his throne.…\nIt is natural. The more you have of THIS world, the less you have of happiness, because the more you have of this world, the stronger becomes your ego, the more strengthened is your ego, more crystallised – hence unhappiness. So it is never heard of that kings have been happy. very rarely. It is not just a coincidence that Buddha and Mahavir left their kingdoms and became beggars, and by becoming beggars they declared ‘Now we have become emperors’ – because they became happy.\nA sannyasin is a person who has learned the Way of Tao, and he says ‘I am no more. Only the whole is.’ This is the meaning of Jesus when he goes on saying: Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of God. ‘Poor in spirit’ means a man who has no ego, so poor that he has not even the idea of ‘1’. But, from the other side, he is the richest person. That’s why Jesus says: Those who are last here will be the first in my Kingdom of God. The poorest will become the richest. Remember, that by ‘poor’ no financial concept is meant, by ‘poor’ is meant a person who is nothing. By becoming nothing you become part of the whole.\nThe king must have been very unhappy. ‘I must have happiness’ said the king. The royal physician was summoned. ‘I want happiness. Make me happy and I shall make you wealthy. If you do not make me happy, I shall cut off your head’ said the king.\nThe physician was at a loss. What to do? How to make somebody happy? Nobody knows the way, nobody has ever been able to make somebody happy. But the king was mad and he might kill. The physician said ’I will have to meditate, Sire, and consult the scriptures. Tomorrow morning I will\ncome.’ And he meditated the whole night and in the morning he came upon the conclusion: ‘It is very simple.’\nHe had consulted the books, but happiness was not mentioned in the medical books. The problem was difficult, but then he invented – he prescribed a remedy. He said ‘Your Majesty, you must find the shirt of a happy man and take it from him. Then you will have happiness and you will know what happiness is.’ A simple remedy: find the shirt of a happy man and wear it.\nThe king was very happy listening to this, he said ‘So simple?’ He told his chief minister ‘Go and find a happy man and bring his shirt as immediately as possible.’\nThe minister went. He went to the richest man and asked for his shirt, but he said ‘You can take as many shirts as you like, but I am not a happy man. Shirts you can have, as many as you want, but I am unhappy myself, and I too will send my servants to look for a happy man and his shirt. Thank you for your remedy.’\nAnd he visited so many people, but nobody was happy. They were all ready, they said ‘We can give our lives if the king can become happy. What of shirts? We can give our whole lives, but we are not happy – our shirts won’t do.’\nThen the minister was very miserable. What to do? Now he would be at fault – the physician had played a game, so he was very much worried. Then somebody said ‘Don’t be so worried, I know a happy man. And you must have heard him somewhere, sometimes – he plays on his flute in the night, just by the side of the river. You must have heard.’\nHe said ‘Yes, sometimes in the middle of the night, I was enchanted – such beautiful notes. Who is this man? Where is he?’\nThe man said ‘In the night we will go and find him. He always comes, every night.’\nSo they went in the night and the man was playing on his flute and it was tremendously beautiful. And the notes were so blissful that the minister was happy. He said ‘Now I have found the man!’\nWhen they reached there, the man stopped playing. He said ‘What do you want?’ The minister said ‘Are you happy?’\nHe said ‘I am happy, I am happiness. What do you want?’\nThe minister danced with happiness. He said ‘Now. you just give your shirt!’ – and the man remained silent. And the minister said ‘Why are you silent? Give your shirt! The king needs it.’\nThe man said ‘That’s impossible, because I don’t have any shirt. You can’t see because it is dark, but I am sitting naked. I would have given my shirt – I can give my life, but I don’t have any shirt.’\n‘Then why are you happy?’ the minister asked ‘then how are you happy?’\nAnd the man said ‘The day I lost all – shirt and all – I became happy... the day I lost all. In fact I don’t have anything, and I don’t have even myself. I am not playing this flute, the whole is playing through me. I am a nonentity, a nothingness, a nobody’\nThis is the meaning of ‘the poor in spirit’: one who possesses nothing, who has nothing, who knows nothing, who is nothing. Tao says: When you are nothing you will become all. Dissolve and you will become whole. Claim that you are and you will be miserable.\nThis Tao, this merging with the whole, this disappearing into the cosmos, cannot be taught. You can learn it, but it cannot be taught. So Lieh Tzu and other Taoist Masters don’t preach anything; they don’t have anything to preach. They talk in parables. You can listen to the story, and if you really listen, something.something will burst open in you. So the whole thing depends on how you listen.\nLieh Tzu himself was with his Master for many years, just sitting silently, not doing anything, just learning to be silent, learning to be passive, learning to he receptive, learning to be feminine – that is how one becomes a disciple. Let me tell you: there are no Masters, there are only disciples – because it cannot be taught, so how to say that there are Masters? Buddha cannot teach you, Lieh Tzu cannot teach you, so why call them Masters? But if there is a disciple, he learns.\nSo a Master is not one who teaches you, a Master is one in whose presence you can learn. Let the difference be known: a Master is not one who teaches you – because there is nothing to teach. a Master is one in whose presence it is possible to learn.\nA seeker came to Jalaluddin Rumi, the Sufi mystic, and said Will you teach me? Will you teach me, Master?’\nJalaluddin looked at him and said ‘Will you allow me to teach?’\nThe man said ‘Why should I not allow you to teach? I have come to learn.’\nJalaluddin said ‘Because that is the main thing – will you allow me to teach? Otherwise I cannot teach, because in fact teaching is not possible, only learning is possible. If you allow, then the learning will flower.’\nLieh Tzu was with his Master for many years, just sitting silently, not doing anything, just becoming more and more passive. A day arrived when he was absolutely silent: there was not a ripple of thought in his being, not a wave. His energy was totally there, a reservoir, a placid lake with no waves, no wind blowing – and he understood.\nIn a single moment it happens. Truth is not a process, it is a happening. It is not gradual, it needs no time to happen. If time is needed, the time is needed only for you because you cannot be silent right now. If you can be silent. it can happen right now. It happens always in silence.\nWhat happens in silence? When you are silent, you are not the boundaries dissolve, you are one with the total.\nThen what is the function of a Master? The function of the Master is JUST to be close to you, so that you can have a taste of someone who has tasted the whole, so he can become a VIA MEDIA.\nIt is difficult for you to taste the whole because you are so full of the ego. Somebody who is egoless, in whom God is flowing easily, one who is glowing with God, streaming with his energy... just by the side of him, sitting silently, waiting, some day you are overflooded.\nLet me tell you one Taoist story.\nA disciple of Lao Tzu said ‘Master, I have arrived.’\nLao Tzu said ‘If you say you have arrived. then it is certain that you have not arrived.’\nThe disciple waited for a few months, then one day he said ‘You were right, Master. Now, it HAS ARRIVED.’\nFirst he had said ‘I have arrived’. and the Master denied. And then after a few months, one day. suddenly he burst open, and he said ‘It has arrived.’\nLao Tzu looked with tremendous compassion and love and patted his head. And he said Now it is right. Now, tell me what has happened. Now I would like to listen. What has happened?’\nHe said ‘Up to that day when you said ’If you say you have arrived. then it is certain that you have not arrived” I was making effort. I was doing all that I could do, I was trying hard. The day you said “If you say you have arrived, then you have not arrived” it struck home. How could ’I’ arrive? because ‘I’ is the barrier. so I had to give way.’\nIt can arrive. and Taoists even call it ‘It’. They don’t call it ‘he’. they don’t call it ‘she’, they don’t call It ‘God the Father’, they don’t call it by any personal name they simply say ‘it’. ‘It’ is non-personal, it is the name of the whole: ‘Tao’ means it.\n‘Tao has arrived’ he said ‘and it came only when I was not there.’\nLao Tzu said ‘Tell the other disciples the situation in which it happened.’ And he said ’The only thing that I can say is that I was not good, I was not bad, I was not a sinner, I was not a saint, I was not this, I was not that, I was not anybody in particular when it arrived. I was just a passivity, a tremendous passivity, just a door, an opening. I had not even invited it. Listen! I had not even invited it, because even the invitation would have gone with my signature. I had not even invited.In fact,\nI had completely forgotten about it. I was just sitting. I was not even seeking, searching, enquiring. I was not there. and suddenly it overflooded me.’\nIt happens that way. It can happen to you here if you just become more and more passive. Tao is the way of the feminine. All other religions are aggressive, all other religions are more male- oriented; Tao is more female. And remember, truth comes only when you are in a feminine state of consciousness – never otherwise. You cannot conquer truth. That is foolish, silly even to think about, that you can conquer truth. The part conquering the whole! The part can only allow, the part can only be in a let-go.\nThis let-go will happen if you can do one thing: stop clinging to knowledge, stop clinging to philosophies. stop clinging to doctrines, dogmas. Stop clinging to the churches and the organized\nreligion, otherwise you will have false conceptions. and those false conceptions won’t allow the truth to enter you.\nA beautiful parable:\nAll along the farmyard gables the swallows sat a-row, twittering uneasily to one another, telling of many things. but thinking only of summer and the south, for autumn was afoot and the north wind waiting.\nAnd suddenly, one day they were all quite gone. And everyone spoke of the swallows and the south. ‘I think I shall go south myself next year’ said a hen.\nAnd the year wore on and the swallows came; the year wore on and they sat again on the gables, and all the poultry discussed the departure of the hen.\nAnd very early one morning, the wind being from the north, the swallows all soared suddenly and felt the wind in their wings; and a strength came upon them, and a strange old knowledge and a more than human faith; and flying high, they left the smoke of our cities.\n‘I think the wind is about right’ said the hen, and she spread her wings and ran out of the poultry yard. And she ran fluttering out onto the road and some way down it, until she came to a garden.\nAt evening she came back panting. And in the poultry yard she told the poultry how she had gone south as far as the highroad, and had seen the great world’s traffic going by. And she had come to lands where the potato grew and had seen the stubble upon which men live. And at the end of the road she had found a garden, and there were roses in it beautiful roses and the gardener himself was there.\n‘How extremely interesting’ the poultry said ‘and what a really beautiful description!’\nAnd the winter wore away, and the bitter months went by. and the spring of the year appeared, and the swallows came again.\nBut the poultry would not agree that there was a sea in the south, ‘You should hear our hen!’ they said.\nNow the hen has become the knower. She knows what is in the south, and she has not even gone outside the town – just down the road a little bit.\nIntellect is a hen.It cannot go very far. But once The hen knows something, it prevents; it becomes\nan obstacle.\nDrop your intellect, and you will not lose anything. Carry your intellect with yourself and you will lose all. Drop your intellect, and you will lose only your imprisonment, your falsity. Drop your intellect. and suddenly your consciousness will soar high, will be on its wingsand you can go to the very\nsouth, to the open seas where you belong. Intellect is the burden on man.\nThe last thing before we go into this parable: Tao starts with death. Why? There is something significant in the beginning. Tao says that if you understand death you will understand everything, because in death your boundaries will be blurred. In death, you will disappear. In death, ego will be dropped. In death, mind will be no longer there. In death, all that is non-essential will be dropped and only the essential will remain.\nIf you can understand death you will be able to understand what Tao is, what the pathless path is – because religion is also a way of dying, love is also a way of dying, prayer is also a way of dying. Meditation is voluntary death. Death is the greatest phenomenon. It is the culmination of life, the crescendo, the highest peak. You know only one peak, and that peak is of sex, and that is the lowest peak of the Himalayas. Yes, it is a peak, but the lowest peak; death is the highest peak.\nSex is birth: it is the beginning of the Himalayas, the lowest peak. Just at the beginning the highest is not possible. Slowly, slowly, the peaks rise higher and higher, finally they come to the peak. Death is the peak, sex is the beginning. Between sex and death is the whole story of life.\nWestern psychology starts by understanding sex. Eastern psychology, the psychology of the Buddhas, starts by understanding the psychology of death. To understand sex is very primary; to understand death is the ultimate.\nAnd by understanding death you can die consciously. If you die consciously you will hot be born again – there will be no need. You have learned the lesson, you will not be thrown back again and again into the wheel of life and death. You have known, you have learned – there is no need for you to be sent again to the school; you have transcended. If you don’t learn the meaning of death you will have to be thrown back. Life is a situation to learn what death is.\nThis parable:\nWHEN LIEH TZU WAS EATING AL THE ROADSIDE ON A JOURNEY JO WEI, HE SAW A HUNDRED-YEAR-OLD SKULL. PICKING A STALK HE POINTED TO THE SKULL AND, TURNING TO HIS DISCIPLE PAI FENG, SAID ‘ONLY HE AND I KNOW THAT YOU WERE NEVER BORN AND WILL NEVER DIE. IS IT HE WHO IS TRULY MISERABLE, IS IT WE WHO ARE TRULY HAPPY?’\nA very cryptic statement: a code which has to be decoded. ‘ONLY HE AND I KNOW’ said Lieh Tzu, pointing to the hundred-year-old skull, ‘THAT YOU WERE NEVER BORN AND WILL NEVER DIE.’ Why does he say ’ONLY HE AND r? The skull has died a non-voluntary death, and Lieh Tzu has died a voluntary death – both are dead in a way.\nLieh Tzu has died through meditation. Lieh Tzu has died because he is no longer an ego, because he is no longer separate from the whole, because he IS no more. This is real death, deeper in fact than the death of the skull. It is not really certain whether the man who has died, and whose skull has lain there for a hundred years, has known. It is not certain – he may not have known, he may have known. But it is certain that Lieh Tzu knows: his death is conscious.\nBut he used the situation. A parable uses a situation. His disciple, Pai Feng, was sitting by his side, the skull was Lying there, and he pointed to the skull.\n‘ONLY HE AND I KNOW THAT YOU WERE NEVER BORN AND WILL NEVER DIE.’\nWho dies? And who is born? The ego is born and the ego dies. Deep down, where ego is no more, you are never born and you never die. You are eternal, you are eternity, you are the very substratum, the very stuff that existence is made of – how can you die? But ego is born and ego dies.\nYou are never born and you can never die, but how to know it? Would you like to wait until death comes? That is very risky, because if you live your whole life unconsciously, there is not much possibility that you may become conscious when you die. It is not possible if your whole life has been a continuity of unconscious living, you will die unconsciously, you will not be able to know. You will die in a coma, you will not be able to observe and see what is happening. You were not even able to see life, how can you see death? Death is more subtle.\nIf you really want to know. then start becoming alert, aware. Live consciously, learn consciousness, accumulate consciousness. Become a great flame of consciousness, then, when death comes. you will be able to witness it, you will be able to see it and you will know ‘The body is dying, the ego is dying, but I am not dying because I am the witness.’ That witness is the very core of existence. That witness is what other religions call ‘God’. and what Lieh Tzu. Chuang Tzu call ‘Tao’: the knower, the knowing element, consciousness, awareness, alertness.\nStart living a conscious life. Do whatsoever you are doing, but do as if you are a witness to it – watch it, silently go on observing it. Don’t get lost into things; remain alert, remain beyond. Start from small things: walking on the road, eating, taking a bath, holding the hand of a friend, talking, listening – small things. but keep alert. You will forget again and again. Pick it up again, find it out again. remember it again. This is what Buddha calls ‘mindfulness’. what Gurdjieff calls ‘self-remembering’.\nGo on remembering that you are a witness. In the beginning it is arduous, hard, because our sleep is long. We have slept for many lives. we have become accustomed to sleep. we are snoring – metaphysically. It is difficult. but if you try. by and by a ray of alertness will enter in your being. It is possible – difficult, but possible – not impossible. And this is the most valuable thing in life.\n‘ONLY HE AND I KNOW THAT yOU WERE NEVER BORN AND WILL NEVER DIE.’\nI know you will never die, because you were never born, but you don’t know it. My knowing is not going to help you – you have to know it. It has to become your own understanding: ’a light unto yourself.\n‘IS IT HE WHO IS TRULY MISERABLE, IS IT WE WHO ARE TRULY HAPPY?’\nAnd then he puts a question to his disciple ‘Who is happy those who are alive or those who are dead? Who is really miserable – those who are dead or those who are alive? And who is really happy?’ And he leaves the question. It is a koan: the disciple has to meditate on it.\nThe parable says nothing. it ends abruptly. Now the disciple has to work it out. Now he has to meditate, he has to be aware of death. of life. of love, of this and that. And he has to meditate on the fact: Who is really happy? Are you happy by being just alive? You are not; the whole world is so miserable. So one thing can be deduced, and can be deduced unconditionally, that just by being alive one is not bound to be happy. Just being alive is not enough to be happy – something more is needed to be happy, something ‘plus’. Life plus awareness... then happiness arises, because in awareness, in the light of awareness, the darkness of ego disappears.\nNow, when life has a plus point of awareness great things happen. First: the ego disappears. and with the ego disappears death, because only ego can die – because ego was born. With ego, birth has disappeared, death has disappeared. With ego, your separation from existence has disappeared.\nThis is the meaning of the crucifixion: ego is crucified. When Jesus is crucified, Christ is born – that is the meaning of resurrection. On one side crucifixion, on the other side resurrection.\nDie if you really want to be alive – very paradoxical. but tremendously true, absolutely true. As you are, you are neither dead nor alive. You are hanging in-between, hence the misery. the tension, the anguish. You are split: you are neither alive nor dead. Either be totally alive, and then you will know what life is; or be totally dead, then too you will know what life is – because with totality opens the door of Tao.\nBe total. A man who is asleep cannot be total in anything. You are eating, you are not total there; you are thinking a thousand and one things, you are dreaming a thousand and one dreams, you are just stuffing mechanically. You may be making love to your woman or to your man you are not totally there. You may be thinking of other women: making love to your wife and thinking of some other woman. Or you may be thinking of the market, or of the prices of things that you want to purchase, or of a car, or of a house, or of a thousand and one things – and you are making love mechanically.\nBe total in your acts, and if you are total you have to be aware; nobody can be total without being aware. Being total means no other thinking. If you are eating, you are simply eating; you are totally here-now. The eating is all: you are not only stuffing, you are enjoying it. Body, mind, soul all are in tune while you are eating: there is a harmony, a deep rhythm, between all three layers of your being. Then eating becomes meditation, walking becomes meditation, chopping wood becomes meditation, carrying water from the well becomes meditation, cooking food becomes meditation. Small things are transformed: they become luminous acts, and each act becomes so total that each act has the quality of Tao.\nThen you are not the doer when you are total. Then God is the doer, or the total is the doer – you are just a vehicle, a passage. And becoming that passage is bliss, is benediction.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9433","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/tao_the_pathless_path_vol_1/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/tao_the_pathless_path_vol_1/>Tao.

A HUNDRED-YEAR-OLD SKULL. PICKING A STALK HE POINTED TO THE SKULL AND,
TURNING TO HIS DISCIPLE PAI FENG, SAID ‘ONLY HE AND I KNOW THAT YOU WERE
NEVER BORN AND WILL NEVER DIE. IS IT HE WHO IS TRULY MISERABLE, IS IT WE
WHO ARE TRULY HAPPY?’</p><p><br></p><p>I REJOICE in Lieh Tzu – he is one of the most perfect expressions for
the inexpressible.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth cannot be expressed: that inexpressibility is intrinsic to
truth. Thousands and thousands of people have tried to express it – very
few have succeeded even in giving a reflection of it. Lieh Tzu is one of
those very few; he is rare.</p><p><br></p><p>Before we start entering into his world, a few things have to be
under stood about him... his approach. His approach is that of an
artist: the poet, the story-teller – and he is a master story- teller.
Whenever somebody has experienced life, his experience has flowered into
parables: that seems to be the easiest way to hint at that which cannot
be said. A parable is a device, a great device; it is not just an
ordinary story. The purpose of it is not to entertain you, the purpose
of it is to say something which there is no other way to say. Life
cannot be put into a theory – it is so vast, it is so infinite.</p><p><br></p><p>A theory by its very nature is closed. A theory has to be closed if
it is a theory it cannot be open- ended, otherwise it will be
meaningless. A parable is open-ended: it says and yet it leaves much to
be said, it only hints. And that which cannot be said can be shown. It
is a finger pointing to the moon. Don’t cling to the finger – that is
irrelevant – look at the moon. These parables in themselves</p><p><br></p><p>2</p><p>are beautiful, but that is not their purpose... they go beyond, they
are transcendental. If you dissect the parable itself you will not come
to much understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>It is like the navel in the body of man. If you go to the surgeon and
ask him what the purpose of the navel is in the body, and if he dissects
the body, he will not find any purpose the navel seems almost useless.
What is the purpose of the navel? It WAS purposeful when the child was
in the womb: its purpose was that it related the child to the mother, it
connected the child with the mother. But now the child is no longer in
the womb – the mother may have died, the child has become old now what
is the purpose of the navel? It has a transcendental purpose; the
purpose is not in itself. You will have to look everywhere, all around,
to find the indication – where it indicates. It indicates that the man
was once a child, that the child was once in the womb of a mother, that
the child was connected with the mother. This is just a mark that the
past has left.</p><p><br></p><p>As the navel shows something about the past, a parable shows
something about the future. It shows that there is a possibility of
growing, of being connected with existence. Right now that is only a
possibility, it is not actual. If you just dissect the parable it
becomes an ordinary story. If you don’t dissect it but just drink the
meaning of it, the poetry of it, the music of it – forget the story and
just carry the significance of it – soon you will see that it indicates
towards a future, towards something which can be but is not yet. It is
transcendental.</p><p><br></p><p>In the West, except for Jesus’ parables, nothing like Lieh Tzu,
Chuang Tzu, Buddha... nothing like these people’s parables exist only
Jesus. And even Jesus’ parables seem to be such that he must have
carried them from the East. There are Aesop’s parables, but they are
also reflections of the greatest book of parables of the East,
PANCHATANTRA. The parable is an Eastern invention, and of tremendous
import.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing to be understood about Lieh Tzu: he is not a
theoretician, he will not give you any theory; he will simply give you
parables.</p><p><br></p><p>A theory can be dissected – its meaning is in it, it has no
transcendence, the meaning is immanent. A parable cannot be dissected;
dissect, and it will die. The meaning is transcendental it is not in it,
it is somewhere else – it HAS to be. You have to live a parable, then
you will come to its meaning. It has to become your heart, your
breathing; it has to become your inner rhythm. So these parables are
tremendously artistic but not mere art: great religion is contained in
them.</p><p><br></p><p>Lieh Tzu is not a theologian either; he does not talk about God. He
TALKS GOD, but he does not talk about God. Whatsoever he says comes from
the source, but he does not TALK ABOUT the source let it be very clear
to you. There are two types of people: one who talks about God, he is
the theologian; one who talks God, he is the mystic. Lieh Tzu is a
mystic. The man who talks about God has not known God. otherwise why
should he ‘talk about’? The ‘about’ shows his ignorance. When a man
talks God he has experienced. Then God is not a theory to be proved,
disproved no; then God is his very life: to be lived.</p><p><br></p><p>To understand a man like Lieh Tzu you will have to live an authentic
life. Only then, through your own experience, will you be able to feel
what he means by his parables. It is not that you can learn the theories
and become informed; the information will not help. Unless you know,
nothing is going to help. So if these parables create a thirst in you to
know, a great desire to know, a great hunger</p><p>to know; if these parables lead you on an unknown journey, on a
pilgrimage – then only, only by treading the path, will you become
acquainted with the path.</p><p><br></p><p>Lieh Tzu, Chuang Tzu, Lao Tzu, the three Taoist Masters, only talk
about the Way ‘Tao’ means the Way – they don’t talk about the goal at
all. They say: The goal will take care of itself; you need not worry
about the goal. If you know the Way you know the goal, because the goal
is not at the very end of the Way, the goal is all over the Way – each
moment and each step it is there. It is not that when the Way ends you
arrive at the goal; each moment, wherever you are, you are at the goal
if you are on the Way. To be on the Way is to be at the goal. Hence they
don’t talk about the goal, they don’t talk about God, they don’t talk
about MOKSHA, NIRVANA, enlightenment – no, not at all. Very simple is
their message: You have to find the Way.</p><p><br></p><p>Things become a little more complicated because they say: The Way has
no map, the Way is not charted, the Way is not such that you can follow
somebody and find it. The Way is not like a super- highway; the Way is
more like a bird flying in the sky – it leaves no marks behind. The bird
has flown but no marks are left; nobody can follow. So the Way is a
pathless path. It IS a path, but it is a pathless path. It is not
ready-made, available; you cannot just decide to walk on it, you will
have to find it. And you will have to find it in your own way; nobody
else’s way is going to function. Buddha has walked, Lao Tzu has walked,
Jesus has walked, but those ways are not going to help you because you
are not Jesus, and you are not Lao Tzu, and you are not Lieh Tzu. You
are you, a unique individual. Only by walking, only by living your life,
will you find the Way. This is something of great value.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why Taoism is not an organised religion cannot be. It is an
organic religion but not an organised religion. You can be a Taoist if
you simply live your life authentically, spontaneously; if you have the
courage to go into the unknown on your own, individual, not leaning on
anybody, not following anybody, simply going into the dark night not
knowing whether you will arrive anywhere or you will be lost. If you
have the courage, that risk is there – it is risky, it is
adventurous.</p><p><br></p><p>Christianity, Hinduism, Mohammedanism are super-highways: you need
not risk anything, you simply follow the crowd, you go with the mob.
With Tao you have to go alone, you have to be alone. Tao respects the
individual and not the society. Tao respects the unique and not the
crowd. Tao respects freedom and not conformity. Tao has no tradition.
Tao is a rebellion, and the greatest rebellion possible.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I call Tao ‘the pathless path’. It IS a path, but not like
other paths. It has a very different quality to it the quality of
freedom, the quality of anarchy, the quality of chaos. Tao says that if
you impose a discipline on yourself, you will be a slave. The discipline
has to arise out of your awareness, then you will be a Master. If you
impose an order on your life this will be just a pretension: the
disorder will remain deep in the very core of your being; the order will
be on the surface, at the centre there will be disorder. This is not
going to help. The real order arises not from the outside, but from the
innermost core of your being. Allow disorder don’t repress it. Face it,
take the challenge of disorder – and by taking the challenge of disorder
and living it, living dangerously, an order arises in your being. That
order is out of chaos, not out of any pattern. This is a totally
different gestalt: it is born into you and it is fresh; it is not
traditional, it is virgin; it is not second-hand. Tao does not believe
in the second-hand religion and in the second-hand God. If you take the
God of Jesus you become a Christian, if you take the God of Krishna you
become a Hindu, if you take the God of</p><p>Mohammed you become a Mohammedan. Tao says: But until you find YOUR
God you are not on the Way.</p><p><br></p><p>So all these ways simply distract you from the real Way. Following
others, you are going astray. Following any pattern of life, you are
becoming a slave. Following any pattern, you are imprisoning yourself.
And God, or Tao, or DHARMA, or truth. is possible only to one who is
absolutely free, unconditionally free.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, freedom is dangerous because there is no security in it,
no safety in it. There is great safety when you are following the crowd:
the crowd protects you. There is great safety when you are following the
crowd; because of the very presence of so many people you feel that you
are not alone – you cannot be lost. Because of this security you are
lost, because of this security you never search and you never seek and
you never enquire. And truth cannot be found unless you have enquired
unless you have enquired on your own. If you take borrowed truths, you
become knowledgeable; but to be knowledgeable is not to know.</p><p><br></p><p>Tao is very much against knowledge. Tao says that even if you are
ignorant and the ignorance is yours, it is good at least it is yours.
and it has an innocence to it. But if you are burdened with accumulated
knowledge, scripture, tradition, then you are living a false, pseudo
life. Then you are not really living, you are just pretending that you
are living. You are making impotent gestures, empty gestures. Your life
has not the intensity, the passio – cannot have the passion. That
passion arises only when you move on your own, alone, into the vast sky
of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Why can’t you move alone? Because you don’t trust life. You move with
Mohammedans, you move with Hindus, you move with Jews, because you don’t
trust life you trust crowds. To move alone one needs great trust in
life... the trees, the rivers, the sky, the eternity of it all – one
trusts this. You trust man-made conceptions, you trust man-made systems,
you trust man-made ideologies. How can man-made ideologies be true?</p><p><br></p><p>Man has created these ideologies just to hide the fact that he does
not know, to hide the fact that he is ignorant. Man is cunning, clever,
and he can create rationalisations; but these rationalisations are bogus
– you cannot move with them into truth. You will have to drop them. Tao
says that ignorance is not the barrier against truth – knowledge is the
barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me tell you a few anecdotes.</p><p><br></p><p>In Samuel Beckett’s great work, WAITING FOR GODOT, happens this small
incident. Ponder over it.</p><p><br></p><p>Two tramps, Vladimir and Estragon, are on stage. They are there to
wait – just as everybody else in the world is waiting – nobody knows
exactly for what. Everybody is waiting, hoping that something is going
to happen: today it has not happened, tomorrow it is going to happen.
This is the human mind: today is being wasted, but it hopes that
tomorrow something is going to happen. And those two tramps are sitting
under a tree and waiting... waiting for Godot.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody knows exactly who this Godot is. The word sounds like God, but
it only sounds, and in fact the gods you are waiting for are all Godots.
You have created them because one has to wait for</p><p>something, otherwise how will you tolerate existence? For what? How
will you postpone living? How will you hope? Life will become
intolerable, impossible, if there is nothing to wait for. Somebody is
waiting for money, and somebody is waiting for power, and somebody is
waiting for enlightenment, and somebody for something else; but
everybody is waiting. And people who wait are the people who miss.</p><p><br></p><p>These two tramps are there just to wait. What they are waiting for is
the coming of a man, Godot, who is expected to provide them with shelter
and sustenance. Meanwhile, they try to make time pass with small talk,
jokes, games, and minor quarrels.…</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what your life is: one is engaged meanwhile with small things.
The great thing is going to happen tomorrow. Godot will come tomorrow.
Today one is quarrelling – the wife with the husband, the husband with
the wife. Small things, ‘small talk, jokes, games... tedium and
emptiness’. Today, that’s what everybody is feeling: tedium,
emptiness<span class=s4></span>‘Nothing to be done’ is the refrain
that</p><p>rings again and again.… They say again and again ‘Nothing to be
done’, but then they console themselves, ‘but tomorrow he is coming.’
And in fact he has never promised them, they have never met him – it is
an invention. One has to invent; out of misery one has to invent the
tomorrow and something to cling to. Your gods, your heavens, your
paradises, your MOKSHAS, are all inventions. Tao does not talk about
them.</p><p><br></p><p>This play of Samuel Beckett, WAITING FOR GODOT, IS very essentially
Taoist.</p><p><br></p><p>... In the midst of the first act, two strangers – Pozzo and
Luckystorm onto the stage. Pozzo seems to be a man of affluence; Lucky,
the servant, is being driven to a nearby market to be sold. Pozzo tells
the tramps about Lucky’s virtues the most remarkable of which is that he
can THINK. To show them, Pozzo snaps his whip and commands ‘Think!’ and
there follows a long, hysterically incoherent monologue in which
fragments of theology, science, sports, and assorted learning jostle in
confusion until the three others hurl themselves on him and silence
him.</p><p><br></p><p>What is your thinking? What are you saying when you say ‘I am
thinking’? It is a ‘hysterically incoherent monologue in which fragments
of theology, science, sports, and assorted learning jostle in
confusion’... until death comes and silences you. What is your whole
thinking? What can you think? What is there to think? And through
thinking how can one arrive at truth? Thinking cannot deliver truth.
Truth is an experience, and the experience happens only when thinking is
no longer there.</p><p><br></p><p>So Tao says that theology is not going to help, philosophy is not
going to help, logic is not going to help, reason is not going to help.
You can go on thinking and thinking, and it will be nothing but
invention – the pure invention of human mind to hide its own stupidity.
And then you can go on and on, one dream can lead into another and that
other dream can lead you into another<span class=s4></span>dream
within</p><p>dream within dream that’s what all philosophy, theology is. I have
heard a Taoist parable:</p><p>A man of the State of Cheng was one day gathering fuel when he came
across a startled deer which he pursued and killed. Fearing lest anyone
should see him, he hastily concealed the carcass in a ditch and covered
it with plantain leaves, rejoicing excessively at his good fortune. By
and by, he</p><p>forgot the place where he had put it; and, thinking he must have been
dreaming, he set off towards home, humming over the affair on his
way.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile, a man who had overheard his words, acted upon them and
went and got the deer. The latter, when he reached his house, told his
wife, saying ‘A woodman dreamt he had got a deer, but he did not know
where it was. Now I have got the deer, so his dream was a reality.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘It is you’ replied his wife ‘who have been dreaming you saw a
woodman. Did he get the deer? And is there really such a person? It is
you who have got the deer. How, then, can his dream be a reality?’</p><p><br></p><p>‘It is true’ assented the husband ‘that I have got the deer. It is
therefore of little importance whether the woodman dreamt the deer or I
dreamt the woodman.’</p><p><br></p><p>Now when the woodman reached his home, he became much annoyed at the
loss of the deer and in the night he actually dreamt where the deer then
was and who had got it. So next morning he proceeded to the place
indicated in his dream – and there it was. He then took legal steps to
recover possession. and when the case came on, the magistrate delivered
the following judgment: ‘The plaintiff began with a real deer and an
alleged dream. He now comes forward with a real dream and an alleged
deer. The defendant really got the deer which the plaintiff said he
dreamt, and is now trying to keep it; while, according to his wife, both
the woodman and the deer are but the figments of a dream, so that no one
got the deer at all. However, here is the deer, which you had better
divide between you. Nothing else can be done.’</p><p><br></p><p>When the Prince of Cheng heard this story, he cried out ‘The
magistrate himself must have dreamt the case!’</p><p><br></p><p>Dream within dream within dream... this is how the mind goes on. Once
you start dreaming, there is no end to it; and what you call thinking is
better called dreaming – it is not thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, truth needs no thinking, it needs experience. When you see
the sun and the light you don’t think about it, you SEE it. When you
come across a rose flower you don’t THINK about it, you SEE it. When the
fragrance comes to your nostrils you smell it, you don’t think about it.
I am here, you are looking at me, there is no need to think about me.
Whenever you are close to reality, thinking is not needed – then reality
is enough, then the experience is enough. When you are far away from
reality, you think: you substitute thinking for reality. A man who has
eaten well is not going to dream in the night that he has been invited
to a feast. A man who has fasted in the day is bound to dream in the
night that he has been invited to a feast. A man who is sexually
satisfied is not going to dream about sexual objects. That’s the whole
of Freudian psychology: you dream about things which are missing in your
life, you dream to compensate. That’s the whole Taoist approach too.
What Freud says about thinking, about dreaming, the Taoist approach says
about thinking as such. And dreaming is only a part of thinking and
nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>Thinking is dreaming with words, dreaming is thinking with pictures –
that’s the only difference. Dreaming is a primitive way of thinking and
thinking is a more evolved way of dreaming – more civilised, more
cultured, more intellectual, but it is the same – only the pictures have
been replaced by words. And, in a way, because pictures have been
replaced by words, it has gone even further away from reality, because
reality is closer to pictures than to words.</p><p>Lieh Tzu is not thinker. Let that sink deep in you that will help you
to understand his parables. Lieh Tzu is a poet, not a thinker; and when
I say ‘poet’, I mean one who believes in experiencing, not in
speculations.</p><p><br></p><p>The poet is in search. His search is for the beautiful, but beauty is
nothing but truth glimpsed. Truth, when you just glimpse it for a
moment, appears as beauty. When truth is realised totally, then you come
to know that beauty was only a function of truth. Wherever truth exists,
there exists beauty – it is a shadow of truth. When truth is seen
through screens, it is beauty; when beauty is naked, it is truth.</p><p><br></p><p>So the difference between the poet and the mystic is not much. The
poet is coming closer, the mystic has arrived. For the poet, there are
only glimpses of truth; for the mystic, truth has become his very life.
The poet is only sometimes transported to the world of truth and then
falls back again. For the mystic, truth has become his abode: he lives
there; he lives AS truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Poets come closest to religion. Thinkers, philosophers, logicians,
theologians, scientists, are very far away. Their whole approach is
verbal. The poetic approach is more existential, and the mystic’s
approach is existential par excellence; it is absolutely
existential.</p><p><br></p><p>Tao means to exist on the Way, and to exist in such a way that the
Way and you are not two. This existence is one – we are not separate
from it. The separation, the idea of separation, is very illusory. We
are joined together, we are one whole. We are not islands, we are one
continent. You are in me, I am in you. The trees are in you, you are in
the trees. It is an interconnected whole.</p><p><br></p><p>Basho has said: It is as if it were a vast spider’s web. Have you
tried? Touch the spider’s web anywhere and the whole web starts shaking,
trembling; the whole vibrates. Touch a leaf on the tree and you have
made all the stars vibrate with it. You may not be able to see it right
now, but things are so deeply related that it is impossible not to touch
the stars by touching a leaf, the mall leaf of a tree.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole is one – separation is not possible. The very idea of
separation is the barrier. The idea of separation is what we call the
ego. If you are with the ego, you are not on the path, you are not in
Tao. When the ego is dropped, you are in Tao. Tao means an egoless
existence, living as part of this infinite whole, not living as a
separate entity.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, ordinarily we have been taught to live as separate entities, we
have been taught to have our own will. People come to me and they ask me
‘How should we develop our will-power?’ Tao is against will, Tao is
against will-power, because Tao is for the whole and not for the part.
When the part exists in the whole, everything is harmonious. When the
part starts existing on its own, everything becomes disharmonious –
there is discord, conflict, confusion. When you are not fused with the
whole, there is confusion. If the fusion is not happening with the
whole, there is bound to be confusion. Whenever you are not with the
whole you are unhappy.</p><p><br></p><p>Let this be the definition of happiness: To be with the whole is to
be happy. To be with the whole is to be healthy. To be with the whole is
to be holy. To be separate is to be unhealthy. To be separate is to be
neurotic. To be separate is to fall from grace.</p><p>The fall of man is not because he has disobeyed God. The fall is
because he thinks HE IS. The fall is because man thinks that he is a
separate entity. This is foolish: you could not have existed if your
parents were not there, and your parents’ parents, and their parents’
parents back... go to Adam and Eve. If Adam and Eve had not existed you
would not be here. So you are connected with the whole past.</p><p><br></p><p>And Adam and Eve are just a myth. The past has no beginning – cannot
have any beginning; the very idea of beginning is absurd. How can things
suddenly begin? It is a beginning-less procession of events. You are
connected with the whole past; and you are connected with the whole
future too, because without you the future will not be the same. You may
be nobody, but you will leave your mark. The whole future, the whole
eternal future, will have a certain quality because you existed. Maybe
you existed only for seventy years, and in those seventy years maybe you
existed consciously only for seven seconds, but still you will leave a
mark: the whole will not be the same. If you had not been there things
would have been completely different; things will now be totally
different because you have existed. You will continue. You may not do
anything special, anything big and great – just an ordinary life – but
still you will affect the whole destiny of existence.</p><p>Past, future – you are connected: this is the dimension of time. And
then in space you are connected with everything. These trees, the sun,
the moon, the stars... you are connected with everything. If the sun
goes out of existence or simply becomes cool, as one day it is bound to
become because energy is being dissipated every day<span class=s4></span>A few scientists think that within four thousand years
it will</p><p>cool down – or forty thousand years, or four million years – that
doesn’t matter, some day the sun will cool down. The moment the sun
cools down, we will all cool down immediately. We will lose life because
life needs warmth; so the sun is continuously giving you life. And
remember, in life there is no process which is one-way – cannot be.
There is give and take: all roads go both ways. If the sun is giving
life to you, you must be giving life to the sun in some way or
other.</p><p>That is the meaning when Gurdjieff used to say to his disciples that
the moon feeds on man. There is a possibility: you feed on animals, you
feed on trees – everything is food for something – so why should man be
an exception? Gurdjieff has some point there. Everything is food for
something else, so why should man be the only exception that is not food
for anything? He is the eater of the whole existence – and he is not
food for anything? That is not possible; things are linked. So he
invented a beautiful theory that man is food for the moon; the moon
feeds on man, man’s consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>And it has some truth in it, because the full-moon night drives
people crazy. That’s why mad people are called lunatics LUNA means the
moon – moonstruck; a lunatic is moonstruck. The ocean goes WILD. There
is a possibility that man also goes wild on the full-moon night, because
ninety per cent of man is ocean and nothing else. Ninety per cent of you
is just ocean; you are made of ocean. Ninety per cent is water, and this
water has the same salts as the ocean in exactly the same proportion. So
when the ocean goes wild, something must be happening in your body
too</p><p><br></p><p>Ninety per cent is ocean within you – something must be going wild.
Poets say that they write beautiful poetry on the full-moon night;
lovers say that something becomes tremendously romantic. And this is a
well established fact now that more people go mad on the full-moon night
than on any other night. The least number goes mad on the no-moon night,
and the greatest number goes mad on the full-moon night.</p><p><br></p><p>Maybe Gurdjieff has some point in it when he says that the moon feeds
on your consciousness. It</p><p>may be just fiction, but even fictions have some part of truth in
them. And when a man like Gurdjieff creates a fiction, it HAS to have
some truth in it.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole is connected. We are eating, we are being eaten: from one
side we take, to the other side we give. You eat the apple; one day, the
apple tree will eat from your body, your body will become manure. When
you are eating the apple, you may never have thought that your father or
or your grandfather may be in the apple and that you may be eating your
grandmother or grandfather. And, some day, your children will eat
you.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything is connected. This connectedness is what is meant by the
word ‘Tao’: the connectedness, the interconnectedness, the
interdependence of all. Nobody is separate, hence ego is absurd., Only
the whole can say ‘I’; the parts should not say ‘I’. If they have to
say, they should say it only as a linguistic formality, but they should
not claim the ‘I’.</p><p><br></p><p>When you exist separately from existence you exist in misery, because
you become disconnected; and nobody else is responsible for it – it is
you. When you are happy, watch what happens. Whenever you are happy, you
don ’t have the ego. In those moments of happiness, joy, bliss, suddenly
the ego disappears – you are more melting into the whole; boundaries are
less clear, boundaries are more blurred. When the boundaries are totally
blurred as if the river has disappeared into the ocean when all
boundaries are blurred and you are one, throbbing with the whole, there
is happiness.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said somewhere, sometime, there lived a king. The king had
everything that could be desired: wealth, power, even health. He had a
wife and children whom he loved, but he did not have happiness. Sad and
wearied he sat upon his throne.…</p><p><br></p><p>It is natural. The more you have of THIS world, the less you have of
happiness, because the more you have of this world, the stronger becomes
your ego, the more strengthened is your ego, more crystallised – hence
unhappiness. So it is never heard of that kings have been happy. very
rarely. It is not just a coincidence that Buddha and Mahavir left their
kingdoms and became beggars, and by becoming beggars they declared ‘Now
we have become emperors’ – because they became happy.</p><p><br></p><p>A sannyasin is a person who has learned the Way of Tao, and he says
‘I am no more. Only the whole is.’ This is the meaning of Jesus when he
goes on saying: Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the
Kingdom of God. ‘Poor in spirit’ means a man who has no ego, so poor
that he has not even the idea of ‘1’. But, from the other side, he is
the richest person. That’s why Jesus says: Those who are last here will
be the first in my Kingdom of God. The poorest will become the richest.
Remember, that by ‘poor’ no financial concept is meant, by ‘poor’ is
meant a person who is nothing. By becoming nothing you become part of
the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>The king must have been very unhappy. ‘I must have happiness’ said
the king. The royal physician was summoned. ‘I want happiness. Make me
happy and I shall make you wealthy. If you do not make me happy, I shall
cut off your head’ said the king.</p><p><br></p><p>The physician was at a loss. What to do? How to make somebody happy?
Nobody knows the way, nobody has ever been able to make somebody happy.
But the king was mad and he might kill. The physician said ’I will have
to meditate, Sire, and consult the scriptures. Tomorrow morning I
will</p><p>come.’ And he meditated the whole night and in the morning he came
upon the conclusion: ‘It is very simple.’</p><p><br></p><p>He had consulted the books, but happiness was not mentioned in the
medical books. The problem was difficult, but then he invented – he
prescribed a remedy. He said ‘Your Majesty, you must find the shirt of a
happy man and take it from him. Then you will have happiness and you
will know what happiness is.’ A simple remedy: find the shirt of a happy
man and wear it.</p><p><br></p><p>The king was very happy listening to this, he said ‘So simple?’ He
told his chief minister ‘Go and find a happy man and bring his shirt as
immediately as possible.’</p><p><br></p><p>The minister went. He went to the richest man and asked for his
shirt, but he said ‘You can take as many shirts as you like, but I am
not a happy man. Shirts you can have, as many as you want, but I am
unhappy myself, and I too will send my servants to look for a happy man
and his shirt. Thank you for your remedy.’</p><p><br></p><p>And he visited so many people, but nobody was happy. They were all
ready, they said ‘We can give our lives if the king can become happy.
What of shirts? We can give our whole lives, but we are not happy – our
shirts won’t do.’</p><p><br></p><p>Then the minister was very miserable. What to do? Now he would be at
fault – the physician had played a game, so he was very much worried.
Then somebody said ‘Don’t be so worried, I know a happy man. And you
must have heard him somewhere, sometimes – he plays on his flute in the
night, just by the side of the river. You must have heard.’</p><p><br></p><p>He said ‘Yes, sometimes in the middle of the night, I was enchanted –
such beautiful notes. Who is this man? Where is he?’</p><p><br></p><p>The man said ‘In the night we will go and find him. He always comes,
every night.’</p><p><br></p><p>So they went in the night and the man was playing on his flute and it
was tremendously beautiful. And the notes were so blissful that the
minister was happy. He said ‘Now I have found the man!’</p><p><br></p><p>When they reached there, the man stopped playing. He said ‘What do
you want?’ The minister said ‘Are you happy?’</p><p>He said ‘I am happy, I am happiness. What do you want?’</p><p><br></p><p>The minister danced with happiness. He said ‘Now. you just give your
shirt!’ – and the man remained silent. And the minister said ‘Why are
you silent? Give your shirt! The king needs it.’</p><p><br></p><p>The man said ‘That’s impossible, because I don’t have any shirt. You
can’t see because it is dark, but I am sitting naked. I would have given
my shirt – I can give my life, but I don’t have any shirt.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Then why are you happy?’ the minister asked ‘then how are you
happy?’</p><p>And the man said ‘The day I lost all – shirt and all – I became
happy... the day I lost all. In fact I don’t have anything, and I don’t
have even myself. I am not playing this flute, the whole is playing
through me. I am a nonentity, a nothingness, a nobody<span class=s4></span>’</p><p><br></p><p>This is the meaning of ‘the poor in spirit’: one who possesses
nothing, who has nothing, who knows nothing, who is nothing. Tao says:
When you are nothing you will become all. Dissolve and you will become
whole. Claim that you are and you will be miserable.</p><p><br></p><p>This Tao, this merging with the whole, this disappearing into the
cosmos, cannot be taught. You can learn it, but it cannot be taught. So
Lieh Tzu and other Taoist Masters don’t preach anything; they don’t have
anything to preach. They talk in parables. You can listen to the story,
and if you really listen, something.<span class=s4></span>something
will burst open in you. So the whole thing depends on how you
listen.</p><p><br></p><p>Lieh Tzu himself was with his Master for many years, just sitting
silently, not doing anything, just learning to be silent, learning to be
passive, learning to he receptive, learning to be feminine – that is how
one becomes a disciple. Let me tell you: there are no Masters, there are
only disciples – because it cannot be taught, so how to say that there
are Masters? Buddha cannot teach you, Lieh Tzu cannot teach you, so why
call them Masters? But if there is a disciple, he learns.</p><p><br></p><p>So a Master is not one who teaches you, a Master is one in whose
presence you can learn. Let the difference be known: a Master is not one
who teaches you – because there is nothing to teach. a Master is one in
whose presence it is possible to learn.</p><p><br></p><p>A seeker came to Jalaluddin Rumi, the Sufi mystic, and said Will you
teach me? Will you teach me, Master?’</p><p><br></p><p>Jalaluddin looked at him and said ‘Will you allow me to teach?’</p><p><br></p><p>The man said ‘Why should I not allow you to teach? I have come to
learn.’</p><p><br></p><p>Jalaluddin said ‘Because that is the main thing – will you allow me
to teach? Otherwise I cannot teach, because in fact teaching is not
possible, only learning is possible. If you allow, then the learning
will flower.’</p><p><br></p><p>Lieh Tzu was with his Master for many years, just sitting silently,
not doing anything, just becoming more and more passive. A day arrived
when he was absolutely silent: there was not a ripple of thought in his
being, not a wave. His energy was totally there, a reservoir, a placid
lake with no waves, no wind blowing – and he understood.</p><p><br></p><p>In a single moment it happens. Truth is not a process, it is a
happening. It is not gradual, it needs no time to happen. If time is
needed, the time is needed only for you because you cannot be silent
right now. If you can be silent. it can happen right now. It happens
always in silence.</p><p><br></p><p>What happens in silence? When you are silent, you are not the
boundaries dissolve, you are one with the total.</p><p><br></p><p>Then what is the function of a Master? The function of the Master is
JUST to be close to you, so that you can have a taste of someone who has
tasted the whole, so he can become a VIA MEDIA.</p><p>It is difficult for you to taste the whole because you are so full of
the ego. Somebody who is egoless, in whom God is flowing easily, one who
is glowing with God, streaming with his energy... just by the side of
him, sitting silently, waiting, some day you are overflooded.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me tell you one Taoist story.</p><p><br></p><p>A disciple of Lao Tzu said ‘Master, I have arrived.’</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu said ‘If you say you have arrived. then it is certain that
you have not arrived.’</p><p><br></p><p>The disciple waited for a few months, then one day he said ‘You were
right, Master. Now, it HAS ARRIVED.’</p><p><br></p><p>First he had said ‘I have arrived’. and the Master denied. And then
after a few months, one day. suddenly he burst open, and he said ‘It has
arrived.’</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu looked with tremendous compassion and love and patted his
head. And he said Now it is right. Now, tell me what has happened. Now I
would like to listen. What has happened?’</p><p><br></p><p>He said ‘Up to that day when you said ’If you say you have arrived.
then it is certain that you have not arrived” I was making effort. I was
doing all that I could do, I was trying hard. The day you said “If you
say you have arrived, then you have not arrived” it struck home. How
could ’I’ arrive? because ‘I’ is the barrier. so I had to give way.’</p><p><br></p><p>It can arrive. and Taoists even call it ‘It’. They don’t call it
‘he’. they don’t call it ‘she’, they don’t call It ‘God the Father’,
they don’t call it by any personal name they simply say ‘it’. ‘It’ is
non-personal, it is the name of the whole: ‘Tao’ means it.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Tao has arrived’ he said ‘and it came only when I was not
there.’</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu said ‘Tell the other disciples the situation in which it
happened.’ And he said ’The only thing that I can say is that I was not
good, I was not bad, I was not a sinner, I was not a saint, I was not
this, I was not that, I was not anybody in particular when it arrived. I
was just a passivity, a tremendous passivity, just a door, an opening. I
had not even invited it. Listen! I had not even invited it, because even
the invitation would have gone with my signature. I had not even
invited.<span class=s4></span>In fact,</p><p>I had completely forgotten about it. I was just sitting. I was not
even seeking, searching, enquiring. I was not there. and suddenly it
overflooded me.’</p><p><br></p><p>It happens that way. It can happen to you here if you just become
more and more passive. Tao is the way of the feminine. All other
religions are aggressive, all other religions are more male- oriented;
Tao is more female. And remember, truth comes only when you are in a
feminine state of consciousness – never otherwise. You cannot conquer
truth. That is foolish, silly even to think about, that you can conquer
truth. The part conquering the whole! The part can only allow, the part
can only be in a let-go.</p><p><br></p><p>This let-go will happen if you can do one thing: stop clinging to
knowledge, stop clinging to philosophies. stop clinging to doctrines,
dogmas. Stop clinging to the churches and the organized</p><p>religion, otherwise you will have false conceptions. and those false
conceptions won’t allow the truth to enter you.</p><p><br></p><p>A beautiful parable:</p><p><br></p><p>All along the farmyard gables the swallows sat a-row, twittering
uneasily to one another, telling of many things. but thinking only of
summer and the south, for autumn was afoot and the north wind
waiting.</p><p><br></p><p>And suddenly, one day they were all quite gone. And everyone spoke of
the swallows and the south. ‘I think I shall go south myself next year’
said a hen.</p><p>And the year wore on and the swallows came; the year wore on and they
sat again on the gables, and all the poultry discussed the departure of
the hen.</p><p><br></p><p>And very early one morning, the wind being from the north, the
swallows all soared suddenly and felt the wind in their wings; and a
strength came upon them, and a strange old knowledge and a more than
human faith; and flying high, they left the smoke of our cities.</p><p><br></p><p>‘I think the wind is about right’ said the hen, and she spread her
wings and ran out of the poultry yard. And she ran fluttering out onto
the road and some way down it, until she came to a garden.</p><p><br></p><p>At evening she came back panting. And in the poultry yard she told
the poultry how she had gone south as far as the highroad, and had seen
the great world’s traffic going by. And she had come to lands where the
potato grew and had seen the stubble upon which men live. And at the end
of the road she had found a garden, and there were roses in it beautiful
roses and the gardener himself was there.</p><p><br></p><p>‘How extremely interesting’ the poultry said ‘and what a really
beautiful description!’</p><p><br></p><p>And the winter wore away, and the bitter months went by. and the
spring of the year appeared, and the swallows came again.</p><p><br></p><p>But the poultry would not agree that there was a sea in the south,
‘You should hear our hen!’ they said.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the hen has become the knower. She knows what is in the south,
and she has not even gone outside the town – just down the road a little
bit.</p><p><br></p><p>Intellect is a hen.<span class=s4></span>It cannot go very far. But
once The hen knows something, it prevents; it becomes</p><p>an obstacle.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop your intellect, and you will not lose anything. Carry your
intellect with yourself and you will lose all. Drop your intellect, and
you will lose only your imprisonment, your falsity. Drop your intellect.
and suddenly your consciousness will soar high, will be on its
wings<span class=s4></span>and you can go to the very</p><p>south, to the open seas where you belong. Intellect is the burden on
man.</p><p>The last thing before we go into this parable: Tao starts with death.
Why? There is something significant in the beginning. Tao says that if
you understand death you will understand everything, because in death
your boundaries will be blurred. In death, you will disappear. In death,
ego will be dropped. In death, mind will be no longer there. In death,
all that is non-essential will be dropped and only the essential will
remain.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can understand death you will be able to understand what Tao
is, what the pathless path is – because religion is also a way of dying,
love is also a way of dying, prayer is also a way of dying. Meditation
is voluntary death. Death is the greatest phenomenon. It is the
culmination of life, the crescendo, the highest peak. You know only one
peak, and that peak is of sex, and that is the lowest peak of the
Himalayas. Yes, it is a peak, but the lowest peak; death is the highest
peak.</p><p><br></p><p>Sex is birth: it is the beginning of the Himalayas, the lowest peak.
Just at the beginning the highest is not possible. Slowly, slowly, the
peaks rise higher and higher, finally they come to the peak. Death is
the peak, sex is the beginning. Between sex and death is the whole story
of life.</p><p><br></p><p>Western psychology starts by understanding sex. Eastern psychology,
the psychology of the Buddhas, starts by understanding the psychology of
death. To understand sex is very primary; to understand death is the
ultimate.</p><p><br></p><p>And by understanding death you can die consciously. If you die
consciously you will hot be born again – there will be no need. You have
learned the lesson, you will not be thrown back again and again into the
wheel of life and death. You have known, you have learned – there is no
need for you to be sent again to the school; you have transcended. If
you don’t learn the meaning of death you will have to be thrown back.
Life is a situation to learn what death is.</p><p><br></p><p>This parable:</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN LIEH TZU WAS EATING AL THE ROADSIDE ON A JOURNEY JO WEI, HE SAW
A HUNDRED-YEAR-OLD SKULL. PICKING A STALK HE POINTED TO THE SKULL AND,
TURNING TO HIS DISCIPLE PAI FENG, SAID ‘ONLY HE AND I KNOW THAT YOU WERE
NEVER BORN AND WILL NEVER DIE. IS IT HE WHO IS TRULY MISERABLE, IS IT WE
WHO ARE TRULY HAPPY?’</p><p><br></p><p>A very cryptic statement: a code which has to be decoded. ‘ONLY HE
AND I KNOW’ said Lieh Tzu, pointing to the hundred-year-old skull, ‘THAT
YOU WERE NEVER BORN AND WILL NEVER DIE.’ Why does he say ’ONLY HE AND r?
The skull has died a non-voluntary death, and Lieh Tzu has died a
voluntary death – both are dead in a way.</p><p><br></p><p>Lieh Tzu has died through meditation. Lieh Tzu has died because he is
no longer an ego, because he is no longer separate from the whole,
because he IS no more. This is real death, deeper in fact than the death
of the skull. It is not really certain whether the man who has died, and
whose skull has lain there for a hundred years, has known. It is not
certain – he may not have known, he may have known. But it is certain
that Lieh Tzu knows: his death is conscious.</p><p><br></p><p>But he used the situation. A parable uses a situation. His disciple,
Pai Feng, was sitting by his side, the skull was Lying there, and he
pointed to the skull.</p><p><br></p><p>‘ONLY HE AND I KNOW THAT YOU WERE NEVER BORN AND WILL NEVER DIE.’</p><p>Who dies? And who is born? The ego is born and the ego dies. Deep
down, where ego is no more, you are never born and you never die. You
are eternal, you are eternity, you are the very substratum, the very
stuff that existence is made of – how can you die? But ego is born and
ego dies.</p><p><br></p><p>You are never born and you can never die, but how to know it? Would
you like to wait until death comes? That is very risky, because if you
live your whole life unconsciously, there is not much possibility that
you may become conscious when you die. It is not possible if your whole
life has been a continuity of unconscious living, you will die
unconsciously, you will not be able to know. You will die in a coma, you
will not be able to observe and see what is happening. You were not even
able to see life, how can you see death? Death is more subtle.</p><p><br></p><p>If you really want to know. then start becoming alert, aware. Live
consciously, learn consciousness, accumulate consciousness. Become a
great flame of consciousness, then, when death comes. you will be able
to witness it, you will be able to see it and you will know ‘The body is
dying, the ego is dying, but I am not dying because I am the witness.’
That witness is the very core of existence. That witness is what other
religions call ‘God’. and what Lieh Tzu. Chuang Tzu call ‘Tao’: the
knower, the knowing element, consciousness, awareness, alertness.</p><p><br></p><p>Start living a conscious life. Do whatsoever you are doing, but do as
if you are a witness to it – watch it, silently go on observing it.
Don’t get lost into things; remain alert, remain beyond. Start from
small things: walking on the road, eating, taking a bath, holding the
hand of a friend, talking, listening – small things. but keep alert. You
will forget again and again. Pick it up again, find it out again.
remember it again. This is what Buddha calls ‘mindfulness’. what
Gurdjieff calls ‘self-remembering’.</p><p><br></p><p>Go on remembering that you are a witness. In the beginning it is
arduous, hard, because our sleep is long. We have slept for many lives.
we have become accustomed to sleep. we are snoring – metaphysically. It
is difficult. but if you try. by and by a ray of alertness will enter in
your being. It is possible – difficult, but possible – not impossible.
And this is the most valuable thing in life.</p><p><br></p><p>‘ONLY HE AND I KNOW THAT yOU WERE NEVER BORN AND WILL NEVER DIE.’</p><p><br></p><p>I know you will never die, because you were never born, but you don’t
know it. My knowing is not going to help you – you have to know it. It
has to become your own understanding: ’a light unto yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>‘IS IT HE WHO IS TRULY MISERABLE, IS IT WE WHO ARE TRULY HAPPY?’</p><p><br></p><p>And then he puts a question to his disciple ‘Who is happy those who
are alive or those who are dead? Who is really miserable – those who are
dead or those who are alive? And who is really happy?’ And he leaves the
question. It is a koan: the disciple has to meditate on it.</p><p><br></p><p>The parable says nothing. it ends abruptly. Now the disciple has to
work it out. Now he has to meditate, he has to be aware of death. of
life. of love, of this and that. And he has to meditate on the fact: Who
is really happy? Are you happy by being just alive? You are not; the
whole world is so miserable. So one thing can be deduced, and can be
deduced unconditionally, that just by being alive one is not bound to be
happy. Just being alive is not enough to be happy – something more is
needed to be happy, something ‘plus’. Life plus awareness... then
happiness arises, because in awareness, in the light of awareness, the
darkness of ego disappears.</p><p>Now, when life has a plus point of awareness great things happen.
First: the ego disappears. and with the ego disappears death, because
only ego can die – because ego was born. With ego, birth has
disappeared, death has disappeared. With ego, your separation from
existence has disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the meaning of the crucifixion: ego is crucified. When Jesus
is crucified, Christ is born – that is the meaning of resurrection. On
one side crucifixion, on the other side resurrection.</p><p><br></p><p>Die if you really want to be alive – very paradoxical. but
tremendously true, absolutely true. As you are, you are neither dead nor
alive. You are hanging in-between, hence the misery. the tension, the
anguish. You are split: you are neither alive nor dead. Either be
totally alive, and then you will know what life is; or be totally dead,
then too you will know what life is – because with totality opens the
door of Tao.</p><p><br></p><p>Be total. A man who is asleep cannot be total in anything. You are
eating, you are not total there; you are thinking a thousand and one
things, you are dreaming a thousand and one dreams, you are just
stuffing mechanically. You may be making love to your woman or to your
man you are not totally there. You may be thinking of other women:
making love to your wife and thinking of some other woman. Or you may be
thinking of the market, or of the prices of things that you want to
purchase, or of a car, or of a house, or of a thousand and one things –
and you are making love mechanically.</p><p><br></p><p>Be total in your acts, and if you are total you have to be aware;
nobody can be total without being aware. Being total means no other
thinking. If you are eating, you are simply eating; you are totally
here-now. The eating is all: you are not only stuffing, you are enjoying
it. Body, mind, soul all are in tune while you are eating: there is a
harmony, a deep rhythm, between all three layers of your being. Then
eating becomes meditation, walking becomes meditation, chopping wood
becomes meditation, carrying water from the well becomes meditation,
cooking food becomes meditation. Small things are transformed: they
become luminous acts, and each act becomes so total that each act has
the quality of Tao.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you are not the doer when you are total. Then God is the doer,
or the total is the doer – you are just a vehicle, a passage. And
becoming that passage is bliss, is benediction.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

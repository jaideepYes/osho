IT\nFEELS SO MUCH LIKE A NO TO ALL THESE OLD THINGS. IS IT JUST AWARENESS AND LOVE THAT IS IT?\nPrem Mariam,\nREVOLUTION IS NO, REBELLION IS YES. Revolution is negative, rebellion\nis positive. Revolution says no to all that is wrong and should not be. Rebellion says yes to all that is beautiful, good. Revolution is past-oriented, rebellion is present-oriented. They are not synonymous.\nRevolution is destructive, rebellion is creative. Revolution can never be feminine, receptive, yes-saying. That is impossible. But rebellion is always feminine, always receptive, always yes-saying.\nI am talking about rebellion, I am not talking about revolution. Revolution is political, rebellion is spiritual. Revolution is of the crowd, rebellion is individual. You can be a rebel and you don't need anybody else to be with you -- you alone can be a rebel. But you alone cannot be a revolutionary; you will need a great organization, you will need a great army behind you.\nAnd the problem is -- one of the most significant things to be understood -- that when you fight with somebody, slowly slowly, you become like your enemy. It's bound to be so; it follows a certain natural course. If you have to fight with somebody, you have to be like him; otherwise you will not be able to fight with him. Choose your enemy very carefully.\nFriends can be chosen without much care -- they don't affect you so much -- but enemies are very decisive.\nAll revolutions fail because of the enemy. The enemy decides the whole thing. The czars of Russia decided the structure of the communist party; the czars decided how Joseph Stalin was going to be. And he proved a bigger czar than any other czar, and he proved even more terrible than Ivan the Terrible.\nFighting with the czar, fighting with the imperialist structure of the czar, they learnt the whole strategy, all the tactics. By the time they came in power, they were perfectly groomed by the czar, by the enemy. By the time they came in power, they started behaving in the same way against their enemies as the czar had been behaving with them.\nThis you can see all over the world again and again. Right now this is happening in Iran.\nThe Emperor is gone, and a far worse regime has taken his place. Khomeini is proving at least ten times more violent than the Emperor himself. Khomeini has learnt the whole strategy from the Emperor; his whole life he has suffered,\nstruggled. That has been his school. Now, with a vengeance, he is proving himself to be a bigger emperor than the Emperor himself Now, every day, hundreds of people are being executed, killed.\nThis has happened always: revolutions fail because they are reactions. Never be a revolutionary: be a rebel. A rebel is not AGAINST the past; the past is not even worth that. To be against it m.ans to be focussed on it; to be against it means you are paying too much attention to it. To be against it means you are hypnotized by it.\nA few are for it -- they are hypnotized. And a few are against it -- they are hypnotized.\nThe rebel is one who simply sees the whole futility of it, and without fighting drops it. If you fight, it will cling to you; if you fight, you have to cling to it. It will become your definition. Don't let the past define you; simply slip out of it, just like a snake slips out of the old skin -- and never even looks back. That is the way of the rebel.\nI teach the way of the rebel. That is the way of religion -- religion is rebellion, not revolution. And it gives immense respect to the individual. Each one can be a rebel in his own way: just simply slip out of the past. There is no need to struggle with it -- it is no MORE there. And if you go on fighting... you don't have that long a life. The past has been very long -- millions of years -- how are you going to fight with it in a life that consists at the most of seventy or eighty years? In this small life span, how are you going to fight with the past which is so huge, immense?\nThe only wise way is to slip out of it; there is no need to fight with it. And this has to be understood on many levels.\nPolitically, people fight with the past -- the Hindu past, the Christian past, the Mohammedan past -- and they become like the past they are fighting with.\nPsychologically, since Sigmund Freud, people are fighting with their own individual pasts -- the childhood traumas. That too is big, and if you have to sort it out and fight with everything and put everything right, your whole present and future will be wasted in it. The past is already wasted, the present will be wasted in psychoanalysis, and the whole future you will be fighting, and fighting with the past. And to fight with the past is to fight with a shadow -- you can never\nwin. How can you win against a shadow? It does not exist in the first place. You have only to see that it is a shadow! and that is that.\nThat is the basic difference between the psychological approach towards life and the religious approach. Religion simply says: \"Be more meditative, be more aware. Be right now here!\" In that very awareness, in that crystal-clear consciousness, you see that the past is an unnecessary burden -- you need not carry it. Nobody can force you to carry it; you are carrying it on your own, it is your decision.\nYour parents are not there to enforce it... it is already gone! Just shadows are lingering.\nSee that they are shadows, and you are free. In that very seeing is freedom. In that very understanding is liberation. And then all your energies are available to be herenow. Then you can bloom! Then you can blossom. Then your life can have some fulfillment, some joy, some celebration.\nRevolution is against the past and for the future -- both are non-existential. The past is no more and the future is not yet. And revolution consists only of past and future: against the past and for some future utopia. The word 'utopia' is very beautiful; literally it means 'that which never comes'.\nRebellion consists of the present and only the present. It has no concern with the past, it has no concern with the future. It loves, lives, dances, sings, but its space is here, and its time is now. And then you can be feminine, and then you can be receptive, and then you can be yea-saying.\nThe second question Question 2\nOSHO, I ONCE READ SOMEWHERE THAT WHEN BUDDHA WAS ASKED BY A DISCIPLE TO DESCRIBE LIFE BRIEFLY, THE BUDDHA REPLIED 'MISERY'. IS\nTHIS TRUE?\nZareen,\nIT IS TRUE. But if a Buddha had asked Buddha, \"What is life? -- describe briefly,\" he would have said, \"Bliss.\" The answer has nothing to do with the question; the answer has something to do with the questioner. The answer depends on the questioner. A man like Gautam Buddha does not answer questions, he answers questioners. He is not saying anything about life, mind you -- he is not saying anything about life. He is saying something about the life of the man who had asked the question.\nBuddha is not saying about his own life that it is a misery; certainly it is not. Nobody has seen such grandeur, such bliss; nobody has walked on this earth with such grace, such utter celebration. Nobody does humanity remember who has been more beautiful. How can Buddha say that life is misery? You should remember: he is not talking about life as such; he is talking about the life of the man who had asked the question.\nAnd then it becomes a problem, because for forty-two years Buddha continued answering people, and different people required different answers, and sometimes contradictory answers. A Buddha has to contradict himself almost every day.\nOnce it happened:\nIn the morning a man asked Buddha, Is there a God?\" and Buddha said, \"No.\" And in the afternoon another person asked, \"Is there a God?\" and Buddha said, \"Yes.\" And by the evening a third person asked, \"Is there a God?\" and Buddha kept quiet, didn't answer, remained silent.\nAnanda, who was Buddha's chief disciple, was present on all three occasions. He was continuously behind Buddha like a shadow -- serving him, taking care of his body, looking after his needs. He was very much puzzled: \"In a single day Buddha has said there is no God, Buddha has said there is a God, and Buddha has kept silent too, he has not answered this way or that. These are the only three possibilities -- all the possibilities exhausted, in a single day? All the answers given.\"\nHe could not sleep; he tossed and turned, and Buddha asked, \"What is the matter with you tonight? Are you not tired or something?\"\nHe said, \"I don't want to disturb you, but unless you answer me this question I don't think I will be able to sleep. In the morning you said no, in the afternoon\nyou said yes, and by the evening you remained silent, you didn't answer -- and the question was exactly the same!\"\nBuddha laughed and he said, \"The person who had come early in the morning and had asked 'Is there a God?' was a theist, was a believer. He wanted me to say yes so that his belief could become more strengthened -- and I don't strengthen people's beliefs, because a believing mind is never a seeing mind. To believe is to remain in darkness. I wanted to shatter his belief. My answer had nothing to do with God; my answer had something to do with that man. He was there just to accumulate a little more evidence for his belief, so he could say to people that 'Not only do I believe that there is a God, but even Buddha says there is a God!'\n\"He had not come to understand. He simply wanted me to be a witness to HIS belief And his belief is just out of fear, a conditioning taught by others. His belief is nothing but a cover-up for his ignorance. I cannot be in any way a help to it. I had to shatter it. I had to shout no, emphatically. And it helped. 'Buddha says no?' Enquiry started in his being.\nNow he cannot be at rest with his belief He will have to come -- you will see.\"\nAnd one day he came again, and he said to Buddha, \"You did it: since that time my worship has become empty. Since that time I go to the temple, but the temple no longer has any deity in it. Since that time I know it is only a belief. If you say God is not, then who am I to say God is? You are so godly, you must be true. I have come to enquire.\nNow I come to you without any belief. Now I come to you open -- to seek, to search.\nNow my question is not rooted in my knowledge.\" And Buddha said to Ananda, \"The second person was an atheist -- he believed that there is no God. He had come in the same way as the first one: to have my support.\" His belief was as stupid as the first one's, because to believe without knowing is to be stupid. Believe only when you have known, but then it is not a belief at all; it is a totally different experience. It is trust. It is not based on somebody else's experience; it is your OWN experience. You are reborn in it. It is not Hindu, Christian, Mohammedan -- it is simply your experience. And even if the whole world says it is not so, you cannot deny it, your trust cannot be shaken.\n\"The other person,\" Buddha said, \"was an atheist, hence I had to say YES, and\nemphatically I had to say yes.\"\nAnanda said, \"And what about the third?\"\nBuddha said, \"He was neither a theist, nor an atheist, so neither was yes needed nor was no needed. He was really an innocent soul, a very pure heart. His question was not out of his a priori knowledge; his question was really innocent. His question was a quest, an enquiry. I had to remain silent -- because that was my answer to him. And he understood it.\n\"Did you not watch: when I remained silent and closed my eyes, he also closed his eyes, and a great silence descended on him. And did you not observe? -- when he went his eyes were shining, his eyes were like lit candles. And did you not observe? -- when he left, he touched my feet, bowed down, thanked me, saying 'You answered rightly,' although I had not answered him at all. That man tasted something of my silence, imbibed something of my being. That man was the true seeker.\"\nA true seeker does not need a verbal answer: a true seeker needs something existential --\na penetration of the heart into the heart, a penetration of the soul into the soul. The real seeker wants the Master to overlap him. The real seeker wants the Master to go into his innermost core and stir the sleeping soul.\nZareen, your question is significant. You say:\nI ONCE READ SOMEWHERE THAT WHEN BUDDHA WAS ASKED BY A\nDISCIPLE TO DESCRIBE LIFE BRIEFLY, THE BUDDHA REPLIED 'MISERY.'\nIt is true. Many times he said to many people that life is misery; and many times he said to many people that life is bliss -- SATCHITANANDA -- it is truth, it is consciousness, it is bliss.\nBut people have gathered more the answer that life is misery, because it fits with their own experience. When the Buddha says, \"Life is joy,\" it doesn't fit with your experience.\nIt falls on flat ears. You hear it, but you cannot understand it. It does not ring any bells in your heart.\nSo the answers that he gave to those who had come to know something of bliss, something of joy, something of song, have not become so important. And it was only rarely that he would say that, because it is only a rare person who will require that answer. Millions and millions need to be told, \"Your life is misery.\" It IS so.\nBut why does Buddha say your life is misery, why? He says it so that you can come out of it. You can have another kind of life -- this is not the only kind! This is only one of the ways, and the worst way possible. You have created a hell out of your life; and if it can be a hell, it can also be a heaven; if it can be misery, it can be bliss. It is the same energy used wrongly that becomes misery, AND used rightly becomes bliss.\nWhat is misery? Misery is feeling separate from existence, feeling isolated from existence, feeling alienated from existence -- that is misery. And what is bliss? Feeling one with existence, orgasmically one with existence, organically one with existence.\nHaving an ego is misery, and becoming egolessness is bliss. Both alternatives are open.\nThe choice is yours.\nZareen, listening to Buddha's answer that life is misery, don't settle there. His answer is to unsettle you. His answer is to shock you. His answer is to wake you up to the fact that your life is misery. But people are really cunning, very cunning; they listen only to that which they want to listen to. People are so cunning that listening to the statement that life is misery, they say, ''Then nothing can be done. If life is misery, then I have to live a miserable life, then this is all there is -- so live it! Live it anyhow.\"\nRather than creating a desire to transform themselves, they completely drown themselves in their misery -- as if Buddha has given them a certificate that this is what life is all about. People are so cunning, they simply listen only to that which they want to listen to.\n\"This is all a mistake, Your Honour,\" said the first harlot. \"I was walking along\nand this guy \"\n\"Just a minute, young lady,\" said the judge. \"Now, you have been here a dozen times --\none hundred dollars fine. Next!\"\n\"I am just a poor private secretary,\" said the second girl, \"and I was not doing anything \"\n\"I recognize you too, miss,\" said the magistrate. \"Two hundred dollars or ten days in jail.\nNext case!\"\n\"Judge,\" said the third girl, \"I am a prostitute. I am not proud of it, but it is the only way I can support my three kids. I am guilty.\"\n\"Young woman,\" said the judge, \"I like your honesty, and because of it I am going to give you a break. Your case is dismissed and, sergeant, give this girl fifty dollars out of the policemen's fund.\"\nNow comes poor old Liebowitz, arrested for selling ties without a license. \"Your Honour,\" he pleaded. \"I'm not gonna lie to you -- I am a prostitute too \"\nBeware of your mind -- it is always trying ways and means, strategies, tactics, to remain as it is. It can wear masks, it can become religious, it can go to the church, it can read the Bibles and the Vedas and still it will find only ways and\nmeans to remain itself.\nZareen, Buddha's statement has been taken by people as if he has said, \"Life cannot be bliss.\" It is impossible. \"Life is misery and it is going to remain misery\n-- to be miserable is life's intrinsic quality,\" people have taken it that way. That is not true. I know it is not true.\nI say to you: your life is misery, but it need not be so. It is misery because you have not tried to transform it; you have not worked on it. It is misery because you are still unborn.\nIt is misery because the opportunity is being wasted, and you are not being\ncreative. It is misery because you are not behaving intelligently.\nBe intelligent. And I don't mean by 'intelligence' be intellectual -- intellectuals are not necessarily intelligent people, and intelligent people are not necessarily intellectuals.\nAlmost always the case is that the intellectual is only a pretend, he is pseudo; by being intellectual he is trying to convince himself and others that he is intelligent.\nWhat is the criterion of being an intelligent person? Only one criterion: if you can create bliss in your life you are intelligent -- otherwise there is no other way to prove it. If you can create a paradise around yourself, if you can remain in a constant cheerfulness, cheerfulness becomes just your very milieu, then you are intelligent.\nBe intelligent and life is bliss; be stupid and life is misery. It all depends on you. The third question\nOsho, Question 3\nAND THE MIND GOES BANANAS... \"SURRENDER, DO YOUR OWN THING.\" \"TRUST, LIVE YOUR LIFE...\"\nSLOWLY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING AND SOMETIMES IT FEELS VERY GOOD. BUT STILL I WANT TO KNOW.\nVaridhi,\nTHE MIND NEVER GOES BANANAS -- it is bananas. You say: SURRENDER, DO\nYOUR OWN THING. I will suggest you put just two words between these two: SURRENDER and then DO YOUR OWN THING. Because once you have\nsurrendered, you are not there, God is. Then doing your own thing is doing God's thing: Thy kingdom come, thy will be done.\nFirst dissolve yourself, then God is your you, then God is your self You have just missed those two simple words 'and then'.\nSurrender AND THEN do your own thing. Trust AND THEN live your own life.\nSurrender and trust are not two things; it is the same phenomenon. You can surrender only if you trust, and you can trust only if you surrender. They go hand in band. They are inseparable. If one happens, the other is bound to have already happened. Just those two words that are missing are creating trouble for you: and then.\nA man came to St. Augustine and asked him, \"I am illiterate, very old, not much life is left. I cannot go into great austerities; the energy is ebbing. I am just on the verge of death. I have walked many miles just to see you and ask you something very simple. I have not come to listen to great philosophy -- just something very simple, a single word will do. You just simply tell me a single word that I can keep in my heart and I can follow it for whatsoever of my life is left.\"\nIt is said St. Augustine closed his eyes... his disciples were very much puzzled. It had never happened before. Great theologians had come, great philosophers had visited; they had asked very complicated, very difficult questions, and Augustine was never known to meditate over those questions. His answers were immediate. \"What is he doing? This old villager's question -- and he is meditating?\"\nFor half an hour he meditated, and then he opened his eyes and he said, \"Then I can say only one thing: love and then whatsoever you do is right.\"\nRemember love. Love is the quintessence of the whole of religion, the very perfume of all the flowers that have bloomed in the name of religion -- Buddha, Krishna, Christ, Mohammed, Zarathustra, Lao Tzu, Kabir, Farid, Nanak, Meera -\n- all the flowers in all the ages that have ever bloomed, they have the same fragrance and that fragrance is love.\nIf you can love, then everything is allowed -- because a loving man cannot do anything wrong. Love is the only commandment. If love is not there, then even\nthose ten commandments are not going to help at all. Ten commandments are not needed; they are needed only because you are not ready to fulfill the first and the only commandment.\nThose ten commandments are just poor substitutes for the single commandment: love.\nAnd remember, love AND THEN whatsoever you do is good, is virtuous.\nThat's what I go on saying in different ways: surrender and then do your own thing.\nListening to me you can misunderstand, because doing your own thing has become the very flavour of the new generation. I am not saying the same thing. When I say do your own thing, I am not repeating a hippie slogan. When I am saying do your own thing, there is a condition preceding it: surrender, trust, AND THEN.… Otherwise, what are you going to do? Without surrender whatsoever you do will come out of your ego, will come out of your unconsciousness, will come out of your past. It CAN'T come from God, and it can't come from a conscious, alert being.\nAnd whatsoever comes from the unconscious is going to create more and more misery for you and for others. There is enough misery; there is no need for you to contribute more to it. There is more than enough. If you want to contribute something to it, please, first fulfill the basic requirement of surrender and trust.\nJust meditate for a moment... if the ego is not there, then who is doing? Then God is doing through you, then you are just a hollow bamboo. On his lips you become a flute --\nthe song is his. And then you will not feel so puzzled, Varidhi.\nYou say: SLOWLY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING AND\nSOMETIMES IT FEELS VERY GOOD.\nYou are going really mighty slow. You say: SLOWLY IT SEEMS TO ME... How can it seem slowly? Either you see it instantly, or you don't see it -- what do you mean by\n'slowly'? These things are not gradual. These things are breakthroughs, sudden, like lightning in the dark night.\nWhen I say something, if you are available in that moment, if you are in tune with me in that moment, there will be a lightning experience. A tremendous yes will arise in your heart... a flood of a new vision, of a new clarity, of a new transparency. You will see what is what, and in that very seeing, that which is wrong drops out of your hands -- and only the wrong has to be dropped; the right is always there. It cannot be dropped; it is only covered by the wrong. The wrong is a foreign element, the right is your natural being.\nYou say: SLOWLY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING...\nNo, it cannot happen slowly. It never happens slowly. If you listen to me you are bound to experience it, that you don't know anything at all. What do you know? I am not talking about engineering and medicine and geography and history; I am not talking about all that nonsense -- utilitarian nonsense. But what do you know of reality, of truth, of God, of love, of meditation? What do you know about this mysterious existence that surrounds you? What do you know about yourself? -- with whom you have lived from eternity and you are going to live for eternity. What do you know about the person who you are?\nWhen a great mathematician, P. D. Ouspensky, went to see a very strange mystic, George Gurdjieff, Ouspensky was already world-famous, and Gurdjieff was not known at all; nobody had heard about him. Ouspensky had already written one of the greatest books in the world, TERTIUM ORGANUM. It is said that there are only three great books in the world: the first was written by Aristotle, Organum, and the second was written by Bacon, NOVUM ORGANUM, and the third was written by P. D. Ouspensky, TERTIUM\nORGANUM. First principle, second principle, third principle -- third canon of thought, that is the meaning of Tertium Organum\nOuspensky declared in the beginning of the book that the third existed even before the first ever existed. And it is NOT just pride, it is not just ego -- it is true. He had discovered something of immense value; he had contributed to the world of mathematics, logic, metaphysics, something really valuable. He was known all over the world; the book was being translated into many many languages.\nAnd Gurdjieff was not known at all -- just a small group of people knew about him. And it was not easy to approach him either; he was not available publicly. Ouspensky had great difficulties and had to wait three months to see him, and had to try many people because only those who belonged to the inner circle of Gurdjieff were allowed to bring some new guest.\nAnd the day he was ushered into the presence of Gurdjieff, twelve people were sitting there. Gurdjieff in the middle and all the twelve surrounding him, and there was absolute silence. And the man who had brought Ouspensky, he also sat there and closed his eyes.\nNow, Ouspensky started feeling very restless; he was not even introduced. He started feeling a little embarrassed too: \"What is he doing here? And what are these people doing here, just sitting silently?\"\nHalf an hour passed... and now it was almost one hour passing. Ouspensky started thinking, \"What am I sitting here for?\" But he could not even leave, because it looked so impolite to disturb the silence. The silence was so tangible, like a cloud the silence was sitting there.\nAnd then Gurdjieff looked at Ouspensky, and he said, \"You are feeling very restless. It is natural -- you come from a restless world, you don't know the ways of silence. Why did you want to see me? Why have you been haunting me for three months?\"\nAnd Ouspensky said, \"I wanted to ask you a few questions.\" Gurdjieff gave him a blank sheet of paper and told him, \"Go into the other room and on the one side write whatsoever you know, and on the other side whatsoever you don't know. And then come back -- because I will answer only that which you don't know. If you already know it, why bother about it?\"\nIt was a cold Moscow night, the snow was falling, and Ouspensky remembers, \"Going into the other room, I started perspiring. For the first time, with such emphasis, I was made aware that I know nothing. I wanted to write something, just to save my prestige, that I know this, that. I thought it over, round and round, but basically I knew nothing. I thought: Do I know anything about love? I have heard much, I have read much -- but any experience? because that man is not going to let it pass easily. He will ask, 'Any experience?' \" And he had seen those eyes which can go to the very core of your being:\n\"You cannot deceive that man.\n\"Do I know anything about meditation? Do I know anything about God? Do I know anything of any real significance?'\nHe waited and waited and he could not find anything. And finally he came out and gave the paper back -- as blank as before -- and said, \"Excuse me, I don't know anything. I know nothing. I have been a fool up to now. I had always believed that I knew this and I knew that. You have shattered me in a single blow.\"\nGurdjieff looked at Ouspensky, and his eyes were those of benediction. He said, \"Then you are accepted -- because only those who know that they know not can be accepted in my circle, because only they are capable of learning.\"\nVaridhi, know that you know nothing -- and don't go slowly. It is not a question of gradual discovery: it is a sudden lightning experience. EACH morning I am trying to show it to you, shouting at you that you don't know anything -- anything that is of any relevance, anything that is of any value, anything that is really going to transform you, anything that you will be able to carry beyond death to the other shore.\nBut Varidhi says: SLOWLY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING\nAND SOMETIMES IT FEELS VERY GOOD.\nEven that -- a little glimpse, a gradual thing, just a little... as if a window opens and closes, but a little breeze comes in, or a ray of the sun -- still THAT feels good! If it feels good, go deeper into it, go deeper into ignorance, go deeper into not knowing, go deeper and deeper into a state where knowledgeability is just garbage. And great will be your experience -- of great joy and freedom, because knowledge is a bondage, borrowed knowledge is a bondage. One's own experience is not knowledge: it is wisdom, it is freedom.\nAnd finally you say: BUT STILL I WANT TO KNOW.\nThat's good! Start from the state of not knowing and you will become capable of knowing. Start from the clean slate and let God write something on it. Efface all that you know. Before God, be just nude, innocent, ignorant, a child. And YOU\nWILL know. We are here to know, but that knowing does not come through scriptures, that knowing comes through silence. And the knowledgeable mind cannot be silent. It is so full of knowledge, so full of thoughts, it cannot empty itself.\nEmpty yourself, Varidhi. Empty yourself of all knowledge, dreams and desires. Throw all this rotten furniture out of yourself. Create a pure space, and in that pure space you become capable of attracting the ultimate towards you; you become a magnetic force.\nYou become the host, and God comes as a guest. The fourth question\nQuestion 4\nOSHO, FEELING A RAPIDLY GROWING UNEASINESS ABOUT MY STATE AS A NON-SANNYASIN. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU: WHAT IS YOUR ART? HOW\nCOULD YOU FIND THE LOOPHOLES IN MY MIND SO EASILY AND IN WHAT\nWAY DID YOU BYPASS MY WELL-DEVELOPED EGO? WHEN I ARRIVED TEN\nDAYS AGO I FELT RATHER BALANCED, GRATEFUL, YES, FOR WHAT YOU\nHAD SHOWN ME ALREADY, BUT NEVERTHELESS FULL OF COURAGE TO\nFACE AND RESIST ANY UNTIMELY ATTEMPT THAT WOULD SANNYASIN\nME. BUT LOOK AT ME NOW: WANDERING AROUND IN THE ASHRAM OFF-BALANCE, EYES FULL OF AWE, CRYING TIME AND AGAIN AT COMPLETELY\nUNPREDICTABLE MOMENTS AND SHOWING ALL THE SIGNS OF ONE\nWHO IS\nIN LOVE. OSHO, I LOVE YOU, SO WHAT CAN I DO? AND HOW DID YOU\nMANAGE?\nHein Kray,\nI WILL TELL YOU ONE STORY -- that's how I manage, that's my art.\nHaggarty ran a red light and ploughed headlong into a car driven by Father Cogan. The auto turned over three times and the priest thrown from the vehicle lay stunned beside the road.\nHaggarty rushed over and said, \"I am terribly sorry, Father!\" \"Saints above!\" said the shaken priest. \"You almost killed me!\"\n\"Here,\" said Haggarty, \"I have got a little sacramental Jack Daniels. Take some and you will feel a lot better!\"\nFather Cogan took a couple of large swigs and continued his tirade. \"What were you thinking about, man? You nearly launched me into eternity!\"\n\"I am sorry, Father,\" said Haggarty. \"Take a few more sips, it will ease your nerves.\"\nAfter the priest had almost finished the entire bottle, he said, \"Why don't you have a drink?\"\n\"No thanks, your reverence,\" said Haggarty, \"I will just sit here and wait for the police!\"\nSo I am just waiting till the day, which is coming closer and closer... it is the nineteenth of April that you are going to be assassinated.\nSomething really beautiful is happening to you. All that ego that seems so strong is not so strong; it is just your belief that keeps it alive. Once you start understanding, it starts dying. It is all kinds of inhibitions that keep your tears\nrepressed. You have been told again and again that you are not a woman, you are a man -- be a boy, don't be a girl.\nCrying and weeping is for girls, not for you.\nNature has not made any distinction: there are as many tear glands in male eyes as there are in female eyes. Tears are needed; tears do miracles. But repressing the tears is a subtle strategy to repress emotions. Tears are deep down connected with the heart. Heads don't cry, only hearts. Repressing the tears is a subtle trick to repress the heart.\nYou have lived in the head, high and proud, thinking your ego very strong. Now you have fallen in a wrong company... these are mad people here. Anybody can start crying any moment! Crying is thought to be sacred here, because tears come directly from the heart. There is no other prayer which is more beautiful than tears.\nAnd it is not that tears come only when you are in suffering, pain and sadness. That too is a wrong idea that has been given to you -- that tears come only when you are in pain. No.\nTears come whenever anything is overflowing -- it may be pain, it may be pleasure, it may be agony, it may be ecstasy -- anything overflowing. Tears are symbols of something overflowing.\nAnd, Kray, something wants to overflow, something wants to burst forth. You have repressed a long long time all that is beautiful. Now, being in my Buddhafield, it is impossible to remain in your senses; it is impossible NOT to fall in love. You don't have a heart of stone; you have a heart which is beating with God, full of love -- repressed, but ready to burst forth any moment, waiting for its opportunity. And that opportunity has come.\nSannyas is a new way of life, a new style, a new philosophy -- to live totally: with tears, with smiles, with love, with laughter, with anger, with hate, with compassion -- to live in all the dimensions of the mind, being, and to live totally. And the miracle is that if you live totally, slowly slowly, all that is negative starts disappearing of its own accord. And finally, ultimately, only that which has always been called virtue remains; the evil evaporates.\nNo repression is recommended, no suppression is supported. I teach you to be\nnatural, and that's why you have fallen in love with me. It is really an indirect way of falling in love with your own nature -- I am just an excuse. Just go on sipping a little more, only three days are left. Empty the bottle, so the day you take sannyas, or as you say...\nI WAS FULL OF COURAGE TO FACE AND RESIST ANY UNTIMELY ATTEMPT\nTHAT WOULD SANNYASIN ME. You can call it 'sannyasinate', and that will be far better, because it is an assassination. Drink as much as you can so the death is not painful.\nDrink of me as much as you can before your sannyas happens, so that it REALLY\nhappens. And it is going to happen really, because you had not come to be a sannyasin.\nYou had come with all kinds of resistances; you were afraid that it might happen untimely. You wanted to take it by your own decision, in your own time.\nWhenever one becomes a sannyasin by his own decision, in his own time, he misses the whole point. Let it be a happening, not a doing on your part. Surrender cannot be done: it can only be gratefully accepted. And that's what is happening. You are fortunate, you are blessed.\nThe fifth question Question 5\nWHY AM I SO MUCH AFRAID OF HELL?\nDhara,\nTHERE IS NO NEED TO BE AFRAID OF HELL, because there are many hells\n-- and there is an Indian hell too. And everybody is asked at the gate, \"Which hell do you want to choose?\" Choose the Indian, and you will be happy ever afterwards.\nFellow dies and is met by Saint Peter at the Gate. \"Before you can get in you\nmust spend six months in hell. You have a choice: either the regular hell or the Indian hell.\"\n\"What is the difference?\" asked the fellow.\n\"In the regular hell,\" explained Saint Peter, \"they tie you to a stake, pour gasoline over you, strike the match, and you burn for twelve hours and then you rest for twelve hours.\"\n\"And the Indian hell?\"\n\"They tie you to a stake, pour gasoline over you, set you on fire and you burn for twelve hours and then rest for twelve hours.\"\n\"But I don't see the difference,\" said the man.\n\"If I were you,\" advised Saint Peter, \"I would take the Indian hell -- somebody usually forgets the matches or the gasoline...\"\nSo you need not be so much afraid -- wise people always choose the Indian hell. But, Dhara, I can understand why you are afraid. Fear is a natural instinct in man, and it has been exploited by the priests down the ages. Fear and greed are two sides of the same coin, and they have exploited both.\nIt is out of fear that they have created hell, just to exploit your fear instinct. If you can be made really afraid then you will be in the hands of the priests. Or if you can be made really very greedy for heaven, then too you will be in the hands of the priests. The priests have been telling you that \"We will protect you from hell and we will help you to enter into heaven. All that you need is just to remain obedient to us.\nAnd because of fear and greed, man has remained obedient to the priests. Parents have used... that's how everybody is brought up, in fear and greed. If you do one thing, you are punished; if you do something else, you are rewarded. It is the SAME story -- in the school, college, university, the same story repeated, again and again: punished for something, rewarded for something else. It is greed and fear which are being enforced again and again.\nBy the time you come from the university, you have been conditioned, totally conditioned. Your whole life is going to remain the same if you don't become\nalert, if you don't become aware of the whole situation, if you don't gather courage to get out of the prison that has been made by the society for you. That prison consists of greed and fear.\nThere is no hell! regular or Indian. And there is no heaven either. Hell and heaven are psychological states, not geographical situations. Forget all about that childish nonsense.\nYou can be in hell right now, or in heaven right now. And the only way to be in heaven is to be without mind, and the only way to be in hell is to be only the mind and nothing else.\nThe constant traffic of thoughts is your misery. If this traffic disappears and you are left silent, alone, with no thought surrounding you, in that moment of peace and silence and stillness YOU ARE in heaven -- you are heaven! That's what meditation is all about.\nDhara, you need not be worried, need not be afraid of any heaven or hell. You just meditate, become more and more silent, become more and more detached from the mind, become more and more disidentified from your thought process. Just be a witness! Go on witnessing whatsoever passes in the mind, and the very process of witnessing has the whole secret in it. Slowly slowly, you will see less and less thoughts are coming to you, because you are no more welcoming them, and because you don't care, and because you don't cling, and because you don't choose this against that, and because you are no more judgemental. Good thoughts, bad thoughts, all are alike. Great thoughts, small thoughts, all are alike. You remain aloof, distant, a watcher on the hill.\nSlowly slowly, less and less traffic... and one day suddenly intervals start happening. An interval for a few seconds, and you will have a taste of the unknown. And once you have tasted something of no-mind, your real life begins. Then all is joy, then all is benediction.\nBut to be meditative, great intelligence is needed. You can't go on being the way you are, you can't go on being stupid. You have to be very alert!\nTowards the end of World War II, when the Italians were fighting the Germans, the Nazi soldiers came up with a scheme to kill many of Mussolini's men. They simply yelled,\n\"Hey, Luigi!\" When an Italian infantryman stuck his head up and answered, \"Si?\" boom!\nHe was dead.\nThat's all the Krauts did: \"Luigi?\" \"Si?\" Boom!\nAfter thousands of Italians had been wiped out, they decided to retaliate. They figured that every German's name was Hans. So an Italian captain shouted, \"Hey, Hans!\"\nSilence.\n\"Hey, Hans!\" he repeated. \"Is that you, Luigi?\" \"Si!\"\nBoom!\nThe sixth question Question 6\nWHY IS THE MODERN MAN FEELING SO LONELY?\nDhammo,\nMAN HAS ALWAYS FELT LONELY, because man basically IS alone. We are born alone, and we will die alone. And in the middle we can only pretend to be together.\nAloneness remains unaffected. It becomes an undercurrent, it goes underground.\nMan has always been alone, but modern man is feeling it more for a certain reason --\nbecause modern man for the first time has time enough to think about his own self. In the past, the struggle for bread and butter was so much that it kept people occupied from the early morning to the late night, and then too they were not able to feed themselves and their children enough.\nAnd that's exactly the case in the East even today. Modern man in an Indian village is not feeling lonely. He has no time to feel anything at all! He feels hungry, not lonely; he needs a shelter, a house. These things -- feelings of loneliness -- he cannot afford. These feelings start surfacing only when a society becomes a little affluent.\nWhen people are well-fed, well-clothed, well-sheltered, well-employed -- when the ordinary necessities of life are fulfilled, then the real problems of life arise. Then one suddenly becomes aware that \"I am lonely, even in the crowd I am lonely.\" This is a higher need. There is a hierarchy of needs.\nFirst physical needs come. If physical needs are not fulfilled, you will not have psychological needs. Once physical needs are fulfilled, then psychological needs arise --\nthose are higher. One thinks of music, poetry, painting; one thinks of art, aesthetics --\nthose are higher needs. One thinks of Shakespeare, Milton, Kali Das, Rabindranath, Kahlil Gibran; one thinks of Wagner, Beethoven, Leonardo, Van Gogh, Picasso These are higher needs.\nA hungry man cannot understand Beethoven. Howsoever great the music is, it cannot fill his stomach. And he is so hungry that he would like to kill the musician rather than listen to the music. He will not bother about great works of art; rather, he will be interested in Karl Marx and his Communist Manifesto. Once physical needs are fulfilled, psychological needs arise.\nYou will be surprised to know: I receive many letters from Soviet Russia. They cannot even write to me directly, because then those letters will never come. First the Russian government and then the Indian government.… If there were only the Indian government there would be a chance. But the Russian government and they are very methodical. So those letters are given to visitors,\ntourists, to Switzerland, and then those letters are dropped in London or in Berlin or in Paris, then they come to me.\nMany people write that they would like to come here, but it is impossible. My books are being read, but in an underground way. They are circulating from one person to another...\nbut officially you cannot carry my books in a communist country.\nRussia is coming closer and closer to that point where physical needs are fulfilled, and psychological needs will arise, and spiritual needs are the highest in the hierarchy. Once psychological needs are fulfilled -- you have heard great music, you have seen great paintings, you have read great poetry -- then what? Sooner or later, those things also prove to be games, beautiful games, but games all the same.\nThen the ultimate starts knocking on your doors, and when the ultimate knocks on your doors you feel REALLY LONELY, lonely in this whole universe. And that is the beginning of meditation. If you feel lonely and if your feeling of loneliness has some penetration, intensity, passion in it, then you start meditating.\nMeditation is a way to come to terms with one's loneliness, to have an encounter with one's own loneliness rather than escaping from it, diving deep into it and seeing what exactly it is. And then you are in for a surprise. If you go into your loneliness you will be surprised: at the very center of it it is not lonely at all -- there resides aloneness which is a totally different phenomenon.\nThe circumference consists of loneliness and the center consists of aloneness. The circumference consists of solitariness and the center of solitude. And once you have known your beautiful aloneness, you will be a totally different person -\n- you will never feel lonely. Even in the mountains or in the deserts where you will be absolutely alone, you will not feel lonely -- because in your aloneness you will know God is with you, in your aloneness you are so deeply rooted in God that who cares whether there is somebody else outside or not? You are so full inside, so rich inside.…\nRight now, even in the crowd you are lonely. And I am saying: if you know your aloneness, even in your loneliness you will not be lonely.\nBut modern man IS suffering...\nIra quit college, got himself a backpack and began hitchhiking around the United States.\nAfter he had been gone more than a year, he telephoned home. \"Hello, Ma. How are you?\"\n\"Just fine, son. When are you coming home? I will fix you some chopped liver and chicken soup and a beautiful pot roast.\n\"I am still pretty far away.\"\n\"Oh, son,\" cried the desperate woman, \"just come home and I will fix your favourite oatmeal cookies.\"\n\"I don't like oatmeal cookies!\" said the boy. \"You don't?\" asked the woman.\n\"Say,\" said Ira, \"is this Century 57682?\" \"No!\"\n\"Then I must have the wrong number.\"\n\"Does that mean you are not coming?\" asked the woman.\nPeople are really lonely. The woman asked, \"Does that mean you are not coming?\" Man has never been so lonely because man has never been able to fulfill the lower desires, needs before. For the first time in the West, man has been able to fulfill all lower desires; now the higher desires are asserting themselves. This is a good sign. It looks like a curse -\n- it is not -- it is a blessing in disguise.\nThe days of the West turning East have come. The misery is that the East is turning West.\nMan seems to be so foolish. By the time the West turns East, you will find the East has become West. And this way the sorry-go-round continues.…\nYou can see it here. Why don't you see so many Indians here? This is not their need.\nWhat I am sharing here has nothing to do with them. The desire for it has not yet arisen.\nEven when sometimes they come, they don't ask about meditation, they don't ask\nabout sannyas, they don't ask about love -- no, not at all.\nJust the other day I received a letter saying, \"Why don't you open a few hospitals, a few schools...? Why don't you teach your sannyasins to serve the poor?\" The poor have been served down the ages and they are still poor. Poverty cannot be destroyed by serving the poor -- that much is absolutely certain. Poverty can be destroyed only if a new vision of life is given to them. They are poor because their philosophy makes them poor; they are poor because their very attitude towards life keeps them poor. They are poor BECAUSE\nof themselves! They don't need compassion: they need education. They don't need service: they need to be shaken into awareness. But nobody wants to be shaken out of their own dreams and sleep. Hence they are angry at me.\nHospitals are there; a few more can be added. Schools are there; a few more can be added. But that is NOT going to help. That is like throwing colour with teaspoons into the ocean: it is not going to colour the ocean.\nWe have to change the whole fundamental. Why has India remained so poor for so many centuries? The reason must be very deep. The reason is that the Indian mind is life-negative. The reason is that the Indian mind lives in a division: this world and that. The reason is that the Indian mind is against materialism. If you are against materialism you will remain poor, and that is your own decision; then it is your own fate decided by you yourself.\nA real spirituality has to be based on scientific materialism. Matter and consciousness are not two things, just as body and consciousness are not two things -- aspects of one phenomenon. This world has to be loved, Then this world yields, gives its secrets to you.\nThe West has committed one mistake, that there is no spiritualism, only materialism is enough. So their basic needs are fulfilled, but the higher needs are torturing them, making them commit suicide or go mad. And the East has committed the other mistake: that spiritualism can exist without materialism, so the East has become like a ghost, a soul without a body. The West is a body without a soul, a corpse: and the East is a ghost, a soul without a body.\nMy effort here is to somehow bring East and West closer and closer, so everybody can have a body and everybody can have a soul. Materialism and spiritualism should be two aspects of one life vision. Then the poverty will\ndisappear. The earth is rich enough, and man's intelligence is there -- we can make it even richer.\nBut you don't see Indians here, not many, very few. Those few are those who are intelligent enough to see that even if lower desires are fulfilled, nothing will be fulfilled.\nThose few are born in the East, but they are really contemporary, they are modern. They have seen what has happened in the West. And even if India becomes rich, this is going to happen: the West is not happy; even if India becomes rich it is not going to be happy either. So happiness has to be searched for in some other dimension.\nThat dimension is: entering your loneliness till you come upon aloneness. The first glimpse of aloneness is satori. The second glimpse, the second satori: you become established in your aloneness, rooted. And the third, the ultimate satori, what we call samadhi in India, is the state when you are no more separate from your aloneness -- you ARE your aloneness.\nAnd then one starts overflowing like a fountain. Out of that aloneness arises the fragrance of love, and out of that aloneness arises creativity -- because oUt of that aloneness God starts flowing. You become a hollow bamboo... he starts singing. But the song is always his.\nThe Fish in the Sea is Not Thirsty Chapter #7\nChapter title: It is Morning Swan, Wake Up! 17 April 1979 am in Buddha Hall\nArchive code: 7904170\nShortTitle:\nFISH07\nAudio:\nYes Video: No Length:\n99\nmins\nSWAN, I'D LIKE YOU TO TELL ME YOUR WHOLE STORY! WHERE YOU FIRST APPEARED, AND WHAT DARK SAND YOU ARE GOING TOWARD,\nAND WHERE YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT, AND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.…\nIT'S MORNING, SWAN, WAKE UP, CLIMB IN THE AIR, FOLLOW ME!\nI KNOW OF A COUNTRY THAT SPIRITUAL FLATNESS DOES NOT CONTROL, NOR CONSTANT DEPRESSION, AND THOSE ALIVE ARE NOT AFRAID TO DIE.\nTHERE WILD FLOWERS COME UP THROUGH THE LEAFY FLOOR, AMD THE FRAGRANCE OF 'I AM HE' FLOATS ON THE WIND.\nTHERE THE BEE OF THE HEART STAYS DEEP INSIDE THE FLOWER, AND CARES FOR NO OTHER THING.\nDON'T GO OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE TO SEE FLOWERS. MY FRIEND, DON'T BOTHER WITH THAT EXCURSION. INSIDE YOUR BODY THERE ARE FLOWERS.\nONE FLOWER HAS A THOUSAND PETALS. THAT WILL DO FOR A PLACE TO SIT.\nSITTING THERE YOU WILL HAVE A GLIMPSE OF BEAUTY INSIDE THE BODY AND OUT OF IT,\nBEFORE GARDENS AND AFTER GARDENS.\nMAN IS AWAKE AND YET NOT AWAKE. His wakefulness is very thin, his wakefulness is almost of no use. He is not asleep, that is true, but he is not awake either --\nhe is in limbo, in the middle. He has awakened from the world of animals, but he is fast asleep to the world of gods.\nMan is a transitory period. Man is not a being but a becoming -- on the way. The past is left behind and the future is not attained yet. Hence the agony, the anguish: man is torn apart. The past pulls him back. To be an animal again seems to be pleasant, and it is, because it has not the agony of man and the anguish and the anxiety of man.\nIf you watch the animals you will feel jealous. Walt Whitman has written it exactly in his diaries that: \"Whenever I see animals, I feel jealous. We have missed something.\"\nWe have not missed really, but the peace, the calm, the collectedness of the animal is lost.\nThe animal is happy because he is unaware -- unaware of death, unaware of the problems of life. The animal is happy because there is no consciousness. Consciousness first brings pain, because suddenly you become aware of a thousand and one problems facing you.\nYou have to encounter them, you have to solve them or dissolve them. All peace disappears.\nBut human consciousness is still worthwhile. And I don't agree with Walt Whitman, I agree with Socrates who say.: \"I would like to be a discontented Socrates rather than a contented pig.\" The statement of Socrates is of immense value. It has to be understood by every seeker, because the goal is ahead; there is no going back. The pig may look contented -- because he is not aware, not really because he is contented. But to know discontent one needs consciousness.\nThere is something ahead; something more has to happen. Something HAS happened, but only partially. Look back and you find the pig contented; look ahead, and you see Buddhas contented. You can become a Buddha! A Buddha means one who is conscious and contented. The pig is one who is unconscious and contented. And the man is just between the two: a little bit conscious, just a little bit. Conscious enough to be aware of the pain of life and the misery and the suffering, but not conscious enough to be aware of the ecstasies that life makes available.\nJust a little consciousness is enough to be aware of pain. But much more awareness is needed, much more consciousness is needed, to be aware of the deeper realms of your inner kingdom.\nMan is in a kind of drunkenness: awake and yet not awake. Man sees a little bit, and yet everything seems to be dark, just shadows moving in the dark are felt. But nothing is absolutely clear; there is no clarity, no transparency, no light.\nThis is the state of man. And we cannot go back because there is no possibility of going back. Man tries hard to go back -- through sex, through food, through alcohol, through drugs -- man tries somehow to drown this little bit of consciousness that has arisen in him. But it comes back again and again, because whatsoever has been Learnt has been learnt for ever -- it cannot be unlearnt.\nIt has happened in your being. Now there is no way to discard it. You have to live with it.\nThe only possibility is to move ahead, to grow more into awareness: if it has brought pain, then go deep into pain, but become more and more aware. Use pain as an object of awareness, as an object of meditation.\nYou are sad -- be aware. Let sadness become your meditation. You are angry -- be aware.\nYou are in love -- be aware. Use all possibilities, all opportunities to be more and more aware. Slowly slowly, the momentum gathers, and one day something explodes in you.\nThat explosion is known in the East as the flowering of the one-thousand- petalled lotus --\nKabir will talk about this lotus in these sutras. And Kabir is talking about you; first a few metaphors have to be understood.\nThe swan is one of the metaphors most used by the Eastern mystics. The swan lives beyond the Himalayas, his home is beyond the Himalayas, in the Lake Mansarovar. The Lake Mansarovar is the purest lake in the world -- very rarely does a human being reach there -- uncontaminated, unpolluted, surrounded by the Himalayan beauty, virgin peaks.\nThe swan is born there, lives there, but when it becomes TOO cold the swan has to come to this side of the Himalayas, to the plains. And sometimes it happens: a swan forgets the way to go back. And sometimes it happens: a swan simply forgets that he has a home somewhere, starts living by the side of dirty rivers, dirty ponds, muddy places.\nHence, the swan became a tremendously potent metaphor for man. Man comes from God but has forgotten from where he comes, who he is. Man comes from God, from the holiest of the holies, and goes on living by the side of dirty rivers, muddy pools of water.\nOf course, he cannot be contented here, but he knows no other place to go. He is lost.\nThis world seems to be the only world.\nThe Eastern mystics use the metaphor of the swan for man. Kabir says: HANSA KARO PURATAN BAT.\nSwan, it would be good if we remember\nthe primordial days,\nthe days when you had not left the home yet. It would be good if we remember the home.\nSWAN, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL ME YOUR WHOLE STORY!\nTell me your whole story! But if somebody asks you what story you have to tell, birth seems to be the beginning -- which it is not -- and death seems to be the end\n-- which it is not. Birth and death, both are episodes in your long life, and they have happened millions of times.\nThe true story can begin only when you remember your real home, from where you come. And the real story can never end, because the real story is not only your story -- it is the story of consciousness, of evolving consciousness, of evolution. It is not only your story -- it is God's story. There is no beginning and there is no end.\nOnce you become full of this nostalgia for the origins, then you will be surprised that you have become aware of the goal too -- because the origin is the goal, the source is the goal.\nWe have to go to the same space from where we come, then the circle is perfect. And in that perfection is beauty, in that perfection is blessing, that perfection is benediction.\nSWAN, I'D LIKE YOU TO TELL ME YOUR WHOLE STORY!\nONLY A BUDDHA CAN TELL HIS WHOLE STORY, only one who has\nbecome totally awakened. You can talk about your dreams, but that is not your story. You are dreaming, desiring, thinking, but you know nothing. And the less you know, the more you believe in your dreams -- because one has to keep oneself occupied. The less you know, the more you desire -- just to avoid your inner ignorance and emptiness. You rush in all directions; you go on rushing, you don't give yourself a little rest, because the lest seems to be explosive, dangerous.\nAnd rest is meditation. Finding at least one or two hours out of the hustle and bustle of life, sitting silently doing nothing, you may start moving inwards, you\nmay start remembering something, the origins -- because deep down the memory of where you come from is still there. You may have forgotten it but it is there, maybe covered with rubbish, all kinds of rubbish, but that rubbish can be removed.\nThat's what meditation is all about: removing the rubbish -- of thoughts, memories, dreams, desires, imaginations. And if you can remove all this rubbish that your head has gathered, your heart will start remembering. And once the source is remembered, the goal is known -- because, let me repeat, the source is the goal. We have to reach the same place from where we come.\nSWAN, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL ME YOUR WHOLE STORY!\nThe original has some beauty in it:\nHANSA KARO PURATAN BAT --\nLet us talk of the old days, swan.\nLet us remember the old days, the ancient days. Let us remember the beginnings.\nLet us talk again about the source.\nAnd Kabir is talking to his disciples, remember. He is calling his disciples swans\n-- HANSA.\nWHERE YOU FIRST APPEARED, AND WHAT DARK SAND YOU ARE GOING TOWARD...\n\"From where do you come, and to where are you going? Let us be very particular about it.\" That is the work of a Master: to remind the disciple from where he comes and to where he is going. Otherwise, people go on moving with the crowd... wherever others are going. People remain imitators; people remain just followers, followers of the blind -- the blind following the blind.\nYour parents were following their parents, you are follow-ing your parents, your children will follow you -- and nobody knows from where you come and where you are going.\nAnd everybody is trying... not at all aware of what really your need is, what is going to fulfill you. More money? More houses? More power? Are these things going to help?\nHave they helped others?\nJust be a little more observant. There is an ancient story: The last initiation was going to be given to the disciple. The Master said, \"Your last initiation will be given in a very indirect way.\" The disciple had passed all the hurdles that the Master had put in his way; he had proved his mettle. Now the last initiation... and once he has passed the last initiation, he will be declared enlightened The disciple touched the feet of the Master and said, \"I am ready. Just order me and I will do whatsoever needs to be done.\"\nThe Master said, \"You will have to go to the King, and go early in the morning; be the first visitor to the King. Because the King has a habit: whosoever comes to him first, whatsoever he asks, the King gives. But the country is so rich that it is very rare that anybody goes. Years pass and nobody goes to ask for anything. But don't take any chances -- be there very early. The King comes in the morning into his garden, as the sun rises the King enters the garden -- be there. And he will ask you, 'What do you want?'\nAnd whatsoever you want, ask him.\"\nThe disciple could not understand what kind of initiation this last one was. But the order had to be followed. He went. He didn't take any chance: three o'clock early in the morning he was waiting for the King.\nAs the sun was rising, the King entered. The young man bowed down to the King; the King said, \"Have you come to ask for something? You can ask for anything! Whatsoever you ask, I will give it to you.\"\nA great desire possessed the young man. He was a poor man, had come from a very poor family, \"And the King says whatsoever...?\" To be certain, he asked again, \"What do you mean by 'whatsoever'?\"\nThe King said, \"Exactly that I mean -- whatsoever. Even if you demand my kingdom I will give it to you. You can ask for as much money as you want...\"\nThe poor young man could not think much. He thought, \"Maybe ten thousand rupees will do.\" But a desire came that \"Why ten thousand? You may never get such a chance again -\n- why not one hundred thousand?\"\nAnd then another desire, and desires upon desires... because mind constantly asks for more. So whatsoever he decided, the mind was still asking for more.\nThe King said, \"It seems you are not yet ready to ask. I will go for my morning walk, meanwhile you decide. And when I return, whatsoever you ask will be given to you.\"\nThat half an hour was a torture. He went on and on, \"I can ask for this and that, and a golden chariot, and so many millions of rupees, and so much land -- I will create a small kingdom of my own.\"\nDesires and dreams... and the King came; that half hour had passed so fast. The King was standing there and he said, \"Young man, have you not decided yet?\"\nAnd then suddenly the young man thought, \"Whatsoever I ask will be less than the King has, so why not ask for all? Be finished with the figures!\"\nSo he said, \"Sir, if you are so willing to give, I ask for every-thing! -- all that you have.\nYour whole kingdom, all your riches, your palaces -- everything. You simply get out of the palace! And you cannot go back in. You may take something. You simply get out --\nforget all about it. I can allow you only these clothes that you are wearing.\" Even that he did reluctantly; even that much he would have less.\nThe King fell on his knees, started praying to God, tears rolling down from his eyes -- of great joy, ecstasy! And he was thanking God saying \"I have been waiting for such a man.\nHow long I waited! But finally you heard my prayer, and now he has come and I am free of all this nonsense. Thank you! You heard my prayer, although it has been so long and I had to wait so long, but still you heard it. I am grateful.\"\nWhen he was saying these things to God, the young man was standing there and he started thinking, \"What is the matter? If this man is feeling so happy renouncing the kingdom, what am I getting into? If this man has been praying for thirty years, as he is saying, 'Send a man who can take my whole kingdom, who can ask for my whole kingdom!' -- if for thirty years he has been praying, then it is not worthwhile at all. I am getting into unnecessary trouble.\"\nHe also fell on his knees, touched the King's feet and said, \"Sir, I am a young man -- I am a young fool. Please excuse me. I don't want anything. Your prayer to God, your thankfulness to God has finished my whole mind. I am going back to the forest to my Master.\"\nThe King tried to persuade him, \"Don't go. Just have a look. Come into the palace! I will not only give you my palace, my kingdom, my riches, but my beautiful daughter also.\nCome and just have a look!\"\nBut the young man said, \"I cannot stay here, not even a single moment -- because the mind can betray me. An insight has happened, and I am thankful to you just as you are thankful to God. I am finished!\"\nAnd when the young man reached back to his Master and told the whole story, the Master said, \"Your last initiation is over. Now nothing will ever make a slave of you. Now you are alert, conscious, free. You have passed -- I am happy. I was watching from here, and when you had asked for the whole kingdom, my heart was crying. I was thinking, 'So, fifteen years' work on this fool, and all finished.' You can't imagine my happiness,\" said the Master, \"that you are back, that you could see the point, that you were observant.\"\nBe observant, just watch.… People HAVE money, people have great palaces, people have all that you can desire -- just watch, just see: are they happy? are they contented? They may be more happy than you are and more discontented than you are -- then don't follow them. They are blind! They have followed other blind people. Don't follow them, don't imitate the crowd.\nThe really religious person is one who gets out of the entanglement of the mass psychology, of the mass hypnosis. The mass conditions you: rebel against it; go out of this mass conditioning, become an individual. Then only can you re- member from where you come, because only then will you know who you are.\nRight now you know you are a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Christian. You are not all these things: you are neither white nor black, you are neither man nor woman -- you are just a pure consciousness with no adjectives attached to it. There is no frame to this consciousness; this consciousness is infinite. If you drop the mass conditionings you will be coming closer home.\nHANSA KARO PURATAN BAT --\nLet us talk of those ancient times when we were at the source.\nSWAN, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL ME YOUR WHOLE STORY! WHERE YOU FIRST APPEARED, AND WHAT DARK SAND\nYOU ARE GOING TOWARD...\nYOU ARE COMING FROM LIGHT, SO wherever you are going you must be going towards darkness. And that's what happens.\nA child has more light in his being; as he grows he becomes darker and darker and darker. By the time he is old he is just a dark night of the soul and nothing else. A child is more luminous, is more intelligent, more alert. And as time passes and dust gathers on him, layers and layers of dust, and all his intelligence disappears, he becomes mediocre.\nHe starts behaving in stupid ways, because he falls a victim to the stupid crowd that surrounds him. He is helpless -- he has to listen to the parents, to the teachers, to the politicians. They are the great leaders, they are the great priests -- they know, and they all say, \"We love you. Listen to us otherwise you will go astray. Obey us, otherwise you will go astray.\"\nObedience has been one of the greatest calamities that has befallen humanity. One should be capable of disobeying. I am not saying to make disobeying your\nreligion; I am simply saying one should be capable of disobeying. In fact, the person who is capable of disobeying is also capable of obeying. The person who is only capable of obeying, his obedience carries no value. The person who cannot say no, his yes is always impotent.\nOnly the person who can say no, his yes has power, meaning, significance. He says yes only when he means it.\nAnd one should be alert enough to say no to all that takes you deeper and deeper into the mire of darkness, of blindness, of superstitiousness. And one should be capable of saying yes to anything that takes you towards the light, towards love, towards life. And it is up to you! If you say yes to darkness you will be saying no to light. If you move towards darkness you will have to keep your back towards the light. And it is only a question of a hundred-and-eighty-degree turn -\n- a hundred-and-eighty-degree turn and you are in front of the light that you have been searching and seeking. But your ways, your methods, your habits, your patterns of thinking, were all taking you towards darker and darker realms of life.\nWHERE YOU FIRST APPEARED, AND WHAT DARK SAND YOU ARE GOING TOWARD,\nAND WHERE YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT...\nThis is a night in which you are living, and the life that you call life is nothing but a sleep\n-- full of dreams. Sometimes you even dream that you are awake; that too is a dream.\nJust the other night I was reading a story:\nA man came to the lake and told the fisherman, \"I am Jesus Christ!\"\nThe fisherman looked at him and laughed, and he said, \"Jesus has been dead for two thousand years -- are you mad or something?\"\nThe man said, But I am Jesus Christ. Have you not heard that after he was crucified he was resurrected -- and since then I have not died? Have you ever\nheard when Jesus died after resurrection?\"\nThe fisherman thought, \"Either he is very drunk or gone nuts.\" He said, \"Then you will have to prove it: Jesus did miracles...\nAnd the man was very happy; he said, \"Yes, what miracle do you want me to do?\"\nThe fisherman said, \"Then walk on the lake.\"\nAnd the madman walked... and drowned. The fisherman jumped in, somehow pulled him out; asked him, \"What happened?\"\nHe said, \"That time my shoes did not have any holes. Two thousand years of wandering on the earth, and the shoes are full of holes -- that's what happened.\"\nMad people have their own logic. Blind people have their own logic. People who are fast asleep have their own logic -- logic that supports their sleep.\nOne man suddenly became certain that he was dead. There was no way to prove that he was not, so he was taken to a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist tried hard to convince him in every possible way, all kinds of arguments -- but how can you prove to a man...? He said,\n\"But I am dead -- with whom are you talking? I am not, I am no more. This is not a dialogue, this is a monologue -- you are talking with yourself, you have gone mad.\"\nSuddenly an idea struck the psychiatrist. He said, \"Okay, you come close to the mirror.\"\nAnd then he brought a needle, pushed the needle into the madman's hand -- before pushing the needle in he asked, \"Do you think dead men bleed?\"\nHe said, \"No. How can a dead man bleed?\"\nHe pushed the needle in, blood started oozing out. The psychiatrist was very happy and he said, \"Now look!\"\nDo you know what the madman said? He said, \"What is there to look at? That\nsimply proves that dead men do bleed.\"\nYou can go on supporting your illusions -- very logically. You can go on thinking you are awake and you can remain asleep. Kabir says:\n... AND WHERE YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT, AND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING\nFOR.…\nAsk these questions deep down in your own heart: What are you looking for? Where are you? Where are you asleep? In what space are you asleep?\nRothstein owed a hundred dollars to Weiner. The debt was past due and Rothstein was broke, so he borrowed the hundred dollars from Spivak and paid Weiner.\nA week later, Rothstein borrowed back the hundred dollars from Weiner and paid Spivak.\nAnother week went by and Rothstein borrowed back the hundred dollars from Spivak to pay Weiner.\nHe repeated this transaction several times, until finally he called them up and said,\n\"Fellas, this is a lotta bother. Why don't you two exchange the hundred dollars every week and keep me out of it!\"\nThis is what is happening here, everywhere in the world. You can learn how to keep yourself out of it, and that is the secret of awareness. This transaction will continue; the world will remain a marketplace -- it was so before, it will remain so afterwards too. But you can be out of this transaction -- you can be a witness to it. You can slip out of your identity. It is your identity where you are asleep. It is your ego where you are asleep.\nThe ego means simply that the self is asleep. The moment the self awakes, the ego disappears, is not found any more.\nAndrews, a white Georgia farmer, hired Monroe, a black, to chop some wood.\nMonroe took the axe and began hacking away. But in a little while the farmer noticed Monroe sitting in the shade, watching another negro do the work.\n\"Why you sittin' there doing nothing when I am paying you to cut the wood?\" asked Andrews. \"How come you got somebody else doing it?\"\n\"I hired him to do it for me,\" said Monroe.\n\"Is that a fact,\" said the white man. \"How much are you paying him?\"\n\"I am paying him a dollar and a quarter,\" answered Monroe. \"Why would you want to do that?\" snorted the white man. \"I am paying you only a dollar!\"\n\"I know,\" said the black, \"but it is worth a quarter to be boss for once.\"\nThe ego is constantly in search of being a boss -- whatsoever the cost, at any cost. You are losing your whole opportunity of life just to fulfill a shadowy, non- substantial notion\n-- the notion of ego: \"I am somebody.\" Nobody is nobody. We are all one; we are not separate.\nAt the source we are one, at the goal we will be one again. Just in this dark night when we have fallen asleep we are having private dreams. Remember, the real is universal, the unreal is private. You cannot even invite your girlfriend into your dream -- hence it is false. It is so private you cannot share it. Anything that is so private is bound to be false, and there is nothing more private than the ego -- and that is the center of all your dreaming mind, sleeping mind.\nAnd people go on wasting their whole lives, not even knowing what they are looking for.\nDo you know exactly what you are looking for? Do you have some idea? Do you have some sense of direction?\nIT IS MORNING, SWAN, SAYS Kabir, wake up, CLIMB IN THE AIR, FOLLOW ME!\nThe original has something more:\nAB HI HANSA CHET SABERA --\nNow is the morning, swan...\nNOW has to be remembered. The translation has missed something: IT IS MORNING, SWAN, WAKE UP...\nThe original says: It is ALWAYS morning -- NOW wake up, because now is the morning. The present is always light, the present is always sunrise. Being in the past or being in the future, you go on missing the light, the door from where light penetrates you.\nAB HI HANSA CHET SABERA -- This is the door, now is the time -- now or never!\nIT IS MORNING, SWAN, WAKE UP, CLIMB IN THE AIR, FOLLOW ME!\nAND ONE CAN WAKE UP ONLY IF ONE STARTS CLIMBING IN THE AIR.\nThis is a metaphor, a mystic metaphor. It means: you start moving into the world of quality, not into the world of quantity. People live in the world of quantity: more money, more power, more prestige, more respectability. These are all quantities.\nYou have so much -- you can double it, treble it, you can have it thousandfold, but it is all quantity. There is a different dimension: the dimension of quality. For example, you can have one sex experience, you can have two, you can have three, you can have four; then it is quantity. But if your sex experience starts becoming more a love experience, and your love experience starts becoming more a prayer experience, then it is quality.\nQuantity is horizontal, quality is vertical. Once you start changing qualitatively, you start soaring high, you move in the vertical world. Matter is horizontal, spirit is vertical. That is basically the meaning of the symbol of the cross. The cross is not a Christian symbol, remember; the cross is older than Christ; it is a very ancient symbol. The cross simply means that life has two dimensions: one horizontal, one vertical. If you live on the horizontal you will live asleep -- that's why when you have to go to sleep you have to be in a horizontal position; lying down in the bed, you become horizontal. When you wake up, you stand up, you\nbecome vertical.\nNow, even scientists will agree with it, that all that has happened to man, all evolution, has happened because man some day in the past decided not to walk on four but to stand on two feet. Man became vertical -- that was the moment when evolution started. Man was no more animal. Animals are horizontal: man became vertical.\nJust the physical verticality, and so much has happened to man. Think of spiritual verticality, think of the spiritual verti-cal dimension, and you cannot even imagine what is possible, you cannot even dream about it. You have no idea at all! You need not be beggars then -- the whole kingdom, the whole universe, with all its beauty and joy, is yours.\nIT IS MORNING, SWAN, WAKE UP, CLIMB IN THE AIR...! I KNOW OF A COUNTRY THAT SPIRITUAL FLATNESS DOES NOT CONTROL, NOR CONSTANT DEPRESSION, AND THOSE ALIVE ARE NOT AFRAID TO DIE.\nKabir says: I KNOW OF A COUNTRY... I know of a space -- if you come with me, if you dare to come with me, it needs daring, if you are courageous enough to soar with me, if you are ready to leave the muddy pools where you have made your abodes, to go to the Himalayas, beyond the Himalayas, to the purest lake, Mansarovar.… The word MANSAROVAR IS also beautiful -- it means the lake of consciousness.\nI KNOW OF A COUNTRY THAT SPIRITUAL FLATNESS DOES NOT CONTROL...\nHere, in the name of spirituality, something pseudo, something false is being sold. The temples and the mosques and the churches and the gurudwaras, they are selling you something which has nothing to do with spirituality. Nanak had something to give, but Nanak is no more. And Mohammed had something to give, but he is no more. Now there are only dead traditions. You will have to find an alive Master who KNOWS OF A COUNTRY WHERE SPIRITUAL FLATNESS DOES NOT CONTROL.\nIn this world. very spiritually flat people are thought to be saints. In fact, the more spiritually flat you are, the more spiritually stupid you are, the more you will be respected by the masses -- because the more you will oblige the masses by being according to their ideas of what a saint should be. Only mediocre, stupid people can follow the masses, can fulfill their expectations.\nA man who has any courage, a man who has any guts, is bound to be a rebel. He will not be worshipped as a saint in his life -- he will be worshipped as a saint only when he is gone. People worship dead saints: either you have to be dead while alive -- they will worship you -- or they will wait: when you really die and nothing of you is left, and the whole fragrance has evaporated, then they will worship you.\nJesus they crucified, and crucified Jesus they worship. Socrates they killed, poisoned, and now for centuries they have honoured him as one of the greatest human beings who has ever walked on the earth. Mansoor they murdered, butchered, and now Sufis go on claiming that he is one of the greatest Sufis. When he was being killed, even these Sufis were standing in the crowd and watching. And nobody even protested -- not even a very famous Sufi, Junaid, who was present in the crowd and who knew perfectly well that Mansoor was innocent, that Mansoor's declaration \"I am God!\" was not against God.\nMansoor's declaration that \"I am God!\" was not a sin. In fact, Mansoor was no more there\n-- God had declared himself through him. Junaid knew it, but still was afraid of the crowd, kept quiet. And when people were throwing stones and mud to humiliate and to insult the dying man, he also threw a roseflower -- for two reasons. Must have been a very diplomatic mind: so people knew that he was also throwing something, that he was not in favour of Mansoor, and Mansoor would know that he had not thrown a stone or mud -- he had thrown a roseflower. But the story is tremendously beautiful...\nWhen he was being hit by stones and his whole body was oozing blood, he was laughing, he was in a state of celebration, because he was being sacrificed in the name of God. It was a moment to celebrate! But when he was hit by the roseflower, he wept -- the story says Mansoor wept.\nSomebody standing nearby asked him, \"What is the matter with you? Stones are\nbeing thrown at you; all over the body you have been wounded, blood is flowing from everywhere, and you kept laughing and smiling. And a roseflower hit you, and you wept?\"\nMansoor said, \"Yes, because the man who has thrown the roseflower knows that I am innocent. Still he is not courageous enough to say so. The others who are throwing stones at me are ignorant -- I am praying for them, I am praying to God, 'Forgive them because they know not what they are doing.' But I cannot pray for this man who has thrown the rose, that's why I am crying and weeping. What should I do now? I cannot say to God,\n'Forgive this man because he knows not what he is doing' -- he knows perfectly well what he is doing, and he knows perfectly well that I am absolutely innocent.\"\nWhen he said these words, Junaid disappeared into the crowd, became very much afraid: people might catch hold of him.\nNow, Sufis go on claiming that Mansoor was one of the greatest enlightened people of the world, now they worship him.\nThe ways of man are very strange. This world is really very flat as far as spirituality is concerned. And the so-called spirituality is very boring too. And the so-called spirituality is more or less rubbish -- rubbish that has gathered down the ages: theories, thoughts, systems, but not a single iota of experience.\nHence Kabir says:\nI KNOW OF A COUNTRY THAT SPIRITUAL FLATNESS DOES NOT CONTROL...\nCome with me! I can take you to a space where all these fools are no more pretending to be spiritual, where all these dull, stupid fellows are no more thought to be saints.\nA priest dies. At the Pearly Gates he is given a warm welcome by Saint Peter, who presents him the keys of a small, old, rotten car and a small one-bedroom apartment.\nWhen he gets there, there is another pleasant surprise for him, for his next door\nneighbour turns out to be a parson who had been a good friend of his Down Below.\nThey decide to stroll down to the Pearly Gates to check out the action, and they are horrified when they spot a certain rabbi strolling through the Pearly Gates as though he own the place. For they knew this particular rabbi only too well, and he had been the scandal of their community. Sodomy, usury -- name any vice, he had committed it. The two reverends were even more horrified when Saint Peter bowed low to the rabbi, told him what an honour it was to have him in Heaven, and presented him with keys to a Rolls Royce, a town house and a country house.\n\"This is outrageous!\" priest and parson storm at Saint Peter. \"We lead pious, godfearing lives and all we get are small cars and small apartments. But this schmuck of a rabbi, he does everything vile, yet you give him a Rolls Royce, a town house, and a country house.\nHow come?\"\n\"Well, I am sorry, gentlemen,\" Saint Peter apologizes, \"but he is a relative of the management.\"\nKabir is not talking about a country like this. He is not talking about the heaven of your imagination. Your heaven will be an exact replica of this world; maybe a little bit decorated here and there, modified, a little better -- a better standard of living, but not real life.\nKabir is talking of an inner space:\nI KNOW OF A COUNTRY THAT SPIRITUAL FLATNESS DOES NOT CONTROL, NOR CONSTANT DEPRESSION.\nIn this world you will find two types of people: one who is just boringly religious, flat; another who is just worldly, but depressed. The pseudo religious at least hopes that something great is going to happen after death, but the worldly man does not even have that hope -- he is very depressed. You can see this...\nIn India you will feel the difference from the West. India is a flat spiritual\ncountry, but people are in a way hopeful. Life is short, and soon it will be gone, and then the paradise and all the joys; and the more you suffered in life, the more you will be rewarded. So carry on, be patient.\nIn the West, people are not flatly spiritual, and they have no hope, no future, no life after death. Then there is great depression, then they are very heavy, as if they are carrying mountains of worries, anxieties.\nBoth states are wrong. Kabir says:\n... AND THOSE ALIVE ARE NOT AFRAID TO DIE. I KNOW OF A COUNTRY...\n... where people know death is a lie, where people know that life is eternal. I know a space where you will also be able to see and feel and experience that life never begins, never ends -- that death is only a change of garments.\nTHERE WILD FLOWERS COME UP THROUGH THE LEAFY FLOOR, AND THE FRAGRANCE OF 'I AM HE' FLOATS ON THE WIND. THERE THE BEE OF THE HEART STAYS DEEP INSIDE THE,FLOWER.\nAND CARES FOR NO OTHER THING.\nHe is talking about the inner space, the inner silence, the contentless consciousness, samadhi.\nTHERE WILD FLOWERS COME UP...\nWild because they are spontaneous, wild because no gardener has tended to them, wild because they are SO full of life -- they are not civilized, cultured, pale\n-- so full of blood and so full of juice. Wild because you have not seen them yet, not even in your imagination do they cast any shadows.\nTHERE WILD FLOWERS COME UP THROUGH THE LEAFY FLOOR,\nAND THE FRAGRANCE OF 'I AM HE' FLOATS ON THE WIND.\nNOW THIS IS SOMETHING UNTRANSLATABLE. The Sanskrit word that Kabir uses is SOHAM. Literally it means 'I am he' -- 'I am that.' But that is not the point. SOHAM is not a word but a sound. If you become utterly silent, you will hear this sound arising from the deepest core of your being: SOHAM. It is not a word; it is a sound, pure sound. It is a kind of inner music which is heard when all the noise of the mind has left you. Because it is heard only when the mind has left you, when there are no longer any thoughts to disturb, no interference, the whole world forgotten, and you are in absolute aloneness, and everything has stopped, time has stopped, space has disappeared, when there is only pure consciousness vibrating -- that's what Zen people call the sound of one hand CLAPPING: SOHAM -- because this sound is heard only when you have reached the very center of your being, and because with this sound, once heard, you become absolutely certain, not convinced, not that you start believing, you become absolutely certain through knowing that 'I am he' -- hence the sound has gathered a meaning around it, but basically it is a sound.\nAnd the mystics say that the whole existence is full of this sound, SOHAM. Whenever you are silent, you will hear it. This is the voice of God, and this voice reveals to you who you are.\n... AND THE FRAGRANCE OF 'I AM HE' -- SOHAM -- FLOATS ON THE WIND.\nTHERE THE BEE OF THE HEART STAYS DEEP INSIDE THE FLOWER...\nThen who wants to go out? The sound of SOHAM showers on you as nectar. Then who wants to go out? for what? All that you have been desiring is suddenly fulfilled; all that you have asked is given. The door is open.\nTHERE THE BEE OF THE HEART STAYS DEEP INSIDE THE FLOWER, AND\nCARES FOR NO OTHER THING.\nDON'T GO OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE TO SEE FLOWERS. MY FRIEND, DON'T BOTHER WITH THAT EXCURSION.\nINSIDE YOUR BODY THERE ARE FLOWERS.\nHE IS INDICATING TOWARDS THE SEVEN CENTERS -- the seven chakras.\nThose seven chakras are called seven flowers. We become aware only of the first, and that too in a very dim and dismal way -- a sound heard from far away, or just an echo. We become aware of the first center only, the sex center, and that too only once in a while.\nAll your sexual experiences don't bring you to the awareness of the flower. Only when you have a deep orgasm, only when you have a total orgasm, when your whole body pulsates with joy, when each fiber of your body dances with joy, when each cell of your body goes mad, wild with joy -- then only do you become aware of the first flower.\nEven that is very rare; not more than one percent of people become aware of it. Ninety-nine percent know sex only as a relief; they don't know its orgasmic quality. Even if they think they are having an orgasm, it is not orgasm -- it is just genital relief.\nOrgasm has nothing to do with genitals as such. Genitals are involved in it, but orgasm is total -- from the head to the toes, it is all over you. Nothing is being held behind. A total involvement in the moment, a total merger -- then you become aware of the first flower.\nAnd there are six higher flowers, and as you move higher, deeper orgasmic experiences are waiting for you. The seventh, the last, is called SAHASRAR -- the one-thousand-petalled lotus. And when the seventh, that is in the head, opens up, you have transcended humanity, you are no more a human being. You may be in the human body, but you are a God.\nThe Western mind finds it very difficult; they cannot understand why we call Buddha a God, why we call Mahavira a God, why we call Krishna a God. They don't even call Jesus a God; they only call him 'the son of God'. Their idea of God is: one who created the world.\nBut in the East we have gone far deeper than that. Nobody has ever created the world; in the Christian sense there is no God at all. God is not a creator but the creativity, the energy that has become manifest in existence. God is in the tree, in the rock, in the river, in you, in me. But then why do we call Buddha a God if God is everywhere? Buddha has awakened to his godliness, others are fast\nasleep.\nBy calling Buddha a God we don't mean that he created the world, we don't mean that he controls the world -- we simply mean that he has attained to the seventh orgasm, that he has come to the seventh flowering, that the ultimate has opened in him, that he is no more an individual, that he has become universal.\nYour head has an opening.… Just try to understand: your sex center has an opening; that opening joins you with nature, that opening takes you downwards. Exactly like the sex center, on the opposite pole, is SAHASRAR -- that opens upwards. Just as sex takes you downwards, SAHASRAR takes you upwards.\nSex is under the law of gravitation and SAHASRAR IS beyond the law of gravitation. It functions under a totally different law -- you can call it levitation, or you can call it\n'grace'. The law that pulls you down is gravitation, and the law that pulls you up is grace.\nScience is not yet aware of the other law; that is unfor-tunate. But religion is basically the art of helping you enter into the realm of the second law, the law of grace. And once your SAHASRAR, the one-thousand-petalled lotus, has opened, you disappear as an ego: God appears in you. Your form will remain human, but in the form of the human the superhuman starts descending.\nHindus call this state AVATARA. The word AVATARA means descendence: when a person is open towards the sky, the sky descends in him, he becomes an AVATARA.\nDON'T GO OUTSIDE, says Kabir, YOUR HOUSE... has all that you are searching and seeking outside.\nDON'T GO OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE TO SEE FLOWERS. MY FRIEND, DON'T BOTHER WITH THAT EXCURSION. INSIDE YOUR BODY THERE ARE FLOWERS.\nONE FLOWER HAS A THOUSAND PETALS.\nSix are lower. Up to the sixth you remain a human being -- you become a very superior human being, but you remain a human being. Up to the sixth you remain a sage. Entering into the seventh you become a God.\nONE FLOWER HAS A THOUSAND PETALS. THAT WILL DO FOR A PLACE TO SIT.\nAnd once you have arrived at the seventh, you have come home. Now you can sit at rest, now you can relax. Now there is nowhere to go. Now all is completed, fulfilled.\nThis was the search... and you ran in all directions. In all the ten directions you were running, hither and thither for thousands of lives, and not even a glimpse was found. But once you have reached the seventh, all is fulfilled. Suddenly now you can rest. Now there is nowhere to go, no goal to attains no object for your dec;ire -- hence desirelessness happens naturally.\nSITTING THERE YOU WILL HAVE A GLIMPSE OF BEAUTY...\nAnd this is what WE call beauty in the East. Unless the seventh flower has opened in you, you know nothing of beauty. You only say that the rose is beautiful, the sky is beautiful, the river is beautiful. You are using the word 'beautiful', but you don't know exactly what beauty is.\nIf somebody persists, insists, \"Define what beauty is,\" you will be at a loss. You will not be able to define it -- in fact, you have not known, you have simply heard. Others say the rose is beautiful, so you say the rose is beautiful. You are simply repeating others'\nopinions.\nJust fifty years ago, nobody had heard that the cactus is beautiful -- now the cactus is on the throne, the rose is dethroned. Now to talk about the rose and its beauty seems very outdated; now people have not rose plants in their houses but cactuses. The more sophisticated a person is, the more he will appreciate the beauty of the cactus.\nThe fashion has changed. Fashions change! The rose has lost its face. After a few days, the rose will come back, because people get tired -- cactus and cactus\nand cactus -- and then one day they decide enough is enough. Again, suddenly, they have to change. Watch people's dresses: each year they go on changing, and after ten, twelve years the old dress comes back, because from where are you going to get new ideas? You can ask Padma --\njust the SAME ideas go on moving in a circle.\nYou don't know what beauty is. You use the word, certainly, but your word is empty.\nBeauty is known only by one who has known the inner beauty, one who has known the inner flower opening. Then whenever a flower is seen, it reminds you of your inner beauty.\nYes, Kabir seeing a roseflower will start dancing, will start singing, because the rose flower on the outside will simply trigger his inner experience of his own flower. Seeing the starry night, he will start singing or playing on his flute, because suddenly the starry night will remind him of his own inner sky -- which is far more beautiful.\nSITTING THERE YOU WILL HAVE A GLIMPSE OF BEAUTY INSIDE THE BODY AND OUT OF IT,\nBEFORE GARDENS AND AFTER GARDENS.\nOnce you have seen the inner beauty, then you will be able to see the outer also as beautiful. Once you have seen God within, you will be able to see him without too. The original is very beautiful:\nBAGO NA JA RE NA JA, TERI KAYA MEN GULJAR.\nDon't go to the gardens! The garden is within you.\nDon't go, don't go, don't go to the gardens.\nBAGO NA JA RE NA JA, TERI KAYA MEN GULJAR.\nWithin your own body is the garden of gardens. SAHAS-KANVAL PAR BAITH KE\nTU DEKHE RUP APAR.\nFind out where this one-thousand-petalled lotus is within you, and then sit upon it,\nand then see the beauty of the formless, then see the beauty of the invisible, then see the beauty of the intangible, then see the beauty of the unknowable.\nThose who have only known the known have known nothing. Those who have only seen the seeable have not seen anything. Unless you become capable of seeing the unseen and hearing the unheard, you have not come yet to your full potential.\nGod gives you a great gift of potential. The only way to return the gift in gratitude and thankfulness is to make the potential actual. Be what your seed is carrying within you.\nBecome it! Be it!\nThis small body is not small: it contains a universe. And this body is not just a body: it is the temple of God. Love it, respect it, explore it. And don't get stuck at the first center.\nYou have to move from sex to samadhi. Unless your sexual energies are transformed into samadhi you are not fulfilling your destiny, you are not fulfilling your nature. You are missing the great opportunity that life is.\nThe Fish in the Sea is Not Thirsty\nChapter #8\nChapter title: Time to be Getting Home 18 April 1979 am in Buddha Hall Archive\ncode:\n7904180\nShortTitle:\nFISH08\nAudio:\nYes Video: No Length:\n110\nmins\nThe first question Question 1\nOSHO, YOU SAY THAT IT IS ENOUGH FOR US TO JUST BE, THAT WE DON'T\nNEED TO DO ANYTHING TO BE IN GOD. I HAVE THIS GUT-FEELING THAT I NEED TO DO TO BE WORTHY, TO CONTRIBUTE, TO GIVE SOMETHING. AND\nYOU SAY THAT GOD IS WITHIN ME. I REALIZE I AM LOOKING INSIDE FOR\nSOME CONCEPT I GOT FROM THE OUTSIDE. IT IS LIKE LOOKING DOWN\nINTO A WELL IN THE NIGHT. I SEE REFLECTIONS AND I THINK IT IS THE\nBOTTOM, BUT IT IS ONLY THE SURFACE. EVEN WHEN I KNOW NEED ONLY\nLET AND WAIT RATHER THAN LOOK FOR ANYTHING, I AM STILL WAITING\nFOR MY OWN CONCEPTS OF WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN. PLEASE COMMENT.\nPrem Garima,\nTHE FIRST THING -- THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL -- TO BE understood is\nthat you are already in God. It is not a question of being in God: you are already there. Just as the fish is in the ocean, you are in God. God simply means the existence, that which exists.\nIn the ancient Hebrew, the word 'God' stands for that which is. 'G' stands for that, 'O' for which, and 'D' for is -- that which is. The word 'God' is tremendously significant. It does not indicate a person; it simply indicates a presence. And the presence is everywhere!\nLife is synonymous with God, universe is synonymous with God. To be is to be in God --\nthere is no other way. To breathe is to breathe in God -- there is no other way. To sleep is to sleep in God and to wake up is to wake up in God -- there is no other way. You can choose to sleep, still you are in God. You can choose to forget God, still you are in God.\nYou can choose to deny God, still you are in God. Not to be in God is the only impossible thing -- the only impossible thing I say.\nSo it is not a question of becoming worthy. But I am not saying don't become worthy. I am not saying be lazy, lousy. I am not saying become an escapist. I am\nnot saying don't contribute to existence. But your contribution to existence should not be a means to reach God -- that's what I am saying. Your contribution to existence should be in gratefulness that you are in God. It should not be a means to reach -- because you are already there. It should be an overflowing of joy because you are already there. Be very clear about the distinction.\nShare your joy, your love, your ecstasy. Make life as beautiful as possible. Just out of thankfulness that God has chosen you to be, that you are allowed to be, that you are given life. What else can you do? If you can sing a song, sing it with your totality! If you can paint, paint, and put your whole heart in it. If you can dance, dance to abandon so you disappear completely in the dance and there is no more any dancer but only the dance remains.\nBut these are not means, let me remind you, to reach God -- these are just our poor thanks, our heartfelt gratitude.\nPrayer is true when it comes out of gratitude. Prayer is false when it is just a means to persuade God, to seduce God, to ask for something from him -- even if you are asking God himself, then too your prayer is full of desire. And when prayer is full of desire, it is too heavy, it can't have wings. It can only grope in the darkness of the earth; it cannot soar high in the sunlit sky.\nWhen prayer is without desire it has wings, it can reach the ultimate. And when prayer is without weight, when it is out of thankfulness, not desiring anything but just to show your gratitude for all that God has already done for you.…\nGarima, you say: IS IT ENOUGH FOR US TO JUST BE? BUT MY GUT- FEELING IS\nTHAT I NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO BE WORTHY, TO CONTRIBUTE, TO\nGIVE...\nIt is not a gut-feeling: it is just what has been conditioned in you by the society. The society has been telling you continuously, persistently, day in, day out, from your very childhood -- in the school, in the college, in the university, in the church, the priest, the politician, the parent, the professor, they are all joined together in one single conspiracy: to give you the idea that as you are you are unworthy. You have to do something, you have to prove yourself, then only will\nyou be worthy.\nThis is the strategy of the society to exploit you; this is the society's ugly way to make slaves of you, not creators but slaves. But in beautiful, sophisticated ways you have been conditioned. Beautiful words covering very ugly realities. The ugly reality is that the society wants to use you as a slave, the society wants to manipulate you, the society wants to control you. It manages it in two ways.\nOn the outside is the state, the policeman, the magistrate; they enforce laws, but laws can never be absolute and man can always find ways to defy laws. Then the society creates another safeguard: it creates a conscience in you; it goes on hypnotizing you, saying again and again that you have to be worthy.\nAnd the helpless child has no other way than to oblige, than to surrender. His whole life is at stake; he cannot survive on his own. He has to depend on the parents. He has to watch continuously what THEY want, what THEY appreciate, what is rewarded by them.\nIf it is rewarded by them, then he is worthy, he feels good; if he is punished by them, he feels unworthy, he feels bad about himself\nSlowly slowly the idea settles, sinks deep in your heart, becomes almost your second nature, that just to be is not enough. Trees are enough, animals are enough, birds are enough -- only man has this stupid idea that just to be is not enough. It is a very cunning tactics to destroy the freedom of the individual, to destroy the self-respect of the individual, to create in the individual a deep guilt feeling. It has gone deep, certainly -- so deep, Garima, that you misunderstand it as a gut-feeling. It is not a gut-feeling at all.\nBut I am not against being creative, remember. I am all for it. I want my sannyasins to be creative -- but for a totally different reason, with a totally different intention, with a totally new motive. I want you all to be creative; I don't want you to escape to the monasteries -- I want you to live in the world and live fully, and live the whole spectrum of life. Bring your total potential to expression! Bloom in as many ways as possible!\nBecause only then will you feel fulfilled.\nBut this has not to be as a means to attain something. This has to be just an expression of your joy, of your celebration. And then the quality changes. When\nyou use something as a means, you are not really interested in it.\nFor example, if you are painting just to be appreciated, your focus is on appreciation, not on the painting; your heart is not there. You are already imagining, dreaming, how you will be appreciated. And because your constant worry is how to be appreciated, you will paint something which will not come out of you spontaneously -- you will paint something which others are bound to like. You will paint it according to them. You will become a very poor painter. You will not allow your genius to come out, because the genius is not easily appreciated, remember it. The more talented you are, the more genuine your intelligence is, the less is the possibility of being easily appreciated. The greater possibility is that you will be condemned. Why? Because a genius brings something new into the world, so new that old criterions don't fit with it. And the old criterions are deep-rooted in the human mind; they cannot easily go away.\nThe genius has to create not only his poetry, his painting, his dance, his music, he also has to create new criterions by which to judge them.\nVincent van Gogh was not appreciated in his time -- one of the greatest painters the world has ever known. He lived in utter poverty; his brother supported him. But his brother was not much in favour of his painting either, because it was not paying -- so what is the point of doing something which does not pay? On the contrary, because of his paintings people used to think that he was mad. He was painting in such a new way -- as it had never been done before. He had his own vision. He was a genius! In his paintings, trees are so high that they reach to the stars; stars are very small and trees are very big. Now who is going to appreciate this painting?\nAny schoolchild can say, \"This is nonsense! Stars are not so small, and trees -- who has seen such big trees? reaching above the stars?\" But Vincent van Gogh used to say,\n\"Whenever I see a tree, this is my feeling: that the earth is trying to reach the stars, to transcend the stars, through the trees. These are the hands of the earth reaching for the unknown, for the transcendental. And I love my earth, hence my stars are small and my trees are big. I am PART of this earth, I am also a hand of my earth. To me stars are small.\"\nThis is not a question of astronomy, physics, mathematics: it is a totally different\nvision.\nTrees are seen as ambitions of the earth, love affairs of the earth with the sky. But who is going to appreciate him?\nIn one of his paintings the sun is painted black. Now who has ever seen a black sun? But he used to say that the sun that shines outside IS black compared to the sun that is inside.\nIt is a comparison. Kabir will agree; Kabir says, \"When I saw the inner sun, then I knew that the outer sun is just a black hole. When I saw my inner life, then I knew that the outer life is nothing but another name for death.\"\nThe moment the inner is known, suddenly the outer starts fading away. Now, van Gogh is talking in d mystic way -- he is a mystic -- but who will understand? It will take years for people to understand. Van Gogh lived and died unappreciated, unknown. He remained absolutely unknown.\nYou will be surprised to know: now each of his paintings is so valuable that no other painting can compete. Even Picasso's paintings are not so valuable -- millions of dollars for a single painting. In his own day, in his whole life, he could not sell a single painting.\nHe had to distribute his paintings to friends or to the man who used to give him a cup of tea in the morning free of charge. Those same paintings now cost millions of dollars.\nPeople had discarded them; people accepted them out of politeness, because as far as they were concerned it was all junk -- so why collect it?\nVincent van Gogh committed suicide when he was only thirty-three. It was impossible to live; he could not earn a single pie. His brother used to give him enough money, just enough, to exist, to survive. But he needed money to paint -- for the canvas and the colours and the brushes. So this was his arrangement: out of seven days... he used to get money every Sunday for one week. Every week, for three days he would eat and for four days he would fast, so that money could be saved to purchase canvases, colours, and other things that he needed.\nTo me, van Gogh's fasting is far more significant than all the fasts that have been done by your so-called saints. THIS fasting has something beautiful in it,\nsomething spiritual in it.\nWhen your so-called saints go on a fast, it is a means; they are fasting so that they can reach heaven and enjoy all the heavenly joys. But van Gogh's fasting has a totally different quality to it: his love to create.\nAnd why did he commit suicide? He committed suicide... that too has a tremendous significance. It is no ordinary suicide. In fact, a man like van Gogh cannot do anything in an ordinary way. He committed suicide because he said, \"Whatsoever I wanted to paint, I have painted. Now, just to exist is pointless. I have given that which I came to give; now I can go back to the original source. There is no need to live in the body any more. I have contributed.\"\nYears and years passed, then slowly slowly he was appreciated. Now he is thought to be one of the greatest painters in the world.\nAnd this has been so with all the geniuses: in their own time they are condemned\n--\ncondemned by the masses, condemned by the crowd, condemned by the priests, condemned by the politicians. They are appreciated by only very few people -- sensitive, receptive, intelligent -- only by very few people who have the capacity to see something that is new, unknown, that has never happened before; only by very few people who can put their minds aside and look.\nI would like you to be creative, but don't be bothered about appreciation, don't be bothered that you will be gaining fame, name through it. Whenever the motive is to gain something out of creativity, you are no more interested in it. You become a technician; you are no more an artist. You may do the painting, and you may do it perfectly, technically perfectly, but it will not have the soul, it will not be alive, because you will not be there. You will be looking all around for the appreciators to come. And you will always paint accordingly, so that they can appreciate.\nThere are people who say only that which people want to hear. These people will be very famous, known, appreciated, respected, but they are mediocre people. The genius speaks that which arises in his heart; he does not care a bit whether anybody is going to like it or not. He says it straight, he says it direct -- he never thinks of the results and the consequences.\nBe creative in that sense and your creativity will become an offering to God. God has given you so many gifts, Garima; something HAS to be done just in deep thankfulness.\nBut remember: with no motive, not as a means but as an end unto itself. Art for art's sake, and creation for creation's sake, and love for love's sake, and prayer for prayer's sake.\nAnd that's how one, slowly slowly, becomes religious. The religious person lives in the moment; he has no worry about the future, not even about the next moment. When it comes, it will come. He does not prepare for it. He lives this moment, and out of this moment the next will be born. And if this moment has been beautiful, if this moment has been a benediction, the next is going to be, of course, a deeper benediction, a greater blessing.\nGarima, you say: I HAVE THIS FEELING THAT I NEED TO DO TO BE WORTHY...\nTHE NEED TO DO CAN BE A GUT-FEELING, because we have too much energy and the energy wants to dance, the energy wants to paint, the energy wants to sing, the energy wants to DO something. But this can't be a gut-feeling: I NEED TO DO TO BE\nWORTHY. That is a feeling that has been put inside you -- like scientists put electrodes in the brain and then a person can be manipulated.\nJust like that the society has been going on down the ages -- it creates a conscience in you: \"Do this, this is right, approved, respected. Don't do that; that is unworthy of you.\nYou will be condemned if you do it.\" And a kind of division is created within you between right and wrong, between the 'should' and the 'should-not'.\nAnd the problem is that no 'should' can ever be a fixed phenomenon; it changes with life.\nNo right is always right, and no wrong is always wrong, so to decide beforehand is dangerous. I don't teach you conscience; conscience means right and wrong are like things, decided: this is a rose and that is a lotus, and this is a stone and that is a diamond -\n- decided. Decided for ever! Right and wrong are not things. They change. Life is a riverlike phenomenon. What is right today may not be right tomorrow.\nOne Zen Master asked his disciple, \"What is God?\"\nThe disciple bowed down, remained silent. The Master blessed him and said, \"This is good. I am happy.\"\nNext day, again, the Master asked the disciple, \"What is God?\"\nAnd of course now he had learnt, so he bowed down, an even deeper bow, remained quiet, even closed his eyes, and the Master hit him hard on the head and said, \"You stupid!\" The disciple was puzzled. He said, \"But what has happened? Yesterday you were so happy, and the answer is the same -- even better than yesterday!\"\nAnd the Master said, \"That is where you went wrong: yesterday was yesterday, today is today. Now you are simply repeating a ready-made formula. Now you are not being true, not being spontaneous, not being responsible. Now you have learnt a trick. How can the same answer be right today? Twenty-four hours have passed, so much water has gone down the Ganges!\"\nExistence is dynamic, it is not static -- it is not a stagnant pool. It is a constant continuum, flow. No answer can ever be fixed -- and that's where the society deceives you: it gives you fixed answers. with fixed answers one thing is good -- that's why we cling to them --\nthey give you a sort of certainty, security, safety. You can remain certain that you are right.\nBut life goes on changing, And your 'right' remains fixed. And then your whole life becomes a misery, because your answers never fit the questions. Then your whole life is an effort to put square plugs into round holes -- your whole life you go on trying. And it is very frustrating. And the reason is: you never see that life is changing.\nAnd the really conscious person changes with life. The really conscious person cannot afford to be consistent. Consistency is part of a mediocre mind. I am not saying be deliberately inconsistent; I am simply stating a fact, that to be consistent means to be stupid, to be consistent means to remain with the past,\nblind to the present. If you look at the present you have to change with life.\nHence you will find a thousand and one contradictions in Jesus' statements, and so is the case with Gautam Buddha. And that has always been the case with the enlightened people, because they don't have any ready-made answer. You hanker for the ready-made answer so you can jump upon it, you can hold it tight in your hand and you can be certain.\nYou suffer from uncertainty -- and uncertainty is the nature of life. Certainty is part of death. Be certain and you will be dead. Remain flowing, remain uncertain, remain available to the changing circumstances, and you will remain more and more alive.\nTo be totally alive means to live in the moment with no past interfering at all -- then you respond to the moment and the response comes from your consciousness not from your conscience. Conscience is a deception; conscience is a social trick. The society has created the conscience. And the function of the Master is to destroy your conscience so that your consciousness can be freed.\nYour gut-feeling is not a gut-feeling. You have been deceived. There is no need to do anything to be worthy -- you are already worthy. If you were not worthy, you would not be here at all. God has given you birth, has created you -- must have seen some worth in you. If you are unworthy, then God is not a very original creator, then he is not much of a creator either. How can he create an unworthy person?\nSociety makes you unworthy, because that is the only way to exploit you -- to make you feel unworthy. Then you will try hard to become worthy because that is the only way to gain self-respect. And to become worthy you will follow the dictates of the society.\nSociety creates fear in you -- fear of being unworthy, fear of being condemned, fear of being left alone, fear of being nobody, fear of being anonymous. And then you are ready to yield, to bow down, to any kind of nonsense.\nSimon's parents were in despair when he flunked out of school. They tried sending him to every school in the city -- private, public, progressive, military academy -- but he took no interest. Finally they tried a Catholic school. When Simon came home with his first report card, his parents were surprised to see a straight A report.\n\"What happened?\" they asked him.\n\"Well,\" he replied. \"When I saw that poor guy nailed to the cross everywhere I looked, I knew they meant business!\"\nCreate fear... create as much fear as you can. That has been the policy of the society.\nHells have been created just to catch hold of you; heavens have been created just to reward those who will follow the dictates. All are imaginary: there is no hell, no heaven.\nBut these rewards and punishments are subtle strategies, and they have worked up to now, and they have destroyed all human dignity.\nThis is not a gut-feeling in you. Your gut-feeling and the conscience created by the society have got mixed up. The gut-feeling is to DO something -- yes, that is a gut-feeling. When energy is there, one wants to do something; that is natural. Energy wants to be expressed. But WITH the motive to be worthy, that is a conscience part which is getting mixed with your gut-feeling. Be clear about it!\nYou have been messed around by the society in every possible way. You have been confused so much that you have to depend on somebody. Either you go to the priest -- in the old days you used to go to the priest. In India they still go to the priest. In the West the new priest has arisen: the psychotherapist, the psychiatrist, the psychologist -- go to him.\nAnd the miracle is that the priest is just like you, maybe even more in a mess than you are, but still you go to him to find good advice. Yes, he repeats good advice like a parrot.\nYour psychotherapist, your psychiatrist, your psychoanalyst, may be in deeper anxiety, in more tensions than you are.\nJust the other night one of my sannyasins was asking me, \"Osho, you had told me last time when I came here, 'Look for the lighter side of life, count the roses, ignore the thorns. They are there, take note of them, but don't pay too much attention to them.' But my psychoanalyst has said, 'This is dangerous, this is going to repress your emotions.' So I am puzzled -- what to do?\"\nI told him, \"You just wait a few days, your psychoanalyst will be here...!\" But I was not aware that this sannyasin himself is a psychoanalyst. Just later on Vivek told me that he himself is a psychoanalyst. Now, one psychoanalyst going to another psychoanalyst -- for what? And that one may be going to somebody else.\nTHE FOUNDER OF PSYCHOANALYSIS, Sigmund Freud, was one of the most pathological persons you can imagine -- very superstitious. You will laugh if you go into his biography about how such a man could become the founder of psychoanalysis, and how such a man could be trusted, that what he was saying was true.\nOne of his friends gave him the idea that just as each woman has a twenty-eight- day period when her menstruation comes, exactly like that each man has a twenty-three-day period. There is some truth in it -- not twenty-three days, exactly twenty-eight days. Now much more research has been done on it.\nThose four, five days when a woman goes through the period are sad, depressive, dull, negative -- exactly like that man also goes into a negative state each month for four, five days. Of course, his period is not very visible, but it is there; it is a psychological fact. It should be there, because men and women are not very different.\nSo the friend's idea was on the right track. Sigmund Freud suddenly got one idea\n-- lying down in his bed, he was thinking about twenty-eight and twenty-three -- suddenly an idea flashed in his mind: twenty-eight plus twenty-three means fifty-one, and he could not sleep the whole night. He became certain by the morning that he was going to live fifty-one years -- a very great gut-feeling. And he started talking about it twenty-eight plus twenty-three -- fifty-one years and he will die.\nAnd the fifty-first year came and passed... and he did not die. Then something else had to be found. The day he was expecting to die, his phone number was changed and the end of the phone number was sixty-two. So he said, \"Look, another indication: so now I am going to die at sixty-two.\" But that day also came and was passing.\nBut the people like Sigmund Freud are not easy... they will find something or other. He was staying in a hotel and the number of the room was eighty-two, so he said, \"Look, another indication from above -- at eighty-two I am going to die\n-- that is absolutely certain.\"\nAnd that day also passed. He died when he was eighty-three.\nSuch superstitious people... he was so afraid of death, that's why he was so much concerned about it. He was so afraid of death that five times in his life he fainted publicly because somebody started talking about death. He used to faint flat on the ground. Just the IDEA of death! And such a pathological, neurotic person became the founder of psychoanalysis.\nAnd he used to project himself: whatsoever was true for him he thought was true for every human being. That is the very limit of nonsense. All that he has said about man is not about man -- it is about Sigmund Freud. And Sigmund Freud is a single individual; he does not represent man. Nobody represents man! Nobody can ever represent man.\nSo maybe a few people are helped by psychoanalysis, very few people -- rarely have I seen a person who has been helped by psychoanalysis -- but those are the people who are of the same type as Sigmund Freud.\nAnd now much research has happened and it has been found that even those people who are helped are not helped by psychoanalysis but by something else. In one experiment, twenty-five persons were given psychoanalysis for six months, and twenty-five persons were just kept waiting and were told, \"Soon your psychoanalysis will start.\" They were all suffering from the same kind of illness, and the result was very surprising.\nThe twenty-five who were given psychoanalysis were helped a little bit, but the twenty-five who were kept waiting were helped far more. Just waiting helped them far more. In fact, this secret has been known in the East, it has been practised for centuries. If you take a mental case into a Zen monastery, they put him in isolation for three weeks; nobody talks to him -- just the opposite of psychoanalysis -- nobody talks to him, nobody listens to him. They just keep him isolated; somebody goes, absolutely silently, and puts the food there, comes back. He has to live with himself for three weeks... and miracles have been happening down the ages.\nJust putting him there for three weeks in isolation, slowly slowly he cools down\n-- no psychoanalysis, no therapy, just isolation. In fact, he was suffering too much from people\n-- the stress of being in a crowd continuously.\nPsychoanalysis may not be the real cause of help, but the length of time -- two years, three years, four years, the psychoanalysis continues. It continues as long as you can afford it; it depends on you. If you have enough money, it can continue your whole life.\nIn fact, psychoanalysis never comes to a termination. It cannot come, because the mind is very inventive. It goes on inventing more and more rubbish. It starts enjoying, slowly slowly, because the more rubbish it brings up, the more happy the psychotherapist feels.\nSeeing him happy, it obliges more.\nWhatsoever the expectations of the psychotherapist are, the patient fulfills them. Patients are really patient people, very obliging, courteous. Good people they are! That's why they are suffering; they are not hard people -- not hardware but software. Because they are soft they are suffering. The hard guys are not suffering; the hard guys make others suffer. The soft guys become victims. Three, four years Lying down on the couch, talking nonsense, waiting, waiting, waiting -- it helps one to unwind, one becomes a little more relaxed.\nAnd somebody is listening to you very attentively, at least pretending that he is listening very attentively.\nMy own observation is that the attention of the psychotherapist is of immense value. This is a world where nobody gives you any attention. If the husband wants to talk to the wife she says, \"There is so much work to be done in the kitchen -- and the dishes have to be washed and I have no time.\" If the wife wants to talk to the husband, he is tired from the whole day at the office and the work and the traffic, and he wants to watch the TV.\nA survey says that the average husband/wife communication in America is only thirty-three minutes per day -- and that is the average. And in that thirty-three minutes you can count fighting, nagging, pillow-throwing, and every kind of thing. Thirty-three minutes only between husband and wife -- out of twenty-four hours?\nA great need has arisen that somebody should listen to you. Hence the psychotherapist helps -- he is a professional listener. That is the only quality that\nhe has, the only qualification really. You can start the business -- no other qualification is needed -- if you know only one thing: how to be attentively sitting there by the side and listening. Just listening attentively will help. The person starts feeling, \"I have some worth.\nSomebody...\" And the more he has paid, the more it helps because the person who is listening is no ordinary psychotherapist, not run-of-the-mill.\"... Somebody special, very famous, world-known -- and listening so attentively to me?\" The very idea gives worth,\n\"Then I must be saying something immensely beautiful.\"\nGibberish he may be bringing up. That's what in psycho-babble is called 'free association'\n-- anything that comes to your mind, bring it up. If such gibberish is being listened to so attentively, a great need is fulfilled -- he feels worthy, he feels important, he feels somebody.\nRemember, this society has messed you up so much that man as such is almost on the verge of going insane. All love has disappeared, all communication has disappeared, all friendship has disappeared, all aesthetic sensitivity has disappeared. People have become like zombies. They talk to each other yet they don't talk, they don't meet.\nThis society is an ill society, and when I say 'this society' I mean all the societies that exist in the world, more or less, in this way or that, they are ill -- because in the past, for centuries, we have been creating a model of man which is wrong. We are giving people ideals and saying \"Unless you fulfill THESE ideals you will never be worthy.\" And those ideals are impossible. We are giving people ideas of being perfect. and once the idea of being perfect enters in one's being, it turns one into a neurotic.\nAccept your limitations, accept your imperfections. That's what it means to be a human being! And accept yourself as you are -- with joy, not in helplessness.\nBecause GOD\naccepts you -- this is my basic teaching -- God accepts you, accept yourself; love yourself. Let there be a great upsurge of self-love. And out of that love you will start becoming creative; a person who loves himself is bound to become\ncreative. I am not saying he will become famous; I am not saying that he will be a Picasso or an Ezra Pound or a Pablo Neruda, no -- he may be, he may not be. But that is irrelevant! The real thing is to enjoy creativity. Whatsoever you do, do it with joy, bring your total intelligence to it, be meditative in it.\nGarima, you say: AND YOU SAY THAT GOD IS WITHIN ME. I REALIZE I AM\nLOOKING INSIDE FOR SOME CONCEPT I GOT FROM THE OUTSIDE. THAT KIND OF GOD YOU WILL NEVER FIND WITHIN YOU. You will\nhave to drop all the concepts that have been given to you from the outside,\nbecause God is not a person. No picture of God exists, no statue is possible. God is an experience! If you have the idea of a God which your parents and your society have given to you, you will go inside with that idea and that idea will be the hindrance -- it will not allow you to see that which is. And God IS that which is. It needs no concepts to see; concepts blind you. Drop all concepts.\nIf you really want to go in, go as an agnostic. This word is beautiful. You must have heard the word 'gnostic'; 'gnostic' means one who knows -- gnosis means knowledge.\n'Agnostic' means one who knows not; 'agnostic' means one who knows only one thing, that he knows not. Be an agnostic -- that is the beginning of real religion.\nDon't believe, don't disbelieve. Don't be a Hindu, and don't be a Jaina and don't be a Christian, otherwise you will go on groping in darkness for ever and for ever. Unless you drop all ideologies, all philosophies, all religions, all systems of thought, and go inside empty, with nothing in your hand, with no idea How\ncan you have an idea of God?\nYou have not known him. Just go with a great desire to know, but with no idea\nof knowledge with intensity to know, with a passionate love to know what is there, but don't carry any ideas given to you by others. Drop them outside. That is the greatest barrier for the seeker on the path of truth.\nGod is there but you cannot see because your eyes are blinded by the concepts given to you. God is not a Jew, so if you have a Jewish idea of God you will not find him. I have heard a beautiful story about a Sufi mystic, Farid:\nOne night he dreams that by the grace of Allah, he has reached Paradise. And the whole of Paradise is decorated, millions of lights.and flowers everywhere -- some celebration is going on -- and great music. He enquires, \"What is going on?\"\nAnd they say, \"This is God's birthday -- we are celebrating it. You have come at the right time.\"\nSo he stands underneath a tree to see what is happening, because a great procession starts moving on the road. A man is sitting on a horse; he enquires, \"Who is this man?\" and they say, \"Don't you know him? He is Hajrat Mohammed.\"\nAnd then millions and millions of people behind him, and he asks, \"Who are these people?\" and he is replied to. \"They are Mohammedans, followers of Mohammed.\"\nAnd then comes Jesus, and millions are following him. And then comes Krishna on his golden chariot, and millions again are following him. And so on and so forth... the procession continues, continues, continues.\nAnd then finally, in the end, on an old donkey an old man is coming. And nobody is behind him; he is just alone. Farid starts laughing looking at this man -\n- it is hilarious: nobody following him. And why should he be going on his donkey? He asks, \"Who are you, sir? I have seen Mohammed, Christ, Krishna, Mahavira, Buddha -- who are you?\nYou look like a kind of joke! And nobody following you.\"\nAnd the old man is very sad and he says, \"Yes, I am God. This is my birthday. But some people have become Mohammedans, some have become Christians, some have become Jews, some have become Hindus -- nobody is left to be with me.\"\nJust out of shock, Farid woke up. He told his disciples the next day, \"Now I am no more a Mohammedan. The dream has been a great revelation. Now I am no more part of any organized religion -- I am simply myself. I would like to be with God, at least one person following him.\"\nIf you have a certain idea of God, you will not be able to see him. Your very idea\nwill become a barrier. Drop all ideas that you have gathered from without; only then can you go within.\nYou say: IT IS LIKE LOOKING DOWN INTO A WELL IN THE NIGHT. I SEE\nREFLECTIONS AND I THINK IT IS THE BOTTOM, BUT IT IS ONLY THE SURFACE. EVEN WHEN I KNOW I NEED ONLY LET AND WAIT RATHER THAN LOOK FOR ANYTHING...\nTRUE, GARIMA, STICK WITH THAT INSIGHT. If you are looking for something you will not be able to see, because the very idea of looking for something means that you have an idea of what you are looking for. To look for something is a kind of blindness.\nSeeing happens only when you are not looking for anything in particular; you are just there, open, available. So whatsoever is is revealed. Don't look for God if you want to see him. Just wait -- let and wait. God is a happening! If you are silent, open, loving towards your own being, conscious, it is going to happen. Any moment, when you are in the right tuning with existence, it will happen.\nGod is there: you are there: just right tuning. And that's what I am teaching to you: right tuning. Dropping all ideologies helps you to be rightly tuned. And once you are in tune with existence, that is bliss. You have come home.…\nSecond question:\nQuestion 2\nOSHO, IS IT TIME THAT I SHOULD BECOME A SANNYASIN?\nIT IS ALREADY LATE! Naresh, you have already waited too long. I have known you for years, you have known me for years. For what are you waiting? The meeting should happen now. Still you are asking:\nIS IT TIME THAT I SHOULD BECOME A SANNYASIN?\nAre you dead? If you have any life in you, then this is the time. NOW is the\ntime!\nRemember Kabir -- just the other day Kabir was saying: Now, wake up -- wake up in the now, wake up here! Don't postpone.\nBranigan was driving down the road. By the way the car weaved in and out of traffic, you could tell that Branigan was pickled to the gills.\n\"Where do you think you are going?\" asked the motorcycle cop who finally stopped him.\n\"I am coming home -- hic -- from a New Year's Eve party!\"\n\"Are you kidding?\" asked the cop. \"New Year's was three weeks ago!\"\n\"I know,\" said Branigan. \"That's why I figured I better be getting home now.\"\nIs it not time, Naresh, to be getting home now? You have waited already too long, too many lives. Sannyas is nothing but a passionate jump into the enquiry for the truth, a passionate search from where we come and to where we are going and who we are. That's what sannyas is all about.\nBut you seem to be almost in a kind of sleep, and that's how everybody else is. The worldly dreams still seem to be important to you, hence the question. The world still seems to intoxicate you; money, power, prestige, are still haunting you. And you cannot be a sannyasin unless you are utterly frustrated with the world. And remember, I am not teaching escapism from the world: I teach transcendence, not escape. Be in the world, but don't be of it.\nA sannyasin is a person who lives in the world but lives meditatively, and meditation creates a distance. Then you can go on doing all kinds of things but you don't become intoxicated, you don't become identified with them. To live in awareness, without any intoxication with money, power, prestige, is the way of the sannyasin.\nHallihan and Flannigan were having a few at a new tavern in town. After an hour of heavy imbibing, Hallihan asked the bartender for the washroom.\n\"Go to the door, left of the elevator,\" said the barkeeper, \"then walk down two steps and there you are.\"\nHallihan forgot to turn left. He opened the elevator door, took ONE step and fell down the shaft.\nTen minutes later, Flannigan followed Hallihan and saw him lying at the bottom of the shaft.\n\"Look out for the SECOND step,\" shouted up Hallihan. \"It's a son of a bitch!\"\nAnd you have taken many second steps, many many times. You have fallen many many times. Are you not yet frustrated, Naresh? Are you not yet finished with the world? Are you still carrying some hope deep down in your heart? Are you still expecting that the world is going to deliver something to you? It has never happened -- to no one has it happened. And it is not going to happen to you.\nThe world only promises, it never delivers the goods. That's its illusoriness; that's why in the East we call it maya. 'Maya' does not mean that it is not there -- it is very much there, but it only promises. It never gives anything.\nI have heard a story:\nA man worshipped for many many years -- he must have tortured God as much as possible. Morning, afternoon, evening, he was praying and praying and crying and weeping. And, finally, God has to appear, and he said, \"What do you want? Be finished!\nJust take it and forgive me and forget all about me.\nAnd the man said, \"I want something, a power, so that whatsoever I need is immediately fulfilled.\"\nSo God gave him a box, a golden box -- exactly like the magic box that I give to you --\nand told him, \"Whenever you are in need you can ask. Whatsoever you ask, the box will immediately give it to you.\"\nThe man forgot all about God, he even forgot to thank him. God waited a little... but the man was no more interested in him. He was looking at the box and he started asking,\n\"Give me ten thousand rupees!\" Suddenly ten thousand rupees appeared, and he was very happy.\nAnd it continued: whatsoever he wanted used to come out of the box. Then one day, one SADHU -- one wandering monk -- stayed with the man. The sadhu, the wandering monk, also had a box -- bigger than the man's -- exactly the same shape. The man became interested. He said, \"What is this?\"\nThe sadhu said, \"This is a magic box. You ask anything. it gives you double.\"\n\"Double!\" The man asked, \"If I ask ten thousand rupees, He said, \"It gives twenty thousand.\"\nHe fell at the feet of the monk and said, \"You are a monk, you have renounced the world\n-- can't you exchange? I have a small box: it gives only whatsoever you ask.\"\nSo they changed the boxes. It was late at night, so the man thought, \"In the morning I will try out this new box.\" And in the morning he tried; he asked for ten thousand rupees...\nand the box said, \"Why not twenty thousand?\" And the man said, \"Okay, twenty thousand.\" And the box said, \"Why not forty thousand?\" And the man said, \"Okay, forty thousand.\" And the box said, \"Why not eighty thousand?\"\nThen he became afraid, because nothing was coming out! He rushed to see the monk, but he had left; he had disappeared in the night.\nIn the East, we have called the world 'maya', illusory -- it is like that box of the monk.\nYou ask anything and it says, \"Okay, you can have double.\" But it never delivers any goods; it only promises. The world is almost like the politicians -- they promise but they never fulfill\nNaresh, are you not yet finished? Have you not seen it happening many times? Each time you are living an illusion, hoping, dreaming, sooner or later disillusion comes in, frustration comes in. But rather than seeing the reality of this world, you immediately jump on another illusion -- you immediately start\ndreaming again.\nSannyas is seeing the reality of the world, that it never fulfills, that it cannot fulfill, that it is beyond its capacity to fulfill... one turns in. One has been a beggar begging from this door and that door; when one turns in, begging disappears -- one becomes an emperor.\nThen all is yours.\nAnd you need not even ask for it -- it is simply yours. This whole existence is yours, its whole beauty, its whole splendour, its starry nights, its sunsets and sunrises, its flowers and birds -- all is yours. Not in the sense that you possess it, but in the sense that you can enjoy it.\nA sannyasin learns how to enjoy, and the worldly mall learns only how to possess.\nRemember these two things; they are basic. The worldly man only thinks of how to possess more -- he never enjoys because he is concerned with pos-sessing more and more and more. The sannyasin enjoys, whatsoever he has he enjoys -- and he enjoys the whole existence -- which need not be possessed.\nDo you think first you have to possess the starry night, then you will enjoy it? Do you think first you have to possess all the birds, then you will enjoy their songs? This existence need not be possessed! And you can still enjoy. It is YOURS if you want to enjoy -- it is not yours if you want to possess. To possess it is aggressive; it is aggression on God. To enjoy it is prayerful.\nThe last question:\nQuestion 3\nOSHO, WILL YOU RECOGNIZE ME AT THE FINAL JUDGEMENT DAY?\nSuresh,\nIT ALL DEPENDS ON YOU: remember to be in orange and with the mala, because it is going to be difficult to recognize you. Just think of all the men and all the women that have existed... they will all be there. There is going to be much difficulty in recognizing people, so just you remember that thing.\nA timid, conservative, unmarried shopkeeper suddenly came into a small fortune.\nOvernight, this mild-mannered, mincing little man had all the money he could possibly use.\nBravely he snapped his fingers, clicked his heels, and decided to become a swinger. He bought expensive, mod clothes, had his hair styled, rented a lavish beach villa in Florida, and got a dark, virile tan.\nDriving home from the Rolls Royce dealer in his new car, wearing his flashiest sports clothes and swingiest sunglasses, he was suddenly struck dead by a lightning bolt. Right there in the Florida sun -- a fatal lightning bolt.\nUp at the Pearly Gates, the shopkeeper angrily faced Saint Peter. \"Why would you pick on me like that? I have been a good man all my life. The Lord has always watched over me.\"\n\"He was trying to watch over you,\" explained Saint Peter. \"He just didn't recognize you.\"\nSo, Suresh, please remember it, don't forget: be in orange and with the mala so that I can recognize you.\nBut why are you worried about the Last Judgement Day? I teach you about the immediate and you ask about the Last Judgement Day! I teach you the immediate is the ultimate and you ask about the Last Judgement Day. In reality there can be no day which can be the last. The world never begins, never ends -- it is a continuum.\nSecondly, the very word 'judgement' is ugly. God is not a judge, God is a lover -- and the lover cannot be a judge. Jesus said to his disciples: Judge ye not! Why? Because the moment you judge you start destroying the other. Who are you to judge? The moment you judge you start comparing, and who are you to compare?\nEach individual is unique, and each individual brings variety to existence. The world will not be better if there are only saints and saints and saints. It will be one of the most boring worlds if there are only saints and saints and saints. The sinners also contribute something: they make it a little salty, they bring a little\ntaste to life.\nGod is not a Judge, god is a lover, and how can love judge? Be assured that in the eyes of God there is no sinner, no saint -- in the eyes of God all are alike. And when his sun rises, it rises for the sinners too, as much as for the saints. And when his roses bloom, they give fragrance to the saints as much as to the sinners. No distinction is ever made. Just simple observation will show to you that existence makes no distinctions. All right and wrong, all good and bad, are human creations, are man-made concepts and ideas.\nAnd each society has created its own ideas of good and bad, and they go on changing.\nThey are utilitarian, remember. One thing can be a sin in one society and may not be a sin in another society. The same thing can be a great virtue in One society, and may be thought just the opposite in another society.\nIf a person beats his own body so that blood oozes out, what will you call him? Will you call him a saint or a sinner? It depends... because there has been a Christian sect that believes in beating your body so that blood comes out, and the more blood you can bring out of your body, the greater a saint you are.\nIn Russia, before Communism, there was a sect, a great sect of Christians, who used to cut their genital organs. Women used to cut their breasts -- and they were thought to be great saints. What do you think about them? You will think them pathological, mentally ill, deranged.\nThere are ideas and ideas, but all ideas are human. Don't be worried. There are people who are worried about small things -- they have been MADE to worry. Somebody smokes and he is afraid that he is going to be thrown into hell. If you have smoked tao much, one thing is certain, that you will not be sent to hell because there is too much smoke there, and you have already done it to yourself.\nSmoking may be bad for your health but is not a sin; you cannot be thrown into hell for smoking. But there are people who think even drinking tea... in Mahatma Gandhi's ashram drinking tea was a sin. If you were caught drinking tea, there was a great fuss about it. Mahatma Gandhi might have gone for a three-day fast to purify his soul and his disciples' souls because people are drinking tea.\nAnd Buddhist monks down the ages have been drinking tea. Tea is part of their\nmeditation -- and there seems to be something in it, because tea has some chemicals which can keep you awake more easily. It can be a help in meditation. If you are trying to be alert, tea can be a help.\nIn fact, tea was discovered by Buddhist monks; it is their discovery, because it was discovered in a monastery in China called Ta, that's why it is called tea. That 'ta' can be pronounced also as 'cha'; that's why in Marathi it is called 'cha' and in Hindi it is called\n'chai'. But it is from the monastery of Ta.\nAnd the man who is reputed to have grown the first tea plants was nobody else but Bodhidharma, the great Bodhidharma. The story is beautiful: He was meditating, and such a meditator happens only once in a while. For nine years he sat facing the wall -- just the wall and for nine years looking at the wall and doing nothing else. And sometimes he used to fall asleep -- naturally, if you look at the wall that long, what else is there to do? And he did not want to go to sleep.\nSo he tore out his eyelids and his eyelashes and threw them so that now there was no way to close his eyes. And the story is that out of those eyelids, those pieces of skin, and the eye-lashes, the first teaplant grew.\nThis is a beautiful story: it simply says one thing, that tea can keep you awake. It will not allow you and your eyes to close.\nBuddhists drink tea with religious ritual. In Japan, they have tea ceremonies. Tea is not an ordinary thing for them, because it keeps you awake, it gives you energy to remain more alert. They have made a very prayerful, graceful ritual out of it: the tea ceremony.\nIn each Zen monastery there is a separate tea temple, the most beautiful place -- maybe surrounded by a lake, rocks, sand, trees. And when you go into the temple, you have to go in a certain manner, in a certain posture you have to sit there, and it takes hours.\nThe tea will be prepared, the samovar will start humming, and all will be sitting in silence listening to the humming of the samovar. And slowly the flavour of the tea will reach your nostrils, and you have to drink that too. And then the tea is served -- with great grace, with great beauty, art. And the tea is served in beautiful cups, hand-made with great love and care. And then everybody starts\nsipping the tea. And it is done very prayerfully and everybody remains silent, no gossiping, no chattering -- as if there is nobody. Then they bow down to each other with great respect, and disperse without saying a word.\nIn one country, tea is so religious, so spiritual, and in Mahatma Gandhi's ashram it was a sin. It depends. These are all human ideas. You should not be worried about these things.\nMy message is simple: live alert, and live spontaneously, and live totally -- and forget all about the Last Judgement Day. I recognize you today, and that's enough. Today is enough unto itself.\nThe Fish in the Sea is Not Thirsty Chapter #9\nChapter title: In Search of the Miraculous 19 April 1979 am in Buddha Hall Archive\ncode: 7904190\nShortTitle: FISH09\nAudio: Yes Video: No Length: 99\nmins\nThe first question Question 1\nOSHO, I AM A SCIENTIST WORKING ON THE QUESTION OF HOW LIFE\nORIGINATED FROM NON-LIVING MATTER. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS\nSTUDY OF HOW NON-LIFE IS TRANSFORMED INTO LIVING MATTER IS\nVITAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIP OF SCIENCE TO RELIGION.\nTHE REASON IS THAT THE STUDY IS A CLUE TO HOW OUR EMOTIONS AND\nSPIRITUALITY DEVELOPED IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHAT DO YOU THINK?\nAdolph Smith,\nRELIGION AND SCIENCE ARE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE, and because\nthey are diametrically opposite they are complementaries. Religion cannot support science, science cannot support religion. They are bound to oppose each other -- in their very opposition is their complementariness. Hence, anything that science is going to discover is of no value to religion. In fact, EACH scientific discovery makes the existence of religion more and more difficult.\nScience tries to demystify existence, hence the question 'how?' -- how did life arise out of matter? Religion is basically a different approach: it does not want to demystify existence; its whole approach is to reveal the mystery of it. It is not a search for the answer: it is diving deep in the question itself k does not ask any questions; it takes life for granted. The question is not how life arose: the question is how life should be lived, the question is how life should be celebrated.\nThe scientific question will be: What is love? How docs love arise? What is the causality? And the religious question will be: How to drown yourself in love?\nHow to be in love? How to be love itself?\nScience will come to certain clues; those clues look stupid in the eyes of a mystic. If you ask about love, science will answer with something which is nothing but chemistry: hormones, chemicals. And the grandeur and the splendour of love are reduced -- reduced to a very mundane world. What does love have to do with chemistry? Love certainly has something to do with alchemy, but nothing to do with chemistry. It is a transforming force, but it cannot be reduced to hormones.\nLife cannot be reduced to any answer. Once life is reduced to a certain answer life becomes meaningless, it is no more worth living. It is like coming across a lotus flower.\nThe poet will enjoy the beauty of it; he will not be bothered where it comes from. He will simply enjoy the fragrance, the colour, the sun shining over it, the dewdrops on the lotus petals. And the mystic will dance around it, because he is not seeing only the lotus flower but he is seeing something of the transcendental in it. Hidden behind the lotus, its beauty, its splendour, its majesty, its magic, are the hands of God. The mystic not only feels the roseflower or the lotus flower, he also feels the mysterious presence of the unknown force called God surrounding it, protecting it, caring for it, caressing it.\nThe poet simply sees the lotus flower, the mystic goes beyond, he goes higher -- he takes the roseflower or the lotus flower to the ultimate peak. And the scientist? -- he will think about where it comes from. It comes from the mud. The scientist will start moving deeper and deeper into the mud; he will start enquiring about the mud and the elements that are in the mud.\nJust look at these three approaches: the scientist goes lower than the lotus, the mystic goes higher than the lotus, the poet remains with the lotus. In the ultimate analysis the scientist will think that the lotus is nothing but mud -- a form of mud\n-- and the mystic will think the lotus is nothing but a manifestation of God. And for the poet, a lotus is simply a lotus. Now, how can these three approaches meet?\nThe mystic cannot agree with the scientist -- in fact, the mystic will think that the scientist is destroying something tremendously important. By all his logical answers, objective answers, he is destroying the subjectivity of the lotus. The\nmystic may agree a little bit with the poet, but only a little bit, not the whole way. He will nod to the poet: he will say, \"You are on the right track, you have taken the first step. but don't get stuck there -- go on. The lotus is not enough: you have to find the face of God in the lotus. And if you cannot find the face of God in the lotus, where else are you going to find it?\"\nAdolph Smith, your question is important -- but don't remain in this confusion that if you can find some clue as to now matter becomes life you will be bringing some understanding between religion and science... you will be talking about mud! And the poet will not be convinced by you, because he knows the lotus. And what to say about the mystic? He will simply feel pity for you.\nEverything can either be reduced to its beginnings -- that's what science goes on doing --\nor it can be raised to the ultimate peak; that's what the work of religion is. And poetry is just the bridge between the two. The poetic approach is in a way closer to both science and religion. If you really want to understand religion, you have taken a wrong route.\nReligion does not think that life needs any answers. Life needs to be lived in its totality, life needs to be celebrated. Life needs to be penetrated -- that is the only way to know it.\nNot in the lab, not going deep into life cells, not by analysing the elements; those are constituents of life, but life is more than the sum total of its parts.\nSomebody is playing on a guitar, beautiful music. The scientist will become interested in the guitar, not in the music. He will think, \"From where is it coming?\" He may become interested in the fingers of the musician and in the instrument. He will analyse the instrument and he will find some wood some strings, this and that -- but that is NOT\nmusic! And if he analyses the fingers of the musician he will find some blood, some bones, skin -- and that is not music! Music is something more. The hands of the musician and the guitar are simply an opportunity for the beyond to descend to the earth.\nThe poet will listen to the music; he will not be worried about the musician and the musical instrument. He will be drunk with the music. But the mystic will\ndance with abandon, because in music he will hear the ultimate music. The poet will forget about the musician and the instrument, and the mystic will even forget about the music, because it reminds him of something deep in his own being. It reminds him of what Kabir calls the music of SOHAM -- I am that. He will forget all that is happening outside; it has triggered a process in his being. He is transported into another world.\nADOLPH SMITH, if you really have any interest in religion then you will have to meditate -- analysis won't help, scientific investigation won't help. And remember, I am not against scientific investigation -- if you are interested in it, DO it! But know perfectly well: it is not going to bridge science and religion -- they cannot be bridged. There is no need to bridge them either. They have different functions to fulfill; there is no need to create a synthesis between them -\n- because the synthesis will impoverish both, it will not enrich.\nExistence remains alive through the tension of the polar opposites: the negative and the positive, man and woman, birth and death, darkness and light, love and hate -- religion and science. These are the polar opposites. Life needs them. Without them life will become a stagnant pool, it will not be a dialectical process any more. Life is dialectics; it moves through the thesis and the antithesis, and again the synthesis becomes a thesis and creates antithesis. That's how life goes on progressing.\nReligion and science don't need to be synthesized -- they need to be purified. Science should be pure science, utterly scientific; and religion should be pure religion, utterly mystic.\nI would like you to be reminded of a great statement of a Christian mystic, Tertullian.\nSomebody asked him, \"Why do you believe in God?\" And he said, CREDO QUIA ABSURDUM -- I believe in God because he is absurd.\"\nNow, what kind of answer is this? But this is the answer of a mystic, not the answer of a scientist. The scientist will try to prove, will answer WHY he believes; he will argue. But Tertullian simply says, \"Because God is absurd, hence I believe. I believe in the mysterious, in the miraculous, in the unanswerable, in the unknowable.\"\nIf you have any interest in religion... and you can be both! I am not saying that a\nman who is a scientist cannot be religious -- a man who is a scientist can be religious -- but then he will have to create a dialectics in his own being. He will have to be very conscious. When he is working in the lab he has to forget all about religion; religion should not interfere in his scientific work. And when he leaves the lab and sits in his meditation chamber he should forget all about analysis, experimentation, observation --\nthere he should be a lover, in prayer, in meditation.\nA scientist can be both. And my approach is this, that I would like many many people to be both scientists and religious. And if some person can be all three, that is my vision of a real, true sannyasin: a scientist, a poet, a mystic. In him humanity will have blossomed to its ultimate possibilities. The potential in him will have been transformed into actuality.\nHe will have bloomed in all possible ways. He will be a multi-dimensional man.\nAnd to be a scientist does not mean that you have to be a physicist or a chemist or this and that -- to be a scientist means having a scientific approach. There are problems which can be tackled only by science. When somebody comes with an illness to me, I tell him to go to Navanit, to Darshan, to Amrit, to Hamid -- go to the doctors! Your illness needs a scientific approach.\nIn India it happens that ill people go to the saints for their blessings, and the East has remained ill, poor, because of this nonsense. If you are poor, don't go to the saints; go to the technologists, go to the scientists, go to the economists, enquire \"Why are we poor?\"\nBut you go to the saints and enquire \"Why are we poor?\" You are foolish and so are your saints. And they answer you, why you are poor; they tell you, they have to, because when you question them they cannot show their ignorance. They tell you because in your past lives you have been committing so many sins, that's why you are suffering. You ask a foolish question and you will get a foolish answer.\nGo to the scientist when it is a question about the material world. And if you have fallen in love, then don't go to a scientist -- avoid him! Even if he meets you on the way, escape, because he will destroy your whole love. He will say, \"It is all nonsense. It is just the attraction between female and male hormones -- don't be befooled. Those hormones are deceiving you.\" Don't go to the scientist;\nif you want to kiss your woman, don't go to the scientist. He will say, \"This is dangerous. All kinds of infections are possible. And millions of germs are transferred in a single kiss.\" He will make you so afraid that even if you kiss, you will not be totally there in it. And you will start carrying Dettol and things like that with you -- so kiss and then immediately wash, or before you kiss, wash.\nDon't go to the scientist when you are in love -- go to the poet. He knows about love.\nAnd when you want to know the ultimate mystery, the poet cannot be of much help either; he remains on the surface. When you want to know the ultimate mystery, go to a mystic, become a disciple to a Master, because those secrets can only be imbibed in deep trust, surrender, love.\nThe second question Question 2\nOSHO TODAY YOU SAID TO BE CONSTANT IS TO BE STUPID. THE TRUTH\nCANNOT CHANGE IT REMAINS FOR EVER CONSTANT. NOW WHAT?\nI HAVE NOT SAID that to be constant is to be stupid -- I had certainly said to be consistent is the way of the mediocre mind, the stupid mind. But don't you see the difference between being constant and being consistent?\nConsistency is a logical phenomenon. When I say: Don't be consistent, I mean you need not remain confined to your past -- that's what consistency is. You have done something today; tomorrow life will change, and you have to repeat the same thing to be consistent.\nTomorrow will not be today; today is not your yesterday. The answers that were adequate yesterday are no more adequate today. Consistency means that it is always yesterday that has to dominate, it is always the past that has to dominate the present. That's what I mean by 'consistency'. Then you will never grow, because your youth has to be consistent with your childhood, and your old age has to be consistent with your youth -- that means you will remain childish your whole life.\nAnd that's how people are. The average mental age of human beings is only twelve years.\nThis is what happens if you enforce consistency. In childhood, a few answers were given to you; they were good for the time being, but only for the time being. More than that you would not have understood. But as you grow, those answers become out of date, those answers become confinements, imprisonments, those answers become chains. You have to constantly throw them so that you can remain fresh, so that you can respond to the reality as it is.\nBut this is how, Zareen, it goes on happening: I say one thing, you understand something else. I say one thing, you hear something totally different. Your minds are so full of your own thoughts that I say, \"Don't be consistent,\" and you hear, \"Don't be constant.\"\nPasquel was being examined for naturalization as a U.S. citizen. \"Who is the President of the United States?\" The foreigner answered correctly. \"And the Vice President?\" Again he gave the right answer. \"Could you be President?\"\n\"No, no!\"\n\"Why not?\"\n\"I am-a too busy. I work-a in the barbershop all-a day now.\"\nNow, his own occupation... he says, \"No, no! I am-a too busy. I work-a in the barbershop all-a day now.\"\nZareen, you have heard something which I have not said. Your question has come out of your own idea. You know, at Least you believe you know, that the truth cannot change.\nWho told you? And how do you know? Do you know truth? You have heard it being told to you that truth never changes; it remains for ever constant. Is it your experience? Have you known anything in life which remains always constant? Anything, I say, have you known in life which remains constant?\nEverything is changing if you look at life. If you watch life, then Heraclitus is right: you cannot step in the same river twice, because the river is constantly flowing, changing. Old Heraclitus says: The ONLY thing that never changes is\nchange. Only change is constant, otherwise everything is changing.\nIn fact, life is not a noun but a verb. If one day we want to be really scientific about our language, we will have to drop all nouns. A really scientific language will consist only of verbs. You see these trees all around and you think, \"Beautiful trees!\" But to call a tree 'a tree' is not true, because a tree is not something static -- it is a movement. By the time you utter the word 'tree' it has changed. It is no more the same tree about which you were talking One dead leaf has fallen, a new leaf is just growing, a bud is opening. The tree is growing higher -- each moment! Otherwise how is it going to grow?\nTo be exactly true about it, it is better to call it 'treeing' rather than 'a tree'. But we even call a river 'a river' -- a river is a rivering. It is a CONSTANT change! Life is not really life but only living -- there is no life as such but only living. Our languages give us a very wrong notion of the world. There is nothing like love, but loving.\nAlways remember... we have to use nouns because otherwise it will be very difficult to explain things to each other. For centuries we have used nouns. But whenever you use the word 'love', remember it is 'loving' -- it is a process. It is not a thing, constant.\nIf you have loved, Zareen, you will know: morning it has one colour, afternoon it has another colour, by the evening it is a totally different phenomenon. Sometimes the river is very deep and sometimes it is very shallow. And sometimes it makes much noise, and sometimes it is very silent. So is love. Sometimes it is sad, and sometimes it is a rejoicing. It changes its moods constantly. So the only constant thing is change. But you say:\nTHE TRUTH cannot change...\nWHO HAS ORDAINED IT, THAT TRUTH CANNOT CHANGE? What do\nyou mean by it? Have you known anything in life that never changes? The child becomes the young man, the young man becomes the old man, and the old man is gone one day -- dust unto dust. You go on seeing that everything is constant change, but there seems to be a fear deep down in the human heart: the fear is death. If change is there, then death is bound to happen. Change brings death in.\nSo we want to believe in something permanent, absolutely permanent. It may be truth, it may be God, it may be soul, but something is needed for the fearful heart\nto cling to so that death can be defied. At least one can believe, \"There is something permanent in which I can have a shelter, which can become my security.\"\nDo you know truth? Do you know God? Do you know the soul? No, you know only death -- which happens every moment, all around. But we go on defying death; we don't want to look at it, because it reminds us that we are going to die. We would like something that remains for ever and for ever. And we would like to be part of it so that we can also remain for ever and for ever.\nBut what is permanent in you? Your body changes -- you can ask medical science: your body changes constantly. Just ten years ago they used to think that the body changes totally in seven years' time, becomes completely new, not even a single cell remains of the old; but now further research has shown that the body changes totally in one year.\nThe body is continuously renewing itself.\nThat's why when you cut your hair and your nails it does not hurt -- why? The hair is part of your body and the nails too, and you are cutting them and it doesn't hurt? The reason is that your hair is not alive. These are the dead cells of the body that are being thrown out of the body. So are the nails -- just dead cells being thrown out of the body to make place for the new ones to happen. That's why it doesn't hurt if you cut them.\nIn a single year, your body is no more the same.\nBuddha used to say again and again that life is like a flame. You burn a candle, you light a candle in the evening; the whole night it burns. In the morning you are just going to put it out -- a question can be asked of you: \"Is it the same flame you started in the evening that you are putting out?\" In a sense it is the same flame, because it continued the whole night; but in truth it is not the same flame, because the flame has been constantly changing, becoming smoke, and a new flame is replacing it. And the replacement is so quick that the old going into smoke and the new coming into existence is so fast that there is no gap between the two -- hence you cannot see it, hence you cannot see that it is not the same flame. Then Buddha had to invent a new idea.\nThe scientists now call it 'continuum', 'continuity' -- it is neither the same nor not the same, it is a continuity, a continuum. Buddha calls it SANTATI -- the first\nflame gives birth to another and that gives birth to another, and so on and so forth, one flame goes on giving birth to another. The whole night the birth process continued. So it comes into the same line, but it is not the same. You cannot say that it is different, you cannot say it is the same. In a sense it is different, in a sense it is the same.\nHave you known, Zareen, anything in life which is really permanent? -- anything? Your body changes, your mind changes continuously, your emotions go on changing. About WHAT truth are you talking?\nYes, there is one truth which never changes, but that has to be experienced. Don't take it as a belief. And that truth is not something outside you; that truth is hidden in you -- that truth is your capacity to witness. Only the witness never changes, everything else goes on changing. There is a consciousness inside you that goes on watching and watching all the changes -- the childhood comes and goes, the youth comes and goes, the old age comes and goes, and there is a witness inside who is simply watching.\nAll meditation is nothing but an effort to know this witness. There is no God outside you who is permanent, never changing; there is no truth outside you which is for ever. Yes, there is a certain reality inside you, at the deepest core of your being... but to find it, Zareen, you will have to go deep in meditation. When all thoughts disappear, and all desires are gone, and when there is nothing to witness, then you become aware of the witness. Then witnessing turns upon itself. Having nothing else to see, it starts seeing itself If something remains there as an object, it remains focussed on the object.\nMeditation is a process of taking all objects away from you; all contents of the mind are to be taken away. Slowly slowly, one day... the interval, the gap. Sudden emptiness.\nWhen there is nothing to see, no content to focus on, then the miracle happens. The witnessing energy, finding nothing else to obstruct it, turns in a circle back upon itself.\nThis is what Jesus calls 'metanoia', which has been wrongly translated as 'repent'. It should be translated as 'return', not 'repent'; it should be translated as 'revolution', a one-hundred-and-eighty-degree turn -- and then suddenly you see yourself. And this witness has no name. It is neither Hindu nor Mohammedan; it\nis neither man nor woman: it is just pure consciousness.\nYes, this pure consciousness is absolutely the same. Except this, everything else changes.\nAnd when I was talking to you about consistency I was not talking about the witness, I was talking about your ideologies, about your knowledge, about your experiences. They have all to be dropped every day: die every day to the past so you can remain fresh, so that you can respond to the reality as it is in the moment, not according to the past.\nAnd listening to me, be alert, be very alert about each single word; otherwise, I will say one thing and you will understand something else. And you will go on thinking that I have said it.\nThese cats are having themselves a little jam session. They are really wailing. Pretty soon they hear a knock on the door; one of them opens up and the owner of the building is standing there. \"I am sorry to burst in on you like this,\" said the landlord, \"but do you know there is a sick old lady moaning upstairs?\n\"No,\" said the cat, \"but if you give us the first few bars we can pick up on it.\" The third question\nQuestion 3\nOSHO, WHAT IS IMPORTANT?\nSambodh,\nIT DEPENDS ON YOU. If you ask me, to me it is all the same. You can say that everything is important, or you can say nothing is important. Both mean the same.\nEverything is ordinary, or everything is extraordinary. Whatsoever you want to choose, whichever word appeals to you -- everything is important, everything, not excluding anything at all; or nothing is important. Both mean the same, because the moment everything is important, or everything is not important, the very word 'important' loses meaning. The meaning remains only if there are some things which are important and some things which are not important, a few\nthings ordinary and a few things extraordinary. Then the word carries meaning. But if everything is exactly either important or unimportant, then the word loses meaning.\nMy own suggestion is you can choose either, because the ultimate result will be the same.\nIf you have a negative mind, then the Buddhist answer will be perfectly right. Buddha says: \"Nothing is important.\" Then there is nothing to make any fuss about. When hungry, eat; when thirsty, drink; when sleepy, sleep -- nothing is important. And this will give you a kind of relaxedness, a calmness -- nothing is important, so whether you succeed or fail it is all the same, whether you become famous or notorious, it is all the same, whether anybody knows you or nobody knows you doesn't matter. It will give you a very relaxed, still, tranquil state of being -- and that is the purpose!\nOr you can choose Shankara's answer. He says: \"Everything is important, because all is God, even the dust is divine.\" That too is perfectly right; you can choose that. Then, too, when hungry, eat, because it is important; and when thirsty, drink, because it is important; and when sleepy, sleep, because God is feeling sleepy -- the God within you.\nThese are the two answers, the basic answers: positive and negative. Just watch your own mind... whichever appeals to you. There are people who are basically attracted towards the positive, or towards the negative. Feel your own attraction, what attracts you more.\nAnd whichever attracts you more, that can become your path: NO can become your path, res can become your path.\nKabir's path is that of YES. Buddha's path is that of NO. But, really, YES and no are not significant. What is significant is totality. If you say yes with your total being it is totality that liberates. If you say no with totality, it is totality that liberates. But it all depends on you.\nThere are not some things labelled as important and other things labelled as unimportant.\nA roseflower may be important to a poet and may be utterly unimportant to somebody who is only interested in money. For him, a note, a hundred-rupee\nnote, is more important. He will ask, \"What is the use of the roseflower?\" In fact, he will be very much worried why people go on singing songs of rose flowers -- \"Why don't they sing songs of hundred-rupee notes?\"\nWhen I was at university I had a colleague who was really a money-maniac; his whole interest was money. Even somebody else's hundred-rupee note, and he would take it in his hand and he would touch it with such love that you may not have even touched your woman with that love -- with such care, with such tender hands, as if the note was alive.\nAnd his eyes would shine, candles would burn in his eyes when he saw a note -- even if it was somebody else's note. A note is a note! And his whole thinking was money: how to have more money?\nAnd then there is the one about the shipwrecked Englishman: as he gets out of the water onto the beach of a remote island, he is greeted by another man standing in the shade of a palm tree. \"Pleased to meet you,\" says he, and then enquires, \"Eton?\"\n\"Yes,\" responds the new arrival. \"Oxford?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Guards?\"\n\"Yes.\" \"Homosexual?\" \"No.\"\n\"Pity!\"\nIt depends on you what is important. How can I say what is important? To me, nothing is and everything is.\nThe fourth question\nQuestion 4\nOSHO WHAT TO DO WITH THE FEELING OF HELPLESSNESS AT THE\nFRUSTRATION IN FINDING THAT NOTHING IS ULTIMATELY SATISFYING --\nALL IS NOT ENOUGH?\nDeva Alla,\nIF THIS IS YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE, then the question won't arise -- then how can you ask the question? The question arises out of some lingering hope somewhere in the unconscious: \"Maybe there is a way to make it still. Maybe I have not tried enough, maybe I have not put my energy totally in it. Hence it is not satisfying. But if you yourself have felt that nothing is ultimately satisfying, if this is your experience, how can the question arise? It is so.\nIn that very experiencing, in that very understanding, you will be relaxed. Why ask that anything should be ultimately satisfying? Why not be satisfied with whatsoever life gives you? -- even if it is only for the moment. Why be greedy? Alla, you seem to be very greedy. You seem to be of that old, rotten type of spiritual person -- greedy. He wants everything for ever, for ever. If he falls in love with a woman, he wants her to remain of the same age for ever, for ever. He himself will be growing old -- that is another thing.\nBut the woman has to remain young.\nIt is these greedy people who have created the ideas of paradise, FIRDAUS. In their paradise, women never grow old. All women in paradise are stuck at the age of sixteen.\nMust be getting tired... for millions and millions of years stuck at sixteen. But it says nothing about the men -- it may be because the scriptures are written by men. If women were writing scriptures then they would write something else: men will be stuck somewhere at eighteen.\nAnd the same people who go on condemning all kinds of things here go on promising the same things a thousandfold, for eternity, in paradise. What kind of logic is this? Alcohol is prohibited here by the Mohammedans, but in their\nfirdaus, in their paradise, rivers of alcohol flow -- rivers! You need not go to a pub; you need not only drink, you can swim, you can dive.\nThis is strange! -- but not really. The greedy mind is there. The greedy mind is ready to sacrifice the momentary joy of being in a pub, of drinking a little bit, for the ultimate joy of drinking and drinking forever.\nThese same religious people who go on condemning the feminine body -- all the religions have committed that crime -- that shows simply only one thing, that the people who were writing those scriptures were deeply sexually repressed people. It shows nothing else. It says nothing about the women, it simply shows something about the scripture writers, that they were deeply repressed people -- they were afraid of women.\nBut here they are afraid, and here they go on telling everybody: \"Beware! Woman is the door to hell!\" And the same people provide you with beautiful women in heaven -- the most beautiful. Do you know? -- in paradise women don't perspire, they don't need deodorants. Their bodies have a perfume of flowers -- a natural perfume, not created by some artificially manufactured perfume. Just naturally like flowers -- roses. Their bodies are made of gold. What greed! And what are you going to do with a woman whose body is made of gold? You will be stuck! But the greed, the greedy mind fantasizing.\nAll these scriptures are pornographic. This is real spiritual pornography: women with bodies of gold, studded with diamonds, no perspiration, natural perfume, and always young, and all beautiful.\nOne great saint died, and by coincidence his great disciple also died after a few hours.\nThe great disciple was very much excited about seeing his master again. And he was thinking on the way -- it is a long journey from the earth to paradise -- he was thinking,\n\"My master must have been received by angels playing on their harps and beautiful women dancing, and he must have been given the most beautiful women because he was such a great saint, such an ascetic. When he was on the earth he had never touched any woman. What to say about touching? He had never allowed any woman to enter into his house. He had never seen any woman face to face; if he had to talk to a woman he would always look downwards or\nwould keep his eyes closed.What great austerities he went through! Now he must be being rewarded.\"\nAnd he reached and he saw his master -- and, really, he was rewarded. He was sitting under a tree, a beautiful tree, a golden tree; leaves of emerald and flowers of diamonds --\nand Marilyn Monroe, utterly naked! hugging him. The disciple fell at the feet of the master and said, \"My great master, I was waiting for this. This was due! You have been rewarded well.\"\nAnd the master said, \"You stupid fool! Keep your big mouth shut -- you have not grown at all. You don't understand anything. She is not my reward -- I am her punishment!\"\nBut these greedy people.…\nDeva Alla, if you know from your own experience that all is frustrating ultimately, everything only brings joy for the moment, then why not be happy with the moment?\nWhy ask that it should be there for ever?\nI teach you the joy of the moment. Live in the moment, and whatsoever the moment makes available, enjoy it, celebrate it. While it lasts, dance! And when it has gone, be grateful that it had come. Why ask that... NOTHING IS ULTIMATELY SATISFYING --\nALL IS NOT ENOUGH? Nothing can be done about it! This is so. This is how the reality is, and the reality is not going to change its ultimate law for you. Nobody can be all exception.\nBut if this experience has not yet become your own, then you will have to suffer a little more. You will have to hope a little more. When understanding arises, hope disappears.\nThat does not mean that one becomes hopeless: that simply means that one accepts the life as it is, and whatsoever it gives one accepts with gratitude and has no complaint.\nIn order to get a job with the railroad, Angelo had to pass a test. \"Suppose two trains were heading for each other at a hundred miles per hour on the same track,\" asked the personnel manager, \"what would you do?\"\n\"I take-a the red flag and wave-a them to e-stop,\" Angelo answered. \"But you don't have a red flag,\" pointed out the man.\n\"Then I am-a take-a the switch iron and change-a the tracks.\" \"You don't have a switch iron either.\"\n\"Well, in that case,\" decided the Italian, \"I'm gonna call up-a my wife, Maria.\"\n\"What has your wife got to do with two trains coming at each other at a hundred miles an hour?\" exclaimed the man in charge of hiring.\n\"I tell-a her to come down 'cos she has-a gone see the biggest-a mess-a in the whole world!\"\nYOU can do whatsoever you can do, and when nothing can be done it is better to call the wife and see -- and enjoy it! Learn to enjoy not only the pleasures of life but the pains too, not only the ecstasies but the agonies too. And the person who can enjoy the agonies is liberated.\nThe fifth question Question 5\nOSHO, DURING THE TWO MONTHS THAT I HAVE BEEN HERE, I OFTEN FEEL\nTHE THREAT OF A NEW KIND OF TOTALITARIANISM. IT IS CONTINUALLY\nPRESENTED AS THE SOLUTION: BE TOTAL IN THIS AND THAT EVEN IN NOT\nBEING TOTAL. BEING TOTAL, WITHOUT FRAGMENTATION ANY MORE, IS\nNOT THAT A FINAL STATE, THE LAST STAGE ON THE WAY? SO IS NOT THIS\nADAGE CREATING A NEW IDEAL WITH ALL ITS FRUSTRATIONS AND\nNEUROSIS TO FOLLOW? ANYWAY, FOR ME, NOT BEING A SUPERMAN, IT IS\nVERY RARE THAT I AM ABLE TO DO, TO EXIST, TO FEEL MYSELF TOTAL IN\nANYTHING, AND I HAVE NO REASON TO HOPE THAT IT WILL EVER HAPPEN\nAS A CONTINUOUS STATE. SINCE IT SEEMS TO BE THE CONDITION FOR THE\nTHINGS THAT ARE PROMISED HERE IS THERE STILL ANY HOPE FOR ME?\nEduard Povel,\nTOTALITY IS NOT A GOAL. Totality is not perfectionism. Totality is simply a vision of seeing the life in a different light. For example, you are angry. You can be half-heartedly angry, then the remaining part that has not been expressed will remain in you as a poison.\nAnd if again and again this has been done, you go on accumulating poison in yourself.\nThen a moment comes when you may not be angry in particular, but you are still in anger for no reason at all. That's how people are -- they are just angry, illogically angry, because right now there is no reason to be angry, but all the anger that they have repressed in the past has accumulated, has gone deep into their bloodstream, has poisoned them, has become toxic. It has created a certain musculature, a wrong kind of musculature in their bodies. And that is going to destroy many many beautiful things in their lives.\nIf such a man is going to see a sunset, he will not see any beauty in it. He is in such a rage! If such a man goes to listen to music, he will not be able to listen to\nit, because to be able to listen to great music you need a relaxed state. He cannot relax. He is carrying so many tensions, the whole life's accumulated tensions.…\nWhen I say be total I simply mean... I am not giving you a superhuman ideal. I am simply giving you a very human vision that when you are angry, then BE angry! Then don't repress it. If it is too risky to be angry with somebody, then go into your room and be angry alone, but express it. Beat the pillow, shout at the walls, make a picture of your wife and beat it! But do something -- do what you really wanted to do with the wife.\nIt is really a good idea to have an effigy of your wife, or if you are a wife then an effigy of your husband, so whenever the need arises you can go and be as nasty as you feel like being -- and with no danger of retaliation. And you will be surprised: after beating your wife, in her absence, after shouting nasty things, using four-letter words, then when you see your wife you will be surprised -- you will feel compassion for her. You may even feel ready to apologize. You may be able to see her in a different way, because you are no longer carrying that subtle layer of anger -- it has been released. You may be able to see her face again after years.\nWhen I say be total I simply mean don't repress things, because the repressed things are bound to rebound on you, those repressed things are going to take revenge, they are going to explode with vengeance one day. Those repressed feelings are creating all kinds of neurotic, psychotic people in the world. To be total is not a goal! To be total is only a way of life.\nAnd you say: BEING TOTAL WITHOUT 'FRAGMENTATION ANY MORE, IS NOT\nTHAT A FINAL STATE...?\nYes, it is a final state too -- but the first step is the last step, and the beginning is the end.\nIt is a means and an end too. You have to begin. I know you cannot be total right now.\nSlowly slowly, you will be able to become total, because the society has not allowed you to be total in anything; it has allowed you only so far. It has made you very lukewarm; it has taken away all passionate energy from your being.\nHence, you don't really love madly, you don't really go into anger madly, you don't share totally, you cannot commune\n-- everything is just so-so. And, hence, so much dust has gathered on your face.\nTotality has to be started; it is the beginning and the end too. In the beginning it is going to be difficult because you will be going against the current of the society, but that's what sannyas is: taking courage to be oneself And I don't expect you to become total right now, But the decision will help. If you decide to be total, slowly slowly you will be more and more total, degrees and degrees, by degrees one day you will attain to the hundred-degree point.\nAnd the miracle is: when one can go into one's emotions a hundred percent, all that is wrong starts disappearing. That is the miracle! And all that is right starts growing. A really total person will not be able to be angry. In the beginning when you start you will be more and more angry, but soon the point comes when you are totally angry and you have seen the naked futility of anger, the utter absurdity of anger, the insanity of anger --\nWhen YOU have seen it -- not because Buddha has said so or I have said so -- when you have seen it, it will drop. The seeing is enough. You need not drop it: it drops of its own accord.\nA total person will be able to love and will be unable to hate. A total person will be able to be compassionate and will be unable to be angry. But that is the end. I am not telling you to be a Buddha right now. But one has to begin somewhere; one has to start moving in the direction of being a Buddha.\nYou are right: it is the final state, the last stage on the way. But the w ay is also part of the last stage. The way and the goal are not separate. The goal is just the other end of the way. And the beginning is THIS end and the goal is THAT end, and the way joins both, is the bridge.\nEduard, I am not teaching you any kind of perfectionism, I am not saying you any ideals.\nTotality is certainly not all ideal -- it sounds as if it is. It is just a different style of life.\nRight now you are living a life-style which can be called partial -- only parts of\nyour being are allowed to surface, only the tip of the iceberg. You are living in fragments, you are living split. This is a kind of schizophrenic life.\nMisery is bound to be the outcome of it -- misery and only misery. Bliss is the consequence of being one, integrated. That's exactly the meaning of the word 'yoga': union, integration, oneness.\nYOU say: I HAVE NO REASON TO HOPE THAT IT WILL EVER HAPPEN AS A CONTINUOUS STATE.\nWho is telling you to make it a continuous state? Why do we always think of the future?\nWhy do we make things unnecessarily difficult? For a certain reason -- there is a motive.\nFirst you make something very difficult, then you can say, \"This is not possible. I cannot do it,\" and it is finished. There is no need for it to be total, there is no need for it to be continuous.\nThat's why it looks contradictory, paradoxical, but I say to you that when sometimes you are not total then be total in it -- then don't be total! Then accept it -- that \"This is the moment when I am not total.\" Then don't hide it, then don't fight it. If it is not possible, it is not possible. Don't feel guilty for it; you are not committing a sin. It is your life: if you want to be total sometimes, good; if sometimes you enjoy not being total, for a change, perfectly good!\nThe sixth question Question 6\nOSHO, THE RAJKOT NEWSPAPER, JAI HIND, RECENTLY QUOTED THE PRIME\nMINISTER, MORARJI DESAI, AS SAYING, WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT\nWESTERNERS COMING TO THIS ASHRAM, THAT THEY WERE THE RUBBISH\nOF THE WEST THOSE THROWN OUT FROM THEIR SOCIETIES. AND WHEN HE\nWAS ASKED ABOUT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RAJNEESH INTERNATIONAL\nUNIVERSITY, HE SAID THAT ALL SUCH UNIVERSITIES WHEREVER THEY\nEXIST, SHOULD BE CLOSED DOWN. HE SAID HE DID NOT WANT ANY SUCH\nUNIVERSITY TO COME INTO BEING, AND THAT YOU ONLY TALKED OF SEX\nTHROUGHOUT THE DAY.\nHE ALSO EXPRESSED HIS GREAT RESENTMENT OF SUCH OBSCENE\nINSTITUTIONS, AND SAID HE WOULD LIKE THEM CLOSED DOWN ALL OVER\nTHE WORLD AND THAT THEY WERE NOT AT ALL NECESSARY. DO YOU\nHAVE ANY COMMENT?\nKrishna Prem, IT IS JUST BULLSHIT! The last question\nQuestion 7\nOSHO WHY DO YOU USE SUCH DIRECT LANGUAGE AGAINST THE POLITICIANS? CAN'T YOU BE A LITTLE INDIRECT AND DIPLOMATIC?\nGirish,\nI DON'T EXPECT THE POLITICIANS to understand even the direct language. If I am indirect there is no hope that they will ever understand. They do not understand even my absolutely direct, frank, blunt language. I don't mince words. I simply say it as it is. That too they cannot understand.\nIn fact, only the third-rate minds become interested in politics. Anyone who has some kind of intelligence will do something else. He may become a scientist, he may become a poet, a dancer, a musician. He may become a mystic. Why in the world would he like to become a politician? That is only for those who have no other possibility of expressing themselves, who have no other intelligence.\nThe politician needs no other qualification, no talent. In fact, the more unintelligent he is, the greater is the possibility of his being successful.\nA tourist was visiting New Delhi. Walking on a side street late one evening, the visitor was held up by a bandit. \"Give me your money!\" he threatened, \"or I will blow out your brains.\"\n\"Blow away...\" said the tourist.\nIn New Delhi you can live without brains but not without money. I have to be direct. And I am not a politician, so why should I be diplomatic? Truth is never diplomatic -- it is straight.\nAnd the politicians cannot understand what I am doing here, and I don't expect them to understand. It will be great if they simply ignore us. That's enough. If they forget all about us. that is more than can be expected.\nA German philosopher pleaded with Adolf Hitler not to mistreat the Jews if for no other reason, he said, than just because they are so smart.\n\"What makes you think the Jews are so smart?\" asked the dictator. \"Come, and I will show you. '\nHe took the Nazi leader to Gutman's Gift Shop and said, \"Ask him for a lefthanded teapot.\"\nThe Fuhrer did. Gutman went to the back of the store, picked up a teapot, turned it around, and returned. \"You are in luck,\" said Gutman, handing the teapot to Hitler, \"I just happen to have one left.\"\nBack out on the street the philosopher said, \"You see, that's what I mean about the Jews being so smart.\"\n\"What is so smart about that?\" exclaimed Hitler. \"He just happened to have one left.\"\nYou can't expect politicians to understand much. They are bound to misunderstand even my direct statements. And if I start making indirect statements they will create more complexities. Then there will be more chances of misunderstandinng.\nLevi closed his shop Friday night and headed for temple services not realizing his fly was unzipped. At the entrance he met Mrs. Weiss, the president of the Ladies' Auxiliary. \"I don't like to say nothing,\" she said shyly, \"but your business is open.\"\n\"You are mistaken lady, ' said Levi.\n\"Believe me,\" said Mrs. Weiss, blushing, \"your business is open.\"\n\"You are crazy!\" shouted Levi rushing inside. \"I close the store every Friday to come here.\"\nLater at home, Levi saw that his fly was open and realized that Mrs. Weiss had only been trying to tell him so in a delicate way. He telephoned her immediately. \"I want to apologize.\" he said, also trying to be tactful, \"but tell me somethin' -- when my business was open, was my salesman in or out?\"\nThe Fish in the Sea is Not Thirsty Chapter #10\nChapter title: Music That No Fingers Enter Into 20 April 1979 am in Buddha Hall\nArchive code: 7904200\nShortTitle: FISH10\nAudio: Yes Video: No Length: 107\nmins\nHAVE YOU HEARD THE MUSIC THAT NO FINGERS ENTER INTO?\nFAR INSIDE THE HOUSE ENTANGLED MUSIC --\nWHAT IS THE SENSE OF LEAVING YOUR HOUSE?

BUT IF INSIDE HE IS COLOURLESS, THEN WHAT?\nKabir says: EVERY INSTANT THAT THE SUN IS RISEN, IF I STAND IN THE TEMPLE, OR ON A BALCONY,\nIN THE HOT FIELDS, OR IN A WALLED GARDEN, MY OWN LORD IS MAKING LOVE WITH ME.\nWHAT IS GOD? THE MOMENT THE QUESTION IS ASKED, the idea of a\nperson arises in the mind -- and God is not a person. Those who think of God as a person start, from the very beginning, moving in a wrong direction. They will never arrive. They will go round and round in circles, they will travel much, but they will never reach anywhere.\nIf the first step is wrong then all else goes wrong. The first step has to be absolutely right, because the first step is half the journey already. In fact, as fact, as you are concerned, the first step is the whole of the journey -- because the other step is to be taken towards you by God.\nYou take one step, he takes the other step... and the meeting. And the distance between you and God is only two steps. The initiative has to be from your side.\nGod is not a person, but that's what you have been told down the ages. God is a presence.\nGod is not substance but significance. Once God is understood as significance, your life starts changing. Then you don't argue about God, whether he exists or not; then you are no more interested in theology. The whole of theology becomes rubbish. Then you start moving in a totally different way, in an altogether different dimension.\nIf God is significance, then you have to create a certain meaning in your life, because only meaning can meet the meaning. You have to create significance in your life, because only significance can meet the significance. You have to become more aware, more loving, more aesthetic, more sensitive.\nIf God were a person it would have been a totally different approach. God is not a person but only a fragrance. You will need great sensitivity to comprehend that significance, that fragrance, that music.\nIn these sutras today, Kabir is talking about something very fundamental. Listen to his words -- don't only hear: listen. And don't only listen: meditate with him, go with him. He is not a philosopher, he is not propounding a system of thought\n-- he is a poet. He is singing his own experience. He is not concerned with concepts. He is pouring his heart into his songs, he is pouring himself into his words.\nYou have to be very sensitive to understand this great poetic expression of mysticism, this great poetic expression of religion. And religion can only be\nexpressed through poetry, through music, through dance. Any other way of expressing religion falls short, is inadequate. The mysterious has to be indicated only by something mysterious. God cannot be approached through the mind of calculation, mathematics. It is not possible to approach God through prose. The door opens only when you approach him through poetry.\nPoetry is more liquid, more vague, not so solid as prose. Prose says something clearly, poetry only hints. Prose shouts, poetry only whispers. Prose is for the mundane world, poetry is for the sacred.\nSo whenever it happens that a person becomes a Buddha, his expression, without any effort, becomes that of poetry. He may not compose poetry literally, but whatsoever he says, whatsoever he is, is poetry.\nKabir was absolutely illiterate, never went to any school, was not able to read or write; still, when it happened, he exploded in great poetry.When the experience arose in his being, when the doors opened and mysteries were revealed, he bloomed in thousands of flowers. No other poet can be compared with Kabir. There have been greater poets than Kabir, but they were mere poets -- talented, with great art, but Kabir has a personal experience of the divine which is missing in other poets. They may be talking about God, but it is mere talk. With Kabir it is not just talking: it is his heartfelt experience -- it is existential.\nHAVE YOU HEARD THE MUSIC THAT NO FINGERS ENTER INTO?\nThe original is:\nSUNTA NAHIN DHUN KI KHABAR, ANAKAD KA BAJA BAJTA?\nSUNTA NAHIN DHUN KI KHABAR...\nWhy are you not listening to the inner music which is constantly arising? You are made of it! It is not something foreign to you. It does not come from the outside. It is the music of your very existence, of your being; it is the music of your inner harmony, it is the music of your inner rhythm.\nSUNTA NAHIN DHUN KI KHABAR...\nWhy don't you listen to the inner rhythm of your being?\nWhere do you go on rushing to? And you are searching for this inner rhythm --\nsometimes in money, sometimes in power, sometimes in prestige, sometimes in so many kinds of relationships. You go on begging. You want to know something of the transcendental, you are thirsty for the transcendental.\nAnd once in a while, even in ordinary life, it happens. You how those few moments when suddenly one day you wake up in the morning and everything seems to fit perfectly. The birds are singing, the air is fragrant, the sun is rising, and suddenly you feel that all is quiet. You are no longer separate for a moment... you feel a great joy arising in you for no reason at all. You suddenly feel vibrant, utterly rejuvenated, at home. Maybe the night's deep sleep and rest, maybe the beautiful morning, the song of the birds, the fresh air, the dewdrops on the grass leaves shining in the early sun -- all this created the context. Not by your effort, but just by accident. you fell in harmony with yourself and with existence. And remember, it happens always together: whenever you fall in harmony with yourself, you fall in harmony with existence too.\nHarmony has two sides: the individual and the universal. If the individual is in harmony, then there is no reason why he should not be in harmony with the whole. If inside you all conflict has disappeared, even for a single moment, in that moment you are part of the whole, you are no more an island, you are no more separate. All walls have suddenly disappeared; you are no more imprisoned.\nIn that moment you know the glory, the splendour, that life is. That splendour is God, that feel is God. That experience of harmony is God. God is not a person but the presence that is felt when you are in harmony and you are also in harmony with existence -- that accord. That accord is called DHUN.\nSUNTA NAHIN DHUN KI KHABAR...\nListen to that accord! which is available every moment of your life. It happens only accidentally, because you have not prepared yourself for it, to receive it consciously. So it happens only once in a while.\nOnce Leo Tolstoy was asked, \"How many experiences did you have of divine ecstasy in your life?\"\nHe started crying, great tears started rolling down from his eyes. He said, Not more than seven in my life of seventy years, but I am grateful for those seven moments. I am miserable also, because in those moments it was so self-evident that is could be the flavour of my whole life. In those moments I was so certain that this could be my experience day in, day out, year in, year out -- this could spread over my whole life, this could become my flavour. But it didn't happen. Those moments came on their own and they went on their own. But I am still grateful to God that even without any conscious effort on my part, once in a while he has been knocking at my doors.\"\nTHIS HAPPENS TO EVERYBODY -- it happens in spite of you. If you look back you can remember a few moments.… and those will be the moments when you were relaxed, those will be the moments when there was no particular desire in your mind, when you were not worried, when you were not tense, when somehow you simply were.\nWatch these sudden accidental moments minutely, because there is the secret key. That's how the fundamentals of religion have been discovered: watching these sudden moments which come and go, and one never knows why they come and why they go, watching the context, the space in which they happen, people started trying to create that context.\nIf it happens in a relaxed state, when you are very loose, non-tense, then you can create the context! You can relax. If it happens to you while swimming, then you can swim and create the context. If it happens to you while running... and it happens to different people in different ways. Many runners know it, that beyond a certain limit if you go on running, go on running, go on running, suddenly it happens -- because man's energies have three layers.\nThe first layer is only for day-to-day activities; it is a very thin layer. It is enough for your office, wife, children -- the ordinary life. The second layer is for emergencies: your house is on fire; you may have been feeling very tired after the whole day's work and you were coming home and hoping to have a good rest, and suddenly when you come home your house is on fire. Immediately, all fatigue disappears -- you are no more tired. You have forgotten all about rest, and the whole night you try to put the fire out. And even after the whole night's\nwork, you are not tired. It was not the ordinary level of energy that worked\n-- that was exhausted -- the emergency layer started working.\nAnd the third layer is deeper than that. If you go on and on For example, if for\none day, two days, three days, you go on working, then the emergency level will also be finished -\n- and then you come in contact with the cosmic layer. And that is the source of life, and that is inexhaustible. And whenever you are in contact with it, tremendous joy starts overflowing you.\nIt happens to joggers, to runners, to swimmers sometimes. First layer finished, then the second layer, and if you go on running the second is also finished -- and the moment you are in contact with the third, tremendous ecstasy happens for no reason at all.\nIt may happen to you while making love. It may happen to you while listening to music.\nIt may happen to you while simply lying in your bed doing nothing. It may happen to you while painting, absorbed, utterly absorbed in it. Or it may happen in a thousand and one ways. But watch: whenever it happens, whenever that tremendous blissful moment comes to you, when God knocks on your door, watch in what context it is happening. Be alert!\nLook around -- in what space it is happening. And then you have the key. Whenever you will be able to create that context, that space, the moment will come again.\nYou cannot make it happen, but you can make yourself available for it to happen. You cannot force it to happen, but you can create all that is necessary for it to happen. It is not a doing on your part: it is a happening. But, still, you can play a great role. That's how all techniques of meditation have been developed. That's how Yoga came into existence.\nSUNTA NAHIN DHUN KI KHABAR...\nThat accord is present in you, because without it you cannot be alive. That music is already there, flowing underground in you, because that music is your\nconnection with the whole. Once it is cut you will be dead. You are alive -- that is enough proof that the music is happening. The only thing is to go deep inside your own being and to find WHERE it is happening.\nHAVE YOU HEARD THE MUSIC THAT NO FINGERS ENTER INTO?\nAnd this is a music that is not created by fingers on any musical instrument. There is no musical instrument within you, and there is nobody playing on the instrument. It is pure music.\nThe Indian mystics use a special word for it: ANAHAD KA BAJA BAJITA -- ANAHAD\n-- it is boundless, and it is uncreated. It is the sound of one hand clapping. But the Indian mystics go a little deeper; they say there is not even one hand clapping -- there is neither hand nor instrument, but pure music, just music.\nThe experience of the mystics is that life consists of the stuff called music. Just as physics says life consists of electrons, electricity, mystics say life consists of music. And in a way they are both right, because music is nothing but a certain vibration of electricity, and it may be true vice versa also: electricity may be nothing but a certain density of music, of sound.\nHAVE YOU HEARD THE MUSIC THAT NO FINGERS ENTER INTO?\nKABIR IS TALKING TO HIS DISCIPLES who have come to seek God. Somebody must have asked him about God, and he is talking about music. To talk about God is almost useless, but to talk about music is certainly of great significance. If you can hear your inner music, you will know God is.\nFAR INSIDE THE HOUSE ENTANGLED MUSIC -- WHAT IS THE SENSE OF LEAVING YOUR HOUSE?\nAnd Kabir says: Where are you going to find God? People go to Kashi and to Kaaba, and people go to Jerusalem and to Tibet, and people go to all kinds of\nplaces in search of some significance. They are feeling that their life is meaningless, they are feeling that their life is empty, they are feeling that their life is nothing but a long long tale told by an idiot. They know that their life is just noise, meaningless, gibberish. They know that deep down there is nothing but a kind of hollowness. And they search: there must be some source somewhere which can quench their thirst. There must be some place somewhere where they can encounter God, where they can attain to some significance, where their life can have some meaning. But this search is futile. They will be frustrated again and again -- because the truth they are searching for is already within their being. What they are seeking is in the seeker himself; the sought is in the seeker. You need not go anywhere. You simply have to learn how not to go anywhere.\nThe greatest art is just to be, without going anywhere. Not going to the past, not going to the future, not going into desires, into psychological spaces, into psychic travels -- not to go anywhere, just to be. And right now! if you are just here... immediately something is felt, something which is intangible. You cannot show it to anybody else; you cannot share your experience with somebody who has not known it. But your whole being starts feeling a kind of intoxicatedness, a drunkenness. You become full of juice, you become full of aliveness, and a very indirect, subtle, delicate experience of the presence of something bigger than you\n-- that's what God is all about. FAR INSIDE THE HOUSE...\nThe original is:\nRAS MAND MANDIR BAJTA BAHAR SUNE TO KYA HUA?\nKabir says: That music is already happening inside your own temple. Kabir calls you 'the temple' -- except for your body there is no other temple in the world. Your bodies are temples, sacred places, because the holiest of the holy resides in you. And look at what the priests have been telling you, what your so-called saints have been telling you. They have been teaching you life-negative attitudes, body-negative attitudes. They have been telling you that the body is the culprit, that the body is the source of sin. They have been telling you to torture the body, to destroy the body. They have been teaching you that unless you\ndestroy your body totally you will not be able to know God.\nThe truth is just the contrary: unless you love your body immensely, respect your body immensely, you will not be able to know God at all -- because the body is his outer expression. If the body is the temple, then God is the deity inside it.\nRAS MAND MANDIR BAJTA...\nWithin the temple of your body the music is already happening -- just go in. And the word RAS has to be understood. RAS literally means juice. And you will be surprised to know that the mystics of this country have called God the ultimate juice: RASAO VAI SAHA -- he is the ultimate juice. But if you go to your so- called saints, you will find them very dry, with no juice at all. You will find them almost dead, with no life flowing in them. And they have destroyed their bodies; they are living a kind of death. But this is thought to be very respectable. What has really happened? What has gone wrong? Why have these pathological people, mentally deranged people, psychologically ill people, become so dominant? Why have they possessed religion?\nThe neurotic people have one quality in them: the quality of being fanatics. Only neurotics can be fanatics, and it is very difficult to fight with fanatics. Wherever a fanatic is, sooner or later he is going to become a leader. He is so troublesome, he is such a trouble-maker, that you have to make him a leader; that is just to pacify him. He will only be at rest when he is at the top, when he is the boss.\nNeurotics have a tendency to become leaders. Adolf Hitler was a neurotic, and became one of the greatest leaders of human history. He was a madman, but madmen have a few qualities in them which no sane man can ever have: they compete, and they compete with their total energy, and they compete madly. Because they are so mad, they don't think, they act. While the sane person thinks, the mad person acts. The sane person goes on thinking and the mad person has already reached and acted and done. The sane person thinks of consequences, the mad person thinks nothing -- he simply rushes in.\nAdolf Hitlers become leaders in politics, and the same kind of people become leaders in religion too. And the pathological people also have a tendency to become organized. The sane person wants to be left alone because he enjoys his aloneness; he wants his own space, he wants freedom -- freedom from the crowd. And the mad person wants the crowd. Left alone he becomes disturbed;\nin his aloneness he starts seeing his madness. He goes always into the crowd; he wants to live with the crowd twenty-four hours a day -- he is a lover of the crowd.\nThe sane person moves in solitude and the insane person searches for the crowd. And your religions are nothing but crowds. Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Jainism -- different crowds. When Mohammed became enlightened, he was alone, meditating in the mountains. When Buddha became enlightened he was alone, meditating by the side of the River Niranjana, under a tree -- alone. When Mahavira became enlightened he was absolutely alone in the forest, standing underneath a tree, naked in the sun.\nEnlightenment has happened to people when they were utterly alone. But leadership does not come that way. Leadership comes when you move into the crowd. Not only that: when you fulfill the expectations of the crowd -- stupid expectations, superstitious expectations, but you have to fulfill the expectations of the crowd -- then you become the leader religious or political. Mad people have a great organizing capacity. Because they fulfill the expectations of the crowd, the crowd looks up to them, the crowd respects them, and the crowd is afraid -- everybody is afraid -- and the crowd wants to be organized because in organization there seems to be power.\nAn NAACP official telephoned the Library of Congress and told the chief librarian that the library had eighteen thousand books with the word 'nigger' in them and that all the books had to be removed in a week.\n\"But,\" protested the librarian, \"we have fifty thousand volumes with the word 'bastard' in them.\"\n\"I know,\" said the official, \"but those bastards are not organized.\"\nIn this world, organization is power, and mad people have a great magnetic force to organize. They cannot be alone, they seek others; and others who cannot be alone, they are also seeking. It becomes a mutual arrangement.\nReligions, at the source, are born out of a meditative aloneness, but the moment it becomes known that a Buddha has happened, the mad people start organizing, the mad people start gathering a crowd. And that crowd finally crystallizes into Hinduism, Mohammedanism, Christianity. All their notions are based not in the enlightenment of their founders, real founders, no, but in the pseudo founders,\nthe priests.\nAnd these priests have been telling you that life is irreligious, that the body has to be denied, it is not a temple, it is not a place to be worshipped in.\nKabir is saying a totally different thing, and that's what my emphasis is: the body is sacred -- because ALL IS sacred!\nHAVE YOU HEARD THE MUSIC THAT NO FINGERS ENTER INTO?\nFAR INSIDE THE HOUSE ENTANGLED MUSIC --\nWHAT IS THE SENSE OF LEAVING YOUR HOUSE?\nWhere are you going? You need not leave the body, you need not leave anything, you need not renounce anything! Remember -- Kabir never renounced anything. He lived a very ordinary life just as everybody else lives -- the life of a householder. He was a father, a husband, and his whole life he continued to work. He was a weaver -- he continued to weave clothes. Even when he had thousands of disciples. And many times his disciples would come to him and say, You need not work at all. We are ready to provide everything for you, and your needs are not many. Why do you go on working?\nAnd Kabir would laugh and say, \"You don't understand. I work for God, I weave clothes for God -- because the customers who come to purchase clothes from me are divine. How can I stop my work?\"\nThis quality is true religiousness. And this quality is possible only if you are in love with life, and to be in love with life creates RAS -- juice. Then you don't become dry, then you don't become a desert, then you become an oasis\nThe so-called religious people of this country are against me because I am teaching you the way of RAS -- the way of life, love, juice, music -- because I am teaching you to become an oasis, not a desert; because I would like you to be in a constant rejoicing; because I am not teaching you renunciation but rejoicing, all the people who have been carrying this nonsense idea of renouncing the\nworld are bound to be against me. That is natural. It is expected. This has been happening always, and it seems, unfortunately, that man has not learnt anything at all down the ages. It is exactly the same today as it was in the days of Buddha, as it was in the days of Jesus, as it was in the days of Kabir.\nSUPPOSE YOU SCRUB YOUR ETHICAL SKIN UNTIL IT SHINES,\nBUT INSIDE THERE IS NO MUSIC, THEN WHAT?\nMORALITY IS NOT RELIGION, although a religious person is always moral -- but not vice versa: a moral person need not be religious. A religious person is necessarily moral, because religion means experience of the divine -- one who has experienced the presence of God, how can he be immoral? In fact, he is the criterion, the decisive factor as to what is moral.\nWhatsoever an enlightened person does is moral; there is no other way to decide. It is not that he is thing to do that which is moral -- whatsoever he does is moral. He cannot do any harm to anybody; he is a blessing to existence. When God has blessed him, what else is left for him, except to be a blessing to the existence? What God has given to him, he goes on giving to everybody else. His heart is full of bliss, and the bliss starts overflowing. That overflowing bliss is real morality.\nMorality means compassion, morality means love, morality means creativity; morality means making the world a little more beautiful than you found it, leaving it a little more beautiful, giving it a new plane, a new level, a new dimension of existence.\nThe immoral person is destructive; because he is miserable he can only share his misery with others. Remember, you can give to others only that which you have. If you are miserable, whatsoever you say is immaterial, you will make others miserable. If you are blissful, you need not say anything -- you will make others blissful. Your very presence will trigger some blissfulness in their being. Your very presence will create a synchronicity in others. Your music, your juice, will create ripples of joy -- whoever is close to you will become infected with your joy, with your ecstasy, will become drunk --\nand that's what morality is. Kabir says:\nSUPPOSE YOU SCRUB YOUR ETHICAL SKIN UNTIL IT SHINES,\nBUT INSIDE THERE IS NO MUSIC, THEN WHAT?\nThen what is the use of it? Yes, that can be done, that is being done. There are people who go on cultivating character, who go on cultivating morality. And they become great moralists. puritans, very righteous. They do only that which is right but it is a forced doing, it is not spontaneous -- it is not out of their being, it is just a forced phenomenon. It is a facade. They have created a beautiful curtain around themselves, behind it is the corpse, the stinking corpse, but on the surface they have decorated themselves with flowers. And the crowd can be deceived by them, but deep down they are the same people, even worse, because all that they are showing on the surface is pseudo. They are just the opposite inside. They are hypocrites. They say one thing, they are just the opposite of it; they do one thing, but their being has no correspondence with it. They are split, they are schizophrenic.\nBecause of this cultivated morality, we have put the whole of humanity in a state of schizophrenia. Everybody is more or less made into a hypocrite. The society forces you to do it. If you don't do it, you cannot live, you cannot survive. It has become almost a necessity that you don't show your reality. You show only that which people want you to show, and you keep everything else hidden inside. But then your inner being goes on accumulating poisons and poisons and poisons, and you live a hell within, decorated with beautiful flowers. And those flowers are also plastic, because they cannot be true flowers.\nTrue flowers need roots in your being.\nA really religious person has no morality imposed upon himself. His morality arises out of his consciousness. He is not trying to do the right, he is not trying to avoid the wrong -\n- -he simply remains conscious and acts out of his consciousness, and whatsoever he does is right. In fact, it is impossible to do anything wrong consciously.\nA beautiful story is told about a great mystic, Nagarjuna: He was a naked fakir, but he was loved by all real seekers. A queen was also deeply in love with Nagarjuna. She asked him one day to come to the palace, to be a guest in the palace. Nagarjuna went. The queen asked him a favour. Nagarjuna said, \"What do you want?\" The queen said, \"I want your begging bowl.\"\nNagarjuna gave it -- that was the only thing he had -- his begging bowl. And the queen brought a golden begging bowl, studded with diamonds and gave it to Nagarjuna. She said, \"Now you keep this. I will worship the begging bowl that you have carried for years\n-- it has some of your vibe. It will become my temple. And a man like you should not carry an ordinary wooden begging bowl -- keep this golden one. I have had it made specially for you.\"\nIt was really precious. If Nagarjuna had been an ordinary mystic he would have said, \"I cannot touch it. I have renounced the world.\" But for him it was all the same, so he took the bowl.\nWhen he left the palace, a thief saw him. He could not believe his eyes: \"A naked man with such a precious thing! How long can he protect it?\" So the thief followed.…\nNagarjuna was staying outside the town in a ruined ancient temple -- no doors, no windows. It was just a ruin. The thief was very happy: \"Soon Nagarjuna will have to go to sleep and there will be no difficulty -- I will get the bowl.\"\nThe thief was hiding behind a wall just outside the door -- Nagarjuna threw the bowl outside the door. The thief could not believe what had happened. Nagarjuna threw it because he had watched the thief coming behind him, and he knew perfectly well that he was not coming for him -- he was coming for the bowl, \"So why unnecessarily let him wait? Be finished with it so he can go, and I can also rest.\"\n\"Such a precious thing! And Nagarjuna has thrown it so easily.\" The thief could not go without thanking him. He knew perfectly well that it had been thrown for\nhim. He peeked in and he said, \"Sir, accept my thanks. But you are a rare being -\n- I cannot believe my eyes. And a great desire has arisen in me. I am wasting my life by being a thief -- and there are people like you too? Can I come in and touch your feet?\"\nNagarjuna laughed and he said, \"Yes, that's why I threw the bowl outside -- so that you could come inside.\"\nThe thief was trapped. The thief came in, touched the feet... and at that moment the thief was very open because he had seen that this man was no ordinary man. He was very vulnerable, open, receptive, grateful, mystified, stunned. When he touched the feet, for the first time in his life he felt the presence of the divine.\nHe asked Nagarjuna, \"How many lives will it take for me to become like you?\" Nagarjuna said, \"How many lives? -- it can happen today, it can happen now!\"\nThe thief said, \"You must be kidding. How can it happen now? I am a thief, a well-known thief The whole town knows me, although they have not yet been able to catch hold of me. Even the king is afraid of me, because thrice I have entered and stolen from the treasury. They know it, but they have no proof. I am a master thief -- you may not know about me because you are a stranger in these parts. How can I be transformed right now?\"\nAnd Nagarjuna said, \"If in an old house for centuries there has been darkness and you bring a candle, can the darkness say, 'For centuries and centuries I have been here -- I cannot go out just because you have brought a candle in. I have lived so long'? Can the darkness give resistance? Will it make any difference whether the darkness is one day old or millions of years old.\nThe thief could see the point: darkness cannot resist light; when light comes, darkness disappears. Nagarjuna said, You may have been in darkness for millions of lives -- that doesn't matter -- but I can give you a secret, you can light a candle in your being.\"\nAnd the thief said, \"What about my profession? Have I to leave it?\"\nNagarjuna said, \"That is for you to decide. I am not concerned with you and your profession I can only give you the secret of how to kindle a light within your being, and then it is up to you.\"\nThe thief said, \"But whenever I have gone to any saints, they always say, 'First stop stealing -- then only can you be initiated.'\" It is said that Nagarjuna laughed and said,\n\"You must have gone to thieves, not to saints. They know nothing. You just watch your breath -- the ancient method of Buddha -- just watch your breath coming in, going out.\nWhenever you remember, watch your breath. Even when you go to steal, when you enter into somebody's house in the night, go on watching your breath. When you have opened the treasure and the diamonds are there, go on watching your breath, and do whatsoever you want to do -- but don't forget watching the breath.\"\nThe thief said, \"This seems to be simple. No morality? No character needed? No other requirement?\"\nNagarjuna said, \"Absolutely none -- just watch your breath.\"\nAnd after fifteen days the thief was back, but he was a totally different man. He fell at the feet of Nagarjuna and he said, \"You trapped me, and you trapped me so beautifully that I was not even able to suspect. I tried for these fifteen days -- it is impossible. If I watch my breath, I cannot steal. If I steal, I cannot watch my breath. Watching the breath, I become so silent, so alert, so aware, so conscious, that even diamonds look like pebbles.\nYou have created a difficulty for me, a dilemma. Now what am I supposed to do?\"\nNagarjuna said, \"Get lost! -- whatsoever you want to do. If you want that silence, that peace, that bliss, that arises in you when you watch your breath, then choose that. If you think all those diamonds and gold and silver is more valuable, then choose that. That is for you to choose! Who am I to interfere in your life?\"\nThe man said, \"I cannot choose to be unconscious again. I have never known such moments. Accept me as one of your disciples, initiate me.\"\nNagarjuna said, \"I have initiated you already.\"\nReligion is based not in morality but in meditation. Religion is rooted not in\ncharacter but in consciousness. A really religious person has no character at all -- he is characterless.\nBut let me define what I mean by 'characterless': I don't mean the ordinary meaning that you will find in the dictionary -- because in the dictionary, the man of bad character is called characterless. That is wrong, because he has a character\n-- maybe it is bad, but he is not characterless. Somebody has good character, somebody has bad character -- both have characters. The sinner and the saint, both have characters, but the really religious man is characterless. He is neither good nor bad -- he is beyond. He has no character because he does not function out of his past: he acts moment-to-moment, he acts spontaneously; he has no ready-made formula, he has no routine. He does not act out of habits -- and that's what character is: creating good habits is good character, creating bad habits is bad character. Creating consciousness, not habits, is religiousness.\nSUPPOSE YOU SCRUB YOUR ETHICAL SKIN UNTIL IT SHINES,\nBUT INSIDE THERE IS NO MUSIC, THEN WHAT?\nYou can go on scrubbing your ethical skin, you can go on polishing your morality, you can become a really polished man, but if inside there is no music, if meditation has not happened, if you have not heard the unheard, if you have not seen the unseen, if you have not penetrated into the unknowable, if that soundless sound is not heard, it is all futile.\nYou are simply wasting your time. A Zen story:\nA disciple is meditating and he has been meditating for at least twenty years. He has been doing all kinds of things: yoga postures, meditative techniques. One day the Master appears, and the disciple is sitting like a Buddha, absolutely silent -- at least on the outside -- unmoving like a marble statue. And the Master starts rubbing a brick on a stone just in front of him. The Master creates so much noise by rubbing the brick on the stone that the disciple has to open his eyes a little bit and see who is creating the nuisance.\nSeeing that the Master himself is doing this, he cannot believe it. A Master is not supposed to disturb the disciple while he is meditating. What kind of Master is he? But a Master is a Master, so you cannot be rude to him. He waits, but how long can you wait?\nConstant rubbing of the brick on the stone -- his teeth are getting on edge. Finally he says, \"Stop it! What are you doing?\"\nAnd the Master says, \"And what have you been doing for twenty years? Scrubbing, scrubbing... trying to polish your mind? That you call meditation? Your postures, your techniques -- they are all mind-based. I am trying to make a mirror of this brick!\"\nThe disciple says, \"That is impossible. You can go on rubbing, but the brick will never become a mirror.\"\nAnd the Master says, \"That's what I have come to say to you. Twenty years you have been rubbing, scrubbing, polishing, and the mind has not become meditation and the mind has not become a mirror. Drop the mind! Don't cultivate it.\"\nBy dropping the mind it becomes a mirror. Mind itself never becomes a mirror. Mind is the barrier. Hidden behind the mind is your consciousness. And once you enter behind the mind you hear the music. That music transforms you into a new being -- it is a rebirth.\nMOHAMMED'S SON PORES OVER WORDS, AND POINTS OUT THIS\nAND THAT,\nBUT IF HIS CHEST IS NOT SOAKED DARK WITH LOVE, THEN WHAT?\nKABIR SAYS THIS IS SO WITH EVERYBODY -- the Hindu pundit goes on speculating upon words, playing upon words. The Mohammedan scholar, Mohammed's son, PORES OVER WORDS.… Words have become so important that we have forgotten that we have to enter into a wordless state of\nconsciousness. Go on repeating the Koran, or the Bible, or the Vedas, and it is of no use at all, because you will only be gathering more and more knowledge -- all borrowed. And a truth borrowed becomes a lie. A truth expressed in words immediately loses its truthfulness. Words are too small; they cannot contain the great sky of the truth within themselves. They crush the truth, they destroy it.\nAnd when words reach you, you will give a meaning to them which is yours.\nKrishna speaks, Jesus speaks, I am speaking to you... if here there are two thousand people, do you think everybody is hearing the same thing? There are two thousand meanings. The speaker is one, my meaning is one, but immediately I assert it it becomes two thousand -- two thousand meanings.\nA shaggy tale used by New Testament scholars to poke a little fun at their more skeptical associates begins when several archaeologists working near Jerusalem unearth some human skeletal remains. Upon examination they prove to be the bones of Jesus.\nOverwhelmed by the burden of such unsettling knowledge, the archaeologists decide to inform the Pope. The Pope, of course, is shocked. What does this mean for the future of the Christian faith?\nIf those bones are really those of Jesus, that means he was never resurrected, that means the resurrection was false, that the whole story was invented. And with the resurrection disappearing the whole ground underneath Christianity will disappear.\nBefore releasing this information to the press and allowing it to be sensationally exposed to the stunned eyes of the faithful, the Holy Father determines to call a council of the world's great theologians to see if they can help him understand and interpret this calamitous event. What is more, because the implications of the news obviously affect all Christians, it seems wise to make this an ecumenical council, one to which theologians of all denominations will be invited. Slowly and painfully, his Holiness works his way down the list of theologians, making telephone calls to each of them. All are heard to make the appropriate gasps of dismay, after which they promise to hasten to Rome for the conference.\nThe last name on the Pope s list is that of a German New Testament scholar with a reputation for being highly skeptical with respect to all manner of historical\ninformation about Jesus. The Holy Father debates with himself whether this gentleman should be informed, but finally, in the interests of ecumenism and because in this case such an already formed attitude of skepticism might actually be of some use, he makes the telephone call. The German critic, instead of being overwhelmed by the news that Jesus'\nbones had not been resurrected, registers his surprise in a fashion which takes the Pope's own breath away.\n\"Ach so,\" the scholar responds, \"then he did live!\"\nOne is worried about resurrection -- the same news -- but the other's response is totally different. His worry is, \"Ach so, then he did live!\" If the bones are genuine, then Jesus becomes a historical figure.\nWhenever you hear something it is always from your background that you hear it; it is your background that interprets it. The meaning is given by you.\n\"Young man said the judge, looking sternly at the defendant, \"it is alcohol and alcohol alone that is responsible for your present sorry state!\"\n\"I am glad to hear you say that,\" replied Mooney with a sigh of relief, \"Everybody else says it is all my fault!\"\nIt is natural that words will be interpreted by each person according to his own past.\nThat's why it is so much insisted on again and again by me to please listen to me without bringing in your past, listen to me without any background; listen to me not as Christians, Hindus and Mohammedans, otherwise you will miss it. Not only will you miss it: you will misunderstand it.\nListen to me as you listen to music or the sound of running water or the wind passing through the pine trees, and then there is a possibility of some communion happening, a possibility that some meaning that I am trying to convey reaches you. But it is really difficult. It is one of the most difficult things in the world to be a disciple.\nTo be a disciple means listening without any background, just listening without interpreting, just listening without for or against, without believing, without\ndisbelieving -\n- a pure kind of listening. And the beauty of truth is that if you can listen silently with no judgement, if it is true it will ring bells in your heart. But the bells will be rung in the heart, not in the head. If it is untrue, no bells will be rung in the heart. You will know whether it is true or untrue -- not by thinking about it, but just by listening in total silence.\nMOHAMMED'S SON PORES OVER WORDS, AND POINTS OUT THIS\nAND THAT,\nBUT IF HIS CHEST IS NOT SOAKED DARK WITH LOVE, THEN WHAT?\nUnless your heart responds, the head cannot become a bridge to God. Your heart needs to be soaked with love. But you don't know anything about the heart. The society has not allowed you to go through the heart; it has tried in every way to bypass the heart. The whole effort of the society is to pull you to the head directly without moving through the heart, because the ways of the heart are mysterious, uncontrollable.\nThe ways of the head are controllable, manipulatable. Hence the society is interested in your head, not in your heart. The society wants you to understand that there is no heart but only the head. The heart is nothing but a blood-pumping system; that's what the society wants you to believe This is one of the greatest untruths ever told.\nBy 'heart' is not meant the physical part. The physical part is simply a blood circulation system, but hidden behind the physical, just corresponding to it, very close to it, behind it, is the real heart. Just as hidden behind the brain is mind, so hidden behind the lungs is the heart, hidden behind the body is the soul.\nDon't be finished with the physical. Always remember: corresponding to each physical phenomenon in you there is a spiritual phenomenon. Unless your heart starts functioning, IS SOAKED DARK WITH LOVE... and why dark? Because love has the depth of darkness, the density of darkness. Love grows in\nmysterious ways not in the light, because light makes everything demystified. Love is more dark than anything else. It is a dark, dense, mysterious world.\nAnd if you are afraid of the dark, you will be afraid of love too. If you are afraid of the night, you will be afraid of love too. If you are afraid of the dark, the night, death, love, then you are afraid of all that is mysterious -- then you have to exist only on the surface, then you will never be able to penetrate to the center of being.\nThe original is:\nIK PREM-RAS CHAKHA NAHIN, AMLI HUA TO KYA HUA?\nYou have not tasted the juice of love -- and you have become a great saint? and you have great character and great morality? And you have not even tasted the juice of love? Then all your saintliness and all your morality is holy cow-dung. You are carrying an unnecessary weight. The sooner you drop it the better.\nTHE YOGI COMES ALONG IN HIS FAMOUS ORANGE. BUT IF INSIDE HE IS COLOURLESS THEN WHAT?\nThe real question is of getting coloured inside. The outer colour is only symbolic. It is a gesture; it is not the end -- it is the beginning. It is simply your saying that I am ready.\"\nBut don't think that if you are wearing orange then sannyas has happened. Your gesture has happened, you have moved on the way.\nThere are two initiations. One is the formal: the day you become a sannyasin, you change to orange -- that is formal. But without the formal, the informal is difficult. If you cannot even change your clothes, how will you change your being? But just changing your clothes is not synonymous with changing your being.\nKabir says:\nTHE YOGI COMES ALONG IN HIS FAMOUS ORANGE.\nBUT IF INSIDE HE IS COLOURLESS, THEN WHAT? VAKIF NAHIN US RANG SE\nKAPARE RANGE SE KYA HUA?\nYou have not known the colour of God, you have not know the colour of love, you have not known the colour of life. Orange is the colour of blood, life; orange is the colour of fire, love; orange is the colour of the sunrise, the transforma-tion\n-- the declaration that the night has ended.\nBut the being has to be coloured. Your soul has to become red with love, with joy, with celebration. In India, orange is the colour of spring -- a springtime has to come into your inner being so that flowers that have waited and waited for centuries can bloom, so that buds can open.\nKabir says:\nEVERY INSTANT THAT THE SUN IS RISEN,\nIF I STAND IN THE TEMPLE, OR ON A BALCONY, IN THE HOT FIELDS, OR IN A WALLED GARDEN, MY OWN LORD IS MAKING LOVE WITH ME.\nMeditate over this tremendously important statement:\n... MY OWN LORD IS MAKING LOVE WITH ME.\nTHE MAN OF ABSOLUTE CONSCIOUSNESS remains in a constant orgasmic state.\nJust as two lovers reach an orgasmic climax only for a moment and then it is gone, and a sadness comes in the wake, so the man of total awareness, the Buddha, the enlightened person, remains for twenty-four hours a day in an orgasmic state:\n... MY OWN LORD IS MAKING LOVE WITH ME.\nAnd wherever I am, Kabir says, it makes no difference -- in the temple or in the\nmosque or in the fields or in a walled garden -- it doesn't matter where I am. Wherever I am, my Lord, my Beloved, is making love with me.\nLove is the quintessence of religion. And to be orgasmic is to be a sannyasin -- and to become so orgasmic that it continues day in, day out; even when you are asleep, the meeting continues. You go on melting and merging into God, and God goes on melting and merging into you.\nThe wall between you and the whole has been removed, there is no separation. That state of non-separation, that state of UNIO MYSTICA -- the mystic union -\n- is the ultimate expression of love. The lowest is the man/woman relationship and the ultimate, the highest, is the meeting of the meditator with the whole.\nHence I say the journey is from sex to superconsciousness. Sex is the beginning of the journey -- don't reject it. If you reject the beginning, you will never reach the end. But remember that it is only the beginning; don't get stuck there. You have to go farther and farther ahead; you have to transcend it. And as you go higher in meditation, the less and less sexual you are bound to become.\nThis is happening every day to my sannyasins. The whole country thinks that here nothing but sex is happening, but the reality is just the opposite. This may be the only place where thousands of people are totally losing interest in sex -- because going through it is going beyond it. To go beyond one has to go through, because without knowing it there is no way to transcend it.\nThe sexual orgasm reveals two secrets to you: one is that in the climax, at the peak, the ego disappears; and the second, time disappears. And these are the two secrets of meditation. One day meditating you will come to know that sex is not needed at all because the ego and time can disappear without going into sex at all.\nSex is a natural way of meditation; it is a gift of nature, to keep reminding you that this is possible. Mind, time, ego, all can disappear; if they can disappear for a single moment, then why not for ever? Sex is a natural window into God, but only a window. You need not remain confined behind it. You can jump out of the window and you can come into the open, in the sun, under the sky. But the window made it possible for you.\nBecause sex helps you to know a few moments of egolessness, timelessness, mindlessness, it makes it possible that you can long for, desire a permanent state,\nan eternal state of orgasmic joy -- satchitanand.\nKabir is absolutely right. Nobody else has said it so clearly: My own Lord is making love with me, and every moment of the day, irrespective of where I am, of what I am doing.\nThis has to become the experience of each of my sannyasins.\nThis is my message to you. You have to actualize this potential in you. One day you have to be able to declare to the world: \"The Lord is making love with me twenty-four hours a day. I am in an orgasmic state. Not only am I in an orgasmic state, but I am the orgasmic state.\"\nThat's what enlightenment is all about. Once it is achieved, nobody can fall from it. Once it is achieved, all is achieved.\nThe Fish in the Sea is Not Thirsty Chapter #11\nChapter title: The Paradox that Life is. 21 April 1979 am in Buddha Hall Archive\ncode: 7904210\nShortTitle: FISH11\nAudio: Yes Video: No Length:\n110\nmins\nThe first question Question 1\nOSHO, PLEASE COMMENT ON THE ART OF BALANCED LIVING. MR LIFE IS\nOFTEN AN EXPERIENCE OF EXTREMES, WITH THE MIDDLE ROAD DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME.\nGregg Johnson,\nLIFE CONSISTS OF EXTREMES. Life is a tension between the opposites. To be exactly in the middle for ever means to be dead. The middle is only a theoretical possibility; only once in a while are you in the middle, as a passing phase. It is like walking on a tightrope: you can never be exactly in the middle for any length of time. If you try, you will fall.\nTo be in the middle is not a static state, it is a dynamic phenomenon. Balance is not a noun, it is a verb; it is BALANCING. The tightrope-walker continuously moves from the left to the right, from the right to the left. When he feels now he has moved too much to the left and there is fear of falling, he immediately balances himself by moving to the opposite, to the right. Passing from the left to the right, yes, there is a moment when he is in the middle. And again when he has moved too much to the right, there is fear of falling, he is losing balance, he starts moving towards the left. Passing from the right to the left, again he moves through the middle for a moment.\nThis is what I mean when I say balance is not a noun but a verb -- it is balancing, it is a dynamic process. You cannot be in the middle. You can go on moving from left to right and right to left; this is the only way to remain in the middle.\nDon't avoid extremes, and don't choose any one extreme. Remain available to both the polarities -- that is the art, the secret of balancing. Yes, sometimes be utterly happy, and sometimes be utterly sad -- both have their own beauties.\nOur mind is a chooser; that's why the problem arises. Remain choiceless. And whatsoever happens and wherever you are, right or left, in the middle or not in the middle, enjoy the moment in its totality. While happy, dance, sing, play music -- be happy! And when sadness comes, which is bound to come, which is coming, which has to come, which is inevitable, you cannot avoid it... if you try to avoid it you will have to destroy the very possibility of happiness. The day cannot be without the night, and the summer cannot be without the winter, and life cannot be without death.\nLet this polarity sink deep in your being -- there is no way to avoid it. The only way is to become more and more dead. Only the dead person can be in a static middle. The alive person will be constantly moving -- from anger to compassion, from compassion to anger. And he accepts both! And he is not identified with either. He remains aloof and yet involved. He remains distant yet committed. He enjoys and yet he remains like a lotus flower in water -- in water, and yet the water cannot touch it.\nGregg Johnson, your very effort to be in the middle, and to be in the middle for ever and always, is creating an unnecessary anxiety for you. In fact, to desire to be in the middle for ever is another extreme, the worst kind of extreme, because it is the impossible kind.\nIt cannot be fulfilled.\nJust think of an old clock: if you hold the pendulum exactly in the middle, the clock will stop. The clock continues only because the pendulum goes on moving from the left to the right, from the right to the left. Yes, each time it passes through the middle, and there is a moment of that middleness, but only a moment. And it is beautiful! When you pass from happiness to sadness, and from sadness to happiness, there is a moment of utter silence exactly in the middle -- enjoy that too.\nLife has to be lived in all its dimensions, only then is life rich. The leftist is poor, the rightist is poor, and the middlist is dead! The alive person is neither rightist nor leftist nor middlist -- he is a constant movement, he is a flow.\nWhy do we want to be in the middle in the first place? We are afraid of the dark side of life; we don't want to be sad, we don't want to be in a state of agony. But that is possible only if you are also ready to drop the possibility of being in\necstasy. There are a few who have chosen it -- that is the way of the monk. For centuries that has been the way of the monk. He is ready to sacrifice all possibilities of ecstasy just to avoid agony. He is ready to destroy all roseflowers just to avoid the thorns. But then his life is just flat... a long long boredom, stale, stagnant. He does not really live. He is afraid to live!\nLife contains both: it brings great pain, it also brings great pleasure. Pain and pleasure are two sides of the same coin. If you leave one, you have to leave the other too. This has been one of the most fundamental misunderstandings down the ages, that you can leave pain and save pleasure, that you can avoid hell and have heaven, that you can avoid the negative and can have only the positive. This is a great fallacy. It is not possible in the very nature of things. The positive and negative ARE together, inevitably together, indivisibly together. They are two aspects of the same energy.\nMy sannyasins, or those who understand me, have to accept both. I am giving you a totally new insight: Be all! And when you are on the left, don't miss anything -- enjoy!\nBeing on the left has its own beauty; you will not find it when you are on the right. It will be a different scene. And, yes, to be in the middle has its own silence, peace, and you will not find it on any extreme. So enjoy all! Go on enriching your life.\nCan't you see any beauty in sadness? Meditate over it. Next time when you are sad don't fight with it, don't waste time in fighting. Accept it, welcome it -- let it be a welcome guest. And see deep into it, with love, care. Be a real host! And you will be surprised --\nyou will be surprised beyond your comprehension -- that sadness has a few beauties which happiness can never have. Sadness has depth, and happiness is always shallow.\nSadness has tears, and tears go deeper than any laughter can ever go. And sadness has a silence of its own, a melody, which happiness can never have. It will have its own song, more noisy, but not so silent.\nI am not saying choose sadness: I am just saying enjoy it too. And when you are happy, enjoy happiness. Swim on the surface too, and sometimes dive deep into the river. It is the same river! On the surface the play of ripples and waves, and\nthe sunrays and the wind -- it has its own beauty. And diving deep into the water has its own quality, its own adventure, its own danger.\nAnd don't become attached to anything. There are people who have become attached to sadness too -- psychology knows about them. They are called masochists: they go on creating situations in which they can remain miserable for ever. Misery is the only thing that they enjoy, they are afraid of happiness. In misery they are at home.\nMany masochists become religious, because religion provides a great protection for the masochist mind. Religion gives a beautiful rationalization for being a masochist. Just being a masochist without being religious, you will feel condemned and you will feel ill -\n- ill-at-ease -- and you will know that you are abnormal, and you will feel guilty about what you are doing to your life. You will hide the fact.\nBut if a masochist becomes religious he can exhibit his masochism with great pride, because now it is no more masochism -- it is asceticism, it is austerity -- tapascharya -- it is self-discipline, not torture. Just the labels have been changed! Now nobody can call him abnormal -- he is a saint. Nobody can call him pathological -- he is pious, holy.\nMasochists have always moved towards religion. Religion has a great attraction for masochists. In fact, so many masochists down the ages have moved towards religion -- it was very natural, that movement -- that religion became dominated by the masochists.\nThat's why religion goes on insisting on being life-negative, life-destructive. It is not for life, it is not for love, it is not for joy. It goes on insisting that life is misery. By calling life misery, it rationalizes its own clinging to misery.\nI have heard a beautiful story -- I don't know how far it is correct, I cannot vouch for it: In paradise, one afternoon, in the most famous cafe, Lao Tzu, Confucius and Buddha are sitting, and talking sweet nothings.\nThe bearer comes and in a tray brings three glasses of the juice called life and offers them. Buddha immediately closes his eyes and he says, \"Life is misery.\"\nConfucius closes his eyes half-way -- the middlist, he used to preach the golden\nmean --\nand asks the bearer to give him the glass because he would like to have a sip, just a sip, because without tasting how can one say whether life is misery or not? He had a scientific mind. Confucius was not very mystic; he was a very pragmatic, earthbound mind. He was the first behaviourist the world has known, very logical.\nAnd it looks perfectly right: he says, \"First I will have a sip and then I will say.\"\nHe takes a sip and he says, \"Buddha is right -- life is misery.\" Lao Tzu takes all the three glasses and he says, \"Unless one drinks totally how can one say anything?\"\nHe drinks all the three glasses and starts dancing! Buddha and Confucius ask him, \"Are you not going to say anything?\" He says, \"This is what I am saying -- my dance, my song.\"\nUnless you taste totally, you cannot say. And when you taste totally, you cannot say because what you know is so much that no word is adequate.\nBuddha is on one extreme, Confucius is in the middle, Lao Tzu has drunk all the three glasses. The one that was brought for Buddha he has drunk, and the one that was brought for Confucius he has drunk, and the one that was brought for him he has drunk -- he has lived life in its three-dimensionality.\nMy own approach is that of Lao Tzu.\nGregg Johnson, live life in all possible ways; don't choose one thing against the other, and don't try to be in the middle. And don't try to balance yourself -- balance is not something that can be cultivated by you. Balance is something that comes out of the experience of all the dimensions of life. Balance is something that HAPPENS; it is not something that can be BROUGHT. If you bring it it will be false, forced; and if you bring it you will remain tense, you will not be relaxed, because how can a man who is trying to remain balanced, in the middle, be relaxed? He will always be afraid: if he relaxes he may start moving towards the left or towards the right -- he is bound to remain uptight.\nAnd to be uptight is to miss the whole opportunity, the whole God-given gift.\nDon't be uptight. Don't live life according to principles. Live life in its totality, drink life in its totality! Yes, sometimes it tastes bitter -- so what? That taste of bitterness will make you capable of tasting its sweetness. You will be able to appreciate the sweetness only if you have tasted its bitterness. The man who knows not how to cry will not know how to laugh either. And the man who cannot have a deep laughter, a belly-laughter, his tears will be crocodile tears -- they cannot be true, they cannot be authentic.\nI don't teach you the middle way: I teach you the total way. And then a balance comes of its own accord. And then that balance has tremendous beauty and grace\n-- you have not forced it, it has Come. By moVing gracefully to the left, to the right, in the middle, slowly slowly, a balance COMES to you, because you remain so unidentified. When sadness comes you know it will pass, and when happiness comes you know it will pass too. Nothing remains. Everything passes by.\nThe only thing that always abides is your witnessing. That witnessing brings balance.\nThat witnessing is balance. The second question Question 2\nOSHO, HOW CAN ONE DEVELOP A CONSCIENCE -- SOMETHING WITHIN\nTHAT WILL GUIDE ONE IN ONE'S EVERYDAY LIFE TOWARDS WHAT IS\nNECESSARY FOR ONE'S DEVELOPMENT? TO DO WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR\nTHE UNFOLDING OF ONE'S INNER LIFE? IT SEEMS AS IF I AM ALWAYS TORN\nAND YET THERE DOES EXIST SOMETHING WITHIN AT TIMES WHICH I HOPE\nCOULD BE HELPED TO GROW AND BECOME A LIGHT FOR ME. CARL\nONE\nLEARN TO INTENSIFY ONE'S FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS IN ORDER TO\nBRING ONE CLOSER TO A PLACE OF REAL BEING?\nSteven,\nTHERE IS NO NEED TO DEVELOP a conscience at all. What is needed is consciousness, not conscience. Conscience is a pseudo thing. Conscience is created in you by the society. It is a subtle method of slavery. The society teaches you what is right and what is wrong. And it starts teaching the child before the child is aware, before the child can decide on his own what is right and what is wrong, before the child is even conscious of what is happening to him, before the child is even awake. In a kind of sleep, in a kind of dream, the child lives in the beginning.\nIn the mother's womb the child sleeps for twenty-four hours. Then after the birth he sleeps for twenty-three hours, twenty-two hours, twenty-one hours, twenty hours... slowly slowly. But he remains in a kind of limbo, neither awake nor asleep. The child cannot make any distinction between what is real and what is unreal. And we start teaching the child what is right, what is wrong -- we are conditioning him. We are conditioning him according to our ideas. All these ideas -- from parents, from priests, teachers, politicians, saints -- -all these ideas jumble together inside him. They become his conscience.\nAnd because of this conscience he will never be able to grow consciousness -- because conscience is a pseudo consciousness. And if you are satisfied with the pseudo you will never even think of the real. It is very deceptive; the way we have been bringing up children is very deceptive. It is ugly, it is violent, it is against humanity.\nThat's why millions of people live without any consciousness. Before they could have grown into consciousness, we gave them pseudo toys to play with. And their whole lives they think this is all that is needed to live a good life. And their whole lives they will be rewarded if they follow the conscience, and they will be punished if they don't follow the conscience.\nFrom the outside they will be punished and rewarded, and from the inside also.\nWhenever you do something that your conscience says is wrong, you feel guilty, you suffer, you feel inner pain. You are afraid, you are trembling... it creates anxiety. And the fear about heaven, that you may lose heaven, and the fear of hell, that you may fall into hell... and with great inventiveness your saints have painted the joys of heaven and the miseries of hell.\nThis is conscience. Conscience is artificial, arbitrary. Conscience is needed because the society does not want you to be intelligent. Hence, rather than making you intelligent it gives you fixed rules of behaviour: Do this, don't do that.\nThe day humanity drops this whole nonsense of conscience and starts helping children to grow their consciousness will be the greatest day, will be the real birth of humanity, a new human being and a new earth. Then we will help the child to become more intelligent, so whenever a problem arises the child has enough intelligence to encounter it, to face it, to respond to it. Why should one need any conscience? Intelligence is enough, consciousness is enough.\nConsciousness will make you capable of responding to the present immediately, and your response will be true. Conscience is old, and the situation is always new -- and your conscience is ALWAYS old. There is no meeting-ground. You go on responding according to the conscience cultivated in you by the society, forced into you by the society, conditioned in you by the society -- and the situation is totally different!\nOne of my friends went to Tibet. He is a very religious brahmin, very orthodox. He went there to study Buddhist scriptures, but he could not stay in Tibet -- he had to come back as quickly as possible. The journey was simply a sheer wastage, an unnecessary trouble, because to go into Tibet is not easy.\nAnd the problem was that from his very childhood he had been taught to take a cold bath before the sun rises. Now. to take a cold bath in Tibet before the sun rises... he was telling me that it was impossible. And if he did not take the cold bath before sunrise, the whole day he would feel guilty. He had been told that without taking a cold bath in the morning you cannot pray, your prayer is useless. And without prayer you cannot eat anything. So he was taking a cold bath in the morning, and that was dangerous to life. In Tibetan scriptures it is said that once a year it is a must that one should take a bath!\nOnce a few Tibetan lamas came to stay with me, and those were the days when Maneesha was not there and Radha was not there to smell these people -- and I suffered so much...\nFor those few, seven, eight days that they stayed in my house, I was almost out of the house. Any excuse and I would escape from the house -- the whole house was stinking, because they would not take a bath. And a hot summer in India... and they would not take any bath! They were following their conscience.\nIt has been such a difficult thing for me to talk to Jaina monks. They used to come to see me; it was so difficult to talk with them -- because they don't cleanse their mouths, rinse their mouths, they don't clean their teeth. That is not allowed. That is thought to be a part of beautifying the body -- -and how can a Jaina monk beautify the body? He is so dead set against it.\nJust to talk to them is so difficult -- they have such bad breath. It is bound to be so. And the Jaina monks are not allowed to take a bath either, because why should you be so careful about your body? -- the anti-body attitude. Their bodies stink, their mouths stink.\nOne Jaina nun became so much impressed by me and be-came so much interested in me that I told her, \"You can at least take a sponge bath -- nobody will know. Just a wet towel, you can... and nobody will ever know that you have taken the bath.\"\nThe idea appealed to her. She took one sponge bath, felt very good and very bad too. She told me, \"It feels very good and I feel fresh, but it hurts inside that I have committed a sin.\nDo you ever think when you take a bath that you have committed a sin? And she had not even taken a full bath -- just a sponge bath, just a wet towel rubbed all over the body. But she felt so guilty that she had to fast for three days as repentance.\nThis is conscience. Conscience goes on making you a fool. Situations change, but the conscience cannot change, it cannot grow -- conscience remains static. You go on living with ideas that were given to you in your childhood, by your ignorant parents, ignorant teachers. And you will live according to them, and you will suffer much. And your response will never be true because it will never fit with the situation. You will always be lagging behind.\nResponsibility simply means the capacity to respond to the reality as it is -- and it changes, the reality changes, and the conscience remains fixed. That's the difference between conscience and consciousness.\nConsciousness is a mirror. Conscience is a photoplate. Once a photoplate is exposed, it is finished; it catches the picture and then that picture remains for ever, fixed. It cannot grow, remember.\nOne woman was showing her child the family album, and they came across a picture of a beautiful man with black hair, very fresh, young. And the child asked, \"Who is this, Mom?\" And the mother said, \"Don't you recognize him? He is your father!\" And the child said, \"He is my father? Then who is that bald- headed man who lives with us?\"\nIn reality, things change. Beautiful black hair disappears -- one becomes bald- headed.\nBut in pictures things are fixed.\nConscience is a photoplate and consciousness is a mirror. It also reflects, but it never clings to any reflection. It remains empty, and hence it remains capable of reflecting new situations. If it is morning, it reflects the morning. If it is evening, it reflects the evening.\nThe photoplate is fixed; if you exposed it in the morning then it will always remain morning in the photo, it will never become evening, night.\nThere is no need, Steven, to develop a conscience. The need is to drop the conscience and develop consciousness. Drop all that you have been taught by others, and start living on your own and searching and seeking.… Yes, in the beginning it will be difficult because you won't have any map. The map is contained by the conscience. You will have to move without the map, you will have to move into the uncharted, with no guidelines. Cowards cannot move without guidelines; cowards cannot move without maps. And when you move with maps and guidelines, you are not really entering into new territory, into new realms -- you are going in circles. You go on moving into the known; you never take a jump into the unknown. It is only courage that can drop conscience.\nConscience means all the knowledge that you have. And consciousness means being empty, being utterly empty, and moving into life with that emptiness,\nseeing through that emptiness and acting out of that emptiness -- then action has tremendous grace. And then whatsoever you do is right. It is not a question of what is right and what is wrong, because something that is right today may be wrong tomorrow. And borrowed knowledge never helps.\nHomer and Jethro were digging a ditch in the blazing Mississippi sun. Seeing the boss sitting coolly in the shade above them, Homer put down his shovel and said, \"How come he is up there and we are down here?\"\n\"I dunno,\" said Jethro.\nHomer went up to the boss and asked him, \"How come you boss up here and we work down there?\"\nThe boss answered, \"Because I am smart.\" \"What is smart?\" asked Homer.\n\"Here,\" said the boss putting his hand on a tree, \"I will show you. Try to hit my hand.\"\nHomer wound up a mighty swing and let fly. Just as he swung, the boss moved his hand away, and Homer crashed into the tree.\n\"Owwww!!!\" he screamed.\nThe boss said coolly, \"Now you are smart too.\"\nHomer went back to the ditch. Jethro asked what happened and Homer said, \"Now I am smart.\"\nJethro said, \"What is smart?\" Homer said, \"I will show you.\"\nHe looked around for a tree, and not seeing one, he put his hand over his own face.\n\"Here,\" he said, \"try to hit my hand \"\nThat's what goes on with your so-called knowledge, conscience -- situations\nchange, trees are no more found... but you have a fixed routine and you cannot do anything else, you go on repeating your routine. And life has no obligation to fit with your routine. You have to fit with life.\nA VERY STRANGE, mysterious thing happened just twenty years ago in the world of modern physics. It destroyed the whole Aristotelian logic; it destroyed all ancient certainties. Physicists came to know that electrons move in a very strange way: they behave simultaneously as if they are particles and also as if they are waves. This is impossible! Either something can be a particle or it can be a wave. In the language of geometry, either something can be a point, a dot, or a line. but one thing cannot be both together: a point, a dot, and a line together. That is impossible. But that's what was happening.\nThey observed and observed, and the behaviour was such that the electrons were behaving in a very illogical way. They tried hard to figure it out, to somehow manage the old Aristotelian logic, that A is A and A is never not A. That was the two-thousand-year-old thought, deep-rooted, that A can never not be A. And that's what was happening: the particle was behaving like a wave -- A was behaving not like A. Now what to do?\nIt was difficult to discard Aristotle, very difficult -- a two thousand years' long love affair.\nBut electrons have no obligation, they don't bother at all about Aristotle. They were saying \"Get lost!\" And finally the physicists had to agree with the electrons. And when they were asked again and again \"How is it possible?\" they said, \"What can we do? It is not a question of possible or not possible -- it is happening! It is so! We understand that it is illogical, that it should not be so, but what can we do? We are helpless! The electrons don't believe in Aristotle.\"\nAristotle has been discarded -- the two-thousand-year-old tradition of logic has become simply irrelevant.\nAnother phenomenon happened after a few years: they came to know that when the electron moves from point A to B, in the middle it disappears. Moving from point A to B, you find it on the point A, then suddenly you find it on point B, but in the middle you don't find it at all.\nNow this is even more impossible. Somebody coming from Bombay to Poona; you find him in Bombay, and then you find him in Poona, and on the way\nnowhere is he found!\nThis is strange, unbelievable, but what to do? That's how it is. So another great ancient idea simply had to be dropped. The old idea was that nothing can come out of nothing.\nNow that is happening: in the middle it is nothing, in the beginning it is something, in the end it is again something. So out of something nothing comes, and out of nothing something comes again.\nBut this has been the experience of the mystics always. This is new for modern physics, but this is not new for metaphysics -- this is very ancient. Mystics have never believed in Aristotle; they have always been anti-Aristotle -- they have always been illogical, because they don't know what the way of the electron is but they know their own inner consciousness. And there too they have observed these miracles: that the ego is something, comes out of nothing, and then disappears into nothing again. The ego arises out of nothing, becomes very solid, and then one day in meditation you simply find it has evaporated again.\nThis has been one of the most ancient experiences about the ego: that one moment it is there, another moment it is not there, and again it is there. And this has been the experience about time too, that when you are in deep meditation time simply disappears and when you come out of meditation time is again there.\nThe mystics have known it, that life follows no logic, that life is basically supra- logical, that life follows no reason, that fundamentally it is irrational. Conscience is very arbitrary, artificial. It gives you a fixed pattern, a fixed gestalt, and life goes on changing, and life is very uncertain, it id very zig-zag. Unless you are conscious you will not be able to live your life truly; your life will be only a pretension, a pseudo-phenomenon.\nYou will always be missing the train.\nAnd always missing the train is what creates anguish in man. Just think of yourself always missing the train: rushing to the station, and whenever you reach the train is leaving the platform. That's what happens to the person who lives according to the conscience: he never catches the train. He cannot! He has a fixed gestalt, and life is a fluid phenomenon. He has a rocklike thing inside him and life is more like water.\nBe conscious. Don't ask how to grow, how to develop a conscience. Here we are trying to do just the opposite: destroying conscience -- the Christian conscience, the Hindu conscience, the Mohammedan conscience, the Jaina conscience -- we are destroying all kinds of conscience. And consciences come in all shapes and all sizes.\nConsciousness is neither Christian nor Hindu nor Mohammedan -- it is simply consciousness. Conscience divides people, consciousness unites.\nSteven, forget all about conscience. You ask:\nHOW CAN ONE DEVELOP A CONSCIENCE -- SOMETHING WITHIN THAT WILL\nGUIDE ONE IN ONE'S EVERYDAY LIFE...?\nWhat is the need of carrying a guide with you? Consciousness is enough! Whenever a certain need arises, your consciousness will respond. You have a mirror, you will reflect it. And the answer will be spontaneous.\nWhen I was a student at university, my professors were very much worried about me.\nThey were worried -- they loved me -- they were worried because I never prepared for the examinations. They were even worried that I might answer in such a way that the examiner may not even be able to see the point.\nMy old professor, Dr. S. K. Saxena, he used to come just early in the morning to wake me up so that I could study a little bit. And he would sit in my room saying, \"You do a little preparation.\" And he would leave me in the examination hall, then he would go home, because he was even worried that I may not go.\nAnd when it came to the final oral examination, he was very very worried, because I might say something that could offend the examiner. He was also present; he was the head of the department so he was present and the examiner was present. And he had told me, warned me again and again, \"Simply stick to the question! Whatsoever he asks, you simply answer that. Don't go into any depth about it -- just a plain answer, the answer that is given in the books will do. And I will be there and if I see that you are going astray, I will just give you a push with my foot underneath the table -- so then come back again and just stick\nto the question.\"\nThe first question and the problem arose. The professor who had come to examine asked,\n\"What is the difference between Indian philosophy and Western philosophy?\" And my professor became afraid, because he knew that the words 'Indian' and 'Western' were enough for me... and that was so. I said, \"What do you mean by Indian? Can philosophy be Indian and Western also? Then philosophy can be Bengali and Maharashtran. If science is not Indian and Western, then why should philosophy be?\"\nAnd my professor started hitting me, and I told my professor, \"Don't hit me! You just keep yourself away. This is between me and him. You are not supposed to give me any hints.\nNow the old examiner was at a loss: what to do? Whatsoever he asked, I answered him by another question. He was at a loss because he was just carrying ready-made answers. I told him, \"You look at a loss because you can't respond. Now, it is such a simple thing that philosophy is philosophy -- what has it to do with East and West? Say yes or no...!\"\nBut the fixed gestalt: Indian philosophy -- everything has to be Indian, everything has to be Western, everything has to be this and that... adjectives and adjectives. We can't think of this earth as one. We can't think of humanity as one. Now, what is Indian about Buddha? and what is Jewish about Jesus? Nothing at all. I have tasted both and the taste is the same. But borrowed knowledge always remains in you as a fixed thing, and whenever you respond out of your fixed ideas. your response falls short. It is not a true answer to the reality.\nSo, Steven, there is no need to develop a conscience to guide you -- there is no need to have any guide! All that is needed is intelligence, awareness, consciousness, so that you can respond whatsoever the case is. Life brings challenges, you bring consciousness to those challenges. And meditation is a way of dropping conscience and moving into consciousness.\nThe miracle is: if you can drop conscience, consciousness arises on its own -- because consciousness is a natural phenomenon. You are born with it; just the conscience has become a hard crust around it and is not allowing its flow. Conscience has become the rock and the small spring of consciousness is\nblocked by the rock. Remove the rock and the spring starts flowing. And with that spring your life starts moving in a totally different way that you have not even imagined before, you could not have even dreamt. And everything starts to fall in harmony with existence. And to be in harmony with existence is to be right -- not to be in harmony with existence is wrong.\nSo conscience as such is the root cause of ALL wrong, because it doesn't allow you to fall in harmony with existence. And consciousness is always right just as conscience is always wrong.\nAnd you ask: CAN ONE LEARN TO INTENSIFY ONE'S FEELINGS AND\nEMOTIONS IN ORDER TO BRING ONE CLOSER TO A PLACE OF REAL BEING?\nNeither thoughts will help to bring you closer to your being nor feelings -- but feelings are better than thoughts, closer, but not yet the real thing. First one has to drop thoughts, then one has to drop feelings, so that the inner world becomes totally empty. In that emptiness your consciousness turns upon yourself and the reality is known.\nTruth is neither a thought nor a feeling nor an emotion. Truth is the experience of consciousness of itself. Soren Kierkegaard is right when he says: \"Truth is subjectivity.\"\nMeditate and go on dropping... there are layers and layers and layers. Man is like an onion -- go on peeling. Meditation is the art of peeling the onion. And of course, when you peel the onion, tears come to the eyes -- that has to be accepted. It is painful. Go on peeling the onion till nothing is left in your hand -- that nothing is reality.\nYou can call it God, you can call it nirvana, enlightenment, or whatsoever you want to call it. Names don't matter. But the real thing happens only when NOTHING has happened.\nThe third question Question 3\nOSHO, I ALWAYS DREAM OF SEX AND SEX AND SEX -- WHY?\nRam Das,\nARE YOU A FOLLOWER of Morarji Desai? Something is basically wrong with you.\nYour dreams simply show that you are living a repressed life. Your dreams reflect how you are living your life. Your dreams are not just dreams -- they are reflections.\nIn the waking time you must be repressing sex; then, naturally, it is bound to assert itself in your dreams. Dreams only indicate that you are doing something wrong with your life.\nWhen your life is really harmonious, lived consciously, dreams disappear -- all kinds of dreams disappear. Your whole sleep becomes dreamless. That is the indication that the transformation is happening -- that happens to every meditator. As meditation goes deeper, dreams start disappearing.\nBut dreams show something about you. And you have to rethink, you have to rearrange your life. If you are dreaming only of sex, that simply shows you are sex-obsessed. And who is sex-obsessed? Whoever represses is bound to be obsessed by it. Your dreams cannot just be rejected as dreams -- as people do. They think they are just dreams, nothing to be worried about. Your dreams are symbolic. Your unconscious is trying to convey a certain message to you, that you are doing something wrong.\nRam Das, sex is part of life. You cannot deny it -- you can transcend it, but you cannot deny it. If you deny it, you will create unnecessary complexities -- it will become an obsession. And it will create perversions in your life.\nMorarji Desai drinks his own urine -- not for no reason. It is a perversion. It is rooted in sexual repression. Sexual repression can take many kinds of perverted forms.\nTrying to fall asleep, a Greek shepherd is counting sheep: \"One, two, three, four, five, hello darling \"\nAntonio: \"Last night I had a night-a mare Angelo: \"What-a happened?\"\nAntonio: \"I dreamt-a I was eating a-spaghetti Angelo: \"Why is that so bad?\"\nAntonio: \"I woke up and a-the string on a-my pyjamas was a-gone.\"\nNow Italians go on and on with spaghetti, spaghetti, spaghetti. Dreams will reflect, dreams are reflections. If sex is reflected in your dreams, reconsider your life. Drop all the old nonsense. You must be a typical Indian, Ram Das. That's what goes on in the Indian mind continuously. Even your saints are full of obsessive sex, because all ways to transcend sex have been denied them.\nYou will be surprised to know that all kinds of sexual perversions were invented by monks and nuns. And these are the people who condemn. But psychologists say that homosexuality was invented by the monks and the nuns -- homosexuality is a religious phenomenon. And so are other things...\nIf you repress something, nature is going to take revenge on you And remember, you cannot fight with nature. You can Will nature, not by fighting with it but by being with it.\nYou can persuade nature to be with you and help you. And nature is very compassionate.\nBut once you start fighting, you are bound to lose. Nature is vast and you are very tiny. It is like a wave fighting with the ocean, a small leaf fighting with the whole tree -- it is stupid! The wave can win, but not against the ocean -- with the ocean.\nAnd that's my basic teaching.\nSex can be transcended and should be transcended, but transcendence has to be not against nature but with nature, Through nature. Accept your sexuality -- it is part of you!\nand a tremendously important part. You are born out of sex. Each cell of your body is a sex cell. Sex energy is your life energy! -- respect it, it is a gift from God. Understand it.\nBe more and more meditative about it. But drop all prejudices, drop all\ncondemnations.\nbecause when you carry a condemnation you cannot understand a thing. Drop all judgements. Sex is sex -- it is a pure natural energy. With great acceptance, love, respect, meditate over it. Go deeper and deeper into it to see what exactly it is. And in that very seeing you will be going beyond it.\nThe day one has known what sex energy really is, one has transcended. Sex disappears, but it disappears not by denying. But by understanding. And the disappearance is not really the destruction of the energy but a transformation. In existence nothing is ever destroyed, things are only transformed.\nIt is sex when it is transformed that becomes love. And it is love when it is transformed that becomes prayer. And it is prayer in its ultimate transformation that becomes God.\nThe fourth question Question 4\nOSHO, I DON'T ACCEPT YOUR CRITICISM OF SIGMUND FREUD. DO YOU\nACCEPT A SANNYASIN WHO SOMETIMES SAYS NO TO WHAT YOU SAY? I AM NOT LESS NEUROTIC THAN FREUD, BUT I THINK THAT I CAN BECOME\nCREATIVE ONLY IF I LEARN TO ACCEPT THE NEUROTIC PART OF MYSELF.\nWHAT DO YOU SAY TO THIS?\nWolfgang,\nWHO HAS CRITICIZED SIGMUND FREUD? I was simply stating a few facts! To state a fact is not a criticism. If I call a blind man a blind man, I may be rude but I am not criticizing. I may be blunt, I may not be polite, but I am not criticizing.\nFreud was neurotic, and there are a thousand and one facts supporting this. Just\nlook into Freud's biographies and you will come across those facts yourself. He was a homosexual.\nHe wrote such stupid homosexual letters to a man that later on he asked the man again and again to destroy those letters, because when he became famous he was afraid that some day or other those letters would come to public notice.\nThe major part of those letters was destroyed, but a few somehow survived. His whole life he was condemning homosexuality, and he had deep homosexual tendencies.\nIt happens almost always that whatsoever you condemn in others is really your inner problem. The other is just a scapegoat.\nYou say: I AM NOT LESS NEUROTIC THAN FREUD, BUT I THINK THAT I CAN\nBECOME CREATIVE ONLY IF I LEARN TO ACCEPT THE NEUROTIC PART OF\nMYSELF.\nThat is true. That's what I teach here: accept it! Freud never accepted his neurotic part. He not only never accepted it: he tried to deny it, he tried to cover it up.\nOnce Freud and Jung were travelling in a train, and they started talking about psychoanalysis. Suddenly Jung had a great idea -- he said, \"You have psychoanalysed so many people, but you yourself are not psychoanalysed. It will be good if you also go through psychoanalysis. Somebody whom you have psychoanalysed and whose psychoanalysis is complete can psychoanalyse you!\"\nAnd Freud became so afraid -- even just the idea -- that he started trembling and he fainted. When he came back he said, \"I cannot allow that -- I cannot allow myself to be psychoanalysed. That will expose me.\"\nAnd Jung said, \"Then you are already exposed.\"\nFreud never accepted that he had any psychological problems. He tried to deny them, because the fear was that if you have psychological problems, how can\nyou be the founder of psychoanalysis? He tried to prove that he was superhuman\n-- and he was not a Buddha, he was not an enlightened person. He suffered from the same jealousies, paranoia, as everybody -- in fact more than the ordinary, average person.\nAll his old colleagues left him by and by, and the reason was: he was so jealous -\n-\nanybody who was reaching closer to him, becoming famous, known, he would feel so jealous, so afraid, that a competitor was born, that he would start attacking him. He did that to Adler, to Jung, and to many others. ANYBODY, his OWN disciples -- he was afraid of his own disciples, that they would become competitors or they may prove themselves more important than he was. He could not conceive anybody being more important in the world of psychoanalysis.\nThis is a very poor kind of mind, a very ordinary, mediocre mind. And he was so political that the whole movement of psychoanalysis was continuously in a turmoil. Conspiracies were going on for and against -- for this, against that. He was making his followers fight with each other, because that is the only way: divide and rule. He was putting one follower against another. He was running psychoanalysis as a political thing.\nI am not criticizing him. I have a great respect for the man -- in spite of all his faults he made a great breakthrough. In spite of all his human limitations he started a new dimension in human consciousness. He IS the founder of psychoanalysis, and Jung, Adler and others, nobody comes close to him; he was unnecessarily afraid. He was simply suffering from paranoia: nobody comes close to him! He was a giant among pygmies.\nBut the giant was afraid of the pygmies. He was not aware of his own strength -- he was not aware at all; that is the problem.\nWolfgang, I am not against Freud. And you ask me:\nDO YOU ACCEPT A SANNYASIN WHO SOMETIMES SAYS NO TO WHAT YOU\nSAY?\nYes, that's what I teach. When your consciousness says no, say no. When your consciousness says yes, say yes. I don't create a conscience in you. I am not creating followers here -- no, not at all -- but friends. Your no is as much respected as your yes.\nThat's the only way to show respect towards you You may not respect yourself, you may have a self-condemnatory attitude, but for me you are all potential Buddhas. How can I disrespect a Buddha? -- even though the Buddha is potential, even though you are in the seed. But I can see the flower!\nIn Kirlian photography they have discovered one thing which is very significant: with very sensitive photoplates pictures can be taken of a bud, but the picture will show not the bud but the flower that is going to happen -- because before the bud opens, the energy field around the bud opens. Just a few hours before the bud really opens, its energy field opens. and Kirlian photography takes the photograph of the energy field. The bud has not opened yet, the bud is still a bud, but Kirlian photography can give you a picture of the future. It is not future for the sensitive plate -- for the sensitive plate it is already present.\nThrough Kirlian photography, illnesses can be caught before they happen to you. To be precise: a few illnesses have been caught six months before they happened\n-- there was no possibility to even suspect that the man was going to fall ill after six months from a certain illness -- there is no way to know about it. Nothing has happened yet in the body, but something has happened in the energy field that surrounds the body. And Kirlian photography can take the photograph of the energy field and can infer through the photograph that this man is going to have cancer after six months. Now Kirlian photography is going to become a tremendously powerful instrument in the hands of the future medicine. If we can know six months before, then much can be done -- then nobody need fall ill. The illness can be prevented even before it has happened.\nAnd that's how I see you. Before my eyes you are not buds but flowers, before my eyes you are not seeds but fully grown trees -- great foliage, flowers, fruits. Before me you are Buddhas! Hence I call you 'friends'. Kabir calls his disciples: Friends, wake up!\nYou are accepted, Wolfgang, with all your nos, with all your yeses -- you are accepted as you are. I don't make any condition. If you are ready to become a sannyasin, who am I to prevent you? The chance has to be given to you to grow,\nto be.\nThe last question Question 5\nOSHO, WHY IS THE NEW GENERATION SUCH A PROBLEM TO THE PARENTS?\nNarayana,\nBECAUSE THE NEW GENERATION IS MORE INTELLIGENT. Intelligence\nbrings problems. And it is natural that the new generation should be more intelligent. That's how evolution happens. Each new generation is going to be more intelligent than the preceding one. Your children will be more intelligent than you, and your children's children will be more intelligent than your children.\nIt is a momentum, a gathering momentum. You are standing on the shoulders of the Buddhas -- the whole part is yours. For example, in my being Buddha is a part,Jesus is a part, Abraham is a part, Krishna is a part, Mohammed is a part... in that way Buddha was poorer than me, Jesus was poorer than me. And some future enlightened person will be richer than me, because I will be part of his being but he cannot be part of my being.\nEvolution goes on gathering momentum.\nEach child should be more intelligent than the parents -- but that brings trouble, because that is what offends the parents. Parents would like to pretend that they are all-knowing.\nIn the past it was easy to pretend because there was no other way to impart knowledge to the children than by the oral communication from the parents.\nFor example, a carpenter's son would learn all that he would ever learn through the father.\nThe father would not only be the father but the teacher also. And the son would always be in awe and respect of him, because the father knew so much -- he knew everything about all kinds of trees and wood and this and that, and the son\nknew nothing. He would have tremendous respect.\nAge used to be respected: the older a man was in the ancient days, the more wise, of course, because of his experiences. But now we have invented better means of communication. The father is no more the teacher; now the teaching profession is a totally different profession. The child goes to the school. The father had gone to the school thirty or forty years before. In these thirty, forty years there has happened a knowledge explosion. The child will learn something which the father is not aware of, and when the child comes home, how can he feel any awe? -- because he knows more than the father, he is more up to date than the father. The father seems to be out-moded.\nThis is the problem, and this is going to be so more and more, because our expectations are old and we still want the child to respect the parents as he used to respect them in the past -- but the whole situation has changed. You will have to learn something new now: start respecting the child. Now, the new has to be respected more than the old. Start learning from the child because he knows better than you. When your son comes from the university, he certainly knows better than you.\nThat has been my experience at university. One of my philosophy professors used to talk such nonsense, and the reason was that he had been to university thirty years before. In those days, when he was a student, Hegel and Bradley, they were the most important figures in the world of philosophy. Now nobody cares about Hegel and Bradley. Now Wittgenstein and G. E. Moore have taken their place.\nThis professor had no idea of Wittgenstein, no idea of G.E. Moore. He was so outmoded that I had to tell him. \"You are so old, so useless, that either you start reading what is happening now in philosophy or you stop teaching!\"\nNaturally, he was angry -- I was expelled from the university. He wrote a letter to the vice chancellor and said, \"Either I am going to teach or this student is to remain in the university. but we cannot both remain together -- he is trouble.\"\nHe was not ready to read Wittgenstein. In fact, I can understand his problem: even if he had read he would not have understood. Wittgenstein is a totally different world from Hegel. And he used to talk about Hume and Berkeley... which are rotten names, no more of any significance -- part of history, part of\nfootnotes.\nThis is the problem. You ask me, Narayana:\nWHY IS THE NEW GENERATION SUCH A PROBLEM TO THE PARENTS?\nThey are not really a problem: your expectation that they should respect you, that they should respect you as children have always respected their parents -- it is impossible. You start respecting them. You start respecting the new. Age in itself cannot now be any reason for respect. Intelligence, consciousness, they should be respected. And if you respect your children, they will respect you. But only if you respect your children will they respect you. The old way was that you go on humiliating the children, you go on insulting them in every possible way, and they have to respect you -- now this cannot be so any more.\nThe preacher's wife, while shopping, noticed a sign in the butcher's shop: \"Dam Ham on Sale.\" Slightly taken aback by such a name, she confronted the butcher about the use of profanity, but was reassured when he explained that this was a new breed of hogs being raised up by Hoover Dam, hence the name 'Dam Ham'. She decided to take some home and fix it for her family that evening.\nWhen her husband arrived home, she was cooking and he asked, \"What's for dinner? '\n\"Dam ham,\" she replied.\nThe minister, who had never heard such language in his house, began to reproach her, but after she explained he felt a little embarrassed for doubting his wife.\nThat evening as they sat down to dinner with their six-year-old son, the minister said grace and then asked, \"Pass the dam ham, please.\"\nThe little kid looked up, his eyes got big, and he said, \"Now you are talking, Dad. Pass the fucking potatoes too!\"\nThe Fish in the Sea is Not Thirsty Chapter #12\nChapter title: Who Am I?\n22 April 1979 am in Buddha Hall Archive\ncode:\n7904220\nShortTitle:\nFISH12\nAudio:\nYes Video: No Length:\n102\nmins\nThe first question Question 1\nHOW TO SACRIFICE THE EGO?\nDeva Ahuti,\nIT IS IMPOSSIBLE. THE EGO CANNOT BE SACRIFICED because the ego\nexists not.\nThe ego is just all idea: it has no substance in it. It is not something -- it is just pure nothing. You give it reality by believing in it. You can withdraw belief and the reality disappears, evaporates.\nThe ego is a kind of absence. Because you don't know yourself, hence the ego. The moment you know yourself, no ego is found. The ego is like darkness; darkness has no positive existence of its own; it ii simply the absence of light. You cannot fight with darkness, or can you? You cannot throw darkness out of the room; you cannot take it out, you cannot take it in. You cannot do anything with darkness directly. If you want to do anything with darkness, you will have to do something with light. If you put the light on, there is no darkness; if you put the light off, there is darkness.\nDarkness is only the absence of light -- so is ego: absence of self-knowledge. You cannot sacrifice it.\nIt has been told to you again and again: \"Sacrifice your ego\" -- and the statement is patently absurd, because something that does not exist cannot be sacrificed. And if you try to sacrifice it, something which is not there in the first place at all, you will be creating a new ego -- the ego of the humble, the ego of the egoless, the ego of the person who thinks he has sacrificed his ego. It will be a new kind of darkness again.\nNo, I don't say to you: Sacrifice the ego. On the contrary, I say: Try to see where the ego is. Look DEEP into it; try to locate it, where it exists, whether it exists at all or not.\nBefore one can sacrifice anything one must be certain about its existence.\nBut don't be against it from the very beginning. If you are against it, you cannot look deep into it. There is no need to be against anything. The ego is your experience -- maybe it is just apparent, but it is still your experience. Your whole life moves around the phenomenon of the ego. It may be a dream.\nBut to you it is so true.\nThere is no need to be against it. Dive deep into it, go into it. Going into it means bringing awareness into your house, bringing light into darkness. Be alert, watchful.\nWatch the ways of the ego, how it functions, how it manages at all. And you will be surprised: the deeper you go into it, the less it is found. And when you have penetrated to the very core of your being, you will find something totally different which is not ego, which is egolessness. It is self, supreme self -- it is\nGod. You have disappeared as a separate entity; you are no more an island, now you are part of the whole.\nIn that experience of being one with the whole, the ego IS sacrificed, but that is only a way of speaking, a metaphor. Don't take it literally.\nTry to understand the ego. Analyse it, dissect it, watch it, observe it, from as many angles as possible. And don't be in a hurry to sacrifice it, otherwise the greatest egoist is born: the person who thinks he is humble, the person who thinks that he has no ego.\nThat is again the same story played on a more subtle level. That's what the religious people have been doing down the ages: pious egoists they have been. They have made their ego even more decorated; it has taken the colour of religion and holiness. Your ego is better than the ego of a saint; your ego is better, far better -- because your ego is very gross, and the gross ego can be understood and dropped more easily than the subtle. The subtle ego goes on playing such games that it is very difficult. One will need absolute awareness to watch it.\nThe ego of the sinner is more easily dropped than the ego of the saint. And the saint can always manage to pretend. And his ego is so polished, so decorated, so holy, so sanctified by tradition, by convention, by the crowd, that he may almost forget about it.\nThe real search is not to make your ego humble; that is ego standing upside- down, ego doing SHIRSHASAN -- headstand. Avoid it. Rather, follow a totally different path: meditate on the phenomenon of ego, enquire what it is. And as the enquiry deepens, the ego disappears. Enquiring into the ego you will come to the self.\nAnd remember: the self has nothing to do with the ego, because the self has nothing to do with you at all. The self is always the supreme self: AHAM BRAHMASMI! -- I am God!\nAt that point, you are not, only God is: Tat-tvam-asi -- thou art that. At that point, there is no distinction between thou and that. The dewdrop has disappeared into the ocean and has become the ocean itself.\nBut no sacrifice -- the non-substantial cannot be sacrificed, it can only be\nunderstood.\nAnd in the very understanding is the disappearing. And this disappearance is beautiful, because it does not leave any traces behind, no scars, no wounds.\nThe second question Question 2\nOSHO, WHAT IS RATIONALIZATION? I AM ASKING THIS QUESTION\nBECAUSE MY HUSBAND IS A PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY AND\nWHATSOEVER I SAY HE ALMOST ALWAYS SAYS IT IS NOTHING BUT A RATIONALIZATION.\nMalti,\nRATIONALIZATION IS A TRICK OF THE MIND to deceive not only others but yourself too. Your husband may be practising rationalization himself. Whenever he says to you, \"This is a rationalization,\" it may be nothing but a rationalization on his part. He wants to avoid, he wants to escape; he does not want to answer directly. He condemns you.\nAnd of course he uses a big, very big word: rationalization. And naturally the wife is cowed down -- there must be something wrong. And the husband knows, and he is a professor of philosophy, so he is bound to know. He is practising rationalization himself.\nRationalization is not true reasoning; it is a strategy, a pretension. It pretends to be rational but it is not.\n\"Why do you drink?\" asked Hogan.\n\"Booze killed me mother,\" answered Kehoe, \"and booze killed me father -- I am drinking for revenge!\"\nThis is a rationalization. If you want to drink, drink! But this is a very subtle way of deceiving yourself and others.\nFrom a diary of an Italian girl on a Caribbean cruise:\nMonday -- was invited to dine at the Captain's table. Tuesday -- spent the day with the Captain.\nWednesday -- Captain made ungentlemanly proposals to me.\nThursday -- Captain said he would sink the ship if I did not agree to his proposals.\nFriday -- saved five hundred lives.\nThis is rationalization. Man is very cunning; man's cunningness is unlimited. And people go on doing things in the name of reason.\nToday Acharya Vinoba Bhave is going to start his fast unto death -- because he wants a total ban on cow slaughter. He calls it his religious duty. How can this be a religious duty? This is blackmail; this is threatening the country. And from where has he got the idea? He says that his mother appeared in his dream and told him, \"This is the work that you have to do.\"\nNow, for his dream, and a mother of the dream, he is threatening the country: \"I will commit suicide if you don't listen to me.\" But rather than saying it directly, \"I will commit suicide,\" he says he will fast unto death.\nAnd these people are thought to be saintly, and these people are thought to be great preachers of non-violence. That's exactly what his master, Mahatma Gandhi, did his whole life; now he is perpetuating the rotten tradition. For these thirty years at least, India has suffered from these people -- and there seems to be no end to it.\nThis is called non-violence. If I threaten somebody that \"I will kill you if you don't listen to me,\" I will be caught by the police. I will be a criminal against the law. But if I threaten that \"I will kill myself if you don't listen to me,\" this is thought to be some holy act.\nThis is strange that nobody says, \"These people should immediately be caught and brought into the court -- because they are threatening suicide, and it is a crime against the law.\" Any attempt to commit suicide is a crime against the law.\nBut Vinoba Bhave is a saint.\nMorarji Desai went to see him to persuade him: \"Don't do it!\" because he himself has been doing it, the same thing. That's how he bas come in power: by threatening to commit suicide.\nThese are subtle ways of coercion, violence. Who is one single person to decide for the whole country? Then somebody can say, \"I will fast unto death unless everybody stops smoking -- because my mother appeared in the dream and she said, 'Son, this great work you have to do.'\"\nCoercion becomes non-violence. A threat to commit suicide becomes a beautiful thing when you call it 'fast unto death'! And rather than being caught by the police and brought before the court, the prime minister runs, the ministers are running and everybody is trying to persuade him: \"Don't go on your fast unto death.\" And nobody is saying that this is a crime!\nThese are rationalizations. One can do anything if one has a cunning and clever mind to rationalize it.\nMalti, sometimes you may be rationalizing -- watch it. But my own experience of women is that they are not great rationalizers -- men are bigger rationalizers, because women live more intuitively, more instinctively, and man lives more through the head, through reason.\nWomen don't bother much about logic. Their behaviour is more or less illogical -\n-\ninstinctive, spontaneous. They don't try to masquerade it in a logical way; they simply jump from one point to another without bothering about the Aristotelian process of logic.\nThey simply jump! Their leaps are quantum, from one point to another. You cannot see what the bridge is, how they manage to get from one point to another. Their ways are totally different from men's.\nMalti, more possibility is that your husband is rationalizing, that this is his way of putting you down. He uses philosophical jargon: rationalization. And, of course, you become afraid -- you have done something wrong. I can't think, Malti, that you can do much of a rationalization; women don't indulge in it. But\nit is better to understand, because to be with a husband who is a professor of philosophy it is better to understand what rationalization is. And now, next time, whatsoever your husband says, you simply say,\n\"This is a rationalization,' and watch what happens.\nJust the other day I was reading about a psychiatrist who was mending his car, and his boy was playing with a little girl from the neighbourhood on the balcony on the first story. And down below he was tinkering with his car.\nSuddenly the boy pushed the girl from the balcony and she fell down on the ground. The father was, of course, angry. He looked up and before he could say anything, the boy asked, \"Dad, can you tell me why I did it? You are supposed to be the psychoanalyst, psychiatrist -- tell me why I did it.\"\nNext time your husband says anything, don't be worried about it -- just say, \"This is a rationalization.\" He is using a big word; a few people are obsessed with big words. But rationalization is a subtle process; people indulge in it -- men more. I have rarely come across a woman who indulges in rationalization; except the lib women nobody indulges in rationalization. They are following all the way the footsteps of men.\nBut it is good to understand what it is, and if you indulge in it, it is better not to indulge in it. It is a camouflage. It is better to be authentic, true, rather than hiding yourself behind smoke screens.\nNow, it will be good if Vinoba Bhave simply says, \"I want to impose my will on this country,\" that will be simple. \"I am ready to die if my will is not accepted.\" But that he will not say, \"I want to impose my will on this country,\" because then he will be exposed:\n\"Who are you to impose your will? This is a democracy. You cannot impose your will.\nYou have a single vote -- a single vote equal to everybody else's vote. Nobody's vote is more valuable, so who are you?\"\nBut this is how this goes on.…\nMorarji Desai wants to impose prohibition on the country. Who are you to\nimpose such things? Then where is freedom and where is democracy? Yes, if you are against alcohol, teach, express yourself, argue, persuade... that's what democracy means. Persuade people!\nIf you are against cow slaughter, go around and persuade people not to eat cow meat. But threatening that you will commit suicide is very totalitarian dictatorial, undemocratic. It is a crime against the people, against the law, against democracy.\nBut you can hide the fact in religious terminology, you can go on doing something with a mask. And people wear masks: rationalization is one of the ways of wearing masks.\nBe true. Be authentic. There is no need to be untrue, because the more untrue you become, the farther and farther you will be from God.\nI am not worried about your husband -- I am worried about your being farther and farther away from God. If you indulge in strategies like rationalization, you will never come closer to your own inner self where God resides. Drop all false faces so that you can find your original face. And to find the original face is the greatest blessing and the greatest benediction in life.\nThe third question Question 3\nOSHO, WHEN THIS QUESTION ARISES -- WHO AM I? -- I GET VERY AFRAID.\nIS THERE SOMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT IT?\nPrem Dada,\nTHIS QUESTION MAKES EVERYBODY AFRAID. It is nothing exceptional; it is absolutely the case with everybody. Whoever wants to go deep into the question, into the quest, of \"Who am I?\" is bound to feel fear at a certain point. Why? Because there comes a point where you cross the boundary of the ego and enter into the world of egolessness.\nThat point is the point of great fear -- because it looks like death. And, in fact, it\nis a kind of death: the ego disappears.\nAnd up to now that has been your identity. Up to now that's what you have been thinking you are. And suddenly it starts evaporating. A great fear grips the heart: \"I am dying!\"\nbecause your identity is dying. You are not really dying; in fact, you are being born. It is a rebirth, it is a true birth.\nIt is like the seed dying into the soil. The seed must be feeling afraid, nervous, trembling.\nHow can the seed trust that once he is gone there will be a great tree and great flowering?\nThe seed will not be there to witness it; no seed has ever witnessed it, so how can this seed believe and trust?\nAnd the same happens with the ego: the ego cannot trust that there is anything more than itself And the ego is dying, and the ego starts breathing its last, and you become afraid.\nMany people turn back from that point, rush back out.\nThis is going to happen to every meditator. Hence, Dada, your question is significant, very significant. Every meditator has to encounter this situation, this challenge. ManY\ntimes people come to the point from where they would have entered into God, but they could not risk, they could not gather courage. They became afraid, scared; they rushed out.\nYou have to take the risk. And I tell you, from my own experience, it is not death. Yes, it is a death to the ego, but the death of the ego is the birth of the soul. You will die as a drop, but you will be born as the ocean. It is worth it. You will be dying only as a limited being, as a defined being, and you will be born as undefined, undefinable.\nYes, you will disappear, with all your neurosis, psychosis. with all your tensions, anxieties, anguishes: you will disappear with all your problems, worries; you\nwill disappear as you have known yourself up to now. But your disappearance is only a change of garments, and you will be getting closer to your reality, deeper into your reality. You will get more rooted into being.\nThat's the whole search!\nYou ask me: WHEN THIS QUESTION ARISES -- WHO AM I? -- I GET VERY\nAFRAID.\nIt is natural. It is a good sign that you are coming closer to the boundary. You may be standing exactly on the boundary; that's why whenever the question arises, immediately you become afraid. Feel blessed that you are so close to the boundary from where a totally new world and a totally new life can have a start. Just one single step... and you will be a new man, and you will be an original man. Just a single step, and all the garbage that the society has dumped on you will have dropped, and you will be just a pure consciousness. You will have wings! Now you are just crawling on the earth... and then you will be able to soar high towards the sun.\nTo be with a Master simply means to learn trust, to learn the art of risking, to learn the ways of adventuring into the unknown. Yes, the sea is uncharted, and it is dangerous to leave the shore, but it is only the people who leave the shore who taste something of immortality. It is only the people who take the risk of going into danger who really live; others only pass through life, but they really don't live. Others only vegetate; others only move through empty gestures.\nSo now this is a very decisive moment for you. You can go back, you can cling to your identity, or you can go ahead, not looking hack at all. Be courageous! I can only say this much: that the same has happened to me, the same fear -- it is human. I had also gone back and forth. To cross this line is really difficult. But sooner or later, one decides --\nbecause going and coming back does not help. And once you have come so close to the line, you cannot be satisfied with your ordinary life any more. So you can go out, but there you will find everything has become meaningless. Now you will be in a dilemma.\nAnd this is the work of a Master: to create the dilemma. The without becomes\nmeaningless, and the within seems to be dangerous. To live the ordinary life again becomes impossible, and to take the jump into the new also seems impossible. But sooner or later, one decides to take the jump -- because what is the point of clinging to something that has become meaningless, which has lost all significance! How long can you cling to it?\nThe Master waits, the Master remains patient. He allows you to go back and forth, he goes on watching that you are shunting in and out. But he knows one thing: that every day the outer will go on losing its significance more and more. One day it will be utterly useless, absurd, to be there. And as the outer loses significance, the inner will become more and more magnetic -- simultaneously the process happens.\nAnd one day it becomes irresistible -- one has to cross the line. And that day is the greatest day in a human being's life, when you drop your old identity and enter into the unknown -- you have encountered God, you have come home.\nThe fourth question Question 4\nOSHO, I ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT AN AMERICAN, A CHINESE, AN AFRICAN, A SWEDE, AN INDIAN, COULD BE HAPPY AND CONTENT AND\nCOMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER DESPITE THEIR VARYING COLOURS, HABITS, BELIEFS, ETCETERA, JUST AS LONG AS THEY WERE NATURAL AND\nHONEST WITH THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER. WHY IS MANKIND MAKING\nTHIS IMPOSSIBLE FOR MANKIND?\nDarius M. Mody,\nIT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE BELIEFS and still live in peace. The belief is the root cause of all conflict. Only a world of agnostic seekers can be one. Believers cannot allow the world to be one.\nFor example, the Christian believes that it is only through Christ that salvation is possible\n-- now, how is a Mohammedan going to tolerate it? The very idea is a danger for him. He believes that only through Mohammed is true salvation possible. And how can this be tolerated by the Buddhist who thinks that except for Buddha there has never been another enlightened person? Buddha and Mahavira lived together, they were contemporaries, but Buddhists don't think that Mahavira is enlightened; neither do Jainas, the followers of Mahavira, think that Buddha is enlightened. Now, how is a Jaina going to believe that Jesus is enlightened? -- because he is not a vegetarian, he is a non-vegetarian. How can a non-vegetarian become enlightened? The belief of the Jaina is that one who becomes enlightened is bound to be vegetarian. How can he kill? His belief is going to become a barrier.\nAnd ask the Christian -- he cannot believe in Mahavira because he never helped the poor.\nJust standing under a tree naked, meditating with closed eyes, looks very selfish to the Christian. Mahavira should have opened at least a few hospitals, schools; he never did anything. He did not do any miracles either -- giving eyes to the blind, raising dead people back to life. What kind of enlightened person is he? No miracle, no service to humanity -- only talks about non-violence, but no compassion in his acts, in deed. The Christian cannot believe that Buddha is enlightened. What service has he done for humanity...?\nNow, these differing beliefs divide people. Belief is the way of division. Humanity can be one only when people drop beliefs. And that's what I am trying to do here. Be an enquirer, don't be a believer. Enquire into truth, but don't start with a prejudice -- don't start as a Christian or a Mohammedan or a Hindu.\nDarius, you say: I ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT AN AMERICAN, A CHINESE, AN\nAFRICAN, A SWEDE, AN ITALIAN, ALL COULD BE HAPPY AND CONTENT\nAND COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER DESPITE THEIR VARYING COLOURS, HABITS, BELIEFS, ETCETERA, JUST AS LONG AS THEY\nWERE\nNATURAL AND HONEST WITH THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER.\nThe American believes in the American way of life, and the Indian believes in the Indian way of life -- the conflict is there. And the Indian believes that India is the only holy country in the world, the only religious country in the world. American. The very word smells of materialism. To the Indian mind, the word 'American' means something absolutely irreligious, unholy. The American represents to him the man of indulgence.\nAnd to the American the Indian symbolizes snobbery, hypocrisy, egoism. How can these people meet? The American has to drop his being American, and the Indian has to drop his being Indian. We have to start thinking in terms of the whole earth. Religious beliefs, political beliefs, beliefs of all kinds, divide people. And, hence, all beliefs are dangerous, poisonous.\nYou can see here, Darius, people of all races, all countries, all religions, meeting\n-- with NO problem. And never is it being told to them: \"Be tolerant of others\" -- because the very idea of being tolerant carries intolerance in it. Why should it be told to somebody:\n\"Be tolerant of others\"? It simply means that there is intolerance and one has to learn to tolerate.\nIt is never told here to anybody that Hinduism and Christianity and Islam all mean the same thing; to say so means that you are suspicious. Mahatma Gandhi used to say that the Koran and the Gita and the Dhammapada, they all mean the same thing. And with great effort he used to try to find similarities -- why bother? The very effort shows that there is suspicion. And the effort cannot succeed, because they are not similar. The Koran has its own beauty and the Gita has its own beauty, and they are not similar, not at all.\nTrying to impose similarity on such unique, original scriptures is really sickening. How can Mahavira and Krishna have the same message? It is not. Just think if Arjuna had told Mahavira, \"I want to renounce the world and the war and I want to go to the forest\" --\nMahavira would have immediately initiated him into renunciation. He would have said,\n\"That's what you should have done. It is already late; but, still, good. War is violence, and it is good that an insight is born in you -- renounce the world and go to the forest.\"\nBut Krishna persuaded him not to go to the forest: \"Fight the war because this is your duty. And your very being is such that you can only be a warrior; your type is such.\nRenunciation won't suit you, it won't fit you. You will be a misfit, and even in the forest you will start hunting; you will not be able to meditate, you will hunt. I know you well, I know you from your very childhood. And all this nonsense that you are talking about is nothing but a rationalization. You are not against war!\" And he was not -- Krishna was right, his insight was deep -- he was not against war. He was really against killing his own people.\nThe war was a family war between brothers, and on both the sides were relatives.\nBecause the fight was between cousin-brothers, all the relatives had to divide -- a few had gone to this side, a few to that side. One brother was on this side, another brother was on that side. Even Krishna himself had divided; his army was fighting on the other side and he himself was fighting with Arjuna, because both were his friends and both had asked his help. So he had said, \"You can choose: one can take my army and one can take me.\"\nArjuna's own teacher from whom he had learnt all that he knew about war, who had made him a perfect warrior, Drona, he was on the other side -- his own master, from whom he had learnt archery, he was fighting on the other side. It was really a family war. And Arjuna was not against war: he was against killing one's own people. Seeing the whole war-field full of his own people -- a few on this side, a few on that side -- and both would be killed and many would be killed -- he started thinking, \"What is the point of it all?\nKilling my own family! It is better I should renounce.\"\nHe was not against violence. If his own people had not been involved, he would have enjoyed the war like anything. Krishna persuaded him to see the fact that he was rationalizing; all this nonsense talk about non-violence, no war, peace, renunciation, was just a rationalization. He forced him to see the trick of his mind.\nNow, how can you say Mahavira and Krishna are saying the same thing? They are not saying the same thing.\nMy own experience is this, that all those who have become enlightened in the world --\nand Moses is enlightened, and Zarathustra is enlightened, and Lao Tzu is enlightened and Mohammed and Jesus and Krishna, Buddha, Mahavira, Kabir, and many many more --\nwhat they have experienced is the same. But still their personalities are so different, their individuality is so unique, that their expressions are utterly different and you cannot force by ally strategy to make it appear that they are saying the same thing -- they are not.\nTheir experience is the same, their ultimate experience is the same, but their choice of how life should be lived, how that ultimate experience should be approached, is totally different. Their paths are different, their goal may be the same -- but the goal will be known only when you have arrived, not before that. Before the goal you will have to follow the path.\nMAHATMA GANDHI WAS TRYING somehow to prove that the Mohammedan and the Hindu and the Jaina are all saying the same thing. It was a forgery, because he was choosing from the Koran only sentences which are harmonious with the Gita, and not choosing sentences which are disharmonious with the Gita. The Gita is his criterion. He calls the Gita his mother, but he does not call the Koran his father. The Gita is his mother; he remains a Hindu, basically a Hindu. And according to the Gita he goes on finding...\nwherever anything can be found which is similar, he chooses it, picks it up; but anything that is not similar to the Gita, he simply drops it, he forgets all about it.\nThis is not a right approach. And still he could not convince anybody. In fact, the very effort was futile, an exercise in futility -- he could not convince the Mohammedans, he could not convince the Hindus. Mohammedans remained Unconvinced; they continued demanding a separate country, and they succeeded in having a separate country. And he could not convince the Hindus -- in fact, one Hindu murdered him, one fanatic Hindu murdered him. He could not convince anybody.\nAnd I cannot believe that he convinced himself either. His whole life he was singing in his ashram: \"ALLAH-ISHWAR TERI nam -- Allah and Ishwar, both are thy names!\" But when he was shot dead, Allah didn't come to his heart. When the bullet passed into his heart, he cried, \"Ram!\" not Allah -- \"Hey Ram!\" That is very decisive. At that moment all philo-sophizing was forgotten, the real Hindu surfaced. He could not remember Allah at that moment, could not remember Buddha, could not remember Mahavira. The person he remembered was Ram -- the Hindu ideal, the Hindu incarnation of God. That shows that he could not even convince himself -- what to say of others?\nIn this place I am not trying to convince anybody, and still things are happening. I am not trying to bring a synthesis of all religions, because I know it is utterly futile. They ARE\ndifferent, they are unique. And I respect their uniqueness. In fact, the world is richer because there is a Koran and there is a Gita and there is a Dhammapada. The world is richer because Zarathustra happened, Lao Tzu happened, Buddha happened; the world is richer because there is Nanak and Kabir and Farid. So many different flowers! The world is a beautiful garden.\nAnd the rose is not the lotus, and the lotus is not the rose -- both are flowers, both have bloomed, that is true. Buddha has bloomed and Jesus has bloomed -- both are flowers --\nbut a rose is a rose and a lotus is a lotus. And it is good that not all are roses, that not all are lotuses.\nBut something very mysterious is happening here, Darius, you can see: all kinds of people are here, from almost every country, from every religion, and nobody teaches them to be tolerant and nobody teaches them to be respectful of the other's religion.\nThese things are simply not talked about, and still nobody is intolerant. In fact, nobody thinks in terms that the other is other. This is a totally different vision.\nMy approach is that you have to drop -- not to imbibe tolerance, not to imbibe a certain synthesis, manipulated, man-made -- you have to drop this whole nonsense of the American way of life and the Indian way of life and the Chinese way of life. You have to drop this whole nonsense that \"I am a Hindu, Mohammedan, Parsi, Sikh.\" You are just a human being! Maybe your colour is\ndifferent -- so what? It is good that there are people of different colours, different flowers. Your hair is different -- good! It makes life more worth living, more interesting. The variety gives richness.\nYour idea, Darius, that people can live in harmony even though they have different beliefs is wrong. Those different beliefs are the problem. In fact, to believe is to go wrong: knowing is good, believing is wrong. Enquiring is good, gathering prejudice is wrong. Be a seeker and be an agnostic.\nBy 'agnostic' is meant: say clearly to others and to yourself that \"I don't know -- so how can I cling to any belief? I was born in a Hindu family, so I have been taught the Hindu religion by my parents, but I don't know what is right and what is wrong -- it is just incidental. Had I been brought up by a Christian, I would have believed in the Christian religion in the same way. Or, if I had been born in Soviet Russia then I would have been a communist; then I would not have believed in the trinity of God the Father and God the Son and the Holy Ghost. I would have believed in a totally different trinity: Marx, Engels, Lenin, and the Kremlin would have been my Kaaba, and DAS KAPITAL would have been my Bhagavad Gita.\"\nJust see -- it is simple! Nobody is born a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Christian\n-- these things are imposed on you. This is ugly that these things are imposed on you. In a really free world no religion will be imposed on anybody. All religions will be available to everybody! One should be free to shop around. One can go to the temple, to the mosque, to the gurudwara, and one can move around, do a little religious shopping; one can look into the Koran and the Bible and the Vedas, and decide on one's own.\nParents should not decide the religion of their children. It should be a crime against humanity to force any child into any religion. Yes, parents should teach the child to enquire and how to enquire. They should make available to him all alternatives, so if the child wants one day to become a Mohammedan, you may be a Hindu but if your child wants to become a Mohammedan, it is perfectly good. You should be happy your child has chosen a religion. It is good that he is becoming religious. How does it matter where he will pray? -- in the temple or in the mosque. The only thing that matters is that he will pray.\nBut now, right now, that is not the case. Nobody is interested in prayer: everybody is interested -- where? Nobody is interested in making you really\nreligious; everybody is interested in making you a Christian, Catholic, Protestant, this and that. This is an ugly situation -- and that divides people.\nWe have to fight for a world where children will not be forced into any religion. And every child should be given all opportunities to choose. Who knows what is going to fit him? My own observation is that it happens that a man is born in a Jaina family, but he is not that type -- he is not the type of Mahavira. Then his whole life he will be doing something for which he is not meant. He will follow Mahavira, but his heart will not be in it. His heart can go far more deeply with Meera, with Krishna -- but that is not possible, he is a Jaina. And vice versa: a man may be born into a family which worships Krishna but seeing Krishna no bells ring in his heart. Then what is he supposed to do?\nPretend? Be a hypocrite? Go on believing because his parents are Hindus so he has to remain a Hindu? Seeing the statue of Mahavira naked, silent, his heart may be stirred, he may feel a new fluttering in his being, a new energy, a new flash of lightning. It may click! Then that is his religion.\nReligion has to be found by your own heart. All religions are good. All religions are different. All religions are ways: They reach the same goal. But nobody can follow all the ways. If you follow all the ways you will go crazy. You have to follow one way, knowing perfectly well that all the ways are leading to the same peak of the mountain. Still one has to follow one way.\nBut if the beginning is not a belief but enquiry, the world will be totally different. Darius, with beliefs it is not possible. Habits are okay; habits are going to be different.\nIn the Indian atmosphere there will be different habits. But habits are not a big problem; you can understand that in a cold country there will be different habits than in a hot country. That is very natural. But beliefs have nothing to do with cold or hot, beliefs have nothing to do with climate. Beliefs have nothing to do with nature: beliefs are man-made.\nBeliefs are all basically political, tactics, strategy, to manipulate the crowds, to control the crowds.\nYou ask: WHY IS MANKIND MAKING THIS IMPOSSIBLE FOR MANKIND?\nBECAUSE MAN IS NOT YET BORN: mankind exists only in theory. Once a man said to George Bernard Shaw. \"What do you think of civilization?\" He said, \"It is a good idea, but somebody has to try it.\"\nMankind is also a good idea -- but somebody has to try it. It has not yet happened.\nHumanity has not yet arrived. Hindus are there, Mohammedans are there, Christians are there, Indians and Germans and Italians are there, but humanity has not yet arrived. It is a simple word, but empty, with no substance.\nIf somebody asks you, \"Darius, who are you?\" it is almost impossible to conceive that you will say, \"A human being.\" You will say, \"A Christian, a Hindu, a Parsi, a Mohammedan.…\" You may say, \"A doctor, an engineer, a professor, a scientist...\" so on and so forth, ad nauseam, but almost impossible to comprehend, even to imagine that you will say, \"A human being.\"\nAnd if you say it, the other person who is asking will feel that you are a little crazy or something. \"Yes, of course, you are a human being! But I am asking: who are you?\"\nHumanity has yet to happen, and we have to prepare the ground for humanity to happen.\nIt can happen only by dropping ALL kinds of beliefs. It can happen only by creating a great upsurge of enquiry, creating an atmosphere, a space, in which belief simply means that you are ignorant -- you don't know, still you are trying to pretend that you know.\nBelief is not knowing but a deception.\nA real man does not believe. Either he knows or he does not know. If somebody asks you, \"Does God exist?\" if you are honest, sincere, you cannot say, \"I believe in God, I believe that he exists.\" And you cannot say, \"I don't believe in God, and I say that he does not exist.\" No. If you are a sincere man, if you have any respect for truth, you will say, \"I don't know. I am searching, seeking. I am neither a believer nor a non-believer. I am a seeker, a searcher.\"\nAnd the day you know, do you think you will believe then? Then there will be no need to believe. You don't believe in the sun! You don't see people fighting\nthat the sun exists, that the sun does not exist, that the sun rises in the east or the sun rises in the west, south, north -- you don't see people fighting. Everybody knows the sun rises in the east, and everybody knows that the sun IS -- there IS no question of belief.\nIf you ask me, \"Do you believe in God?\" I will say, \"No, because I know God is. I need not believe.\" Knowing is the real thing; belief is just a camouflage, a cover-up.\nHelp people to drop beliefs. Help people to become enquirers. Help people to start functioning from not knowing. And that is the state of meditation: to function from a state of not knowing is to function meditatively. To function from the state of knowledge is to miss the whole point. Knowledge is always old and life is never old. Knowledge and life never meet.\nHence I am using the word 'knowing' deliberately, instead of 'knowledge'. 'Knowledge' is a noun, 'knowing' is a verb. Knowing is a flow, knowledge is static. Knowledge has a full point, knowing has no full point -- it is simply an ongoing process. One never knows God in the sense of knowledge; one only knows God in the sense of knowing. Yes, there is a beginning, but then there is no end. One goes on knowing more and more and more, and the more one knows, the more one feels there is more to knower.\nYou say, Darius: I ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT JUST AS LONG AS THEY WERE\nNATURAL AND HONEST WITH THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER, THEY\nCOULD ALL BE HAPPY AND CONTENT AND COMMUNICATE WITH EACH\nOTHER DESPITE THEIR VARYING COLOURS, HABITS, BELIEFS, ETCETERA.\nBut how can people be natural and honest when they are carrying so many beliefs? To be natural means to be without any belief Children are natural, but you are not natural.\nAnimals are natural, but you are not natural. Trees are natural, but you are not\nnatural.\nAnd what has made you unnatural and artificial? Your belief system.\nBut it is very difficult to drop the belief system. And how can you be honest if you believe? It is a contradiction in terms, to be honest and to believe. If somebody says, \"I believe in God,\" he is saying, \"I don't know -- I have heard, I have been taught, I have been told. I believe in God; I don't know myself \" How can he be honest? This is the beginning of dishonesty. Not knowing himself, and still believing, what more dishonesty can there be?\nParents teach their children, \"Believe in God and be honest.\" This is such a contradiction in terms: \"Believe in God and be honest!\" Only one is possible: either you can believe in God, then you cannot be honest; or you can be honest, then you have to say clearly and loudly, \"I cannot believe in God, because I don't know.\"\nBut this is a double bind that is being created in every person. You are taught contradictory things -- hence your schizophrenic state. You are taught such contradictory things that you remain split. And you have been taught so long that you don't see the contradiction either. The so-called religious person -- Christian, Mohammedan, Hindu --\nhe cannot be honest. If he is honest, he cannot be Christian, Hindu or Mohammedan.\nHow can you be honest and still believe that Christ was born of a virgin mother? Just tell me -- how can you be honest and still believe it? How can you be honest? Deep down you know it is not possible. Children are not born of virgin mothers.\nHow can you be honest and still believe that when a snake attacked Mahavira, instead of blood, milk flowed from his foot? How can you believe it -- and still be honest? There is only one possibility, that in Mahavira's body instead of blood milk was circulating. But to keep milk circulating for so long -- he must have been nearabout fifty when this snake attacked him -- milk would have turned into curd long before.\nAnd curd cannot flow. Mahavira would have been dead long before. How can you be honest and still believe in this? If you are honest, questions will arise.\nAnd if you believe, you have to be dishonest -- you have to repress your questions.\nMan can be natural and honest, but then beliefs have to be dropped -- all kinds of beliefs have to be dropped. And dropping the beliefs, your energy is freed, and that same energy becomes enquiry, and that same energy can take you to the ultimate truth.\nPeople are so religious, so fanatically religious, that I have heard:\n\"Is your grandfather a religious man?\" asked the young coed of her date.\n\"He is so Orthodox,\" replied the boy, \" when he plays chess, he doesn't use bishops -- he uses rabbis.\"\nThe last question Question 5\nOSHO, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE STATEMENT THAT LIFE IS STRANGER THAN FICTION?\nNandan,\nIT CAN'T BE OTHERWISE, because fiction is only a reflection of life, only an echo, a faraway echo. How can fiction be more strange than life? It is just a shadow of life, footprints of life. Life is really unbelievable, incredible. It should not be, and it is. It is utterly mysterious.\nBut you become aware of the strangeness of a fictitious story and you never become aware of the strangeness of life, because you take it for granted. You take it for granted as the fish takes the ocean for granted -- and it never becomes aware of it. How can the fish be aware of the ocean? It was born in the ocean, it has lived in the ocean; from the very beginning the ocean was there. Just as you are not aware of the air and the weight of the air, you are not aware of the gravitation and the pull of the gravitation, in the same way, the fish is not aware of the ocean, and in the same way you are not aware of the incredible life that surrounds you within and without -- you take it for granted, and that's what makes you miserable.\nStop taking life for granted, and immediately you are constantly in awe. Each moment becomes a surprise, each moment becomes such a revelation of mystery, and life takes a totally different colour and flavour. You grow wings. Then you are no more bored, then you are no more dull. Then life is excitement, exhilaration, ecstasy.\nAnd that's what, basically, true religion is: to make you aware of the life, to make you alert to all that is happening around you -- the sun, the moon, the stars, the rivers, the mountains, the people... this silence this moment... your being here, my being here... what more mystery can there be than this communion? Your hearts beating with my heart, your life energy in rhythm with my life energy... for this single moment, three thousand people in harmony, in such an utter silence, as if there exists nobody... this melting, this merging... what more mystery can there be? What more miracles?\nJust to be is a miracle! Just to be able to breathe is a miracle! Just to be able to see the light and the rainbow and the starry night -- what more can you ask for? What more can you imagine?\nYou ask me: OSHO, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE STATEMENT THAT\nLIFE IS STRANGER THAN FICTION?\nI don't think! -- it is. There is no need to think -- I know -- it is, it is so. Thinking is a lower activity, seeing is a higher activity. I see it is so -- it is not a logical conclusion for me, it is my existential experience. I am constantly surprised -- each moment, every breath is a surprise. And this is not a statement, this is the truth! Just become a little more alert, a little more aware, a little more observant. Snap your fingers and slap your face and be awake! And then look around... and the silence, and the beauty and the benediction.\nIt is said that Hotei became enlightened and started laughing, and then he never stopped laughing. For many years he lived, he laughed. He laughed all the way to God, all the way to death. And people would ask, \"Hotei, why do you laugh?\" because he became famous in Japan as the laughing Buddha. And he would say, \"Because life is incredible, so ridiculous, so absurd.\" It should not be, but it is! For no reason at all flowers go on blooming and birds go on singing, and every morning the sun is back. For NO reason! If it doesn't turn up one day, what can\nwe do? For no reason at all!\nAnd all exists in such harmony, accord, in such rhythm, that if you touch a grass leaf, you have touched the whole universe -- because the small grass leaf contains the whole of the universe. It will not be there without the sun, it will not be there without the earth, it will not be there without the planets and the stars. It will not be there if this universe is not exactly the way it is. And if that grass leaf is gone, the universe will be a little less, a little minus; it will miss it. Such an infinity, and it goes on with such rhythmic flow, with such organic oneness, with such orgasmic joy.\nJust watch life... and you will be able to laugh. It IS absurd, it IS ridiculous, it IS strange, it is miraculous. No dream can be more dreamlike than life, and no poetry can be more poetic than life -- and no joke can create more laughter than life.\nA couple of hillbillies from the backwoods country came into town to get married and brought their best man, Zeke, along. When they applied for a license, the clerk informed them that state law required blood tests before they could get a license, and told them there was a doctor around the corner who would make the tests.\nAs the M.D. took blood samples from the prospective bride and groom, Zeke watched with great interest. \"What are you doing, Doc?\" he asked.\n\"We check for venereal disease,\" said the physician. \"If we find any, the wedding can't take place until it is cured.\"\n\"Well then,\" said the best man, \"ain't you gonna test my blood?\" \"What for?\" asked the doctor. \"You are not getting married are you?\"\n\"Oh, no,\" said Zeke, as he pointed to the couple, \"but I am gonna board with them!\"\n... You missed it...! You will need another.\nPayne and Butler were washing their hands in a Pittsburgh men's room when three burly blacks came in and headed for the urinals.\n\"Wow!\" whispered Payne, \"those mothers are laa-arge!\"\n\"Yeah,\" said Butler, \"and look how they are built. They must have the longest dicks in the state of Pennsylvania. I gotta get closer and see their size!\"\nHe came back in a minute. \"Wowee! They are built big,\" said Payne, \"not only that, the cat in the middle has one that is white!\"\n\"Oh, man, whoever heard of a black man with a white wang!

Man is not one\nsingle being: man is the past and the future. The past means the animal, and the future means the divine. And between the two is the present moment, between\nthe two is man's existence --\ndivided, torn apart, pulled in diametrically opposite directions.\nIf man looks backwards he is an animal. That's why science cannot believe that man is anything more -- just another animal -- because science only searches into the past.\nCharles Darwin and others, they are right that man is born of the animals. It is true about the past, but it is not true about man's totality.\nReligion looks into the possible, into that which can happen and has not yet happened.\nScience dissects the seed and cannot find any flowers there. Religion is visionary, it dreams -- and is capable of seeing that which has not happened yet: the flower. Of course, it cannot be found, that flower cannot be found, by dissecting the seed. It needs great insight, not capacity to analyse, but some intuitive flight, some vision, some poetic approach. It needs a real dreamer who can see that which has not happened yet.\nReligion looks into the possible and finds man is not an animal, but divine: man is God --\nboth are true. The conflict is baseless. The conflict between science and religion is futile.\nTheir directions, their methods of work, their fields, are totally different.\nScience always reduces everything to the source, and religion always takes a flight to the goal. Man is both, hence man is a dilemma, a constant anxiety: to be or not to be, to be this or to be that?\nMan can find peace only in two ways: either he becomes an animal again -- then he will be one, then there will be no division, then again there will be peace, silence, harmony.…\nAnd that's why millions of people try to be animals in different ways.\nWar gives a chance for man to become animal; hence war has great attraction. In\nthree thousand years' history man has fought five thousand wars -- continuously, somewhere or other, the war continues. Not even a single day passes when man is not killing other men.\nWhy such tremendous joy in destruction, in killing? The reason is deep down in the psychology of man.\nThe moment you kill, suddenly you are one; you become the animal again, the duality disappears. Hence, in murder, in suicide, there is a tremendous magnetic force. Man cannot be persuaded yet to be non-violent. Violence erupts. Names change, slogans change, but the violence remains the same. It may be in the name of religion, in the name of political ideology, or any absurd thing -- a football match is enough for people to get violent, a cricket match is enough.\nPeople are so much interested in violence that if they cannot do it themselves -- because it is risky and they think of the consequences -- they find vicarious ways to be violent. In a movie, or on the TV, violence is a must; without violence, nobody is going to see the film. Seeing violence and blood, suddenly you are reminded of your animal past; you forget your present, you completely forget your future -- you become your past. You become identified; what is happening on the screen somehow becomes your own life.\nYou are no more a spectator -- in those moments you become a participant, you fall en rapport.\nViolence has great attraction. Sexuality has great attraction, because it is only in sexual moments that you can become one; otherwise you remain two, divided, and the anxiety and the anguish persist. Violence, sex, drugs, they all help you, at Least for the time being, temporarily, to fall back, to become all animal. But this cannot become a permanent state of affairs.\nOne fundamental law has to be understood: nothing can go backwards. At the most you can pretend, at the most you can deceive, but nothing can go backwards because time docs not move backwards. Time always goes ahead. You cannot reduce a young man to a child, and you cannot reduce an old man to a young man -- it is impossible. The tree cannot be reduced back to the original seed -- it is impossible.\nEvolution goes on and on and there is no way to prevent it or to force it backwards.\nHence all efforts of men to become animals and find peace are doomed to fail. You can be drunk through alcohol or through other drugs -- marijuana, LSD -- you can be completely drowned. For the moment all the worries disappear, for the moment you are no more part of a problematic existence, for the moment you move in a totally different dimension -- but for the moment only.\nTomorrow morning you will be back, and when you are back the world is going to be more ugly than it ever was before, and life is going to be more of a problem than it ever was before. Because while you were intoxicated, unconscious, asleep in the drug, the problems were growing. The problems were becoming more and more complicated.\nWhile you were thinking that you had gone beyond the problems, the problems were taking root more in your being, in your unconscious.\nTomorrow again you will be back in the same world -- it will look more ugly compared to the peace that you had attained by reduction, by intoxication, by forgetfulness.\nCompared to that peace, the world will look even more dangerous, more complex, more scary. And then the only way is: go on increasing the doses of your drug. But that too does not help for long. And this is no way to get out of the dilemma. The dilemma remains, persists.\nThe only way is to grow towards the divine, the only way is forwards. The only way is to become that which is your potential -- the only way is to transform the potential into the actual.\nMAN IS POTENTIAL GOD, and unless he becomes actual God there is no possibility of contentment. People have tried that too: How to become divine? And becoming divine, what to do with the animal? The simplest solution that has appeared again and again down the ages is: repress the animal. It is the same solution; either repress the divine --\nthrough violence, through sex, through drugs -- forget about the divine. That is one solution -- which never succeeds, cannot succeed; in the very nature of things it is bound to fail. Then the second suggestion that comes to the mind is: repress the animal, forget the animal; keep the animal at the back, don't look at it. Throw it deep down in the basement of your unconscious so you don't come across it in your daily life, so you don't see it.\nMan thinks almost in the same way as the ostrich. The ostrich thinks if he cannot see the enemy, the enemy does not exist. Hence, when the ostrich encounters the enemy he simply closes his eyes. By closing his eyes he thinks now there is no enemy because he cannot see him.\nThat's what has been done down the ages by ninety-nine percent of religious people. In that one percent I leave Buddhas, Krishnas, Kabirs. Ninety-nine percent of religious people have just been doing nothing but an ostrich exercise -\n- an exercise of utter futility.\nRepress the animal! But you cannot repress the animal because the animal has great energy. It has been your whole past; it is millions and millions of years old. It has deep roots in you; you cannot so easily get rid of it, just by closing your eyes. You are simply being stupid.\nAnd the animal is your base, it is your very foundation. You are born as an animal; you are not different from any other animal. You CAN be different but you are not -- just by being born you don't become different. Yes, you have a different kind of body, but not very much different. You have a different kind of intelligence, but not very much different. The difference is only of quantity, not of quality.\nNow modern research into plants says that even plants are intelligent, sensitive, alert, aware -- what to say about animals? A few researchers say that even metals have a kind of intelligence of their own. So the difference between man and the elephant. between man and the dolphin, between man and the monkeys, is not of quality, it is only of quantity, only of degrees. We have a little bit more intelligence, that's all.\nIt is not much of a difference, at least not a difference that makes any difference. The qualitative change happens only when a man becomes fully awakened, when a man becomes a Buddha -- then the real difference happens. Then he is no more an animal.\nThen he is simply divine -- but how to attain it?\nThat ninety-nine percent of religious people has been doing something utterly wrong --\njust the same logic. The same logic that is being followed by the violent people,\nthe sexual people, the alcoholics. The same kind of logic: forget the animal. Many techniques have been developed to forget the animal: chant mantras so that you can forget the animal, become occupied in chanting; go on repeating \"Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama.\"\nRepeat it so fast that your whole mind be-comes full of the vibe of this single word\n'Rama'. This is simply a way to avoid the animal -- and the animal is there.\nYou can go on chanting Rama for centuries... the animal is not going to be changed by such a simple trick. You cannot deceive the animal. It will remain only a very superficial religiousness. Scratch any religious man and you will find the animal inside; just scratch a little. It is not even skin-deep, the so-called religiousness. It only pretends, it is only a formality, a social ritual.\nYou go to the church, you read the Bible, you read the Gita, you do chanting, you do prayer, but it is all formal. Your heart is not in it. And your animal inside goes on laughing at you, he ridicules you. He knows you perfectly well, who you are, where you are. And he knows how to manipulate you. You can go on chanting for hours, and then a beautiful woman passes by and suddenly all chanting disappears and you have forgotten all about God. Just the smell from the bakery... and all is gone; Hare Krishna Rama, all is gone.\nJust any small thing is enough! Somebody insults you and there is anger, and the animal is ready to take revenge, you are in a rage. In fact, religious people become more angry than anybody else -- because others don't repress. And religious people are more sexually perverted than anybody else, because others don't repress. The religious person's dreams have to be watched, because in the day he can go on repressing, but what about the night when he is asleep?\nMahatma Gandhi wrote that even at the age of seventy he was having sexual dreams. At the age of seventy, why sexual dreams? He said, \"In the day I have become disciplined --\nthe whole day not even a single thought of sex comes to me. But in the night I am incapable, I am unconscious, so the hole discipline and control disappears.\"\nSigmund Freud's insight is very valuable, that to know about a man you have to know his dreams, not his waking life. His waking life is pseudo. His real life\nasserts itself in his dreams, because his dreams are more natural -- no repression, no discipline, no control.\nHence, psychoanalysis does not bother about your waking life. Just see the point: your waking life is so pseudo that psychoanalysis docs not believe in it at all. It is worthless.\nPsychoanalysis penetrates into your dreams because dreams are far truer than your so-called waking life.\nThis is ironical that the waking life, which we think is real life is not thought by psychoanalysis to be real; it is thought to be more unreal than your dreams. Your dreams are far more real, because you are not there to distort, you are fast asleep; the conscious mind is asleep and the unconscious is free to have its say. And the unconscious is your true mind, because the conscious is only one tenth of your total mind. Nine tenths is the unconscious -- nine times more powerful, nine times bigger than your conscious mind.\nAnd what will you do when you are fighting with your sexuality, anger, greed? You will go on throwing them into the unconscious, into the darkness of the basement, thinking that by not seeing them you are getting rid of them. You are not getting rid of them. Not even a man like Mahatma Gandhi... what to say about small mahatmas like Morarji Desai etc.\nA man like Mahatma Gandhi continued to have sexual dreams. That simply shows that his whole effort in the waking life was futile, that whatsoever he was trying to do in the waking life was of no use. And he recognized it -- at the very end of his life he recognized the whole futility of his discipline. His whole life had been a wastage; he recognized it. And in the end, just before he died, for two years he was experimenting with the science of Tantra. It is not talked about, not at least by the Gandhians -- they are very much afraid of those two years. He was advised by his followers, \"Please, don't do such experiments.\"\nYou will be surprised: even Morarji Desai had advised him, \"Don't do such experiments!\"\nWhy? They were afraid about the prestige of the Mahatma. They were afraid about themselves too. But he was a man of courage; howsoever wrong, he was a sincere man.\nHe had the courage to accept that his effort of disciplining according to the traditional way had failed. In the last two years he was sleeping with naked women -- just for the first time not repressing but expressing, being loving, open, for the first time not on guard.\nMy own understanding is that those two years of his life which are not talked about are the most important -- not only were they not talked about: the followers deny, hide those facts. And those two years are the most important in his life. In those two years, for the first time he became aware that sexual energy need not be repressed: it can be transformed.\nHis life was cut short because a fanatic from this very city, Poona, killed him. Otherwise it would have been a totally different story. If he had lived ten more years, then all these so-called Gandhians would have left him. Many had already left when he started experimenting with Tantra. If he had lived ten more years it would have been a great boon to humanity, because he would have been able to say, \"My whole life's effort of repression failed while Tantra succeeded.\"\nNinety-nine percent of religious people go on repressing, and whenever you repress something it goes deeper in you, it becomes more a part of your being. And it starts affecting you in such subtle ways that you may not even be aware of it. It takes very devious routes: it cannot come in direct ways because if it comes directly, you Repress it.\nThen it comes in such subtle ways, such devious ways, such deceptive ways, with masks, that you cannot even recognize that it is sexuality.\nIt can even use masks of prayer, of love, of religious ritual. But if you go deep down, if you allow yourself to be exposed to somebody who can observe and who understands the inner functioning of your mind, you will be surprised that it is the same energy moving through different channels. It has to move through different channels, because no energy can ever be repressed.\nLet it be understood once and for all: no energy can ever be repressed. Energy can be transformed, but never repressed. The real religion consists of alchemy, of transforming techniques, methods. The real religion consists not of repressing the animal but of purifying the animal, of raising the animal to the divine, using the animal, riding on the animal to go to the divine. It can become a tremendously powerful vehicle, because it is power.\nSex can be used as a great energy -- you call ride on it to the very door of God. But if you repress it you will become more and more entangled. This is a very modern approach, but the sutras of Kabir will say to you that what Sigmund Freud discovered is not a discovery\n-- it is only a discovery in the West. As far as the East is concerned, it is an ancient truth.\nThe sages have always known about it.\nThese sutras are very beautiful, very scientific. Meditate over each sutra: FRIEND PLEASE TELL ME WHAT I CAN DO ABOUT\nTHIS WORLD\nI HOLD TO AND KEEP SPINNING OUT!\nThe original is:\nAVADHU, MAYA TAJI NA JAI.\nAVADHU LITERALLY MEANS A FRIEND, but it has a special meaning, not just a friend. In English there is no word to give the real meaning of AVADHU, but it can be explained. AVADHU means a friend, a companion, a comrade, on the way towards the divine -- a special kind of friendship. The friendship of two seekers, the friendship of those who are in search of the unknown and the unknowable, the friendship of those who are ready for the ultimate venture, who are ready to go into the uncharted sea. AVADHU\nmeans friends in the search for truth. It is risky; such a friendship needs guts. It is no ordinary friendship -- it is utterly extraordinary, it is not of this world.\nThis friendship means SATSANG: when many seekers gather together around a man who has known, because such a friendship is possible only around a man who has known, such a gathering is possible only around a Buddha, around one who has awakened --\nbecause he will function as the center of the commune. Without the center, the commune will not have any significance; it will be an ordinary crowd.\nWithout Christ, Christians are just a crowd, an ordinary crowd. With Christ, it is a communion, it is satsang -- it is the ultimate friendship. Christ can call his disciples AVADHU -- friends, comrades, companions, soulmates -- that's exactly the meaning of AVADHU. The friendship is not worldly, has no motive. The friendship is not that of dependence. The friendship has no relationship which can be explained in any worldly way -- but two souls in a deep rhythm, two soulmates.\nIt is difficult to search alone -- the path is arduous, hazardous. dangerous; there is every possibility of getting lost. It is easier it people move with friends. It is like Gurdjieff used to say... when he was travelling in Sufi countries, a Sufi Master gave him a technique.\nThe technique was that twenty friends of Gurdjieff had to go deep into the desert, but at least one person had to remain awake. Including Gurdjieff, there were twenty-one persons. Twenty persons could go to sleep, but one had to be awake constantly, twenty-four hours a day. When he WAS tired he had to wake somebody else; he could go to sleep, then the other had to remain awake. But one had to be awake!\nIf you are alone you will have to fall asleep once in a while, but if you are moving with friends at least one can always be awake. And in a desert, or in a forest, in a jungle, it is needed that at least one should be awake.\nAnd when you go on the journey, the ultimate pilgrimage to God, it is good to have a few friends with you, because at least one can always be awake. And the person who is awake will become your protection, and the person who is awake will help you not to go astray, and the person who is awake will keep you together, and the person who is awake will become a kind of glue which will integrate your energies.\nBut if you can find a man who is awake, twenty-four hours awake -- that's the meaning of being a Buddha -- then naturally a commune of friends gathers around him. His light, his under-standing, slowly slowly permeates their being too.\nKabir is not talking to the public -- he is talking to a few friends. Hence he says: AVADHU, FRIENDS, MAYA TAJI NA JAI.\nIt is very difficult to drop this mind -- it is very difficult to drop this mind\nbecause who is going to drop it? Even the idea of dropping is part of the mind. It is very difficult to drop the mind, because even if you drop it the one who drops it will remain -- that will become your mind. It is a very vicious circle. How to come out of it?\nThis mind is illusory, hence he calls it 'maya -- all illusion. It is NOT really there; it has no substance, but still it persists continuously -- day in, day out, your mind continues.\nThoughts, dreams, desires, imagination, memory... the traffic goes on and on. All is non-substantial! If you wake up, suddenly you will find all the dreams, all the desires, all the thoughts, have disappeared. But how to drop this mind? Who is going to drop it? If you try to drop it, you are the mind.\nYou can escape to the Himalayan caves but the mind will go with you, because really the mind will be going to the Himalayan caves -- who else? You can renounce the family, but who will renounce? You can stand on your head, but it will be the same mind -- you are simply being stupid. It has to be understood.\nNothing has to be done on your part, because anything done is done always by the mind.\nDoing is the very function of the mind. So nothing can be done with the mind to drop it.\nAVADHU, MAYA TAJI NA JAI.\nSo Kabir says: It is very difficult, friends, to drop this mind and its illusions. In the first place they are so non-substantial -- if they had been substantial it would have been easy.\nYou can Leave the house, you can renounce your wife, your children, you can go away from the world -- it is very substantial! But how will you leave your mind? It will be with you.\nWhen Bayazid, a Sufi saint, went to see his Master, he re-nounced his family, his friends, and he went to the Master. The Master used to live in the ruins of an old mosque. When Bayazid entered he said, \"Now I have come, I have renounced all\n-- please accept me.\"\nThe Master looked at Bayazid and looked around and said, \"And why have you brought this crowd with you?\"\nBayazid was surprised. He looked back -- there was nobody else. Has this man gone mad? He said, \"What crowd are you talking about?\"\nAnd the Master said, \"Don't look back -- look in. All those people that you have left behind are there.\"\nAnd Bayazid closed his eyes... and the Master was right, he was not crazy. The wife was still crying, the children were telling him, \"Daddy, don't go.\" The friends were holding his hands to the very last. When he said goodbye to them, they all followed him as far as possible; he had to persuade them again and again, \"Please go back. I have decided, and my decision is absolute.\" And when he closed his eyes they were all there.\nAnd the Master said, \"Bayazid, it is easy to renounce the world, but how are you going to renounce the mind? Because the mind is the real world! They are all there. You will sit meditating, and you will remember your wife; you may not have ever remembered her when you were with her -- that's how mind functions. That which is, it takes it for granted; that which is not it hankers for. Now you will be more and more involved with your wife, your children. More and more memories will come: 'What is happening to my children? What is happening to my wife? Has she betrayed me? Has she gone with somebody else? Can she do that?' Jealousy, possessiveness, and all kinds of things are bound to arise.\"\nThere is a beautiful story in Jaina scriptures:\nA great king, Bimbisar, went to see Mahavira, the last Jaina teerthankara -- the last Jaina prophet. On the way, he met one of his old friends. They had studied in the same school; he was also a son of a king, but he had renounced and he had become a Jaina monk -- he was standing naked underneath a tree.\nBimbisar was overwhelmed with tremendous respect for this man and started feeling a little guilty also about himself: \"I am still involved in the world -- money, power, prestige, war. And look at my friend: he was also a king, he would also have been a king like me, but he has renounced -- a man of courage.\" He bowed down, he touched the feet of his old friend. Then he went to see Mahavira.\nJust a few yards further away was Mahavira, sitting underneath a tree. Bimbisar asked him, \"One question arose in my mind -- when I saw my old friend Prasannachandra, who has become a monk, a disciple of yours, a question arose in my mind: if he dies right now, where will he be born?\"\nJainas say there are seven hells and seven heavens -- \"Into what heaven will he be born?\"\nBimbisar asked. \"Of course, there is no question of his being born in hell -- he has renounced such a great kingdom and all -- in what heaven?\"\nAnd Mahavira said, \"He would have gone to the seventh hell -- if he had died the time you touched his feet.\"\nBimbisar was shocked. He said, \"Into the seventh hell? Then what about me? There are no other hells below the seventh. My friend, who has renounced all and looks so pious and so silent and so serene, he is going to be born into the seventh hell?\"\nMahavira said, \"Don't be worried: if he dies now, he will be born into the seventh heaven.\" And just a few minutes had passed.\nBimbisar said, \"You puzzle me very much. Now you have confused me even more. What has happened within these few minutes that he will be born into the seventh heaven?\"\nMahavira said, \"You don't know the whole story. Just before you, your prime minister had passed. He had come to accompany you just to see that everything is safe. Your prime minister, your generals and your guards, they passed just a few minutes before you.\nAnd your prime minister said, 'Look at this fool, this Prasannachandra! He would have been a great king and he has become hypnotized by this Mahavira. And now standing naked in this heat, wasting his life He used to be a beautiful\nman -- now look at his body. And he is an utter fool, because he has trusted his prime minister and has given the whole kingdom to him till his children are grown up enough to take possession of it --\nand the prime minister is a cheat. And by the time the children are grown up, there will be nothing left in the treasury.'\n\"Hearing this, Prasannachandra forgot completely that he has become a monk --\ncompletely! He was so shocked and be-came so angry, and he said inside his heart, 'I am still alive.' And his hand, just out of old habit went to his sword -- which was not there.\nHe pulled the sword out of the sheath and said, 'I will go and kill this man immediately.'\nAnd in his imagination he cut the head of the prime minister.\n\"When you touched his feet,\" Mahavira said, \"he had just killed the prime minister.\nHence, I told you that in that moment if he had died he would have gone to the seventh hell -- he was in a murderous attitude. Now, things have changed. When he put his sword back into the sheath, he recognized, 'What am I doing? Where is the sword, and where is the sheath? And what have I done? Killed my prime minister in imagination! It is as much a crime as actually killing a person.\n\" 'Mahavira says, \"Whether you think of killing or you kill, it makes no difference -- it is the same, psychologically it is the same.\" What have I done? When I have renounced, have renounced! Who am I to interfere now? If he cheats that is HIS business; if he breaks the trust, HE will suffer for it. But who am I to punish him? I am finished with all this. And who are my children, and what is my kingdom?'\n\"And a great understanding came to him. He became quiet, silent, serene, detached. Right now if he dies, he is in such a beautiful space that he will be born in the seventh heaven.\"\nThe question is of the mind, not of the world. You can go to the Himalayan caves, but what are you going to think about? You will think of the world. That's why Kabir says: AVADHU MAYA TAJI NA JAI.\nIt is very difficult to drop this mind.\nFRIEND, PLEASE TELL ME WHAT I CAN DO ABOUT THIS WORLD...\nthe world of the mind\n... I HOLD TO, AND KEEP SPINNING OUT!\nI GAVE UP SEWN CLOTHES AND WORE A ROBE,\nBUT I NOTICED ONE DAY THE CLOTH WAS WELL WOVEN.\nHE SAYS: I RENOUNCED BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES and wore a robe, but then one day I saw, \"Even this robe is well woven -- my mind has played a trick. I am still as much concerned about my clothes as before. I still want to look beautiful, I still want to look special, I still want to look somebody. The mind has played a trick with me. I am the same man.\nI have dropped those beautiful clothes and now I am wearing a single robe, but it doesn't matter -- the mind can project in the same way.\" The screen makes no difference: the film continues the same. You can use the wall as the screen, and you can project the same film. You need not have a perfect screen. The film is the same, even projected on the wall; the wall may be rough, may be a poor man's house wall, but it makes no difference\n-- the film is the same.\nKabir says: I recognized it, \"Mind is still functioning in the same way. I still walk in such a way that people should recognize me, that I am no ordinary man. I used to walk in my beautiful clothes -- why do people use beautiful clothes? So that they look special. Now I am wearing a robe, but still, deep down, the same desire persists.\"\nThe original is:\nGIRAH TAJ KE BASTAR BANDHA, BASTAR TAJ KE FERI.\nI have left the house, I have moved to the cave, with only a small bag, but then one day I recognize that the cave has become the home, the cave has become the house. And the small possession that I brought with me can function perfectly well for my possessiveness. My possessiveness remains the same! Now if somebody enters into the cave, I am going to say, \"Get out! This is my cave.\"\nYou can go and see this. Go to the Himalayas, enter into some cave and some yogi will be sitting there, and he will say, \"Get out! What are you doing here? This is my cave. I have lived here for thirty years. If you want to live in a cave, find your own.\"\nNow what is the difference? -- 'my house' or 'my cave'. The question is of 'my' and 'mine'.\nSo Kabir says: I left the house with a small bag, went to the cave, but I found it was the same -- because I am the same. So I left the cave and I left that small possession and became a wanderer, but nothing changes. Now I feel great that I am a wanderer, that I am no ordinary monk who lives in the shelter and safety of a cave. I live in insecurity -- look!\nThis is how one should live. I am a wanderer with no security, no safety. Now this wandering has become a prop to my ego.\nGIRAH TAJ KE BASTAR BANDHA, BASTAR TAJ KE FERI.\nNow I have become a vagabond, but great pride has arisen in me. SO I BOUGHT SOME BURLAP, BUT I STILL\nTHROW IT ELEGANTLY OVER MY LEFT SHOULDER.\nSeeing that the robe was well woven, I purchased coarse canvas and made a shawl out of it -- BUT STILL I THROW IT ELEGANTLY OVER my LEFT\nSHOULDER. The same mind.\nYou can stand naked in the sun -- it doesn't matter: it will be the same mind. How is one going to drop the mind? It comes from the backdoor; it finds new ways to enter back into you.\nI PULLED BACK MY SEXUAL LONGINGS,\nAND NOW I DISCOVER THAT I'M ANGRY A LOT.\nTHIS IS OF TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCE TO UNDERSTAND. Kabir has\nlooked deep into the human mind and its workings, its subtle cunning ways. And he has found exactly the whole process of inner alchemy. If you repress, this is how things happen.\nI PULLED BACK MY SEXUAL LONGINGS,\nAND NOW I DISCOVER THAT I'M ANGRY A LOT.\nIf you repress sex you will become angry; the whole energy that was becoming sex will become anger. And it is better to be sexual than to be angry. In sex at least there is something of love; in anger there is only pure violence and nothing else. If sex is repressed, the person becomes violent -- either to others he will be violent, or to himself These are the two possibilities: either he will become a sadist and will torture others, or he will become a masochist and will torture himself. But torture he will.\nDo you know, down the ages, the soldiers have not been allowed to have sexual relationships? Why? Because if soldiers are allowed to have sexual relationships they don't gather enough anger in them, enough violence in them. Their sex becomes a release, they become soft, and a soft person cannot fight. Starve the soldier of sex and he is bound to fight better. In fact, his violence will be a substitute for his sexuality.\nAnd Sigmund Freud is again right when he says that all our weapons are nothing but phallic symbols: the sword, the knife, the bayonet -- they are nothing but phallic symbols.\nThe soldier has not been allowed to enter into somebody's body. into some woman's body. Now he is going crazy to enter; now he can do anything. A great perverted desire has entered into his being now. Repressed sex -- he would like to enter into somebody's body through a bayonet, through a sword...\nDown the ages, the soldier was forced to repress his sexual desires.\nIn this century we have seen one thing happening. American soldiers are the most well-equipped soldiers in the world -- scientifically, technologically, they are the most well-equipped soldiers, but they proved weaker than any other soldier. In Vietnam, a poor country, for years on end they tried and had to accept defeat. Why? For the first time in history the American soldier is sexually satisfied -- that is the problem. The first soldier in history who is sexually\nsatisfied, who is not starved sexually. He cannot win. A poor country like Vietnam, a small country like Vietnam -- it is a miracle; if you don't understand the psychology, it is a miracle. With all the technology, with all the modern science, with all the power... and the American soldier could not do anything.\nBut this is not new; this is an ancient truth. The whole history of India proves it. India is a big country, one of the biggest, next only to China, the second biggest country in the world, and it was conquered many times by small countries. Turks, Mongols, Greeks --\nanybody came and this big country was immediately defeated, conquered. What was the reason? And those people who had come to conquer were poor people, starving.\nMy own analysis of Indian history is that in the past India w as not sexually repressed.\nThose were the days when temples like Khajuraho, Konarak, Puri, were built -- India was not sexually repressed. In spite of the few so-called mahatmas, the greater part of the country was sexually satisfied; there was a softness, a loving quality, a grace. It was difficult for India to fight. For what? Just think of yourself: if you want to fight, you will have to starve yourself sexually for a few days. You can ask Mohammed Ali and other boxers: before they fight, for a few days they have to become celibates. That's a must!\nYou can ask the Olympic competitors: before they participate in Olympic competitions, for a few days they have to starve themselves sexually. It gives a thrust, it gives great violence -- it makes you capable of fighting. You run faster, you attack faster, because the energy is boiling within. Hence the soldier has been repressed.\nJust allow all the armies of the world to be sexually satisfied and there will be peace. Just allow people sexual satisfaction, and there will be less Hindu/Mohammedan riots, less Christian and Mohammedan crusades -- all that nonsense will disappear. If love spreads, war will disappear -- both cannot exist together.\nKabir is exactly right. He says:\nI PULLED BACK MY SEXUAL LONGINGS,\nAND NOW I DISCOVER THAT I'M ANGRY A LOT.\nA great observer he is, a very minute observer. This is what awareness is. He is watching: he represses his sexual desire and watches -- \"Now what is happening inside?\" Soon he finds that he becomes more angry -- for no reason at all, just angry, irritated, ready to fight with anybody, any excuse will do.\nAnd remember, sex can be transformed because it is a natural energy; anger is not so natural, one step removed from nature. Now it will be difficult to change anger. First anger will have to be changed into sex, only then can anything be done -- that's what my work here is. And that's what I am being condemned for all over the world.\nI am trying to change your anger into sex -- first that has to be done. That is the way of inner change. First all your perversions have to disappear, and you have to become a natural human being. You have to become a natural animal, to be exact. And then only can you become divine. The animal can be transformed into the divine, but your animal is also very perverted, your animal is not sane -- your animal has become insane. First the insanity has to be transformed, changed. Change anger!\nThat's why I send people first to encounter groups and then to Tantra. First they have to go into some encounter group type phenomenon; some process where their anger can be expressed, relaxed. Then only can they move into some process of Tantra, into some inner alchemy that can use sexual energy as a vehicle.\nBut people who are angry will not understand it. Anger does not allow understanding.\nNow if you want to become a politician, you have to repress your sex -- otherwise you will not be able to compete, you will not be able to reach New Delhi -- impossible. It is not an accident that Morarji Desai has reached there -- fifty years of sexual repression is bound to help him become the prime minister of the country. So much rage! It is difficult to compete with such people; they go madly into competition. They don't look sideways, they simply go ahead; they don't care what happens. By fair or foul means, but they have to reach the top.\nPoliticians can succeed only if they are sexually repressed people. Adolf Hitler was sexually repressed, very repressed. Had he been in deep love with a single\nwoman there would have been no Second World War. Had he loved a single human being deeply, the whole history of humanity would have been different. But he was very sexually suppressed.\nHe was as big a mahatma as Morarji Desai -- in fact a little bigger. He was a vegetarian, you will be surprised to know. To find a vegetarian in Germany is difficult! but he was a vegetarian. He was not a smoker; he was against drinking any kind of intoxicating beverages. He used to go early to bed and would get up early in the morning. He avoided all kinds of loving relationships -- what to say about love? -- he had not even a single friend. There was not a single man vv-ho could call him friend. He never allowed that much closeness. He was afraid, continuously afraid of his sexuality.\nThis man became the cause of the greatest war the world has known. My own feeling is that had he smoked a little bit, had he become drunk once in a while, had he fallen in love with a woman, the whole history of humanity would have been different. Then he would have been soft, then he would have been more human, more accepting of his own limitations, and hence more accepting of others' limitations. He would have been more humane.\nSays Kabir:\nI PULLED BACK MY SEXUAL LONGINGS,\nAND NOW I DISCOVER THAT I'M ANGRY A LOT. I GAVE UP RAGE, AND NOW I NOTICE\nTHAT I AM GREEDY ALL DAY.\nSO HE REPRESSED HIS ANGER -- hm? -- that s what one will logically do. You repress sex, anger bubbles up; you repress anger. But he is a close observer, a very minute observer. He says: The moment I repressed my anger I became greedy.\nThis too is proved: if you watch human history you will find a thousand and one proofs for it. For example, in India Mahavira taught non-violence, and the result has been that all the followers of Mahavira became the most greedy people in the world -- they are the Jews of India. The Jainas are the Jews of India. Why did they become so greedy?\nMahavira taught them to be non-violent. Obviously, they started repressing anger; that is the only way that seems possible to the stupid mind: Repress anger! Don't be violent.\nAnd they tried really hard; in every possible way they tried not to be violent. They even stopped agriculture because it is a kind of violence: you will have to pull the plants and cut the crop, and that is violence because plants have life. So Jainas stopped agriculture completely.\nNow, they cannot go to the army, they cannot be KSHATRIYAS -- they cannot become warriors -- because of their ideology of non-violence, and they cannot even be agriculturalists, gardeners; that is impossible. They would not like to become SUDRAS --\nthe untouchables -- who clean the roads, the sweepers and the cobblers, because that is too humiliating. And brahmins won't allow them to function as brahmins -\n- brahmins are very jealous about that. They have been in power for centuries and they don't allow anybody: nobody can become a brahmin; one has to be a brahmin only by birth. You may become a great, learned man -- that doesn't matter -- but you can't be a brahmin. There is no way of becoming a brahmin; you have to be born one only. You have to be very careful when you choose your parents; that is the only opportunity to become a brahmin.\nSo Jainas could not be brahmins, would not like to become SUDRAS were not able to become warriors -- then what was left for them? Only business -- they became business people. And all their repressed anger became their greed. They became great money-maniacs. Their number is very small; in India their number is so small, not more than thirty LAKHS. In a country of sixty CRORES thirty LAKHS IS nothing. But they possess more money than anybody else. You will not find a Jaina beggar anywhere; they are all rich people.\nMahavira wanted them to be non-violent, and what really happened was totally different: they became greedy. Repress your anger and you will be greedy.\nI GAVE UP RAGE AND NOW I NOTICE THAT I AM GREEDY ALL DAY.\nI WORKED HARD AT DISSOLVING THE GREED,\nAND NOW I AM PROUD OF MYSELF.\nSo he repressed his greed and the ultimate result is: he has become a great egoist; he finds himself being very proud. \"Look! I have repressed sex, repressed anger, repressed greed -\n- I have done this, I have done that. I have done impossible things!\" Now a great 'I' arises, the ego becomes strengthened.\nThat's wh you will find the most crystallized egos in the monks and the nuns. You will not find such crystallized egos anywhere else. The more a person renounces, the more he represses, the more egoistic he becomes. Indians are very egoistic and the reason? -- they have all tried in some way or other to be religious. And the only way seems to be repression -- and repression brings ego.\nA non-repressed person becomes a non-egoist; he cannot carry the ego. There is no prop to support it. He becomes humble, he becomes simple, he becomes ordinary, he has no claim -- he knows he is nothing. This whole process that Kabir is describing is beautiful.\nRepression is not the way: transformation is the way. Don't repress anything. If sexuality is there, don't repress it otherwise you will create a new complexity -- which will be more difficult to tackle. And if you repress anger, greed is even more difficult then, and if you repress greed, arises ego, pride, which is the MOST difficult thing to drop.\nMove back: from pride to greed, from greed to anger, from anger to sex. And if you can come to the natural, spontaneous sexuality, things will be very simple. Things will be so simple that you cannot imagine. Then you energy is natural, and natural energy creates no hindrance in transformation. Hence I say: from sex to superconsciousness. Not from anger, not from greed, not from ego, but from sex to superconsciousness.\nThe transformation can happen only if first you accept your natural being. Whatsoever is natural is good. Yes, more is possible, but the more will be possible only if you accept your nature with totality -- if you welcome it, if you have no guilt about it. To be guilty, to feel guilty, is to be irreligious. In the past you have been told just the opposite: Feel guilty and you are religious. I say to you: Feel guilty and you will never be religious.\nDrop all guilt!\nYou are whatsoever God has made you. You are whatso-ever existence has made you.\nSex is not your creation: it is God's gift. Something tremendously valuable is hidden in it\n-- it is just a shell of your samadhi. If the seed is broken, the shell is broken, the flower will bloom -- but not by repression. You will have to learn inner gardening, you will have to become a gardener, you will have to learn how to use dirty fertilizers, manure, and transform manure into roses.\nReligion is the most delicate art.\nWHEN THE MIND WANTS TO BREAK ITS LINK WITH\nTHE WORLD, says Kabir,\nIT STILL HOLDS ON TO ONE THING.\nAND THE ULTIMATE PROBLEM IS: you call leave one thing, but you cling to another. You leave that and you cling to another. You go on changing things, but the clinging remains. The clinging has to disappear. How can the clinging disappear? Only by understanding, awareness, meditation; not by doing anything about it. If you do, you will create a new clinging.\nAn ancient story:\nA man was very much afraid of ghosts, and the problem was more troublesome because he had to pass through a cemetery every day while going to work and coming back from work. And sometimes, if he had to come in the night -- overtime work or something and he was delayed -- then it was really a problem to pass through the cemetery. It was only a three, four minute walk, but it was almost a death to him.\nHe went to a fakir and he said, \"Do something. I have heard you do miracles. And I don't ask much -- I ask only a simple thing: give me somehow some protection so that I can pass through the cemetery without fear.\"\nHe said, \"This is so simple, there is no problem in it. Take this locket and keep it always with you -- it will protect you from ghosts. No ghost can ever trouble you.\"\nHe tried and, really, no ghost troubled him. In fact, there are no ghosts; it was only his fear. With the locket in hand, he went through the cemetery, from this side to that, from that side to this. He tried at different times, even in the middle of the night -- and it worked. And he said, \"It is really powerful. this locket! This man is a miracle man.\"\nThe whole miracle was this: that there were no ghosts -- there are no ghosts anywhere.\nBut now this idea that he had a protection helped him.\nBut then a new problem arose: he started becoming afraid that somebody might steal it, or some day he might forget it somewhere, or he might have put it outside and be taking a bath and ghosts might come there So he had to carry it\neverywhere -- it became an obsession. The wife would say, \"It looks embarrassing. People ask me, 'Why does your husband go on carrying this locket in his hand, this stupid locket? What is the matter with him? He never leaves it.'\" Even in the night when he went to sleep he would keep it in his hand. Even once or twice in the night he would wake up to see whether the locket was in his hand or not, because it might have fallen in his sleep, and ghosts might jump on his chest: \"And they must be waiting to take revenge!\"\nNow one problem is solved, another problem has arisen -- and far more complicated, because the ghosts used to torture him only once in a while when he was late or he had to pass through the cemetery. In twenty-four hours, just for one or two minutes the problem was there. Now it was a twenty-four-hour problem -- the locket: \"If it is lost, if somebody takes it away, if I forget it somewhere \" Even in sleep it was difficult to sleep totally.\nHe had to keep a little alert. He started becoming ill because the sleep was not good, and he was so constantly afraid.\nHe went to another fakir who said, \"I will give you another thing. Keep this box; this locket is creating trouble -- this box is far more powerful. You can even keep it six feet away from you and its power works.\"\nHe said, \"This is far better. At least I can go into my bathroom leaving it outside.\"\nBut now the new problem arose. The locket he was always keeping in his hand; now he was taking the bath inside and the box was outside...\"If children, just in playing, take it away or something happens?!\" Now it was even more difficult: that six foot distance.\nThe story is significant: this is not the way to drop the ghosts! You will have to cling to something or other. The ghosts are not to be dropped; your eyes have to be opened so that you can see that there are no ghosts at all. The problem disappears. The problem is not solved but dissolved.\nWHEN THE MIND WANTS TO BREAK ITS LINK WITH THE WORLD\nIT STILL HOLDS ON TO ONE THING.\nAnd unless you drop ALL clinging -- ALL clinging, I say -- unless you are ready to be nothing, empty, nobody, with no protection, with no security, no safety, unless you are ready to be in that kind of space... which will look like death in the beginning. And it is a kind of death: the old dies, but then the new arises. And the new can arise only when the old is gone. The old has to cease for the new to be. Only when all clinging disappears --\nyou are not clinging even to the name of God, you are not clinging even to the Master, you are not clinging to the scripture, you are simply in a state of nonclinging -- then suddenly from your own inner source a great light wells up, a great bliss wells up. You are transformed.\nMind is not dropped -- it is a ghost. And if you try methods to drop it, you will cling to the methods. Then those methods will torture you. But you will remain always in bondage.\nKABIR SAYS: LISTEN MY FRIEND,\nTHERE ARE VERY FEW THAT FIND THE PATH!\nA FEW PEOPLE REMAIN INDULGENT, remain animals; a few people start\nrepressing the animal, become obsessed with repressions, perversions. Only rarely does it happen that a person is neither indulgent, nor repressive -- only when a person is neither does he find the secret key to the door of the divine.\nThe original is:\nMAN BAIRAGI MAYA TYAGI, SHABD MEN SURAT SAMAI.\nKabir says: I have become a sannyasin, a renunciate, I have dropped the world, but that doesn't matter. Now I cling to God, now God has become my world.\nMAN BAIRAGI MAYA TYAGI, SHABD MEN SURAT SAMAI.\nNow the name of God -- SHABD -- has become my treasure, now I cling to it. Now the idea of God has become the center of my clinging.\nKAHAIN KABIR SUNO BHAI SADHO, YAH GAM BIRLE PAI.\nVery few people there are who have found the secret path. Out of a hundred, ninety remain indulgent in the animal; they never move beyond the animal. Out of the remaining ten, nine become repressive and pathological. Only one out of a hundred finds the true way. What is the true way?\nThe true way is that of understanding your mind, not of dropping it. The true way is: sitting silently and watching your mind -- all its cunning ways, subtle ways, all its strategies -- just watch, just be a witness to your mind. And, slowly slowly, by witnessing it you will understand what games it has been playing with you. You stop it from one door, it comes from another door; you stop it from that door, it makes a third door -- and it goes on and on, ad nauseam.\nWatch.… Don't renounce the world, and don't try to drop the mind. Just become more alert. In that alertness, suddenly mind disappears, and with the mind disappears the whole world.

IT</p><p>FEELS SO MUCH LIKE A NO TO ALL THESE OLD THINGS. IS IT JUST AWARENESS
AND LOVE THAT IS IT?</p><p>Prem Mariam,</p><p>REVOLUTION IS NO, REBELLION IS YES. Revolution is negative,
rebellion</p><p>is positive. Revolution says no to all that is wrong and should not
be. Rebellion says yes to all that is beautiful, good. Revolution is
past-oriented, rebellion is present-oriented. They are not
synonymous.</p><p>Revolution is destructive, rebellion is creative. Revolution can
never be feminine, receptive, yes-saying. That is impossible. But
rebellion is always feminine, always receptive, always yes-saying.</p><p>I am talking about rebellion, I am not talking about revolution.
Revolution is political, rebellion is spiritual. Revolution is of the
crowd, rebellion is individual. You can be a rebel and you don't need
anybody else to be with you -- you alone can be a rebel. But you alone
cannot be a revolutionary; you will need a great organization, you will
need a great army behind you.</p><p>And the problem is -- one of the most significant things to be
understood -- that when you fight with somebody, slowly slowly, you
become like your enemy. It's bound to be so; it follows a certain
natural course. If you have to fight with somebody, you have to be like
him; otherwise you will not be able to fight with him. Choose your enemy
very carefully.</p><p>Friends can be chosen without much care -- they don't affect you so
much -- but enemies are very decisive.</p><p>All revolutions fail because of the enemy. The enemy decides the
whole thing. The czars of Russia decided the structure of the communist
party; the czars decided how Joseph Stalin was going to be. And he
proved a bigger czar than any other czar, and he proved even more
terrible than Ivan the Terrible.</p><p>Fighting with the czar, fighting with the imperialist structure of
the czar, they learnt the whole strategy, all the tactics. By the time
they came in power, they were perfectly groomed by the czar, by the
enemy. By the time they came in power, they started behaving in the same
way against their enemies as the czar had been behaving with them.</p><p>This you can see all over the world again and again. Right now this
is happening in Iran.</p><p>The Emperor is gone, and a far worse regime has taken his place.
Khomeini is proving at least ten times more violent than the Emperor
himself. Khomeini has learnt the whole strategy from the Emperor; his
whole life he has suffered,</p><p>struggled. That has been his school. Now, with a vengeance, he is
proving himself to be a bigger emperor than the Emperor himself Now,
every day, hundreds of people are being executed, killed.</p><p>This has happened always: revolutions fail because they are
reactions. Never be a revolutionary: be a rebel. A rebel is not AGAINST
the past; the past is not even worth that. To be against it m.ans to be
focussed on it; to be against it means you are paying too much attention
to it. To be against it means you are hypnotized by it.</p><p>A few are for it -- they are hypnotized. And a few are against it --
they are hypnotized.</p><p>The rebel is one who simply sees the whole futility of it, and
without fighting drops it. If you fight, it will cling to you; if you
fight, you have to cling to it. It will become your definition. Don't
let the past define you; simply slip out of it, just like a snake slips
out of the old skin -- and never even looks back. That is the way of the
rebel.</p><p>I teach the way of the rebel. That is the way of religion -- religion
is rebellion, not revolution. And it gives immense respect to the
individual. Each one can be a rebel in his own way: just simply slip out
of the past. There is no need to struggle with it -- it is no MORE
there. And if you go on fighting... you don't have that long a life. The
past has been very long -- millions of years -- how are you going to
fight with it in a life that consists at the most of seventy or eighty
years? In this small life span, how are you going to fight with the past
which is so huge, immense?</p><p>The only wise way is to slip out of it; there is no need to fight
with it. And this has to be understood on many levels.</p><p>Politically, people fight with the past -- the Hindu past, the
Christian past, the Mohammedan past -- and they become like the past
they are fighting with.</p><p>Psychologically, since Sigmund Freud, people are fighting with their
own individual pasts -- the childhood traumas. That too is big, and if
you have to sort it out and fight with everything and put everything
right, your whole present and future will be wasted in it. The past is
already wasted, the present will be wasted in psychoanalysis, and the
whole future you will be fighting, and fighting with the past. And to
fight with the past is to fight with a shadow -- you can never</p><p>win. How can you win against a shadow? It does not exist in the first
place. You have only to see that it is a shadow! and that is that.</p><p>That is the basic difference between the psychological approach
towards life and the religious approach. Religion simply says: "Be more
meditative, be more aware. Be right now here!" In that very awareness,
in that crystal-clear consciousness, you see that the past is an
unnecessary burden -- you need not carry it. Nobody can force you to
carry it; you are carrying it on your own, it is your decision.</p><p>Your parents are not there to enforce it... it is already gone! Just
shadows are lingering.</p><p>See that they are shadows, and you are free. In that very seeing is
freedom. In that very understanding is liberation. And then all your
energies are available to be herenow. Then you can bloom! Then you can
blossom. Then your life can have some fulfillment, some joy, some
celebration.</p><p>Revolution is against the past and for the future -- both are
non-existential. The past is no more and the future is not yet. And
revolution consists only of past and future: against the past and for
some future utopia. The word 'utopia' is very beautiful; literally it
means 'that which never comes'.</p><p>Rebellion consists of the present and only the present. It has no
concern with the past, it has no concern with the future. It loves,
lives, dances, sings, but its space is here, and its time is now. And
then you can be feminine, and then you can be receptive, and then you
can be yea-saying.</p><p>The second question Question 2</p><p>OSHO, I ONCE READ SOMEWHERE THAT WHEN BUDDHA WAS ASKED BY A DISCIPLE
TO DESCRIBE LIFE BRIEFLY, THE BUDDHA REPLIED 'MISERY'. IS</p><p>THIS TRUE?</p><p>Zareen,</p><p>IT IS TRUE. But if a Buddha had asked Buddha, "What is life? --
describe briefly," he would have said, "Bliss." The answer has nothing
to do with the question; the answer has something to do with the
questioner. The answer depends on the questioner. A man like Gautam
Buddha does not answer questions, he answers questioners. He is not
saying anything about life, mind you -- he is not saying anything about
life. He is saying something about the life of the man who had asked the
question.</p><p>Buddha is not saying about his own life that it is a misery;
certainly it is not. Nobody has seen such grandeur, such bliss; nobody
has walked on this earth with such grace, such utter celebration. Nobody
does humanity remember who has been more beautiful. How can Buddha say
that life is misery? You should remember: he is not talking about life
as such; he is talking about the life of the man who had asked the
question.</p><p>And then it becomes a problem, because for forty-two years Buddha
continued answering people, and different people required different
answers, and sometimes contradictory answers. A Buddha has to contradict
himself almost every day.</p><p>Once it happened:</p><p>In the morning a man asked Buddha, Is there a God?" and Buddha said,
"No." And in the afternoon another person asked, "Is there a God?" and
Buddha said, "Yes." And by the evening a third person asked, "Is there a
God?" and Buddha kept quiet, didn't answer, remained silent.</p><p>Ananda, who was Buddha's chief disciple, was present on all three
occasions. He was continuously behind Buddha like a shadow -- serving
him, taking care of his body, looking after his needs. He was very much
puzzled: "In a single day Buddha has said there is no God, Buddha has
said there is a God, and Buddha has kept silent too, he has not answered
this way or that. These are the only three possibilities -- all the
possibilities exhausted, in a single day? All the answers given."</p><p>He could not sleep; he tossed and turned, and Buddha asked, "What is
the matter with you tonight? Are you not tired or something?"</p><p>He said, "I don't want to disturb you, but unless you answer me this
question I don't think I will be able to sleep. In the morning you said
no, in the afternoon</p><p>you said yes, and by the evening you remained silent, you didn't
answer -- and the question was exactly the same!"</p><p>Buddha laughed and he said, "The person who had come early in the
morning and had asked 'Is there a God?' was a theist, was a believer. He
wanted me to say yes so that his belief could become more strengthened
-- and I don't strengthen people's beliefs, because a believing mind is
never a seeing mind. To believe is to remain in darkness. I wanted to
shatter his belief. My answer had nothing to do with God; my answer had
something to do with that man. He was there just to accumulate a little
more evidence for his belief, so he could say to people that 'Not only
do I believe that there is a God, but even Buddha says there is a
God!'</p><p>"He had not come to understand. He simply wanted me to be a witness
to HIS belief And his belief is just out of fear, a conditioning taught
by others. His belief is nothing but a cover-up for his ignorance. I
cannot be in any way a help to it. I had to shatter it. I had to shout
no, emphatically. And it helped. 'Buddha says no?' Enquiry started in
his being.</p><p>Now he cannot be at rest with his belief He will have to come -- you
will see."</p><p>And one day he came again, and he said to Buddha, "You did it: since
that time my worship has become empty. Since that time I go to the
temple, but the temple no longer has any deity in it. Since that time I
know it is only a belief. If you say God is not, then who am I to say
God is? You are so godly, you must be true. I have come to enquire.</p><p>Now I come to you without any belief. Now I come to you open -- to
seek, to search.</p><p>Now my question is not rooted in my knowledge." And Buddha said to
Ananda, "The second person was an atheist -- he believed that there is
no God. He had come in the same way as the first one: to have my
support." His belief was as stupid as the first one's, because to
believe without knowing is to be stupid. Believe only when you have
known, but then it is not a belief at all; it is a totally different
experience. It is trust. It is not based on somebody else's experience;
it is your OWN experience. You are reborn in it. It is not Hindu,
Christian, Mohammedan -- it is simply your experience. And even if the
whole world says it is not so, you cannot deny it, your trust cannot be
shaken.</p><p>"The other person," Buddha said, "was an atheist, hence I had to say
YES, and</p><p>emphatically I had to say yes."</p><p>Ananda said, "And what about the third?"</p><p>Buddha said, "He was neither a theist, nor an atheist, so neither was
yes needed nor was no needed. He was really an innocent soul, a very
pure heart. His question was not out of his a priori knowledge; his
question was really innocent. His question was a quest, an enquiry. I
had to remain silent -- because that was my answer to him. And he
understood it.</p><p>"Did you not watch: when I remained silent and closed my eyes, he
also closed his eyes, and a great silence descended on him. And did you
not observe? -- when he went his eyes were shining, his eyes were like
lit candles. And did you not observe? -- when he left, he touched my
feet, bowed down, thanked me, saying 'You answered rightly,' although I
had not answered him at all. That man tasted something of my silence,
imbibed something of my being. That man was the true seeker."</p><p>A true seeker does not need a verbal answer: a true seeker needs
something existential --</p><p>a penetration of the heart into the heart, a penetration of the soul
into the soul. The real seeker wants the Master to overlap him. The real
seeker wants the Master to go into his innermost core and stir the
sleeping soul.</p><p>Zareen, your question is significant. You say:</p><p>I ONCE READ SOMEWHERE THAT WHEN BUDDHA WAS ASKED BY A</p><p>DISCIPLE TO DESCRIBE LIFE BRIEFLY, THE BUDDHA REPLIED 'MISERY.'</p><p>It is true. Many times he said to many people that life is misery;
and many times he said to many people that life is bliss --
SATCHITANANDA -- it is truth, it is consciousness, it is bliss.</p><p>But people have gathered more the answer that life is misery, because
it fits with their own experience. When the Buddha says, "Life is joy,"
it doesn't fit with your experience.</p><p>It falls on flat ears. You hear it, but you cannot understand it. It
does not ring any bells in your heart.</p><p>So the answers that he gave to those who had come to know something
of bliss, something of joy, something of song, have not become so
important. And it was only rarely that he would say that, because it is
only a rare person who will require that answer. Millions and millions
need to be told, "Your life is misery." It IS so.</p><p>But why does Buddha say your life is misery, why? He says it so that
you can come out of it. You can have another kind of life -- this is not
the only kind! This is only one of the ways, and the worst way possible.
You have created a hell out of your life; and if it can be a hell, it
can also be a heaven; if it can be misery, it can be bliss. It is the
same energy used wrongly that becomes misery, AND used rightly becomes
bliss.</p><p>What is misery? Misery is feeling separate from existence, feeling
isolated from existence, feeling alienated from existence -- that is
misery. And what is bliss? Feeling one with existence, orgasmically one
with existence, organically one with existence.</p><p>Having an ego is misery, and becoming egolessness is bliss. Both
alternatives are open.</p><p>The choice is yours.</p><p>Zareen, listening to Buddha's answer that life is misery, don't
settle there. His answer is to unsettle you. His answer is to shock you.
His answer is to wake you up to the fact that your life is misery. But
people are really cunning, very cunning; they listen only to that which
they want to listen to. People are so cunning that listening to the
statement that life is misery, they say, ''Then nothing can be done. If
life is misery, then I have to live a miserable life, then this is all
there is -- so live it! Live it anyhow."</p><p>Rather than creating a desire to transform themselves, they
completely drown themselves in their misery -- as if Buddha has given
them a certificate that this is what life is all about. People are so
cunning, they simply listen only to that which they want to listen
to.</p><p>"This is all a mistake, Your Honour," said the first harlot. "I was
walking along</p><p>and this guy "</p><p>"Just a minute, young lady," said the judge. "Now, you have been here
a dozen times --</p><p>one hundred dollars fine. Next!"</p><p>"I am just a poor private secretary," said the second girl, "and I
was not doing anything "</p><p>"I recognize you too, miss," said the magistrate. "Two hundred
dollars or ten days in jail.</p><p>Next case!"</p><p>"Judge," said the third girl, "I am a prostitute. I am not proud of
it, but it is the only way I can support my three kids. I am
guilty."</p><p>"Young woman," said the judge, "I like your honesty, and because of
it I am going to give you a break. Your case is dismissed and, sergeant,
give this girl fifty dollars out of the policemen's fund."</p><p>Now comes poor old Liebowitz, arrested for selling ties without a
license. "Your Honour," he pleaded. "I'm not gonna lie to you -- I am a
prostitute too "</p><p>Beware of your mind -- it is always trying ways and means,
strategies, tactics, to remain as it is. It can wear masks, it can
become religious, it can go to the church, it can read the Bibles and
the Vedas and still it will find only ways and</p><p>means to remain itself.</p><p>Zareen, Buddha's statement has been taken by people as if he has
said, "Life cannot be bliss." It is impossible. "Life is misery and it
is going to remain misery</p><p>-- to be miserable is life's intrinsic quality," people have taken it
that way. That is not true. I know it is not true.</p><p>I say to you: your life is misery, but it need not be so. It is
misery because you have not tried to transform it; you have not worked
on it. It is misery because you are still unborn.</p><p>It is misery because the opportunity is being wasted, and you are not
being</p><p>creative. It is misery because you are not behaving
intelligently.</p><p>Be intelligent. And I don't mean by 'intelligence' be intellectual --
intellectuals are not necessarily intelligent people, and intelligent
people are not necessarily intellectuals.</p><p>Almost always the case is that the intellectual is only a pretend, he
is pseudo; by being intellectual he is trying to convince himself and
others that he is intelligent.</p><p>What is the criterion of being an intelligent person? Only one
criterion: if you can create bliss in your life you are intelligent --
otherwise there is no other way to prove it. If you can create a
paradise around yourself, if you can remain in a constant cheerfulness,
cheerfulness becomes just your very milieu, then you are
intelligent.</p><p>Be intelligent and life is bliss; be stupid and life is misery. It
all depends on you. The third question</p><p>Osho, Question 3</p><p>AND THE MIND GOES BANANAS... "SURRENDER, DO YOUR OWN THING." "TRUST,
LIVE YOUR LIFE..."</p><p>SLOWLY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING AND SOMETIMES IT
FEELS VERY GOOD. BUT STILL I WANT TO KNOW.</p><p>Varidhi,</p><p>THE MIND NEVER GOES BANANAS -- it is bananas. You say: SURRENDER,
DO</p><p>YOUR OWN THING. I will suggest you put just two words between these
two: SURRENDER and then DO YOUR OWN THING. Because once you have</p><p>surrendered, you are not there, God is. Then doing your own thing is
doing God's thing: Thy kingdom come, thy will be done.</p><p>First dissolve yourself, then God is your you, then God is your self
You have just missed those two simple words 'and then'.</p><p>Surrender AND THEN do your own thing. Trust AND THEN live your own
life.</p><p>Surrender and trust are not two things; it is the same phenomenon.
You can surrender only if you trust, and you can trust only if you
surrender. They go hand in band. They are inseparable. If one happens,
the other is bound to have already happened. Just those two words that
are missing are creating trouble for you: and then.</p><p>A man came to St. Augustine and asked him, "I am illiterate, very
old, not much life is left. I cannot go into great austerities; the
energy is ebbing. I am just on the verge of death. I have walked many
miles just to see you and ask you something very simple. I have not come
to listen to great philosophy -- just something very simple, a single
word will do. You just simply tell me a single word that I can keep in
my heart and I can follow it for whatsoever of my life is left."</p><p>It is said St. Augustine closed his eyes... his disciples were very
much puzzled. It had never happened before. Great theologians had come,
great philosophers had visited; they had asked very complicated, very
difficult questions, and Augustine was never known to meditate over
those questions. His answers were immediate. "What is he doing? This old
villager's question -- and he is meditating?"</p><p>For half an hour he meditated, and then he opened his eyes and he
said, "Then I can say only one thing: love and then whatsoever you do is
right."</p><p>Remember love. Love is the quintessence of the whole of religion, the
very perfume of all the flowers that have bloomed in the name of
religion -- Buddha, Krishna, Christ, Mohammed, Zarathustra, Lao Tzu,
Kabir, Farid, Nanak, Meera -</p><p>- all the flowers in all the ages that have ever bloomed, they have
the same fragrance and that fragrance is love.</p><p>If you can love, then everything is allowed -- because a loving man
cannot do anything wrong. Love is the only commandment. If love is not
there, then even</p><p>those ten commandments are not going to help at all. Ten commandments
are not needed; they are needed only because you are not ready to
fulfill the first and the only commandment.</p><p>Those ten commandments are just poor substitutes for the single
commandment: love.</p><p>And remember, love AND THEN whatsoever you do is good, is
virtuous.</p><p>That's what I go on saying in different ways: surrender and then do
your own thing.</p><p>Listening to me you can misunderstand, because doing your own thing
has become the very flavour of the new generation. I am not saying the
same thing. When I say do your own thing, I am not repeating a hippie
slogan. When I am saying do your own thing, there is a condition
preceding it: surrender, trust, AND THEN.… Otherwise, what are you going
to do? Without surrender whatsoever you do will come out of your ego,
will come out of your unconsciousness, will come out of your past. It
CAN'T come from God, and it can't come from a conscious, alert
being.</p><p>And whatsoever comes from the unconscious is going to create more and
more misery for you and for others. There is enough misery; there is no
need for you to contribute more to it. There is more than enough. If you
want to contribute something to it, please, first fulfill the basic
requirement of surrender and trust.</p><p>Just meditate for a moment... if the ego is not there, then who is
doing? Then God is doing through you, then you are just a hollow bamboo.
On his lips you become a flute --</p><p>the song is his. And then you will not feel so puzzled, Varidhi.</p><p>You say: SLOWLY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING AND</p><p>SOMETIMES IT FEELS VERY GOOD.</p><p>You are going really mighty slow. You say: SLOWLY IT SEEMS TO ME...
How can it seem slowly? Either you see it instantly, or you don't see it
-- what do you mean by</p><p>'slowly'? These things are not gradual. These things are
breakthroughs, sudden, like lightning in the dark night.</p><p>When I say something, if you are available in that moment, if you are
in tune with me in that moment, there will be a lightning experience. A
tremendous yes will arise in your heart... a flood of a new vision, of a
new clarity, of a new transparency. You will see what is what, and in
that very seeing, that which is wrong drops out of your hands -- and
only the wrong has to be dropped; the right is always there. It cannot
be dropped; it is only covered by the wrong. The wrong is a foreign
element, the right is your natural being.</p><p>You say: SLOWLY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING...</p><p>No, it cannot happen slowly. It never happens slowly. If you listen
to me you are bound to experience it, that you don't know anything at
all. What do you know? I am not talking about engineering and medicine
and geography and history; I am not talking about all that nonsense --
utilitarian nonsense. But what do you know of reality, of truth, of God,
of love, of meditation? What do you know about this mysterious existence
that surrounds you? What do you know about yourself? -- with whom you
have lived from eternity and you are going to live for eternity. What do
you know about the person who you are?</p><p>When a great mathematician, P. D. Ouspensky, went to see a very
strange mystic, George Gurdjieff, Ouspensky was already world-famous,
and Gurdjieff was not known at all; nobody had heard about him.
Ouspensky had already written one of the greatest books in the world,
TERTIUM ORGANUM. It is said that there are only three great books in the
world: the first was written by Aristotle, Organum, and the second was
written by Bacon, NOVUM ORGANUM, and the third was written by P. D.
Ouspensky, TERTIUM</p><p>ORGANUM. First principle, second principle, third principle -- third
canon of thought, that is the meaning of Tertium Organum</p><p>Ouspensky declared in the beginning of the book that the third
existed even before the first ever existed. And it is NOT just pride, it
is not just ego -- it is true. He had discovered something of immense
value; he had contributed to the world of mathematics, logic,
metaphysics, something really valuable. He was known all over the world;
the book was being translated into many many languages.</p><p>And Gurdjieff was not known at all -- just a small group of people
knew about him. And it was not easy to approach him either; he was not
available publicly. Ouspensky had great difficulties and had to wait
three months to see him, and had to try many people because only those
who belonged to the inner circle of Gurdjieff were allowed to bring some
new guest.</p><p>And the day he was ushered into the presence of Gurdjieff, twelve
people were sitting there. Gurdjieff in the middle and all the twelve
surrounding him, and there was absolute silence. And the man who had
brought Ouspensky, he also sat there and closed his eyes.</p><p>Now, Ouspensky started feeling very restless; he was not even
introduced. He started feeling a little embarrassed too: "What is he
doing here? And what are these people doing here, just sitting
silently?"</p><p>Half an hour passed... and now it was almost one hour passing.
Ouspensky started thinking, "What am I sitting here for?" But he could
not even leave, because it looked so impolite to disturb the silence.
The silence was so tangible, like a cloud the silence was sitting
there.</p><p>And then Gurdjieff looked at Ouspensky, and he said, "You are feeling
very restless. It is natural -- you come from a restless world, you
don't know the ways of silence. Why did you want to see me? Why have you
been haunting me for three months?"</p><p>And Ouspensky said, "I wanted to ask you a few questions." Gurdjieff
gave him a blank sheet of paper and told him, "Go into the other room
and on the one side write whatsoever you know, and on the other side
whatsoever you don't know. And then come back -- because I will answer
only that which you don't know. If you already know it, why bother about
it?"</p><p>It was a cold Moscow night, the snow was falling, and Ouspensky
remembers, "Going into the other room, I started perspiring. For the
first time, with such emphasis, I was made aware that I know nothing. I
wanted to write something, just to save my prestige, that I know this,
that. I thought it over, round and round, but basically I knew nothing.
I thought: Do I know anything about love? I have heard much, I have read
much -- but any experience? because that man is not going to let it pass
easily. He will ask, 'Any experience?' " And he had seen those eyes
which can go to the very core of your being:</p><p>"You cannot deceive that man.</p><p>"Do I know anything about meditation? Do I know anything about God?
Do I know anything of any real significance?'</p><p>He waited and waited and he could not find anything. And finally he
came out and gave the paper back -- as blank as before -- and said,
"Excuse me, I don't know anything. I know nothing. I have been a fool up
to now. I had always believed that I knew this and I knew that. You have
shattered me in a single blow."</p><p>Gurdjieff looked at Ouspensky, and his eyes were those of
benediction. He said, "Then you are accepted -- because only those who
know that they know not can be accepted in my circle, because only they
are capable of learning."</p><p>Varidhi, know that you know nothing -- and don't go slowly. It is not
a question of gradual discovery: it is a sudden lightning experience.
EACH morning I am trying to show it to you, shouting at you that you
don't know anything -- anything that is of any relevance, anything that
is of any value, anything that is really going to transform you,
anything that you will be able to carry beyond death to the other
shore.</p><p>But Varidhi says: SLOWLY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING</p><p>AND SOMETIMES IT FEELS VERY GOOD.</p><p>Even that -- a little glimpse, a gradual thing, just a little... as
if a window opens and closes, but a little breeze comes in, or a ray of
the sun -- still THAT feels good! If it feels good, go deeper into it,
go deeper into ignorance, go deeper into not knowing, go deeper and
deeper into a state where knowledgeability is just garbage. And great
will be your experience -- of great joy and freedom, because knowledge
is a bondage, borrowed knowledge is a bondage. One's own experience is
not knowledge: it is wisdom, it is freedom.</p><p>And finally you say: BUT STILL I WANT TO KNOW.</p><p>That's good! Start from the state of not knowing and you will become
capable of knowing. Start from the clean slate and let God write
something on it. Efface all that you know. Before God, be just nude,
innocent, ignorant, a child. And YOU</p><p>WILL know. We are here to know, but that knowing does not come
through scriptures, that knowing comes through silence. And the
knowledgeable mind cannot be silent. It is so full of knowledge, so full
of thoughts, it cannot empty itself.</p><p>Empty yourself, Varidhi. Empty yourself of all knowledge, dreams and
desires. Throw all this rotten furniture out of yourself. Create a pure
space, and in that pure space you become capable of attracting the
ultimate towards you; you become a magnetic force.</p><p>You become the host, and God comes as a guest. The fourth
question</p><p>Question 4</p><p>OSHO, FEELING A RAPIDLY GROWING UNEASINESS ABOUT MY STATE AS A
NON-SANNYASIN. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU: WHAT IS YOUR ART? HOW</p><p>COULD YOU FIND THE LOOPHOLES IN MY MIND SO EASILY AND IN WHAT</p><p>WAY DID YOU BYPASS MY WELL-DEVELOPED EGO? WHEN I ARRIVED TEN</p><p>DAYS AGO I FELT RATHER BALANCED, GRATEFUL, YES, FOR WHAT YOU</p><p>HAD SHOWN ME ALREADY, BUT NEVERTHELESS FULL OF COURAGE TO</p><p>FACE AND RESIST ANY UNTIMELY ATTEMPT THAT WOULD SANNYASIN</p><p>ME. BUT LOOK AT ME NOW: WANDERING AROUND IN THE ASHRAM OFF-BALANCE,
EYES FULL OF AWE, CRYING TIME AND AGAIN AT COMPLETELY</p><p>UNPREDICTABLE MOMENTS AND SHOWING ALL THE SIGNS OF ONE</p><p>WHO IS</p><p>IN LOVE. OSHO, I LOVE YOU, SO WHAT CAN I DO? AND HOW DID YOU</p><p>MANAGE?</p><p>Hein Kray,</p><p>I WILL TELL YOU ONE STORY -- that's how I manage, that's my art.</p><p>Haggarty ran a red light and ploughed headlong into a car driven by
Father Cogan. The auto turned over three times and the priest thrown
from the vehicle lay stunned beside the road.</p><p>Haggarty rushed over and said, "I am terribly sorry, Father!" "Saints
above!" said the shaken priest. "You almost killed me!"</p><p>"Here," said Haggarty, "I have got a little sacramental Jack Daniels.
Take some and you will feel a lot better!"</p><p>Father Cogan took a couple of large swigs and continued his tirade.
"What were you thinking about, man? You nearly launched me into
eternity!"</p><p>"I am sorry, Father," said Haggarty. "Take a few more sips, it will
ease your nerves."</p><p>After the priest had almost finished the entire bottle, he said, "Why
don't you have a drink?"</p><p>"No thanks, your reverence," said Haggarty, "I will just sit here and
wait for the police!"</p><p>So I am just waiting till the day, which is coming closer and
closer... it is the nineteenth of April that you are going to be
assassinated.</p><p>Something really beautiful is happening to you. All that ego that
seems so strong is not so strong; it is just your belief that keeps it
alive. Once you start understanding, it starts dying. It is all kinds of
inhibitions that keep your tears</p><p>repressed. You have been told again and again that you are not a
woman, you are a man -- be a boy, don't be a girl.</p><p>Crying and weeping is for girls, not for you.</p><p>Nature has not made any distinction: there are as many tear glands in
male eyes as there are in female eyes. Tears are needed; tears do
miracles. But repressing the tears is a subtle strategy to repress
emotions. Tears are deep down connected with the heart. Heads don't cry,
only hearts. Repressing the tears is a subtle trick to repress the
heart.</p><p>You have lived in the head, high and proud, thinking your ego very
strong. Now you have fallen in a wrong company... these are mad people
here. Anybody can start crying any moment! Crying is thought to be
sacred here, because tears come directly from the heart. There is no
other prayer which is more beautiful than tears.</p><p>And it is not that tears come only when you are in suffering, pain
and sadness. That too is a wrong idea that has been given to you -- that
tears come only when you are in pain. No.</p><p>Tears come whenever anything is overflowing -- it may be pain, it may
be pleasure, it may be agony, it may be ecstasy -- anything overflowing.
Tears are symbols of something overflowing.</p><p>And, Kray, something wants to overflow, something wants to burst
forth. You have repressed a long long time all that is beautiful. Now,
being in my Buddhafield, it is impossible to remain in your senses; it
is impossible NOT to fall in love. You don't have a heart of stone; you
have a heart which is beating with God, full of love -- repressed, but
ready to burst forth any moment, waiting for its opportunity. And that
opportunity has come.</p><p>Sannyas is a new way of life, a new style, a new philosophy -- to
live totally: with tears, with smiles, with love, with laughter, with
anger, with hate, with compassion -- to live in all the dimensions of
the mind, being, and to live totally. And the miracle is that if you
live totally, slowly slowly, all that is negative starts disappearing of
its own accord. And finally, ultimately, only that which has always been
called virtue remains; the evil evaporates.</p><p>No repression is recommended, no suppression is supported. I teach
you to be</p><p>natural, and that's why you have fallen in love with me. It is really
an indirect way of falling in love with your own nature -- I am just an
excuse. Just go on sipping a little more, only three days are left.
Empty the bottle, so the day you take sannyas, or as you say...</p><p>I WAS FULL OF COURAGE TO FACE AND RESIST ANY UNTIMELY ATTEMPT</p><p>THAT WOULD SANNYASIN ME. You can call it 'sannyasinate', and that
will be far better, because it is an assassination. Drink as much as you
can so the death is not painful.</p><p>Drink of me as much as you can before your sannyas happens, so that
it REALLY</p><p>happens. And it is going to happen really, because you had not come
to be a sannyasin.</p><p>You had come with all kinds of resistances; you were afraid that it
might happen untimely. You wanted to take it by your own decision, in
your own time.</p><p>Whenever one becomes a sannyasin by his own decision, in his own
time, he misses the whole point. Let it be a happening, not a doing on
your part. Surrender cannot be done: it can only be gratefully accepted.
And that's what is happening. You are fortunate, you are blessed.</p><p>The fifth question Question 5</p><p>WHY AM I SO MUCH AFRAID OF HELL?</p><p>Dhara,</p><p>THERE IS NO NEED TO BE AFRAID OF HELL, because there are many
hells</p><p>-- and there is an Indian hell too. And everybody is asked at the
gate, "Which hell do you want to choose?" Choose the Indian, and you
will be happy ever afterwards.</p><p>Fellow dies and is met by Saint Peter at the Gate. "Before you can
get in you</p><p>must spend six months in hell. You have a choice: either the regular
hell or the Indian hell."</p><p>"What is the difference?" asked the fellow.</p><p>"In the regular hell," explained Saint Peter, "they tie you to a
stake, pour gasoline over you, strike the match, and you burn for twelve
hours and then you rest for twelve hours."</p><p>"And the Indian hell?"</p><p>"They tie you to a stake, pour gasoline over you, set you on fire and
you burn for twelve hours and then rest for twelve hours."</p><p>"But I don't see the difference," said the man.</p><p>"If I were you," advised Saint Peter, "I would take the Indian hell
-- somebody usually forgets the matches or the gasoline..."</p><p>So you need not be so much afraid -- wise people always choose the
Indian hell. But, Dhara, I can understand why you are afraid. Fear is a
natural instinct in man, and it has been exploited by the priests down
the ages. Fear and greed are two sides of the same coin, and they have
exploited both.</p><p>It is out of fear that they have created hell, just to exploit your
fear instinct. If you can be made really afraid then you will be in the
hands of the priests. Or if you can be made really very greedy for
heaven, then too you will be in the hands of the priests. The priests
have been telling you that "We will protect you from hell and we will
help you to enter into heaven. All that you need is just to remain
obedient to us.</p><p>And because of fear and greed, man has remained obedient to the
priests. Parents have used... that's how everybody is brought up, in
fear and greed. If you do one thing, you are punished; if you do
something else, you are rewarded. It is the SAME story -- in the school,
college, university, the same story repeated, again and again: punished
for something, rewarded for something else. It is greed and fear which
are being enforced again and again.</p><p>By the time you come from the university, you have been conditioned,
totally conditioned. Your whole life is going to remain the same if you
don't become</p><p>alert, if you don't become aware of the whole situation, if you don't
gather courage to get out of the prison that has been made by the
society for you. That prison consists of greed and fear.</p><p>There is no hell! regular or Indian. And there is no heaven either.
Hell and heaven are psychological states, not geographical situations.
Forget all about that childish nonsense.</p><p>You can be in hell right now, or in heaven right now. And the only
way to be in heaven is to be without mind, and the only way to be in
hell is to be only the mind and nothing else.</p><p>The constant traffic of thoughts is your misery. If this traffic
disappears and you are left silent, alone, with no thought surrounding
you, in that moment of peace and silence and stillness YOU ARE in heaven
-- you are heaven! That's what meditation is all about.</p><p>Dhara, you need not be worried, need not be afraid of any heaven or
hell. You just meditate, become more and more silent, become more and
more detached from the mind, become more and more disidentified from
your thought process. Just be a witness! Go on witnessing whatsoever
passes in the mind, and the very process of witnessing has the whole
secret in it. Slowly slowly, you will see less and less thoughts are
coming to you, because you are no more welcoming them, and because you
don't care, and because you don't cling, and because you don't choose
this against that, and because you are no more judgemental. Good
thoughts, bad thoughts, all are alike. Great thoughts, small thoughts,
all are alike. You remain aloof, distant, a watcher on the hill.</p><p>Slowly slowly, less and less traffic... and one day suddenly
intervals start happening. An interval for a few seconds, and you will
have a taste of the unknown. And once you have tasted something of
no-mind, your real life begins. Then all is joy, then all is
benediction.</p><p>But to be meditative, great intelligence is needed. You can't go on
being the way you are, you can't go on being stupid. You have to be very
alert!</p><p>Towards the end of World War II, when the Italians were fighting the
Germans, the Nazi soldiers came up with a scheme to kill many of
Mussolini's men. They simply yelled,</p><p>"Hey, Luigi!" When an Italian infantryman stuck his head up and
answered, "Si?" boom!</p><p>He was dead.</p><p>That's all the Krauts did: "Luigi?" "Si?" Boom!</p><p>After thousands of Italians had been wiped out, they decided to
retaliate. They figured that every German's name was Hans. So an Italian
captain shouted, "Hey, Hans!"</p><p>Silence.</p><p>"Hey, Hans!" he repeated. "Is that you, Luigi?" "Si!"</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The sixth question Question 6</p><p>WHY IS THE MODERN MAN FEELING SO LONELY?</p><p>Dhammo,</p><p>MAN HAS ALWAYS FELT LONELY, because man basically IS alone. We are
born alone, and we will die alone. And in the middle we can only pretend
to be together.</p><p>Aloneness remains unaffected. It becomes an undercurrent, it goes
underground.</p><p>Man has always been alone, but modern man is feeling it more for a
certain reason --</p><p>because modern man for the first time has time enough to think about
his own self. In the past, the struggle for bread and butter was so much
that it kept people occupied from the early morning to the late night,
and then too they were not able to feed themselves and their children
enough.</p><p>And that's exactly the case in the East even today. Modern man in an
Indian village is not feeling lonely. He has no time to feel anything at
all! He feels hungry, not lonely; he needs a shelter, a house. These
things -- feelings of loneliness -- he cannot afford. These feelings
start surfacing only when a society becomes a little affluent.</p><p>When people are well-fed, well-clothed, well-sheltered, well-employed
-- when the ordinary necessities of life are fulfilled, then the real
problems of life arise. Then one suddenly becomes aware that "I am
lonely, even in the crowd I am lonely." This is a higher need. There is
a hierarchy of needs.</p><p>First physical needs come. If physical needs are not fulfilled, you
will not have psychological needs. Once physical needs are fulfilled,
then psychological needs arise --</p><p>those are higher. One thinks of music, poetry, painting; one thinks
of art, aesthetics --</p><p>those are higher needs. One thinks of Shakespeare, Milton, Kali Das,
Rabindranath, Kahlil Gibran; one thinks of Wagner, Beethoven, Leonardo,
Van Gogh, Picasso These are higher needs.</p><p>A hungry man cannot understand Beethoven. Howsoever great the music
is, it cannot fill his stomach. And he is so hungry that he would like
to kill the musician rather than listen to the music. He will not bother
about great works of art; rather, he will be interested in Karl Marx and
his Communist Manifesto. Once physical needs are fulfilled,
psychological needs arise.</p><p>You will be surprised to know: I receive many letters from Soviet
Russia. They cannot even write to me directly, because then those
letters will never come. First the Russian government and then the
Indian government.… If there were only the Indian government there would
be a chance. But the Russian government and they are very methodical. So
those letters are given to visitors,</p><p>tourists, to Switzerland, and then those letters are dropped in
London or in Berlin or in Paris, then they come to me.</p><p>Many people write that they would like to come here, but it is
impossible. My books are being read, but in an underground way. They are
circulating from one person to another...</p><p>but officially you cannot carry my books in a communist country.</p><p>Russia is coming closer and closer to that point where physical needs
are fulfilled, and psychological needs will arise, and spiritual needs
are the highest in the hierarchy. Once psychological needs are fulfilled
-- you have heard great music, you have seen great paintings, you have
read great poetry -- then what? Sooner or later, those things also prove
to be games, beautiful games, but games all the same.</p><p>Then the ultimate starts knocking on your doors, and when the
ultimate knocks on your doors you feel REALLY LONELY, lonely in this
whole universe. And that is the beginning of meditation. If you feel
lonely and if your feeling of loneliness has some penetration,
intensity, passion in it, then you start meditating.</p><p>Meditation is a way to come to terms with one's loneliness, to have
an encounter with one's own loneliness rather than escaping from it,
diving deep into it and seeing what exactly it is. And then you are in
for a surprise. If you go into your loneliness you will be surprised: at
the very center of it it is not lonely at all -- there resides aloneness
which is a totally different phenomenon.</p><p>The circumference consists of loneliness and the center consists of
aloneness. The circumference consists of solitariness and the center of
solitude. And once you have known your beautiful aloneness, you will be
a totally different person -</p><p>- you will never feel lonely. Even in the mountains or in the deserts
where you will be absolutely alone, you will not feel lonely -- because
in your aloneness you will know God is with you, in your aloneness you
are so deeply rooted in God that who cares whether there is somebody
else outside or not? You are so full inside, so rich inside.…</p><p>Right now, even in the crowd you are lonely. And I am saying: if you
know your aloneness, even in your loneliness you will not be lonely.</p><p>But modern man IS suffering...</p><p>Ira quit college, got himself a backpack and began hitchhiking around
the United States.</p><p>After he had been gone more than a year, he telephoned home. "Hello,
Ma. How are you?"</p><p>"Just fine, son. When are you coming home? I will fix you some
chopped liver and chicken soup and a beautiful pot roast.</p><p>"I am still pretty far away."</p><p>"Oh, son," cried the desperate woman, "just come home and I will fix
your favourite oatmeal cookies."</p><p>"I don't like oatmeal cookies!" said the boy. "You don't?" asked the
woman.</p><p>"Say," said Ira, "is this Century 57682?" "No!"</p><p>"Then I must have the wrong number."</p><p>"Does that mean you are not coming?" asked the woman.</p><p>People are really lonely. The woman asked, "Does that mean you are
not coming?" Man has never been so lonely because man has never been
able to fulfill the lower desires, needs before. For the first time in
the West, man has been able to fulfill all lower desires; now the higher
desires are asserting themselves. This is a good sign. It looks like a
curse -</p><p>- it is not -- it is a blessing in disguise.</p><p>The days of the West turning East have come. The misery is that the
East is turning West.</p><p>Man seems to be so foolish. By the time the West turns East, you will
find the East has become West. And this way the sorry-go-round
continues.…</p><p>You can see it here. Why don't you see so many Indians here? This is
not their need.</p><p>What I am sharing here has nothing to do with them. The desire for it
has not yet arisen.</p><p>Even when sometimes they come, they don't ask about meditation, they
don't ask</p><p>about sannyas, they don't ask about love -- no, not at all.</p><p>Just the other day I received a letter saying, "Why don't you open a
few hospitals, a few schools...? Why don't you teach your sannyasins to
serve the poor?" The poor have been served down the ages and they are
still poor. Poverty cannot be destroyed by serving the poor -- that much
is absolutely certain. Poverty can be destroyed only if a new vision of
life is given to them. They are poor because their philosophy makes them
poor; they are poor because their very attitude towards life keeps them
poor. They are poor BECAUSE</p><p>of themselves! They don't need compassion: they need education. They
don't need service: they need to be shaken into awareness. But nobody
wants to be shaken out of their own dreams and sleep. Hence they are
angry at me.</p><p>Hospitals are there; a few more can be added. Schools are there; a
few more can be added. But that is NOT going to help. That is like
throwing colour with teaspoons into the ocean: it is not going to colour
the ocean.</p><p>We have to change the whole fundamental. Why has India remained so
poor for so many centuries? The reason must be very deep. The reason is
that the Indian mind is life-negative. The reason is that the Indian
mind lives in a division: this world and that. The reason is that the
Indian mind is against materialism. If you are against materialism you
will remain poor, and that is your own decision; then it is your own
fate decided by you yourself.</p><p>A real spirituality has to be based on scientific materialism. Matter
and consciousness are not two things, just as body and consciousness are
not two things -- aspects of one phenomenon. This world has to be loved,
Then this world yields, gives its secrets to you.</p><p>The West has committed one mistake, that there is no spiritualism,
only materialism is enough. So their basic needs are fulfilled, but the
higher needs are torturing them, making them commit suicide or go mad.
And the East has committed the other mistake: that spiritualism can
exist without materialism, so the East has become like a ghost, a soul
without a body. The West is a body without a soul, a corpse: and the
East is a ghost, a soul without a body.</p><p>My effort here is to somehow bring East and West closer and closer,
so everybody can have a body and everybody can have a soul. Materialism
and spiritualism should be two aspects of one life vision. Then the
poverty will</p><p>disappear. The earth is rich enough, and man's intelligence is there
-- we can make it even richer.</p><p>But you don't see Indians here, not many, very few. Those few are
those who are intelligent enough to see that even if lower desires are
fulfilled, nothing will be fulfilled.</p><p>Those few are born in the East, but they are really contemporary,
they are modern. They have seen what has happened in the West. And even
if India becomes rich, this is going to happen: the West is not happy;
even if India becomes rich it is not going to be happy either. So
happiness has to be searched for in some other dimension.</p><p>That dimension is: entering your loneliness till you come upon
aloneness. The first glimpse of aloneness is satori. The second glimpse,
the second satori: you become established in your aloneness, rooted. And
the third, the ultimate satori, what we call samadhi in India, is the
state when you are no more separate from your aloneness -- you ARE your
aloneness.</p><p>And then one starts overflowing like a fountain. Out of that
aloneness arises the fragrance of love, and out of that aloneness arises
creativity -- because oUt of that aloneness God starts flowing. You
become a hollow bamboo... he starts singing. But the song is always
his.</p><p>The Fish in the Sea is Not Thirsty Chapter #7</p><p>Chapter title: It is Morning Swan, Wake Up! 17 April 1979 am in

OUT OF IT,</p><p>BEFORE GARDENS AND AFTER GARDENS.</p><p>MAN IS AWAKE AND YET NOT AWAKE. His wakefulness is very thin, his
wakefulness is almost of no use. He is not asleep, that is true, but he
is not awake either --</p><p>he is in limbo, in the middle. He has awakened from the world of
animals, but he is fast asleep to the world of gods.</p><p>Man is a transitory period. Man is not a being but a becoming -- on
the way. The past is left behind and the future is not attained yet.
Hence the agony, the anguish: man is torn apart. The past pulls him
back. To be an animal again seems to be pleasant, and it is, because it
has not the agony of man and the anguish and the anxiety of man.</p><p>If you watch the animals you will feel jealous. Walt Whitman has
written it exactly in his diaries that: "Whenever I see animals, I feel
jealous. We have missed something."</p><p>We have not missed really, but the peace, the calm, the collectedness
of the animal is lost.</p><p>The animal is happy because he is unaware -- unaware of death,
unaware of the problems of life. The animal is happy because there is no
consciousness. Consciousness first brings pain, because suddenly you
become aware of a thousand and one problems facing you.</p><p>You have to encounter them, you have to solve them or dissolve them.
All peace disappears.</p><p>But human consciousness is still worthwhile. And I don't agree with
Walt Whitman, I agree with Socrates who say.: "I would like to be a
discontented Socrates rather than a contented pig." The statement of
Socrates is of immense value. It has to be understood by every seeker,
because the goal is ahead; there is no going back. The pig may look
contented -- because he is not aware, not really because he is
contented. But to know discontent one needs consciousness.</p><p>There is something ahead; something more has to happen. Something HAS
happened, but only partially. Look back and you find the pig contented;
look ahead, and you see Buddhas contented. You can become a Buddha! A
Buddha means one who is conscious and contented. The pig is one who is
unconscious and contented. And the man is just between the two: a little
bit conscious, just a little bit. Conscious enough to be aware of the
pain of life and the misery and the suffering, but not conscious enough
to be aware of the ecstasies that life makes available.</p><p>Just a little consciousness is enough to be aware of pain. But much
more awareness is needed, much more consciousness is needed, to be aware
of the deeper realms of your inner kingdom.</p><p>Man is in a kind of drunkenness: awake and yet not awake. Man sees a
little bit, and yet everything seems to be dark, just shadows moving in
the dark are felt. But nothing is absolutely clear; there is no clarity,
no transparency, no light.</p><p>This is the state of man. And we cannot go back because there is no
possibility of going back. Man tries hard to go back -- through sex,
through food, through alcohol, through drugs -- man tries somehow to
drown this little bit of consciousness that has arisen in him. But it
comes back again and again, because whatsoever has been Learnt has been
learnt for ever -- it cannot be unlearnt.</p><p>It has happened in your being. Now there is no way to discard it. You
have to live with it.</p><p>The only possibility is to move ahead, to grow more into awareness:
if it has brought pain, then go deep into pain, but become more and more
aware. Use pain as an object of awareness, as an object of
meditation.</p><p>You are sad -- be aware. Let sadness become your meditation. You are
angry -- be aware.</p><p>You are in love -- be aware. Use all possibilities, all opportunities
to be more and more aware. Slowly slowly, the momentum gathers, and one
day something explodes in you.</p><p>That explosion is known in the East as the flowering of the
one-thousand- petalled lotus --</p><p>Kabir will talk about this lotus in these sutras. And Kabir is
talking about you; first a few metaphors have to be understood.</p><p>The swan is one of the metaphors most used by the Eastern mystics.
The swan lives beyond the Himalayas, his home is beyond the Himalayas,
in the Lake Mansarovar. The Lake Mansarovar is the purest lake in the
world -- very rarely does a human being reach there -- uncontaminated,
unpolluted, surrounded by the Himalayan beauty, virgin peaks.</p><p>The swan is born there, lives there, but when it becomes TOO cold the
swan has to come to this side of the Himalayas, to the plains. And
sometimes it happens: a swan forgets the way to go back. And sometimes
it happens: a swan simply forgets that he has a home somewhere, starts
living by the side of dirty rivers, dirty ponds, muddy places.</p><p>Hence, the swan became a tremendously potent metaphor for man. Man
comes from God but has forgotten from where he comes, who he is. Man
comes from God, from the holiest of the holies, and goes on living by
the side of dirty rivers, muddy pools of water.</p><p>Of course, he cannot be contented here, but he knows no other place
to go. He is lost.</p><p>This world seems to be the only world.</p><p>The Eastern mystics use the metaphor of the swan for man. Kabir says:
HANSA KARO PURATAN BAT.</p><p>Swan, it would be good if we remember</p><p>the primordial days,</p><p>the days when you had not left the home yet. It would be good if we
remember the home.</p><p>SWAN, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL ME YOUR WHOLE STORY!</p><p>Tell me your whole story! But if somebody asks you what story you
have to tell, birth seems to be the beginning -- which it is not -- and
death seems to be the end</p><p>-- which it is not. Birth and death, both are episodes in your long
life, and they have happened millions of times.</p><p>The true story can begin only when you remember your real home, from
where you come. And the real story can never end, because the real story
is not only your story -- it is the story of consciousness, of evolving
consciousness, of evolution. It is not only your story -- it is God's
story. There is no beginning and there is no end.</p><p>Once you become full of this nostalgia for the origins, then you will
be surprised that you have become aware of the goal too -- because the
origin is the goal, the source is the goal.</p><p>We have to go to the same space from where we come, then the circle
is perfect. And in that perfection is beauty, in that perfection is
blessing, that perfection is benediction.</p><p>SWAN, I'D LIKE YOU TO TELL ME YOUR WHOLE STORY!</p><p>ONLY A BUDDHA CAN TELL HIS WHOLE STORY, only one who has</p><p>become totally awakened. You can talk about your dreams, but that is
not your story. You are dreaming, desiring, thinking, but you know
nothing. And the less you know, the more you believe in your dreams --
because one has to keep oneself occupied. The less you know, the more
you desire -- just to avoid your inner ignorance and emptiness. You rush
in all directions; you go on rushing, you don't give yourself a little
rest, because the lest seems to be explosive, dangerous.</p><p>And rest is meditation. Finding at least one or two hours out of the
hustle and bustle of life, sitting silently doing nothing, you may start
moving inwards, you</p><p>may start remembering something, the origins -- because deep down the
memory of where you come from is still there. You may have forgotten it
but it is there, maybe covered with rubbish, all kinds of rubbish, but
that rubbish can be removed.</p><p>That's what meditation is all about: removing the rubbish -- of
thoughts, memories, dreams, desires, imaginations. And if you can remove
all this rubbish that your head has gathered, your heart will start
remembering. And once the source is remembered, the goal is known --
because, let me repeat, the source is the goal. We have to reach the
same place from where we come.</p><p>SWAN, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL ME YOUR WHOLE STORY!</p><p>The original has some beauty in it:</p><p>HANSA KARO PURATAN BAT --</p><p>Let us talk of the old days, swan.</p><p>Let us remember the old days, the ancient days. Let us remember the
beginnings.</p><p>Let us talk again about the source.</p><p>And Kabir is talking to his disciples, remember. He is calling his
disciples swans</p><p>-- HANSA.</p><p>WHERE YOU FIRST APPEARED, AND WHAT DARK SAND YOU ARE GOING
TOWARD...</p><p>"From where do you come, and to where are you going? Let us be very
particular about it." That is the work of a Master: to remind the
disciple from where he comes and to where he is going. Otherwise, people
go on moving with the crowd... wherever others are going. People remain
imitators; people remain just followers, followers of the blind -- the
blind following the blind.</p><p>Your parents were following their parents, you are follow-ing your
parents, your children will follow you -- and nobody knows from where
you come and where you are going.</p><p>And everybody is trying... not at all aware of what really your need
is, what is going to fulfill you. More money? More houses? More power?
Are these things going to help?</p><p>Have they helped others?</p><p>Just be a little more observant. There is an ancient story: The last
initiation was going to be given to the disciple. The Master said, "Your
last initiation will be given in a very indirect way." The disciple had
passed all the hurdles that the Master had put in his way; he had proved
his mettle. Now the last initiation... and once he has passed the last
initiation, he will be declared enlightened The disciple touched the
feet of the Master and said, "I am ready. Just order me and I will do
whatsoever needs to be done."</p><p>The Master said, "You will have to go to the King, and go early in
the morning; be the first visitor to the King. Because the King has a
habit: whosoever comes to him first, whatsoever he asks, the King gives.
But the country is so rich that it is very rare that anybody goes. Years
pass and nobody goes to ask for anything. But don't take any chances --
be there very early. The King comes in the morning into his garden, as
the sun rises the King enters the garden -- be there. And he will ask
you, 'What do you want?'</p><p>And whatsoever you want, ask him."</p><p>The disciple could not understand what kind of initiation this last
one was. But the order had to be followed. He went. He didn't take any
chance: three o'clock early in the morning he was waiting for the
King.</p><p>As the sun was rising, the King entered. The young man bowed down to
the King; the King said, "Have you come to ask for something? You can
ask for anything! Whatsoever you ask, I will give it to you."</p><p>A great desire possessed the young man. He was a poor man, had come
from a very poor family, "And the King says whatsoever...?" To be
certain, he asked again, "What do you mean by 'whatsoever'?"</p><p>The King said, "Exactly that I mean -- whatsoever. Even if you demand
my kingdom I will give it to you. You can ask for as much money as you
want..."</p><p>The poor young man could not think much. He thought, "Maybe ten
thousand rupees will do." But a desire came that "Why ten thousand? You
may never get such a chance again -</p><p>- why not one hundred thousand?"</p><p>And then another desire, and desires upon desires... because mind
constantly asks for more. So whatsoever he decided, the mind was still
asking for more.</p><p>The King said, "It seems you are not yet ready to ask. I will go for
my morning walk, meanwhile you decide. And when I return, whatsoever you
ask will be given to you."</p><p>That half an hour was a torture. He went on and on, "I can ask for
this and that, and a golden chariot, and so many millions of rupees, and
so much land -- I will create a small kingdom of my own."</p><p>Desires and dreams... and the King came; that half hour had passed so
fast. The King was standing there and he said, "Young man, have you not
decided yet?"</p><p>And then suddenly the young man thought, "Whatsoever I ask will be
less than the King has, so why not ask for all? Be finished with the
figures!"</p><p>So he said, "Sir, if you are so willing to give, I ask for
every-thing! -- all that you have.</p><p>Your whole kingdom, all your riches, your palaces -- everything. You
simply get out of the palace! And you cannot go back in. You may take
something. You simply get out --</p><p>forget all about it. I can allow you only these clothes that you are
wearing." Even that he did reluctantly; even that much he would have
less.</p><p>The King fell on his knees, started praying to God, tears rolling
down from his eyes -- of great joy, ecstasy! And he was thanking God
saying "I have been waiting for such a man.</p><p>How long I waited! But finally you heard my prayer, and now he has
come and I am free of all this nonsense. Thank you! You heard my prayer,
although it has been so long and I had to wait so long, but still you
heard it. I am grateful."</p><p>When he was saying these things to God, the young man was standing
there and he started thinking, "What is the matter? If this man is
feeling so happy renouncing the kingdom, what am I getting into? If this
man has been praying for thirty years, as he is saying, 'Send a man who
can take my whole kingdom, who can ask for my whole kingdom!' -- if for
thirty years he has been praying, then it is not worthwhile at all. I am
getting into unnecessary trouble."</p><p>He also fell on his knees, touched the King's feet and said, "Sir, I
am a young man -- I am a young fool. Please excuse me. I don't want
anything. Your prayer to God, your thankfulness to God has finished my
whole mind. I am going back to the forest to my Master."</p><p>The King tried to persuade him, "Don't go. Just have a look. Come
into the palace! I will not only give you my palace, my kingdom, my
riches, but my beautiful daughter also.</p><p>Come and just have a look!"</p><p>But the young man said, "I cannot stay here, not even a single moment
-- because the mind can betray me. An insight has happened, and I am
thankful to you just as you are thankful to God. I am finished!"</p><p>And when the young man reached back to his Master and told the whole
story, the Master said, "Your last initiation is over. Now nothing will
ever make a slave of you. Now you are alert, conscious, free. You have
passed -- I am happy. I was watching from here, and when you had asked
for the whole kingdom, my heart was crying. I was thinking, 'So, fifteen
years' work on this fool, and all finished.' You can't imagine my
happiness," said the Master, "that you are back, that you could see the
point, that you were observant."</p><p>Be observant, just watch.… People HAVE money, people have great
palaces, people have all that you can desire -- just watch, just see:
are they happy? are they contented? They may be more happy than you are
and more discontented than you are -- then don't follow them. They are
blind! They have followed other blind people. Don't follow them, don't
imitate the crowd.</p><p>The really religious person is one who gets out of the entanglement
of the mass psychology, of the mass hypnosis. The mass conditions you:
rebel against it; go out of this mass conditioning, become an
individual. Then only can you re- member from where you come, because
only then will you know who you are.</p><p>Right now you know you are a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Christian.
You are not all these things: you are neither white nor black, you are
neither man nor woman -- you are just a pure consciousness with no
adjectives attached to it. There is no frame to this consciousness; this
consciousness is infinite. If you drop the mass conditionings you will
be coming closer home.</p><p>HANSA KARO PURATAN BAT --</p><p>Let us talk of those ancient times when we were at the source.</p><p>SWAN, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL ME YOUR WHOLE STORY! WHERE YOU FIRST
APPEARED, AND WHAT DARK SAND</p><p>YOU ARE GOING TOWARD...</p><p>YOU ARE COMING FROM LIGHT, SO wherever you are going you must be
going towards darkness. And that's what happens.</p><p>A child has more light in his being; as he grows he becomes darker
and darker and darker. By the time he is old he is just a dark night of
the soul and nothing else. A child is more luminous, is more
intelligent, more alert. And as time passes and dust gathers on him,
layers and layers of dust, and all his intelligence disappears, he
becomes mediocre.</p><p>He starts behaving in stupid ways, because he falls a victim to the
stupid crowd that surrounds him. He is helpless -- he has to listen to
the parents, to the teachers, to the politicians. They are the great
leaders, they are the great priests -- they know, and they all say, "We
love you. Listen to us otherwise you will go astray. Obey us, otherwise
you will go astray."</p><p>Obedience has been one of the greatest calamities that has befallen
humanity. One should be capable of disobeying. I am not saying to make
disobeying your</p><p>religion; I am simply saying one should be capable of disobeying. In
fact, the person who is capable of disobeying is also capable of
obeying. The person who is only capable of obeying, his obedience
carries no value. The person who cannot say no, his yes is always
impotent.</p><p>Only the person who can say no, his yes has power, meaning,
significance. He says yes only when he means it.</p><p>And one should be alert enough to say no to all that takes you deeper
and deeper into the mire of darkness, of blindness, of
superstitiousness. And one should be capable of saying yes to anything
that takes you towards the light, towards love, towards life. And it is
up to you! If you say yes to darkness you will be saying no to light. If
you move towards darkness you will have to keep your back towards the
light. And it is only a question of a hundred-and-eighty-degree turn
-</p><p>- a hundred-and-eighty-degree turn and you are in front of the light
that you have been searching and seeking. But your ways, your methods,
your habits, your patterns of thinking, were all taking you towards
darker and darker realms of life.</p><p>WHERE YOU FIRST APPEARED, AND WHAT DARK SAND YOU ARE GOING
TOWARD,</p><p>AND WHERE YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT...</p><p>This is a night in which you are living, and the life that you call
life is nothing but a sleep</p><p>-- full of dreams. Sometimes you even dream that you are awake; that
too is a dream.</p><p>Just the other night I was reading a story:</p><p>A man came to the lake and told the fisherman, "I am Jesus
Christ!"</p><p>The fisherman looked at him and laughed, and he said, "Jesus has been
dead for two thousand years -- are you mad or something?"</p><p>The man said, But I am Jesus Christ. Have you not heard that after he
was crucified he was resurrected -- and since then I have not died? Have
you ever</p><p>heard when Jesus died after resurrection?"</p><p>The fisherman thought, "Either he is very drunk or gone nuts." He
said, "Then you will have to prove it: Jesus did miracles...</p><p>And the man was very happy; he said, "Yes, what miracle do you want
me to do?"</p><p>The fisherman said, "Then walk on the lake."</p><p>And the madman walked... and drowned. The fisherman jumped in,
somehow pulled him out; asked him, "What happened?"</p><p>He said, "That time my shoes did not have any holes. Two thousand
years of wandering on the earth, and the shoes are full of holes --
that's what happened."</p><p>Mad people have their own logic. Blind people have their own logic.
People who are fast asleep have their own logic -- logic that supports
their sleep.</p><p>One man suddenly became certain that he was dead. There was no way to
prove that he was not, so he was taken to a psychiatrist. The
psychiatrist tried hard to convince him in every possible way, all kinds
of arguments -- but how can you prove to a man...? He said,</p><p>"But I am dead -- with whom are you talking? I am not, I am no more.
This is not a dialogue, this is a monologue -- you are talking with
yourself, you have gone mad."</p><p>Suddenly an idea struck the psychiatrist. He said, "Okay, you come
close to the mirror."</p><p>And then he brought a needle, pushed the needle into the madman's
hand -- before pushing the needle in he asked, "Do you think dead men
bleed?"</p><p>He said, "No. How can a dead man bleed?"</p><p>He pushed the needle in, blood started oozing out. The psychiatrist
was very happy and he said, "Now look!"</p><p>Do you know what the madman said? He said, "What is there to look at?
That</p><p>simply proves that dead men do bleed."</p><p>You can go on supporting your illusions -- very logically. You can go
on thinking you are awake and you can remain asleep. Kabir says:</p><p>... AND WHERE YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT, AND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING</p><p>FOR.…</p><p>Ask these questions deep down in your own heart: What are you looking
for? Where are you? Where are you asleep? In what space are you
asleep?</p><p>Rothstein owed a hundred dollars to Weiner. The debt was past due and
Rothstein was broke, so he borrowed the hundred dollars from Spivak and
paid Weiner.</p><p>A week later, Rothstein borrowed back the hundred dollars from Weiner
and paid Spivak.</p><p>Another week went by and Rothstein borrowed back the hundred dollars
from Spivak to pay Weiner.</p><p>He repeated this transaction several times, until finally he called
them up and said,</p><p>"Fellas, this is a lotta bother. Why don't you two exchange the
hundred dollars every week and keep me out of it!"</p><p>This is what is happening here, everywhere in the world. You can
learn how to keep yourself out of it, and that is the secret of
awareness. This transaction will continue; the world will remain a
marketplace -- it was so before, it will remain so afterwards too. But
you can be out of this transaction -- you can be a witness to it. You
can slip out of your identity. It is your identity where you are asleep.
It is your ego where you are asleep.</p><p>The ego means simply that the self is asleep. The moment the self
awakes, the ego disappears, is not found any more.</p><p>Andrews, a white Georgia farmer, hired Monroe, a black, to chop some
wood.</p><p>Monroe took the axe and began hacking away. But in a little while the
farmer noticed Monroe sitting in the shade, watching another negro do
the work.</p><p>"Why you sittin' there doing nothing when I am paying you to cut the
wood?" asked Andrews. "How come you got somebody else doing it?"</p><p>"I hired him to do it for me," said Monroe.</p><p>"Is that a fact," said the white man. "How much are you paying
him?"</p><p>"I am paying him a dollar and a quarter," answered Monroe. "Why would
you want to do that?" snorted the white man. "I am paying you only a
dollar!"</p><p>"I know," said the black, "but it is worth a quarter to be boss for
once."</p><p>The ego is constantly in search of being a boss -- whatsoever the
cost, at any cost. You are losing your whole opportunity of life just to
fulfill a shadowy, non- substantial notion</p><p>-- the notion of ego: "I am somebody." Nobody is nobody. We are all
one; we are not separate.</p><p>At the source we are one, at the goal we will be one again. Just in
this dark night when we have fallen asleep we are having private dreams.
Remember, the real is universal, the unreal is private. You cannot even
invite your girlfriend into your dream -- hence it is false. It is so
private you cannot share it. Anything that is so private is bound to be
false, and there is nothing more private than the ego -- and that is the
center of all your dreaming mind, sleeping mind.</p><p>And people go on wasting their whole lives, not even knowing what
they are looking for.</p><p>Do you know exactly what you are looking for? Do you have some idea?
Do you have some sense of direction?</p><p>IT IS MORNING, SWAN, SAYS Kabir, wake up, CLIMB IN THE AIR, FOLLOW
ME!</p><p>The original has something more:</p><p>AB HI HANSA CHET SABERA --</p><p>Now is the morning, swan...</p><p>NOW has to be remembered. The translation has missed something: IT IS
MORNING, SWAN, WAKE UP...</p><p>The original says: It is ALWAYS morning -- NOW wake up, because now
is the morning. The present is always light, the present is always
sunrise. Being in the past or being in the future, you go on missing the
light, the door from where light penetrates you.</p><p>AB HI HANSA CHET SABERA -- This is the door, now is the time -- now
or never!</p><p>IT IS MORNING, SWAN, WAKE UP, CLIMB IN THE AIR, FOLLOW ME!</p><p>AND ONE CAN WAKE UP ONLY IF ONE STARTS CLIMBING IN THE AIR.</p><p>This is a metaphor, a mystic metaphor. It means: you start moving
into the world of quality, not into the world of quantity. People live
in the world of quantity: more money, more power, more prestige, more
respectability. These are all quantities.</p><p>You have so much -- you can double it, treble it, you can have it
thousandfold, but it is all quantity. There is a different dimension:
the dimension of quality. For example, you can have one sex experience,
you can have two, you can have three, you can have four; then it is
quantity. But if your sex experience starts becoming more a love
experience, and your love experience starts becoming more a prayer
experience, then it is quality.</p><p>Quantity is horizontal, quality is vertical. Once you start changing
qualitatively, you start soaring high, you move in the vertical world.
Matter is horizontal, spirit is vertical. That is basically the meaning
of the symbol of the cross. The cross is not a Christian symbol,
remember; the cross is older than Christ; it is a very ancient symbol.
The cross simply means that life has two dimensions: one horizontal, one
vertical. If you live on the horizontal you will live asleep -- that's
why when you have to go to sleep you have to be in a horizontal
position; lying down in the bed, you become horizontal. When you wake
up, you stand up, you</p><p>become vertical.</p><p>Now, even scientists will agree with it, that all that has happened
to man, all evolution, has happened because man some day in the past
decided not to walk on four but to stand on two feet. Man became
vertical -- that was the moment when evolution started. Man was no more
animal. Animals are horizontal: man became vertical.</p><p>Just the physical verticality, and so much has happened to man. Think
of spiritual verticality, think of the spiritual verti-cal dimension,
and you cannot even imagine what is possible, you cannot even dream
about it. You have no idea at all! You need not be beggars then -- the
whole kingdom, the whole universe, with all its beauty and joy, is
yours.</p><p>IT IS MORNING, SWAN, WAKE UP, CLIMB IN THE AIR...! I KNOW OF A
COUNTRY THAT SPIRITUAL FLATNESS DOES NOT CONTROL, NOR CONSTANT
DEPRESSION, AND THOSE ALIVE ARE NOT AFRAID TO DIE.</p><p>Kabir says: I KNOW OF A COUNTRY... I know of a space -- if you come
with me, if you dare to come with me, it needs daring, if you are
courageous enough to soar with me, if you are ready to leave the muddy
pools where you have made your abodes, to go to the Himalayas, beyond
the Himalayas, to the purest lake, Mansarovar.… The word MANSAROVAR IS
also beautiful -- it means the lake of consciousness.</p><p>I KNOW OF A COUNTRY THAT SPIRITUAL FLATNESS DOES NOT CONTROL...</p><p>Here, in the name of spirituality, something pseudo, something false
is being sold. The temples and the mosques and the churches and the
gurudwaras, they are selling you something which has nothing to do with
spirituality. Nanak had something to give, but Nanak is no more. And
Mohammed had something to give, but he is no more. Now there are only
dead traditions. You will have to find an alive Master who KNOWS OF A
COUNTRY WHERE SPIRITUAL FLATNESS DOES NOT CONTROL.</p><p>In this world. very spiritually flat people are thought to be saints.
In fact, the more spiritually flat you are, the more spiritually stupid
you are, the more you will be respected by the masses -- because the
more you will oblige the masses by being according to their ideas of
what a saint should be. Only mediocre, stupid people can follow the
masses, can fulfill their expectations.</p><p>A man who has any courage, a man who has any guts, is bound to be a
rebel. He will not be worshipped as a saint in his life -- he will be
worshipped as a saint only when he is gone. People worship dead saints:
either you have to be dead while alive -- they will worship you -- or
they will wait: when you really die and nothing of you is left, and the
whole fragrance has evaporated, then they will worship you.</p><p>Jesus they crucified, and crucified Jesus they worship. Socrates they
killed, poisoned, and now for centuries they have honoured him as one of
the greatest human beings who has ever walked on the earth. Mansoor they
murdered, butchered, and now Sufis go on claiming that he is one of the
greatest Sufis. When he was being killed, even these Sufis were standing
in the crowd and watching. And nobody even protested -- not even a very
famous Sufi, Junaid, who was present in the crowd and who knew perfectly
well that Mansoor was innocent, that Mansoor's declaration "I am God!"
was not against God.</p><p>Mansoor's declaration that "I am God!" was not a sin. In fact,
Mansoor was no more there</p><p>-- God had declared himself through him. Junaid knew it, but still
was afraid of the crowd, kept quiet. And when people were throwing
stones and mud to humiliate and to insult the dying man, he also threw a
roseflower -- for two reasons. Must have been a very diplomatic mind: so
people knew that he was also throwing something, that he was not in
favour of Mansoor, and Mansoor would know that he had not thrown a stone
or mud -- he had thrown a roseflower. But the story is tremendously
beautiful...</p><p>When he was being hit by stones and his whole body was oozing blood,
he was laughing, he was in a state of celebration, because he was being
sacrificed in the name of God. It was a moment to celebrate! But when he
was hit by the roseflower, he wept -- the story says Mansoor wept.</p><p>Somebody standing nearby asked him, "What is the matter with you?
Stones are</p><p>being thrown at you; all over the body you have been wounded, blood
is flowing from everywhere, and you kept laughing and smiling. And a
roseflower hit you, and you wept?"</p><p>Mansoor said, "Yes, because the man who has thrown the roseflower
knows that I am innocent. Still he is not courageous enough to say so.
The others who are throwing stones at me are ignorant -- I am praying
for them, I am praying to God, 'Forgive them because they know not what
they are doing.' But I cannot pray for this man who has thrown the rose,
that's why I am crying and weeping. What should I do now? I cannot say
to God,</p><p>'Forgive this man because he knows not what he is doing' -- he knows
perfectly well what he is doing, and he knows perfectly well that I am
absolutely innocent."</p><p>When he said these words, Junaid disappeared into the crowd, became
very much afraid: people might catch hold of him.</p><p>Now, Sufis go on claiming that Mansoor was one of the greatest
enlightened people of the world, now they worship him.</p><p>The ways of man are very strange. This world is really very flat as
far as spirituality is concerned. And the so-called spirituality is very
boring too. And the so-called spirituality is more or less rubbish --
rubbish that has gathered down the ages: theories, thoughts, systems,
but not a single iota of experience.</p><p>Hence Kabir says:</p><p>I KNOW OF A COUNTRY THAT SPIRITUAL FLATNESS DOES NOT CONTROL...</p><p>Come with me! I can take you to a space where all these fools are no
more pretending to be spiritual, where all these dull, stupid fellows
are no more thought to be saints.</p><p>A priest dies. At the Pearly Gates he is given a warm welcome by
Saint Peter, who presents him the keys of a small, old, rotten car and a
small one-bedroom apartment.</p><p>When he gets there, there is another pleasant surprise for him, for
his next door</p><p>neighbour turns out to be a parson who had been a good friend of his
Down Below.</p><p>They decide to stroll down to the Pearly Gates to check out the
action, and they are horrified when they spot a certain rabbi strolling
through the Pearly Gates as though he own the place. For they knew this
particular rabbi only too well, and he had been the scandal of their
community. Sodomy, usury -- name any vice, he had committed it. The two
reverends were even more horrified when Saint Peter bowed low to the
rabbi, told him what an honour it was to have him in Heaven, and
presented him with keys to a Rolls Royce, a town house and a country
house.</p><p>"This is outrageous!" priest and parson storm at Saint Peter. "We
lead pious, godfearing lives and all we get are small cars and small
apartments. But this schmuck of a rabbi, he does everything vile, yet
you give him a Rolls Royce, a town house, and a country house.</p><p>How come?"</p><p>"Well, I am sorry, gentlemen," Saint Peter apologizes, "but he is a
relative of the management."</p><p>Kabir is not talking about a country like this. He is not talking
about the heaven of your imagination. Your heaven will be an exact
replica of this world; maybe a little bit decorated here and there,
modified, a little better -- a better standard of living, but not real
life.</p><p>Kabir is talking of an inner space:</p><p>I KNOW OF A COUNTRY THAT SPIRITUAL FLATNESS DOES NOT CONTROL, NOR
CONSTANT DEPRESSION.</p><p>In this world you will find two types of people: one who is just
boringly religious, flat; another who is just worldly, but depressed.
The pseudo religious at least hopes that something great is going to
happen after death, but the worldly man does not even have that hope --
he is very depressed. You can see this...</p><p>In India you will feel the difference from the West. India is a flat
spiritual</p><p>country, but people are in a way hopeful. Life is short, and soon it
will be gone, and then the paradise and all the joys; and the more you
suffered in life, the more you will be rewarded. So carry on, be
patient.</p><p>In the West, people are not flatly spiritual, and they have no hope,
no future, no life after death. Then there is great depression, then
they are very heavy, as if they are carrying mountains of worries,
anxieties.</p><p>Both states are wrong. Kabir says:</p><p>... AND THOSE ALIVE ARE NOT AFRAID TO DIE. I KNOW OF A COUNTRY...</p><p>... where people know death is a lie, where people know that life is
eternal. I know a space where you will also be able to see and feel and
experience that life never begins, never ends -- that death is only a
change of garments.</p><p>THERE WILD FLOWERS COME UP THROUGH THE LEAFY FLOOR, AND THE FRAGRANCE
OF 'I AM HE' FLOATS ON THE WIND. THERE THE BEE OF THE HEART STAYS DEEP
INSIDE THE,FLOWER.</p><p>AND CARES FOR NO OTHER THING.</p><p>He is talking about the inner space, the inner silence, the
contentless consciousness, samadhi.</p><p>THERE WILD FLOWERS COME UP...</p><p>Wild because they are spontaneous, wild because no gardener has
tended to them, wild because they are SO full of life -- they are not
civilized, cultured, pale</p><p>-- so full of blood and so full of juice. Wild because you have not
seen them yet, not even in your imagination do they cast any
shadows.</p><p>THERE WILD FLOWERS COME UP THROUGH THE LEAFY FLOOR,</p><p>AND THE FRAGRANCE OF 'I AM HE' FLOATS ON THE WIND.</p><p>NOW THIS IS SOMETHING UNTRANSLATABLE. The Sanskrit word that Kabir
uses is SOHAM. Literally it means 'I am he' -- 'I am that.' But that is
not the point. SOHAM is not a word but a sound. If you become utterly
silent, you will hear this sound arising from the deepest core of your
being: SOHAM. It is not a word; it is a sound, pure sound. It is a kind
of inner music which is heard when all the noise of the mind has left
you. Because it is heard only when the mind has left you, when there are
no longer any thoughts to disturb, no interference, the whole world
forgotten, and you are in absolute aloneness, and everything has
stopped, time has stopped, space has disappeared, when there is only
pure consciousness vibrating -- that's what Zen people call the sound of
one hand CLAPPING: SOHAM -- because this sound is heard only when you
have reached the very center of your being, and because with this sound,
once heard, you become absolutely certain, not convinced, not that you
start believing, you become absolutely certain through knowing that 'I
am he' -- hence the sound has gathered a meaning around it, but
basically it is a sound.</p><p>And the mystics say that the whole existence is full of this sound,
SOHAM. Whenever you are silent, you will hear it. This is the voice of
God, and this voice reveals to you who you are.</p><p>... AND THE FRAGRANCE OF 'I AM HE' -- SOHAM -- FLOATS ON THE
WIND.</p><p>THERE THE BEE OF THE HEART STAYS DEEP INSIDE THE FLOWER...</p><p>Then who wants to go out? The sound of SOHAM showers on you as
nectar. Then who wants to go out? for what? All that you have been
desiring is suddenly fulfilled; all that you have asked is given. The
door is open.</p><p>THERE THE BEE OF THE HEART STAYS DEEP INSIDE THE FLOWER, AND</p><p>CARES FOR NO OTHER THING.</p><p>DON'T GO OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE TO SEE FLOWERS. MY FRIEND, DON'T BOTHER
WITH THAT EXCURSION.</p><p>INSIDE YOUR BODY THERE ARE FLOWERS.</p><p>HE IS INDICATING TOWARDS THE SEVEN CENTERS -- the seven chakras.</p><p>Those seven chakras are called seven flowers. We become aware only of
the first, and that too in a very dim and dismal way -- a sound heard
from far away, or just an echo. We become aware of the first center
only, the sex center, and that too only once in a while.</p><p>All your sexual experiences don't bring you to the awareness of the
flower. Only when you have a deep orgasm, only when you have a total
orgasm, when your whole body pulsates with joy, when each fiber of your
body dances with joy, when each cell of your body goes mad, wild with
joy -- then only do you become aware of the first flower.</p><p>Even that is very rare; not more than one percent of people become
aware of it. Ninety-nine percent know sex only as a relief; they don't
know its orgasmic quality. Even if they think they are having an orgasm,
it is not orgasm -- it is just genital relief.</p><p>Orgasm has nothing to do with genitals as such. Genitals are involved
in it, but orgasm is total -- from the head to the toes, it is all over
you. Nothing is being held behind. A total involvement in the moment, a
total merger -- then you become aware of the first flower.</p><p>And there are six higher flowers, and as you move higher, deeper
orgasmic experiences are waiting for you. The seventh, the last, is
called SAHASRAR -- the one-thousand-petalled lotus. And when the
seventh, that is in the head, opens up, you have transcended humanity,
you are no more a human being. You may be in the human body, but you are
a God.</p><p>The Western mind finds it very difficult; they cannot understand why
we call Buddha a God, why we call Mahavira a God, why we call Krishna a
God. They don't even call Jesus a God; they only call him 'the son of
God'. Their idea of God is: one who created the world.</p><p>But in the East we have gone far deeper than that. Nobody has ever
created the world; in the Christian sense there is no God at all. God is
not a creator but the creativity, the energy that has become manifest in
existence. God is in the tree, in the rock, in the river, in you, in me.
But then why do we call Buddha a God if God is everywhere? Buddha has
awakened to his godliness, others are fast</p><p>asleep.</p><p>By calling Buddha a God we don't mean that he created the world, we
don't mean that he controls the world -- we simply mean that he has
attained to the seventh orgasm, that he has come to the seventh
flowering, that the ultimate has opened in him, that he is no more an
individual, that he has become universal.</p><p>Your head has an opening.… Just try to understand: your sex center
has an opening; that opening joins you with nature, that opening takes
you downwards. Exactly like the sex center, on the opposite pole, is
SAHASRAR -- that opens upwards. Just as sex takes you downwards,
SAHASRAR takes you upwards.</p><p>Sex is under the law of gravitation and SAHASRAR IS beyond the law of
gravitation. It functions under a totally different law -- you can call
it levitation, or you can call it</p><p>'grace'. The law that pulls you down is gravitation, and the law that
pulls you up is grace.</p><p>Science is not yet aware of the other law; that is unfor-tunate. But
religion is basically the art of helping you enter into the realm of the
second law, the law of grace. And once your SAHASRAR, the
one-thousand-petalled lotus, has opened, you disappear as an ego: God
appears in you. Your form will remain human, but in the form of the
human the superhuman starts descending.</p><p>Hindus call this state AVATARA. The word AVATARA means descendence:
when a person is open towards the sky, the sky descends in him, he
becomes an AVATARA.</p><p>DON'T GO OUTSIDE, says Kabir, YOUR HOUSE... has all that you are
searching and seeking outside.</p><p>DON'T GO OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE TO SEE FLOWERS. MY FRIEND, DON'T BOTHER
WITH THAT EXCURSION. INSIDE YOUR BODY THERE ARE FLOWERS.</p><p>ONE FLOWER HAS A THOUSAND PETALS.</p><p>Six are lower. Up to the sixth you remain a human being -- you become
a very superior human being, but you remain a human being. Up to the
sixth you remain a sage. Entering into the seventh you become a God.</p><p>ONE FLOWER HAS A THOUSAND PETALS. THAT WILL DO FOR A PLACE TO
SIT.</p><p>And once you have arrived at the seventh, you have come home. Now you
can sit at rest, now you can relax. Now there is nowhere to go. Now all
is completed, fulfilled.</p><p>This was the search... and you ran in all directions. In all the ten
directions you were running, hither and thither for thousands of lives,
and not even a glimpse was found. But once you have reached the seventh,
all is fulfilled. Suddenly now you can rest. Now there is nowhere to go,
no goal to attains no object for your dec;ire -- hence desirelessness
happens naturally.</p><p>SITTING THERE YOU WILL HAVE A GLIMPSE OF BEAUTY...</p><p>And this is what WE call beauty in the East. Unless the seventh
flower has opened in you, you know nothing of beauty. You only say that
the rose is beautiful, the sky is beautiful, the river is beautiful. You
are using the word 'beautiful', but you don't know exactly what beauty
is.</p><p>If somebody persists, insists, "Define what beauty is," you will be
at a loss. You will not be able to define it -- in fact, you have not
known, you have simply heard. Others say the rose is beautiful, so you
say the rose is beautiful. You are simply repeating others'</p><p>opinions.</p><p>Just fifty years ago, nobody had heard that the cactus is beautiful
-- now the cactus is on the throne, the rose is dethroned. Now to talk
about the rose and its beauty seems very outdated; now people have not
rose plants in their houses but cactuses. The more sophisticated a
person is, the more he will appreciate the beauty of the cactus.</p><p>The fashion has changed. Fashions change! The rose has lost its face.
After a few days, the rose will come back, because people get tired --
cactus and cactus</p><p>and cactus -- and then one day they decide enough is enough. Again,
suddenly, they have to change. Watch people's dresses: each year they go
on changing, and after ten, twelve years the old dress comes back,
because from where are you going to get new ideas? You can ask Padma
--</p><p>just the SAME ideas go on moving in a circle.</p><p>You don't know what beauty is. You use the word, certainly, but your
word is empty.</p><p>Beauty is known only by one who has known the inner beauty, one who
has known the inner flower opening. Then whenever a flower is seen, it
reminds you of your inner beauty.</p><p>Yes, Kabir seeing a roseflower will start dancing, will start
singing, because the rose flower on the outside will simply trigger his
inner experience of his own flower. Seeing the starry night, he will
start singing or playing on his flute, because suddenly the starry night
will remind him of his own inner sky -- which is far more beautiful.</p><p>SITTING THERE YOU WILL HAVE A GLIMPSE OF BEAUTY INSIDE THE BODY AND
OUT OF IT,</p><p>BEFORE GARDENS AND AFTER GARDENS.</p><p>Once you have seen the inner beauty, then you will be able to see the
outer also as beautiful. Once you have seen God within, you will be able
to see him without too. The original is very beautiful:</p><p>BAGO NA JA RE NA JA, TERI KAYA MEN GULJAR.</p><p>Don't go to the gardens! The garden is within you.</p><p>Don't go, don't go, don't go to the gardens.</p><p>BAGO NA JA RE NA JA, TERI KAYA MEN GULJAR.</p><p>Within your own body is the garden of gardens. SAHAS-KANVAL PAR BAITH
KE</p><p>TU DEKHE RUP APAR.</p><p>Find out where this one-thousand-petalled lotus is within you, and
then sit upon it,</p><p>and then see the beauty of the formless, then see the beauty of the
invisible, then see the beauty of the intangible, then see the beauty of
the unknowable.</p><p>Those who have only known the known have known nothing. Those who
have only seen the seeable have not seen anything. Unless you become
capable of seeing the unseen and hearing the unheard, you have not come
yet to your full potential.</p><p>God gives you a great gift of potential. The only way to return the
gift in gratitude and thankfulness is to make the potential actual. Be
what your seed is carrying within you.</p><p>Become it! Be it!</p><p>This small body is not small: it contains a universe. And this body
is not just a body: it is the temple of God. Love it, respect it,
explore it. And don't get stuck at the first center.</p><p>You have to move from sex to samadhi. Unless your sexual energies are
transformed into samadhi you are not fulfilling your destiny, you are
not fulfilling your nature. You are missing the great opportunity that
life is.</p><p>The Fish in the Sea is Not Thirsty</p><p>Chapter #8</p><p>Chapter title: Time to be Getting Home 18 April 1979 am in Buddha

I HAVE THIS GUT-FEELING THAT I NEED
TO DO TO BE WORTHY, TO CONTRIBUTE, TO GIVE SOMETHING. AND</p><p>YOU SAY THAT GOD IS WITHIN ME. I REALIZE I AM LOOKING INSIDE FOR</p><p>SOME CONCEPT I GOT FROM THE OUTSIDE. IT IS LIKE LOOKING DOWN</p><p>INTO A WELL IN THE NIGHT. I SEE REFLECTIONS AND I THINK IT IS THE</p><p>BOTTOM, BUT IT IS ONLY THE SURFACE. EVEN WHEN I KNOW NEED ONLY</p><p>LET AND WAIT RATHER THAN LOOK FOR ANYTHING, I AM STILL WAITING</p><p>FOR MY OWN CONCEPTS OF WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN. PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p>Prem Garima,</p><p>THE FIRST THING -- THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL -- TO BE understood is</p><p>that you are already in God. It is not a question of being in God:
you are already there. Just as the fish is in the ocean, you are in God.
God simply means the existence, that which exists.</p><p>In the ancient Hebrew, the word 'God' stands for that which is. 'G'
stands for that, 'O' for which, and 'D' for is -- that which is. The
word 'God' is tremendously significant. It does not indicate a person;
it simply indicates a presence. And the presence is everywhere!</p><p>Life is synonymous with God, universe is synonymous with God. To be
is to be in God --</p><p>there is no other way. To breathe is to breathe in God -- there is no
other way. To sleep is to sleep in God and to wake up is to wake up in
God -- there is no other way. You can choose to sleep, still you are in
God. You can choose to forget God, still you are in God.</p><p>You can choose to deny God, still you are in God. Not to be in God is
the only impossible thing -- the only impossible thing I say.</p><p>So it is not a question of becoming worthy. But I am not saying don't
become worthy. I am not saying be lazy, lousy. I am not saying become an
escapist. I am</p><p>not saying don't contribute to existence. But your contribution to
existence should not be a means to reach God -- that's what I am saying.
Your contribution to existence should be in gratefulness that you are in
God. It should not be a means to reach -- because you are already there.
It should be an overflowing of joy because you are already there. Be
very clear about the distinction.</p><p>Share your joy, your love, your ecstasy. Make life as beautiful as
possible. Just out of thankfulness that God has chosen you to be, that
you are allowed to be, that you are given life. What else can you do? If
you can sing a song, sing it with your totality! If you can paint,
paint, and put your whole heart in it. If you can dance, dance to
abandon so you disappear completely in the dance and there is no more
any dancer but only the dance remains.</p><p>But these are not means, let me remind you, to reach God -- these are
just our poor thanks, our heartfelt gratitude.</p><p>Prayer is true when it comes out of gratitude. Prayer is false when
it is just a means to persuade God, to seduce God, to ask for something
from him -- even if you are asking God himself, then too your prayer is
full of desire. And when prayer is full of desire, it is too heavy, it
can't have wings. It can only grope in the darkness of the earth; it
cannot soar high in the sunlit sky.</p><p>When prayer is without desire it has wings, it can reach the
ultimate. And when prayer is without weight, when it is out of
thankfulness, not desiring anything but just to show your gratitude for
all that God has already done for you.…</p><p>Garima, you say: IS IT ENOUGH FOR US TO JUST BE? BUT MY GUT- FEELING
IS</p><p>THAT I NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO BE WORTHY, TO CONTRIBUTE, TO</p><p>GIVE...</p><p>It is not a gut-feeling: it is just what has been conditioned in you
by the society. The society has been telling you continuously,
persistently, day in, day out, from your very childhood -- in the
school, in the college, in the university, in the church, the priest,
the politician, the parent, the professor, they are all joined together
in one single conspiracy: to give you the idea that as you are you are
unworthy. You have to do something, you have to prove yourself, then
only will</p><p>you be worthy.</p><p>This is the strategy of the society to exploit you; this is the
society's ugly way to make slaves of you, not creators but slaves. But
in beautiful, sophisticated ways you have been conditioned. Beautiful
words covering very ugly realities. The ugly reality is that the society
wants to use you as a slave, the society wants to manipulate you, the
society wants to control you. It manages it in two ways.</p><p>On the outside is the state, the policeman, the magistrate; they
enforce laws, but laws can never be absolute and man can always find
ways to defy laws. Then the society creates another safeguard: it
creates a conscience in you; it goes on hypnotizing you, saying again
and again that you have to be worthy.</p><p>And the helpless child has no other way than to oblige, than to
surrender. His whole life is at stake; he cannot survive on his own. He
has to depend on the parents. He has to watch continuously what THEY
want, what THEY appreciate, what is rewarded by them.</p><p>If it is rewarded by them, then he is worthy, he feels good; if he is
punished by them, he feels unworthy, he feels bad about himself</p><p>Slowly slowly the idea settles, sinks deep in your heart, becomes
almost your second nature, that just to be is not enough. Trees are
enough, animals are enough, birds are enough -- only man has this stupid
idea that just to be is not enough. It is a very cunning tactics to
destroy the freedom of the individual, to destroy the self-respect of
the individual, to create in the individual a deep guilt feeling. It has
gone deep, certainly -- so deep, Garima, that you misunderstand it as a
gut-feeling. It is not a gut-feeling at all.</p><p>But I am not against being creative, remember. I am all for it. I
want my sannyasins to be creative -- but for a totally different reason,
with a totally different intention, with a totally new motive. I want
you all to be creative; I don't want you to escape to the monasteries --
I want you to live in the world and live fully, and live the whole
spectrum of life. Bring your total potential to expression! Bloom in as
many ways as possible!</p><p>Because only then will you feel fulfilled.</p><p>But this has not to be as a means to attain something. This has to be
just an expression of your joy, of your celebration. And then the
quality changes. When</p><p>you use something as a means, you are not really interested in
it.</p><p>For example, if you are painting just to be appreciated, your focus
is on appreciation, not on the painting; your heart is not there. You
are already imagining, dreaming, how you will be appreciated. And
because your constant worry is how to be appreciated, you will paint
something which will not come out of you spontaneously -- you will paint
something which others are bound to like. You will paint it according to
them. You will become a very poor painter. You will not allow your
genius to come out, because the genius is not easily appreciated,
remember it. The more talented you are, the more genuine your
intelligence is, the less is the possibility of being easily
appreciated. The greater possibility is that you will be condemned. Why?
Because a genius brings something new into the world, so new that old
criterions don't fit with it. And the old criterions are deep-rooted in
the human mind; they cannot easily go away.</p><p>The genius has to create not only his poetry, his painting, his
dance, his music, he also has to create new criterions by which to judge
them.</p><p>Vincent van Gogh was not appreciated in his time -- one of the
greatest painters the world has ever known. He lived in utter poverty;
his brother supported him. But his brother was not much in favour of his
painting either, because it was not paying -- so what is the point of
doing something which does not pay? On the contrary, because of his
paintings people used to think that he was mad. He was painting in such
a new way -- as it had never been done before. He had his own vision. He
was a genius! In his paintings, trees are so high that they reach to the
stars; stars are very small and trees are very big. Now who is going to
appreciate this painting?</p><p>Any schoolchild can say, "This is nonsense! Stars are not so small,
and trees -- who has seen such big trees? reaching above the stars?" But
Vincent van Gogh used to say,</p><p>"Whenever I see a tree, this is my feeling: that the earth is trying
to reach the stars, to transcend the stars, through the trees. These are
the hands of the earth reaching for the unknown, for the transcendental.
And I love my earth, hence my stars are small and my trees are big. I am
PART of this earth, I am also a hand of my earth. To me stars are
small."</p><p>This is not a question of astronomy, physics, mathematics: it is a
totally different</p><p>vision.</p><p>Trees are seen as ambitions of the earth, love affairs of the earth
with the sky. But who is going to appreciate him?</p><p>In one of his paintings the sun is painted black. Now who has ever
seen a black sun? But he used to say that the sun that shines outside IS
black compared to the sun that is inside.</p><p>It is a comparison. Kabir will agree; Kabir says, "When I saw the
inner sun, then I knew that the outer sun is just a black hole. When I
saw my inner life, then I knew that the outer life is nothing but
another name for death."</p><p>The moment the inner is known, suddenly the outer starts fading away.
Now, van Gogh is talking in d mystic way -- he is a mystic -- but who
will understand? It will take years for people to understand. Van Gogh
lived and died unappreciated, unknown. He remained absolutely
unknown.</p><p>You will be surprised to know: now each of his paintings is so
valuable that no other painting can compete. Even Picasso's paintings
are not so valuable -- millions of dollars for a single painting. In his
own day, in his whole life, he could not sell a single painting.</p><p>He had to distribute his paintings to friends or to the man who used
to give him a cup of tea in the morning free of charge. Those same
paintings now cost millions of dollars.</p><p>People had discarded them; people accepted them out of politeness,
because as far as they were concerned it was all junk -- so why collect
it?</p><p>Vincent van Gogh committed suicide when he was only thirty-three. It
was impossible to live; he could not earn a single pie. His brother used
to give him enough money, just enough, to exist, to survive. But he
needed money to paint -- for the canvas and the colours and the brushes.
So this was his arrangement: out of seven days... he used to get money
every Sunday for one week. Every week, for three days he would eat and
for four days he would fast, so that money could be saved to purchase
canvases, colours, and other things that he needed.</p><p>To me, van Gogh's fasting is far more significant than all the fasts
that have been done by your so-called saints. THIS fasting has something
beautiful in it,</p><p>something spiritual in it.</p><p>When your so-called saints go on a fast, it is a means; they are
fasting so that they can reach heaven and enjoy all the heavenly joys.
But van Gogh's fasting has a totally different quality to it: his love
to create.</p><p>And why did he commit suicide? He committed suicide... that too has a
tremendous significance. It is no ordinary suicide. In fact, a man like
van Gogh cannot do anything in an ordinary way. He committed suicide
because he said, "Whatsoever I wanted to paint, I have painted. Now,
just to exist is pointless. I have given that which I came to give; now
I can go back to the original source. There is no need to live in the
body any more. I have contributed."</p><p>Years and years passed, then slowly slowly he was appreciated. Now he
is thought to be one of the greatest painters in the world.</p><p>And this has been so with all the geniuses: in their own time they
are condemned</p><p>--</p><p>condemned by the masses, condemned by the crowd, condemned by the
priests, condemned by the politicians. They are appreciated by only very
few people -- sensitive, receptive, intelligent -- only by very few
people who have the capacity to see something that is new, unknown, that
has never happened before; only by very few people who can put their
minds aside and look.</p><p>I would like you to be creative, but don't be bothered about
appreciation, don't be bothered that you will be gaining fame, name
through it. Whenever the motive is to gain something out of creativity,
you are no more interested in it. You become a technician; you are no
more an artist. You may do the painting, and you may do it perfectly,
technically perfectly, but it will not have the soul, it will not be
alive, because you will not be there. You will be looking all around for
the appreciators to come. And you will always paint accordingly, so that
they can appreciate.</p><p>There are people who say only that which people want to hear. These
people will be very famous, known, appreciated, respected, but they are
mediocre people. The genius speaks that which arises in his heart; he
does not care a bit whether anybody is going to like it or not. He says
it straight, he says it direct -- he never thinks of the results and the
consequences.</p><p>Be creative in that sense and your creativity will become an offering
to God. God has given you so many gifts, Garima; something HAS to be
done just in deep thankfulness.</p><p>But remember: with no motive, not as a means but as an end unto
itself. Art for art's sake, and creation for creation's sake, and love
for love's sake, and prayer for prayer's sake.</p><p>And that's how one, slowly slowly, becomes religious. The religious
person lives in the moment; he has no worry about the future, not even
about the next moment. When it comes, it will come. He does not prepare
for it. He lives this moment, and out of this moment the next will be
born. And if this moment has been beautiful, if this moment has been a
benediction, the next is going to be, of course, a deeper benediction, a
greater blessing.</p><p>Garima, you say: I HAVE THIS FEELING THAT I NEED TO DO TO BE
WORTHY...</p><p>THE NEED TO DO CAN BE A GUT-FEELING, because we have too much energy
and the energy wants to dance, the energy wants to paint, the energy
wants to sing, the energy wants to DO something. But this can't be a
gut-feeling: I NEED TO DO TO BE</p><p>WORTHY. That is a feeling that has been put inside you -- like
scientists put electrodes in the brain and then a person can be
manipulated.</p><p>Just like that the society has been going on down the ages -- it
creates a conscience in you: "Do this, this is right, approved,
respected. Don't do that; that is unworthy of you.</p><p>You will be condemned if you do it." And a kind of division is
created within you between right and wrong, between the 'should' and the
'should-not'.</p><p>And the problem is that no 'should' can ever be a fixed phenomenon;
it changes with life.</p><p>No right is always right, and no wrong is always wrong, so to decide
beforehand is dangerous. I don't teach you conscience; conscience means
right and wrong are like things, decided: this is a rose and that is a
lotus, and this is a stone and that is a diamond -</p><p>- decided. Decided for ever! Right and wrong are not things. They
change. Life is a riverlike phenomenon. What is right today may not be
right tomorrow.</p><p>One Zen Master asked his disciple, "What is God?"</p><p>The disciple bowed down, remained silent. The Master blessed him and
said, "This is good. I am happy."</p><p>Next day, again, the Master asked the disciple, "What is God?"</p><p>And of course now he had learnt, so he bowed down, an even deeper
bow, remained quiet, even closed his eyes, and the Master hit him hard
on the head and said, "You stupid!" The disciple was puzzled. He said,
"But what has happened? Yesterday you were so happy, and the answer is
the same -- even better than yesterday!"</p><p>And the Master said, "That is where you went wrong: yesterday was
yesterday, today is today. Now you are simply repeating a ready-made
formula. Now you are not being true, not being spontaneous, not being
responsible. Now you have learnt a trick. How can the same answer be
right today? Twenty-four hours have passed, so much water has gone down
the Ganges!"</p><p>Existence is dynamic, it is not static -- it is not a stagnant pool.
It is a constant continuum, flow. No answer can ever be fixed -- and
that's where the society deceives you: it gives you fixed answers. with
fixed answers one thing is good -- that's why we cling to them --</p><p>they give you a sort of certainty, security, safety. You can remain
certain that you are right.</p><p>But life goes on changing, And your 'right' remains fixed. And then
your whole life becomes a misery, because your answers never fit the
questions. Then your whole life is an effort to put square plugs into
round holes -- your whole life you go on trying. And it is very
frustrating. And the reason is: you never see that life is changing.</p><p>And the really conscious person changes with life. The really
conscious person cannot afford to be consistent. Consistency is part of
a mediocre mind. I am not saying be deliberately inconsistent; I am
simply stating a fact, that to be consistent means to be stupid, to be
consistent means to remain with the past,</p><p>blind to the present. If you look at the present you have to change
with life.</p><p>Hence you will find a thousand and one contradictions in Jesus'
statements, and so is the case with Gautam Buddha. And that has always
been the case with the enlightened people, because they don't have any
ready-made answer. You hanker for the ready-made answer so you can jump
upon it, you can hold it tight in your hand and you can be certain.</p><p>You suffer from uncertainty -- and uncertainty is the nature of life.
Certainty is part of death. Be certain and you will be dead. Remain
flowing, remain uncertain, remain available to the changing
circumstances, and you will remain more and more alive.</p><p>To be totally alive means to live in the moment with no past
interfering at all -- then you respond to the moment and the response
comes from your consciousness not from your conscience. Conscience is a
deception; conscience is a social trick. The society has created the
conscience. And the function of the Master is to destroy your conscience
so that your consciousness can be freed.</p><p>Your gut-feeling is not a gut-feeling. You have been deceived. There
is no need to do anything to be worthy -- you are already worthy. If you
were not worthy, you would not be here at all. God has given you birth,
has created you -- must have seen some worth in you. If you are
unworthy, then God is not a very original creator, then he is not much
of a creator either. How can he create an unworthy person?</p><p>Society makes you unworthy, because that is the only way to exploit
you -- to make you feel unworthy. Then you will try hard to become
worthy because that is the only way to gain self-respect. And to become
worthy you will follow the dictates of the society.</p><p>Society creates fear in you -- fear of being unworthy, fear of being
condemned, fear of being left alone, fear of being nobody, fear of being
anonymous. And then you are ready to yield, to bow down, to any kind of
nonsense.</p><p>Simon's parents were in despair when he flunked out of school. They
tried sending him to every school in the city -- private, public,
progressive, military academy -- but he took no interest. Finally they
tried a Catholic school. When Simon came home with his first report
card, his parents were surprised to see a straight A report.</p><p>"What happened?" they asked him.</p><p>"Well," he replied. "When I saw that poor guy nailed to the cross
everywhere I looked, I knew they meant business!"</p><p>Create fear... create as much fear as you can. That has been the
policy of the society.</p><p>Hells have been created just to catch hold of you; heavens have been
created just to reward those who will follow the dictates. All are
imaginary: there is no hell, no heaven.</p><p>But these rewards and punishments are subtle strategies, and they
have worked up to now, and they have destroyed all human dignity.</p><p>This is not a gut-feeling in you. Your gut-feeling and the conscience
created by the society have got mixed up. The gut-feeling is to DO
something -- yes, that is a gut-feeling. When energy is there, one wants
to do something; that is natural. Energy wants to be expressed. But WITH
the motive to be worthy, that is a conscience part which is getting
mixed with your gut-feeling. Be clear about it!</p><p>You have been messed around by the society in every possible way. You
have been confused so much that you have to depend on somebody. Either
you go to the priest -- in the old days you used to go to the priest. In
India they still go to the priest. In the West the new priest has
arisen: the psychotherapist, the psychiatrist, the psychologist -- go to
him.</p><p>And the miracle is that the priest is just like you, maybe even more
in a mess than you are, but still you go to him to find good advice.
Yes, he repeats good advice like a parrot.</p><p>Your psychotherapist, your psychiatrist, your psychoanalyst, may be
in deeper anxiety, in more tensions than you are.</p><p>Just the other night one of my sannyasins was asking me, "Osho, you
had told me last time when I came here, 'Look for the lighter side of
life, count the roses, ignore the thorns. They are there, take note of
them, but don't pay too much attention to them.' But my psychoanalyst
has said, 'This is dangerous, this is going to repress your emotions.'
So I am puzzled -- what to do?"</p><p>I told him, "You just wait a few days, your psychoanalyst will be
here...!" But I was not aware that this sannyasin himself is a
psychoanalyst. Just later on Vivek told me that he himself is a
psychoanalyst. Now, one psychoanalyst going to another psychoanalyst --
for what? And that one may be going to somebody else.</p><p>THE FOUNDER OF PSYCHOANALYSIS, Sigmund Freud, was one of the most
pathological persons you can imagine -- very superstitious. You will
laugh if you go into his biography about how such a man could become the
founder of psychoanalysis, and how such a man could be trusted, that
what he was saying was true.</p><p>One of his friends gave him the idea that just as each woman has a
twenty-eight- day period when her menstruation comes, exactly like that
each man has a twenty-three-day period. There is some truth in it -- not
twenty-three days, exactly twenty-eight days. Now much more research has
been done on it.</p><p>Those four, five days when a woman goes through the period are sad,
depressive, dull, negative -- exactly like that man also goes into a
negative state each month for four, five days. Of course, his period is
not very visible, but it is there; it is a psychological fact. It should
be there, because men and women are not very different.</p><p>So the friend's idea was on the right track. Sigmund Freud suddenly
got one idea</p><p>-- lying down in his bed, he was thinking about twenty-eight and
twenty-three -- suddenly an idea flashed in his mind: twenty-eight plus
twenty-three means fifty-one, and he could not sleep the whole night. He
became certain by the morning that he was going to live fifty-one years
-- a very great gut-feeling. And he started talking about it
twenty-eight plus twenty-three -- fifty-one years and he will die.</p><p>And the fifty-first year came and passed... and he did not die. Then
something else had to be found. The day he was expecting to die, his
phone number was changed and the end of the phone number was sixty-two.
So he said, "Look, another indication: so now I am going to die at
sixty-two." But that day also came and was passing.</p><p>But the people like Sigmund Freud are not easy... they will find
something or other. He was staying in a hotel and the number of the room
was eighty-two, so he said, "Look, another indication from above -- at
eighty-two I am going to die</p><p>-- that is absolutely certain."</p><p>And that day also passed. He died when he was eighty-three.</p><p>Such superstitious people... he was so afraid of death, that's why he
was so much concerned about it. He was so afraid of death that five
times in his life he fainted publicly because somebody started talking
about death. He used to faint flat on the ground. Just the IDEA of
death! And such a pathological, neurotic person became the founder of
psychoanalysis.</p><p>And he used to project himself: whatsoever was true for him he
thought was true for every human being. That is the very limit of
nonsense. All that he has said about man is not about man -- it is about
Sigmund Freud. And Sigmund Freud is a single individual; he does not
represent man. Nobody represents man! Nobody can ever represent man.</p><p>So maybe a few people are helped by psychoanalysis, very few people
-- rarely have I seen a person who has been helped by psychoanalysis --
but those are the people who are of the same type as Sigmund Freud.</p><p>And now much research has happened and it has been found that even
those people who are helped are not helped by psychoanalysis but by
something else. In one experiment, twenty-five persons were given
psychoanalysis for six months, and twenty-five persons were just kept
waiting and were told, "Soon your psychoanalysis will start." They were
all suffering from the same kind of illness, and the result was very
surprising.</p><p>The twenty-five who were given psychoanalysis were helped a little
bit, but the twenty-five who were kept waiting were helped far more.
Just waiting helped them far more. In fact, this secret has been known
in the East, it has been practised for centuries. If you take a mental
case into a Zen monastery, they put him in isolation for three weeks;
nobody talks to him -- just the opposite of psychoanalysis -- nobody
talks to him, nobody listens to him. They just keep him isolated;
somebody goes, absolutely silently, and puts the food there, comes back.
He has to live with himself for three weeks... and miracles have been
happening down the ages.</p><p>Just putting him there for three weeks in isolation, slowly slowly he
cools down</p><p>-- no psychoanalysis, no therapy, just isolation. In fact, he was
suffering too much from people</p><p>-- the stress of being in a crowd continuously.</p><p>Psychoanalysis may not be the real cause of help, but the length of
time -- two years, three years, four years, the psychoanalysis
continues. It continues as long as you can afford it; it depends on you.
If you have enough money, it can continue your whole life.</p><p>In fact, psychoanalysis never comes to a termination. It cannot come,
because the mind is very inventive. It goes on inventing more and more
rubbish. It starts enjoying, slowly slowly, because the more rubbish it
brings up, the more happy the psychotherapist feels.</p><p>Seeing him happy, it obliges more.</p><p>Whatsoever the expectations of the psychotherapist are, the patient
fulfills them. Patients are really patient people, very obliging,
courteous. Good people they are! That's why they are suffering; they are
not hard people -- not hardware but software. Because they are soft they
are suffering. The hard guys are not suffering; the hard guys make
others suffer. The soft guys become victims. Three, four years Lying
down on the couch, talking nonsense, waiting, waiting, waiting -- it
helps one to unwind, one becomes a little more relaxed.</p><p>And somebody is listening to you very attentively, at least
pretending that he is listening very attentively.</p><p>My own observation is that the attention of the psychotherapist is of
immense value. This is a world where nobody gives you any attention. If
the husband wants to talk to the wife she says, "There is so much work
to be done in the kitchen -- and the dishes have to be washed and I have
no time." If the wife wants to talk to the husband, he is tired from the
whole day at the office and the work and the traffic, and he wants to
watch the TV.</p><p>A survey says that the average husband/wife communication in America
is only thirty-three minutes per day -- and that is the average. And in
that thirty-three minutes you can count fighting, nagging,
pillow-throwing, and every kind of thing. Thirty-three minutes only
between husband and wife -- out of twenty-four hours?</p><p>A great need has arisen that somebody should listen to you. Hence the
psychotherapist helps -- he is a professional listener. That is the only
quality that</p><p>he has, the only qualification really. You can start the business --
no other qualification is needed -- if you know only one thing: how to
be attentively sitting there by the side and listening. Just listening
attentively will help. The person starts feeling, "I have some
worth.</p><p>Somebody..." And the more he has paid, the more it helps because the
person who is listening is no ordinary psychotherapist, not
run-of-the-mill."... Somebody special, very famous, world-known -- and
listening so attentively to me?" The very idea gives worth,</p><p>"Then I must be saying something immensely beautiful."</p><p>Gibberish he may be bringing up. That's what in psycho-babble is
called 'free association'</p><p>-- anything that comes to your mind, bring it up. If such gibberish
is being listened to so attentively, a great need is fulfilled -- he
feels worthy, he feels important, he feels somebody.</p><p>Remember, this society has messed you up so much that man as such is
almost on the verge of going insane. All love has disappeared, all
communication has disappeared, all friendship has disappeared, all
aesthetic sensitivity has disappeared. People have become like zombies.
They talk to each other yet they don't talk, they don't meet.</p><p>This society is an ill society, and when I say 'this society' I mean
all the societies that exist in the world, more or less, in this way or
that, they are ill -- because in the past, for centuries, we have been
creating a model of man which is wrong. We are giving people ideals and
saying "Unless you fulfill THESE ideals you will never be worthy." And
those ideals are impossible. We are giving people ideas of being
perfect. and once the idea of being perfect enters in one's being, it
turns one into a neurotic.</p><p>Accept your limitations, accept your imperfections. That's what it
means to be a human being! And accept yourself as you are -- with joy,
not in helplessness.</p><p>Because GOD</p><p>accepts you -- this is my basic teaching -- God accepts you, accept
yourself; love yourself. Let there be a great upsurge of self-love. And
out of that love you will start becoming creative; a person who loves
himself is bound to become</p><p>creative. I am not saying he will become famous; I am not saying that
he will be a Picasso or an Ezra Pound or a Pablo Neruda, no -- he may
be, he may not be. But that is irrelevant! The real thing is to enjoy
creativity. Whatsoever you do, do it with joy, bring your total
intelligence to it, be meditative in it.</p><p>Garima, you say: AND YOU SAY THAT GOD IS WITHIN ME. I REALIZE I
AM</p><p>LOOKING INSIDE FOR SOME CONCEPT I GOT FROM THE OUTSIDE. THAT KIND OF
GOD YOU WILL NEVER FIND WITHIN YOU. You will</p><p>have to drop all the concepts that have been given to you from the
outside,</p><p>because God is not a person. No picture of God exists, no statue is
possible. God is an experience! If you have the idea of a God which your
parents and your society have given to you, you will go inside with that
idea and that idea will be the hindrance -- it will not allow you to see
that which is. And God IS that which is. It needs no concepts to see;
concepts blind you. Drop all concepts.</p><p>If you really want to go in, go as an agnostic. This word is
beautiful. You must have heard the word 'gnostic'; 'gnostic' means one
who knows -- gnosis means knowledge.</p><p>'Agnostic' means one who knows not; 'agnostic' means one who knows
only one thing, that he knows not. Be an agnostic -- that is the
beginning of real religion.</p><p>Don't believe, don't disbelieve. Don't be a Hindu, and don't be a
Jaina and don't be a Christian, otherwise you will go on groping in
darkness for ever and for ever. Unless you drop all ideologies, all
philosophies, all religions, all systems of thought, and go inside
empty, with nothing in your hand, with no idea How</p><p>can you have an idea of God?</p><p>You have not known him. Just go with a great desire to know, but with
no idea</p><p>of knowledge with intensity to know, with a passionate love to know
what is there, but don't carry any ideas given to you by others. Drop
them outside. That is the greatest barrier for the seeker on the path of
truth.</p><p>God is there but you cannot see because your eyes are blinded by the
concepts given to you. God is not a Jew, so if you have a Jewish idea of
God you will not find him. I have heard a beautiful story about a Sufi
mystic, Farid:</p><p>One night he dreams that by the grace of Allah, he has reached
Paradise. And the whole of Paradise is decorated, millions of lights.and
flowers everywhere -- some celebration is going on -- and great music.
He enquires, "What is going on?"</p><p>And they say, "This is God's birthday -- we are celebrating it. You
have come at the right time."</p><p>So he stands underneath a tree to see what is happening, because a
great procession starts moving on the road. A man is sitting on a horse;
he enquires, "Who is this man?" and they say, "Don't you know him? He is
Hajrat Mohammed."</p><p>And then millions and millions of people behind him, and he asks,
"Who are these people?" and he is replied to. "They are Mohammedans,
followers of Mohammed."</p><p>And then comes Jesus, and millions are following him. And then comes
Krishna on his golden chariot, and millions again are following him. And
so on and so forth... the procession continues, continues,
continues.</p><p>And then finally, in the end, on an old donkey an old man is coming.
And nobody is behind him; he is just alone. Farid starts laughing
looking at this man -</p><p>- it is hilarious: nobody following him. And why should he be going
on his donkey? He asks, "Who are you, sir? I have seen Mohammed, Christ,
Krishna, Mahavira, Buddha -- who are you?</p><p>You look like a kind of joke! And nobody following you."</p><p>And the old man is very sad and he says, "Yes, I am God. This is my
birthday. But some people have become Mohammedans, some have become
Christians, some have become Jews, some have become Hindus -- nobody is
left to be with me."</p><p>Just out of shock, Farid woke up. He told his disciples the next day,
"Now I am no more a Mohammedan. The dream has been a great revelation.
Now I am no more part of any organized religion -- I am simply myself. I
would like to be with God, at least one person following him."</p><p>If you have a certain idea of God, you will not be able to see him.
Your very idea</p><p>will become a barrier. Drop all ideas that you have gathered from
without; only then can you go within.</p><p>You say: IT IS LIKE LOOKING DOWN INTO A WELL IN THE NIGHT. I SEE</p><p>REFLECTIONS AND I THINK IT IS THE BOTTOM, BUT IT IS ONLY THE SURFACE.
EVEN WHEN I KNOW I NEED ONLY LET AND WAIT RATHER THAN LOOK FOR
ANYTHING...</p><p>TRUE, GARIMA, STICK WITH THAT INSIGHT. If you are looking for
something you will not be able to see, because the very idea of looking
for something means that you have an idea of what you are looking for.
To look for something is a kind of blindness.</p><p>Seeing happens only when you are not looking for anything in
particular; you are just there, open, available. So whatsoever is is
revealed. Don't look for God if you want to see him. Just wait -- let
and wait. God is a happening! If you are silent, open, loving towards
your own being, conscious, it is going to happen. Any moment, when you
are in the right tuning with existence, it will happen.</p><p>God is there: you are there: just right tuning. And that's what I am
teaching to you: right tuning. Dropping all ideologies helps you to be
rightly tuned. And once you are in tune with existence, that is bliss.
You have come home.…</p><p>Second question:</p><p>Question 2</p><p>OSHO, IS IT TIME THAT I SHOULD BECOME A SANNYASIN?</p><p>IT IS ALREADY LATE! Naresh, you have already waited too long. I have
known you for years, you have known me for years. For what are you
waiting? The meeting should happen now. Still you are asking:</p><p>IS IT TIME THAT I SHOULD BECOME A SANNYASIN?</p><p>Are you dead? If you have any life in you, then this is the time. NOW
is the</p><p>time!</p><p>Remember Kabir -- just the other day Kabir was saying: Now, wake up
-- wake up in the now, wake up here! Don't postpone.</p><p>Branigan was driving down the road. By the way the car weaved in and
out of traffic, you could tell that Branigan was pickled to the
gills.</p><p>"Where do you think you are going?" asked the motorcycle cop who
finally stopped him.</p><p>"I am coming home -- hic -- from a New Year's Eve party!"</p><p>"Are you kidding?" asked the cop. "New Year's was three weeks
ago!"</p><p>"I know," said Branigan. "That's why I figured I better be getting
home now."</p><p>Is it not time, Naresh, to be getting home now? You have waited
already too long, too many lives. Sannyas is nothing but a passionate
jump into the enquiry for the truth, a passionate search from where we
come and to where we are going and who we are. That's what sannyas is
all about.</p><p>But you seem to be almost in a kind of sleep, and that's how
everybody else is. The worldly dreams still seem to be important to you,
hence the question. The world still seems to intoxicate you; money,
power, prestige, are still haunting you. And you cannot be a sannyasin
unless you are utterly frustrated with the world. And remember, I am not
teaching escapism from the world: I teach transcendence, not escape. Be
in the world, but don't be of it.</p><p>A sannyasin is a person who lives in the world but lives
meditatively, and meditation creates a distance. Then you can go on
doing all kinds of things but you don't become intoxicated, you don't
become identified with them. To live in awareness, without any
intoxication with money, power, prestige, is the way of the
sannyasin.</p><p>Hallihan and Flannigan were having a few at a new tavern in town.
After an hour of heavy imbibing, Hallihan asked the bartender for the
washroom.</p><p>"Go to the door, left of the elevator," said the barkeeper, "then
walk down two steps and there you are."</p><p>Hallihan forgot to turn left. He opened the elevator door, took ONE
step and fell down the shaft.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Flannigan followed Hallihan and saw him lying at
the bottom of the shaft.</p><p>"Look out for the SECOND step," shouted up Hallihan. "It's a son of a
bitch!"</p><p>And you have taken many second steps, many many times. You have
fallen many many times. Are you not yet frustrated, Naresh? Are you not
yet finished with the world? Are you still carrying some hope deep down
in your heart? Are you still expecting that the world is going to
deliver something to you? It has never happened -- to no one has it
happened. And it is not going to happen to you.</p><p>The world only promises, it never delivers the goods. That's its
illusoriness; that's why in the East we call it maya. 'Maya' does not
mean that it is not there -- it is very much there, but it only
promises. It never gives anything.</p><p>I have heard a story:</p><p>A man worshipped for many many years -- he must have tortured God as
much as possible. Morning, afternoon, evening, he was praying and
praying and crying and weeping. And, finally, God has to appear, and he
said, "What do you want? Be finished!</p><p>Just take it and forgive me and forget all about me.</p><p>And the man said, "I want something, a power, so that whatsoever I
need is immediately fulfilled."</p><p>So God gave him a box, a golden box -- exactly like the magic box
that I give to you --</p><p>and told him, "Whenever you are in need you can ask. Whatsoever you
ask, the box will immediately give it to you."</p><p>The man forgot all about God, he even forgot to thank him. God waited
a little... but the man was no more interested in him. He was looking at
the box and he started asking,</p><p>"Give me ten thousand rupees!" Suddenly ten thousand rupees appeared,
and he was very happy.</p><p>And it continued: whatsoever he wanted used to come out of the box.
Then one day, one SADHU -- one wandering monk -- stayed with the man.
The sadhu, the wandering monk, also had a box -- bigger than the man's
-- exactly the same shape. The man became interested. He said, "What is
this?"</p><p>The sadhu said, "This is a magic box. You ask anything. it gives you
double."</p><p>"Double!" The man asked, "If I ask ten thousand rupees, He said, "It
gives twenty thousand."</p><p>He fell at the feet of the monk and said, "You are a monk, you have
renounced the world</p><p>-- can't you exchange? I have a small box: it gives only whatsoever
you ask."</p><p>So they changed the boxes. It was late at night, so the man thought,
"In the morning I will try out this new box." And in the morning he
tried; he asked for ten thousand rupees...</p><p>and the box said, "Why not twenty thousand?" And the man said, "Okay,
twenty thousand." And the box said, "Why not forty thousand?" And the
man said, "Okay, forty thousand." And the box said, "Why not eighty
thousand?"</p><p>Then he became afraid, because nothing was coming out! He rushed to
see the monk, but he had left; he had disappeared in the night.</p><p>In the East, we have called the world 'maya', illusory -- it is like
that box of the monk.</p><p>You ask anything and it says, "Okay, you can have double." But it
never delivers any goods; it only promises. The world is almost like the
politicians -- they promise but they never fulfill</p><p>Naresh, are you not yet finished? Have you not seen it happening many
times? Each time you are living an illusion, hoping, dreaming, sooner or
later disillusion comes in, frustration comes in. But rather than seeing
the reality of this world, you immediately jump on another illusion --
you immediately start</p><p>dreaming again.</p><p>Sannyas is seeing the reality of the world, that it never fulfills,
that it cannot fulfill, that it is beyond its capacity to fulfill... one
turns in. One has been a beggar begging from this door and that door;
when one turns in, begging disappears -- one becomes an emperor.</p><p>Then all is yours.</p><p>And you need not even ask for it -- it is simply yours. This whole
existence is yours, its whole beauty, its whole splendour, its starry
nights, its sunsets and sunrises, its flowers and birds -- all is yours.
Not in the sense that you possess it, but in the sense that you can
enjoy it.</p><p>A sannyasin learns how to enjoy, and the worldly mall learns only how
to possess.</p><p>Remember these two things; they are basic. The worldly man only
thinks of how to possess more -- he never enjoys because he is concerned
with pos-sessing more and more and more. The sannyasin enjoys,
whatsoever he has he enjoys -- and he enjoys the whole existence --
which need not be possessed.</p><p>Do you think first you have to possess the starry night, then you
will enjoy it? Do you think first you have to possess all the birds,
then you will enjoy their songs? This existence need not be possessed!
And you can still enjoy. It is YOURS if you want to enjoy -- it is not
yours if you want to possess. To possess it is aggressive; it is
aggression on God. To enjoy it is prayerful.</p><p>The last question:</p><p>Question 3</p><p>OSHO, WILL YOU RECOGNIZE ME AT THE FINAL JUDGEMENT DAY?</p><p>Suresh,</p><p>IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOU: remember to be in orange and with the mala,
because it is going to be difficult to recognize you. Just think of all
the men and all the women that have existed... they will all be there.
There is going to be much difficulty in recognizing people, so just you
remember that thing.</p><p>A timid, conservative, unmarried shopkeeper suddenly came into a
small fortune.</p><p>Overnight, this mild-mannered, mincing little man had all the money
he could possibly use.</p><p>Bravely he snapped his fingers, clicked his heels, and decided to
become a swinger. He bought expensive, mod clothes, had his hair styled,
rented a lavish beach villa in Florida, and got a dark, virile tan.</p><p>Driving home from the Rolls Royce dealer in his new car, wearing his
flashiest sports clothes and swingiest sunglasses, he was suddenly
struck dead by a lightning bolt. Right there in the Florida sun -- a
fatal lightning bolt.</p><p>Up at the Pearly Gates, the shopkeeper angrily faced Saint Peter.
"Why would you pick on me like that? I have been a good man all my life.
The Lord has always watched over me."</p><p>"He was trying to watch over you," explained Saint Peter. "He just
didn't recognize you."</p><p>So, Suresh, please remember it, don't forget: be in orange and with
the mala so that I can recognize you.</p><p>But why are you worried about the Last Judgement Day? I teach you
about the immediate and you ask about the Last Judgement Day! I teach
you the immediate is the ultimate and you ask about the Last Judgement
Day. In reality there can be no day which can be the last. The world
never begins, never ends -- it is a continuum.</p><p>Secondly, the very word 'judgement' is ugly. God is not a judge, God
is a lover -- and the lover cannot be a judge. Jesus said to his
disciples: Judge ye not! Why? Because the moment you judge you start
destroying the other. Who are you to judge? The moment you judge you
start comparing, and who are you to compare?</p><p>Each individual is unique, and each individual brings variety to
existence. The world will not be better if there are only saints and
saints and saints. It will be one of the most boring worlds if there are
only saints and saints and saints. The sinners also contribute
something: they make it a little salty, they bring a little</p><p>taste to life.</p><p>God is not a Judge, god is a lover, and how can love judge? Be
assured that in the eyes of God there is no sinner, no saint -- in the
eyes of God all are alike. And when his sun rises, it rises for the
sinners too, as much as for the saints. And when his roses bloom, they
give fragrance to the saints as much as to the sinners. No distinction
is ever made. Just simple observation will show to you that existence
makes no distinctions. All right and wrong, all good and bad, are human
creations, are man-made concepts and ideas.</p><p>And each society has created its own ideas of good and bad, and they
go on changing.</p><p>They are utilitarian, remember. One thing can be a sin in one society
and may not be a sin in another society. The same thing can be a great
virtue in One society, and may be thought just the opposite in another
society.</p><p>If a person beats his own body so that blood oozes out, what will you
call him? Will you call him a saint or a sinner? It depends... because
there has been a Christian sect that believes in beating your body so
that blood comes out, and the more blood you can bring out of your body,
the greater a saint you are.</p><p>In Russia, before Communism, there was a sect, a great sect of
Christians, who used to cut their genital organs. Women used to cut
their breasts -- and they were thought to be great saints. What do you
think about them? You will think them pathological, mentally ill,
deranged.</p><p>There are ideas and ideas, but all ideas are human. Don't be worried.
There are people who are worried about small things -- they have been
MADE to worry. Somebody smokes and he is afraid that he is going to be
thrown into hell. If you have smoked tao much, one thing is certain,
that you will not be sent to hell because there is too much smoke there,
and you have already done it to yourself.</p><p>Smoking may be bad for your health but is not a sin; you cannot be
thrown into hell for smoking. But there are people who think even
drinking tea... in Mahatma Gandhi's ashram drinking tea was a sin. If
you were caught drinking tea, there was a great fuss about it. Mahatma
Gandhi might have gone for a three-day fast to purify his soul and his
disciples' souls because people are drinking tea.</p><p>And Buddhist monks down the ages have been drinking tea. Tea is part
of their</p><p>meditation -- and there seems to be something in it, because tea has
some chemicals which can keep you awake more easily. It can be a help in
meditation. If you are trying to be alert, tea can be a help.</p><p>In fact, tea was discovered by Buddhist monks; it is their discovery,
because it was discovered in a monastery in China called Ta, that's why
it is called tea. That 'ta' can be pronounced also as 'cha'; that's why
in Marathi it is called 'cha' and in Hindi it is called</p><p>'chai'. But it is from the monastery of Ta.</p><p>And the man who is reputed to have grown the first tea plants was
nobody else but Bodhidharma, the great Bodhidharma. The story is
beautiful: He was meditating, and such a meditator happens only once in
a while. For nine years he sat facing the wall -- just the wall and for
nine years looking at the wall and doing nothing else. And sometimes he
used to fall asleep -- naturally, if you look at the wall that long,
what else is there to do? And he did not want to go to sleep.</p><p>So he tore out his eyelids and his eyelashes and threw them so that
now there was no way to close his eyes. And the story is that out of
those eyelids, those pieces of skin, and the eye-lashes, the first
teaplant grew.</p><p>This is a beautiful story: it simply says one thing, that tea can
keep you awake. It will not allow you and your eyes to close.</p><p>Buddhists drink tea with religious ritual. In Japan, they have tea
ceremonies. Tea is not an ordinary thing for them, because it keeps you
awake, it gives you energy to remain more alert. They have made a very
prayerful, graceful ritual out of it: the tea ceremony.</p><p>In each Zen monastery there is a separate tea temple, the most
beautiful place -- maybe surrounded by a lake, rocks, sand, trees. And
when you go into the temple, you have to go in a certain manner, in a
certain posture you have to sit there, and it takes hours.</p><p>The tea will be prepared, the samovar will start humming, and all
will be sitting in silence listening to the humming of the samovar. And
slowly the flavour of the tea will reach your nostrils, and you have to
drink that too. And then the tea is served -- with great grace, with
great beauty, art. And the tea is served in beautiful cups, hand-made
with great love and care. And then everybody starts</p><p>sipping the tea. And it is done very prayerfully and everybody
remains silent, no gossiping, no chattering -- as if there is nobody.
Then they bow down to each other with great respect, and disperse
without saying a word.</p><p>In one country, tea is so religious, so spiritual, and in Mahatma
Gandhi's ashram it was a sin. It depends. These are all human ideas. You
should not be worried about these things.</p><p>My message is simple: live alert, and live spontaneously, and live
totally -- and forget all about the Last Judgement Day. I recognize you
today, and that's enough. Today is enough unto itself.</p><p>The Fish in the Sea is Not Thirsty Chapter #9</p><p>Chapter title: In Search of the Miraculous 19 April 1979 am in Buddha

IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS</p><p>STUDY OF HOW NON-LIFE IS TRANSFORMED INTO LIVING MATTER IS</p><p>VITAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIP OF SCIENCE TO RELIGION.</p><p>THE REASON IS THAT THE STUDY IS A CLUE TO HOW OUR EMOTIONS AND</p><p>SPIRITUALITY DEVELOPED IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHAT DO YOU THINK?</p><p>Adolph Smith,</p><p>RELIGION AND SCIENCE ARE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE, and because</p><p>they are diametrically opposite they are complementaries. Religion
cannot support science, science cannot support religion. They are bound
to oppose each other -- in their very opposition is their
complementariness. Hence, anything that science is going to discover is
of no value to religion. In fact, EACH scientific discovery makes the
existence of religion more and more difficult.</p><p>Science tries to demystify existence, hence the question 'how?' --
how did life arise out of matter? Religion is basically a different
approach: it does not want to demystify existence; its whole approach is
to reveal the mystery of it. It is not a search for the answer: it is
diving deep in the question itself k does not ask any questions; it
takes life for granted. The question is not how life arose: the question
is how life should be lived, the question is how life should be
celebrated.</p><p>The scientific question will be: What is love? How docs love arise?
What is the causality? And the religious question will be: How to drown
yourself in love?</p><p>How to be in love? How to be love itself?</p><p>Science will come to certain clues; those clues look stupid in the
eyes of a mystic. If you ask about love, science will answer with
something which is nothing but chemistry: hormones, chemicals. And the
grandeur and the splendour of love are reduced -- reduced to a very
mundane world. What does love have to do with chemistry? Love certainly
has something to do with alchemy, but nothing to do with chemistry. It
is a transforming force, but it cannot be reduced to hormones.</p><p>Life cannot be reduced to any answer. Once life is reduced to a
certain answer life becomes meaningless, it is no more worth living. It
is like coming across a lotus flower.</p><p>The poet will enjoy the beauty of it; he will not be bothered where
it comes from. He will simply enjoy the fragrance, the colour, the sun
shining over it, the dewdrops on the lotus petals. And the mystic will
dance around it, because he is not seeing only the lotus flower but he
is seeing something of the transcendental in it. Hidden behind the
lotus, its beauty, its splendour, its majesty, its magic, are the hands
of God. The mystic not only feels the roseflower or the lotus flower, he
also feels the mysterious presence of the unknown force called God
surrounding it, protecting it, caring for it, caressing it.</p><p>The poet simply sees the lotus flower, the mystic goes beyond, he
goes higher -- he takes the roseflower or the lotus flower to the
ultimate peak. And the scientist? -- he will think about where it comes
from. It comes from the mud. The scientist will start moving deeper and
deeper into the mud; he will start enquiring about the mud and the
elements that are in the mud.</p><p>Just look at these three approaches: the scientist goes lower than
the lotus, the mystic goes higher than the lotus, the poet remains with
the lotus. In the ultimate analysis the scientist will think that the
lotus is nothing but mud -- a form of mud</p><p>-- and the mystic will think the lotus is nothing but a manifestation
of God. And for the poet, a lotus is simply a lotus. Now, how can these
three approaches meet?</p><p>The mystic cannot agree with the scientist -- in fact, the mystic
will think that the scientist is destroying something tremendously
important. By all his logical answers, objective answers, he is
destroying the subjectivity of the lotus. The</p><p>mystic may agree a little bit with the poet, but only a little bit,
not the whole way. He will nod to the poet: he will say, "You are on the
right track, you have taken the first step. but don't get stuck there --
go on. The lotus is not enough: you have to find the face of God in the
lotus. And if you cannot find the face of God in the lotus, where else
are you going to find it?"</p><p>Adolph Smith, your question is important -- but don't remain in this
confusion that if you can find some clue as to now matter becomes life
you will be bringing some understanding between religion and science...
you will be talking about mud! And the poet will not be convinced by
you, because he knows the lotus. And what to say about the mystic? He
will simply feel pity for you.</p><p>Everything can either be reduced to its beginnings -- that's what
science goes on doing --</p><p>or it can be raised to the ultimate peak; that's what the work of
religion is. And poetry is just the bridge between the two. The poetic
approach is in a way closer to both science and religion. If you really
want to understand religion, you have taken a wrong route.</p><p>Religion does not think that life needs any answers. Life needs to be
lived in its totality, life needs to be celebrated. Life needs to be
penetrated -- that is the only way to know it.</p><p>Not in the lab, not going deep into life cells, not by analysing the
elements; those are constituents of life, but life is more than the sum
total of its parts.</p><p>Somebody is playing on a guitar, beautiful music. The scientist will
become interested in the guitar, not in the music. He will think, "From
where is it coming?" He may become interested in the fingers of the
musician and in the instrument. He will analyse the instrument and he
will find some wood some strings, this and that -- but that is NOT</p><p>music! And if he analyses the fingers of the musician he will find
some blood, some bones, skin -- and that is not music! Music is
something more. The hands of the musician and the guitar are simply an
opportunity for the beyond to descend to the earth.</p><p>The poet will listen to the music; he will not be worried about the
musician and the musical instrument. He will be drunk with the music.
But the mystic will</p><p>dance with abandon, because in music he will hear the ultimate music.
The poet will forget about the musician and the instrument, and the
mystic will even forget about the music, because it reminds him of
something deep in his own being. It reminds him of what Kabir calls the
music of SOHAM -- I am that. He will forget all that is happening
outside; it has triggered a process in his being. He is transported into
another world.</p><p>ADOLPH SMITH, if you really have any interest in religion then you
will have to meditate -- analysis won't help, scientific investigation
won't help. And remember, I am not against scientific investigation --
if you are interested in it, DO it! But know perfectly well: it is not
going to bridge science and religion -- they cannot be bridged. There is
no need to bridge them either. They have different functions to fulfill;
there is no need to create a synthesis between them -</p><p>- because the synthesis will impoverish both, it will not enrich.</p><p>Existence remains alive through the tension of the polar opposites:
the negative and the positive, man and woman, birth and death, darkness
and light, love and hate -- religion and science. These are the polar
opposites. Life needs them. Without them life will become a stagnant
pool, it will not be a dialectical process any more. Life is dialectics;
it moves through the thesis and the antithesis, and again the synthesis
becomes a thesis and creates antithesis. That's how life goes on
progressing.</p><p>Religion and science don't need to be synthesized -- they need to be
purified. Science should be pure science, utterly scientific; and
religion should be pure religion, utterly mystic.</p><p>I would like you to be reminded of a great statement of a Christian
mystic, Tertullian.</p><p>Somebody asked him, "Why do you believe in God?" And he said, CREDO
QUIA ABSURDUM -- I believe in God because he is absurd."</p><p>Now, what kind of answer is this? But this is the answer of a mystic,
not the answer of a scientist. The scientist will try to prove, will
answer WHY he believes; he will argue. But Tertullian simply says,
"Because God is absurd, hence I believe. I believe in the mysterious, in
the miraculous, in the unanswerable, in the unknowable."</p><p>If you have any interest in religion... and you can be both! I am not
saying that a</p><p>man who is a scientist cannot be religious -- a man who is a
scientist can be religious -- but then he will have to create a
dialectics in his own being. He will have to be very conscious. When he
is working in the lab he has to forget all about religion; religion
should not interfere in his scientific work. And when he leaves the lab
and sits in his meditation chamber he should forget all about analysis,
experimentation, observation --</p><p>there he should be a lover, in prayer, in meditation.</p><p>A scientist can be both. And my approach is this, that I would like
many many people to be both scientists and religious. And if some person
can be all three, that is my vision of a real, true sannyasin: a
scientist, a poet, a mystic. In him humanity will have blossomed to its
ultimate possibilities. The potential in him will have been transformed
into actuality.</p><p>He will have bloomed in all possible ways. He will be a
multi-dimensional man.</p><p>And to be a scientist does not mean that you have to be a physicist
or a chemist or this and that -- to be a scientist means having a
scientific approach. There are problems which can be tackled only by
science. When somebody comes with an illness to me, I tell him to go to
Navanit, to Darshan, to Amrit, to Hamid -- go to the doctors! Your
illness needs a scientific approach.</p><p>In India it happens that ill people go to the saints for their
blessings, and the East has remained ill, poor, because of this
nonsense. If you are poor, don't go to the saints; go to the
technologists, go to the scientists, go to the economists, enquire "Why
are we poor?"</p><p>But you go to the saints and enquire "Why are we poor?" You are
foolish and so are your saints. And they answer you, why you are poor;
they tell you, they have to, because when you question them they cannot
show their ignorance. They tell you because in your past lives you have
been committing so many sins, that's why you are suffering. You ask a
foolish question and you will get a foolish answer.</p><p>Go to the scientist when it is a question about the material world.
And if you have fallen in love, then don't go to a scientist -- avoid
him! Even if he meets you on the way, escape, because he will destroy
your whole love. He will say, "It is all nonsense. It is just the
attraction between female and male hormones -- don't be befooled. Those
hormones are deceiving you." Don't go to the scientist;</p><p>if you want to kiss your woman, don't go to the scientist. He will
say, "This is dangerous. All kinds of infections are possible. And
millions of germs are transferred in a single kiss." He will make you so
afraid that even if you kiss, you will not be totally there in it. And
you will start carrying Dettol and things like that with you -- so kiss
and then immediately wash, or before you kiss, wash.</p><p>Don't go to the scientist when you are in love -- go to the poet. He
knows about love.</p><p>And when you want to know the ultimate mystery, the poet cannot be of
much help either; he remains on the surface. When you want to know the
ultimate mystery, go to a mystic, become a disciple to a Master, because
those secrets can only be imbibed in deep trust, surrender, love.</p><p>The second question Question 2</p><p>OSHO TODAY YOU SAID TO BE CONSTANT IS TO BE STUPID. THE TRUTH</p><p>CANNOT CHANGE IT REMAINS FOR EVER CONSTANT. NOW WHAT?</p><p>I HAVE NOT SAID that to be constant is to be stupid -- I had
certainly said to be consistent is the way of the mediocre mind, the
stupid mind. But don't you see the difference between being constant and
being consistent?</p><p>Consistency is a logical phenomenon. When I say: Don't be consistent,
I mean you need not remain confined to your past -- that's what
consistency is. You have done something today; tomorrow life will
change, and you have to repeat the same thing to be consistent.</p><p>Tomorrow will not be today; today is not your yesterday. The answers
that were adequate yesterday are no more adequate today. Consistency
means that it is always yesterday that has to dominate, it is always the
past that has to dominate the present. That's what I mean by
'consistency'. Then you will never grow, because your youth has to be
consistent with your childhood, and your old age has to be consistent
with your youth -- that means you will remain childish your whole
life.</p><p>And that's how people are. The average mental age of human beings is
only twelve years.</p><p>This is what happens if you enforce consistency. In childhood, a few
answers were given to you; they were good for the time being, but only
for the time being. More than that you would not have understood. But as
you grow, those answers become out of date, those answers become
confinements, imprisonments, those answers become chains. You have to
constantly throw them so that you can remain fresh, so that you can
respond to the reality as it is.</p><p>But this is how, Zareen, it goes on happening: I say one thing, you
understand something else. I say one thing, you hear something totally
different. Your minds are so full of your own thoughts that I say,
"Don't be consistent," and you hear, "Don't be constant."</p><p>Pasquel was being examined for naturalization as a U.S. citizen. "Who
is the President of the United States?" The foreigner answered
correctly. "And the Vice President?" Again he gave the right answer.
"Could you be President?"</p><p>"No, no!"</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"I am-a too busy. I work-a in the barbershop all-a day now."</p><p>Now, his own occupation... he says, "No, no! I am-a too busy. I
work-a in the barbershop all-a day now."</p><p>Zareen, you have heard something which I have not said. Your question
has come out of your own idea. You know, at Least you believe you know,
that the truth cannot change.</p><p>Who told you? And how do you know? Do you know truth? You have heard
it being told to you that truth never changes; it remains for ever
constant. Is it your experience? Have you known anything in life which
remains always constant? Anything, I say, have you known in life which
remains constant?</p><p>Everything is changing if you look at life. If you watch life, then
Heraclitus is right: you cannot step in the same river twice, because
the river is constantly flowing, changing. Old Heraclitus says: The ONLY
thing that never changes is</p><p>change. Only change is constant, otherwise everything is
changing.</p><p>In fact, life is not a noun but a verb. If one day we want to be
really scientific about our language, we will have to drop all nouns. A
really scientific language will consist only of verbs. You see these
trees all around and you think, "Beautiful trees!" But to call a tree 'a
tree' is not true, because a tree is not something static -- it is a
movement. By the time you utter the word 'tree' it has changed. It is no
more the same tree about which you were talking One dead leaf has
fallen, a new leaf is just growing, a bud is opening. The tree is
growing higher -- each moment! Otherwise how is it going to grow?</p><p>To be exactly true about it, it is better to call it 'treeing' rather
than 'a tree'. But we even call a river 'a river' -- a river is a
rivering. It is a CONSTANT change! Life is not really life but only
living -- there is no life as such but only living. Our languages give
us a very wrong notion of the world. There is nothing like love, but
loving.</p><p>Always remember... we have to use nouns because otherwise it will be
very difficult to explain things to each other. For centuries we have
used nouns. But whenever you use the word 'love', remember it is
'loving' -- it is a process. It is not a thing, constant.</p><p>If you have loved, Zareen, you will know: morning it has one colour,
afternoon it has another colour, by the evening it is a totally
different phenomenon. Sometimes the river is very deep and sometimes it
is very shallow. And sometimes it makes much noise, and sometimes it is
very silent. So is love. Sometimes it is sad, and sometimes it is a
rejoicing. It changes its moods constantly. So the only constant thing
is change. But you say:</p><p>THE TRUTH cannot change...</p><p>WHO HAS ORDAINED IT, THAT TRUTH CANNOT CHANGE? What do</p><p>you mean by it? Have you known anything in life that never changes?
The child becomes the young man, the young man becomes the old man, and
the old man is gone one day -- dust unto dust. You go on seeing that
everything is constant change, but there seems to be a fear deep down in
the human heart: the fear is death. If change is there, then death is
bound to happen. Change brings death in.</p><p>So we want to believe in something permanent, absolutely permanent.
It may be truth, it may be God, it may be soul, but something is needed
for the fearful heart</p><p>to cling to so that death can be defied. At least one can believe,
"There is something permanent in which I can have a shelter, which can
become my security."</p><p>Do you know truth? Do you know God? Do you know the soul? No, you
know only death -- which happens every moment, all around. But we go on
defying death; we don't want to look at it, because it reminds us that
we are going to die. We would like something that remains for ever and
for ever. And we would like to be part of it so that we can also remain
for ever and for ever.</p><p>But what is permanent in you? Your body changes -- you can ask
medical science: your body changes constantly. Just ten years ago they
used to think that the body changes totally in seven years' time,
becomes completely new, not even a single cell remains of the old; but
now further research has shown that the body changes totally in one
year.</p><p>The body is continuously renewing itself.</p><p>That's why when you cut your hair and your nails it does not hurt --
why? The hair is part of your body and the nails too, and you are
cutting them and it doesn't hurt? The reason is that your hair is not
alive. These are the dead cells of the body that are being thrown out of
the body. So are the nails -- just dead cells being thrown out of the
body to make place for the new ones to happen. That's why it doesn't
hurt if you cut them.</p><p>In a single year, your body is no more the same.</p><p>Buddha used to say again and again that life is like a flame. You
burn a candle, you light a candle in the evening; the whole night it
burns. In the morning you are just going to put it out -- a question can
be asked of you: "Is it the same flame you started in the evening that
you are putting out?" In a sense it is the same flame, because it
continued the whole night; but in truth it is not the same flame,
because the flame has been constantly changing, becoming smoke, and a
new flame is replacing it. And the replacement is so quick that the old
going into smoke and the new coming into existence is so fast that there
is no gap between the two -- hence you cannot see it, hence you cannot
see that it is not the same flame. Then Buddha had to invent a new
idea.</p><p>The scientists now call it 'continuum', 'continuity' -- it is neither
the same nor not the same, it is a continuity, a continuum. Buddha calls
it SANTATI -- the first</p><p>flame gives birth to another and that gives birth to another, and so
on and so forth, one flame goes on giving birth to another. The whole
night the birth process continued. So it comes into the same line, but
it is not the same. You cannot say that it is different, you cannot say
it is the same. In a sense it is different, in a sense it is the
same.</p><p>Have you known, Zareen, anything in life which is really permanent?
-- anything? Your body changes, your mind changes continuously, your
emotions go on changing. About WHAT truth are you talking?</p><p>Yes, there is one truth which never changes, but that has to be
experienced. Don't take it as a belief. And that truth is not something
outside you; that truth is hidden in you -- that truth is your capacity
to witness. Only the witness never changes, everything else goes on
changing. There is a consciousness inside you that goes on watching and
watching all the changes -- the childhood comes and goes, the youth
comes and goes, the old age comes and goes, and there is a witness
inside who is simply watching.</p><p>All meditation is nothing but an effort to know this witness. There
is no God outside you who is permanent, never changing; there is no
truth outside you which is for ever. Yes, there is a certain reality
inside you, at the deepest core of your being... but to find it, Zareen,
you will have to go deep in meditation. When all thoughts disappear, and
all desires are gone, and when there is nothing to witness, then you
become aware of the witness. Then witnessing turns upon itself. Having
nothing else to see, it starts seeing itself If something remains there
as an object, it remains focussed on the object.</p><p>Meditation is a process of taking all objects away from you; all
contents of the mind are to be taken away. Slowly slowly, one day... the
interval, the gap. Sudden emptiness.</p><p>When there is nothing to see, no content to focus on, then the
miracle happens. The witnessing energy, finding nothing else to obstruct
it, turns in a circle back upon itself.</p><p>This is what Jesus calls 'metanoia', which has been wrongly
translated as 'repent'. It should be translated as 'return', not
'repent'; it should be translated as 'revolution', a
one-hundred-and-eighty-degree turn -- and then suddenly you see
yourself. And this witness has no name. It is neither Hindu nor
Mohammedan; it</p><p>is neither man nor woman: it is just pure consciousness.</p><p>Yes, this pure consciousness is absolutely the same. Except this,
everything else changes.</p><p>And when I was talking to you about consistency I was not talking
about the witness, I was talking about your ideologies, about your
knowledge, about your experiences. They have all to be dropped every
day: die every day to the past so you can remain fresh, so that you can
respond to the reality as it is in the moment, not according to the
past.</p><p>And listening to me, be alert, be very alert about each single word;
otherwise, I will say one thing and you will understand something else.
And you will go on thinking that I have said it.</p><p>These cats are having themselves a little jam session. They are
really wailing. Pretty soon they hear a knock on the door; one of them
opens up and the owner of the building is standing there. "I am sorry to
burst in on you like this," said the landlord, "but do you know there is
a sick old lady moaning upstairs?</p><p>"No," said the cat, "but if you give us the first few bars we can
pick up on it." The third question</p><p>Question 3</p><p>OSHO, WHAT IS IMPORTANT?</p><p>Sambodh,</p><p>IT DEPENDS ON YOU. If you ask me, to me it is all the same. You can
say that everything is important, or you can say nothing is important.
Both mean the same.</p><p>Everything is ordinary, or everything is extraordinary. Whatsoever
you want to choose, whichever word appeals to you -- everything is
important, everything, not excluding anything at all; or nothing is
important. Both mean the same, because the moment everything is
important, or everything is not important, the very word 'important'
loses meaning. The meaning remains only if there are some things which
are important and some things which are not important, a few</p><p>things ordinary and a few things extraordinary. Then the word carries
meaning. But if everything is exactly either important or unimportant,
then the word loses meaning.</p><p>My own suggestion is you can choose either, because the ultimate
result will be the same.</p><p>If you have a negative mind, then the Buddhist answer will be
perfectly right. Buddha says: "Nothing is important." Then there is
nothing to make any fuss about. When hungry, eat; when thirsty, drink;
when sleepy, sleep -- nothing is important. And this will give you a
kind of relaxedness, a calmness -- nothing is important, so whether you
succeed or fail it is all the same, whether you become famous or
notorious, it is all the same, whether anybody knows you or nobody knows
you doesn't matter. It will give you a very relaxed, still, tranquil
state of being -- and that is the purpose!</p><p>Or you can choose Shankara's answer. He says: "Everything is
important, because all is God, even the dust is divine." That too is
perfectly right; you can choose that. Then, too, when hungry, eat,
because it is important; and when thirsty, drink, because it is
important; and when sleepy, sleep, because God is feeling sleepy -- the
God within you.</p><p>These are the two answers, the basic answers: positive and negative.
Just watch your own mind... whichever appeals to you. There are people
who are basically attracted towards the positive, or towards the
negative. Feel your own attraction, what attracts you more.</p><p>And whichever attracts you more, that can become your path: NO can
become your path, res can become your path.</p><p>Kabir's path is that of YES. Buddha's path is that of NO. But,
really, YES and no are not significant. What is significant is totality.
If you say yes with your total being it is totality that liberates. If
you say no with totality, it is totality that liberates. But it all
depends on you.</p><p>There are not some things labelled as important and other things
labelled as unimportant.</p><p>A roseflower may be important to a poet and may be utterly
unimportant to somebody who is only interested in money. For him, a
note, a hundred-rupee</p><p>note, is more important. He will ask, "What is the use of the
roseflower?" In fact, he will be very much worried why people go on
singing songs of rose flowers -- "Why don't they sing songs of
hundred-rupee notes?"</p><p>When I was at university I had a colleague who was really a
money-maniac; his whole interest was money. Even somebody else's
hundred-rupee note, and he would take it in his hand and he would touch
it with such love that you may not have even touched your woman with
that love -- with such care, with such tender hands, as if the note was
alive.</p><p>And his eyes would shine, candles would burn in his eyes when he saw
a note -- even if it was somebody else's note. A note is a note! And his
whole thinking was money: how to have more money?</p><p>And then there is the one about the shipwrecked Englishman: as he
gets out of the water onto the beach of a remote island, he is greeted
by another man standing in the shade of a palm tree. "Pleased to meet
you," says he, and then enquires, "Eton?"</p><p>"Yes," responds the new arrival. "Oxford?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Guards?"</p><p>"Yes." "Homosexual?" "No."</p><p>"Pity!"</p><p>It depends on you what is important. How can I say what is important?
To me, nothing is and everything is.</p><p>The fourth question</p><p>Question 4</p><p>OSHO WHAT TO DO WITH THE FEELING OF HELPLESSNESS AT THE</p><p>FRUSTRATION IN FINDING THAT NOTHING IS ULTIMATELY SATISFYING --</p><p>ALL IS NOT ENOUGH?</p><p>Deva Alla,</p><p>IF THIS IS YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE, then the question won't arise -- then
how can you ask the question? The question arises out of some lingering
hope somewhere in the unconscious: "Maybe there is a way to make it
still. Maybe I have not tried enough, maybe I have not put my energy
totally in it. Hence it is not satisfying. But if you yourself have felt
that nothing is ultimately satisfying, if this is your experience, how
can the question arise? It is so.</p><p>In that very experiencing, in that very understanding, you will be
relaxed. Why ask that anything should be ultimately satisfying? Why not
be satisfied with whatsoever life gives you? -- even if it is only for
the moment. Why be greedy? Alla, you seem to be very greedy. You seem to
be of that old, rotten type of spiritual person -- greedy. He wants
everything for ever, for ever. If he falls in love with a woman, he
wants her to remain of the same age for ever, for ever. He himself will
be growing old -- that is another thing.</p><p>But the woman has to remain young.</p><p>It is these greedy people who have created the ideas of paradise,
FIRDAUS. In their paradise, women never grow old. All women in paradise
are stuck at the age of sixteen.</p><p>Must be getting tired... for millions and millions of years stuck at
sixteen. But it says nothing about the men -- it may be because the
scriptures are written by men. If women were writing scriptures then
they would write something else: men will be stuck somewhere at
eighteen.</p><p>And the same people who go on condemning all kinds of things here go
on promising the same things a thousandfold, for eternity, in paradise.
What kind of logic is this? Alcohol is prohibited here by the
Mohammedans, but in their</p><p>firdaus, in their paradise, rivers of alcohol flow -- rivers! You
need not go to a pub; you need not only drink, you can swim, you can
dive.</p><p>This is strange! -- but not really. The greedy mind is there. The
greedy mind is ready to sacrifice the momentary joy of being in a pub,
of drinking a little bit, for the ultimate joy of drinking and drinking
forever.</p><p>These same religious people who go on condemning the feminine body --
all the religions have committed that crime -- that shows simply only
one thing, that the people who were writing those scriptures were deeply
sexually repressed people. It shows nothing else. It says nothing about
the women, it simply shows something about the scripture writers, that
they were deeply repressed people -- they were afraid of women.</p><p>But here they are afraid, and here they go on telling everybody:
"Beware! Woman is the door to hell!" And the same people provide you
with beautiful women in heaven -- the most beautiful. Do you know? -- in
paradise women don't perspire, they don't need deodorants. Their bodies
have a perfume of flowers -- a natural perfume, not created by some
artificially manufactured perfume. Just naturally like flowers -- roses.
Their bodies are made of gold. What greed! And what are you going to do
with a woman whose body is made of gold? You will be stuck! But the
greed, the greedy mind fantasizing.</p><p>All these scriptures are pornographic. This is real spiritual
pornography: women with bodies of gold, studded with diamonds, no
perspiration, natural perfume, and always young, and all beautiful.</p><p>One great saint died, and by coincidence his great disciple also died
after a few hours.</p><p>The great disciple was very much excited about seeing his master
again. And he was thinking on the way -- it is a long journey from the
earth to paradise -- he was thinking,</p><p>"My master must have been received by angels playing on their harps
and beautiful women dancing, and he must have been given the most
beautiful women because he was such a great saint, such an ascetic. When
he was on the earth he had never touched any woman. What to say about
touching? He had never allowed any woman to enter into his house. He had
never seen any woman face to face; if he had to talk to a woman he would
always look downwards or</p><p>would keep his eyes closed.What great austerities he went through!
Now he must be being rewarded."</p><p>And he reached and he saw his master -- and, really, he was rewarded.
He was sitting under a tree, a beautiful tree, a golden tree; leaves of
emerald and flowers of diamonds --</p><p>and Marilyn Monroe, utterly naked! hugging him. The disciple fell at
the feet of the master and said, "My great master, I was waiting for
this. This was due! You have been rewarded well."</p><p>And the master said, "You stupid fool! Keep your big mouth shut --
you have not grown at all. You don't understand anything. She is not my
reward -- I am her punishment!"</p><p>But these greedy people.…</p><p>Deva Alla, if you know from your own experience that all is
frustrating ultimately, everything only brings joy for the moment, then
why not be happy with the moment?</p><p>Why ask that it should be there for ever?</p><p>I teach you the joy of the moment. Live in the moment, and whatsoever
the moment makes available, enjoy it, celebrate it. While it lasts,
dance! And when it has gone, be grateful that it had come. Why ask
that... NOTHING IS ULTIMATELY SATISFYING --</p><p>ALL IS NOT ENOUGH? Nothing can be done about it! This is so. This is
how the reality is, and the reality is not going to change its ultimate
law for you. Nobody can be all exception.</p><p>But if this experience has not yet become your own, then you will
have to suffer a little more. You will have to hope a little more. When
understanding arises, hope disappears.</p><p>That does not mean that one becomes hopeless: that simply means that
one accepts the life as it is, and whatsoever it gives one accepts with
gratitude and has no complaint.</p><p>In order to get a job with the railroad, Angelo had to pass a test.
"Suppose two trains were heading for each other at a hundred miles per
hour on the same track," asked the personnel manager, "what would you
do?"</p><p>"I take-a the red flag and wave-a them to e-stop," Angelo answered.
"But you don't have a red flag," pointed out the man.</p><p>"Then I am-a take-a the switch iron and change-a the tracks." "You
don't have a switch iron either."</p><p>"Well, in that case," decided the Italian, "I'm gonna call up-a my
wife, Maria."</p><p>"What has your wife got to do with two trains coming at each other at
a hundred miles an hour?" exclaimed the man in charge of hiring.</p><p>"I tell-a her to come down 'cos she has-a gone see the biggest-a
mess-a in the whole world!"</p><p>YOU can do whatsoever you can do, and when nothing can be done it is
better to call the wife and see -- and enjoy it! Learn to enjoy not only
the pleasures of life but the pains too, not only the ecstasies but the
agonies too. And the person who can enjoy the agonies is liberated.</p><p>The fifth question Question 5</p><p>OSHO, DURING THE TWO MONTHS THAT I HAVE BEEN HERE, I OFTEN FEEL</p><p>THE THREAT OF A NEW KIND OF TOTALITARIANISM. IT IS CONTINUALLY</p><p>PRESENTED AS THE SOLUTION: BE TOTAL IN THIS AND THAT EVEN IN NOT</p><p>BEING TOTAL. BEING TOTAL, WITHOUT FRAGMENTATION ANY MORE, IS</p><p>NOT THAT A FINAL STATE, THE LAST STAGE ON THE WAY? SO IS NOT THIS</p><p>ADAGE CREATING A NEW IDEAL WITH ALL ITS FRUSTRATIONS AND</p><p>NEUROSIS TO FOLLOW? ANYWAY, FOR ME, NOT BEING A SUPERMAN, IT IS</p><p>VERY RARE THAT I AM ABLE TO DO, TO EXIST, TO FEEL MYSELF TOTAL IN</p><p>ANYTHING, AND I HAVE NO REASON TO HOPE THAT IT WILL EVER HAPPEN</p><p>AS A CONTINUOUS STATE. SINCE IT SEEMS TO BE THE CONDITION FOR THE</p><p>THINGS THAT ARE PROMISED HERE IS THERE STILL ANY HOPE FOR ME?</p><p>Eduard Povel,</p><p>TOTALITY IS NOT A GOAL. Totality is not perfectionism. Totality is
simply a vision of seeing the life in a different light. For example,
you are angry. You can be half-heartedly angry, then the remaining part
that has not been expressed will remain in you as a poison.</p><p>And if again and again this has been done, you go on accumulating
poison in yourself.</p><p>Then a moment comes when you may not be angry in particular, but you
are still in anger for no reason at all. That's how people are -- they
are just angry, illogically angry, because right now there is no reason
to be angry, but all the anger that they have repressed in the past has
accumulated, has gone deep into their bloodstream, has poisoned them,
has become toxic. It has created a certain musculature, a wrong kind of
musculature in their bodies. And that is going to destroy many many
beautiful things in their lives.</p><p>If such a man is going to see a sunset, he will not see any beauty in
it. He is in such a rage! If such a man goes to listen to music, he will
not be able to listen to</p><p>it, because to be able to listen to great music you need a relaxed
state. He cannot relax. He is carrying so many tensions, the whole
life's accumulated tensions.…</p><p>When I say be total I simply mean... I am not giving you a superhuman
ideal. I am simply giving you a very human vision that when you are
angry, then BE angry! Then don't repress it. If it is too risky to be
angry with somebody, then go into your room and be angry alone, but
express it. Beat the pillow, shout at the walls, make a picture of your
wife and beat it! But do something -- do what you really wanted to do
with the wife.</p><p>It is really a good idea to have an effigy of your wife, or if you
are a wife then an effigy of your husband, so whenever the need arises
you can go and be as nasty as you feel like being -- and with no danger
of retaliation. And you will be surprised: after beating your wife, in
her absence, after shouting nasty things, using four-letter words, then
when you see your wife you will be surprised -- you will feel compassion
for her. You may even feel ready to apologize. You may be able to see
her in a different way, because you are no longer carrying that subtle
layer of anger -- it has been released. You may be able to see her face
again after years.</p><p>When I say be total I simply mean don't repress things, because the
repressed things are bound to rebound on you, those repressed things are
going to take revenge, they are going to explode with vengeance one day.
Those repressed feelings are creating all kinds of neurotic, psychotic
people in the world. To be total is not a goal! To be total is only a
way of life.</p><p>And you say: BEING TOTAL WITHOUT 'FRAGMENTATION ANY MORE, IS NOT</p><p>THAT A FINAL STATE...?</p><p>Yes, it is a final state too -- but the first step is the last step,
and the beginning is the end.</p><p>It is a means and an end too. You have to begin. I know you cannot be
total right now.</p><p>Slowly slowly, you will be able to become total, because the society
has not allowed you to be total in anything; it has allowed you only so
far. It has made you very lukewarm; it has taken away all passionate
energy from your being.</p><p>Hence, you don't really love madly, you don't really go into anger
madly, you don't share totally, you cannot commune</p><p>-- everything is just so-so. And, hence, so much dust has gathered on
your face.</p><p>Totality has to be started; it is the beginning and the end too. In
the beginning it is going to be difficult because you will be going
against the current of the society, but that's what sannyas is: taking
courage to be oneself And I don't expect you to become total right now,
But the decision will help. If you decide to be total, slowly slowly you
will be more and more total, degrees and degrees, by degrees one day you
will attain to the hundred-degree point.</p><p>And the miracle is: when one can go into one's emotions a hundred
percent, all that is wrong starts disappearing. That is the miracle! And
all that is right starts growing. A really total person will not be able
to be angry. In the beginning when you start you will be more and more
angry, but soon the point comes when you are totally angry and you have
seen the naked futility of anger, the utter absurdity of anger, the
insanity of anger --</p><p>When YOU have seen it -- not because Buddha has said so or I have
said so -- when you have seen it, it will drop. The seeing is enough.
You need not drop it: it drops of its own accord.</p><p>A total person will be able to love and will be unable to hate. A
total person will be able to be compassionate and will be unable to be
angry. But that is the end. I am not telling you to be a Buddha right
now. But one has to begin somewhere; one has to start moving in the
direction of being a Buddha.</p><p>You are right: it is the final state, the last stage on the way. But
the w ay is also part of the last stage. The way and the goal are not
separate. The goal is just the other end of the way. And the beginning
is THIS end and the goal is THAT end, and the way joins both, is the
bridge.</p><p>Eduard, I am not teaching you any kind of perfectionism, I am not
saying you any ideals.</p><p>Totality is certainly not all ideal -- it sounds as if it is. It is
just a different style of life.</p><p>Right now you are living a life-style which can be called partial --
only parts of</p><p>your being are allowed to surface, only the tip of the iceberg. You
are living in fragments, you are living split. This is a kind of
schizophrenic life.</p><p>Misery is bound to be the outcome of it -- misery and only misery.
Bliss is the consequence of being one, integrated. That's exactly the
meaning of the word 'yoga': union, integration, oneness.</p><p>YOU say: I HAVE NO REASON TO HOPE THAT IT WILL EVER HAPPEN AS A
CONTINUOUS STATE.</p><p>Who is telling you to make it a continuous state? Why do we always
think of the future?</p><p>Why do we make things unnecessarily difficult? For a certain reason
-- there is a motive.</p><p>First you make something very difficult, then you can say, "This is
not possible. I cannot do it," and it is finished. There is no need for
it to be total, there is no need for it to be continuous.</p><p>That's why it looks contradictory, paradoxical, but I say to you that
when sometimes you are not total then be total in it -- then don't be
total! Then accept it -- that "This is the moment when I am not total."
Then don't hide it, then don't fight it. If it is not possible, it is
not possible. Don't feel guilty for it; you are not committing a sin. It
is your life: if you want to be total sometimes, good; if sometimes you
enjoy not being total, for a change, perfectly good!</p><p>The sixth question Question 6</p><p>OSHO, THE RAJKOT NEWSPAPER, JAI HIND, RECENTLY QUOTED THE PRIME</p><p>MINISTER, MORARJI DESAI, AS SAYING, WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT</p><p>WESTERNERS COMING TO THIS ASHRAM, THAT THEY WERE THE RUBBISH</p><p>OF THE WEST THOSE THROWN OUT FROM THEIR SOCIETIES.

HE SAID HE DID NOT WANT ANY SUCH</p><p>UNIVERSITY TO COME INTO BEING, AND THAT YOU ONLY TALKED OF SEX</p><p>THROUGHOUT THE DAY.</p><p>HE ALSO EXPRESSED HIS GREAT RESENTMENT OF SUCH OBSCENE</p><p>INSTITUTIONS, AND SAID HE WOULD LIKE THEM CLOSED DOWN ALL OVER</p><p>THE WORLD AND THAT THEY WERE NOT AT ALL NECESSARY. DO YOU</p><p>HAVE ANY COMMENT?</p><p>Krishna Prem, IT IS JUST BULLSHIT! The last question</p><p>Question 7</p><p>OSHO WHY DO YOU USE SUCH DIRECT LANGUAGE AGAINST THE POLITICIANS?
CAN'T YOU BE A LITTLE INDIRECT AND DIPLOMATIC?</p><p>Girish,</p><p>I DON'T EXPECT THE POLITICIANS to understand even the direct
language. If I am indirect there is no hope that they will ever
understand. They do not understand even my absolutely direct, frank,
blunt language. I don't mince words. I simply say it as it is. That too
they cannot understand.</p><p>In fact, only the third-rate minds become interested in politics.
Anyone who has some kind of intelligence will do something else. He may
become a scientist, he may become a poet, a dancer, a musician. He may
become a mystic. Why in the world would he like to become a politician?
That is only for those who have no other possibility of expressing
themselves, who have no other intelligence.</p><p>The politician needs no other qualification, no talent. In fact, the
more unintelligent he is, the greater is the possibility of his being
successful.</p><p>A tourist was visiting New Delhi. Walking on a side street late one
evening, the visitor was held up by a bandit. "Give me your money!" he
threatened, "or I will blow out your brains."</p><p>"Blow away..." said the tourist.</p><p>In New Delhi you can live without brains but not without money. I
have to be direct. And I am not a politician, so why should I be
diplomatic? Truth is never diplomatic -- it is straight.</p><p>And the politicians cannot understand what I am doing here, and I
don't expect them to understand. It will be great if they simply ignore
us. That's enough. If they forget all about us. that is more than can be
expected.</p><p>A German philosopher pleaded with Adolf Hitler not to mistreat the
Jews if for no other reason, he said, than just because they are so
smart.</p><p>"What makes you think the Jews are so smart?" asked the dictator.
"Come, and I will show you. '</p><p>He took the Nazi leader to Gutman's Gift Shop and said, "Ask him for
a lefthanded teapot."</p><p>The Fuhrer did. Gutman went to the back of the store, picked up a
teapot, turned it around, and returned. "You are in luck," said Gutman,
handing the teapot to Hitler, "I just happen to have one left."</p><p>Back out on the street the philosopher said, "You see, that's what I
mean about the Jews being so smart."</p><p>"What is so smart about that?" exclaimed Hitler. "He just happened to
have one left."</p><p>You can't expect politicians to understand much. They are bound to
misunderstand even my direct statements. And if I start making indirect
statements they will create more complexities. Then there will be more
chances of misunderstandinng.</p><p>Levi closed his shop Friday night and headed for temple services not

TEMPLE, OR ON A BALCONY,</p><p>IN THE HOT FIELDS, OR IN A WALLED GARDEN, MY OWN LORD IS MAKING LOVE
WITH ME.</p><p>WHAT IS GOD? THE MOMENT THE QUESTION IS ASKED, the idea of a</p><p>person arises in the mind -- and God is not a person. Those who think
of God as a person start, from the very beginning, moving in a wrong
direction. They will never arrive. They will go round and round in
circles, they will travel much, but they will never reach anywhere.</p><p>If the first step is wrong then all else goes wrong. The first step
has to be absolutely right, because the first step is half the journey
already. In fact, as fact, as you are concerned, the first step is the
whole of the journey -- because the other step is to be taken towards
you by God.</p><p>You take one step, he takes the other step... and the meeting. And
the distance between you and God is only two steps. The initiative has
to be from your side.</p><p>God is not a person, but that's what you have been told down the
ages. God is a presence.</p><p>God is not substance but significance. Once God is understood as
significance, your life starts changing. Then you don't argue about God,
whether he exists or not; then you are no more interested in theology.
The whole of theology becomes rubbish. Then you start moving in a
totally different way, in an altogether different dimension.</p><p>If God is significance, then you have to create a certain meaning in
your life, because only meaning can meet the meaning. You have to create
significance in your life, because only significance can meet the
significance. You have to become more aware, more loving, more
aesthetic, more sensitive.</p><p>If God were a person it would have been a totally different approach.
God is not a person but only a fragrance. You will need great
sensitivity to comprehend that significance, that fragrance, that
music.</p><p>In these sutras today, Kabir is talking about something very
fundamental. Listen to his words -- don't only hear: listen. And don't
only listen: meditate with him, go with him. He is not a philosopher, he
is not propounding a system of thought</p><p>-- he is a poet. He is singing his own experience. He is not
concerned with concepts. He is pouring his heart into his songs, he is
pouring himself into his words.</p><p>You have to be very sensitive to understand this great poetic
expression of mysticism, this great poetic expression of religion. And
religion can only be</p><p>expressed through poetry, through music, through dance. Any other way
of expressing religion falls short, is inadequate. The mysterious has to
be indicated only by something mysterious. God cannot be approached
through the mind of calculation, mathematics. It is not possible to
approach God through prose. The door opens only when you approach him
through poetry.</p><p>Poetry is more liquid, more vague, not so solid as prose. Prose says
something clearly, poetry only hints. Prose shouts, poetry only
whispers. Prose is for the mundane world, poetry is for the sacred.</p><p>So whenever it happens that a person becomes a Buddha, his
expression, without any effort, becomes that of poetry. He may not
compose poetry literally, but whatsoever he says, whatsoever he is, is
poetry.</p><p>Kabir was absolutely illiterate, never went to any school, was not
able to read or write; still, when it happened, he exploded in great
poetry.When the experience arose in his being, when the doors opened and
mysteries were revealed, he bloomed in thousands of flowers. No other
poet can be compared with Kabir. There have been greater poets than
Kabir, but they were mere poets -- talented, with great art, but Kabir
has a personal experience of the divine which is missing in other poets.
They may be talking about God, but it is mere talk. With Kabir it is not
just talking: it is his heartfelt experience -- it is existential.</p><p>HAVE YOU HEARD THE MUSIC THAT NO FINGERS ENTER INTO?</p><p>The original is:</p><p>SUNTA NAHIN DHUN KI KHABAR, ANAKAD KA BAJA BAJTA?</p><p>SUNTA NAHIN DHUN KI KHABAR...</p><p>Why are you not listening to the inner music which is constantly
arising? You are made of it! It is not something foreign to you. It does
not come from the outside. It is the music of your very existence, of
your being; it is the music of your inner harmony, it is the music of
your inner rhythm.</p><p>SUNTA NAHIN DHUN KI KHABAR...</p><p>Why don't you listen to the inner rhythm of your being?</p><p>Where do you go on rushing to? And you are searching for this inner
rhythm --</p><p>sometimes in money, sometimes in power, sometimes in prestige,
sometimes in so many kinds of relationships. You go on begging. You want
to know something of the transcendental, you are thirsty for the
transcendental.</p><p>And once in a while, even in ordinary life, it happens. You how those
few moments when suddenly one day you wake up in the morning and
everything seems to fit perfectly. The birds are singing, the air is
fragrant, the sun is rising, and suddenly you feel that all is quiet.
You are no longer separate for a moment... you feel a great joy arising
in you for no reason at all. You suddenly feel vibrant, utterly
rejuvenated, at home. Maybe the night's deep sleep and rest, maybe the
beautiful morning, the song of the birds, the fresh air, the dewdrops on
the grass leaves shining in the early sun -- all this created the
context. Not by your effort, but just by accident. you fell in harmony
with yourself and with existence. And remember, it happens always
together: whenever you fall in harmony with yourself, you fall in
harmony with existence too.</p><p>Harmony has two sides: the individual and the universal. If the
individual is in harmony, then there is no reason why he should not be
in harmony with the whole. If inside you all conflict has disappeared,
even for a single moment, in that moment you are part of the whole, you
are no more an island, you are no more separate. All walls have suddenly
disappeared; you are no more imprisoned.</p><p>In that moment you know the glory, the splendour, that life is. That
splendour is God, that feel is God. That experience of harmony is God.
God is not a person but the presence that is felt when you are in
harmony and you are also in harmony with existence -- that accord. That
accord is called DHUN.</p><p>SUNTA NAHIN DHUN KI KHABAR...</p><p>Listen to that accord! which is available every moment of your life.
It happens only accidentally, because you have not prepared yourself for
it, to receive it consciously. So it happens only once in a while.</p><p>Once Leo Tolstoy was asked, "How many experiences did you have of
divine ecstasy in your life?"</p><p>He started crying, great tears started rolling down from his eyes. He
said, Not more than seven in my life of seventy years, but I am grateful
for those seven moments. I am miserable also, because in those moments
it was so self-evident that is could be the flavour of my whole life. In
those moments I was so certain that this could be my experience day in,
day out, year in, year out -- this could spread over my whole life, this
could become my flavour. But it didn't happen. Those moments came on
their own and they went on their own. But I am still grateful to God
that even without any conscious effort on my part, once in a while he
has been knocking at my doors."</p><p>THIS HAPPENS TO EVERYBODY -- it happens in spite of you. If you look
back you can remember a few moments.… and those will be the moments when
you were relaxed, those will be the moments when there was no particular
desire in your mind, when you were not worried, when you were not tense,
when somehow you simply were.</p><p>Watch these sudden accidental moments minutely, because there is the
secret key. That's how the fundamentals of religion have been
discovered: watching these sudden moments which come and go, and one
never knows why they come and why they go, watching the context, the
space in which they happen, people started trying to create that
context.</p><p>If it happens in a relaxed state, when you are very loose, non-tense,
then you can create the context! You can relax. If it happens to you
while swimming, then you can swim and create the context. If it happens
to you while running... and it happens to different people in different
ways. Many runners know it, that beyond a certain limit if you go on
running, go on running, go on running, suddenly it happens -- because
man's energies have three layers.</p><p>The first layer is only for day-to-day activities; it is a very thin
layer. It is enough for your office, wife, children -- the ordinary
life. The second layer is for emergencies: your house is on fire; you
may have been feeling very tired after the whole day's work and you were
coming home and hoping to have a good rest, and suddenly when you come
home your house is on fire. Immediately, all fatigue disappears -- you
are no more tired. You have forgotten all about rest, and the whole
night you try to put the fire out. And even after the whole night's</p><p>work, you are not tired. It was not the ordinary level of energy that
worked</p><p>-- that was exhausted -- the emergency layer started working.</p><p>And the third layer is deeper than that. If you go on and on For
example, if for</p><p>one day, two days, three days, you go on working, then the emergency
level will also be finished -</p><p>- and then you come in contact with the cosmic layer. And that is the
source of life, and that is inexhaustible. And whenever you are in
contact with it, tremendous joy starts overflowing you.</p><p>It happens to joggers, to runners, to swimmers sometimes. First layer
finished, then the second layer, and if you go on running the second is
also finished -- and the moment you are in contact with the third,
tremendous ecstasy happens for no reason at all.</p><p>It may happen to you while making love. It may happen to you while
listening to music.</p><p>It may happen to you while simply lying in your bed doing nothing. It
may happen to you while painting, absorbed, utterly absorbed in it. Or
it may happen in a thousand and one ways. But watch: whenever it
happens, whenever that tremendous blissful moment comes to you, when God
knocks on your door, watch in what context it is happening. Be
alert!</p><p>Look around -- in what space it is happening. And then you have the
key. Whenever you will be able to create that context, that space, the
moment will come again.</p><p>You cannot make it happen, but you can make yourself available for it
to happen. You cannot force it to happen, but you can create all that is
necessary for it to happen. It is not a doing on your part: it is a
happening. But, still, you can play a great role. That's how all
techniques of meditation have been developed. That's how Yoga came into
existence.</p><p>SUNTA NAHIN DHUN KI KHABAR...</p><p>That accord is present in you, because without it you cannot be
alive. That music is already there, flowing underground in you, because
that music is your</p><p>connection with the whole. Once it is cut you will be dead. You are
alive -- that is enough proof that the music is happening. The only
thing is to go deep inside your own being and to find WHERE it is
happening.</p><p>HAVE YOU HEARD THE MUSIC THAT NO FINGERS ENTER INTO?</p><p>And this is a music that is not created by fingers on any musical
instrument. There is no musical instrument within you, and there is
nobody playing on the instrument. It is pure music.</p><p>The Indian mystics use a special word for it: ANAHAD KA BAJA BAJITA
-- ANAHAD</p><p>-- it is boundless, and it is uncreated. It is the sound of one hand
clapping. But the Indian mystics go a little deeper; they say there is
not even one hand clapping -- there is neither hand nor instrument, but
pure music, just music.</p><p>The experience of the mystics is that life consists of the stuff
called music. Just as physics says life consists of electrons,
electricity, mystics say life consists of music. And in a way they are
both right, because music is nothing but a certain vibration of
electricity, and it may be true vice versa also: electricity may be
nothing but a certain density of music, of sound.</p><p>HAVE YOU HEARD THE MUSIC THAT NO FINGERS ENTER INTO?</p><p>KABIR IS TALKING TO HIS DISCIPLES who have come to seek God. Somebody
must have asked him about God, and he is talking about music. To talk
about God is almost useless, but to talk about music is certainly of
great significance. If you can hear your inner music, you will know God
is.</p><p>FAR INSIDE THE HOUSE ENTANGLED MUSIC -- WHAT IS THE SENSE OF LEAVING
YOUR HOUSE?</p><p>And Kabir says: Where are you going to find God? People go to Kashi
and to Kaaba, and people go to Jerusalem and to Tibet, and people go to
all kinds of</p><p>places in search of some significance. They are feeling that their
life is meaningless, they are feeling that their life is empty, they are
feeling that their life is nothing but a long long tale told by an
idiot. They know that their life is just noise, meaningless, gibberish.
They know that deep down there is nothing but a kind of hollowness. And
they search: there must be some source somewhere which can quench their
thirst. There must be some place somewhere where they can encounter God,
where they can attain to some significance, where their life can have
some meaning. But this search is futile. They will be frustrated again
and again -- because the truth they are searching for is already within
their being. What they are seeking is in the seeker himself; the sought
is in the seeker. You need not go anywhere. You simply have to learn how
not to go anywhere.</p><p>The greatest art is just to be, without going anywhere. Not going to
the past, not going to the future, not going into desires, into
psychological spaces, into psychic travels -- not to go anywhere, just
to be. And right now! if you are just here... immediately something is
felt, something which is intangible. You cannot show it to anybody else;
you cannot share your experience with somebody who has not known it. But
your whole being starts feeling a kind of intoxicatedness, a
drunkenness. You become full of juice, you become full of aliveness, and
a very indirect, subtle, delicate experience of the presence of
something bigger than you</p><p>-- that's what God is all about. FAR INSIDE THE HOUSE...</p><p>The original is:</p><p>RAS MAND MANDIR BAJTA BAHAR SUNE TO KYA HUA?</p><p>Kabir says: That music is already happening inside your own temple.
Kabir calls you 'the temple' -- except for your body there is no other
temple in the world. Your bodies are temples, sacred places, because the
holiest of the holy resides in you. And look at what the priests have
been telling you, what your so-called saints have been telling you. They
have been teaching you life-negative attitudes, body-negative attitudes.
They have been telling you that the body is the culprit, that the body
is the source of sin. They have been telling you to torture the body, to
destroy the body. They have been teaching you that unless you</p><p>destroy your body totally you will not be able to know God.</p><p>The truth is just the contrary: unless you love your body immensely,
respect your body immensely, you will not be able to know God at all --
because the body is his outer expression. If the body is the temple,
then God is the deity inside it.</p><p>RAS MAND MANDIR BAJTA...</p><p>Within the temple of your body the music is already happening -- just
go in. And the word RAS has to be understood. RAS literally means juice.
And you will be surprised to know that the mystics of this country have
called God the ultimate juice: RASAO VAI SAHA -- he is the ultimate
juice. But if you go to your so- called saints, you will find them very
dry, with no juice at all. You will find them almost dead, with no life
flowing in them. And they have destroyed their bodies; they are living a
kind of death. But this is thought to be very respectable. What has
really happened? What has gone wrong? Why have these pathological
people, mentally deranged people, psychologically ill people, become so
dominant? Why have they possessed religion?</p><p>The neurotic people have one quality in them: the quality of being
fanatics. Only neurotics can be fanatics, and it is very difficult to
fight with fanatics. Wherever a fanatic is, sooner or later he is going
to become a leader. He is so troublesome, he is such a trouble-maker,
that you have to make him a leader; that is just to pacify him. He will
only be at rest when he is at the top, when he is the boss.</p><p>Neurotics have a tendency to become leaders. Adolf Hitler was a
neurotic, and became one of the greatest leaders of human history. He
was a madman, but madmen have a few qualities in them which no sane man
can ever have: they compete, and they compete with their total energy,
and they compete madly. Because they are so mad, they don't think, they
act. While the sane person thinks, the mad person acts. The sane person
goes on thinking and the mad person has already reached and acted and
done. The sane person thinks of consequences, the mad person thinks
nothing -- he simply rushes in.</p><p>Adolf Hitlers become leaders in politics, and the same kind of people
become leaders in religion too. And the pathological people also have a
tendency to become organized. The sane person wants to be left alone
because he enjoys his aloneness; he wants his own space, he wants
freedom -- freedom from the crowd. And the mad person wants the crowd.
Left alone he becomes disturbed;</p><p>in his aloneness he starts seeing his madness. He goes always into
the crowd; he wants to live with the crowd twenty-four hours a day -- he
is a lover of the crowd.</p><p>The sane person moves in solitude and the insane person searches for
the crowd. And your religions are nothing but crowds. Christianity,
Hinduism, Islam, Jainism -- different crowds. When Mohammed became
enlightened, he was alone, meditating in the mountains. When Buddha
became enlightened he was alone, meditating by the side of the River
Niranjana, under a tree -- alone. When Mahavira became enlightened he
was absolutely alone in the forest, standing underneath a tree, naked in
the sun.</p><p>Enlightenment has happened to people when they were utterly alone.
But leadership does not come that way. Leadership comes when you move
into the crowd. Not only that: when you fulfill the expectations of the
crowd -- stupid expectations, superstitious expectations, but you have
to fulfill the expectations of the crowd -- then you become the leader
religious or political. Mad people have a great organizing capacity.
Because they fulfill the expectations of the crowd, the crowd looks up
to them, the crowd respects them, and the crowd is afraid -- everybody
is afraid -- and the crowd wants to be organized because in organization
there seems to be power.</p><p>An NAACP official telephoned the Library of Congress and told the
chief librarian that the library had eighteen thousand books with the
word 'nigger' in them and that all the books had to be removed in a
week.</p><p>"But," protested the librarian, "we have fifty thousand volumes with
the word 'bastard' in them."</p><p>"I know," said the official, "but those bastards are not
organized."</p><p>In this world, organization is power, and mad people have a great
magnetic force to organize. They cannot be alone, they seek others; and
others who cannot be alone, they are also seeking. It becomes a mutual
arrangement.</p><p>Religions, at the source, are born out of a meditative aloneness, but
the moment it becomes known that a Buddha has happened, the mad people
start organizing, the mad people start gathering a crowd. And that crowd
finally crystallizes into Hinduism, Mohammedanism, Christianity. All
their notions are based not in the enlightenment of their founders, real
founders, no, but in the pseudo founders,</p><p>the priests.</p><p>And these priests have been telling you that life is irreligious,
that the body has to be denied, it is not a temple, it is not a place to
be worshipped in.</p><p>Kabir is saying a totally different thing, and that's what my
emphasis is: the body is sacred -- because ALL IS sacred!</p><p>HAVE YOU HEARD THE MUSIC THAT NO FINGERS ENTER INTO?</p><p>FAR INSIDE THE HOUSE ENTANGLED MUSIC --</p><p>WHAT IS THE SENSE OF LEAVING YOUR HOUSE?</p><p>Where are you going? You need not leave the body, you need not leave
anything, you need not renounce anything! Remember -- Kabir never
renounced anything. He lived a very ordinary life just as everybody else
lives -- the life of a householder. He was a father, a husband, and his
whole life he continued to work. He was a weaver -- he continued to
weave clothes. Even when he had thousands of disciples. And many times
his disciples would come to him and say, You need not work at all. We
are ready to provide everything for you, and your needs are not many.
Why do you go on working?</p><p>And Kabir would laugh and say, "You don't understand. I work for God,
I weave clothes for God -- because the customers who come to purchase
clothes from me are divine. How can I stop my work?"</p><p>This quality is true religiousness. And this quality is possible only
if you are in love with life, and to be in love with life creates RAS --
juice. Then you don't become dry, then you don't become a desert, then
you become an oasis</p><p>The so-called religious people of this country are against me because
I am teaching you the way of RAS -- the way of life, love, juice, music
-- because I am teaching you to become an oasis, not a desert; because I
would like you to be in a constant rejoicing; because I am not teaching
you renunciation but rejoicing, all the people who have been carrying
this nonsense idea of renouncing the</p><p>world are bound to be against me. That is natural. It is expected.
This has been happening always, and it seems, unfortunately, that man
has not learnt anything at all down the ages. It is exactly the same
today as it was in the days of Buddha, as it was in the days of Jesus,
as it was in the days of Kabir.</p><p>SUPPOSE YOU SCRUB YOUR ETHICAL SKIN UNTIL IT SHINES,</p><p>BUT INSIDE THERE IS NO MUSIC, THEN WHAT?</p><p>MORALITY IS NOT RELIGION, although a religious person is always moral
-- but not vice versa: a moral person need not be religious. A religious
person is necessarily moral, because religion means experience of the
divine -- one who has experienced the presence of God, how can he be
immoral? In fact, he is the criterion, the decisive factor as to what is
moral.</p><p>Whatsoever an enlightened person does is moral; there is no other way
to decide. It is not that he is thing to do that which is moral --
whatsoever he does is moral. He cannot do any harm to anybody; he is a
blessing to existence. When God has blessed him, what else is left for
him, except to be a blessing to the existence? What God has given to
him, he goes on giving to everybody else. His heart is full of bliss,
and the bliss starts overflowing. That overflowing bliss is real
morality.</p><p>Morality means compassion, morality means love, morality means
creativity; morality means making the world a little more beautiful than
you found it, leaving it a little more beautiful, giving it a new plane,
a new level, a new dimension of existence.</p><p>The immoral person is destructive; because he is miserable he can
only share his misery with others. Remember, you can give to others only
that which you have. If you are miserable, whatsoever you say is
immaterial, you will make others miserable. If you are blissful, you
need not say anything -- you will make others blissful. Your very
presence will trigger some blissfulness in their being. Your very
presence will create a synchronicity in others. Your music, your juice,
will create ripples of joy -- whoever is close to you will become
infected with your joy, with your ecstasy, will become drunk --</p><p>and that's what morality is. Kabir says:</p><p>SUPPOSE YOU SCRUB YOUR ETHICAL SKIN UNTIL IT SHINES,</p><p>BUT INSIDE THERE IS NO MUSIC, THEN WHAT?</p><p>Then what is the use of it? Yes, that can be done, that is being
done. There are people who go on cultivating character, who go on
cultivating morality. And they become great moralists. puritans, very
righteous. They do only that which is right but it is a forced doing, it
is not spontaneous -- it is not out of their being, it is just a forced
phenomenon. It is a facade. They have created a beautiful curtain around
themselves, behind it is the corpse, the stinking corpse, but on the
surface they have decorated themselves with flowers. And the crowd can
be deceived by them, but deep down they are the same people, even worse,
because all that they are showing on the surface is pseudo. They are
just the opposite inside. They are hypocrites. They say one thing, they
are just the opposite of it; they do one thing, but their being has no
correspondence with it. They are split, they are schizophrenic.</p><p>Because of this cultivated morality, we have put the whole of
humanity in a state of schizophrenia. Everybody is more or less made
into a hypocrite. The society forces you to do it. If you don't do it,
you cannot live, you cannot survive. It has become almost a necessity
that you don't show your reality. You show only that which people want
you to show, and you keep everything else hidden inside. But then your
inner being goes on accumulating poisons and poisons and poisons, and
you live a hell within, decorated with beautiful flowers. And those
flowers are also plastic, because they cannot be true flowers.</p><p>True flowers need roots in your being.</p><p>A really religious person has no morality imposed upon himself. His
morality arises out of his consciousness. He is not trying to do the
right, he is not trying to avoid the wrong -</p><p>- -he simply remains conscious and acts out of his consciousness, and
whatsoever he does is right. In fact, it is impossible to do anything
wrong consciously.</p><p>A beautiful story is told about a great mystic, Nagarjuna: He was a
naked fakir, but he was loved by all real seekers. A queen was also
deeply in love with Nagarjuna. She asked him one day to come to the
palace, to be a guest in the palace. Nagarjuna went. The queen asked him
a favour. Nagarjuna said, "What do you want?" The queen said, "I want
your begging bowl."</p><p>Nagarjuna gave it -- that was the only thing he had -- his begging
bowl. And the queen brought a golden begging bowl, studded with diamonds
and gave it to Nagarjuna. She said, "Now you keep this. I will worship
the begging bowl that you have carried for years</p><p>-- it has some of your vibe. It will become my temple. And a man like
you should not carry an ordinary wooden begging bowl -- keep this golden
one. I have had it made specially for you."</p><p>It was really precious. If Nagarjuna had been an ordinary mystic he
would have said, "I cannot touch it. I have renounced the world." But
for him it was all the same, so he took the bowl.</p><p>When he left the palace, a thief saw him. He could not believe his
eyes: "A naked man with such a precious thing! How long can he protect
it?" So the thief followed.…</p><p>Nagarjuna was staying outside the town in a ruined ancient temple --
no doors, no windows. It was just a ruin. The thief was very happy:
"Soon Nagarjuna will have to go to sleep and there will be no difficulty
-- I will get the bowl."</p><p>The thief was hiding behind a wall just outside the door -- Nagarjuna
threw the bowl outside the door. The thief could not believe what had
happened. Nagarjuna threw it because he had watched the thief coming
behind him, and he knew perfectly well that he was not coming for him --
he was coming for the bowl, "So why unnecessarily let him wait? Be
finished with it so he can go, and I can also rest."</p><p>"Such a precious thing! And Nagarjuna has thrown it so easily." The
thief could not go without thanking him. He knew perfectly well that it
had been thrown for</p><p>him. He peeked in and he said, "Sir, accept my thanks. But you are a
rare being -</p><p>- I cannot believe my eyes. And a great desire has arisen in me. I am
wasting my life by being a thief -- and there are people like you too?
Can I come in and touch your feet?"</p><p>Nagarjuna laughed and he said, "Yes, that's why I threw the bowl
outside -- so that you could come inside."</p><p>The thief was trapped. The thief came in, touched the feet... and at
that moment the thief was very open because he had seen that this man
was no ordinary man. He was very vulnerable, open, receptive, grateful,
mystified, stunned. When he touched the feet, for the first time in his
life he felt the presence of the divine.</p><p>He asked Nagarjuna, "How many lives will it take for me to become
like you?" Nagarjuna said, "How many lives? -- it can happen today, it
can happen now!"</p><p>The thief said, "You must be kidding. How can it happen now? I am a
thief, a well-known thief The whole town knows me, although they have
not yet been able to catch hold of me. Even the king is afraid of me,
because thrice I have entered and stolen from the treasury. They know
it, but they have no proof. I am a master thief -- you may not know
about me because you are a stranger in these parts. How can I be
transformed right now?"</p><p>And Nagarjuna said, "If in an old house for centuries there has been
darkness and you bring a candle, can the darkness say, 'For centuries
and centuries I have been here -- I cannot go out just because you have
brought a candle in. I have lived so long'? Can the darkness give
resistance? Will it make any difference whether the darkness is one day
old or millions of years old.</p><p>The thief could see the point: darkness cannot resist light; when
light comes, darkness disappears. Nagarjuna said, You may have been in
darkness for millions of lives -- that doesn't matter -- but I can give
you a secret, you can light a candle in your being."</p><p>And the thief said, "What about my profession? Have I to leave
it?"</p><p>Nagarjuna said, "That is for you to decide. I am not concerned with
you and your profession I can only give you the secret of how to kindle
a light within your being, and then it is up to you."</p><p>The thief said, "But whenever I have gone to any saints, they always
say, 'First stop stealing -- then only can you be initiated.'" It is
said that Nagarjuna laughed and said,</p><p>"You must have gone to thieves, not to saints. They know nothing. You
just watch your breath -- the ancient method of Buddha -- just watch
your breath coming in, going out.</p><p>Whenever you remember, watch your breath. Even when you go to steal,
when you enter into somebody's house in the night, go on watching your
breath. When you have opened the treasure and the diamonds are there, go
on watching your breath, and do whatsoever you want to do -- but don't
forget watching the breath."</p><p>The thief said, "This seems to be simple. No morality? No character
needed? No other requirement?"</p><p>Nagarjuna said, "Absolutely none -- just watch your breath."</p><p>And after fifteen days the thief was back, but he was a totally
different man. He fell at the feet of Nagarjuna and he said, "You
trapped me, and you trapped me so beautifully that I was not even able
to suspect. I tried for these fifteen days -- it is impossible. If I
watch my breath, I cannot steal. If I steal, I cannot watch my breath.
Watching the breath, I become so silent, so alert, so aware, so
conscious, that even diamonds look like pebbles.</p><p>You have created a difficulty for me, a dilemma. Now what am I
supposed to do?"</p><p>Nagarjuna said, "Get lost! -- whatsoever you want to do. If you want
that silence, that peace, that bliss, that arises in you when you watch
your breath, then choose that. If you think all those diamonds and gold
and silver is more valuable, then choose that. That is for you to
choose! Who am I to interfere in your life?"</p><p>The man said, "I cannot choose to be unconscious again. I have never
known such moments. Accept me as one of your disciples, initiate
me."</p><p>Nagarjuna said, "I have initiated you already."</p><p>Religion is based not in morality but in meditation. Religion is
rooted not in</p><p>character but in consciousness. A really religious person has no
character at all -- he is characterless.</p><p>But let me define what I mean by 'characterless': I don't mean the
ordinary meaning that you will find in the dictionary -- because in the
dictionary, the man of bad character is called characterless. That is
wrong, because he has a character</p><p>-- maybe it is bad, but he is not characterless. Somebody has good
character, somebody has bad character -- both have characters. The
sinner and the saint, both have characters, but the really religious man
is characterless. He is neither good nor bad -- he is beyond. He has no
character because he does not function out of his past: he acts
moment-to-moment, he acts spontaneously; he has no ready-made formula,
he has no routine. He does not act out of habits -- and that's what
character is: creating good habits is good character, creating bad
habits is bad character. Creating consciousness, not habits, is
religiousness.</p><p>SUPPOSE YOU SCRUB YOUR ETHICAL SKIN UNTIL IT SHINES,</p><p>BUT INSIDE THERE IS NO MUSIC, THEN WHAT?</p><p>You can go on scrubbing your ethical skin, you can go on polishing
your morality, you can become a really polished man, but if inside there
is no music, if meditation has not happened, if you have not heard the
unheard, if you have not seen the unseen, if you have not penetrated
into the unknowable, if that soundless sound is not heard, it is all
futile.</p><p>You are simply wasting your time. A Zen story:</p><p>A disciple is meditating and he has been meditating for at least
twenty years. He has been doing all kinds of things: yoga postures,
meditative techniques. One day the Master appears, and the disciple is
sitting like a Buddha, absolutely silent -- at least on the outside --
unmoving like a marble statue. And the Master starts rubbing a brick on
a stone just in front of him. The Master creates so much noise by
rubbing the brick on the stone that the disciple has to open his eyes a
little bit and see who is creating the nuisance.</p><p>Seeing that the Master himself is doing this, he cannot believe it. A
Master is not supposed to disturb the disciple while he is meditating.
What kind of Master is he? But a Master is a Master, so you cannot be
rude to him. He waits, but how long can you wait?</p><p>Constant rubbing of the brick on the stone -- his teeth are getting
on edge. Finally he says, "Stop it! What are you doing?"</p><p>And the Master says, "And what have you been doing for twenty years?
Scrubbing, scrubbing... trying to polish your mind? That you call
meditation? Your postures, your techniques -- they are all mind-based. I
am trying to make a mirror of this brick!"</p><p>The disciple says, "That is impossible. You can go on rubbing, but
the brick will never become a mirror."</p><p>And the Master says, "That's what I have come to say to you. Twenty
years you have been rubbing, scrubbing, polishing, and the mind has not
become meditation and the mind has not become a mirror. Drop the mind!
Don't cultivate it."</p><p>By dropping the mind it becomes a mirror. Mind itself never becomes a
mirror. Mind is the barrier. Hidden behind the mind is your
consciousness. And once you enter behind the mind you hear the music.
That music transforms you into a new being -- it is a rebirth.</p><p>MOHAMMED'S SON PORES OVER WORDS, AND POINTS OUT THIS</p><p>AND THAT,</p><p>BUT IF HIS CHEST IS NOT SOAKED DARK WITH LOVE, THEN WHAT?</p><p>KABIR SAYS THIS IS SO WITH EVERYBODY -- the Hindu pundit goes on
speculating upon words, playing upon words. The Mohammedan scholar,
Mohammed's son, PORES OVER WORDS.… Words have become so important that
we have forgotten that we have to enter into a wordless state of</p><p>consciousness. Go on repeating the Koran, or the Bible, or the Vedas,
and it is of no use at all, because you will only be gathering more and
more knowledge -- all borrowed. And a truth borrowed becomes a lie. A
truth expressed in words immediately loses its truthfulness. Words are
too small; they cannot contain the great sky of the truth within
themselves. They crush the truth, they destroy it.</p><p>And when words reach you, you will give a meaning to them which is
yours.</p><p>Krishna speaks, Jesus speaks, I am speaking to you... if here there
are two thousand people, do you think everybody is hearing the same
thing? There are two thousand meanings. The speaker is one, my meaning
is one, but immediately I assert it it becomes two thousand -- two
thousand meanings.</p><p>A shaggy tale used by New Testament scholars to poke a little fun at
their more skeptical associates begins when several archaeologists
working near Jerusalem unearth some human skeletal remains. Upon
examination they prove to be the bones of Jesus.</p><p>Overwhelmed by the burden of such unsettling knowledge, the
archaeologists decide to inform the Pope. The Pope, of course, is
shocked. What does this mean for the future of the Christian faith?</p><p>If those bones are really those of Jesus, that means he was never
resurrected, that means the resurrection was false, that the whole story
was invented. And with the resurrection disappearing the whole ground
underneath Christianity will disappear.</p><p>Before releasing this information to the press and allowing it to be
sensationally exposed to the stunned eyes of the faithful, the Holy
Father determines to call a council of the world's great theologians to
see if they can help him understand and interpret this calamitous event.
What is more, because the implications of the news obviously affect all
Christians, it seems wise to make this an ecumenical council, one to
which theologians of all denominations will be invited. Slowly and
painfully, his Holiness works his way down the list of theologians,
making telephone calls to each of them. All are heard to make the
appropriate gasps of dismay, after which they promise to hasten to Rome
for the conference.</p><p>The last name on the Pope s list is that of a German New Testament
scholar with a reputation for being highly skeptical with respect to all
manner of historical</p><p>information about Jesus. The Holy Father debates with himself whether
this gentleman should be informed, but finally, in the interests of
ecumenism and because in this case such an already formed attitude of
skepticism might actually be of some use, he makes the telephone call.
The German critic, instead of being overwhelmed by the news that
Jesus'</p><p>bones had not been resurrected, registers his surprise in a fashion
which takes the Pope's own breath away.</p><p>"Ach so," the scholar responds, "then he did live!"</p><p>One is worried about resurrection -- the same news -- but the other's
response is totally different. His worry is, "Ach so, then he did live!"
If the bones are genuine, then Jesus becomes a historical figure.</p><p>Whenever you hear something it is always from your background that
you hear it; it is your background that interprets it. The meaning is
given by you.</p><p>"Young man said the judge, looking sternly at the defendant, "it is
alcohol and alcohol alone that is responsible for your present sorry
state!"</p><p>"I am glad to hear you say that," replied Mooney with a sigh of
relief, "Everybody else says it is all my fault!"</p><p>It is natural that words will be interpreted by each person according
to his own past.</p><p>That's why it is so much insisted on again and again by me to please
listen to me without bringing in your past, listen to me without any
background; listen to me not as Christians, Hindus and Mohammedans,
otherwise you will miss it. Not only will you miss it: you will
misunderstand it.</p><p>Listen to me as you listen to music or the sound of running water or
the wind passing through the pine trees, and then there is a possibility
of some communion happening, a possibility that some meaning that I am
trying to convey reaches you. But it is really difficult. It is one of
the most difficult things in the world to be a disciple.</p><p>To be a disciple means listening without any background, just
listening without interpreting, just listening without for or against,
without believing, without</p><p>disbelieving -</p><p>- a pure kind of listening. And the beauty of truth is that if you
can listen silently with no judgement, if it is true it will ring bells
in your heart. But the bells will be rung in the heart, not in the head.
If it is untrue, no bells will be rung in the heart. You will know
whether it is true or untrue -- not by thinking about it, but just by
listening in total silence.</p><p>MOHAMMED'S SON PORES OVER WORDS, AND POINTS OUT THIS</p><p>AND THAT,</p><p>BUT IF HIS CHEST IS NOT SOAKED DARK WITH LOVE, THEN WHAT?</p><p>Unless your heart responds, the head cannot become a bridge to God.
Your heart needs to be soaked with love. But you don't know anything
about the heart. The society has not allowed you to go through the
heart; it has tried in every way to bypass the heart. The whole effort
of the society is to pull you to the head directly without moving
through the heart, because the ways of the heart are mysterious,
uncontrollable.</p><p>The ways of the head are controllable, manipulatable. Hence the
society is interested in your head, not in your heart. The society wants
you to understand that there is no heart but only the head. The heart is
nothing but a blood-pumping system; that's what the society wants you to
believe This is one of the greatest untruths ever told.</p><p>By 'heart' is not meant the physical part. The physical part is
simply a blood circulation system, but hidden behind the physical, just
corresponding to it, very close to it, behind it, is the real heart.
Just as hidden behind the brain is mind, so hidden behind the lungs is
the heart, hidden behind the body is the soul.</p><p>Don't be finished with the physical. Always remember: corresponding
to each physical phenomenon in you there is a spiritual phenomenon.
Unless your heart starts functioning, IS SOAKED DARK WITH LOVE... and
why dark? Because love has the depth of darkness, the density of
darkness. Love grows in</p><p>mysterious ways not in the light, because light makes everything
demystified. Love is more dark than anything else. It is a dark, dense,
mysterious world.</p><p>And if you are afraid of the dark, you will be afraid of love too. If
you are afraid of the night, you will be afraid of love too. If you are
afraid of the dark, the night, death, love, then you are afraid of all
that is mysterious -- then you have to exist only on the surface, then
you will never be able to penetrate to the center of being.</p><p>The original is:</p><p>IK PREM-RAS CHAKHA NAHIN, AMLI HUA TO KYA HUA?</p><p>You have not tasted the juice of love -- and you have become a great
saint? and you have great character and great morality? And you have not
even tasted the juice of love? Then all your saintliness and all your
morality is holy cow-dung. You are carrying an unnecessary weight. The
sooner you drop it the better.</p><p>THE YOGI COMES ALONG IN HIS FAMOUS ORANGE. BUT IF INSIDE HE IS
COLOURLESS THEN WHAT?</p><p>The real question is of getting coloured inside. The outer colour is
only symbolic. It is a gesture; it is not the end -- it is the
beginning. It is simply your saying that I am ready."</p><p>But don't think that if you are wearing orange then sannyas has
happened. Your gesture has happened, you have moved on the way.</p><p>There are two initiations. One is the formal: the day you become a
sannyasin, you change to orange -- that is formal. But without the
formal, the informal is difficult. If you cannot even change your
clothes, how will you change your being? But just changing your clothes
is not synonymous with changing your being.</p><p>Kabir says:</p><p>THE YOGI COMES ALONG IN HIS FAMOUS ORANGE.</p><p>BUT IF INSIDE HE IS COLOURLESS, THEN WHAT? VAKIF NAHIN US RANG SE</p><p>KAPARE RANGE SE KYA HUA?</p><p>You have not known the colour of God, you have not know the colour of
love, you have not known the colour of life. Orange is the colour of
blood, life; orange is the colour of fire, love; orange is the colour of
the sunrise, the transforma-tion</p><p>-- the declaration that the night has ended.</p><p>But the being has to be coloured. Your soul has to become red with
love, with joy, with celebration. In India, orange is the colour of
spring -- a springtime has to come into your inner being so that flowers
that have waited and waited for centuries can bloom, so that buds can
open.</p><p>Kabir says:</p><p>EVERY INSTANT THAT THE SUN IS RISEN,</p><p>IF I STAND IN THE TEMPLE, OR ON A BALCONY, IN THE HOT FIELDS, OR IN A
WALLED GARDEN, MY OWN LORD IS MAKING LOVE WITH ME.</p><p>Meditate over this tremendously important statement:</p><p>... MY OWN LORD IS MAKING LOVE WITH ME.</p><p>THE MAN OF ABSOLUTE CONSCIOUSNESS remains in a constant orgasmic
state.</p><p>Just as two lovers reach an orgasmic climax only for a moment and
then it is gone, and a sadness comes in the wake, so the man of total
awareness, the Buddha, the enlightened person, remains for twenty-four
hours a day in an orgasmic state:</p><p>... MY OWN LORD IS MAKING LOVE WITH ME.</p><p>And wherever I am, Kabir says, it makes no difference -- in the
temple or in the</p><p>mosque or in the fields or in a walled garden -- it doesn't matter
where I am. Wherever I am, my Lord, my Beloved, is making love with
me.</p><p>Love is the quintessence of religion. And to be orgasmic is to be a
sannyasin -- and to become so orgasmic that it continues day in, day
out; even when you are asleep, the meeting continues. You go on melting
and merging into God, and God goes on melting and merging into you.</p><p>The wall between you and the whole has been removed, there is no
separation. That state of non-separation, that state of UNIO MYSTICA --
the mystic union -</p><p>- is the ultimate expression of love. The lowest is the man/woman
relationship and the ultimate, the highest, is the meeting of the
meditator with the whole.</p><p>Hence I say the journey is from sex to superconsciousness. Sex is the
beginning of the journey -- don't reject it. If you reject the
beginning, you will never reach the end. But remember that it is only
the beginning; don't get stuck there. You have to go farther and farther
ahead; you have to transcend it. And as you go higher in meditation, the
less and less sexual you are bound to become.</p><p>This is happening every day to my sannyasins. The whole country
thinks that here nothing but sex is happening, but the reality is just
the opposite. This may be the only place where thousands of people are
totally losing interest in sex -- because going through it is going
beyond it. To go beyond one has to go through, because without knowing
it there is no way to transcend it.</p><p>The sexual orgasm reveals two secrets to you: one is that in the
climax, at the peak, the ego disappears; and the second, time
disappears. And these are the two secrets of meditation. One day
meditating you will come to know that sex is not needed at all because
the ego and time can disappear without going into sex at all.</p><p>Sex is a natural way of meditation; it is a gift of nature, to keep
reminding you that this is possible. Mind, time, ego, all can disappear;
if they can disappear for a single moment, then why not for ever? Sex is
a natural window into God, but only a window. You need not remain
confined behind it. You can jump out of the window and you can come into
the open, in the sun, under the sky. But the window made it possible for
you.</p><p>Because sex helps you to know a few moments of egolessness,
timelessness, mindlessness, it makes it possible that you can long for,
desire a permanent state,</p><p>an eternal state of orgasmic joy -- satchitanand.</p><p>Kabir is absolutely right. Nobody else has said it so clearly: My own
Lord is making love with me, and every moment of the day, irrespective
of where I am, of what I am doing.</p><p>This has to become the experience of each of my sannyasins.</p><p>This is my message to you. You have to actualize this potential in
you. One day you have to be able to declare to the world: "The Lord is
making love with me twenty-four hours a day. I am in an orgasmic state.
Not only am I in an orgasmic state, but I am the orgasmic state."</p><p>That's what enlightenment is all about. Once it is achieved, nobody
can fall from it. Once it is achieved, all is achieved.</p><p>The Fish in the Sea is Not Thirsty Chapter #11</p><p>Chapter title: The Paradox that Life is. 21 April 1979 am in Buddha
Hall Archive</p><p>code: 7904210</p><p>ShortTitle: FISH11</p><p>Audio: Yes Video: No Length:</p><p>110</p><p>mins</p><p>The first question Question 1</p><p>OSHO, PLEASE COMMENT ON THE ART OF BALANCED LIVING. MR LIFE IS</p><p>OFTEN AN EXPERIENCE OF EXTREMES, WITH THE MIDDLE ROAD DIFFICULT TO
MAINTAIN FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME.</p><p>Gregg Johnson,</p><p>LIFE CONSISTS OF EXTREMES. Life is a tension between the opposites.
To be exactly in the middle for ever means to be dead. The middle is
only a theoretical possibility; only once in a while are you in the
middle, as a passing phase. It is like walking on a tightrope: you can
never be exactly in the middle for any length of time. If you try, you
will fall.</p><p>To be in the middle is not a static state, it is a dynamic
phenomenon. Balance is not a noun, it is a verb; it is BALANCING. The
tightrope-walker continuously moves from the left to the right, from the
right to the left. When he feels now he has moved too much to the left
and there is fear of falling, he immediately balances himself by moving
to the opposite, to the right. Passing from the left to the right, yes,
there is a moment when he is in the middle. And again when he has moved
too much to the right, there is fear of falling, he is losing balance,
he starts moving towards the left. Passing from the right to the left,
again he moves through the middle for a moment.</p><p>This is what I mean when I say balance is not a noun but a verb -- it
is balancing, it is a dynamic process. You cannot be in the middle. You
can go on moving from left to right and right to left; this is the only
way to remain in the middle.</p><p>Don't avoid extremes, and don't choose any one extreme. Remain
available to both the polarities -- that is the art, the secret of
balancing. Yes, sometimes be utterly happy, and sometimes be utterly sad
-- both have their own beauties.</p><p>Our mind is a chooser; that's why the problem arises. Remain
choiceless. And whatsoever happens and wherever you are, right or left,
in the middle or not in the middle, enjoy the moment in its totality.
While happy, dance, sing, play music -- be happy! And when sadness
comes, which is bound to come, which is coming, which has to come, which
is inevitable, you cannot avoid it... if you try to avoid it you will
have to destroy the very possibility of happiness. The day cannot be
without the night, and the summer cannot be without the winter, and life
cannot be without death.</p><p>Let this polarity sink deep in your being -- there is no way to avoid
it. The only way is to become more and more dead. Only the dead person
can be in a static middle. The alive person will be constantly moving --
from anger to compassion, from compassion to anger. And he accepts both!
And he is not identified with either. He remains aloof and yet involved.
He remains distant yet committed. He enjoys and yet he remains like a
lotus flower in water -- in water, and yet the water cannot touch
it.</p><p>Gregg Johnson, your very effort to be in the middle, and to be in the
middle for ever and always, is creating an unnecessary anxiety for you.
In fact, to desire to be in the middle for ever is another extreme, the
worst kind of extreme, because it is the impossible kind.</p><p>It cannot be fulfilled.</p><p>Just think of an old clock: if you hold the pendulum exactly in the
middle, the clock will stop. The clock continues only because the
pendulum goes on moving from the left to the right, from the right to
the left. Yes, each time it passes through the middle, and there is a
moment of that middleness, but only a moment. And it is beautiful! When
you pass from happiness to sadness, and from sadness to happiness, there
is a moment of utter silence exactly in the middle -- enjoy that
too.</p><p>Life has to be lived in all its dimensions, only then is life rich.
The leftist is poor, the rightist is poor, and the middlist is dead! The
alive person is neither rightist nor leftist nor middlist -- he is a
constant movement, he is a flow.</p><p>Why do we want to be in the middle in the first place? We are afraid
of the dark side of life; we don't want to be sad, we don't want to be
in a state of agony. But that is possible only if you are also ready to
drop the possibility of being in</p><p>ecstasy. There are a few who have chosen it -- that is the way of the
monk. For centuries that has been the way of the monk. He is ready to
sacrifice all possibilities of ecstasy just to avoid agony. He is ready
to destroy all roseflowers just to avoid the thorns. But then his life
is just flat... a long long boredom, stale, stagnant. He does not really
live. He is afraid to live!</p><p>Life contains both: it brings great pain, it also brings great
pleasure. Pain and pleasure are two sides of the same coin. If you leave
one, you have to leave the other too. This has been one of the most
fundamental misunderstandings down the ages, that you can leave pain and
save pleasure, that you can avoid hell and have heaven, that you can
avoid the negative and can have only the positive. This is a great
fallacy. It is not possible in the very nature of things. The positive
and negative ARE together, inevitably together, indivisibly together.
They are two aspects of the same energy.</p><p>My sannyasins, or those who understand me, have to accept both. I am
giving you a totally new insight: Be all! And when you are on the left,
don't miss anything -- enjoy!</p><p>Being on the left has its own beauty; you will not find it when you
are on the right. It will be a different scene. And, yes, to be in the
middle has its own silence, peace, and you will not find it on any
extreme. So enjoy all! Go on enriching your life.</p><p>Can't you see any beauty in sadness? Meditate over it. Next time when
you are sad don't fight with it, don't waste time in fighting. Accept
it, welcome it -- let it be a welcome guest. And see deep into it, with
love, care. Be a real host! And you will be surprised --</p><p>you will be surprised beyond your comprehension -- that sadness has a
few beauties which happiness can never have. Sadness has depth, and
happiness is always shallow.</p><p>Sadness has tears, and tears go deeper than any laughter can ever go.
And sadness has a silence of its own, a melody, which happiness can
never have. It will have its own song, more noisy, but not so
silent.</p><p>I am not saying choose sadness: I am just saying enjoy it too. And
when you are happy, enjoy happiness. Swim on the surface too, and
sometimes dive deep into the river. It is the same river! On the surface
the play of ripples and waves, and</p><p>the sunrays and the wind -- it has its own beauty. And diving deep
into the water has its own quality, its own adventure, its own
danger.</p><p>And don't become attached to anything. There are people who have
become attached to sadness too -- psychology knows about them. They are
called masochists: they go on creating situations in which they can
remain miserable for ever. Misery is the only thing that they enjoy,
they are afraid of happiness. In misery they are at home.</p><p>Many masochists become religious, because religion provides a great
protection for the masochist mind. Religion gives a beautiful
rationalization for being a masochist. Just being a masochist without
being religious, you will feel condemned and you will feel ill -</p><p>- ill-at-ease -- and you will know that you are abnormal, and you
will feel guilty about what you are doing to your life. You will hide
the fact.</p><p>But if a masochist becomes religious he can exhibit his masochism
with great pride, because now it is no more masochism -- it is
asceticism, it is austerity -- tapascharya -- it is self-discipline, not
torture. Just the labels have been changed! Now nobody can call him
abnormal -- he is a saint. Nobody can call him pathological -- he is
pious, holy.</p><p>Masochists have always moved towards religion. Religion has a great
attraction for masochists. In fact, so many masochists down the ages
have moved towards religion -- it was very natural, that movement --
that religion became dominated by the masochists.</p><p>That's why religion goes on insisting on being life-negative,
life-destructive. It is not for life, it is not for love, it is not for
joy. It goes on insisting that life is misery. By calling life misery,
it rationalizes its own clinging to misery.</p><p>I have heard a beautiful story -- I don't know how far it is correct,
I cannot vouch for it: In paradise, one afternoon, in the most famous
cafe, Lao Tzu, Confucius and Buddha are sitting, and talking sweet
nothings.</p><p>The bearer comes and in a tray brings three glasses of the juice
called life and offers them. Buddha immediately closes his eyes and he
says, "Life is misery."</p><p>Confucius closes his eyes half-way -- the middlist, he used to preach
the golden</p><p>mean --</p><p>and asks the bearer to give him the glass because he would like to
have a sip, just a sip, because without tasting how can one say whether
life is misery or not? He had a scientific mind. Confucius was not very
mystic; he was a very pragmatic, earthbound mind. He was the first
behaviourist the world has known, very logical.</p><p>And it looks perfectly right: he says, "First I will have a sip and
then I will say."</p><p>He takes a sip and he says, "Buddha is right -- life is misery." Lao
Tzu takes all the three glasses and he says, "Unless one drinks totally
how can one say anything?"</p><p>He drinks all the three glasses and starts dancing! Buddha and
Confucius ask him, "Are you not going to say anything?" He says, "This
is what I am saying -- my dance, my song."</p><p>Unless you taste totally, you cannot say. And when you taste totally,
you cannot say because what you know is so much that no word is
adequate.</p><p>Buddha is on one extreme, Confucius is in the middle, Lao Tzu has
drunk all the three glasses. The one that was brought for Buddha he has
drunk, and the one that was brought for Confucius he has drunk, and the
one that was brought for him he has drunk -- he has lived life in its
three-dimensionality.</p><p>My own approach is that of Lao Tzu.</p><p>Gregg Johnson, live life in all possible ways; don't choose one thing
against the other, and don't try to be in the middle. And don't try to
balance yourself -- balance is not something that can be cultivated by
you. Balance is something that comes out of the experience of all the
dimensions of life. Balance is something that HAPPENS; it is not
something that can be BROUGHT. If you bring it it will be false, forced;
and if you bring it you will remain tense, you will not be relaxed,
because how can a man who is trying to remain balanced, in the middle,
be relaxed? He will always be afraid: if he relaxes he may start moving
towards the left or towards the right -- he is bound to remain
uptight.</p><p>And to be uptight is to miss the whole opportunity, the whole
God-given gift.</p><p>Don't be uptight. Don't live life according to principles. Live life
in its totality, drink life in its totality! Yes, sometimes it tastes
bitter -- so what? That taste of bitterness will make you capable of
tasting its sweetness. You will be able to appreciate the sweetness only
if you have tasted its bitterness. The man who knows not how to cry will
not know how to laugh either. And the man who cannot have a deep
laughter, a belly-laughter, his tears will be crocodile tears -- they
cannot be true, they cannot be authentic.</p><p>I don't teach you the middle way: I teach you the total way. And then
a balance comes of its own accord. And then that balance has tremendous
beauty and grace</p><p>-- you have not forced it, it has Come. By moVing gracefully to the
left, to the right, in the middle, slowly slowly, a balance COMES to
you, because you remain so unidentified. When sadness comes you know it
will pass, and when happiness comes you know it will pass too. Nothing
remains. Everything passes by.</p><p>The only thing that always abides is your witnessing. That witnessing
brings balance.</p><p>That witnessing is balance. The second question Question 2</p><p>OSHO, HOW CAN ONE DEVELOP A CONSCIENCE -- SOMETHING WITHIN</p><p>THAT WILL GUIDE ONE IN ONE'S EVERYDAY LIFE TOWARDS WHAT IS</p><p>NECESSARY FOR ONE'S DEVELOPMENT? TO DO WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR</p><p>THE UNFOLDING OF ONE'S INNER LIFE? IT SEEMS AS IF I AM ALWAYS
TORN</p><p>AND YET THERE DOES EXIST SOMETHING WITHIN AT TIMES WHICH I HOPE</p><p>COULD BE HELPED TO GROW AND BECOME A LIGHT FOR ME. CARL</p><p>ONE</p><p>LEARN TO INTENSIFY ONE'S FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS IN ORDER TO</p><p>BRING ONE CLOSER TO A PLACE OF REAL BEING?</p><p>Steven,</p><p>THERE IS NO NEED TO DEVELOP a conscience at all. What is needed is
consciousness, not conscience. Conscience is a pseudo thing. Conscience
is created in you by the society. It is a subtle method of slavery. The
society teaches you what is right and what is wrong. And it starts
teaching the child before the child is aware, before the child can
decide on his own what is right and what is wrong, before the child is
even conscious of what is happening to him, before the child is even
awake. In a kind of sleep, in a kind of dream, the child lives in the
beginning.</p><p>In the mother's womb the child sleeps for twenty-four hours. Then
after the birth he sleeps for twenty-three hours, twenty-two hours,
twenty-one hours, twenty hours... slowly slowly. But he remains in a
kind of limbo, neither awake nor asleep. The child cannot make any
distinction between what is real and what is unreal. And we start
teaching the child what is right, what is wrong -- we are conditioning
him. We are conditioning him according to our ideas. All these ideas --
from parents, from priests, teachers, politicians, saints -- -all these
ideas jumble together inside him. They become his conscience.</p><p>And because of this conscience he will never be able to grow
consciousness -- because conscience is a pseudo consciousness. And if
you are satisfied with the pseudo you will never even think of the real.
It is very deceptive; the way we have been bringing up children is very
deceptive. It is ugly, it is violent, it is against humanity.</p><p>That's why millions of people live without any consciousness. Before
they could have grown into consciousness, we gave them pseudo toys to
play with. And their whole lives they think this is all that is needed
to live a good life. And their whole lives they will be rewarded if they
follow the conscience, and they will be punished if they don't follow
the conscience.</p><p>From the outside they will be punished and rewarded, and from the
inside also.</p><p>Whenever you do something that your conscience says is wrong, you
feel guilty, you suffer, you feel inner pain. You are afraid, you are
trembling... it creates anxiety. And the fear about heaven, that you may
lose heaven, and the fear of hell, that you may fall into hell... and
with great inventiveness your saints have painted the joys of heaven and
the miseries of hell.</p><p>This is conscience. Conscience is artificial, arbitrary. Conscience
is needed because the society does not want you to be intelligent.
Hence, rather than making you intelligent it gives you fixed rules of
behaviour: Do this, don't do that.</p><p>The day humanity drops this whole nonsense of conscience and starts
helping children to grow their consciousness will be the greatest day,
will be the real birth of humanity, a new human being and a new earth.
Then we will help the child to become more intelligent, so whenever a
problem arises the child has enough intelligence to encounter it, to
face it, to respond to it. Why should one need any conscience?
Intelligence is enough, consciousness is enough.</p><p>Consciousness will make you capable of responding to the present
immediately, and your response will be true. Conscience is old, and the
situation is always new -- and your conscience is ALWAYS old. There is
no meeting-ground. You go on responding according to the conscience
cultivated in you by the society, forced into you by the society,
conditioned in you by the society -- and the situation is totally
different!</p><p>One of my friends went to Tibet. He is a very religious brahmin, very
orthodox. He went there to study Buddhist scriptures, but he could not
stay in Tibet -- he had to come back as quickly as possible. The journey
was simply a sheer wastage, an unnecessary trouble, because to go into
Tibet is not easy.</p><p>And the problem was that from his very childhood he had been taught
to take a cold bath before the sun rises. Now. to take a cold bath in
Tibet before the sun rises... he was telling me that it was impossible.
And if he did not take the cold bath before sunrise, the whole day he
would feel guilty. He had been told that without taking a cold bath in
the morning you cannot pray, your prayer is useless. And without prayer
you cannot eat anything. So he was taking a cold bath in the morning,
and that was dangerous to life. In Tibetan scriptures it is said that
once a year it is a must that one should take a bath!</p><p>Once a few Tibetan lamas came to stay with me, and those were the
days when Maneesha was not there and Radha was not there to smell these
people -- and I suffered so much...</p><p>For those few, seven, eight days that they stayed in my house, I was
almost out of the house. Any excuse and I would escape from the house --
the whole house was stinking, because they would not take a bath. And a
hot summer in India... and they would not take any bath! They were
following their conscience.</p><p>It has been such a difficult thing for me to talk to Jaina monks.
They used to come to see me; it was so difficult to talk with them --
because they don't cleanse their mouths, rinse their mouths, they don't
clean their teeth. That is not allowed. That is thought to be a part of
beautifying the body -- -and how can a Jaina monk beautify the body? He
is so dead set against it.</p><p>Just to talk to them is so difficult -- they have such bad breath. It
is bound to be so. And the Jaina monks are not allowed to take a bath
either, because why should you be so careful about your body? -- the
anti-body attitude. Their bodies stink, their mouths stink.</p><p>One Jaina nun became so much impressed by me and be-came so much
interested in me that I told her, "You can at least take a sponge bath
-- nobody will know. Just a wet towel, you can... and nobody will ever
know that you have taken the bath."</p><p>The idea appealed to her. She took one sponge bath, felt very good
and very bad too. She told me, "It feels very good and I feel fresh, but
it hurts inside that I have committed a sin.</p><p>Do you ever think when you take a bath that you have committed a sin?
And she had not even taken a full bath -- just a sponge bath, just a wet
towel rubbed all over the body. But she felt so guilty that she had to
fast for three days as repentance.</p><p>This is conscience. Conscience goes on making you a fool. Situations
change, but the conscience cannot change, it cannot grow -- conscience
remains static. You go on living with ideas that were given to you in
your childhood, by your ignorant parents, ignorant teachers. And you
will live according to them, and you will suffer much. And your response
will never be true because it will never fit with the situation. You
will always be lagging behind.</p><p>Responsibility simply means the capacity to respond to the reality as
it is -- and it changes, the reality changes, and the conscience remains
fixed. That's the difference between conscience and consciousness.</p><p>Consciousness is a mirror. Conscience is a photoplate. Once a
photoplate is exposed, it is finished; it catches the picture and then
that picture remains for ever, fixed. It cannot grow, remember.</p><p>One woman was showing her child the family album, and they came
across a picture of a beautiful man with black hair, very fresh, young.
And the child asked, "Who is this, Mom?" And the mother said, "Don't you
recognize him? He is your father!" And the child said, "He is my father?
Then who is that bald- headed man who lives with us?"</p><p>In reality, things change. Beautiful black hair disappears -- one
becomes bald- headed.</p><p>But in pictures things are fixed.</p><p>Conscience is a photoplate and consciousness is a mirror. It also
reflects, but it never clings to any reflection. It remains empty, and
hence it remains capable of reflecting new situations. If it is morning,
it reflects the morning. If it is evening, it reflects the evening.</p><p>The photoplate is fixed; if you exposed it in the morning then it
will always remain morning in the photo, it will never become evening,
night.</p><p>There is no need, Steven, to develop a conscience. The need is to
drop the conscience and develop consciousness. Drop all that you have
been taught by others, and start living on your own and searching and
seeking.… Yes, in the beginning it will be difficult because you won't
have any map. The map is contained by the conscience. You will have to
move without the map, you will have to move into the uncharted, with no
guidelines. Cowards cannot move without guidelines; cowards cannot move
without maps. And when you move with maps and guidelines, you are not
really entering into new territory, into new realms -- you are going in
circles. You go on moving into the known; you never take a jump into the
unknown. It is only courage that can drop conscience.</p><p>Conscience means all the knowledge that you have. And consciousness
means being empty, being utterly empty, and moving into life with that
emptiness,</p><p>seeing through that emptiness and acting out of that emptiness --
then action has tremendous grace. And then whatsoever you do is right.
It is not a question of what is right and what is wrong, because
something that is right today may be wrong tomorrow. And borrowed
knowledge never helps.</p><p>Homer and Jethro were digging a ditch in the blazing Mississippi sun.
Seeing the boss sitting coolly in the shade above them, Homer put down
his shovel and said, "How come he is up there and we are down here?"</p><p>"I dunno," said Jethro.</p><p>Homer went up to the boss and asked him, "How come you boss up here
and we work down there?"</p><p>The boss answered, "Because I am smart." "What is smart?" asked
Homer.</p><p>"Here," said the boss putting his hand on a tree, "I will show you.
Try to hit my hand."</p><p>Homer wound up a mighty swing and let fly. Just as he swung, the boss
moved his hand away, and Homer crashed into the tree.</p><p>"Owwww!!!" he screamed.</p><p>The boss said coolly, "Now you are smart too."</p><p>Homer went back to the ditch. Jethro asked what happened and Homer
said, "Now I am smart."</p><p>Jethro said, "What is smart?" Homer said, "I will show you."</p><p>He looked around for a tree, and not seeing one, he put his hand over
his own face.</p><p>"Here," he said, "try to hit my hand "</p><p>That's what goes on with your so-called knowledge, conscience --
situations</p><p>change, trees are no more found... but you have a fixed routine and
you cannot do anything else, you go on repeating your routine. And life
has no obligation to fit with your routine. You have to fit with
life.</p><p>A VERY STRANGE, mysterious thing happened just twenty years ago in
the world of modern physics. It destroyed the whole Aristotelian logic;
it destroyed all ancient certainties. Physicists came to know that
electrons move in a very strange way: they behave simultaneously as if
they are particles and also as if they are waves. This is impossible!
Either something can be a particle or it can be a wave. In the language
of geometry, either something can be a point, a dot, or a line. but one
thing cannot be both together: a point, a dot, and a line together. That
is impossible. But that's what was happening.</p><p>They observed and observed, and the behaviour was such that the
electrons were behaving in a very illogical way. They tried hard to
figure it out, to somehow manage the old Aristotelian logic, that A is A
and A is never not A. That was the two-thousand-year-old thought,
deep-rooted, that A can never not be A. And that's what was happening:
the particle was behaving like a wave -- A was behaving not like A. Now
what to do?</p><p>It was difficult to discard Aristotle, very difficult -- a two
thousand years' long love affair.</p><p>But electrons have no obligation, they don't bother at all about
Aristotle. They were saying "Get lost!" And finally the physicists had
to agree with the electrons. And when they were asked again and again
"How is it possible?" they said, "What can we do? It is not a question
of possible or not possible -- it is happening! It is so! We understand
that it is illogical, that it should not be so, but what can we do? We
are helpless! The electrons don't believe in Aristotle."</p><p>Aristotle has been discarded -- the two-thousand-year-old tradition
of logic has become simply irrelevant.</p><p>Another phenomenon happened after a few years: they came to know that
when the electron moves from point A to B, in the middle it disappears.
Moving from point A to B, you find it on the point A, then suddenly you
find it on point B, but in the middle you don't find it at all.</p><p>Now this is even more impossible. Somebody coming from Bombay to
Poona; you find him in Bombay, and then you find him in Poona, and on
the way</p><p>nowhere is he found!</p><p>This is strange, unbelievable, but what to do? That's how it is. So
another great ancient idea simply had to be dropped. The old idea was
that nothing can come out of nothing.</p><p>Now that is happening: in the middle it is nothing, in the beginning
it is something, in the end it is again something. So out of something
nothing comes, and out of nothing something comes again.</p><p>But this has been the experience of the mystics always. This is new
for modern physics, but this is not new for metaphysics -- this is very
ancient. Mystics have never believed in Aristotle; they have always been
anti-Aristotle -- they have always been illogical, because they don't
know what the way of the electron is but they know their own inner
consciousness. And there too they have observed these miracles: that the
ego is something, comes out of nothing, and then disappears into nothing
again. The ego arises out of nothing, becomes very solid, and then one
day in meditation you simply find it has evaporated again.</p><p>This has been one of the most ancient experiences about the ego: that
one moment it is there, another moment it is not there, and again it is
there. And this has been the experience about time too, that when you
are in deep meditation time simply disappears and when you come out of
meditation time is again there.</p><p>The mystics have known it, that life follows no logic, that life is
basically supra- logical, that life follows no reason, that
fundamentally it is irrational. Conscience is very arbitrary,
artificial. It gives you a fixed pattern, a fixed gestalt, and life goes
on changing, and life is very uncertain, it id very zig-zag. Unless you
are conscious you will not be able to live your life truly; your life
will be only a pretension, a pseudo-phenomenon.</p><p>You will always be missing the train.</p><p>And always missing the train is what creates anguish in man. Just
think of yourself always missing the train: rushing to the station, and
whenever you reach the train is leaving the platform. That's what
happens to the person who lives according to the conscience: he never
catches the train. He cannot! He has a fixed gestalt, and life is a
fluid phenomenon. He has a rocklike thing inside him and life is more
like water.</p><p>Be conscious. Don't ask how to grow, how to develop a conscience.
Here we are trying to do just the opposite: destroying conscience -- the
Christian conscience, the Hindu conscience, the Mohammedan conscience,
the Jaina conscience -- we are destroying all kinds of conscience. And
consciences come in all shapes and all sizes.</p><p>Consciousness is neither Christian nor Hindu nor Mohammedan -- it is
simply consciousness. Conscience divides people, consciousness
unites.</p><p>Steven, forget all about conscience. You ask:</p><p>HOW CAN ONE DEVELOP A CONSCIENCE -- SOMETHING WITHIN THAT WILL</p><p>GUIDE ONE IN ONE'S EVERYDAY LIFE...?</p><p>What is the need of carrying a guide with you? Consciousness is
enough! Whenever a certain need arises, your consciousness will respond.
You have a mirror, you will reflect it. And the answer will be
spontaneous.</p><p>When I was a student at university, my professors were very much
worried about me.</p><p>They were worried -- they loved me -- they were worried because I
never prepared for the examinations. They were even worried that I might
answer in such a way that the examiner may not even be able to see the
point.</p><p>My old professor, Dr. S. K. Saxena, he used to come just early in the
morning to wake me up so that I could study a little bit. And he would
sit in my room saying, "You do a little preparation." And he would leave
me in the examination hall, then he would go home, because he was even
worried that I may not go.</p><p>And when it came to the final oral examination, he was very very
worried, because I might say something that could offend the examiner.
He was also present; he was the head of the department so he was present
and the examiner was present. And he had told me, warned me again and
again, "Simply stick to the question! Whatsoever he asks, you simply
answer that. Don't go into any depth about it -- just a plain answer,
the answer that is given in the books will do. And I will be there and
if I see that you are going astray, I will just give you a push with my
foot underneath the table -- so then come back again and just stick</p><p>to the question."</p><p>The first question and the problem arose. The professor who had come
to examine asked,</p><p>"What is the difference between Indian philosophy and Western
philosophy?" And my professor became afraid, because he knew that the
words 'Indian' and 'Western' were enough for me... and that was so. I
said, "What do you mean by Indian? Can philosophy be Indian and Western
also? Then philosophy can be Bengali and Maharashtran. If science is not
Indian and Western, then why should philosophy be?"</p><p>And my professor started hitting me, and I told my professor, "Don't
hit me! You just keep yourself away. This is between me and him. You are
not supposed to give me any hints.</p><p>Now the old examiner was at a loss: what to do? Whatsoever he asked,
I answered him by another question. He was at a loss because he was just
carrying ready-made answers. I told him, "You look at a loss because you
can't respond. Now, it is such a simple thing that philosophy is
philosophy -- what has it to do with East and West? Say yes or
no...!"</p><p>But the fixed gestalt: Indian philosophy -- everything has to be
Indian, everything has to be Western, everything has to be this and
that... adjectives and adjectives. We can't think of this earth as one.
We can't think of humanity as one. Now, what is Indian about Buddha? and
what is Jewish about Jesus? Nothing at all. I have tasted both and the
taste is the same. But borrowed knowledge always remains in you as a
fixed thing, and whenever you respond out of your fixed ideas. your
response falls short. It is not a true answer to the reality.</p><p>So, Steven, there is no need to develop a conscience to guide you --
there is no need to have any guide! All that is needed is intelligence,
awareness, consciousness, so that you can respond whatsoever the case
is. Life brings challenges, you bring consciousness to those challenges.
And meditation is a way of dropping conscience and moving into
consciousness.</p><p>The miracle is: if you can drop conscience, consciousness arises on
its own -- because consciousness is a natural phenomenon. You are born
with it; just the conscience has become a hard crust around it and is
not allowing its flow. Conscience has become the rock and the small
spring of consciousness is</p><p>blocked by the rock. Remove the rock and the spring starts flowing.
And with that spring your life starts moving in a totally different way
that you have not even imagined before, you could not have even dreamt.
And everything starts to fall in harmony with existence. And to be in
harmony with existence is to be right -- not to be in harmony with
existence is wrong.</p><p>So conscience as such is the root cause of ALL wrong, because it
doesn't allow you to fall in harmony with existence. And consciousness
is always right just as conscience is always wrong.</p><p>And you ask: CAN ONE LEARN TO INTENSIFY ONE'S FEELINGS AND</p><p>EMOTIONS IN ORDER TO BRING ONE CLOSER TO A PLACE OF REAL BEING?</p><p>Neither thoughts will help to bring you closer to your being nor
feelings -- but feelings are better than thoughts, closer, but not yet
the real thing. First one has to drop thoughts, then one has to drop
feelings, so that the inner world becomes totally empty. In that
emptiness your consciousness turns upon yourself and the reality is
known.</p><p>Truth is neither a thought nor a feeling nor an emotion. Truth is the
experience of consciousness of itself. Soren Kierkegaard is right when
he says: "Truth is subjectivity."</p><p>Meditate and go on dropping... there are layers and layers and
layers. Man is like an onion -- go on peeling. Meditation is the art of
peeling the onion. And of course, when you peel the onion, tears come to
the eyes -- that has to be accepted. It is painful. Go on peeling the
onion till nothing is left in your hand -- that nothing is reality.</p><p>You can call it God, you can call it nirvana, enlightenment, or
whatsoever you want to call it. Names don't matter. But the real thing
happens only when NOTHING has happened.</p><p>The third question Question 3</p><p>OSHO, I ALWAYS DREAM OF SEX AND SEX AND SEX -- WHY?</p><p>Ram Das,</p><p>ARE YOU A FOLLOWER of Morarji Desai? Something is basically wrong
with you.</p><p>Your dreams simply show that you are living a repressed life. Your
dreams reflect how you are living your life. Your dreams are not just
dreams -- they are reflections.</p><p>In the waking time you must be repressing sex; then, naturally, it is
bound to assert itself in your dreams. Dreams only indicate that you are
doing something wrong with your life.</p><p>When your life is really harmonious, lived consciously, dreams
disappear -- all kinds of dreams disappear. Your whole sleep becomes
dreamless. That is the indication that the transformation is happening
-- that happens to every meditator. As meditation goes deeper, dreams
start disappearing.</p><p>But dreams show something about you. And you have to rethink, you
have to rearrange your life. If you are dreaming only of sex, that
simply shows you are sex-obsessed. And who is sex-obsessed? Whoever
represses is bound to be obsessed by it. Your dreams cannot just be
rejected as dreams -- as people do. They think they are just dreams,
nothing to be worried about. Your dreams are symbolic. Your unconscious
is trying to convey a certain message to you, that you are doing
something wrong.</p><p>Ram Das, sex is part of life. You cannot deny it -- you can transcend
it, but you cannot deny it. If you deny it, you will create unnecessary
complexities -- it will become an obsession. And it will create
perversions in your life.</p><p>Morarji Desai drinks his own urine -- not for no reason. It is a
perversion. It is rooted in sexual repression. Sexual repression can
take many kinds of perverted forms.</p><p>Trying to fall asleep, a Greek shepherd is counting sheep: "One, two,
three, four, five, hello darling "</p><p>Antonio: "Last night I had a night-a mare Angelo: "What-a
happened?"</p><p>Antonio: "I dreamt-a I was eating a-spaghetti Angelo: "Why is that so
bad?"</p><p>Antonio: "I woke up and a-the string on a-my pyjamas was a-gone."</p><p>Now Italians go on and on with spaghetti, spaghetti, spaghetti.
Dreams will reflect, dreams are reflections. If sex is reflected in your
dreams, reconsider your life. Drop all the old nonsense. You must be a
typical Indian, Ram Das. That's what goes on in the Indian mind
continuously. Even your saints are full of obsessive sex, because all
ways to transcend sex have been denied them.</p><p>You will be surprised to know that all kinds of sexual perversions
were invented by monks and nuns. And these are the people who condemn.
But psychologists say that homosexuality was invented by the monks and
the nuns -- homosexuality is a religious phenomenon. And so are other
things...</p><p>If you repress something, nature is going to take revenge on you And
remember, you cannot fight with nature. You can Will nature, not by
fighting with it but by being with it.</p><p>You can persuade nature to be with you and help you. And nature is
very compassionate.</p><p>But once you start fighting, you are bound to lose. Nature is vast
and you are very tiny. It is like a wave fighting with the ocean, a
small leaf fighting with the whole tree -- it is stupid! The wave can
win, but not against the ocean -- with the ocean.</p><p>And that's my basic teaching.</p><p>Sex can be transcended and should be transcended, but transcendence
has to be not against nature but with nature, Through nature. Accept
your sexuality -- it is part of you!</p><p>and a tremendously important part. You are born out of sex. Each cell
of your body is a sex cell. Sex energy is your life energy! -- respect
it, it is a gift from God. Understand it.</p><p>Be more and more meditative about it. But drop all prejudices, drop
all</p><p>condemnations.</p><p>because when you carry a condemnation you cannot understand a thing.
Drop all judgements. Sex is sex -- it is a pure natural energy. With
great acceptance, love, respect, meditate over it. Go deeper and deeper
into it to see what exactly it is. And in that very seeing you will be
going beyond it.</p><p>The day one has known what sex energy really is, one has transcended.
Sex disappears, but it disappears not by denying. But by understanding.
And the disappearance is not really the destruction of the energy but a
transformation. In existence nothing is ever destroyed, things are only
transformed.</p><p>It is sex when it is transformed that becomes love. And it is love
when it is transformed that becomes prayer. And it is prayer in its
ultimate transformation that becomes God.</p><p>The fourth question Question 4</p><p>OSHO, I DON'T ACCEPT YOUR CRITICISM OF SIGMUND FREUD. DO YOU</p><p>ACCEPT A SANNYASIN WHO SOMETIMES SAYS NO TO WHAT YOU SAY? I AM NOT
LESS NEUROTIC THAN FREUD, BUT I THINK THAT I CAN BECOME</p><p>CREATIVE ONLY IF I LEARN TO ACCEPT THE NEUROTIC PART OF MYSELF.</p><p>WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THIS?</p><p>Wolfgang,</p><p>WHO HAS CRITICIZED SIGMUND FREUD? I was simply stating a few facts!
To state a fact is not a criticism. If I call a blind man a blind man, I
may be rude but I am not criticizing. I may be blunt, I may not be
polite, but I am not criticizing.</p><p>Freud was neurotic, and there are a thousand and one facts supporting
this. Just</p><p>look into Freud's biographies and you will come across those facts
yourself. He was a homosexual.</p><p>He wrote such stupid homosexual letters to a man that later on he
asked the man again and again to destroy those letters, because when he
became famous he was afraid that some day or other those letters would
come to public notice.</p><p>The major part of those letters was destroyed, but a few somehow
survived. His whole life he was condemning homosexuality, and he had
deep homosexual tendencies.</p><p>It happens almost always that whatsoever you condemn in others is
really your inner problem. The other is just a scapegoat.</p><p>You say: I AM NOT LESS NEUROTIC THAN FREUD, BUT I THINK THAT I
CAN</p><p>BECOME CREATIVE ONLY IF I LEARN TO ACCEPT THE NEUROTIC PART OF</p><p>MYSELF.</p><p>That is true. That's what I teach here: accept it! Freud never
accepted his neurotic part. He not only never accepted it: he tried to
deny it, he tried to cover it up.</p><p>Once Freud and Jung were travelling in a train, and they started
talking about psychoanalysis. Suddenly Jung had a great idea -- he said,
"You have psychoanalysed so many people, but you yourself are not
psychoanalysed. It will be good if you also go through psychoanalysis.
Somebody whom you have psychoanalysed and whose psychoanalysis is
complete can psychoanalyse you!"</p><p>And Freud became so afraid -- even just the idea -- that he started
trembling and he fainted. When he came back he said, "I cannot allow
that -- I cannot allow myself to be psychoanalysed. That will expose
me."</p><p>And Jung said, "Then you are already exposed."</p><p>Freud never accepted that he had any psychological problems. He tried
to deny them, because the fear was that if you have psychological
problems, how can</p><p>you be the founder of psychoanalysis? He tried to prove that he was
superhuman</p><p>-- and he was not a Buddha, he was not an enlightened person. He
suffered from the same jealousies, paranoia, as everybody -- in fact
more than the ordinary, average person.</p><p>All his old colleagues left him by and by, and the reason was: he was
so jealous -</p><p>-</p><p>anybody who was reaching closer to him, becoming famous, known, he
would feel so jealous, so afraid, that a competitor was born, that he
would start attacking him. He did that to Adler, to Jung, and to many
others. ANYBODY, his OWN disciples -- he was afraid of his own
disciples, that they would become competitors or they may prove
themselves more important than he was. He could not conceive anybody
being more important in the world of psychoanalysis.</p><p>This is a very poor kind of mind, a very ordinary, mediocre mind. And
he was so political that the whole movement of psychoanalysis was
continuously in a turmoil. Conspiracies were going on for and against --
for this, against that. He was making his followers fight with each
other, because that is the only way: divide and rule. He was putting one
follower against another. He was running psychoanalysis as a political
thing.</p><p>I am not criticizing him. I have a great respect for the man -- in
spite of all his faults he made a great breakthrough. In spite of all
his human limitations he started a new dimension in human consciousness.
He IS the founder of psychoanalysis, and Jung, Adler and others, nobody
comes close to him; he was unnecessarily afraid. He was simply suffering
from paranoia: nobody comes close to him! He was a giant among
pygmies.</p><p>But the giant was afraid of the pygmies. He was not aware of his own
strength -- he was not aware at all; that is the problem.</p><p>Wolfgang, I am not against Freud. And you ask me:</p><p>DO YOU ACCEPT A SANNYASIN WHO SOMETIMES SAYS NO TO WHAT YOU</p><p>SAY?</p><p>Yes, that's what I teach. When your consciousness says no, say no.
When your consciousness says yes, say yes. I don't create a conscience
in you. I am not creating followers here -- no, not at all -- but
friends. Your no is as much respected as your yes.</p><p>That's the only way to show respect towards you You may not respect
yourself, you may have a self-condemnatory attitude, but for me you are
all potential Buddhas. How can I disrespect a Buddha? -- even though the
Buddha is potential, even though you are in the seed. But I can see the
flower!</p><p>In Kirlian photography they have discovered one thing which is very
significant: with very sensitive photoplates pictures can be taken of a
bud, but the picture will show not the bud but the flower that is going
to happen -- because before the bud opens, the energy field around the
bud opens. Just a few hours before the bud really opens, its energy
field opens. and Kirlian photography takes the photograph of the energy
field. The bud has not opened yet, the bud is still a bud, but Kirlian
photography can give you a picture of the future. It is not future for
the sensitive plate -- for the sensitive plate it is already
present.</p><p>Through Kirlian photography, illnesses can be caught before they
happen to you. To be precise: a few illnesses have been caught six
months before they happened</p><p>-- there was no possibility to even suspect that the man was going to
fall ill after six months from a certain illness -- there is no way to
know about it. Nothing has happened yet in the body, but something has
happened in the energy field that surrounds the body. And Kirlian
photography can take the photograph of the energy field and can infer
through the photograph that this man is going to have cancer after six
months. Now Kirlian photography is going to become a tremendously
powerful instrument in the hands of the future medicine. If we can know
six months before, then much can be done -- then nobody need fall ill.
The illness can be prevented even before it has happened.</p><p>And that's how I see you. Before my eyes you are not buds but
flowers, before my eyes you are not seeds but fully grown trees -- great
foliage, flowers, fruits. Before me you are Buddhas! Hence I call you
'friends'. Kabir calls his disciples: Friends, wake up!</p><p>You are accepted, Wolfgang, with all your nos, with all your yeses --
you are accepted as you are. I don't make any condition. If you are
ready to become a sannyasin, who am I to prevent you? The chance has to
be given to you to grow,</p><p>to be.</p><p>The last question Question 5</p><p>OSHO, WHY IS THE NEW GENERATION SUCH A PROBLEM TO THE PARENTS?</p><p>Narayana,</p><p>BECAUSE THE NEW GENERATION IS MORE INTELLIGENT. Intelligence</p><p>brings problems. And it is natural that the new generation should be
more intelligent. That's how evolution happens. Each new generation is
going to be more intelligent than the preceding one. Your children will
be more intelligent than you, and your children's children will be more
intelligent than your children.</p><p>It is a momentum, a gathering momentum. You are standing on the
shoulders of the Buddhas -- the whole part is yours. For example, in my
being Buddha is a part,Jesus is a part, Abraham is a part, Krishna is a
part, Mohammed is a part... in that way Buddha was poorer than me, Jesus
was poorer than me. And some future enlightened person will be richer
than me, because I will be part of his being but he cannot be part of my
being.</p><p>Evolution goes on gathering momentum.</p><p>Each child should be more intelligent than the parents -- but that
brings trouble, because that is what offends the parents. Parents would
like to pretend that they are all-knowing.</p><p>In the past it was easy to pretend because there was no other way to
impart knowledge to the children than by the oral communication from the
parents.</p><p>For example, a carpenter's son would learn all that he would ever
learn through the father.</p><p>The father would not only be the father but the teacher also. And the
son would always be in awe and respect of him, because the father knew
so much -- he knew everything about all kinds of trees and wood and this
and that, and the son</p><p>knew nothing. He would have tremendous respect.</p><p>Age used to be respected: the older a man was in the ancient days,
the more wise, of course, because of his experiences. But now we have
invented better means of communication. The father is no more the
teacher; now the teaching profession is a totally different profession.
The child goes to the school. The father had gone to the school thirty
or forty years before. In these thirty, forty years there has happened a
knowledge explosion. The child will learn something which the father is
not aware of, and when the child comes home, how can he feel any awe? --
because he knows more than the father, he is more up to date than the
father. The father seems to be out-moded.</p><p>This is the problem, and this is going to be so more and more,
because our expectations are old and we still want the child to respect
the parents as he used to respect them in the past -- but the whole
situation has changed. You will have to learn something new now: start
respecting the child. Now, the new has to be respected more than the
old. Start learning from the child because he knows better than you.
When your son comes from the university, he certainly knows better than
you.</p><p>That has been my experience at university. One of my philosophy
professors used to talk such nonsense, and the reason was that he had
been to university thirty years before. In those days, when he was a
student, Hegel and Bradley, they were the most important figures in the
world of philosophy. Now nobody cares about Hegel and Bradley. Now
Wittgenstein and G. E. Moore have taken their place.</p><p>This professor had no idea of Wittgenstein, no idea of G.E. Moore. He
was so outmoded that I had to tell him. "You are so old, so useless,
that either you start reading what is happening now in philosophy or you
stop teaching!"</p><p>Naturally, he was angry -- I was expelled from the university. He
wrote a letter to the vice chancellor and said, "Either I am going to
teach or this student is to remain in the university. but we cannot both
remain together -- he is trouble."</p><p>He was not ready to read Wittgenstein. In fact, I can understand his
problem: even if he had read he would not have understood. Wittgenstein
is a totally different world from Hegel. And he used to talk about Hume
and Berkeley... which are rotten names, no more of any significance --
part of history, part of</p><p>footnotes.</p><p>This is the problem. You ask me, Narayana:</p><p>WHY IS THE NEW GENERATION SUCH A PROBLEM TO THE PARENTS?</p><p>They are not really a problem: your expectation that they should
respect you, that they should respect you as children have always
respected their parents -- it is impossible. You start respecting them.
You start respecting the new. Age in itself cannot now be any reason for
respect. Intelligence, consciousness, they should be respected. And if
you respect your children, they will respect you. But only if you
respect your children will they respect you. The old way was that you go
on humiliating the children, you go on insulting them in every possible
way, and they have to respect you -- now this cannot be so any more.</p><p>The preacher's wife, while shopping, noticed a sign in the butcher's
shop: "Dam Ham on Sale." Slightly taken aback by such a name, she
confronted the butcher about the use of profanity, but was reassured
when he explained that this was a new breed of hogs being raised up by
Hoover Dam, hence the name 'Dam Ham'. She decided to take some home and
fix it for her family that evening.</p><p>When her husband arrived home, she was cooking and he asked, "What's
for dinner? '</p><p>"Dam ham," she replied.</p><p>The minister, who had never heard such language in his house, began
to reproach her, but after she explained he felt a little embarrassed
for doubting his wife.</p><p>That evening as they sat down to dinner with their six-year-old son,
the minister said grace and then asked, "Pass the dam ham, please."</p><p>The little kid looked up, his eyes got big, and he said, "Now you are

THE EGO CANNOT BE SACRIFICED because the ego</p><p>exists not.</p><p>The ego is just all idea: it has no substance in it. It is not
something -- it is just pure nothing. You give it reality by believing
in it. You can withdraw belief and the reality disappears,
evaporates.</p><p>The ego is a kind of absence. Because you don't know yourself, hence
the ego. The moment you know yourself, no ego is found. The ego is like
darkness; darkness has no positive existence of its own; it ii simply
the absence of light. You cannot fight with darkness, or can you? You
cannot throw darkness out of the room; you cannot take it out, you
cannot take it in. You cannot do anything with darkness directly. If you
want to do anything with darkness, you will have to do something with
light. If you put the light on, there is no darkness; if you put the
light off, there is darkness.</p><p>Darkness is only the absence of light -- so is ego: absence of
self-knowledge. You cannot sacrifice it.</p><p>It has been told to you again and again: "Sacrifice your ego" -- and
the statement is patently absurd, because something that does not exist
cannot be sacrificed. And if you try to sacrifice it, something which is
not there in the first place at all, you will be creating a new ego --
the ego of the humble, the ego of the egoless, the ego of the person who
thinks he has sacrificed his ego. It will be a new kind of darkness
again.</p><p>No, I don't say to you: Sacrifice the ego. On the contrary, I say:
Try to see where the ego is. Look DEEP into it; try to locate it, where
it exists, whether it exists at all or not.</p><p>Before one can sacrifice anything one must be certain about its
existence.</p><p>But don't be against it from the very beginning. If you are against
it, you cannot look deep into it. There is no need to be against
anything. The ego is your experience -- maybe it is just apparent, but
it is still your experience. Your whole life moves around the phenomenon
of the ego. It may be a dream.</p><p>But to you it is so true.</p><p>There is no need to be against it. Dive deep into it, go into it.
Going into it means bringing awareness into your house, bringing light
into darkness. Be alert, watchful.</p><p>Watch the ways of the ego, how it functions, how it manages at all.
And you will be surprised: the deeper you go into it, the less it is
found. And when you have penetrated to the very core of your being, you
will find something totally different which is not ego, which is
egolessness. It is self, supreme self -- it is</p><p>God. You have disappeared as a separate entity; you are no more an
island, now you are part of the whole.</p><p>In that experience of being one with the whole, the ego IS
sacrificed, but that is only a way of speaking, a metaphor. Don't take
it literally.</p><p>Try to understand the ego. Analyse it, dissect it, watch it, observe
it, from as many angles as possible. And don't be in a hurry to
sacrifice it, otherwise the greatest egoist is born: the person who
thinks he is humble, the person who thinks that he has no ego.</p><p>That is again the same story played on a more subtle level. That's
what the religious people have been doing down the ages: pious egoists
they have been. They have made their ego even more decorated; it has
taken the colour of religion and holiness. Your ego is better than the
ego of a saint; your ego is better, far better -- because your ego is
very gross, and the gross ego can be understood and dropped more easily
than the subtle. The subtle ego goes on playing such games that it is
very difficult. One will need absolute awareness to watch it.</p><p>The ego of the sinner is more easily dropped than the ego of the
saint. And the saint can always manage to pretend. And his ego is so
polished, so decorated, so holy, so sanctified by tradition, by
convention, by the crowd, that he may almost forget about it.</p><p>The real search is not to make your ego humble; that is ego standing
upside- down, ego doing SHIRSHASAN -- headstand. Avoid it. Rather,
follow a totally different path: meditate on the phenomenon of ego,
enquire what it is. And as the enquiry deepens, the ego disappears.
Enquiring into the ego you will come to the self.</p><p>And remember: the self has nothing to do with the ego, because the
self has nothing to do with you at all. The self is always the supreme
self: AHAM BRAHMASMI! -- I am God!</p><p>At that point, you are not, only God is: Tat-tvam-asi -- thou art
that. At that point, there is no distinction between thou and that. The
dewdrop has disappeared into the ocean and has become the ocean
itself.</p><p>But no sacrifice -- the non-substantial cannot be sacrificed, it can
only be</p><p>understood.</p><p>And in the very understanding is the disappearing. And this
disappearance is beautiful, because it does not leave any traces behind,
no scars, no wounds.</p><p>The second question Question 2</p><p>OSHO, WHAT IS RATIONALIZATION? I AM ASKING THIS QUESTION</p><p>BECAUSE MY HUSBAND IS A PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY AND</p><p>WHATSOEVER I SAY HE ALMOST ALWAYS SAYS IT IS NOTHING BUT A
RATIONALIZATION.</p><p>Malti,</p><p>RATIONALIZATION IS A TRICK OF THE MIND to deceive not only others but
yourself too. Your husband may be practising rationalization himself.
Whenever he says to you, "This is a rationalization," it may be nothing
but a rationalization on his part. He wants to avoid, he wants to
escape; he does not want to answer directly. He condemns you.</p><p>And of course he uses a big, very big word: rationalization. And
naturally the wife is cowed down -- there must be something wrong. And
the husband knows, and he is a professor of philosophy, so he is bound
to know. He is practising rationalization himself.</p><p>Rationalization is not true reasoning; it is a strategy, a
pretension. It pretends to be rational but it is not.</p><p>"Why do you drink?" asked Hogan.</p><p>"Booze killed me mother," answered Kehoe, "and booze killed me father
-- I am drinking for revenge!"</p><p>This is a rationalization. If you want to drink, drink! But this is a
very subtle way of deceiving yourself and others.</p><p>From a diary of an Italian girl on a Caribbean cruise:</p><p>Monday -- was invited to dine at the Captain's table. Tuesday --
spent the day with the Captain.</p><p>Wednesday -- Captain made ungentlemanly proposals to me.</p><p>Thursday -- Captain said he would sink the ship if I did not agree to
his proposals.</p><p>Friday -- saved five hundred lives.</p><p>This is rationalization. Man is very cunning; man's cunningness is
unlimited. And people go on doing things in the name of reason.</p><p>Today Acharya Vinoba Bhave is going to start his fast unto death --
because he wants a total ban on cow slaughter. He calls it his religious
duty. How can this be a religious duty? This is blackmail; this is
threatening the country. And from where has he got the idea? He says
that his mother appeared in his dream and told him, "This is the work
that you have to do."</p><p>Now, for his dream, and a mother of the dream, he is threatening the
country: "I will commit suicide if you don't listen to me." But rather
than saying it directly, "I will commit suicide," he says he will fast
unto death.</p><p>And these people are thought to be saintly, and these people are
thought to be great preachers of non-violence. That's exactly what his
master, Mahatma Gandhi, did his whole life; now he is perpetuating the
rotten tradition. For these thirty years at least, India has suffered
from these people -- and there seems to be no end to it.</p><p>This is called non-violence. If I threaten somebody that "I will kill
you if you don't listen to me," I will be caught by the police. I will
be a criminal against the law. But if I threaten that "I will kill
myself if you don't listen to me," this is thought to be some holy
act.</p><p>This is strange that nobody says, "These people should immediately be
caught and brought into the court -- because they are threatening
suicide, and it is a crime against the law." Any attempt to commit
suicide is a crime against the law.</p><p>But Vinoba Bhave is a saint.</p><p>Morarji Desai went to see him to persuade him: "Don't do it!" because
he himself has been doing it, the same thing. That's how he bas come in
power: by threatening to commit suicide.</p><p>These are subtle ways of coercion, violence. Who is one single person
to decide for the whole country? Then somebody can say, "I will fast
unto death unless everybody stops smoking -- because my mother appeared
in the dream and she said, 'Son, this great work you have to do.'"</p><p>Coercion becomes non-violence. A threat to commit suicide becomes a
beautiful thing when you call it 'fast unto death'! And rather than
being caught by the police and brought before the court, the prime
minister runs, the ministers are running and everybody is trying to
persuade him: "Don't go on your fast unto death." And nobody is saying
that this is a crime!</p><p>These are rationalizations. One can do anything if one has a cunning
and clever mind to rationalize it.</p><p>Malti, sometimes you may be rationalizing -- watch it. But my own
experience of women is that they are not great rationalizers -- men are
bigger rationalizers, because women live more intuitively, more
instinctively, and man lives more through the head, through reason.</p><p>Women don't bother much about logic. Their behaviour is more or less
illogical -</p><p>-</p><p>instinctive, spontaneous. They don't try to masquerade it in a
logical way; they simply jump from one point to another without
bothering about the Aristotelian process of logic.</p><p>They simply jump! Their leaps are quantum, from one point to another.
You cannot see what the bridge is, how they manage to get from one point
to another. Their ways are totally different from men's.</p><p>Malti, more possibility is that your husband is rationalizing, that
this is his way of putting you down. He uses philosophical jargon:
rationalization. And, of course, you become afraid -- you have done
something wrong. I can't think, Malti, that you can do much of a
rationalization; women don't indulge in it. But</p><p>it is better to understand, because to be with a husband who is a
professor of philosophy it is better to understand what rationalization
is. And now, next time, whatsoever your husband says, you simply
say,</p><p>"This is a rationalization,' and watch what happens.</p><p>Just the other day I was reading about a psychiatrist who was mending
his car, and his boy was playing with a little girl from the
neighbourhood on the balcony on the first story. And down below he was
tinkering with his car.</p><p>Suddenly the boy pushed the girl from the balcony and she fell down
on the ground. The father was, of course, angry. He looked up and before
he could say anything, the boy asked, "Dad, can you tell me why I did
it? You are supposed to be the psychoanalyst, psychiatrist -- tell me
why I did it."</p><p>Next time your husband says anything, don't be worried about it --
just say, "This is a rationalization." He is using a big word; a few
people are obsessed with big words. But rationalization is a subtle
process; people indulge in it -- men more. I have rarely come across a
woman who indulges in rationalization; except the lib women nobody
indulges in rationalization. They are following all the way the
footsteps of men.</p><p>But it is good to understand what it is, and if you indulge in it, it
is better not to indulge in it. It is a camouflage. It is better to be
authentic, true, rather than hiding yourself behind smoke screens.</p><p>Now, it will be good if Vinoba Bhave simply says, "I want to impose
my will on this country," that will be simple. "I am ready to die if my
will is not accepted." But that he will not say, "I want to impose my
will on this country," because then he will be exposed:</p><p>"Who are you to impose your will? This is a democracy. You cannot
impose your will.</p><p>You have a single vote -- a single vote equal to everybody else's
vote. Nobody's vote is more valuable, so who are you?"</p><p>But this is how this goes on.…</p><p>Morarji Desai wants to impose prohibition on the country. Who are you
to</p><p>impose such things? Then where is freedom and where is democracy?
Yes, if you are against alcohol, teach, express yourself, argue,
persuade... that's what democracy means. Persuade people!</p><p>If you are against cow slaughter, go around and persuade people not
to eat cow meat. But threatening that you will commit suicide is very
totalitarian dictatorial, undemocratic. It is a crime against the
people, against the law, against democracy.</p><p>But you can hide the fact in religious terminology, you can go on
doing something with a mask. And people wear masks: rationalization is
one of the ways of wearing masks.</p><p>Be true. Be authentic. There is no need to be untrue, because the
more untrue you become, the farther and farther you will be from
God.</p><p>I am not worried about your husband -- I am worried about your being
farther and farther away from God. If you indulge in strategies like
rationalization, you will never come closer to your own inner self where
God resides. Drop all false faces so that you can find your original
face. And to find the original face is the greatest blessing and the
greatest benediction in life.</p><p>The third question Question 3</p><p>OSHO, WHEN THIS QUESTION ARISES -- WHO AM I? -- I GET VERY
AFRAID.</p><p>IS THERE SOMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT IT?</p><p>Prem Dada,</p><p>THIS QUESTION MAKES EVERYBODY AFRAID. It is nothing exceptional; it
is absolutely the case with everybody. Whoever wants to go deep into the
question, into the quest, of "Who am I?" is bound to feel fear at a
certain point. Why? Because there comes a point where you cross the
boundary of the ego and enter into the world of egolessness.</p><p>That point is the point of great fear -- because it looks like death.
And, in fact, it</p><p>is a kind of death: the ego disappears.</p><p>And up to now that has been your identity. Up to now that's what you
have been thinking you are. And suddenly it starts evaporating. A great
fear grips the heart: "I am dying!"</p><p>because your identity is dying. You are not really dying; in fact,
you are being born. It is a rebirth, it is a true birth.</p><p>It is like the seed dying into the soil. The seed must be feeling
afraid, nervous, trembling.</p><p>How can the seed trust that once he is gone there will be a great
tree and great flowering?</p><p>The seed will not be there to witness it; no seed has ever witnessed
it, so how can this seed believe and trust?</p><p>And the same happens with the ego: the ego cannot trust that there is
anything more than itself And the ego is dying, and the ego starts
breathing its last, and you become afraid.</p><p>Many people turn back from that point, rush back out.</p><p>This is going to happen to every meditator. Hence, Dada, your
question is significant, very significant. Every meditator has to
encounter this situation, this challenge. ManY</p><p>times people come to the point from where they would have entered
into God, but they could not risk, they could not gather courage. They
became afraid, scared; they rushed out.</p><p>You have to take the risk. And I tell you, from my own experience, it
is not death. Yes, it is a death to the ego, but the death of the ego is
the birth of the soul. You will die as a drop, but you will be born as
the ocean. It is worth it. You will be dying only as a limited being, as
a defined being, and you will be born as undefined, undefinable.</p><p>Yes, you will disappear, with all your neurosis, psychosis. with all
your tensions, anxieties, anguishes: you will disappear with all your
problems, worries; you</p><p>will disappear as you have known yourself up to now. But your
disappearance is only a change of garments, and you will be getting
closer to your reality, deeper into your reality. You will get more
rooted into being.</p><p>That's the whole search!</p><p>You ask me: WHEN THIS QUESTION ARISES -- WHO AM I? -- I GET VERY</p><p>AFRAID.</p><p>It is natural. It is a good sign that you are coming closer to the
boundary. You may be standing exactly on the boundary; that's why
whenever the question arises, immediately you become afraid. Feel
blessed that you are so close to the boundary from where a totally new
world and a totally new life can have a start. Just one single step...
and you will be a new man, and you will be an original man. Just a
single step, and all the garbage that the society has dumped on you will
have dropped, and you will be just a pure consciousness. You will have
wings! Now you are just crawling on the earth... and then you will be
able to soar high towards the sun.</p><p>To be with a Master simply means to learn trust, to learn the art of
risking, to learn the ways of adventuring into the unknown. Yes, the sea
is uncharted, and it is dangerous to leave the shore, but it is only the
people who leave the shore who taste something of immortality. It is
only the people who take the risk of going into danger who really live;
others only pass through life, but they really don't live. Others only
vegetate; others only move through empty gestures.</p><p>So now this is a very decisive moment for you. You can go back, you
can cling to your identity, or you can go ahead, not looking hack at
all. Be courageous! I can only say this much: that the same has happened
to me, the same fear -- it is human. I had also gone back and forth. To
cross this line is really difficult. But sooner or later, one decides
--</p><p>because going and coming back does not help. And once you have come
so close to the line, you cannot be satisfied with your ordinary life
any more. So you can go out, but there you will find everything has
become meaningless. Now you will be in a dilemma.</p><p>And this is the work of a Master: to create the dilemma. The without
becomes</p><p>meaningless, and the within seems to be dangerous. To live the
ordinary life again becomes impossible, and to take the jump into the
new also seems impossible. But sooner or later, one decides to take the
jump -- because what is the point of clinging to something that has
become meaningless, which has lost all significance! How long can you
cling to it?</p><p>The Master waits, the Master remains patient. He allows you to go
back and forth, he goes on watching that you are shunting in and out.
But he knows one thing: that every day the outer will go on losing its
significance more and more. One day it will be utterly useless, absurd,
to be there. And as the outer loses significance, the inner will become
more and more magnetic -- simultaneously the process happens.</p><p>And one day it becomes irresistible -- one has to cross the line. And
that day is the greatest day in a human being's life, when you drop your
old identity and enter into the unknown -- you have encountered God, you
have come home.</p><p>The fourth question Question 4</p><p>OSHO, I ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT AN AMERICAN, A CHINESE, AN AFRICAN, A
SWEDE, AN INDIAN, COULD BE HAPPY AND CONTENT AND</p><p>COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER DESPITE THEIR VARYING COLOURS, HABITS,
BELIEFS, ETCETERA, JUST AS LONG AS THEY WERE NATURAL AND</p><p>HONEST WITH THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER. WHY IS MANKIND MAKING</p><p>THIS IMPOSSIBLE FOR MANKIND?</p><p>Darius M. Mody,</p><p>IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE BELIEFS and still live in peace. The belief
is the root cause of all conflict. Only a world of agnostic seekers can
be one. Believers cannot allow the world to be one.</p><p>For example, the Christian believes that it is only through Christ
that salvation is possible</p><p>-- now, how is a Mohammedan going to tolerate it? The very idea is a
danger for him. He believes that only through Mohammed is true salvation
possible. And how can this be tolerated by the Buddhist who thinks that
except for Buddha there has never been another enlightened person?
Buddha and Mahavira lived together, they were contemporaries, but
Buddhists don't think that Mahavira is enlightened; neither do Jainas,
the followers of Mahavira, think that Buddha is enlightened. Now, how is
a Jaina going to believe that Jesus is enlightened? -- because he is not
a vegetarian, he is a non-vegetarian. How can a non-vegetarian become
enlightened? The belief of the Jaina is that one who becomes enlightened
is bound to be vegetarian. How can he kill? His belief is going to
become a barrier.</p><p>And ask the Christian -- he cannot believe in Mahavira because he
never helped the poor.</p><p>Just standing under a tree naked, meditating with closed eyes, looks
very selfish to the Christian. Mahavira should have opened at least a
few hospitals, schools; he never did anything. He did not do any
miracles either -- giving eyes to the blind, raising dead people back to
life. What kind of enlightened person is he? No miracle, no service to
humanity -- only talks about non-violence, but no compassion in his
acts, in deed. The Christian cannot believe that Buddha is enlightened.
What service has he done for humanity...?</p><p>Now, these differing beliefs divide people. Belief is the way of
division. Humanity can be one only when people drop beliefs. And that's
what I am trying to do here. Be an enquirer, don't be a believer.
Enquire into truth, but don't start with a prejudice -- don't start as a
Christian or a Mohammedan or a Hindu.</p><p>Darius, you say: I ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT AN AMERICAN, A CHINESE,
AN</p><p>AFRICAN, A SWEDE, AN ITALIAN, ALL COULD BE HAPPY AND CONTENT</p><p>AND COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER DESPITE THEIR VARYING COLOURS,
HABITS, BELIEFS, ETCETERA, JUST AS LONG AS THEY</p><p>WERE</p><p>NATURAL AND HONEST WITH THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER.</p><p>The American believes in the American way of life, and the Indian
believes in the Indian way of life -- the conflict is there. And the
Indian believes that India is the only holy country in the world, the
only religious country in the world. American. The very word smells of
materialism. To the Indian mind, the word 'American' means something
absolutely irreligious, unholy. The American represents to him the man
of indulgence.</p><p>And to the American the Indian symbolizes snobbery, hypocrisy,
egoism. How can these people meet? The American has to drop his being
American, and the Indian has to drop his being Indian. We have to start
thinking in terms of the whole earth. Religious beliefs, political
beliefs, beliefs of all kinds, divide people. And, hence, all beliefs
are dangerous, poisonous.</p><p>You can see here, Darius, people of all races, all countries, all
religions, meeting</p><p>-- with NO problem. And never is it being told to them: "Be tolerant
of others" -- because the very idea of being tolerant carries
intolerance in it. Why should it be told to somebody:</p><p>"Be tolerant of others"? It simply means that there is intolerance
and one has to learn to tolerate.</p><p>It is never told here to anybody that Hinduism and Christianity and
Islam all mean the same thing; to say so means that you are suspicious.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say that the Koran and the Gita and the
Dhammapada, they all mean the same thing. And with great effort he used
to try to find similarities -- why bother? The very effort shows that
there is suspicion. And the effort cannot succeed, because they are not
similar. The Koran has its own beauty and the Gita has its own beauty,
and they are not similar, not at all.</p><p>Trying to impose similarity on such unique, original scriptures is
really sickening. How can Mahavira and Krishna have the same message? It
is not. Just think if Arjuna had told Mahavira, "I want to renounce the
world and the war and I want to go to the forest" --</p><p>Mahavira would have immediately initiated him into renunciation. He
would have said,</p><p>"That's what you should have done. It is already late; but, still,
good. War is violence, and it is good that an insight is born in you --
renounce the world and go to the forest."</p><p>But Krishna persuaded him not to go to the forest: "Fight the war
because this is your duty. And your very being is such that you can only
be a warrior; your type is such.</p><p>Renunciation won't suit you, it won't fit you. You will be a misfit,
and even in the forest you will start hunting; you will not be able to
meditate, you will hunt. I know you well, I know you from your very
childhood. And all this nonsense that you are talking about is nothing
but a rationalization. You are not against war!" And he was not --
Krishna was right, his insight was deep -- he was not against war. He
was really against killing his own people.</p><p>The war was a family war between brothers, and on both the sides were
relatives.</p><p>Because the fight was between cousin-brothers, all the relatives had
to divide -- a few had gone to this side, a few to that side. One
brother was on this side, another brother was on that side. Even Krishna
himself had divided; his army was fighting on the other side and he
himself was fighting with Arjuna, because both were his friends and both
had asked his help. So he had said, "You can choose: one can take my
army and one can take me."</p><p>Arjuna's own teacher from whom he had learnt all that he knew about
war, who had made him a perfect warrior, Drona, he was on the other side
-- his own master, from whom he had learnt archery, he was fighting on
the other side. It was really a family war. And Arjuna was not against
war: he was against killing one's own people. Seeing the whole war-field
full of his own people -- a few on this side, a few on that side -- and
both would be killed and many would be killed -- he started thinking,
"What is the point of it all?</p><p>Killing my own family! It is better I should renounce."</p><p>He was not against violence. If his own people had not been involved,
he would have enjoyed the war like anything. Krishna persuaded him to
see the fact that he was rationalizing; all this nonsense talk about
non-violence, no war, peace, renunciation, was just a rationalization.
He forced him to see the trick of his mind.</p><p>Now, how can you say Mahavira and Krishna are saying the same thing?
They are not saying the same thing.</p><p>My own experience is this, that all those who have become enlightened
in the world --</p><p>and Moses is enlightened, and Zarathustra is enlightened, and Lao Tzu
is enlightened and Mohammed and Jesus and Krishna, Buddha, Mahavira,
Kabir, and many many more --</p><p>what they have experienced is the same. But still their personalities
are so different, their individuality is so unique, that their
expressions are utterly different and you cannot force by ally strategy
to make it appear that they are saying the same thing -- they are
not.</p><p>Their experience is the same, their ultimate experience is the same,
but their choice of how life should be lived, how that ultimate
experience should be approached, is totally different. Their paths are
different, their goal may be the same -- but the goal will be known only
when you have arrived, not before that. Before the goal you will have to
follow the path.</p><p>MAHATMA GANDHI WAS TRYING somehow to prove that the Mohammedan and
the Hindu and the Jaina are all saying the same thing. It was a forgery,
because he was choosing from the Koran only sentences which are
harmonious with the Gita, and not choosing sentences which are
disharmonious with the Gita. The Gita is his criterion. He calls the
Gita his mother, but he does not call the Koran his father. The Gita is
his mother; he remains a Hindu, basically a Hindu. And according to the
Gita he goes on finding...</p><p>wherever anything can be found which is similar, he chooses it, picks
it up; but anything that is not similar to the Gita, he simply drops it,
he forgets all about it.</p><p>This is not a right approach. And still he could not convince
anybody. In fact, the very effort was futile, an exercise in futility --
he could not convince the Mohammedans, he could not convince the Hindus.
Mohammedans remained Unconvinced; they continued demanding a separate
country, and they succeeded in having a separate country. And he could
not convince the Hindus -- in fact, one Hindu murdered him, one fanatic
Hindu murdered him. He could not convince anybody.</p><p>And I cannot believe that he convinced himself either. His whole life
he was singing in his ashram: "ALLAH-ISHWAR TERI nam -- Allah and
Ishwar, both are thy names!" But when he was shot dead, Allah didn't
come to his heart. When the bullet passed into his heart, he cried,
"Ram!" not Allah -- "Hey Ram!" That is very decisive. At that moment all
philo-sophizing was forgotten, the real Hindu surfaced. He could not
remember Allah at that moment, could not remember Buddha, could not
remember Mahavira. The person he remembered was Ram -- the Hindu ideal,
the Hindu incarnation of God. That shows that he could not even convince
himself -- what to say of others?</p><p>In this place I am not trying to convince anybody, and still things
are happening. I am not trying to bring a synthesis of all religions,
because I know it is utterly futile. They ARE</p><p>different, they are unique. And I respect their uniqueness. In fact,
the world is richer because there is a Koran and there is a Gita and
there is a Dhammapada. The world is richer because Zarathustra happened,
Lao Tzu happened, Buddha happened; the world is richer because there is
Nanak and Kabir and Farid. So many different flowers! The world is a
beautiful garden.</p><p>And the rose is not the lotus, and the lotus is not the rose -- both
are flowers, both have bloomed, that is true. Buddha has bloomed and
Jesus has bloomed -- both are flowers --</p><p>but a rose is a rose and a lotus is a lotus. And it is good that not
all are roses, that not all are lotuses.</p><p>But something very mysterious is happening here, Darius, you can see:
all kinds of people are here, from almost every country, from every
religion, and nobody teaches them to be tolerant and nobody teaches them
to be respectful of the other's religion.</p><p>These things are simply not talked about, and still nobody is
intolerant. In fact, nobody thinks in terms that the other is other.
This is a totally different vision.</p><p>My approach is that you have to drop -- not to imbibe tolerance, not
to imbibe a certain synthesis, manipulated, man-made -- you have to drop
this whole nonsense of the American way of life and the Indian way of
life and the Chinese way of life. You have to drop this whole nonsense
that "I am a Hindu, Mohammedan, Parsi, Sikh." You are just a human
being! Maybe your colour is</p><p>different -- so what? It is good that there are people of different
colours, different flowers. Your hair is different -- good! It makes
life more worth living, more interesting. The variety gives
richness.</p><p>Your idea, Darius, that people can live in harmony even though they
have different beliefs is wrong. Those different beliefs are the
problem. In fact, to believe is to go wrong: knowing is good, believing
is wrong. Enquiring is good, gathering prejudice is wrong. Be a seeker
and be an agnostic.</p><p>By 'agnostic' is meant: say clearly to others and to yourself that "I
don't know -- so how can I cling to any belief? I was born in a Hindu
family, so I have been taught the Hindu religion by my parents, but I
don't know what is right and what is wrong -- it is just incidental. Had
I been brought up by a Christian, I would have believed in the Christian
religion in the same way. Or, if I had been born in Soviet Russia then I
would have been a communist; then I would not have believed in the
trinity of God the Father and God the Son and the Holy Ghost. I would
have believed in a totally different trinity: Marx, Engels, Lenin, and
the Kremlin would have been my Kaaba, and DAS KAPITAL would have been my
Bhagavad Gita."</p><p>Just see -- it is simple! Nobody is born a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a
Christian</p><p>-- these things are imposed on you. This is ugly that these things
are imposed on you. In a really free world no religion will be imposed
on anybody. All religions will be available to everybody! One should be
free to shop around. One can go to the temple, to the mosque, to the
gurudwara, and one can move around, do a little religious shopping; one
can look into the Koran and the Bible and the Vedas, and decide on one's
own.</p><p>Parents should not decide the religion of their children. It should
be a crime against humanity to force any child into any religion. Yes,
parents should teach the child to enquire and how to enquire. They
should make available to him all alternatives, so if the child wants one
day to become a Mohammedan, you may be a Hindu but if your child wants
to become a Mohammedan, it is perfectly good. You should be happy your
child has chosen a religion. It is good that he is becoming religious.
How does it matter where he will pray? -- in the temple or in the
mosque. The only thing that matters is that he will pray.</p><p>But now, right now, that is not the case. Nobody is interested in
prayer: everybody is interested -- where? Nobody is interested in making
you really</p><p>religious; everybody is interested in making you a Christian,
Catholic, Protestant, this and that. This is an ugly situation -- and
that divides people.</p><p>We have to fight for a world where children will not be forced into
any religion. And every child should be given all opportunities to
choose. Who knows what is going to fit him? My own observation is that
it happens that a man is born in a Jaina family, but he is not that type
-- he is not the type of Mahavira. Then his whole life he will be doing
something for which he is not meant. He will follow Mahavira, but his
heart will not be in it. His heart can go far more deeply with Meera,
with Krishna -- but that is not possible, he is a Jaina. And vice versa:
a man may be born into a family which worships Krishna but seeing
Krishna no bells ring in his heart. Then what is he supposed to do?</p><p>Pretend? Be a hypocrite? Go on believing because his parents are
Hindus so he has to remain a Hindu? Seeing the statue of Mahavira naked,
silent, his heart may be stirred, he may feel a new fluttering in his
being, a new energy, a new flash of lightning. It may click! Then that
is his religion.</p><p>Religion has to be found by your own heart. All religions are good.
All religions are different. All religions are ways: They reach the same
goal. But nobody can follow all the ways. If you follow all the ways you
will go crazy. You have to follow one way, knowing perfectly well that
all the ways are leading to the same peak of the mountain. Still one has
to follow one way.</p><p>But if the beginning is not a belief but enquiry, the world will be
totally different. Darius, with beliefs it is not possible. Habits are
okay; habits are going to be different.</p><p>In the Indian atmosphere there will be different habits. But habits
are not a big problem; you can understand that in a cold country there
will be different habits than in a hot country. That is very natural.
But beliefs have nothing to do with cold or hot, beliefs have nothing to
do with climate. Beliefs have nothing to do with nature: beliefs are
man-made.</p><p>Beliefs are all basically political, tactics, strategy, to manipulate
the crowds, to control the crowds.</p><p>You ask: WHY IS MANKIND MAKING THIS IMPOSSIBLE FOR MANKIND?</p><p>BECAUSE MAN IS NOT YET BORN: mankind exists only in theory. Once a
man said to George Bernard Shaw. "What do you think of civilization?" He
said, "It is a good idea, but somebody has to try it."</p><p>Mankind is also a good idea -- but somebody has to try it. It has not
yet happened.</p><p>Humanity has not yet arrived. Hindus are there, Mohammedans are
there, Christians are there, Indians and Germans and Italians are there,
but humanity has not yet arrived. It is a simple word, but empty, with
no substance.</p><p>If somebody asks you, "Darius, who are you?" it is almost impossible
to conceive that you will say, "A human being." You will say, "A
Christian, a Hindu, a Parsi, a Mohammedan.…" You may say, "A doctor, an
engineer, a professor, a scientist..." so on and so forth, ad nauseam,
but almost impossible to comprehend, even to imagine that you will say,
"A human being."</p><p>And if you say it, the other person who is asking will feel that you
are a little crazy or something. "Yes, of course, you are a human being!
But I am asking: who are you?"</p><p>Humanity has yet to happen, and we have to prepare the ground for
humanity to happen.</p><p>It can happen only by dropping ALL kinds of beliefs. It can happen
only by creating a great upsurge of enquiry, creating an atmosphere, a
space, in which belief simply means that you are ignorant -- you don't
know, still you are trying to pretend that you know.</p><p>Belief is not knowing but a deception.</p><p>A real man does not believe. Either he knows or he does not know. If
somebody asks you, "Does God exist?" if you are honest, sincere, you
cannot say, "I believe in God, I believe that he exists." And you cannot
say, "I don't believe in God, and I say that he does not exist." No. If
you are a sincere man, if you have any respect for truth, you will say,
"I don't know. I am searching, seeking. I am neither a believer nor a
non-believer. I am a seeker, a searcher."</p><p>And the day you know, do you think you will believe then? Then there
will be no need to believe. You don't believe in the sun! You don't see
people fighting</p><p>that the sun exists, that the sun does not exist, that the sun rises
in the east or the sun rises in the west, south, north -- you don't see
people fighting. Everybody knows the sun rises in the east, and
everybody knows that the sun IS -- there IS no question of belief.</p><p>If you ask me, "Do you believe in God?" I will say, "No, because I
know God is. I need not believe." Knowing is the real thing; belief is
just a camouflage, a cover-up.</p><p>Help people to drop beliefs. Help people to become enquirers. Help
people to start functioning from not knowing. And that is the state of
meditation: to function from a state of not knowing is to function
meditatively. To function from the state of knowledge is to miss the
whole point. Knowledge is always old and life is never old. Knowledge
and life never meet.</p><p>Hence I am using the word 'knowing' deliberately, instead of
'knowledge'. 'Knowledge' is a noun, 'knowing' is a verb. Knowing is a
flow, knowledge is static. Knowledge has a full point, knowing has no
full point -- it is simply an ongoing process. One never knows God in
the sense of knowledge; one only knows God in the sense of knowing. Yes,
there is a beginning, but then there is no end. One goes on knowing more
and more and more, and the more one knows, the more one feels there is
more to knower.</p><p>You say, Darius: I ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT JUST AS LONG AS THEY WERE</p><p>NATURAL AND HONEST WITH THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER, THEY</p><p>COULD ALL BE HAPPY AND CONTENT AND COMMUNICATE WITH EACH</p><p>OTHER DESPITE THEIR VARYING COLOURS, HABITS, BELIEFS, ETCETERA.</p><p>But how can people be natural and honest when they are carrying so
many beliefs? To be natural means to be without any belief Children are
natural, but you are not natural.</p><p>Animals are natural, but you are not natural. Trees are natural, but
you are not</p><p>natural.</p><p>And what has made you unnatural and artificial? Your belief
system.</p><p>But it is very difficult to drop the belief system. And how can you
be honest if you believe? It is a contradiction in terms, to be honest
and to believe. If somebody says, "I believe in God," he is saying, "I
don't know -- I have heard, I have been taught, I have been told. I
believe in God; I don't know myself " How can he be honest? This is the
beginning of dishonesty. Not knowing himself, and still believing, what
more dishonesty can there be?</p><p>Parents teach their children, "Believe in God and be honest." This is
such a contradiction in terms: "Believe in God and be honest!" Only one
is possible: either you can believe in God, then you cannot be honest;
or you can be honest, then you have to say clearly and loudly, "I cannot
believe in God, because I don't know."</p><p>But this is a double bind that is being created in every person. You
are taught contradictory things -- hence your schizophrenic state. You
are taught such contradictory things that you remain split. And you have
been taught so long that you don't see the contradiction either. The
so-called religious person -- Christian, Mohammedan, Hindu --</p><p>he cannot be honest. If he is honest, he cannot be Christian, Hindu
or Mohammedan.</p><p>How can you be honest and still believe that Christ was born of a
virgin mother? Just tell me -- how can you be honest and still believe
it? How can you be honest? Deep down you know it is not possible.
Children are not born of virgin mothers.</p><p>How can you be honest and still believe that when a snake attacked
Mahavira, instead of blood, milk flowed from his foot? How can you
believe it -- and still be honest? There is only one possibility, that
in Mahavira's body instead of blood milk was circulating. But to keep
milk circulating for so long -- he must have been nearabout fifty when
this snake attacked him -- milk would have turned into curd long
before.</p><p>And curd cannot flow. Mahavira would have been dead long before. How
can you be honest and still believe in this? If you are honest,
questions will arise.</p><p>And if you believe, you have to be dishonest -- you have to repress
your questions.</p><p>Man can be natural and honest, but then beliefs have to be dropped --
all kinds of beliefs have to be dropped. And dropping the beliefs, your
energy is freed, and that same energy becomes enquiry, and that same
energy can take you to the ultimate truth.</p><p>People are so religious, so fanatically religious, that I have
heard:</p><p>"Is your grandfather a religious man?" asked the young coed of her
date.</p><p>"He is so Orthodox," replied the boy, " when he plays chess, he
doesn't use bishops -- he uses rabbis."</p><p>The last question Question 5</p><p>OSHO, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE STATEMENT THAT LIFE IS STRANGER
THAN FICTION?</p><p>Nandan,</p><p>IT CAN'T BE OTHERWISE, because fiction is only a reflection of life,
only an echo, a faraway echo. How can fiction be more strange than life?
It is just a shadow of life, footprints of life. Life is really
unbelievable, incredible. It should not be, and it is. It is utterly
mysterious.</p><p>But you become aware of the strangeness of a fictitious story and you
never become aware of the strangeness of life, because you take it for
granted. You take it for granted as the fish takes the ocean for granted
-- and it never becomes aware of it. How can the fish be aware of the
ocean? It was born in the ocean, it has lived in the ocean; from the
very beginning the ocean was there. Just as you are not aware of the air
and the weight of the air, you are not aware of the gravitation and the
pull of the gravitation, in the same way, the fish is not aware of the
ocean, and in the same way you are not aware of the incredible life that
surrounds you within and without -- you take it for granted, and that's
what makes you miserable.</p><p>Stop taking life for granted, and immediately you are constantly in
awe. Each moment becomes a surprise, each moment becomes such a
revelation of mystery, and life takes a totally different colour and
flavour. You grow wings. Then you are no more bored, then you are no
more dull. Then life is excitement, exhilaration, ecstasy.</p><p>And that's what, basically, true religion is: to make you aware of
the life, to make you alert to all that is happening around you -- the
sun, the moon, the stars, the rivers, the mountains, the people... this
silence this moment... your being here, my being here... what more
mystery can there be than this communion? Your hearts beating with my
heart, your life energy in rhythm with my life energy... for this single
moment, three thousand people in harmony, in such an utter silence, as
if there exists nobody... this melting, this merging... what more
mystery can there be? What more miracles?</p><p>Just to be is a miracle! Just to be able to breathe is a miracle!
Just to be able to see the light and the rainbow and the starry night --
what more can you ask for? What more can you imagine?</p><p>You ask me: OSHO, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE STATEMENT THAT</p><p>LIFE IS STRANGER THAN FICTION?</p><p>I don't think! -- it is. There is no need to think -- I know -- it
is, it is so. Thinking is a lower activity, seeing is a higher activity.
I see it is so -- it is not a logical conclusion for me, it is my
existential experience. I am constantly surprised -- each moment, every
breath is a surprise. And this is not a statement, this is the truth!
Just become a little more alert, a little more aware, a little more
observant. Snap your fingers and slap your face and be awake! And then
look around... and the silence, and the beauty and the benediction.</p><p>It is said that Hotei became enlightened and started laughing, and
then he never stopped laughing. For many years he lived, he laughed. He
laughed all the way to God, all the way to death. And people would ask,
"Hotei, why do you laugh?" because he became famous in Japan as the
laughing Buddha. And he would say, "Because life is incredible, so
ridiculous, so absurd." It should not be, but it is! For no reason at
all flowers go on blooming and birds go on singing, and every morning
the sun is back. For NO reason! If it doesn't turn up one day, what
can</p><p>we do? For no reason at all!</p><p>And all exists in such harmony, accord, in such rhythm, that if you
touch a grass leaf, you have touched the whole universe -- because the
small grass leaf contains the whole of the universe. It will not be
there without the sun, it will not be there without the earth, it will
not be there without the planets and the stars. It will not be there if
this universe is not exactly the way it is. And if that grass leaf is
gone, the universe will be a little less, a little minus; it will miss
it. Such an infinity, and it goes on with such rhythmic flow, with such
organic oneness, with such orgasmic joy.</p><p>Just watch life... and you will be able to laugh. It IS absurd, it IS
ridiculous, it IS strange, it is miraculous. No dream can be more
dreamlike than life, and no poetry can be more poetic than life -- and
no joke can create more laughter than life.</p><p>A couple of hillbillies from the backwoods country came into town to
get married and brought their best man, Zeke, along. When they applied
for a license, the clerk informed them that state law required blood
tests before they could get a license, and told them there was a doctor
around the corner who would make the tests.</p><p>As the M.D. took blood samples from the prospective bride and groom,
Zeke watched with great interest. "What are you doing, Doc?" he
asked.</p><p>"We check for venereal disease," said the physician. "If we find any,
the wedding can't take place until it is cured."</p><p>"Well then," said the best man, "ain't you gonna test my blood?"
"What for?" asked the doctor. "You are not getting married are you?"</p><p>"Oh, no," said Zeke, as he pointed to the couple, "but I am gonna
board with them!"</p><p>... You missed it...! You will need another.</p><p>Payne and Butler were washing their hands in a Pittsburgh men's room

Man is not one</p><p>single being: man is the past and the future. The past means the
animal, and the future means the divine. And between the two is the
present moment, between</p><p>the two is man's existence --</p><p>divided, torn apart, pulled in diametrically opposite directions.</p><p>If man looks backwards he is an animal. That's why science cannot
believe that man is anything more -- just another animal -- because
science only searches into the past.</p><p>Charles Darwin and others, they are right that man is born of the
animals. It is true about the past, but it is not true about man's
totality.</p><p>Religion looks into the possible, into that which can happen and has
not yet happened.</p><p>Science dissects the seed and cannot find any flowers there. Religion
is visionary, it dreams -- and is capable of seeing that which has not
happened yet: the flower. Of course, it cannot be found, that flower
cannot be found, by dissecting the seed. It needs great insight, not
capacity to analyse, but some intuitive flight, some vision, some poetic
approach. It needs a real dreamer who can see that which has not
happened yet.</p><p>Religion looks into the possible and finds man is not an animal, but
divine: man is God --</p><p>both are true. The conflict is baseless. The conflict between science
and religion is futile.</p><p>Their directions, their methods of work, their fields, are totally
different.</p><p>Science always reduces everything to the source, and religion always
takes a flight to the goal. Man is both, hence man is a dilemma, a
constant anxiety: to be or not to be, to be this or to be that?</p><p>Man can find peace only in two ways: either he becomes an animal
again -- then he will be one, then there will be no division, then again
there will be peace, silence, harmony.…</p><p>And that's why millions of people try to be animals in different
ways.</p><p>War gives a chance for man to become animal; hence war has great
attraction. In</p><p>three thousand years' history man has fought five thousand wars --
continuously, somewhere or other, the war continues. Not even a single
day passes when man is not killing other men.</p><p>Why such tremendous joy in destruction, in killing? The reason is
deep down in the psychology of man.</p><p>The moment you kill, suddenly you are one; you become the animal
again, the duality disappears. Hence, in murder, in suicide, there is a
tremendous magnetic force. Man cannot be persuaded yet to be
non-violent. Violence erupts. Names change, slogans change, but the
violence remains the same. It may be in the name of religion, in the
name of political ideology, or any absurd thing -- a football match is
enough for people to get violent, a cricket match is enough.</p><p>People are so much interested in violence that if they cannot do it
themselves -- because it is risky and they think of the consequences --
they find vicarious ways to be violent. In a movie, or on the TV,
violence is a must; without violence, nobody is going to see the film.
Seeing violence and blood, suddenly you are reminded of your animal
past; you forget your present, you completely forget your future -- you
become your past. You become identified; what is happening on the screen
somehow becomes your own life.</p><p>You are no more a spectator -- in those moments you become a
participant, you fall en rapport.</p><p>Violence has great attraction. Sexuality has great attraction,
because it is only in sexual moments that you can become one; otherwise
you remain two, divided, and the anxiety and the anguish persist.
Violence, sex, drugs, they all help you, at Least for the time being,
temporarily, to fall back, to become all animal. But this cannot become
a permanent state of affairs.</p><p>One fundamental law has to be understood: nothing can go backwards.
At the most you can pretend, at the most you can deceive, but nothing
can go backwards because time docs not move backwards. Time always goes
ahead. You cannot reduce a young man to a child, and you cannot reduce
an old man to a young man -- it is impossible. The tree cannot be
reduced back to the original seed -- it is impossible.</p><p>Evolution goes on and on and there is no way to prevent it or to
force it backwards.</p><p>Hence all efforts of men to become animals and find peace are doomed
to fail. You can be drunk through alcohol or through other drugs --
marijuana, LSD -- you can be completely drowned. For the moment all the
worries disappear, for the moment you are no more part of a problematic
existence, for the moment you move in a totally different dimension --
but for the moment only.</p><p>Tomorrow morning you will be back, and when you are back the world is
going to be more ugly than it ever was before, and life is going to be
more of a problem than it ever was before. Because while you were
intoxicated, unconscious, asleep in the drug, the problems were growing.
The problems were becoming more and more complicated.</p><p>While you were thinking that you had gone beyond the problems, the
problems were taking root more in your being, in your unconscious.</p><p>Tomorrow again you will be back in the same world -- it will look
more ugly compared to the peace that you had attained by reduction, by
intoxication, by forgetfulness.</p><p>Compared to that peace, the world will look even more dangerous, more
complex, more scary. And then the only way is: go on increasing the
doses of your drug. But that too does not help for long. And this is no
way to get out of the dilemma. The dilemma remains, persists.</p><p>The only way is to grow towards the divine, the only way is forwards.
The only way is to become that which is your potential -- the only way
is to transform the potential into the actual.</p><p>MAN IS POTENTIAL GOD, and unless he becomes actual God there is no
possibility of contentment. People have tried that too: How to become
divine? And becoming divine, what to do with the animal? The simplest
solution that has appeared again and again down the ages is: repress the
animal. It is the same solution; either repress the divine --</p><p>through violence, through sex, through drugs -- forget about the
divine. That is one solution -- which never succeeds, cannot succeed; in
the very nature of things it is bound to fail. Then the second
suggestion that comes to the mind is: repress the animal, forget the
animal; keep the animal at the back, don't look at it. Throw it deep
down in the basement of your unconscious so you don't come across it in
your daily life, so you don't see it.</p><p>Man thinks almost in the same way as the ostrich. The ostrich thinks
if he cannot see the enemy, the enemy does not exist. Hence, when the
ostrich encounters the enemy he simply closes his eyes. By closing his
eyes he thinks now there is no enemy because he cannot see him.</p><p>That's what has been done down the ages by ninety-nine percent of
religious people. In that one percent I leave Buddhas, Krishnas, Kabirs.
Ninety-nine percent of religious people have just been doing nothing but
an ostrich exercise -</p><p>- an exercise of utter futility.</p><p>Repress the animal! But you cannot repress the animal because the
animal has great energy. It has been your whole past; it is millions and
millions of years old. It has deep roots in you; you cannot so easily
get rid of it, just by closing your eyes. You are simply being
stupid.</p><p>And the animal is your base, it is your very foundation. You are born
as an animal; you are not different from any other animal. You CAN be
different but you are not -- just by being born you don't become
different. Yes, you have a different kind of body, but not very much
different. You have a different kind of intelligence, but not very much
different. The difference is only of quantity, not of quality.</p><p>Now modern research into plants says that even plants are
intelligent, sensitive, alert, aware -- what to say about animals? A few
researchers say that even metals have a kind of intelligence of their
own. So the difference between man and the elephant. between man and the
dolphin, between man and the monkeys, is not of quality, it is only of
quantity, only of degrees. We have a little bit more intelligence,
that's all.</p><p>It is not much of a difference, at least not a difference that makes
any difference. The qualitative change happens only when a man becomes
fully awakened, when a man becomes a Buddha -- then the real difference
happens. Then he is no more an animal.</p><p>Then he is simply divine -- but how to attain it?</p><p>That ninety-nine percent of religious people has been doing something
utterly wrong --</p><p>just the same logic. The same logic that is being followed by the
violent people,</p><p>the sexual people, the alcoholics. The same kind of logic: forget the
animal. Many techniques have been developed to forget the animal: chant
mantras so that you can forget the animal, become occupied in chanting;
go on repeating "Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama."</p><p>Repeat it so fast that your whole mind be-comes full of the vibe of
this single word</p><p>'Rama'. This is simply a way to avoid the animal -- and the animal is
there.</p><p>You can go on chanting Rama for centuries... the animal is not going
to be changed by such a simple trick. You cannot deceive the animal. It
will remain only a very superficial religiousness. Scratch any religious
man and you will find the animal inside; just scratch a little. It is
not even skin-deep, the so-called religiousness. It only pretends, it is
only a formality, a social ritual.</p><p>You go to the church, you read the Bible, you read the Gita, you do
chanting, you do prayer, but it is all formal. Your heart is not in it.
And your animal inside goes on laughing at you, he ridicules you. He
knows you perfectly well, who you are, where you are. And he knows how
to manipulate you. You can go on chanting for hours, and then a
beautiful woman passes by and suddenly all chanting disappears and you
have forgotten all about God. Just the smell from the bakery... and all
is gone; Hare Krishna Rama, all is gone.</p><p>Just any small thing is enough! Somebody insults you and there is
anger, and the animal is ready to take revenge, you are in a rage. In
fact, religious people become more angry than anybody else -- because
others don't repress. And religious people are more sexually perverted
than anybody else, because others don't repress. The religious person's
dreams have to be watched, because in the day he can go on repressing,
but what about the night when he is asleep?</p><p>Mahatma Gandhi wrote that even at the age of seventy he was having
sexual dreams. At the age of seventy, why sexual dreams? He said, "In
the day I have become disciplined --</p><p>the whole day not even a single thought of sex comes to me. But in
the night I am incapable, I am unconscious, so the hole discipline and
control disappears."</p><p>Sigmund Freud's insight is very valuable, that to know about a man
you have to know his dreams, not his waking life. His waking life is
pseudo. His real life</p><p>asserts itself in his dreams, because his dreams are more natural --
no repression, no discipline, no control.</p><p>Hence, psychoanalysis does not bother about your waking life. Just
see the point: your waking life is so pseudo that psychoanalysis docs
not believe in it at all. It is worthless.</p><p>Psychoanalysis penetrates into your dreams because dreams are far
truer than your so-called waking life.</p><p>This is ironical that the waking life, which we think is real life is
not thought by psychoanalysis to be real; it is thought to be more
unreal than your dreams. Your dreams are far more real, because you are
not there to distort, you are fast asleep; the conscious mind is asleep
and the unconscious is free to have its say. And the unconscious is your
true mind, because the conscious is only one tenth of your total mind.
Nine tenths is the unconscious -- nine times more powerful, nine times
bigger than your conscious mind.</p><p>And what will you do when you are fighting with your sexuality,
anger, greed? You will go on throwing them into the unconscious, into
the darkness of the basement, thinking that by not seeing them you are
getting rid of them. You are not getting rid of them. Not even a man
like Mahatma Gandhi... what to say about small mahatmas like Morarji
Desai etc.</p><p>A man like Mahatma Gandhi continued to have sexual dreams. That
simply shows that his whole effort in the waking life was futile, that
whatsoever he was trying to do in the waking life was of no use. And he
recognized it -- at the very end of his life he recognized the whole
futility of his discipline. His whole life had been a wastage; he
recognized it. And in the end, just before he died, for two years he was
experimenting with the science of Tantra. It is not talked about, not at
least by the Gandhians -- they are very much afraid of those two years.
He was advised by his followers, "Please, don't do such
experiments."</p><p>You will be surprised: even Morarji Desai had advised him, "Don't do
such experiments!"</p><p>Why? They were afraid about the prestige of the Mahatma. They were
afraid about themselves too. But he was a man of courage; howsoever
wrong, he was a sincere man.</p><p>He had the courage to accept that his effort of disciplining
according to the traditional way had failed. In the last two years he
was sleeping with naked women -- just for the first time not repressing
but expressing, being loving, open, for the first time not on guard.</p><p>My own understanding is that those two years of his life which are
not talked about are the most important -- not only were they not talked
about: the followers deny, hide those facts. And those two years are the
most important in his life. In those two years, for the first time he
became aware that sexual energy need not be repressed: it can be
transformed.</p><p>His life was cut short because a fanatic from this very city, Poona,
killed him. Otherwise it would have been a totally different story. If
he had lived ten more years, then all these so-called Gandhians would
have left him. Many had already left when he started experimenting with
Tantra. If he had lived ten more years it would have been a great boon
to humanity, because he would have been able to say, "My whole life's
effort of repression failed while Tantra succeeded."</p><p>Ninety-nine percent of religious people go on repressing, and
whenever you repress something it goes deeper in you, it becomes more a
part of your being. And it starts affecting you in such subtle ways that
you may not even be aware of it. It takes very devious routes: it cannot
come in direct ways because if it comes directly, you Repress it.</p><p>Then it comes in such subtle ways, such devious ways, such deceptive
ways, with masks, that you cannot even recognize that it is
sexuality.</p><p>It can even use masks of prayer, of love, of religious ritual. But if
you go deep down, if you allow yourself to be exposed to somebody who
can observe and who understands the inner functioning of your mind, you
will be surprised that it is the same energy moving through different
channels. It has to move through different channels, because no energy
can ever be repressed.</p><p>Let it be understood once and for all: no energy can ever be
repressed. Energy can be transformed, but never repressed. The real
religion consists of alchemy, of transforming techniques, methods. The
real religion consists not of repressing the animal but of purifying the
animal, of raising the animal to the divine, using the animal, riding on
the animal to go to the divine. It can become a tremendously powerful
vehicle, because it is power.</p><p>Sex can be used as a great energy -- you call ride on it to the very
door of God. But if you repress it you will become more and more
entangled. This is a very modern approach, but the sutras of Kabir will
say to you that what Sigmund Freud discovered is not a discovery</p><p>-- it is only a discovery in the West. As far as the East is
concerned, it is an ancient truth.</p><p>The sages have always known about it.</p><p>These sutras are very beautiful, very scientific. Meditate over each
sutra: FRIEND PLEASE TELL ME WHAT I CAN DO ABOUT</p><p>THIS WORLD</p><p>I HOLD TO AND KEEP SPINNING OUT!</p><p>The original is:</p><p>AVADHU, MAYA TAJI NA JAI.</p><p>AVADHU LITERALLY MEANS A FRIEND, but it has a special meaning, not
just a friend. In English there is no word to give the real meaning of
AVADHU, but it can be explained. AVADHU means a friend, a companion, a
comrade, on the way towards the divine -- a special kind of friendship.
The friendship of two seekers, the friendship of those who are in search
of the unknown and the unknowable, the friendship of those who are ready
for the ultimate venture, who are ready to go into the uncharted sea.
AVADHU</p><p>means friends in the search for truth. It is risky; such a friendship
needs guts. It is no ordinary friendship -- it is utterly extraordinary,
it is not of this world.</p><p>This friendship means SATSANG: when many seekers gather together
around a man who has known, because such a friendship is possible only
around a man who has known, such a gathering is possible only around a
Buddha, around one who has awakened --</p><p>because he will function as the center of the commune. Without the
center, the commune will not have any significance; it will be an
ordinary crowd.</p><p>Without Christ, Christians are just a crowd, an ordinary crowd. With
Christ, it is a communion, it is satsang -- it is the ultimate
friendship. Christ can call his disciples AVADHU -- friends, comrades,
companions, soulmates -- that's exactly the meaning of AVADHU. The
friendship is not worldly, has no motive. The friendship is not that of
dependence. The friendship has no relationship which can be explained in
any worldly way -- but two souls in a deep rhythm, two soulmates.</p><p>It is difficult to search alone -- the path is arduous, hazardous.
dangerous; there is every possibility of getting lost. It is easier it
people move with friends. It is like Gurdjieff used to say... when he
was travelling in Sufi countries, a Sufi Master gave him a
technique.</p><p>The technique was that twenty friends of Gurdjieff had to go deep
into the desert, but at least one person had to remain awake. Including
Gurdjieff, there were twenty-one persons. Twenty persons could go to
sleep, but one had to be awake constantly, twenty-four hours a day. When
he WAS tired he had to wake somebody else; he could go to sleep, then
the other had to remain awake. But one had to be awake!</p><p>If you are alone you will have to fall asleep once in a while, but if
you are moving with friends at least one can always be awake. And in a
desert, or in a forest, in a jungle, it is needed that at least one
should be awake.</p><p>And when you go on the journey, the ultimate pilgrimage to God, it is
good to have a few friends with you, because at least one can always be
awake. And the person who is awake will become your protection, and the
person who is awake will help you not to go astray, and the person who
is awake will keep you together, and the person who is awake will become
a kind of glue which will integrate your energies.</p><p>But if you can find a man who is awake, twenty-four hours awake --
that's the meaning of being a Buddha -- then naturally a commune of
friends gathers around him. His light, his under-standing, slowly slowly
permeates their being too.</p><p>Kabir is not talking to the public -- he is talking to a few friends.
Hence he says: AVADHU, FRIENDS, MAYA TAJI NA JAI.</p><p>It is very difficult to drop this mind -- it is very difficult to
drop this mind</p><p>because who is going to drop it? Even the idea of dropping is part of
the mind. It is very difficult to drop the mind, because even if you
drop it the one who drops it will remain -- that will become your mind.
It is a very vicious circle. How to come out of it?</p><p>This mind is illusory, hence he calls it 'maya -- all illusion. It is
NOT really there; it has no substance, but still it persists
continuously -- day in, day out, your mind continues.</p><p>Thoughts, dreams, desires, imagination, memory... the traffic goes on
and on. All is non-substantial! If you wake up, suddenly you will find
all the dreams, all the desires, all the thoughts, have disappeared. But
how to drop this mind? Who is going to drop it? If you try to drop it,
you are the mind.</p><p>You can escape to the Himalayan caves but the mind will go with you,
because really the mind will be going to the Himalayan caves -- who
else? You can renounce the family, but who will renounce? You can stand
on your head, but it will be the same mind -- you are simply being
stupid. It has to be understood.</p><p>Nothing has to be done on your part, because anything done is done
always by the mind.</p><p>Doing is the very function of the mind. So nothing can be done with
the mind to drop it.</p><p>AVADHU, MAYA TAJI NA JAI.</p><p>So Kabir says: It is very difficult, friends, to drop this mind and
its illusions. In the first place they are so non-substantial -- if they
had been substantial it would have been easy.</p><p>You can Leave the house, you can renounce your wife, your children,
you can go away from the world -- it is very substantial! But how will
you leave your mind? It will be with you.</p><p>When Bayazid, a Sufi saint, went to see his Master, he re-nounced his
family, his friends, and he went to the Master. The Master used to live
in the ruins of an old mosque. When Bayazid entered he said, "Now I have
come, I have renounced all</p><p>-- please accept me."</p><p>The Master looked at Bayazid and looked around and said, "And why
have you brought this crowd with you?"</p><p>Bayazid was surprised. He looked back -- there was nobody else. Has
this man gone mad? He said, "What crowd are you talking about?"</p><p>And the Master said, "Don't look back -- look in. All those people
that you have left behind are there."</p><p>And Bayazid closed his eyes... and the Master was right, he was not
crazy. The wife was still crying, the children were telling him, "Daddy,
don't go." The friends were holding his hands to the very last. When he
said goodbye to them, they all followed him as far as possible; he had
to persuade them again and again, "Please go back. I have decided, and
my decision is absolute." And when he closed his eyes they were all
there.</p><p>And the Master said, "Bayazid, it is easy to renounce the world, but
how are you going to renounce the mind? Because the mind is the real
world! They are all there. You will sit meditating, and you will
remember your wife; you may not have ever remembered her when you were
with her -- that's how mind functions. That which is, it takes it for
granted; that which is not it hankers for. Now you will be more and more
involved with your wife, your children. More and more memories will
come: 'What is happening to my children? What is happening to my wife?
Has she betrayed me? Has she gone with somebody else? Can she do that?'
Jealousy, possessiveness, and all kinds of things are bound to
arise."</p><p>There is a beautiful story in Jaina scriptures:</p><p>A great king, Bimbisar, went to see Mahavira, the last Jaina
teerthankara -- the last Jaina prophet. On the way, he met one of his
old friends. They had studied in the same school; he was also a son of a
king, but he had renounced and he had become a Jaina monk -- he was
standing naked underneath a tree.</p><p>Bimbisar was overwhelmed with tremendous respect for this man and
started feeling a little guilty also about himself: "I am still involved
in the world -- money, power, prestige, war. And look at my friend: he
was also a king, he would also have been a king like me, but he has
renounced -- a man of courage." He bowed down, he touched the feet of
his old friend. Then he went to see Mahavira.</p><p>Just a few yards further away was Mahavira, sitting underneath a
tree. Bimbisar asked him, "One question arose in my mind -- when I saw
my old friend Prasannachandra, who has become a monk, a disciple of
yours, a question arose in my mind: if he dies right now, where will he
be born?"</p><p>Jainas say there are seven hells and seven heavens -- "Into what
heaven will he be born?"</p><p>Bimbisar asked. "Of course, there is no question of his being born in
hell -- he has renounced such a great kingdom and all -- in what
heaven?"</p><p>And Mahavira said, "He would have gone to the seventh hell -- if he
had died the time you touched his feet."</p><p>Bimbisar was shocked. He said, "Into the seventh hell? Then what
about me? There are no other hells below the seventh. My friend, who has
renounced all and looks so pious and so silent and so serene, he is
going to be born into the seventh hell?"</p><p>Mahavira said, "Don't be worried: if he dies now, he will be born
into the seventh heaven." And just a few minutes had passed.</p><p>Bimbisar said, "You puzzle me very much. Now you have confused me
even more. What has happened within these few minutes that he will be
born into the seventh heaven?"</p><p>Mahavira said, "You don't know the whole story. Just before you, your
prime minister had passed. He had come to accompany you just to see that
everything is safe. Your prime minister, your generals and your guards,
they passed just a few minutes before you.</p><p>And your prime minister said, 'Look at this fool, this
Prasannachandra! He would have been a great king and he has become
hypnotized by this Mahavira. And now standing naked in this heat,
wasting his life He used to be a beautiful</p><p>man -- now look at his body. And he is an utter fool, because he has
trusted his prime minister and has given the whole kingdom to him till
his children are grown up enough to take possession of it --</p><p>and the prime minister is a cheat. And by the time the children are
grown up, there will be nothing left in the treasury.'</p><p>"Hearing this, Prasannachandra forgot completely that he has become a
monk --</p><p>completely! He was so shocked and be-came so angry, and he said
inside his heart, 'I am still alive.' And his hand, just out of old
habit went to his sword -- which was not there.</p><p>He pulled the sword out of the sheath and said, 'I will go and kill
this man immediately.'</p><p>And in his imagination he cut the head of the prime minister.</p><p>"When you touched his feet," Mahavira said, "he had just killed the
prime minister.</p><p>Hence, I told you that in that moment if he had died he would have
gone to the seventh hell -- he was in a murderous attitude. Now, things
have changed. When he put his sword back into the sheath, he recognized,
'What am I doing? Where is the sword, and where is the sheath? And what
have I done? Killed my prime minister in imagination! It is as much a
crime as actually killing a person.</p><p>" 'Mahavira says, "Whether you think of killing or you kill, it makes
no difference -- it is the same, psychologically it is the same." What
have I done? When I have renounced, have renounced! Who am I to
interfere now? If he cheats that is HIS business; if he breaks the
trust, HE will suffer for it. But who am I to punish him? I am finished
with all this. And who are my children, and what is my kingdom?'</p><p>"And a great understanding came to him. He became quiet, silent,
serene, detached. Right now if he dies, he is in such a beautiful space
that he will be born in the seventh heaven."</p><p>The question is of the mind, not of the world. You can go to the
Himalayan caves, but what are you going to think about? You will think
of the world. That's why Kabir says: AVADHU MAYA TAJI NA JAI.</p><p>It is very difficult to drop this mind.</p><p>FRIEND, PLEASE TELL ME WHAT I CAN DO ABOUT THIS WORLD...</p><p>the world of the mind</p><p>... I HOLD TO, AND KEEP SPINNING OUT!</p><p>I GAVE UP SEWN CLOTHES AND WORE A ROBE,</p><p>BUT I NOTICED ONE DAY THE CLOTH WAS WELL WOVEN.</p><p>HE SAYS: I RENOUNCED BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES and wore a robe, but then one
day I saw, "Even this robe is well woven -- my mind has played a trick.
I am still as much concerned about my clothes as before. I still want to
look beautiful, I still want to look special, I still want to look
somebody. The mind has played a trick with me. I am the same man.</p><p>I have dropped those beautiful clothes and now I am wearing a single
robe, but it doesn't matter -- the mind can project in the same way."
The screen makes no difference: the film continues the same. You can use
the wall as the screen, and you can project the same film. You need not
have a perfect screen. The film is the same, even projected on the wall;
the wall may be rough, may be a poor man's house wall, but it makes no
difference</p><p>-- the film is the same.</p><p>Kabir says: I recognized it, "Mind is still functioning in the same
way. I still walk in such a way that people should recognize me, that I
am no ordinary man. I used to walk in my beautiful clothes -- why do
people use beautiful clothes? So that they look special. Now I am
wearing a robe, but still, deep down, the same desire persists."</p><p>The original is:</p><p>GIRAH TAJ KE BASTAR BANDHA, BASTAR TAJ KE FERI.</p><p>I have left the house, I have moved to the cave, with only a small
bag, but then one day I recognize that the cave has become the home, the
cave has become the house. And the small possession that I brought with
me can function perfectly well for my possessiveness. My possessiveness
remains the same! Now if somebody enters into the cave, I am going to
say, "Get out! This is my cave."</p><p>You can go and see this. Go to the Himalayas, enter into some cave
and some yogi will be sitting there, and he will say, "Get out! What are
you doing here? This is my cave. I have lived here for thirty years. If
you want to live in a cave, find your own."</p><p>Now what is the difference? -- 'my house' or 'my cave'. The question
is of 'my' and 'mine'.</p><p>So Kabir says: I left the house with a small bag, went to the cave,
but I found it was the same -- because I am the same. So I left the cave
and I left that small possession and became a wanderer, but nothing
changes. Now I feel great that I am a wanderer, that I am no ordinary
monk who lives in the shelter and safety of a cave. I live in insecurity
-- look!</p><p>This is how one should live. I am a wanderer with no security, no
safety. Now this wandering has become a prop to my ego.</p><p>GIRAH TAJ KE BASTAR BANDHA, BASTAR TAJ KE FERI.</p><p>Now I have become a vagabond, but great pride has arisen in me. SO I
BOUGHT SOME BURLAP, BUT I STILL</p><p>THROW IT ELEGANTLY OVER MY LEFT SHOULDER.</p><p>Seeing that the robe was well woven, I purchased coarse canvas and
made a shawl out of it -- BUT STILL I THROW IT ELEGANTLY OVER my
LEFT</p><p>SHOULDER. The same mind.</p><p>You can stand naked in the sun -- it doesn't matter: it will be the
same mind. How is one going to drop the mind? It comes from the
backdoor; it finds new ways to enter back into you.</p><p>I PULLED BACK MY SEXUAL LONGINGS,</p><p>AND NOW I DISCOVER THAT I'M ANGRY A LOT.</p><p>THIS IS OF TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCE TO UNDERSTAND. Kabir has</p><p>looked deep into the human mind and its workings, its subtle cunning
ways. And he has found exactly the whole process of inner alchemy. If
you repress, this is how things happen.</p><p>I PULLED BACK MY SEXUAL LONGINGS,</p><p>AND NOW I DISCOVER THAT I'M ANGRY A LOT.</p><p>If you repress sex you will become angry; the whole energy that was
becoming sex will become anger. And it is better to be sexual than to be
angry. In sex at least there is something of love; in anger there is
only pure violence and nothing else. If sex is repressed, the person
becomes violent -- either to others he will be violent, or to himself
These are the two possibilities: either he will become a sadist and will
torture others, or he will become a masochist and will torture himself.
But torture he will.</p><p>Do you know, down the ages, the soldiers have not been allowed to
have sexual relationships? Why? Because if soldiers are allowed to have
sexual relationships they don't gather enough anger in them, enough
violence in them. Their sex becomes a release, they become soft, and a
soft person cannot fight. Starve the soldier of sex and he is bound to
fight better. In fact, his violence will be a substitute for his
sexuality.</p><p>And Sigmund Freud is again right when he says that all our weapons
are nothing but phallic symbols: the sword, the knife, the bayonet --
they are nothing but phallic symbols.</p><p>The soldier has not been allowed to enter into somebody's body. into
some woman's body. Now he is going crazy to enter; now he can do
anything. A great perverted desire has entered into his being now.
Repressed sex -- he would like to enter into somebody's body through a
bayonet, through a sword...</p><p>Down the ages, the soldier was forced to repress his sexual
desires.</p><p>In this century we have seen one thing happening. American soldiers
are the most well-equipped soldiers in the world -- scientifically,
technologically, they are the most well-equipped soldiers, but they
proved weaker than any other soldier. In Vietnam, a poor country, for
years on end they tried and had to accept defeat. Why? For the first
time in history the American soldier is sexually satisfied -- that is
the problem. The first soldier in history who is sexually</p><p>satisfied, who is not starved sexually. He cannot win. A poor country
like Vietnam, a small country like Vietnam -- it is a miracle; if you
don't understand the psychology, it is a miracle. With all the
technology, with all the modern science, with all the power... and the
American soldier could not do anything.</p><p>But this is not new; this is an ancient truth. The whole history of
India proves it. India is a big country, one of the biggest, next only
to China, the second biggest country in the world, and it was conquered
many times by small countries. Turks, Mongols, Greeks --</p><p>anybody came and this big country was immediately defeated,
conquered. What was the reason? And those people who had come to conquer
were poor people, starving.</p><p>My own analysis of Indian history is that in the past India w as not
sexually repressed.</p><p>Those were the days when temples like Khajuraho, Konarak, Puri, were
built -- India was not sexually repressed. In spite of the few so-called
mahatmas, the greater part of the country was sexually satisfied; there
was a softness, a loving quality, a grace. It was difficult for India to
fight. For what? Just think of yourself: if you want to fight, you will
have to starve yourself sexually for a few days. You can ask Mohammed
Ali and other boxers: before they fight, for a few days they have to
become celibates. That's a must!</p><p>You can ask the Olympic competitors: before they participate in
Olympic competitions, for a few days they have to starve themselves
sexually. It gives a thrust, it gives great violence -- it makes you
capable of fighting. You run faster, you attack faster, because the
energy is boiling within. Hence the soldier has been repressed.</p><p>Just allow all the armies of the world to be sexually satisfied and
there will be peace. Just allow people sexual satisfaction, and there
will be less Hindu/Mohammedan riots, less Christian and Mohammedan
crusades -- all that nonsense will disappear. If love spreads, war will
disappear -- both cannot exist together.</p><p>Kabir is exactly right. He says:</p><p>I PULLED BACK MY SEXUAL LONGINGS,</p><p>AND NOW I DISCOVER THAT I'M ANGRY A LOT.</p><p>A great observer he is, a very minute observer. This is what
awareness is. He is watching: he represses his sexual desire and watches
-- "Now what is happening inside?" Soon he finds that he becomes more
angry -- for no reason at all, just angry, irritated, ready to fight
with anybody, any excuse will do.</p><p>And remember, sex can be transformed because it is a natural energy;
anger is not so natural, one step removed from nature. Now it will be
difficult to change anger. First anger will have to be changed into sex,
only then can anything be done -- that's what my work here is. And
that's what I am being condemned for all over the world.</p><p>I am trying to change your anger into sex -- first that has to be
done. That is the way of inner change. First all your perversions have
to disappear, and you have to become a natural human being. You have to
become a natural animal, to be exact. And then only can you become
divine. The animal can be transformed into the divine, but your animal
is also very perverted, your animal is not sane -- your animal has
become insane. First the insanity has to be transformed, changed. Change
anger!</p><p>That's why I send people first to encounter groups and then to
Tantra. First they have to go into some encounter group type phenomenon;
some process where their anger can be expressed, relaxed. Then only can
they move into some process of Tantra, into some inner alchemy that can
use sexual energy as a vehicle.</p><p>But people who are angry will not understand it. Anger does not allow
understanding.</p><p>Now if you want to become a politician, you have to repress your sex
-- otherwise you will not be able to compete, you will not be able to
reach New Delhi -- impossible. It is not an accident that Morarji Desai
has reached there -- fifty years of sexual repression is bound to help
him become the prime minister of the country. So much rage! It is
difficult to compete with such people; they go madly into competition.
They don't look sideways, they simply go ahead; they don't care what
happens. By fair or foul means, but they have to reach the top.</p><p>Politicians can succeed only if they are sexually repressed people.
Adolf Hitler was sexually repressed, very repressed. Had he been in deep
love with a single</p><p>woman there would have been no Second World War. Had he loved a
single human being deeply, the whole history of humanity would have been
different. But he was very sexually suppressed.</p><p>He was as big a mahatma as Morarji Desai -- in fact a little bigger.
He was a vegetarian, you will be surprised to know. To find a vegetarian
in Germany is difficult! but he was a vegetarian. He was not a smoker;
he was against drinking any kind of intoxicating beverages. He used to
go early to bed and would get up early in the morning. He avoided all
kinds of loving relationships -- what to say about love? -- he had not
even a single friend. There was not a single man vv-ho could call him
friend. He never allowed that much closeness. He was afraid,
continuously afraid of his sexuality.</p><p>This man became the cause of the greatest war the world has known. My
own feeling is that had he smoked a little bit, had he become drunk once
in a while, had he fallen in love with a woman, the whole history of
humanity would have been different. Then he would have been soft, then
he would have been more human, more accepting of his own limitations,
and hence more accepting of others' limitations. He would have been more
humane.</p><p>Says Kabir:</p><p>I PULLED BACK MY SEXUAL LONGINGS,</p><p>AND NOW I DISCOVER THAT I'M ANGRY A LOT. I GAVE UP RAGE, AND NOW I
NOTICE</p><p>THAT I AM GREEDY ALL DAY.</p><p>SO HE REPRESSED HIS ANGER -- hm? -- that s what one will logically
do. You repress sex, anger bubbles up; you repress anger. But he is a
close observer, a very minute observer. He says: The moment I repressed
my anger I became greedy.</p><p>This too is proved: if you watch human history you will find a
thousand and one proofs for it. For example, in India Mahavira taught
non-violence, and the result has been that all the followers of Mahavira
became the most greedy people in the world -- they are the Jews of
India. The Jainas are the Jews of India. Why did they become so
greedy?</p><p>Mahavira taught them to be non-violent. Obviously, they started
repressing anger; that is the only way that seems possible to the stupid
mind: Repress anger! Don't be violent.</p><p>And they tried really hard; in every possible way they tried not to
be violent. They even stopped agriculture because it is a kind of
violence: you will have to pull the plants and cut the crop, and that is
violence because plants have life. So Jainas stopped agriculture
completely.</p><p>Now, they cannot go to the army, they cannot be KSHATRIYAS -- they
cannot become warriors -- because of their ideology of non-violence, and
they cannot even be agriculturalists, gardeners; that is impossible.
They would not like to become SUDRAS --</p><p>the untouchables -- who clean the roads, the sweepers and the
cobblers, because that is too humiliating. And brahmins won't allow them
to function as brahmins -</p><p>- brahmins are very jealous about that. They have been in power for
centuries and they don't allow anybody: nobody can become a brahmin; one
has to be a brahmin only by birth. You may become a great, learned man
-- that doesn't matter -- but you can't be a brahmin. There is no way of
becoming a brahmin; you have to be born one only. You have to be very
careful when you choose your parents; that is the only opportunity to
become a brahmin.</p><p>So Jainas could not be brahmins, would not like to become SUDRAS were
not able to become warriors -- then what was left for them? Only
business -- they became business people. And all their repressed anger
became their greed. They became great money-maniacs. Their number is
very small; in India their number is so small, not more than thirty
LAKHS. In a country of sixty CRORES thirty LAKHS IS nothing. But they
possess more money than anybody else. You will not find a Jaina beggar
anywhere; they are all rich people.</p><p>Mahavira wanted them to be non-violent, and what really happened was
totally different: they became greedy. Repress your anger and you will
be greedy.</p><p>I GAVE UP RAGE AND NOW I NOTICE THAT I AM GREEDY ALL DAY.</p><p>I WORKED HARD AT DISSOLVING THE GREED,</p><p>AND NOW I AM PROUD OF MYSELF.</p><p>So he repressed his greed and the ultimate result is: he has become a
great egoist; he finds himself being very proud. "Look! I have repressed
sex, repressed anger, repressed greed -</p><p>- I have done this, I have done that. I have done impossible things!"
Now a great 'I' arises, the ego becomes strengthened.</p><p>That's wh you will find the most crystallized egos in the monks and
the nuns. You will not find such crystallized egos anywhere else. The
more a person renounces, the more he represses, the more egoistic he
becomes. Indians are very egoistic and the reason? -- they have all
tried in some way or other to be religious. And the only way seems to be
repression -- and repression brings ego.</p><p>A non-repressed person becomes a non-egoist; he cannot carry the ego.
There is no prop to support it. He becomes humble, he becomes simple, he
becomes ordinary, he has no claim -- he knows he is nothing. This whole
process that Kabir is describing is beautiful.</p><p>Repression is not the way: transformation is the way. Don't repress
anything. If sexuality is there, don't repress it otherwise you will
create a new complexity -- which will be more difficult to tackle. And
if you repress anger, greed is even more difficult then, and if you
repress greed, arises ego, pride, which is the MOST difficult thing to
drop.</p><p>Move back: from pride to greed, from greed to anger, from anger to
sex. And if you can come to the natural, spontaneous sexuality, things
will be very simple. Things will be so simple that you cannot imagine.
Then you energy is natural, and natural energy creates no hindrance in
transformation. Hence I say: from sex to superconsciousness. Not from
anger, not from greed, not from ego, but from sex to
superconsciousness.</p><p>The transformation can happen only if first you accept your natural
being. Whatsoever is natural is good. Yes, more is possible, but the
more will be possible only if you accept your nature with totality -- if
you welcome it, if you have no guilt about it. To be guilty, to feel
guilty, is to be irreligious. In the past you have been told just the
opposite: Feel guilty and you are religious. I say to you: Feel guilty
and you will never be religious.</p><p>Drop all guilt!</p><p>You are whatsoever God has made you. You are whatso-ever existence
has made you.</p><p>Sex is not your creation: it is God's gift. Something tremendously
valuable is hidden in it</p><p>-- it is just a shell of your samadhi. If the seed is broken, the
shell is broken, the flower will bloom -- but not by repression. You
will have to learn inner gardening, you will have to become a gardener,
you will have to learn how to use dirty fertilizers, manure, and
transform manure into roses.</p><p>Religion is the most delicate art.</p><p>WHEN THE MIND WANTS TO BREAK ITS LINK WITH</p><p>THE WORLD, says Kabir,</p><p>IT STILL HOLDS ON TO ONE THING.</p><p>AND THE ULTIMATE PROBLEM IS: you call leave one thing, but you cling
to another. You leave that and you cling to another. You go on changing
things, but the clinging remains. The clinging has to disappear. How can
the clinging disappear? Only by understanding, awareness, meditation;
not by doing anything about it. If you do, you will create a new
clinging.</p><p>An ancient story:</p><p>A man was very much afraid of ghosts, and the problem was more
troublesome because he had to pass through a cemetery every day while
going to work and coming back from work. And sometimes, if he had to
come in the night -- overtime work or something and he was delayed --
then it was really a problem to pass through the cemetery. It was only a
three, four minute walk, but it was almost a death to him.</p><p>He went to a fakir and he said, "Do something. I have heard you do
miracles. And I don't ask much -- I ask only a simple thing: give me
somehow some protection so that I can pass through the cemetery without
fear."</p><p>He said, "This is so simple, there is no problem in it. Take this
locket and keep it always with you -- it will protect you from ghosts.
No ghost can ever trouble you."</p><p>He tried and, really, no ghost troubled him. In fact, there are no
ghosts; it was only his fear. With the locket in hand, he went through
the cemetery, from this side to that, from that side to this. He tried
at different times, even in the middle of the night -- and it worked.
And he said, "It is really powerful. this locket! This man is a miracle
man."</p><p>The whole miracle was this: that there were no ghosts -- there are no
ghosts anywhere.</p><p>But now this idea that he had a protection helped him.</p><p>But then a new problem arose: he started becoming afraid that
somebody might steal it, or some day he might forget it somewhere, or he
might have put it outside and be taking a bath and ghosts might come
there So he had to carry it</p><p>everywhere -- it became an obsession. The wife would say, "It looks
embarrassing. People ask me, 'Why does your husband go on carrying this
locket in his hand, this stupid locket? What is the matter with him? He
never leaves it.'" Even in the night when he went to sleep he would keep
it in his hand. Even once or twice in the night he would wake up to see
whether the locket was in his hand or not, because it might have fallen
in his sleep, and ghosts might jump on his chest: "And they must be
waiting to take revenge!"</p><p>Now one problem is solved, another problem has arisen -- and far more
complicated, because the ghosts used to torture him only once in a while
when he was late or he had to pass through the cemetery. In twenty-four
hours, just for one or two minutes the problem was there. Now it was a
twenty-four-hour problem -- the locket: "If it is lost, if somebody
takes it away, if I forget it somewhere " Even in sleep it was difficult
to sleep totally.</p><p>He had to keep a little alert. He started becoming ill because the
sleep was not good, and he was so constantly afraid.</p><p>He went to another fakir who said, "I will give you another thing.
Keep this box; this locket is creating trouble -- this box is far more
powerful. You can even keep it six feet away from you and its power
works."</p><p>He said, "This is far better. At least I can go into my bathroom
leaving it outside."</p><p>But now the new problem arose. The locket he was always keeping in
his hand; now he was taking the bath inside and the box was
outside..."If children, just in playing, take it away or something
happens?!" Now it was even more difficult: that six foot distance.</p><p>The story is significant: this is not the way to drop the ghosts! You
will have to cling to something or other. The ghosts are not to be
dropped; your eyes have to be opened so that you can see that there are
no ghosts at all. The problem disappears. The problem is not solved but
dissolved.</p><p>WHEN THE MIND WANTS TO BREAK ITS LINK WITH THE WORLD</p><p>IT STILL HOLDS ON TO ONE THING.</p><p>And unless you drop ALL clinging -- ALL clinging, I say -- unless you
are ready to be nothing, empty, nobody, with no protection, with no
security, no safety, unless you are ready to be in that kind of space...
which will look like death in the beginning. And it is a kind of death:
the old dies, but then the new arises. And the new can arise only when
the old is gone. The old has to cease for the new to be. Only when all
clinging disappears --</p><p>you are not clinging even to the name of God, you are not clinging
even to the Master, you are not clinging to the scripture, you are
simply in a state of nonclinging -- then suddenly from your own inner
source a great light wells up, a great bliss wells up. You are
transformed.</p><p>Mind is not dropped -- it is a ghost. And if you try methods to drop
it, you will cling to the methods. Then those methods will torture you.
But you will remain always in bondage.</p><p>KABIR SAYS: LISTEN MY FRIEND,</p><p>THERE ARE VERY FEW THAT FIND THE PATH!</p><p>A FEW PEOPLE REMAIN INDULGENT, remain animals; a few people start</p><p>repressing the animal, become obsessed with repressions, perversions.
Only rarely does it happen that a person is neither indulgent, nor
repressive -- only when a person is neither does he find the secret key
to the door of the divine.</p><p>The original is:</p><p>MAN BAIRAGI MAYA TYAGI, SHABD MEN SURAT SAMAI.</p><p>Kabir says: I have become a sannyasin, a renunciate, I have dropped
the world, but that doesn't matter. Now I cling to God, now God has
become my world.</p><p>MAN BAIRAGI MAYA TYAGI, SHABD MEN SURAT SAMAI.</p><p>Now the name of God -- SHABD -- has become my treasure, now I cling
to it. Now the idea of God has become the center of my clinging.</p><p>KAHAIN KABIR SUNO BHAI SADHO, YAH GAM BIRLE PAI.</p><p>Very few people there are who have found the secret path. Out of a
hundred, ninety remain indulgent in the animal; they never move beyond
the animal. Out of the remaining ten, nine become repressive and
pathological. Only one out of a hundred finds the true way. What is the
true way?</p><p>The true way is that of understanding your mind, not of dropping it.
The true way is: sitting silently and watching your mind -- all its
cunning ways, subtle ways, all its strategies -- just watch, just be a
witness to your mind. And, slowly slowly, by witnessing it you will
understand what games it has been playing with you. You stop it from one
door, it comes from another door; you stop it from that door, it makes a
third door -- and it goes on and on, ad nauseam.</p><p>Watch.… Don't renounce the world, and don't try to drop the mind.
Just become more alert. In that alertness, suddenly mind disappears, and
with the mind disappears the whole world. And when there is no mind and
no world, God is.</p><p>The Fish in the Sea is Not Thirsty Chapter #14</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

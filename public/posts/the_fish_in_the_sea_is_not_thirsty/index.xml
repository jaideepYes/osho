I LAUGH WHEN I HEAR THAT THE FISH IN THE WATER IS THIRSTY.
YOU DON&#39;T GRASP THE FACT THAT WHAT IS MOST ALIVE OF ALL IS INSIDE YOUR OWN HOUSE;

The first question Question 1
OSHO, HOW CAN REBELLION BE RECEPTIVE, FEMININE, YES- SAYING? IT
FEELS SO MUCH LIKE A NO TO ALL THESE OLD THINGS. IS IT JUST AWARENESS AND LOVE THAT IS IT?
Prem Mariam,
REVOLUTION IS NO, REBELLION IS YES.</description>

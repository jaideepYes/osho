ENTER YE IN AT THE STRAIT GATE: FOR WIDE IS THE GATE, AND BROAD IS THE WAY, THAT LEADETH TO DESTRUCTION, AND MANY THERE BE WHICH GO IN THEREAT:\n14. BECAUSE STRAIT IS THE GATE, AND NARROW IS THE WAY, WHICH LEADETH UNTO LIFE, AND FEW THERE BE THAT FIND IT.\nMan is mind.\nThe word ‘man’ itself comes from the Sanskrit root man, which means mind. If you understand the workings of the mind, you will understand the reality of man and the possibility too. If you understand the inner mechanism of the mind, you will understand the past of man, the present and the future too.\nMan in himself is not a being but a passage. In himself man is not a being, because man is continuously a becoming. There is no rest in being a man. Rest is below man or above man. Below is nature, above is God. Man is just in between – a link, a ladder. You cannot rest on a ladder, you cannot stop on the ladder. The ladder cannot become your abode. Man has to be surpassed, man has to be transcended.\nMan is a journey between your two infinities. One is your nature, one infinity; another is your hidden God, the other infinity. And man is just between the two, a ferry boat. Use it, but don’t be confined by it. Use it, but don’t be defined by it. Always remember that you have to go beyond.\nThe whole message of Jesus is how to go beyond man. That’s why he again and again says: I am the Son of man and the Son of God. He goes on insisting on this contradiction, because he wants\nit to be completely clear that man is both: on the one hand part of nature, on the other hand part of God. That is the meaning of the word ‘son’: son means a part of the father.\nAnd because man belongs to these two realities – two separate realities – there is anxiety in mall, there is tension in man, there is constant conflict in man, because these two natures go on fighting. Hence, as man, there is no possibility of peace. Either you have to become absolutely unconscious, like a drunkard when he has taken so much alcohol that he has lost all his consciousness – then there is peace, or you will have to become so conscious that all the nooks and corners of your being are full of light – you become a Buddha or a Christ – then there is peace. Either fall below man, or go beyond man. Don’t go on clinging to being a man, because then you are clinging to a disease.\nThat’s exactly what man is: a disease, a constant tension – to be or not to be, to be this or to be that – a constant fight between the soul and the body, the lower and the higher, unconsciousness and consciousness. To understand man as a conflict, to understand man as a constant tension will help immensely, because then you stop clinging to man as such. Rather, on the contrary, you start thinking ‘How to go beyond, how to transcend, how to surpass?’\nFriedrich Nietzsche is right when he says that mall is the only animal who tries to surpass himself, the only animal who can surpass himself. It is the greatest miracle in the world: to surpass oneself. But it has happened. It has happened in a Christ, in a Buddha, in a Krishna. It can happen in you! You are a great promise, a project, an adventure. But don’t start thinking about yourself as if you have arrived. Then you cling somewhere in between, and a part of you will be pulled to one side and the other part to another side – you will be torn apart. And you will remain in anguish, and your existence will be nothing but a long long on-going nightmare.\nBefore we enter the sutras, a few things about the mind – because man is mind.\nThe first state of mind we can call ‘pre-mind’. It exists in a very small child – very primitive, animal- like. Hence the beauty of the children, and the innocence, and the grace – because that anxiety which we call man has not yet evolved. The child is at ease. The child is not yet a traveller, he has yet not left his home in search for some other home. The pilgrimage has not started yet. The child is at rest – perfectly at ease and happy to be whatsoever he is. That’s why his eyes have no anxiety, and the child has a certain grace around him.\nBut this grace is going to be lost. This grace cannot stay forever, because it is unconscious, because it has not been earned, because it is a natural gift, and the child is completely oblivious to it. He cannot hold onto it. How can you hold onto something when you are unconscious of it? It has to be lost. The only way to gain it is to lose it. The child will have to go into corruption, into perversion. The child will have to go into the cunningness of the mind, and then the child will understand that he has lost something – something immensely valuable.\nBut one can know it only when it is lost. There is no other way to know it. Then the search starts. Religion is nothing but the search for the lost childhood. Everybody carries the memory of it, the very alive memory of it, somewhere deep down. Maybe not very consciously, but it functions like an unconscious substratum that something has been lost, something has been forgotten, something was there which is no more there; something is being missed, and one starts searching for it.\nThe first stage is pre-mind. There is no responsibility, because a child knows nothing of duty, the child knows nothing of values, virtues. The child knows nothing of sainthood, so he is not aware of sin either. He exists before the diversion, he exists before those two paths of sin and sainthood diverge, separate and go apart. He is in a kind of primitive unity. This cannot last for long, this is going to go, but it has not gone yet. This is the state of the child nearabout three years of age.\nBetween three and four the child loses his innocence, loses his virginity, loses nature and becomes part of the civilised world – really becomes man.\nThis pre-mind is instinctive. It is very intelligent, but the intelligence is not intellectual, the intelligence is purely instinctive. The child functions very intelligently but not intellectually. The intelligence that a child shows is natural, he has not learned it. It is part of the wisdom of his body, it is inherited.\nThe child has no idea of good and bad, so there is never any conflict. His desires are pure. Whatsoever he desires, he desires passionately, totally. No problem arises in his mind whether this desire is right or wrong. Whenever he is in a certain mood, he is totally in it – but his moods are momentary. He has no identity, he is unpredictable: one moment he is loving, another moment he is angry. And you cannot tell him ‘You are contradictory’; he is very inconsistent because he is always true to the moment. Not that he does anything consciously, it is just natural.\nSo the innocence is there, but it is not very deep. The innocence is there, but it has no meditativeness in it. It is shallow, momentary, temporary, tentative.\nThe child is more like an animal than like a man. The child is the link between the man and the animal. The child passes through all the stages that man has passed through down the ages. The scientists say that during nine months in the mother’s womb the child passes through millions of years of evolution. He starts like a fish – as life started on the earth – and then by and by, he goes on growing. Within days he is passing through thousands, millions of years; in nine months he has passed through the whole of evolution. But even when the child is born, he is still not yet man – not at least, civilised – he is primitive, the cave-man.\nThe child lives in an inner chaos. He has no idea what he is going to do. He has no future, he carries no past; he lives utterlY in the present. But because he lives utterly in the present and unconsciously, his life cannot have a discipline, an order. It is chaotic, it is anarchic. This is the first stage of man, the first stage of mind. And remember, that although sooner or later you lose it, it remains like a substratum in you. You can lose it totally only when meditation has gone deep, when meditation has transformed your being. Otherwise it remains there, and you can fall into it at any moment; in any stress, in any strain you can again become childish.\nFor example, your house is on fire, and you can start crying like a child. And you are not a man who cries ordinarily – nobody may have ever seen you crying. And your house is on fire and suddenly you forget that you are a grown-up man. You become like a small child, you start crying – tears come to your eyes – yoU are completely lost, helpless. What has happened? That pre-mind has reclaimed you. It was always there. You had grown a second layer upon it, on top of it, but it was there deep down. When the second layer cannot function. in a deep helplessness you fall to the first layer. This happens every day.\nIn anger you become more childish, in love also you become more childish. Listen to the dialogue of two lovers, and you will find it very childish. Remember your own memories when you first fell in love: how you behaved, what you said to your beloved or your lover, and you will find childishness. Or remember when somebody provokes you and you become angry – you start doing things which are very illogical, unintelligent. undisciplined, chaotic. You repent for them later on, because later on, when the second layer comes back, the second layer repents for the first layer. When the civilized mind comes back, takes hold again, it repents. It says ‘It was not good of me. It was not good to do.’\nThe first layer never completely goes unless you become a Christ or a Buddha. It remains there. Watch it.\nThe first layer is very chaotic. The second layer is collective. The second mind I call the ‘collective mind’. Now the group, the family, the society, the nation become more important than yourself. A child is very very self-oriented, he thinks only of himself. He does not care for anything else, he is utterly selfish. The second mind starts thinking of others, starts sacrificing its own interests, becomes more collective, becomes more part of society, a clan, a tribe – starts becoming civilised. Civilisation means to become part of a society, to become part of many people: to become responsible, not to go on living a selfish existence. Civilisation means sacrificing oneself for others.\nThis second mind is very prevalent. Except in very rare cases, the first mind sooner or later disappears. Some imbeciles, idiots – in them the first layer never disappears, it remains predominant. They never learn how to be social, they remain primitive. Otherwise, normally the second layer evolves – the schooling, the family training, the teachers, the Society, the experiences, the observation... And the child starts learning that he is not an island, but a member of an organism – the society, the church, the nation.\nThis second, collective mind has a certain identity. The first mind knows no identity. If you ask a child ‘Who are you?’ he can’t answer it. He does not know the answer – who he is. But a grown-up person can say ‘Yes, I am a Catholic, I am a communist, I am a Hindu, I am an Indian, I am a German, I am an Italian.’ What is he saying? He is saying ‘I belong to this group called Hindu, or Christian, or Mohammedan. I belong to this nation, to this geography – India, Germany. Italy.’ Or ‘I belong to this ideology – communism, Catholicism, fascism.’He is saying ’I am to whom I belong’.\nNow he has an identity. He can say ‘I am a doctor, or an engineer, or a businessman’ – then too he is saying ‘This is what I do. This is my function in the society.’ When you ask somebody ‘Who are you?’ – he answers by showing you where he belongs, to whom he belongs, what his function is in the society. Now this is not much of a self-knowledge. If this is self-knowledge then everybody knows who he is. But for utilitarian purposes it is enough, and many people stop there.\nIf you stop there you will never know who you are. Then you have taken just a false identity. Just a few labels, and you think ‘This is me’. This is not you. You exist on a far higher plane, or in a deeper depth. These labels that you have collected about yourself are good for functioning in the society as a member, but they don’t show anything about your reality. The inward reality remains untouched by them. But this is the second layer where almost everybody stops. The society does not want you to go beyond it. The school, the college, the university – their effort is that you should not remain childish, you should become civilised, and then their effort ends. Then the society’s work is finished.\nThe society has made you a member of the mass, has made you a kind of slave, has given you a certain imprisonment, has taken all that was dangerous in you – the chaos, the freedom, the irresponsibility; has made you dutiful, responsible, given you values what is good and what is not good; has pigeonholed you, categorised you. Now the society is finished. Now live silently, go to the office, come home, take care of your children, your parents, and so on and so forth – one day, die: your existence is complete. This is a very false completion: a routine existence.\nFriedrich Nietzsche has called this state ‘the camel’, the beast of burden. This is the ‘camel state’. People go on carrying great loads and burdens for no reason at all. And they go on moving in a desert, like the camel moves in a desert. You can see these camels all around dry, dull, dead, still carrying, carrying great loads. The loads are crushing them, killing them, but they are carrying – maybe just out of habit. Because yesterday also they were carrying and the day before yesterday also they were carrying; it has become part of their habit, it has become part of their definition. Their load, their anxiety, their sadness, their misery have become part of their definition, their identity. These camels you will find everywhere, and this desert is all over the earth.\nThe child has to come from the first to the second, but nobody should stop there. To be a camel is not the goal. Something more is needed, something more existential is needed. Yes, you will have respectability if you are a good camel and carry great loads. People will respect you, they will all show honour towards you. That’s a kind of mutual understanding. When a person is Carrying so much load, he has to be given some awards – that’s what respect is.\nThe word ‘respect’ is beautiful, it means to look again: respect. When a person is carrying a great load of responsibility, duty, family, society, people look at him and say ‘Look, what a great man!’ Re-spect: they look again and again and they say ‘Look! How much of a burden he is carrying. What sacrifice!’ He has sacrificed his whole being.\nNaturally if you sacrifice yourself for the religion, the religion will sanctify you, will call you a saint. If you sacrifice for the country, the country will give you respect. If you sacrifice for something else, they will give you respect. One can go on collecting this respect, and one can go on dying without living at all. Beware of this situation!\nIn this state, there is a collective responsibility: the collective mind functions; you don’t have a personal responsibility yet. The child has no responsibility. The second stage has a responsibility, hut it is collective. You don’t feel PERSONALLY responsible for anything, you feel responsible only because you are part of a certain collectivity.\nIn an Indian village you can find this state the camel very very pronounced. A BRAHMIN has no responsibility of his own. His whole responsibility is that he is a BRAHMIN, he has to behave like a brahmin. In Indian villages you will not find individualities, you will only find collectivities. The BRAHMIN, the SHUDRA, the KSHATRIYA – they all function according to their community, according to the rules. Nobody has any responsibility to think, there is no question of thinking. The rules have been given down the ages, they are written in the scriptures. Everything is clear-cut – there is no need to speculate, to philosophise, to ponder, to meditate. All problems have been solved – Manu, the Indian Moses, has solved them.\nThat’s where Jesus found the Jews – at the second stage. Moses had done the first work, he had brought the primitive mind to a civilised state. Now Jesus was needed to bring another revolution,\nanother transformation. People were existing just as cogs in a wheel, parts of a great mechanism. The only question was how to function efficiently.\nThat is not enough to live a joyous life. To be efficient is because the efficiency makes you a good mechanism but does not give you a soul. It does not give you a celebration, it can’t be ecstatic. But there are a few beautiful things about the second mind you have to remember; they will help you to understand the third.\nThe second mind is non-tense: there is no anxiety in it. The Indian villager, or the people of the East are more calm, quiet. They move with a certain ease, dignity. Even if they are starving, hungry, ill, they have a patience, a deep accep-tance. They don’t rebel. Rebellion has no appeal for them, they live in acceptance. They don’t have that much individual-ity to rebel. Indians feel very good about it, they think America is going mad; they think ‘We are fortunate.’ But this is not my observation.\nAmerica is in a difficulty. America is in great anguish, but that anguish is higher than the so-called Indian peace. That anguish can be more creative, that anguish can bring a higher stage of mind and consciousness into the world than this cow-like peace. This peace is not very creative. Yes, it is good in a way – one lives one’s life without much anguish. But nothing comes out of that life. Just peaceful and peaceful, and that peace is never creative – creative of something out, or creative of something in. That peace seems to be very impotent. But in this second stage the peace is there, obedience is there, patience is there, and there is a feeling of belonging to the community, to the church. Nobody feels alone.\nIn America people are very alone. Even in a crowd they are alone. In India, even if people are alone, they are not alone. They know they belong, they know they have a certain function somewhere, they know they are needed. They know that they need not choose, everything has been chosen beforehand. A BRAHMIN is born a BRAHMIN. He will be respected by the society, he will become the priest. He has not to work for it, it is already decided by fate, by God.\nWhen you don’t have to decide, naturally you don’t feel any anxiety. Decision brings anxiety. You have to decide, then there is a problem. Then to go this way or that? and there are a thousand ways, and so many alternatives – and choose in trembling, because who knows whether you are choosing the right or the wrong? The only way to know is to choose it. But then it will be too late. After ten years if you come to know that it was a wrong choice it will be too difficult to go back and choose again, because then those ten years will be gone – gone down the drain.\nThere is a kind of belonging in the second state of mind. You need not choose, everything has been chosen, decided already; there is a kind of fatalism. All that happens has to be accepted because it cannot be otherwise. If it cannot be otherwise then why be worried? That’s why in India there are less psychological breakdowns than in America. But it is not a good state, remember. And I am not saying that a psychological breakdown is a great thing, and I am not saying that to be tense and to be anxious is something valuable. But I am saying that just not to be anxious and not to be tense is not some achievement either.\nThis state – the second state – is a kind of patriarchy. The father remains very important. The father-figures are very important. God is thought to be a father.\nThere is a difference between the mother and the father. The father is very demanding, the mother is non-demanding. Mother’s love is unconditional, father’s love is conditional. The father says ‘Do this then I will love you; if you don’t do this you will not get my love.’ And the father can get very angry.\nThis state is a state of patriarchy: father remains important, mother is not important. Unconditional love is not known. Society appreciates you, respects you if you follow the society. If you go a little bit astray, all respect is taken away and the society is ready to destroy you. The Jewish God says ‘I am a very jealous God. If you go against me I will destroy you!’ – and that’s what the state says, the government says, the priest says, the pope says. They are all very jealous. They are very dominating.\nThis state is very repressive: it does not allow anybody to have his own say, it does not allow anybody to have his own being. It is repressive: it does not allow one’s own impulses. It is dictatorial: it teaches you to say yes; no is not accepted, yes is enforced violently, aggressively. Of course this yes cannot be of much value, because if you cannot say no your yes is going to be impotent. But this is the yes that exists all around. People believe in God because they have been told to believe in God. People go to the church because they have been told to go to the church. People go on doing things formally, ritualistically. Jesus called these people hypocrites.\nBefore we enter into the sutras, these things will be good to understand, then the sutras will be very very clear.\nThis state of mind has only a painted exterior, the interior remains untouched, unevolved. A kind of theism – people believe in God, people believe in hell and heaven, and people believe in punishment and reward – but people believe, people don’t know. Yes is there, but it has been forced. It has not been given a chance to evolve and unfold within you. There is a communal solidarity because you are never alone, you are always together with people, and the crowd is all around you and it feels good. The moment you are alone, trembling arises. When the great crowd is all around you, you can trust. So many people can’t be wrong, so you must be right, because so many people are going in the same way, in the same direction, and you are also going with them.\nThe third mind I call the ‘individual mind’; Nietzsche calls it ‘the lion’. It is independence, it is assertion, it is rebellion. The ego has evolved. The ego has become very very crystallised. The man is no more just a part of a church, country, tribe, clan, family; he is himself. The real culture can only start when you have become an individual. The sense of the self is a must, and this is the third stage of the mind.\nThe identity is no more of belonging, the identity is no more that you are a Hindu, or a Mohammedan, or a Christian. The identity is more personal – that you are a painter, that you are a poet. The identity is more creative; it is not of belonging but of contribution – what you have contributed to the world.\nIn the nebulous mind a centre arises by and by. In the child’s mind there was no centre. In the collective mind there was a false centre imposed from the outside. In the individual mind an inner centre arises. The first was a kind of chaos – no order. The second was a kind of patriarchy – an imposed order by the father, by the demanding society and the father-figures. The third is a kind of fraternity: a brotherhood arises. You don’t belong to any crowd; nobody can impose anything upon\nyou, nor do you want to impose anything upon anybody. You respect others’ freedom as much as you respect your own freedom. All are brothers.\nIn the first, the basic question was ‘Who is the father-figure?’ In the second, the question is not who is the father-figure – there is none, God is dead. That is the situation in which Nietzsche declares that God is dead: God, as father, is dead. That is the situation where Buddha says there is no God, and Mahavir says there is no God. And Patanjali says that God is just a hypothesis – needed in certain stages, and then is needed no more.\nResponsibility arises, and a very personal responsibility. You start feeling responsible for each of your acts, because now you know what is right and what is wrong. Not that somebody says ‘This is right’, but because you feel this is right, because you feel this is good. A greater understanding, a greater consciousness will be needed. There will be more joy because you will be more crystallised, but there will be more anxiety too, because now if something goes wrong you go wrong. And you alone are responsible for each step. You cannot look to a father-figure, and you cannot throw your responsibility onto somebody else – no fate, no father exists, you are left alone on the road, with thousands of alternatives. and you have to choose. And each choice is going to be decisive, because you cannot go back in time. Great anxiety arises. This is the place where people start having psychological breakdowns. This is a higher stage than the second, and the West exists at a higher stage than your so-called East. But of course there are problems. And those problems can be solved, and those problems should be solved rather than slipping back to a lower stage of mind.\nThere is freedom, so there is tension. There is thinking, there is concentration – abstract philosophy is born, science grows, and no becomes very important. Doubt becomes very significant. In the collective mind faith was the rule; in the individual mind doubt becomes the rule. No becomes very basic, because rebellion cannot exist without no, and the ego cannot grow and ripen without no. You have to say no to a thousand and one things, so that you can say yes to the one thing you would like to say yes to. Now the yes is significant, because the man is capable of saying no. Now the yes has a potency, power.\nThe man who always says yes – his yes is not of much worth. But the man who says no ninety-nine times and says yes one time – he means it. It has an authenticity.\nIt is a very creative crisis because if you go above it, it will be creative. If you fall from it, you will not fall to the second, you will fall to the first. This has to be understood. If you fall from the third, the individual mind, you will go immediately into madness, because the second is no more possible. You have learnt no-saying, you have learnt being rebellious, you have tasted freedom, now you cannot fall back to the second. That door no more exists for you. If you fall from the third you will fall to the first: you will go mad.\nThat’s exactly what happened to Friedrich Nietzsche himself. He was a ‘lion’, but the lion went mad, roaring and roaring and roaring, and could not find a Way beyond the third.\nWhen a man falls from the third, he falls to the first. This has to be remembered. Then you cannot go to the second – that is finished forever. Once your no has become very conscious you cannot go back to faith. A man who has doubted, and who has learnt to doubt, cannot go to faith again – that is impossible. Now the faith will be simply Cunningness and deception, and you cannot deceive\nyourself. Once a man has become an atheist then ordinary theism won’t do. Then he will have to find a man like me. Then ordinary theism won’t do – he has gone beyond it.\nNietzsche needed a man like Buddha. And because Buddha was not available, and because the Western mind has not yet been able to make it possible for people to go beyond the third, he had to go mad. In the West it is almost a certainty that whenever a person becomes really evolved at the third stage, he starts slipping into madness, because the fourth is not available there yet. If the fourth is available, then the third is very creative. If there is a possibility to surrender the ego, then the ego is of immense value. But the value is in its surrender! If you cannot surrender it, then it will become a load – a great load on you. It will be unbearable. Then the lion will go on roaring and roaring and there will be no other way than to go mad.\nThis is a very critical stage – the third; it is just in the middle. Two minds are below it and two minds are above it. It is exactly the mid-link. If you fall, you go into the abyss of madness; if you rise, you go into the beatitude of being a Christ or a Buddha.\nThe fourth mind is ‘universal mind’. Remember, it looks collective but it is not collective. ‘Collective’ means belonging to a society, a certain time, a certain period, a certain country. ‘Universal’ means belonging to the whole existence, to existence as such. The ego, when ripe, can be dropped; in fact, drops itself if the fourth door is available. And that is the function of religion: to make the fourth door available. That is the problem in the .West now: the third mind has developed to its uttermost, and the fourth door is not available. The West URGENTLY needs the fourth door.\nCarl Gustav Jung has said in his memoirs that through observing thousands of people in his whole life, he has come to a few conclusions. One conclusion is that people who are nearabout forty to forty-five are always facing a religious crisis. Their problem is not psychological, their problem is religious. Near the age of forty-two, forty-five, a man starts looking for the fourth mind. If he cannot find it, then he goes berserk. Then the hunger is there and the nourishment is not available. If he can find it, great beatitude, great benediction arises.\nIt is almost like at the age of fourteen you become sexually mature. Then you start looking for a partner – for a woman, for a man. You want a love object – near the age of fourteen. Exactly near the age of forty-two another thing in you matures, and you start looking for SAMADHI, for meditation, for something that goes higher than love, something that goes higher than sex, something that can lead to a more eternal orgasm, more total orgasm. If you can find it then life remains smooth. If you cannot find the door – hunger has arisen and the nourishment is not available – what will you do? You start breaking down: your whole structure is shaken. And when a man breaks down. he always breaks down to the first; he falls to the lowest.\nThis fourth I call the ‘universal mind’ – the ego can be dissolved because the ego has matured. Remember, let me repeat: the ego can be dissolved only when it has become mature. I am not against the ego, I am all for it – but I don’t confine myself to it. One has to go beyond it.\nJust the other day I was reading Frankl’s book. He says ‘We must be willing to discard personality.’ Why should we be willing to discard personality? And how can you discard personality if you have not grown it? Only the perfectly ripe can be discarded.\nWhat is personality? Personality is a PERSONA, a mask. It is needed. The child has no mask, that’s why he looks so animal-like. The collective mind has a mask, but imposed from the outside; it has no interior definition of its being. The egoist, the individual mind, has an interior definition; he knows who he is, he has a kind of integration. Of course, the integration is not ultimate and will have to be dropped, but it can be dropped only when it has been attained.\n‘We must be willing to discard personality. God is no respecter of persons.’ That’s true. God loves individuals, but not persons. And the difference is great. A person is one who has an ego definition. An individual is one who has dropped his ego, and knows who he is. A person is a circle with a centre; and the individual is a circle without the centre – just pure space.\n‘The personality is only a mask, it is a theatrical creation, a mere stage-prop.’ The longing for freedom, salvation or NIRVANA, means simply the wish to be relieved of your so-called personality and the prison that it creates.\n‘The trouble with the self is that it is derived from others.’ Your ego is also derived from others. You depend for your ego on the others. If you go to the Himalayas and sit in a cave, what ego will you have? By and by the ego will start disappearing. It needs support. Somebody needs to appreciate it. Somebody needs to say to you that you are a beautiful person. Somebody needs to go on feeding it. The ego can exist only in society. Although it tries to get rid of society, in a subtle, unconscious way it remains dependent on the society.\n‘The trouble with the self is that it is derived from others. It is constructed in an attempt to live up to the expectation of others. The others have become installed in our hearts, and we call them ourselves.’\nThe self is not you. It belongs to others who surround you. It exists in you, but it is possessed by others. That’s why it is so easy to manipulate an egoistic person. That’s what flattery is: flattery is a trick to manipulate the egoistic person. You go and say to him that he is the greatest man in the world, and he is ready to fall at your feet; you are manipulating. He knows, you know and everybody else knows that this is just false. He also knows that he is not the greatest man in the world, but he will believe it. He would like to believe it. And he would like to do anything that you want him to do. At least one person in the world believes that he is the greatest person. He cannot afford to lose you.\nThe ego exists in you but is possessed by others. It is the subtlest slavery yet invented by the priests and the politicians. It is like a Delgado electrode inserted in your head and manipulated by remote control.\nThe society is very clever. First, it tries to keep you at the second level. If you go beyond that, then it starts manipulating you through flattery.\nYou will be surprised that in India there has never been a revolution. And the reason? The reason is that the BRAHMIN, the intellectual, was so much flattered down the ages that he was never angry enough to revolt against the society. And only intellectuals revolt – only intellectuals, because they are the most egoistic people. They are the most independent people – the intelligentsia. And because in India the BRAHMIN was the highest... There was no one higher than him – even the\nking was lower than the BRAHMIN. A beggar BRAHMIN was higher than the emperor, and the emperor used to touch his feet. Now there was no possibility of revolution because who would do the revolution? These are the people, these intellectuals, who create trouble. Now they are respected highly, they are flattered highly... The revolution could not exist – it was not possible.\nIt has been the same thing in Soviet Russia. For these fifty years in Soviet society, the intellectual has been praised as much as anything. The academician, the writer, the poet, the professor – they are the most highly respected persons. Now who is going to do the revolution? Revolution is not possible, because the revolutionary has much investment in the conventional mode of the society, in the traditional society.\nIn India revolution didn’t happen, and in Russia it cannot happen. Revolution is possible only through the egoist. But the egoist can be manipulated very easily. Give him the Nobel Prize, give him a doctorate, and he is ready to do anything.\nThis third state of mind is now prevalent all over the world. If it is satisfied, then you are stuck in it. If it is not satisfied, then you fall back and become mad. Both are not healthy situations.\nOne has to go beyond it, and the fourth state, the universal mind, has to be created. The separation with the cosmos has to disappear. You have to become one with the whole. In fact you ARE one, you just think that you are not. That barrier of the thought has to be dissolved. Then there is relaxation, peace, non-violence. In India we say: SATYAM, SHIVAM, SUNDERAM: Then there is truth, there is good, and there is beauty. With the universal mind these three things flower: SATYAM – truth, SHIVAM – good, SUNDERAM – beauty. With the universal mind these three flowers come into bloom, and there is great joy. You have disappeared, and all the energy that was involved in the ego is freed. That energy becomes beauty, good, truth.\nThis is the state of matriarchy. The collective mind is patriarchy; the individual mind is fraternity; and the universal mind is matriarchy. Mother love is non-demanding, so is the love of the universe towards you. It demands nothing, it is unconditional, it is simply showering on you. It is for you to take or not to take, but it is showering on you. If you have the ego then your doors are closed and you don’t take it. If the ego has disappeared, then it goes on and on showering on you, goes on nourishing you, goes on fulfilling you.\nThe first stage was chaotic, the second was intellectual, the third was intelligent. The fourth is emotional: it is of love, of the heart. With the third, intellect comes to its peak; with the fourth, love starts flowing.\nThis state can be called ‘God as mother’. When God as father has died, God as mother has to arise. This is a higher stage of religion. When father is important, the religion is more institutional, formal – because father himself is formal, institutional. Mother is more natural, more biological, more intrinsic. Father is external, mother is internal.\nThe universal mind brings the matriarchy. Mother becomes more important. God is no more a he, but becomes a she. Life is thought about, not according to logic, but according to love.\nThe poet Schiller has called it ‘the universal kiss’. If you are available, the universal mother can kiss you, can embrace you, can take you again into her womb. Yes comes again into existence, but it is\nno more imposed from the outside, it comes from your innermost core. This is trust. The collective mind lives in faith. The individual mind lives in doubt, the universal mind lives in trust – SHRADDHA. It is not belief, it is not that somebody has forced you to believe; it is your own vision, it is your own experience.\nThis is true religion: when you can become a witness of God, of SAMADHI, of prayer; when you are the witness; when you have not taken it as borrowed – it is no more knowledge, no more belief – it has become your own existential experience. Solidarity again enters, but it is solidarity with existence itself, not with society. Creativity again comes, but it is no more the egoistic creativity. It is not you as doer – you become instrumental – God is the doer. Then God flows through you. You may create great poetry. In fact, you cannot create great poetry before it. The ego will create a shadow, the ego can never be transparent. The real creativity is possible only with the universal.\nYou must have read Gopi Krishna’s books on kundalini. He says that when kundalini arises, great creativity arises. That’s true. But whatsoever he gives as examples are not true. He says Sri Aurobindo became creative when his kundalini arose. But Sri Aurobindo has written poetry which is simply mediocre. Although it is not creative, at least it is mediocre. But Gopi Krishna has written poetry which cannot even be called mediocre – just rubbish, junk.\nYes, when you come to the universal, great creativity is born. Your very touch becomes creative. There is an ancient story in Buddhist scriptures...\nA very rich man accumulated much wealth – accumulated so much gold that there was no place to hoard it any more. But suddenly something happened. One morning he woke up and saw that all his gold had turned into dust. You can think he must have gone mad.\nSomebody helped him towards Buddha – Buddha was staying in the town – and the man went there. And Buddha said ‘You do one thing. Take all your gold into the market-place, and if somebody recognises it as gold, bring that man to me.’\nBut he said ‘How is it going to help me?’ Buddha said ‘It is going to help you Go.’\nSo he took all his gold – thousands of bullock-carts of dust, because now it was all dust. The whole market was full of his bullock-carts. And people were coming and asking ‘What nonsense is this? Why are you carrying so much dust to the market-place? For what?’\nBut the man kept quiet.\nThen a woman came. Her name was Kisagautami. And she said to this man ‘So much gold? From where could you get so much gold?’\nHe asked the woman ‘Can you see the gold here?’\nShe said ‘Oh yes. These thousand bullock-carts are full of gold.’\nHe took hold of the woman and asked her what secret she had. ‘How can she see? because nobody... not even I can see that there is any gold; it is all dust.’\nHe took the woman to Buddha, and Buddha said ‘You have found the right woman – she will teach you the art. It is only a question of seeing. The world is as you see it. It can be hell, it can be heaven. Gold can be dust, and dust can be gold. It is a question of how you look at it. This is the right woman. You become a disciple of Kisagautami. She will teach you. And the day you know how to see rightly, the whole world turns into gold. That is the secret of alchemy.’\nThat Kisagautami was a rare woman of those days. And the man learnt through her the art of turning the whole world into gold.\nWhen you enter the universal mind you are capable of creativity – not as you, but as God. You become a hollow bamboo and his song starts descending through you. He turns you into a flute.\nIf from the third, the fourth is not available you will fall into madness. Nietzsche talks only of three minds: the camel, the lion and the child. From the lion he falls back into the child: becomes mad.\nThere is another door too, and that is the universal mind – which is really childhood again, but a second childhood. It is no more like the first; it is not chaotic, it has a self-discipline. It has an inner cosmos, an inner order – not irresponsible like the first, not responsible like the second. A new responsibility, not towards any values, not towards any society, but a second kind of valuation arises because you can see what is right – how can you do otherwise? You see the right and the right has to be done. Knowledge here becomes virtue. You act according to your awareness; your life is transformed. There is innocence, there is intelligence, there is love, but all is coming from your innermost core; your inner fountain is flowing.\nAnd then the fifth, the last, when you go even beyond the universal. Because even to think that it is the universal mind is to think. You have some ideas of the individual and the universe still left lingering somewhere. You are still conscious that you are one with the whole, but you ARE, and you ARE one with the whole. The unity is not yet total, is not utter, is not ultimate. When the unity is really ultimate, there is no individual, no universal. This is the fifth mind: Christ-mind, Buddha-mind.\nNow three other characteristics appear: SATCHITANANDA. SAT means being, THAT means consciousness, ANANDA means bliss. Now these three qualities appear, now these new flowers bloom in your being. You are for the first time a being, becoming is no more. Man has surpassed himself, the bridge is no more. You have come home, you are a being: SAT. And you are utterly conscious because there is no darkness left: CHIT. And you are ANANDA, because there is no anxiety, no tension, no misery. All that is gone; the nightmare is over. You are fully awake. In that wakefulness is Buddha-hood, or Christhood.\nThese are the five stages. And remember, the third is the central. Two are below it, two are above it. If you don’t go above you will fall below. And you cannot go above without passing through the third, remember. These are the complexities. If you try to avoid the third you will remain stuck in the second, and you can think that it is universal. It is not, it is simply collective. If you try to avoid the third, you may even remain in the first, which is idiotic. And sometimes the idiotic.looks saintly.\nIn Hindi we have two words from one root for both the stages, that root IS BUDH. The fifth we call BUDDHA, the ultimate stage, and the first we call BUDDHU, the idiotic stage. Sometimes the idiot looks like the saint – he has some similarities, and sometimes the saint looks like the idiot. But they are far away – the farthest points in existence. Jesus sometimes looks idiotic. And there have been many idiots who looked like Jesus. The similarity is that both are without mind. The idiot is below mind and the Christ is above mind, but both are beyond mind. That is the similarity, but that is where it ends too. Beyond that nothing is similar.\nRemember, the first is not the goal, it is the beginning. The second is very comfortable, but comfort is not the question – creativity. The third is creative but very uncomfortable, very anxious, tense. And how long can you remain creative? – there is so much tension. The tension has to be lost; hence, the fourth. In the fourth all is silent. Just the last lingering of the ego has remained, that one feels ‘I am one with the whole.’\nA disciple of Rinzai came to the Master and said ‘I have become one with the whole! Now what next?’\nThe Master turned him out and told him ‘Now you get rid of this idea that you have become one with the whole. Get rid of this idea – this is the last barrier.’\nAnother disciple said to Rinzai ‘I have attained to nothing.’ And Rinzai said ‘Drop it. Drop that too!’\nWith the fourth just a very thin wall-almost transparent, you cannot see it – remains. That also has to be dropped. Then arises the fifth.\nThese sutras of Jesus are for the fifth.\nAND WHEN THOU PRAYEST, THOU SHALT NOT BE AS THE HYPOCRITES ARE: FOR THEY LOVE TO PRAY STANDING IN THE SYNAGOGUES AND IN THE CORNERS OF THE STREETS, THAT THEY MAY BE SEEN OF MEN. VERILY I SAY UNTO YOU, THEY HAVE THEIR REWARD.\nAnd Jesus says: Don’t be a hypocrite. Don’t pray just to show others that you are praying. That creates the collective mind. You are always looking at others – what they think about you. You are asking for respectability.\nThe hypocrite is one who lives for respectability. Whatsoever gives respect to him, he goes on doing; whether he wants to do it or not is not the point. He may even be against it. He may want to do just the opposite, but he goes on fulfilling the desire of the people because he needs their respect.\nJesus says\nAND WHEN THOU PRAYEST, THOU SHALT NOT BE AS THE HYPOCRITES ARE...\nAt least when you pray, forget the society, the collective mind. At least when you pray, forget formalities. Pray only for God, not for anybody else.\nVERILY I SAY UNTO YOU, THEY HAVE THEIR REWARD.\nAnd if you pray only just to show others that you are a great prayer, then that is your reward – the respect that you will get will be all that you get. That is not of any worth.\nBUT THOU, WHEN THOU PRAYEST, ENTER INTO THY CLOSET, AND WHEN THOU HAST SHUT THY DOOR, PRAY TO THY FATHER IN SECRET.\nJesus says: Pray in secret, pray in privacy. Pray outside the collective mind. Forget the society and the church and the people – forget all. Because when you forget all, only then can you remember God, not otherwise. In secret, in privacy, let your prayer be.\nBUT WHEN YE PRAY, USE NOT VAIN REPETITIONS, AS THE HEATHEN DO: FOR THEY THINK THAT THEY SHALL BE HEARD FOR THEIR MUCH SPEAKING.\nAnd Jesus says: It is not a question of repeating any formal prayer, the real question is of the heart – not what you say, but what you mean. It should not be formal; a formal thing becomes dead. It should be alive, authentic, pulsating. It should show your heart, and this moment where you are – it should represent it. It should be true and real. And don’t be worried, Jesus says, that you have to talk much to God. The only way to talk with him is in silence.\nBE NOT YE THEREFORE LIKE UNTO THEM: FOR YOUR FATHER KNOWETH WHAT THINGS YE HAVE NEED OF BEFORE YE ASK HIM.\nThere is no need to say anything. Just bowing down in silence will do. Just becoming utterly quiet will do. Silence is the language for prayer. But it may be difficult to go into silence directly, because all that we know is language.\nSo Jesus says, then\nAFTER THIS MANNER THEREFORE PRAY YE...\nIf it is very difficult to be silent, to be utterly silent, then start in this manner. Remember, Jesus says: AFTER THIS MANNER... not ‘exactly like this.’ Find your own way, create your own prayer. At least create your own prayer if you cannot create anything else.\n... THEREFORE PRAY YE: OUR FATHER WHICH ART IN HEAVEN,\nHALLOWED BE THY NAME. THY KINGDOM COME. THY WILL BE DONE IN EARTH, AS IT IS IN HEAVEN. GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD. AND FORGIVE US OUR DEBTS, AS WE FORGIVE OUR DEBTORS. AND LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION, BUT DELIVER US FROM EVIL: FOR THINE IS THE KINGDOM, AND THE POWER, AND THE GLORY, FOR EVER.\nAMEN.\nJesus says: AFTER THIS MANNER... He IS JUST giving you an example, he is not giving you a prayer, remember, he is simply saying ‘In this way...’ just to show you a way. Then you create your own prayer.\nThe whole point is that you should be surrendered, that you should be full of gratitude, praise, that you should be ready to receive... open, listening. That you should be silent... IN SECRET, in privacy. Your love has to be poured out at his feet. AFTER THIS MANNER... Find out your own prayer, create your own prayer. Let it be your own. A borrowed prayer is a false prayer.\nGIVE NOT THAT WHICH IS HOLY UNTO THE DOGS, NEITHER CAST YE YOUR PEARLS BEFORE SWINE, LEST THEY TRAMPLE THEM UNDER THEIR FEET, AND TURN AGAIN AND REND YOU.\nJesus says: You need not pray in the market-place, you need not pray just to show others that you are praying. That will be wrong, that will be like giving THAT WHICH IS HOLY UNTO THE DOGS. People who don’t understand prayer, if you pray there, you will be misunderstood.\n... NEITHER CAST YE YOUR PEARLS BEFORE SWINE...\nThese pearls of your heart should not be thrown before the swine.\n... LEST THEY TRAMPLE THEM UNDER THEIR FEET AND TURN AGAIN AND REND YOU. ASK, AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN YOU...\nJust ask your God, just let your prayer be for him, absolutely for him.\nASK, AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN YOU; SEEK, AND YE SHALL FIND; KNOCK, AND IT SHALL BE OPENED UNTO YOU.\nGod is always ready. It is not that only you are searching for him, he is also searching for you. KNOCK, AND IT SHALL BE OPENED UNTO YOU... He has been waiting there a long time for you. Man’s search is not one-sided. From the other side there is as much longing to meet – that is the meaning of this message.\nASK, AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN... SEEK, AND YE SHALL FIND; KNOCK, AND IT SHALL BE OPENED UNTO YOU: FOR EVERY ONE THAT ASKETH RECEIVETH; AND HE THAT SEEKETH FINDETH; AND TO HIM THAT KNOCKETH IT SHALL BE OPENED.\nTHEREFORE ALL THINGS WHATSOEVER YE WOULD THAT MEN SHOULD DO TO YOU, DO YE EVEN SO TO THEM: FOR THIS IS THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS.\nPray in secret... Prayer should be just an address between you and your God, a dialogue. And then your behaviour... and Jesus has completed the whole sketch for the religious life.\nWith people, do only that which you would like them to do to you. That is all! In short, the whole message of the law and the prophets: Do unto others what you would like them to do to you. That should be your behaviour. and that is enough preparation for prayer. And then, close your doors, go in secret and pray to your God.\nIf you have not done anything wrong to people, then there is nothing blocking your path. If nobody is angry, if nobody is against you, if you have not been hurting anybody – you are ready. Your prayer is going to be heard. Then let your prayer be your own, authentic, informal.\nENTER YE IN AT THE STRAIT GATE: FOR WIDE IS THE GATE, AND BROAD IS THE WAY, THAT LEADETH TO DEHYDRATION, AND MANY THERE BE WHICH GO IN THEREAT: BECAUSE STRAIT IS THE GATE, AND NARROW IS THE WAY, WHICH LEADETH UNTO LIFE, AND FEW THERE BE THAT FIND IT.\nJesus says: There are two gates. One is that of the crowd, the collective mind, and another is of the universal mind. Both are in one way similar – they are both gates. The difference is\n... FOR WIDE IS THE GATE, AND BROAD IS THE WAY, THAT LEADETH TO DESTRUCTION...\nBut where crowds move, naturally, the gate is wide, and the way is broad. Multitudes move there. But the real gate is narrow, only you alone can move there. They are both gates – the collective and the universal look alike – but in the collective you are just part of the mass, in the universal you are not part of the mass. Before the universal you have attained to a certain freedom, ego, individuality, self-definition – you move alone.\nBECAUSE STRAIT IS THE GATE, AND NARROW IS THE WAY, WHICH LEADETH UNTO LIFE, AND FEW THERE BE THAT FIND IT.\nThis thing is to be remembered: You can enter into God only in your absolute aloneness. You cannot take even your friend with you, not even your beloved. One has to go alone. The gate is very narrow. You cannot go as a Hindu, you cannot take Hindus with you. You cannot go as a Christian, you cannot go as part of the Christian mob. You will have to go as an individual. And to have an individuality you will have to develop the third mind. Only from the third can you enter the fourth. And from the fourth, slowly slowly, the fifth comes on its own. It grows, it opens like a lotus.\nThese are the five stages of the mind. Watch, observe. The first exists in everybody, the second also in ninety-nine per cent of people, the third in very few – three, four, five percent at the most, the fourth not even in one per cent, and the fifth is very rare.\nOnly once is a Christ born or a Buddha. But the fifth is the goal. Keep the goal in your vision, and go on moving, slowly slowly, from the first to the second, from the second to the third, from the third to the fourth.\nMan is a becoming. With the fifth mind arising, Buddha-mind, Christ-mind, man becomes a being. Then man is no more man, because man is no more mind. Then man is God. And only that can be fulfilling – nothing else. And never be satisfied by anything less.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"10264","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/i_say_unto_you_vol_1/part5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/i_say_unto_you_vol_1/>I Say Unto You, Vol 1</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">5 Pray to Thy Father in Secret</h1><div class=post-meta>49 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;10264 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/I_Say_Unto_You_Vol_1/part5.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

AND WHEN THOU PRAYEST, THOU SHALT NOT BE AS THE HYPOCRITES ARE:
FOR THEY LOVE TO PRAY STANDING IN THE SYNAGOGUES AND IN THE CORNERS OF
THE STREETS, THAT THEY MAY BE SEEN OF MEN. VERILY I SAY UNTO YOU, THEY
HAVE THEIR REWARD.</p><p><br></p><p>6. BUT THOU, WHEN THOU PRAYEST, ENTER INTO THY CLOSET, AND WHEN THOU
HAST SHUT THY DOOR, PRAY TO THY FATHER IN SECRET.</p><p><br></p><p>7. BUT WHEN YE PRAY, USE NOT VAIN REPETITIONS, AS THE HEATHEN DO: FOR
THEY THINK THAT THEY SHALL BE HEARD FOR THEIR MUCH SPEAKING.</p><p><br></p><p>8. BE NOT THEREFORE LIKE UNTO THEM: FOR YOUR FATHER KNOWETH WHAT
THINGS YE HAVE NEED OF, BEFORE YE ASK HIM.</p><p><br></p><p>9. AFTER THIS MANNER THEREFORE PRAY YE: OUR FATHER WHICH ART IN
HEAVEN, HALLOWED BE THY NAME.</p><p><br></p><p>10. THY KINGDOM COME. THY WILL BE DONE IN EARTH, AS IT IS IN
HEAVEN.</p><p><br></p><p>11. GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD.</p><p>12. AND FORGIVE US OUR DEBTS, AS WE FORGIVE OUR DEBTORS.</p><p><br></p><p>13. AND LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION, BUT DELIVER US FROM EVIL: FOR
THINE IS THE KINGDOM, AND THE POWER, AND THE GLORY, FOR EVER.</p><p><br></p><p>AMEN.</p><p><br></p><p>MATTHEW 7</p><p><br></p><p>6. GIVE NOT THAT WHICH IS HOLY UNTO THE DOGS, NEITHER CAST YE YOUR
PEARLS BEFORE SWINE, LEST THEY TRAMPLE THEM UNDER THEIR FEET, AND TURN
AGAIN AND REND YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>7. ASK, AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN YOU; SEEK, AND YE SHALL FIND; KNOCK,
AND IT SHALL BE OPENED UNTO YOU:</p><p><br></p><p>8. FOR EVERY ONE THAT ASKETH RECEIVETH; AND HE THAT SEEKETH FINDETH;
AND TO HIM THAT KNOCKETH IT SHALL BE OPENED.</p><p><br></p><p>12. THEREFORE ALL THINGS WHATSOEVER YE WOULD THAT MEN SHOULD DO TO
YOU, DO YE EVEN SO TO THEM: FOR THIS IS THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS.</p><p><br></p><p>13. ENTER YE IN AT THE STRAIT GATE: FOR WIDE IS THE GATE, AND BROAD
IS THE WAY, THAT LEADETH TO DESTRUCTION, AND MANY THERE BE WHICH GO IN
THEREAT:</p><p><br></p><p>14. BECAUSE STRAIT IS THE GATE, AND NARROW IS THE WAY, WHICH LEADETH
UNTO LIFE, AND FEW THERE BE THAT FIND IT.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is mind.</p><p><br></p><p>The word ‘man’ itself comes from the Sanskrit root man, which means
mind. If you understand the workings of the mind, you will understand
the reality of man and the possibility too. If you understand the inner
mechanism of the mind, you will understand the past of man, the present
and the future too.</p><p><br></p><p>Man in himself is not a being but a passage. In himself man is not a
being, because man is continuously a becoming. There is no rest in being
a man. Rest is below man or above man. Below is nature, above is God.
Man is just in between – a link, a ladder. You cannot rest on a ladder,
you cannot stop on the ladder. The ladder cannot become your abode. Man
has to be surpassed, man has to be transcended.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is a journey between your two infinities. One is your nature, one
infinity; another is your hidden God, the other infinity. And man is
just between the two, a ferry boat. Use it, but don’t be confined by it.
Use it, but don’t be defined by it. Always remember that you have to go
beyond.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole message of Jesus is how to go beyond man. That’s why he
again and again says: I am the Son of man and the Son of God. He goes on
insisting on this contradiction, because he wants</p><p>it to be completely clear that man is both: on the one hand part of
nature, on the other hand part of God. That is the meaning of the word
‘son’: son means a part of the father.</p><p><br></p><p>And because man belongs to these two realities – two separate
realities – there is anxiety in mall, there is tension in man, there is
constant conflict in man, because these two natures go on fighting.
Hence, as man, there is no possibility of peace. Either you have to
become absolutely unconscious, like a drunkard when he has taken so much
alcohol that he has lost all his consciousness – then there is peace, or
you will have to become so conscious that all the nooks and corners of
your being are full of light – you become a Buddha or a Christ – then
there is peace. Either fall below man, or go beyond man. Don’t go on
clinging to being a man, because then you are clinging to a disease.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s exactly what man is: a disease, a constant tension – to be or
not to be, to be this or to be that – a constant fight between the soul
and the body, the lower and the higher, unconsciousness and
consciousness. To understand man as a conflict, to understand man as a
constant tension will help immensely, because then you stop clinging to
man as such. Rather, on the contrary, you start thinking ‘How to go
beyond, how to transcend, how to surpass?’</p><p><br></p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche is right when he says that mall is the only
animal who tries to surpass himself, the only animal who can surpass
himself. It is the greatest miracle in the world: to surpass oneself.
But it has happened. It has happened in a Christ, in a Buddha, in a
Krishna. It can happen in you! You are a great promise, a project, an
adventure. But don’t start thinking about yourself as if you have
arrived. Then you cling somewhere in between, and a part of you will be
pulled to one side and the other part to another side – you will be torn
apart. And you will remain in anguish, and your existence will be
nothing but a long long on-going nightmare.</p><p><br></p><p>Before we enter the sutras, a few things about the mind – because man
is mind.</p><p><br></p><p>The first state of mind we can call ‘pre-mind’. It exists in a very
small child – very primitive, animal- like. Hence the beauty of the
children, and the innocence, and the grace – because that anxiety which
we call man has not yet evolved. The child is at ease. The child is not
yet a traveller, he has yet not left his home in search for some other
home. The pilgrimage has not started yet. The child is at rest –
perfectly at ease and happy to be whatsoever he is. That’s why his eyes
have no anxiety, and the child has a certain grace around him.</p><p><br></p><p>But this grace is going to be lost. This grace cannot stay forever,
because it is unconscious, because it has not been earned, because it is
a natural gift, and the child is completely oblivious to it. He cannot
hold onto it. How can you hold onto something when you are unconscious
of it? It has to be lost. The only way to gain it is to lose it. The
child will have to go into corruption, into perversion. The child will
have to go into the cunningness of the mind, and then the child will
understand that he has lost something – something immensely
valuable.</p><p><br></p><p>But one can know it only when it is lost. There is no other way to
know it. Then the search starts. Religion is nothing but the search for
the lost childhood. Everybody carries the memory of it, the very alive
memory of it, somewhere deep down. Maybe not very consciously, but it
functions like an unconscious substratum that something has been lost,
something has been forgotten, something was there which is no more
there; something is being missed, and one starts searching for it.</p><p>The first stage is pre-mind. There is no responsibility, because a
child knows nothing of duty, the child knows nothing of values, virtues.
The child knows nothing of sainthood, so he is not aware of sin either.
He exists before the diversion, he exists before those two paths of sin
and sainthood diverge, separate and go apart. He is in a kind of
primitive unity. This cannot last for long, this is going to go, but it
has not gone yet. This is the state of the child nearabout three years
of age.</p><p><br></p><p>Between three and four the child loses his innocence, loses his
virginity, loses nature and becomes part of the civilised world – really
becomes man.</p><p><br></p><p>This pre-mind is instinctive. It is very intelligent, but the
intelligence is not intellectual, the intelligence is purely
instinctive. The child functions very intelligently but not
intellectually. The intelligence that a child shows is natural, he has
not learned it. It is part of the wisdom of his body, it is
inherited.</p><p><br></p><p>The child has no idea of good and bad, so there is never any
conflict. His desires are pure. Whatsoever he desires, he desires
passionately, totally. No problem arises in his mind whether this desire
is right or wrong. Whenever he is in a certain mood, he is totally in it
– but his moods are momentary. He has no identity, he is unpredictable:
one moment he is loving, another moment he is angry. And you cannot tell
him ‘You are contradictory’; he is very inconsistent because he is
always true to the moment. Not that he does anything consciously, it is
just natural.</p><p><br></p><p>So the innocence is there, but it is not very deep. The innocence is
there, but it has no meditativeness in it. It is shallow, momentary,
temporary, tentative.</p><p><br></p><p>The child is more like an animal than like a man. The child is the
link between the man and the animal. The child passes through all the
stages that man has passed through down the ages. The scientists say
that during nine months in the mother’s womb the child passes through
millions of years of evolution. He starts like a fish – as life started
on the earth – and then by and by, he goes on growing. Within days he is
passing through thousands, millions of years; in nine months he has
passed through the whole of evolution. But even when the child is born,
he is still not yet man – not at least, civilised – he is primitive, the
cave-man.</p><p><br></p><p>The child lives in an inner chaos. He has no idea what he is going to
do. He has no future, he carries no past; he lives utterlY in the
present. But because he lives utterly in the present and unconsciously,
his life cannot have a discipline, an order. It is chaotic, it is
anarchic. This is the first stage of man, the first stage of mind. And
remember, that although sooner or later you lose it, it remains like a
substratum in you. You can lose it totally only when meditation has gone
deep, when meditation has transformed your being. Otherwise it remains
there, and you can fall into it at any moment; in any stress, in any
strain you can again become childish.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, your house is on fire, and you can start crying like a
child. And you are not a man who cries ordinarily – nobody may have ever
seen you crying. And your house is on fire and suddenly you forget that
you are a grown-up man. You become like a small child, you start crying
– tears come to your eyes – yoU are completely lost, helpless. What has
happened? That pre-mind has reclaimed you. It was always there. You had
grown a second layer upon it, on top of it, but it was there deep down.
When the second layer cannot function. in a deep helplessness you fall
to the first layer. This happens every day.</p><p>In anger you become more childish, in love also you become more
childish. Listen to the dialogue of two lovers, and you will find it
very childish. Remember your own memories when you first fell in love:
how you behaved, what you said to your beloved or your lover, and you
will find childishness. Or remember when somebody provokes you and you
become angry – you start doing things which are very illogical,
unintelligent. undisciplined, chaotic. You repent for them later on,
because later on, when the second layer comes back, the second layer
repents for the first layer. When the civilized mind comes back, takes
hold again, it repents. It says ‘It was not good of me. It was not good
to do.’</p><p><br></p><p>The first layer never completely goes unless you become a Christ or a
Buddha. It remains there. Watch it.</p><p><br></p><p>The first layer is very chaotic. The second layer is collective. The
second mind I call the ‘collective mind’. Now the group, the family, the
society, the nation become more important than yourself. A child is very
very self-oriented, he thinks only of himself. He does not care for
anything else, he is utterly selfish. The second mind starts thinking of
others, starts sacrificing its own interests, becomes more collective,
becomes more part of society, a clan, a tribe – starts becoming
civilised. Civilisation means to become part of a society, to become
part of many people: to become responsible, not to go on living a
selfish existence. Civilisation means sacrificing oneself for
others.</p><p><br></p><p>This second mind is very prevalent. Except in very rare cases, the
first mind sooner or later disappears. Some imbeciles, idiots – in them
the first layer never disappears, it remains predominant. They never
learn how to be social, they remain primitive. Otherwise, normally the
second layer evolves – the schooling, the family training, the teachers,
the Society, the experiences, the observation... And the child starts
learning that he is not an island, but a member of an organism – the
society, the church, the nation.</p><p><br></p><p>This second, collective mind has a certain identity. The first mind
knows no identity. If you ask a child ‘Who are you?’ he can’t answer it.
He does not know the answer – who he is. But a grown-up person can say
‘Yes, I am a Catholic, I am a communist, I am a Hindu, I am an Indian, I
am a German, I am an Italian.’ What is he saying? He is saying ‘I belong
to this group called Hindu, or Christian, or Mohammedan. I belong to
this nation, to this geography – India, Germany. Italy.’ Or ‘I belong to
this ideology – communism, Catholicism, fascism.’He is saying ’I am to
whom I belong’.</p><p><br></p><p>Now he has an identity. He can say ‘I am a doctor, or an engineer, or
a businessman’ – then too he is saying ‘This is what I do. This is my
function in the society.’ When you ask somebody ‘Who are you?’ – he
answers by showing you where he belongs, to whom he belongs, what his
function is in the society. Now this is not much of a self-knowledge. If
this is self-knowledge then everybody knows who he is. But for
utilitarian purposes it is enough, and many people stop there.</p><p><br></p><p>If you stop there you will never know who you are. Then you have
taken just a false identity. Just a few labels, and you think ‘This is
me’. This is not you. You exist on a far higher plane, or in a deeper
depth. These labels that you have collected about yourself are good for
functioning in the society as a member, but they don’t show anything
about your reality. The inward reality remains untouched by them. But
this is the second layer where almost everybody stops. The society does
not want you to go beyond it. The school, the college, the university –
their effort is that you should not remain childish, you should become
civilised, and then their effort ends. Then the society’s work is
finished.</p><p>The society has made you a member of the mass, has made you a kind of
slave, has given you a certain imprisonment, has taken all that was
dangerous in you – the chaos, the freedom, the irresponsibility; has
made you dutiful, responsible, given you values what is good and what is
not good; has pigeonholed you, categorised you. Now the society is
finished. Now live silently, go to the office, come home, take care of
your children, your parents, and so on and so forth – one day, die: your
existence is complete. This is a very false completion: a routine
existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche has called this state ‘the camel’, the beast of
burden. This is the ‘camel state’. People go on carrying great loads and
burdens for no reason at all. And they go on moving in a desert, like
the camel moves in a desert. You can see these camels all around dry,
dull, dead, still carrying, carrying great loads. The loads are crushing
them, killing them, but they are carrying – maybe just out of habit.
Because yesterday also they were carrying and the day before yesterday
also they were carrying; it has become part of their habit, it has
become part of their definition. Their load, their anxiety, their
sadness, their misery have become part of their definition, their
identity. These camels you will find everywhere, and this desert is all
over the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>The child has to come from the first to the second, but nobody should
stop there. To be a camel is not the goal. Something more is needed,
something more existential is needed. Yes, you will have respectability
if you are a good camel and carry great loads. People will respect you,
they will all show honour towards you. That’s a kind of mutual
understanding. When a person is Carrying so much load, he has to be
given some awards – that’s what respect is.</p><p><br></p><p>The word ‘respect’ is beautiful, it means to look again: respect.
When a person is carrying a great load of responsibility, duty, family,
society, people look at him and say ‘Look, what a great man!’ Re-spect:
they look again and again and they say ‘Look! How much of a burden he is
carrying. What sacrifice!’ He has sacrificed his whole being.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally if you sacrifice yourself for the religion, the religion
will sanctify you, will call you a saint. If you sacrifice for the
country, the country will give you respect. If you sacrifice for
something else, they will give you respect. One can go on collecting
this respect, and one can go on dying without living at all. Beware of
this situation!</p><p><br></p><p>In this state, there is a collective responsibility: the collective
mind functions; you don’t have a personal responsibility yet. The child
has no responsibility. The second stage has a responsibility, hut it is
collective. You don’t feel PERSONALLY responsible for anything, you feel
responsible only because you are part of a certain collectivity.</p><p><br></p><p>In an Indian village you can find this state the camel very very
pronounced. A BRAHMIN has no responsibility of his own. His whole
responsibility is that he is a BRAHMIN, he has to behave like a brahmin.
In Indian villages you will not find individualities, you will only find
collectivities. The BRAHMIN, the SHUDRA, the KSHATRIYA – they all
function according to their community, according to the rules. Nobody
has any responsibility to think, there is no question of thinking. The
rules have been given down the ages, they are written in the scriptures.
Everything is clear-cut – there is no need to speculate, to
philosophise, to ponder, to meditate. All problems have been solved –
Manu, the Indian Moses, has solved them.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s where Jesus found the Jews – at the second stage. Moses had
done the first work, he had brought the primitive mind to a civilised
state. Now Jesus was needed to bring another revolution,</p><p>another transformation. People were existing just as cogs in a wheel,
parts of a great mechanism. The only question was how to function
efficiently.</p><p><br></p><p>That is not enough to live a joyous life. To be efficient is because
the efficiency makes you a good mechanism but does not give you a soul.
It does not give you a celebration, it can’t be ecstatic. But there are
a few beautiful things about the second mind you have to remember; they
will help you to understand the third.</p><p><br></p><p>The second mind is non-tense: there is no anxiety in it. The Indian
villager, or the people of the East are more calm, quiet. They move with
a certain ease, dignity. Even if they are starving, hungry, ill, they
have a patience, a deep accep-tance. They don’t rebel. Rebellion has no
appeal for them, they live in acceptance. They don’t have that much
individual-ity to rebel. Indians feel very good about it, they think
America is going mad; they think ‘We are fortunate.’ But this is not my
observation.</p><p><br></p><p>America is in a difficulty. America is in great anguish, but that
anguish is higher than the so-called Indian peace. That anguish can be
more creative, that anguish can bring a higher stage of mind and
consciousness into the world than this cow-like peace. This peace is not
very creative. Yes, it is good in a way – one lives one’s life without
much anguish. But nothing comes out of that life. Just peaceful and
peaceful, and that peace is never creative – creative of something out,
or creative of something in. That peace seems to be very impotent. But
in this second stage the peace is there, obedience is there, patience is
there, and there is a feeling of belonging to the community, to the
church. Nobody feels alone.</p><p><br></p><p>In America people are very alone. Even in a crowd they are alone. In
India, even if people are alone, they are not alone. They know they
belong, they know they have a certain function somewhere, they know they
are needed. They know that they need not choose, everything has been
chosen beforehand. A BRAHMIN is born a BRAHMIN. He will be respected by
the society, he will become the priest. He has not to work for it, it is
already decided by fate, by God.</p><p><br></p><p>When you don’t have to decide, naturally you don’t feel any anxiety.
Decision brings anxiety. You have to decide, then there is a problem.
Then to go this way or that? and there are a thousand ways, and so many
alternatives – and choose in trembling, because who knows whether you
are choosing the right or the wrong? The only way to know is to choose
it. But then it will be too late. After ten years if you come to know
that it was a wrong choice it will be too difficult to go back and
choose again, because then those ten years will be gone – gone down the
drain.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a kind of belonging in the second state of mind. You need
not choose, everything has been chosen, decided already; there is a kind
of fatalism. All that happens has to be accepted because it cannot be
otherwise. If it cannot be otherwise then why be worried? That’s why in
India there are less psychological breakdowns than in America. But it is
not a good state, remember. And I am not saying that a psychological
breakdown is a great thing, and I am not saying that to be tense and to
be anxious is something valuable. But I am saying that just not to be
anxious and not to be tense is not some achievement either.</p><p><br></p><p>This state – the second state – is a kind of patriarchy. The father
remains very important. The father-figures are very important. God is
thought to be a father.</p><p>There is a difference between the mother and the father. The father
is very demanding, the mother is non-demanding. Mother’s love is
unconditional, father’s love is conditional. The father says ‘Do this
then I will love you; if you don’t do this you will not get my love.’
And the father can get very angry.</p><p><br></p><p>This state is a state of patriarchy: father remains important, mother
is not important. Unconditional love is not known. Society appreciates
you, respects you if you follow the society. If you go a little bit
astray, all respect is taken away and the society is ready to destroy
you. The Jewish God says ‘I am a very jealous God. If you go against me
I will destroy you!’ – and that’s what the state says, the government
says, the priest says, the pope says. They are all very jealous. They
are very dominating.</p><p><br></p><p>This state is very repressive: it does not allow anybody to have his
own say, it does not allow anybody to have his own being. It is
repressive: it does not allow one’s own impulses. It is dictatorial: it
teaches you to say yes; no is not accepted, yes is enforced violently,
aggressively. Of course this yes cannot be of much value, because if you
cannot say no your yes is going to be impotent. But this is the yes that
exists all around. People believe in God because they have been told to
believe in God. People go to the church because they have been told to
go to the church. People go on doing things formally, ritualistically.
Jesus called these people hypocrites.</p><p><br></p><p>Before we enter into the sutras, these things will be good to
understand, then the sutras will be very very clear.</p><p><br></p><p>This state of mind has only a painted exterior, the interior remains
untouched, unevolved. A kind of theism – people believe in God, people
believe in hell and heaven, and people believe in punishment and reward
– but people believe, people don’t know. Yes is there, but it has been
forced. It has not been given a chance to evolve and unfold within you.
There is a communal solidarity because you are never alone, you are
always together with people, and the crowd is all around you and it
feels good. The moment you are alone, trembling arises. When the great
crowd is all around you, you can trust. So many people can’t be wrong,
so you must be right, because so many people are going in the same way,
in the same direction, and you are also going with them.</p><p><br></p><p>The third mind I call the ‘individual mind’; Nietzsche calls it ‘the
lion’. It is independence, it is assertion, it is rebellion. The ego has
evolved. The ego has become very very crystallised. The man is no more
just a part of a church, country, tribe, clan, family; he is himself.
The real culture can only start when you have become an individual. The
sense of the self is a must, and this is the third stage of the
mind.</p><p><br></p><p>The identity is no more of belonging, the identity is no more that
you are a Hindu, or a Mohammedan, or a Christian. The identity is more
personal – that you are a painter, that you are a poet. The identity is
more creative; it is not of belonging but of contribution – what you
have contributed to the world.</p><p><br></p><p>In the nebulous mind a centre arises by and by. In the child’s mind
there was no centre. In the collective mind there was a false centre
imposed from the outside. In the individual mind an inner centre arises.
The first was a kind of chaos – no order. The second was a kind of
patriarchy – an imposed order by the father, by the demanding society
and the father-figures. The third is a kind of fraternity: a brotherhood
arises. You don’t belong to any crowd; nobody can impose anything
upon</p><p>you, nor do you want to impose anything upon anybody. You respect
others’ freedom as much as you respect your own freedom. All are
brothers.</p><p><br></p><p>In the first, the basic question was ‘Who is the father-figure?’ In
the second, the question is not who is the father-figure – there is
none, God is dead. That is the situation in which Nietzsche declares
that God is dead: God, as father, is dead. That is the situation where
Buddha says there is no God, and Mahavir says there is no God. And
Patanjali says that God is just a hypothesis – needed in certain stages,
and then is needed no more.</p><p><br></p><p>Responsibility arises, and a very personal responsibility. You start
feeling responsible for each of your acts, because now you know what is
right and what is wrong. Not that somebody says ‘This is right’, but
because you feel this is right, because you feel this is good. A greater
understanding, a greater consciousness will be needed. There will be
more joy because you will be more crystallised, but there will be more
anxiety too, because now if something goes wrong you go wrong. And you
alone are responsible for each step. You cannot look to a father-figure,
and you cannot throw your responsibility onto somebody else – no fate,
no father exists, you are left alone on the road, with thousands of
alternatives. and you have to choose. And each choice is going to be
decisive, because you cannot go back in time. Great anxiety arises. This
is the place where people start having psychological breakdowns. This is
a higher stage than the second, and the West exists at a higher stage
than your so-called East. But of course there are problems. And those
problems can be solved, and those problems should be solved rather than
slipping back to a lower stage of mind.</p><p><br></p><p>There is freedom, so there is tension. There is thinking, there is
concentration – abstract philosophy is born, science grows, and no
becomes very important. Doubt becomes very significant. In the
collective mind faith was the rule; in the individual mind doubt becomes
the rule. No becomes very basic, because rebellion cannot exist without
no, and the ego cannot grow and ripen without no. You have to say no to
a thousand and one things, so that you can say yes to the one thing you
would like to say yes to. Now the yes is significant, because the man is
capable of saying no. Now the yes has a potency, power.</p><p><br></p><p>The man who always says yes – his yes is not of much worth. But the
man who says no ninety-nine times and says yes one time – he means it.
It has an authenticity.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a very creative crisis because if you go above it, it will be
creative. If you fall from it, you will not fall to the second, you will
fall to the first. This has to be understood. If you fall from the
third, the individual mind, you will go immediately into madness,
because the second is no more possible. You have learnt no-saying, you
have learnt being rebellious, you have tasted freedom, now you cannot
fall back to the second. That door no more exists for you. If you fall
from the third you will fall to the first: you will go mad.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s exactly what happened to Friedrich Nietzsche himself. He was a
‘lion’, but the lion went mad, roaring and roaring and roaring, and
could not find a Way beyond the third.</p><p><br></p><p>When a man falls from the third, he falls to the first. This has to
be remembered. Then you cannot go to the second – that is finished
forever. Once your no has become very conscious you cannot go back to
faith. A man who has doubted, and who has learnt to doubt, cannot go to
faith again – that is impossible. Now the faith will be simply
Cunningness and deception, and you cannot deceive</p><p>yourself. Once a man has become an atheist then ordinary theism won’t
do. Then he will have to find a man like me. Then ordinary theism won’t
do – he has gone beyond it.</p><p><br></p><p>Nietzsche needed a man like Buddha. And because Buddha was not
available, and because the Western mind has not yet been able to make it
possible for people to go beyond the third, he had to go mad. In the
West it is almost a certainty that whenever a person becomes really
evolved at the third stage, he starts slipping into madness, because the
fourth is not available there yet. If the fourth is available, then the
third is very creative. If there is a possibility to surrender the ego,
then the ego is of immense value. But the value is in its surrender! If
you cannot surrender it, then it will become a load – a great load on
you. It will be unbearable. Then the lion will go on roaring and roaring
and there will be no other way than to go mad.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a very critical stage – the third; it is just in the middle.
Two minds are below it and two minds are above it. It is exactly the
mid-link. If you fall, you go into the abyss of madness; if you rise,
you go into the beatitude of being a Christ or a Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth mind is ‘universal mind’. Remember, it looks collective
but it is not collective. ‘Collective’ means belonging to a society, a
certain time, a certain period, a certain country. ‘Universal’ means
belonging to the whole existence, to existence as such. The ego, when
ripe, can be dropped; in fact, drops itself if the fourth door is
available. And that is the function of religion: to make the fourth door
available. That is the problem in the .West now: the third mind has
developed to its uttermost, and the fourth door is not available. The
West URGENTLY needs the fourth door.</p><p><br></p><p>Carl Gustav Jung has said in his memoirs that through observing
thousands of people in his whole life, he has come to a few conclusions.
One conclusion is that people who are nearabout forty to forty-five are
always facing a religious crisis. Their problem is not psychological,
their problem is religious. Near the age of forty-two, forty-five, a man
starts looking for the fourth mind. If he cannot find it, then he goes
berserk. Then the hunger is there and the nourishment is not available.
If he can find it, great beatitude, great benediction arises.</p><p><br></p><p>It is almost like at the age of fourteen you become sexually mature.
Then you start looking for a partner – for a woman, for a man. You want
a love object – near the age of fourteen. Exactly near the age of
forty-two another thing in you matures, and you start looking for
SAMADHI, for meditation, for something that goes higher than love,
something that goes higher than sex, something that can lead to a more
eternal orgasm, more total orgasm. If you can find it then life remains
smooth. If you cannot find the door – hunger has arisen and the
nourishment is not available – what will you do? You start breaking
down: your whole structure is shaken. And when a man breaks down. he
always breaks down to the first; he falls to the lowest.</p><p><br></p><p>This fourth I call the ‘universal mind’ – the ego can be dissolved
because the ego has matured. Remember, let me repeat: the ego can be
dissolved only when it has become mature. I am not against the ego, I am
all for it – but I don’t confine myself to it. One has to go beyond
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I was reading Frankl’s book. He says ‘We must be
willing to discard personality.’ Why should we be willing to discard
personality? And how can you discard personality if you have not grown
it? Only the perfectly ripe can be discarded.</p><p>What is personality? Personality is a PERSONA, a mask. It is needed.
The child has no mask, that’s why he looks so animal-like. The
collective mind has a mask, but imposed from the outside; it has no
interior definition of its being. The egoist, the individual mind, has
an interior definition; he knows who he is, he has a kind of
integration. Of course, the integration is not ultimate and will have to
be dropped, but it can be dropped only when it has been attained.</p><p><br></p><p>‘We must be willing to discard personality. God is no respecter of
persons.’ That’s true. God loves individuals, but not persons. And the
difference is great. A person is one who has an ego definition. An
individual is one who has dropped his ego, and knows who he is. A person
is a circle with a centre; and the individual is a circle without the
centre – just pure space.</p><p><br></p><p>‘The personality is only a mask, it is a theatrical creation, a mere
stage-prop.’ The longing for freedom, salvation or NIRVANA, means simply
the wish to be relieved of your so-called personality and the prison
that it creates.</p><p><br></p><p>‘The trouble with the self is that it is derived from others.’ Your
ego is also derived from others. You depend for your ego on the others.
If you go to the Himalayas and sit in a cave, what ego will you have? By
and by the ego will start disappearing. It needs support. Somebody needs
to appreciate it. Somebody needs to say to you that you are a beautiful
person. Somebody needs to go on feeding it. The ego can exist only in
society. Although it tries to get rid of society, in a subtle,
unconscious way it remains dependent on the society.</p><p><br></p><p>‘The trouble with the self is that it is derived from others. It is
constructed in an attempt to live up to the expectation of others. The
others have become installed in our hearts, and we call them
ourselves.’</p><p><br></p><p>The self is not you. It belongs to others who surround you. It exists
in you, but it is possessed by others. That’s why it is so easy to
manipulate an egoistic person. That’s what flattery is: flattery is a
trick to manipulate the egoistic person. You go and say to him that he
is the greatest man in the world, and he is ready to fall at your feet;
you are manipulating. He knows, you know and everybody else knows that
this is just false. He also knows that he is not the greatest man in the
world, but he will believe it. He would like to believe it. And he would
like to do anything that you want him to do. At least one person in the
world believes that he is the greatest person. He cannot afford to lose
you.</p><p><br></p><p>The ego exists in you but is possessed by others. It is the subtlest
slavery yet invented by the priests and the politicians. It is like a
Delgado electrode inserted in your head and manipulated by remote
control.</p><p><br></p><p>The society is very clever. First, it tries to keep you at the second
level. If you go beyond that, then it starts manipulating you through
flattery.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised that in India there has never been a
revolution. And the reason? The reason is that the BRAHMIN, the
intellectual, was so much flattered down the ages that he was never
angry enough to revolt against the society. And only intellectuals
revolt – only intellectuals, because they are the most egoistic people.
They are the most independent people – the intelligentsia. And because
in India the BRAHMIN was the highest... There was no one higher than him
– even the</p><p>king was lower than the BRAHMIN. A beggar BRAHMIN was higher than the
emperor, and the emperor used to touch his feet. Now there was no
possibility of revolution because who would do the revolution? These are
the people, these intellectuals, who create trouble. Now they are
respected highly, they are flattered highly... The revolution could not
exist – it was not possible.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been the same thing in Soviet Russia. For these fifty years in
Soviet society, the intellectual has been praised as much as anything.
The academician, the writer, the poet, the professor – they are the most
highly respected persons. Now who is going to do the revolution?
Revolution is not possible, because the revolutionary has much
investment in the conventional mode of the society, in the traditional
society.</p><p><br></p><p>In India revolution didn’t happen, and in Russia it cannot happen.
Revolution is possible only through the egoist. But the egoist can be
manipulated very easily. Give him the Nobel Prize, give him a doctorate,
and he is ready to do anything.</p><p><br></p><p>This third state of mind is now prevalent all over the world. If it
is satisfied, then you are stuck in it. If it is not satisfied, then you
fall back and become mad. Both are not healthy situations.</p><p><br></p><p>One has to go beyond it, and the fourth state, the universal mind,
has to be created. The separation with the cosmos has to disappear. You
have to become one with the whole. In fact you ARE one, you just think
that you are not. That barrier of the thought has to be dissolved. Then
there is relaxation, peace, non-violence. In India we say: SATYAM,
SHIVAM, SUNDERAM: Then there is truth, there is good, and there is
beauty. With the universal mind these three things flower: SATYAM –
truth, SHIVAM – good, SUNDERAM – beauty. With the universal mind these
three flowers come into bloom, and there is great joy. You have
disappeared, and all the energy that was involved in the ego is freed.
That energy becomes beauty, good, truth.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the state of matriarchy. The collective mind is patriarchy;
the individual mind is fraternity; and the universal mind is matriarchy.
Mother love is non-demanding, so is the love of the universe towards
you. It demands nothing, it is unconditional, it is simply showering on
you. It is for you to take or not to take, but it is showering on you.
If you have the ego then your doors are closed and you don’t take it. If
the ego has disappeared, then it goes on and on showering on you, goes
on nourishing you, goes on fulfilling you.</p><p><br></p><p>The first stage was chaotic, the second was intellectual, the third
was intelligent. The fourth is emotional: it is of love, of the heart.
With the third, intellect comes to its peak; with the fourth, love
starts flowing.</p><p><br></p><p>This state can be called ‘God as mother’. When God as father has
died, God as mother has to arise. This is a higher stage of religion.
When father is important, the religion is more institutional, formal –
because father himself is formal, institutional. Mother is more natural,
more biological, more intrinsic. Father is external, mother is
internal.</p><p><br></p><p>The universal mind brings the matriarchy. Mother becomes more
important. God is no more a he, but becomes a she. Life is thought
about, not according to logic, but according to love.</p><p><br></p><p>The poet Schiller has called it ‘the universal kiss’. If you are
available, the universal mother can kiss you, can embrace you, can take
you again into her womb. Yes comes again into existence, but it is</p><p>no more imposed from the outside, it comes from your innermost core.
This is trust. The collective mind lives in faith. The individual mind
lives in doubt, the universal mind lives in trust – SHRADDHA. It is not
belief, it is not that somebody has forced you to believe; it is your
own vision, it is your own experience.</p><p><br></p><p>This is true religion: when you can become a witness of God, of
SAMADHI, of prayer; when you are the witness; when you have not taken it
as borrowed – it is no more knowledge, no more belief – it has become
your own existential experience. Solidarity again enters, but it is
solidarity with existence itself, not with society. Creativity again
comes, but it is no more the egoistic creativity. It is not you as doer
– you become instrumental – God is the doer. Then God flows through you.
You may create great poetry. In fact, you cannot create great poetry
before it. The ego will create a shadow, the ego can never be
transparent. The real creativity is possible only with the
universal.</p><p><br></p><p>You must have read Gopi Krishna’s books on kundalini. He says that
when kundalini arises, great creativity arises. That’s true. But
whatsoever he gives as examples are not true. He says Sri Aurobindo
became creative when his kundalini arose. But Sri Aurobindo has written
poetry which is simply mediocre. Although it is not creative, at least
it is mediocre. But Gopi Krishna has written poetry which cannot even be
called mediocre – just rubbish, junk.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, when you come to the universal, great creativity is born. Your
very touch becomes creative. There is an ancient story in Buddhist
scriptures...</p><p>A very rich man accumulated much wealth – accumulated so much gold
that there was no place to hoard it any more. But suddenly something
happened. One morning he woke up and saw that all his gold had turned
into dust. You can think he must have gone mad.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody helped him towards Buddha – Buddha was staying in the town –
and the man went there. And Buddha said ‘You do one thing. Take all your
gold into the market-place, and if somebody recognises it as gold, bring
that man to me.’</p><p><br></p><p>But he said ‘How is it going to help me?’ Buddha said ‘It is going to
help you Go.’</p><p>So he took all his gold – thousands of bullock-carts of dust, because
now it was all dust. The whole market was full of his bullock-carts. And
people were coming and asking ‘What nonsense is this? Why are you
carrying so much dust to the market-place? For what?’</p><p><br></p><p>But the man kept quiet.</p><p><br></p><p>Then a woman came. Her name was Kisagautami. And she said to this man
‘So much gold? From where could you get so much gold?’</p><p><br></p><p>He asked the woman ‘Can you see the gold here?’</p><p><br></p><p>She said ‘Oh yes. These thousand bullock-carts are full of gold.’</p><p>He took hold of the woman and asked her what secret she had. ‘How can
she see? because nobody... not even I can see that there is any gold; it
is all dust.’</p><p><br></p><p>He took the woman to Buddha, and Buddha said ‘You have found the
right woman – she will teach you the art. It is only a question of
seeing. The world is as you see it. It can be hell, it can be heaven.
Gold can be dust, and dust can be gold. It is a question of how you look
at it. This is the right woman. You become a disciple of Kisagautami.
She will teach you. And the day you know how to see rightly, the whole
world turns into gold. That is the secret of alchemy.’</p><p><br></p><p>That Kisagautami was a rare woman of those days. And the man learnt
through her the art of turning the whole world into gold.</p><p><br></p><p>When you enter the universal mind you are capable of creativity – not
as you, but as God. You become a hollow bamboo and his song starts
descending through you. He turns you into a flute.</p><p><br></p><p>If from the third, the fourth is not available you will fall into
madness. Nietzsche talks only of three minds: the camel, the lion and
the child. From the lion he falls back into the child: becomes mad.</p><p><br></p><p>There is another door too, and that is the universal mind – which is
really childhood again, but a second childhood. It is no more like the
first; it is not chaotic, it has a self-discipline. It has an inner
cosmos, an inner order – not irresponsible like the first, not
responsible like the second. A new responsibility, not towards any
values, not towards any society, but a second kind of valuation arises
because you can see what is right – how can you do otherwise? You see
the right and the right has to be done. Knowledge here becomes virtue.
You act according to your awareness; your life is transformed. There is
innocence, there is intelligence, there is love, but all is coming from
your innermost core; your inner fountain is flowing.</p><p><br></p><p>And then the fifth, the last, when you go even beyond the universal.
Because even to think that it is the universal mind is to think. You
have some ideas of the individual and the universe still left lingering
somewhere. You are still conscious that you are one with the whole, but
you ARE, and you ARE one with the whole. The unity is not yet total, is
not utter, is not ultimate. When the unity is really ultimate, there is
no individual, no universal. This is the fifth mind: Christ-mind,
Buddha-mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Now three other characteristics appear: SATCHITANANDA. SAT means
being, THAT means consciousness, ANANDA means bliss. Now these three
qualities appear, now these new flowers bloom in your being. You are for
the first time a being, becoming is no more. Man has surpassed himself,
the bridge is no more. You have come home, you are a being: SAT. And you
are utterly conscious because there is no darkness left: CHIT. And you
are ANANDA, because there is no anxiety, no tension, no misery. All that
is gone; the nightmare is over. You are fully awake. In that wakefulness
is Buddha-hood, or Christhood.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the five stages. And remember, the third is the central.
Two are below it, two are above it. If you don’t go above you will fall
below. And you cannot go above without passing through the third,
remember. These are the complexities. If you try to avoid the third you
will remain stuck in the second, and you can think that it is universal.
It is not, it is simply collective. If you try to avoid the third, you
may even remain in the first, which is idiotic. And sometimes the
idiotic.looks saintly.</p><p>In Hindi we have two words from one root for both the stages, that
root IS BUDH. The fifth we call BUDDHA, the ultimate stage, and the
first we call BUDDHU, the idiotic stage. Sometimes the idiot looks like
the saint – he has some similarities, and sometimes the saint looks like
the idiot. But they are far away – the farthest points in existence.
Jesus sometimes looks idiotic. And there have been many idiots who
looked like Jesus. The similarity is that both are without mind. The
idiot is below mind and the Christ is above mind, but both are beyond
mind. That is the similarity, but that is where it ends too. Beyond that
nothing is similar.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, the first is not the goal, it is the beginning. The second
is very comfortable, but comfort is not the question – creativity. The
third is creative but very uncomfortable, very anxious, tense. And how
long can you remain creative? – there is so much tension. The tension
has to be lost; hence, the fourth. In the fourth all is silent. Just the
last lingering of the ego has remained, that one feels ‘I am one with
the whole.’</p><p><br></p><p>A disciple of Rinzai came to the Master and said ‘I have become one
with the whole! Now what next?’</p><p><br></p><p>The Master turned him out and told him ‘Now you get rid of this idea
that you have become one with the whole. Get rid of this idea – this is
the last barrier.’</p><p><br></p><p>Another disciple said to Rinzai ‘I have attained to nothing.’ And
Rinzai said ‘Drop it. Drop that too!’</p><p>With the fourth just a very thin wall-almost transparent, you cannot
see it – remains. That also has to be dropped. Then arises the
fifth.</p><p><br></p><p>These sutras of Jesus are for the fifth.</p><p><br></p><p>AND WHEN THOU PRAYEST, THOU SHALT NOT BE AS THE HYPOCRITES ARE: FOR
THEY LOVE TO PRAY STANDING IN THE SYNAGOGUES AND IN THE CORNERS OF THE
STREETS, THAT THEY MAY BE SEEN OF MEN. VERILY I SAY UNTO YOU, THEY HAVE
THEIR REWARD.</p><p><br></p><p>And Jesus says: Don’t be a hypocrite. Don’t pray just to show others
that you are praying. That creates the collective mind. You are always
looking at others – what they think about you. You are asking for
respectability.</p><p><br></p><p>The hypocrite is one who lives for respectability. Whatsoever gives
respect to him, he goes on doing; whether he wants to do it or not is
not the point. He may even be against it. He may want to do just the
opposite, but he goes on fulfilling the desire of the people because he
needs their respect.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says</p><p><br></p><p>AND WHEN THOU PRAYEST, THOU SHALT NOT BE AS THE HYPOCRITES ARE...</p><p><br></p><p>At least when you pray, forget the society, the collective mind. At
least when you pray, forget formalities. Pray only for God, not for
anybody else.</p><p>VERILY I SAY UNTO YOU, THEY HAVE THEIR REWARD.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you pray only just to show others that you are a great prayer,
then that is your reward – the respect that you will get will be all
that you get. That is not of any worth.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT THOU, WHEN THOU PRAYEST, ENTER INTO THY CLOSET, AND WHEN THOU
HAST SHUT THY DOOR, PRAY TO THY FATHER IN SECRET.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says: Pray in secret, pray in privacy. Pray outside the
collective mind. Forget the society and the church and the people –
forget all. Because when you forget all, only then can you remember God,
not otherwise. In secret, in privacy, let your prayer be.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT WHEN YE PRAY, USE NOT VAIN REPETITIONS, AS THE HEATHEN DO: FOR
THEY THINK THAT THEY SHALL BE HEARD FOR THEIR MUCH SPEAKING.</p><p><br></p><p>And Jesus says: It is not a question of repeating any formal prayer,
the real question is of the heart – not what you say, but what you mean.
It should not be formal; a formal thing becomes dead. It should be
alive, authentic, pulsating. It should show your heart, and this moment
where you are – it should represent it. It should be true and real. And
don’t be worried, Jesus says, that you have to talk much to God. The
only way to talk with him is in silence.</p><p><br></p><p>BE NOT YE THEREFORE LIKE UNTO THEM: FOR YOUR FATHER KNOWETH WHAT
THINGS YE HAVE NEED OF BEFORE YE ASK HIM.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need to say anything. Just bowing down in silence will
do. Just becoming utterly quiet will do. Silence is the language for
prayer. But it may be difficult to go into silence directly, because all
that we know is language.</p><p><br></p><p>So Jesus says, then</p><p><br></p><p>AFTER THIS MANNER THEREFORE PRAY YE...</p><p><br></p><p>If it is very difficult to be silent, to be utterly silent, then
start in this manner. Remember, Jesus says: AFTER THIS MANNER... not
‘exactly like this.’ Find your own way, create your own prayer. At least
create your own prayer if you cannot create anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>... THEREFORE PRAY YE: OUR FATHER WHICH ART IN HEAVEN,</p><p><br></p><p>HALLOWED BE THY NAME. THY KINGDOM COME. THY WILL BE DONE IN EARTH, AS
IT IS IN HEAVEN. GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD. AND FORGIVE US OUR
DEBTS, AS WE FORGIVE OUR DEBTORS. AND LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION, BUT
DELIVER US FROM EVIL: FOR THINE IS THE KINGDOM, AND THE POWER, AND THE
GLORY, FOR EVER.</p><p><br></p><p>AMEN.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says: AFTER THIS MANNER... He IS JUST giving you an example, he
is not giving you a prayer, remember, he is simply saying ‘In this
way...’ just to show you a way. Then you create your own prayer.</p><p>The whole point is that you should be surrendered, that you should be
full of gratitude, praise, that you should be ready to receive... open,
listening. That you should be silent... IN SECRET, in privacy. Your love
has to be poured out at his feet. AFTER THIS MANNER... Find out your own
prayer, create your own prayer. Let it be your own. A borrowed prayer is
a false prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>GIVE NOT THAT WHICH IS HOLY UNTO THE DOGS, NEITHER CAST YE YOUR
PEARLS BEFORE SWINE, LEST THEY TRAMPLE THEM UNDER THEIR FEET, AND TURN
AGAIN AND REND YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says: You need not pray in the market-place, you need not pray
just to show others that you are praying. That will be wrong, that will
be like giving THAT WHICH IS HOLY UNTO THE DOGS. People who don’t
understand prayer, if you pray there, you will be misunderstood.</p><p><br></p><p>... NEITHER CAST YE YOUR PEARLS BEFORE SWINE...</p><p><br></p><p>These pearls of your heart should not be thrown before the swine.</p><p><br></p><p>... LEST THEY TRAMPLE THEM UNDER THEIR FEET AND TURN AGAIN AND REND
YOU. ASK, AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN YOU...</p><p><br></p><p>Just ask your God, just let your prayer be for him, absolutely for
him.</p><p><br></p><p>ASK, AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN YOU; SEEK, AND YE SHALL FIND; KNOCK, AND
IT SHALL BE OPENED UNTO YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>God is always ready. It is not that only you are searching for him,
he is also searching for you. KNOCK, AND IT SHALL BE OPENED UNTO YOU...
He has been waiting there a long time for you. Man’s search is not
one-sided. From the other side there is as much longing to meet – that
is the meaning of this message.</p><p><br></p><p>ASK, AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN... SEEK, AND YE SHALL FIND; KNOCK, AND IT
SHALL BE OPENED UNTO YOU: FOR EVERY ONE THAT ASKETH RECEIVETH; AND HE
THAT SEEKETH FINDETH; AND TO HIM THAT KNOCKETH IT SHALL BE OPENED.</p><p><br></p><p>THEREFORE ALL THINGS WHATSOEVER YE WOULD THAT MEN SHOULD DO TO YOU,
DO YE EVEN SO TO THEM: FOR THIS IS THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS.</p><p><br></p><p>Pray in secret... Prayer should be just an address between you and
your God, a dialogue. And then your behaviour... and Jesus has completed
the whole sketch for the religious life.</p><p><br></p><p>With people, do only that which you would like them to do to you.
That is all! In short, the whole message of the law and the prophets: Do
unto others what you would like them to do to you. That should be your
behaviour. and that is enough preparation for prayer. And then, close
your doors, go in secret and pray to your God.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have not done anything wrong to people, then there is nothing
blocking your path. If nobody is angry, if nobody is against you, if you
have not been hurting anybody – you are ready. Your prayer is going to
be heard. Then let your prayer be your own, authentic, informal.</p><p>ENTER YE IN AT THE STRAIT GATE: FOR WIDE IS THE GATE, AND BROAD IS
THE WAY, THAT LEADETH TO DEHYDRATION, AND MANY THERE BE WHICH GO IN
THEREAT: BECAUSE STRAIT IS THE GATE, AND NARROW IS THE WAY, WHICH
LEADETH UNTO LIFE, AND FEW THERE BE THAT FIND IT.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says: There are two gates. One is that of the crowd, the
collective mind, and another is of the universal mind. Both are in one
way similar – they are both gates. The difference is</p><p><br></p><p>... FOR WIDE IS THE GATE, AND BROAD IS THE WAY, THAT LEADETH TO
DESTRUCTION...</p><p><br></p><p>But where crowds move, naturally, the gate is wide, and the way is
broad. Multitudes move there. But the real gate is narrow, only you
alone can move there. They are both gates – the collective and the
universal look alike – but in the collective you are just part of the
mass, in the universal you are not part of the mass. Before the
universal you have attained to a certain freedom, ego, individuality,
self-definition – you move alone.</p><p><br></p><p>BECAUSE STRAIT IS THE GATE, AND NARROW IS THE WAY, WHICH LEADETH UNTO
LIFE, AND FEW THERE BE THAT FIND IT.</p><p><br></p><p>This thing is to be remembered: You can enter into God only in your
absolute aloneness. You cannot take even your friend with you, not even
your beloved. One has to go alone. The gate is very narrow. You cannot
go as a Hindu, you cannot take Hindus with you. You cannot go as a
Christian, you cannot go as part of the Christian mob. You will have to
go as an individual. And to have an individuality you will have to
develop the third mind. Only from the third can you enter the fourth.
And from the fourth, slowly slowly, the fifth comes on its own. It
grows, it opens like a lotus.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the five stages of the mind. Watch, observe. The first
exists in everybody, the second also in ninety-nine per cent of people,
the third in very few – three, four, five percent at the most, the
fourth not even in one per cent, and the fifth is very rare.</p><p><br></p><p>Only once is a Christ born or a Buddha. But the fifth is the goal.
Keep the goal in your vision, and go on moving, slowly slowly, from the
first to the second, from the second to the third, from the third to the
fourth.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is a becoming. With the fifth mind arising, Buddha-mind,
Christ-mind, man becomes a being. Then man is no more man, because man
is no more mind. Then man is God. And only that can be fulfilling –
nothing else. And never be satisfied by anything less.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

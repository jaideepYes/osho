‌CHAPTER 2
Come out of your Mind
22 October 1977 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
WHAT AM I TO DO WITH THE JESUS I THOUGHT I KNEW AND LOVED FOR SO LONG?
The question is from Ma Deva Chintana. She has been a nun. She has suffered enough by being a nun, and suffered for sins she has never committed.
To be a nun is a kind of masochism, a kind of self-torture inflicted upon oneself in the name of Jesus, in the name of Buddha – only the names differ, the torture is the same.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
Unless you Create Your Face
24 October 1977 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
LIFE SEEMS TO HE MEANINGLESS. WHY?
Life is... unless you give meaning to it. There is no in-built meaning in it; it has to be created. It has to be introduced, it has to be provoked. If you are waiting for some ready-made meaning, you will not get it.</description>

Question 1
SINCE I HAVE BEEN WITH YOU I HAVE COME TO KNOW JESUS IN A NEW LIGHT. AS A JEW I COULD NEVER ACCEPT HIS TEACHINGS. NEVER BEFORE DID I THINK OF HIM AS AN ENLIGHTENED BEING, AS I THINK ABOUT THE BUDDHA. WHEN I FIRST CAME IN CONTACT WITH BUDDHIST TEACHING IN NEPAL.</description>

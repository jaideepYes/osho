Go to the Very End
1 November 1977 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
WELL, I WAS BROUGHT UP AS A CATHOLIC, SO HOW COME JESUS IS A STRANGER TO ME?
Jesus is always a stranger. It does not matter whether you were brought up as a Catholic or a Protestant or a Hindu or a Mohammedan. The very being of Jesus is that of a stranger, because he is an outsider.</description>

Respect and Accept

Question 1
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GREAT SEXUAL SUPPRESSION AND FREEDOM FROM SEX? ON THE SURFACE, BOTH HAVE NO INTEREST IN SEX. HOW DOES SUPPRESSED SEX BUBBLE UP?
First, suppressed sex has more interest than expressed sex can ever have. The interest is not direct – it is indirect, it is vicarious, it is cunning; the interest is there, immensely there.</description>

Question 1
IS GOD OVERHEAD IN THE SKY, IN HEAVEN?

Significance is Inner Nourishment
7 November 1977 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
ARE THERE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF HEDONISM? I SUSPECT ‘EAT, DRINK AND BE MERRY’ MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
Yes, Anurag. There are two levels of hedonism, and they are almost polar opposites to each other. Because of that, much misunderstanding has prevailed down the ages.
The lower hedonism is of the body, and the higher hedonism is of the soul.</description>

JOHN 14
JESUS SAID UNTO HIS DISCIPLES:

2. IN MY FATHER’S HOUSE ARE MANY MANSIONS: IF IT WERE NOT SO, I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU. I GO TO PREPARE A PLACE FOR YOU.

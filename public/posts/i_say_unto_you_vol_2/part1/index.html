AND JESUS SAID UNTO HER, NEITHER DO I CONDEMN THEE: GO, AND SIN NO MORE.\nReligion always deteriorates into morality. Morality is dead religion. Religion is alive morality. They never meet, they cannot meet. because life and death never meet light and darkness never meet. But the problem is that they look very alike – the corpse looks very like the living man. Everything is just like when the man was alive: the same face, the same eyes, the same nose, the hair, the body. Just one thing is missing, and that one thing is invisible.\nLife is missing, but life is not tangible and not visible. So when a man is dead, he looks as if he is still alive. And with the problem of morality, it becomes more complex.\nMorality looks exactly like religion, but it is not. It is a corpse: it stinks of death. Religion is youth, religion is freshness – the freshness of the flowers and the freshness of the morning dew. Religion is splendour – the splendour of the stars, of life, of existence itself. When religion is there, there is no morality at all and the person is moral. But there is no morality; there is no idea of what morality is. It is just natural; it follows you as your shadow follows you. You need not carry your shadow, you need not think about your shadow. You need not look back again and again and see whether the shadow is following you still or not. It follows.\nJust like that, morality follows a religious person. He never considers it, he never deliberately thinks about it; it is his natural flavour. But when religion is dead, when life has disappeared, then one starts thinking about morality continuously. Consciousness has disappeared, and conscience becomes the only shelter.\nConscience is a pseudo phenomenon. Consciousness is yours, conscience is borrowed. Conscience is of the society of the collective mind; it does not arise in your own being. When you are conscious you act rightly because your act is conscious, and the conscious act can never go wrong. When your eyes are fully open and there is light, you don’t try to get through the wall, you go through the door. When there is no light and your eyes are also not functioning well, naturally you grope in the dark. You have to think a thousand and one times where the door is – ’To the left, to the right? Am I moving in the right direction? And you stumble upon the furniture, and you try to get out through the wall.\nA religious person is one who has eyes to see, who has awareness. In that awareness actions are naturally good. Let me repeat: naturally good. Not that you manage them to be good. Managed goodness is not goodness at all. It is pseudo, it is pretension, it is hypocrisy. When goodness is natural, spontaneous, just as trees are green and the sky is blue, so is the religious man moral – completely unaware of his morality. Aware of himself but unaware of his morality, he has no idea that\nhe is moral, that he is good, that what he is doing is right. Out of his awareness comes innocence, out of his awareness comes the right act – of its own accord. It has not to be brought, it has not to be cultivated, it has not to be practised. Then morality has a beauty, but it is no more morality; it is simply moral. In fact, it is just a religious way of living.\nBut when religion has disappeared, then you have to manage it. Then you have to constantly think about what is right and what is wrong. And how are you going to decide what is right and what is wrong? You don’t have your own eyes to see, you don’t have your own heart to feel. You are dead and dull. YoU don’t have your own intelligence to go into matters, then you have to depend on the collective mind that surrounds you.\nReligiousness has one flavour – whether you are Christian or Hindu or Mohammedan does not make any difference. A religious person is simply religious. He is neither Hindu nor Mohammedan nor Christian. But a moral person is not just moral. Either he is Hindu or Christian or Mohammedan or Buddhist, because morality has to be learnt from the outside. If you are born in a Buddhist country, in a Buddhist society, you will learn the Buddhist morality. If you are born in a Christian world, you will learn the Christian morality. You will learn from others. and you HAVE to learn from others because you don t have your own insight. So morality is borrowed; it is social, it is mob – it comes from the masses.\nAnd from where does it come to the masses? – from tradition. They have heard what is right and what is wrong, and they have carried it down the ages. It is being given from one generation to another. Nobody bothers whether it is a corpse, nobody bothers whether the heart beats still; it goes on being given from one generation to another. It is dull, dead, heavy; it kills joy, it is a killjoy. It kills celebration, it kills laughter, it makes people ugly, it makes people heavy, monotonous, boring. But it has a long tradition.\nAnother thing to be remembered: religion is always born anew. In Jesus, religion is born again. It is not the same religion that was with Moses. It has not come from Moses. It has no continuity with the past; it is utterly discontinuous with the past.\nIt arises again and again just like a flower comes on the rose bush. It has nothing to do with the flowers that had come before on the rose bush. It is discontinuous. It comes on its own; it has no past, no history, no biography. For the moment it is there, and for the moment it is so beautifully there, so authentically there. For the moment it is so strong, so alive, and yet so fragile. In the morning sun it was so young... by the evening it will be gone, the petals will start falling down into the earth from which they had come in the first place. And it will not leave any trace behind: if you come the next day, it is no more there. And it has not left any marks; it has simply disappeared. As it has come out of nothingness, so it has gone back to nothingness, to the original source .\nJust like that is religion. When it happens in a Buddha, it is fresh, young, like a rose flower. Then it disappears, it leaves no traces. Buddha has said ‘Religion is like a bird flying in the sky, it leaves no foot-marks.’ Then it happens in a Moses – it is fresh, young again. then in Jesus – it is fresh and young again. And when it will happen to you, it will not have any continuity, it will not come from somebody else – Christ, Buddha, me; it will not come from anybody else. It will ARISE in you, it will bloom in you. It will be a flowering of your being, and then it will be gone. You cannot give it to anybody; it is not transferable. It cannot be given, cannot be borrowed; it is not a thing.\nYes, if somebody wants to learn, it can be learnt. If somebody wants to imbibe, it can be imbibed. When a disciple learns around a Master, absorbs the vibes of the Master, then too it is something that is happening within him. Maybe he gets the challenge, the provocation, the call from the outside, but that which arises, arises in him, utterly in him; it does not come from the outside. It may be like you are not aware that you can sing; you have never tried, you have never thought about the possibility. Then one day you see a singer, and suddenly his song starts pulsating around you, and in a moment of awakening you become aware that you have also got a throat and a heart. And now, suddenly, for the first time, you become also aware that there has been a song hidden in you, and you release it. But the song comes from your innermost core, it arises from your being. Maybe the provocation, the call came from the outside, but not the song.\nSo the Master is a catalytic agent. His presence provokes something in you, his presence does not function as a cause.\nC.G. Jung is right in bringing a new concept to the Western world. It has existed in the East for centuries – the concept of synchronicity. There are things which happen as cause and effect, and there are things which don’t happen as cause and effect, but just by synchronicity. This idea has to be understood, because this idea will help you to understand the difference between morality and religion.\nMorality is cause and effect. Your father, your mother have taught you something: they function as the cause, and then the effect goes on continuing in you. Then you will teach your children: you will become the cause, and the effect will continue in your children. But listening to a singer, suddenly you start humming a tune. There is no cause-and-effect relationship. The singer is not the cause, and you are not the effect. You have caused the effect yourself – you are both the cause and the effect. The singer functioned only as a remembrance, the singer functioned only as a catalytic agent.\nWhat has happened to me I cannot give to you. Not that I don’t want to give it to you, no – because it cannot be given, its very nature is such that it cannot be given – but I can present it to you, I can make it available to you. Seeing that it is possible, seeing that it has happened to another man, ‘Why not to me?’ suddenly something clicks inside you, you become alert to a possibility, alert to a door that is in you but you were never looking at, you had forgotten it. And something starts sprouting in you.\nI function as a catalytic agent not as a cause. The concept of synchronicity simply says that one thing can start something somewhere without it being a cause. It says that if somebody plays sitar in a room where another sitar has been placed in the corner, and if the player is really a master, a maestro, the sitar that is just sitting there in the corner will start throbbing – because of the other sitar being played in the room, the vibe, the whole milieu. And the sitar that is just sitting there in the corner – nobody is playing it, nobody is touching it – you can see its strings vibrating, whispering. Something that is hidden is surfacing, something that was not manifest is manifesting.\nReligion is synchronicity; morality is causal. Morality comes from the outside, religion arises in you. When religion disappears there is only morality, and morality is very dangerous.\nFirst, you don’t know yourself what is right, but you start pretending: the hypocrite is created. You start pretending, you start showing that whatsoever you are doing is right. You don’t know what\nright is, and naturally, because you don’t know you can only pretend. From the back door you will continue doing the same: that you KNOW it is right. From the back door you will have one life, from the front door, another. From the front door you may be smiling, and from the back door you may be crying and weeping. From the front door you will pretend to be a saint, and from the back door you will be as much of a sinner as anybody else. Your life will become split. This is what is creating schizophrenia in the whole human consciousness. You become two, or many.\nNaturally when you are two, there is constant conflict. Naturally when you are many, there is a crowd and much noise, and you can never settle in silence, you can never rest in silence. Silence is possible only when you are one, when there is nobody else within you, when you are one piece – not fragmented.\nMorality creates schizophrenia, split personalities, divisions. A moral person is not an individual because he is divided. Only a religious person is an individual. The moral person has a personality but no individuality. Personality means PERSONA, mask. And he has many personalities, not just one, because he has to have many personalities around him. In different situations, different personalities are needed. With different people, different personalities are needed. To one he shows one face, to another he shows another face. One goes on changing faces.\nWatch, and you will see how you go on changing faces every moment. Alone you have one face. In your bathroom you have one face, in the office you have another. Have you observed the fact that in your bathroom you become more childish? Sometimes you can show your tongue to yourself in the mirror, or you can make faces, or you can hum a tune, sing a song, or you can even have a little dance in the bathroom. But while you are dancing or showing your tongue in the mirror, if you become aware that your child is looking through the keyhole, you change – immediate change! The old face comes back... the father personality. ‘This cannot be done in front of the child’ otherwise what will he think? – that you are also like him? So what about that seriousness that you show to him always? You immediately pull down another face; you become serious. The song disappears, the dance disappears, the tongue disappears. You are back into your so-called front-door personality.\nMorality creates conflict in you because it creates many faces. And the problem is that when you have many faces, you tend to forget which is your original one. With so many faces how can you remember which is your original one?\nThe Zen Masters say the first thing for a seeker to know is his original face, because only then can something start. Only the original face can grow, a mask cannot grow. A false face can have no growth. Growth is possible only for the original face, because only the original has life.\nSo the first thing is to know ‘What is my original face?’ and it is arduous, because there is a long queue of false faces, and you are lost in your false faces. And sometimes you may think ‘This is my original face.’ If you go deep into it, you will find this again is a false face, maybe it is more ancient than the others, so it looks more original.\nThe Zen Masters say: If you really want to see your original face, you will have to go before birth, you will have to conceive of what your face was before you were born, or what your face will be when you are dead.\nBetween birth and death you have all kinds of false faces. Even a small child starts learning the pseudo tricks, diplomacies. Just a small child – maybe one day old, just out of the womb – starts learning, because he sees that if he smiles, then mother feels very good. If he smiles the mother immediately gives her breast to him. If he smiles, the mother comes close, hugs him, pats him. He has learned a trick, that if he wants the mother to be close to him, if he wants to be hugged and kissed and talked to, he has to smile. Now the diplomat is born, the politician is born. Whenever he wants the mother to pull him close... He cannot call, he cannot talk, but he can wait until she looks at him then he can smile. The moment he smiles, the mother comes running. Now whether he feels like smiling in this moment or not is not the point, he wants the mother, he wants to manipulate the mother. He has a trick, a strategy, a technique which he has learned: smile, and mother comes. Then he will go on smiling, and whenever he wants somebody to come close, he will smile. And this face will not be the true face.\nYour smiles are not true. Your tears are also not true. Your whole personality is synthetic, plastic. The moral person, the so-called moralist, has many personalities but no individuality. The religious person has individuality but no personality. He is one. His taste is always one.\nBuddha is reported to have said: Taste me from anywhere and you will find the same taste as when you taste the sea. From this side, from that side, from this shore, from that shore – taste the sea from anywhere and it is salty. And Buddha says: So is my taste. Taste me while I am asleep, taste me while I am awake, taste me when somebody is insulting me, taste me when somebody is praising me – you will always find the same taste, the taste of a Buddha.\nThe religious person is an individual.\nThe second thing to be remembered: the moralist is always making efforts to impose his morality on others – for many reasons. First: he uses his morality to manipulate himself. Naturally, he does the same to others; he starts using his morality to manipulate others. He uses morality for his own strategies, diplomacies. Naturally, he learns a trick: that if he can enforce his morality on others, then things will be easier.\nFor example, if the moralist speaks the truth, his truth is not very deep. Deep down there are only lies and lies. But at least in society he pretends to speak the truth. He will try to impose his truth on others also. He would like everybody else to speak the truth, because he will be very much afraid that if somebody lies and tricks him, deceives him... And he knows that he himself is Lying and deceiving people in subtle words, but on the surface he keeps the truth. And he goes on shouting ‘Everybody should be true!’ He is very much afraid. He knows that just as he is deceiving others, others may be deceiving him.\nBertrand Russell has said that thieves are always against stealing. A thief has to be against stealing, otherwise somebody will steal things from him. And he has been making so much effort to steal things from others that if others steal things from him, then what will be the point? A thief will always shout ‘Stealing is bad! Never steal! You will be thrown into hell!’ So nobody steals, then the thief is free to steal.\nIf nobody speaks untruths, then you can speak untruths and exploit people easily. If everybody speaks untruths, how can you exploit? Just think: a society where everybody speaks untruths, and\nit is an accepted phenomenon that everybody tells lies. Then you will be at a loss – you will not be able to cheat people. Whatsoever you say, people will think you are a liar – ‘Everybody tells lies here’; nobody can be deceived. So, in his own interest, the liar has to go on preaching morality. ‘Speak the truth, never steal, do this, do that’ – and from the back door he goes on doing just the opposite. This has to be understood.\nIf somebody’s pocket is picked right now – somebody steals – then many will be there shouting ‘Catch the thief! Kill the thief! Who is there?’ And many will shout. Remember, the shouters are just showing one thing: that they are also thieves. By shouting they are showing many things. One thing is: ‘Remember, I am not the thief, because I am so much against. Nobody should ever think or suspect me because I am against all of this kind of thing. I am a moral person.’ Those who are pickpockets will shout more, and if the real pickpocket is caught, then the pickpockets will beat him to show everybody that they are very much against it.\nThis is a very very complex phenomenon. A religious person is a totally different person. He will be able to forgive, he will be able to understand. He will be able to see the limitations of man and the problems of man. He will not be so hard and so cruel – he cannot be. His compassion will be infinite.\nBefore we enter into these sutras, a few things have to be understood.\nFirst: the concept of sin, the concept of the immoral act. What is immoral? How should we define immorality? and what is the criterion? One thing is immoral in India, another thing is immoral in China. That which is immoral in India may be moral in Iran, and that which is moral in Russia may be immoral in India. There are a thousand and one moralities. How to decide? – because now that the world has become a global village, there is much confusion. What is right?\nTo eat meat is right? Is it moral or immoral? The vegetarian says it is immoral. Many Jains have come to me many times and said ‘What about Jesus eating meat? How can Jesus be an enlightened person – and you say that he is enlightened – how can he be an enlightened person? He cats meat.’ For a Jain it is impossible to conceive that Jesus can be enlightened although he eats meat. Jains have come to me and said to me ‘How can Ramakrishna be enlightened? He eats fish. He cannot be.’ Now they have a very definite criterion with them – vegetarianism.\nOne Jain monk was talking to me, and he said ‘I cannot believe that Jesus or Ramakrishna are enlightened, they eat meat.’\nI told him ‘Do you know that there are people in the world who think that to drink milk is almost like eating meat? – because it is an animal food. Now, milk is an animal food. It is almost like blood because it comes out of the mother’s blood. It is also full of live bacteria. There are people in the world, real fanatics, who take things to the very extreme. They say that milk, cheese, and butter are all animal foods – they have to be avoided.’\nI asked the Jain monk ‘Mahavir used to drink milk. What do you say? He was drinking an animal food. Was he enlightened or not? Now Indian scriptures say milk is the purest food – SATTVIKA – the MOST PURE food is milk. It is not. It is an animal food!’\nThat Jain monk started perspiring when he heard that milk is an animal food. And he said ‘What are you talking about? Milk is the SATTVIK food, the purest food!’\nBut I said ‘This is the analysis, the scientific analysis. Prove it wrong. That’s why when you drink too much milk your face starts becoming red: milk creates blood – it becomes blood in you. That’s why milk is so vital. And milk is a hundred per cent food, that’s why children live only on milk. It supplies everything. It becomes blood, it becomes your flesh, it becomes your skin, your bone, your marrow; it becomes everything. It is pure animal food. Now how to decide who is right?’\nThere are a thousand and one moralities. If you go on deciding, you will be in difficulty; it will be impossible for you. You will go mad, you will not be able to eat, you will not be able to sleep, you will not be able to do anything!\nNow, there is a Jain sect which is afraid of breathing. To breathe is immoral, because with each breath you kill many many small cells living around you in the air. They are true. That’s why the doctor has to use a mask, so that he does not go on inhaling things which are moving around – infections. That Jain sect is afraid to breathe. Breathing becomes immoral.\nWalking becomes immoral – there are Jains who don’t walk in the night because they may kill something, an ant or something, in the darkness. Mahavir never moved in the night, never moved in the rainy season because then there are many more insects around. Movement becomes difficult, breathing becomes difficult. If you go on looking around at all the moralities, you will simply go crazy or you will have to commit suicide. But to commit suicide is immoral!\nIf you listen to all kinds of moralities that seems to be the logical thing: just commit suicide. That seems to be the least immoral thing. One act and you are finished, then there will be no immorality. But that too is immoral. And when you commit suicide you are not dying alone, remember. It is not killing one person. You have millions of cells in the body which are alive, millions of lives inside you, which will die with you. So you have killed millions of people. When you fast, is it moral or immoral?\nThere are people who say to fast is moral, and there are people who say to fast is immoral. Why? – because when you fast you kill many cells inside, because they die of starvation. If you fast, then one kilo in weight disappears every day. You are killing many things inside you. One kilo in weight disappears every day. Within a month you will be just a structure of bones. All those people who used to live inside you – small people – they have all died. You have killed all of them.\nOr there are people who say to fast is like eating meat. Mow... very strange. And that is true, there is a logic to it. When one kilo in weight disappears, where has it gone? You have eaten it! Your body needs that kind of food every day. You go on replacing it with outside food. If you don’t replace it with outside food... the body goes on eating because the body needs; for twenty-four hours, the body has to live. It needs a certain fuel. Then it starts eating its own flesh. To be on a fast is to be a cannibal.\nThese moralities can drive you mad! There is no way to choose. Then what is moral to me? To be aware is moral. What you are doing is not the question. If you are doing it in full awareness, then whatsoever it is – it is irrelevant what it is – irrespective of the fact of what it is, if you are doing in full awareness, it is moral. If you are doing unawares, unconscious, then it is immoral.\nTo me, morality means awareness.\nThe French language seems to be the only language which has only one word for two words: conscience and consciousness. That seems to be very very beautiful. Consciousness is conscience. Ordinarily, consciousness is one thing and conscience is another thing. Consciousness is yours. Conscience is given to you by others: it is a conditioning.\nLive by consciousness, become more and more conscious, and you will become more and more moral – and you will not become a moralist. You will become moral, and you will not become a moralist. The moralist is an ugly phenomenon.\nNow the sutras:\nJESUS WENT UNTO THE MOUNT OF OLIVES.\nHe always used to go to the mountains whenever he would feel that his consciousness was becoming dusty, his mirror was covered with dust. He would go to the mountains in aloneness to cleanse his being, to cleanse his consciousness. It is like you take a bath, and after the bath you feel the body is fresh, young.\nMeditation is like an inner bath. To be alone for a few moments every day is a must; otherwise you will gather too much dust, and because of that dust your mirror will not reflect any more, or will not reflect rightly. It may start distorting things.\nHave you not watched? A single dust particle goes in your eye, and your vision becomes distorted. The same is true about the inner vision – the inner eye – so much dust goes on collecting, and dust comes from relationship. Just as when you travel on a dusty road, you collect dust; when you move with people who are dusty, you collect dust. They are all throwing their dust all around, they are all throwing wrong vibes – and they cannot do anything, they are helpless. I am not saying that you condemn them. What can they do?\nIf you go to a hospital and everybody is ill in the hospital, and if they are throwing their infections all around – they can’t help it. They breathe and the infection goes out. Have you not seen it when you go to the hospital to see somebody? Just one hour in the hospital and you start feeling a kind of sickness, and you had come perfectly healthy? Just the smell of the hospital, just the faces of the nurses and the doctors, and the medical instruments, and that particular hospital smell, and people who are all ill, and the whole vibe of illness and death always there... somebody is always dying.\nJust one hour there and you feel very low; a kind of nausea arises in you.\nComing out of the hospital you feel a great relief. The same is the situation in the world. You don’t know because you live in the world. The nurse who goes on working in the hospital, and the doctor who goes on working in the hospital – they have to become insensitive, otherwise they would die. They would not be able to live there. They have become insensitive; they go on moving. That’s why many times you see doctors looking very very insensitive – that is their protection. The patient goes on saying that this is wrong and that is wrong, and the doctor stands there almost not listening. The relatives of the patient go on running after the doctor and go on telling him that this\nis going wrong and that is... And he says ‘Everything will be okay. I will come tomorrow morning. When I come on my round, I will see.’ Now you are feeling so concerned, and he seems to be absolutely unconcerned. This is just to protect himself. If he becomes too sensitive, he will not be able to survive. He has to become hard, he has to create a kind of stoniness around himself. That stoniness will protect him – will protect him from the hospital and the patients and the whole atmosphere. Doctors become hard, insensitive; nurses become hard, insensitive.\nThe same is happening in the world at large. It is a kind of big hospital, because everybody is ill here and everybody is on the deathbed; and everybody is full of anger and violence and aggression and jealousy and possessiveness; and everybody is false, pseudo, and everybody is a hypocrite – this is the world. You don’t feel it, but when a Jesus moves amidst you, he feels it because he comes from the heights. He descends from the mountains.\nIf you go to the Himalayas and after living few days in the Himalayan freshness you come back to the plains, then you feel how dusty, how ugly, how heavy the vibe is. Now you have comparison. You have seen the fresh waters of the Himalayas – those fresh fountains running forever, and the crystal-clear water – and then the municipal tap water. You have the comparison then. Only a meditator knows that the world is ill, only a meditator feels that everything is wrong here. And when a meditator moves amidst you, naturally he feels much more dust collecting on himself than you can feel, because you have lost all sensitivity.\nYou have forgotten that you are.a mirror! You know that you are just a dust collector. Only a meditator knows that he is a mirror.\nSo Jesus goes again and again to the mountains. JESUS WENT...\nunto the mountains\n... UNTO THE MOUNT OF OLIVES. AND EARLY IN THE MORNING HE CAME AGAIN INTO THE TEMPLE, AND ALL THE PEOPLE CAME UNTO HIM; AND HE SAT DOWN, AND TAUGHT THEM.\nAND EARLY IN THE MORNING HE CAME... INTO THE TEMPLE...\nOnly when you have been to the mountains – and that does not mean that you really have to go to the mountains. It is not an outer phenomenon. The mount is within you. If you can be alone, if you can forget the whole world for a few seconds, you will regain your freshness. And only then can you go to the temple, because only then you ARE a temple. And only then will your presence in the temple be a real presence; and there will be a harmony between you and the temple Remember, unless you bring your temple to the temple, there is no temple. If you simply go to the temple, and don’t bring your temple there within you, it is just a house.\nWhen Jesus goes into a house, it becomes a temple. When you go into a temple. it becomes a house – because we carry our own temples inside. Wherever Jesus goes it becomes a temple, his presence creates that sacred quality. And only when you bring the temple and the freshness of the mountains, and the virginity of the mountains, only then can you teach. You can teach only THEN, when you HAVE it.\nAND EARLY IN THE MORNING HE CAME AGAIN INTO THE TEMPLE, AND ALL THE PEOPLE CAME UNTO HIM; AND HE SAT DOWN, AND TAUGHT THEM.\nAND THE SCRIBES AND PHARISEES BROUGHT UNTO HIM A WOMAN TAKEN IN ADULTERY; AND WHEN THEY HAD SET HER IN THE MIDST,\nTHEY SAID UNTO HIM, MASTER, THIS WOMAN WAS TAKEN IN ADULTERY, IN THE VERY ACT.\nNOW MOSES IN THE LAW COMMANDED US, THAT SUCH SHOULD BE STONED: BUT WHAT SAYEST THOU?\nThis is one of the most important parables in Jesus’ life. Go into it slowly, delicately, carefully. AND THE SCRIBES AND PHARISEES...\nNow for that you can read ‘the moralists and the puritans’. In those days those were the names of the moralists, the pundits, the scholars – ‘the scribes and the Pharisees’. The Pharisees were the people who were very respectable. On their surfaces very moral, pretentious, with great egos. ‘We are moral and everybody else is immoral’ – and always searching and looking into people’s faults. Their whole life is concerned with that: how to exaggerate their own qualities and how to reduce others’ qualities to nil.\nThe puritans, the moralists\n... BROUGHT UNTO HIM A WOMAN TAKEN IN ADULTERY,\nNow when you come to a man like Jesus, you have to come there in humbleness, you have to come there imbibe something from Jesus; it is a rare opportunity. And now here come these fools and they bring a woman. They bring their ordinary mind, their mediocre mind, their stupidities with them.\nAND THE SCRIBES AND PHARISEES BROUGHT UNTO HIM A WOMAN TAKEN IN ADULTERY...\nThey have not learnt even this simple lesson that when you go to a man like Jesus or Buddha, you go to partake, to participate in his consciousness: you go to become intimate with him. You don’t bring the ordinary problems of life there; they are irrelevant. That will be wasting a great opportunity, that will be wasting Jesus’ time. And he had not much time, as I told you before – only three years of ministry. And these fools were wasting like this... But they had a certain strategy in it: it was a trap.\nThey were not really concerned with the woman. They were creating a trap for Jesus. It was a very diplomatic act.\nAND THE SCRIBES AND PHARISEES BROUGHT UNTO HIM A WOMAN TAKEN IN ADULTERY; AND WHEN THEY HAD SET HER IN THE MIDST, THEY SAID UNTO HIM, MASTER, THIS WOMAN WAS TAKEN IN ADULTERY, IN THE VERY ACT.\nNow what is adultery?\nA conscious mind will say if you don’t love a man – maybe the man is your own husband – if you don’t love the man and you sleep with the man, it is adultery. If you don’t love the woman – and she may be your own wife – if you don’t love her and you sleep with her, you are exploiting her, you are deceiving her. It is adultery.\nBut that is not the definition of the Pharisees and the puritans and the scribes and the pundits. their definition is legal, their definition does not arise out of consciousness or love. Their definition arises out of the legal court. If the woman is not your wife and you have been found sleeping with her, it is adultery. It is just a legal matter, technical. The heart is not taken into account, only the law. You may be deeply in love with the man or with the woman, but that is not to be taken into account. The unconscious mind cannot take higher things into account. He can only take the lowest into account.\nHis problem is always legal. Is it YOUR woman? YOUR wife? Are you legally wed to her? Then it is good, then it is no more sin. If she is not your woman, you are not legally wed to her... You may be in deep love, and you may have immense respect for the woman – you may almost be a worshipper of the woman – but it is sin, it is adultery.\nThese people brought this woman to Jesus, and\nTHEY SAID UNTO HIM, MASTER, THIS WOMAN WAS TAKEN IN ADULTERY, IN THE VERY ACT.\nJust the other day I was reading the memoirs of an English Christian missionary who went to Japan in the early days of this century. He was taken around Tokyo. His host took him around to show him the city. In one public bath there were men and women taking their baths in the nude. The missionary was very much shocked.\nHe stood there for five minutes, watched everything, and then he told his host ‘Is it not immoral – women and men taking baths naked in a public place?’\nAnd the host said ‘Sir, this is not immoral in our country, but to stand here and watch is immoral. Sorry to say’ he said ’but I am feeling very guilty standing with you, because that is THEIR business if they want to take a bath naked. That is THEIR freedom. But why are you standing here? This is ugly, immoral.\nNow the missionary’s standpoint is very ordinary, and the host’s standpoint is extraordinary. These people say\nMASTER, THIS WOMAN WAS TAKEN IN ADULTERY, IN THE VERY ACT.\nAnd what were you doing there?\nThese were peeping Toms or... what type of people were these? What were you doing there? Why should you be concerned?\nThis woman’s life is her life. How she wants to spend her life is her concern. Who are you to interfere? But the puritan, the moralist, has always been interfering in other people’s lives. He is not democratic, he is very dictatorial. He wants to manipulate people, condemn people.\nNow what were these people doing there? And they say\nMASTER, THIS WOMAN WAS TAKEN IN ADULTERY, IN THE VERY ACT.\nThey have caught the woman while she was making love.\nOne thing more: Where is the man? She was doing adultery alone...? Nobody has ever asked THIS question about this parable. I have read many Christian books, but nobody has ever asked ‘Where is the man?’\nBut it is a man’s society. It is always the woman who is wrong, not the man. The man will go free perfectly well. He may himself be a Pharisee, he may himself be a respectable man – but the woman has to be condemned. Have you not observed it? Prostitutes are condemned, but where are the prostituters? Where are those people? They may be the same people who condemn.\nNow Morarji Desai wants to bring prohibition to the country. And in his own ministry, out of seventeen, twelve are drunkards. Twelve! And he himself does not drink, that is true, but he drinks his own urine. That is a far worse case! But he wants to bring prohibition on the country. He wants to put it through force. Maybe because he has not been drinking... He wants to take revenge on others, on what?\nPuritans are always ugly people. They don’t live, but then they don’t allow anybody else to live. Their only joy is how to kill other people’s joys, how to kill everybody’s celebration.\nNow what were these people doing there? Don’t they have anything else to do? Don’t they have their own women to love? What kind of people are these? They must be a little perverted to go out searching and seeking who is committing adultery. And then where is the man? Just the woman has to be condemned always.\nWhy does the woman have to be condemned? Because the woman is a woman and the man is the dominant one, and all the legal codes have been made by men. They are very very prejudicial, biased. All the legal courts say what should be done to a woman if she is found in adultery, but they don’t say anything about what should be done to the man. No, they say ‘Boys are boys. And boys will be boys.’ It is always a question of the woman.\nEven if a man rapes a woman, the woman becomes condemned; she loses respect not the rapist!\nThis is an ugly state of affairs. This can’t be called religious, it is very political – basically in man’s favour and against woman. And all your so-called moralities have been that way.\nIn India, when a husband used to die, the wife had to go with him to the funeral pyre, then only was she thought to be virtuous. she had to become a SATI, she had to die with the husband. If she did not die, that meant she was not virtuous. That simply meant she wanted to live without the husband, or maybe she wanted the husband to die, now she wanted freedom, now she would fall in love with somebody else.\nIn India it has been thought then that for the woman there is no life once the husband is dead. Her husband is her whole life. If the husband is gone, she has to go. But nothing is said about the man if his woman dies – no prescription for him that he should die with the woman. No, that is no problem. Immediately after the woman has died... In India it happens every day: the people are burning the woman and then coming back home they start thinking about the new marriage – where the man should find a new woman, how to find. Not a single day is lost.\nFor man the morality is different, for woman it is different. Then it is a very unconscious morality, and very IMMORAL MORALITY.\nMy definition of morality is that of consciousness, and consciousness is neither man nor woman. Consciousness is just consciousness. Only when something is decided by your being conscious will it be classless, will it be beyond the distinctions of body, caste, creed. And only then is it moral.\nMASTER, they say, THIS WOMAN WAS TAKEN IN ADULTERY, IN THE VERY ACT.\nNOW MOSES IN THE LAW COMMANDED US, THAT SUCH SHOULD BE STONED: BUT WHAT SAYEST THOU?\nTHIS THEY SAID, TEMPTING HIM, THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO ACCUSE HIM. BUT JESUS STOOPED DOWN, AND WITH HIS FINGER WROTE ON THE GROUND, AS THOUGH HE HEARD THEM NOT.\nThis w as the trap. They wanted to trap Jesus, because Moses has said that such a woman should be stoned. Nothing is said about the man. Such a woman should be stoned to death: Moses has said this. Now they are creating a problem for Jesus. If Jesus says ‘Yes, do as Moses says’ then they can accuse him, because he has always been talking about love, compassion, kindness, forgiveness. Then they can say ‘What about your compassion? What about your forgiveness? What about your love? You say this woman has to be killed by stones? This is hard and cruel and violent.’\nTricky fellows.\nAnd if Jesus says ‘This is not right. Moses is not right’ then they can say ‘So you have come to destroy Moses? So you have come to destroy and corrupt our religion? And you have been saying to people “I have come not to destroy but to fulfil.” What about that? If you have come to fulfil, then follow Moses’ law!’ Now they are creating a dilemma. This is the trap. They are not much concerned about the woman, remember, their REAL target is Jesus; the woman is just an excuse. And they have brought such a case... That’s why they say IN THE VERY ACT, red-handed. So it is not a question of deciding whether the woman has really committed adultery. Otherwise, Jesus will have an excuse to get out. He will say ‘First, try to find out whether REALLY it has happened. Bring the witnesses. Let it first be decided.’ Then it will take years. So they say ‘Red-handed! We have caught her in the very act. We are all the witnesses, so there is no question of deciding anything else. And the law is clear: Moses has said that such should be stoned.’\n... BUT WHAT SAYEST THOU?\n’Do you agree with Moses? If you agree, then what about your love and compassion – your whole message? If you don’t agree, then what do you mean when you say “I have come to fulfil”? Then\nyou have come to destroy Moses’ law. So do you think you are higher than Moses? Do you think that you know more than Moses?’\n... BUT WHAT SAYEST THOU? THIS THEY SAID, TEMPTING HIM, THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO ACCUSE HIM. BUT JESUS STOOPED DOWN, AND WITH HIS.FINGER WROTE ON THE GROUND, AS THOUGH HE HEARD THEM NOT.\nWhy? Why did Jesus stoop down? Why did he start writing on the ground?\nThey were just on the bank of a river. Jesus was sitting in the sand. Why has he started writing on the sand? What has happened?\nThere is one thing to be understood: it is always a delicate problem. For example, if I see something stated by Buddha as wrong, there is a great hesitation to say that he is wrong. He cannot be wrong. Tradition must have misinterpreted him. Something must have been wrongly put into his mouth. Buddha cannot be wrong. But now there is no way to decide, because the scriptures say this clearly...\nJesus hesitating., .Jesus is concerned. He does not want to say a single word against Moses, but he has to say, hence the hesitation. He does not want to say anything against Moses because Moses CANNOT say it that way. It is his inner feeling that Moses cannot say it that way. But the inner feeling cannot be decisive. These people will say ‘Who are you? And why should we care about your inner feeling? We have the written code with us, given by our forefathers. It is there written clearly!’\nJesus does not want to say anything against Moses, because he REALLY has come to fulfil Moses. Anybody who becomes enlightened in the world is always fulfilling all the enlightened ones that have preceded him. Even if sometimes he says something against them, then, too, he is fulfilling them, because he cannot say anything against them. And if you feel that he is saying something against them, then he is saying something against the tradition, against the scripture. But that looks like saying something against Moses, against Buddha, against Abraham. Hence, he stoops down. He starts looking at the sand and then starts writing. He is puzzled about what to do. He has to find a way out.\nHe has to find the way out in such a way that he has not to say anything against Moses, and YET he cancels the whole law. And he really comes with a very very miraculous answer, a magical answer.\nSO WHEN THEY CONTINUED ASKING HIM, HE LIFTED UP HIMSELF, AND SAID UNTO THEM, HE THAT IS WITHOUT SIN AMONG YOU, LET HIM FIRST CAST A STONE AT HER.\nIt is really incredible, it is beautiful – that was his hesitation. He has found a golden mean. He has not said a single word against Moses and he has not supported Moses either. This is the delicate point to understand.\nJesus was really utterly intelligent – uneducated, but utterly intelligent, a man of immense awareness. That’s the only reason why he could find the way out.\nHe says\nHE THAT IS WITHOUT SIN AMONG YOU...\nHe says ‘Perfectly right’ does not say directly that Moses is right. but he says ‘Perfectly right. If Moses says so, then it must be so. But then, who should start throwing stones at this woman?’\nHE THAT IS WITHOUT SIN AMONG YOU, LET HIM FIRST CAST A STONE AT HER.\n‘So start, but only those who are without sin...’\nNow this is a new thing that Jesus brings in. You can judge only if you are without sin. You can punish only if you are without sin. If you are also in the same boat, then what is the point? Then who is going to punish whom?\nAND AGAIN HE STOOPED DOWN, AND WROTE ON THE GROUND.\nWhy did he stoop down again? Because he must have been afraid; some foolish person is always possible. He knows that everybody has committed one sin or other. If they have not committed, then they have been thinking to commit – which is almost the same.\nWhether you think or you act makes no difference. Remember, the difference between sin and crime is this: Crime has to be acted out, only then is it crime. You can go on thinking, but if you don’t commit it to action, no court can punish you because it never becomes a crime. And only crime is within the jurisdiction of the court, not sin. Then what is sin? Sin is if you think ‘I would like to murder this man.’ No court can do anything. You can say ‘Yes, I have been thinking of it my whole life’ – but thinking is beyond the court’s jurisdiction. You are allowed to think. No court can punish you because you dreamt that you killed somebody. You can dream every day, and you can go on killing as many people as you want. No court can catch hold of you unless it comes to actuality, unless thought becomes deed, unless thought is translated into reality. If it comes out of you and affects society, then it becomes crime. But it is sin, because God can go on reading your thoughts. There is no need for him to read your acts. The magistrate has to read your acts, he cannot read your thoughts; he is not a thought-reader or a mind-reader.\nBut for God there is no difference; whether you think or you do, it is all the same. The moment you think, you have done it.\nSo Jesus says HE THAT IS WITHOUT SIN AMONG YOU... not without crime. He says HE THAT IS WITHOUT SIN AMONG YOU, LET HIM.FIRST CAST A STONE AT HER. That distinction was\nknown down the ages: that if you think it, you have committed a sin already. AND AGAIN HE STOOPED DOWN...\nWhy this time? – because if he goes on looking at people. his very look may be provocative. If he goes on looking at people then somebody, just from his look and out of his offense may throw a stone at the poor woman. He does not want to offend; he withdraws. He simply stoops down, starts writing in the sand-again as if he is not there. He becomes absent, because his presence can be dangerous. If they have come just to trap him, and he is there and they feel his presence, it will be difficult for them to feel their own consciences, their own consciousnesses. He withdraws into\nhimself, he allows them total freedom to think about it. He does not interfere; his presence can be an interference. If he goes on looking at them, that will be offensive to their egos. And it will be difficult for them to escape also, because then it will feel bad that somebody was standing just in front of the mayor of the town or somebody – the respectable people... and how can the mayor escape when Jesus is looking? And if he escapes and does not throw the stone at the woman, it will be a proof that he is a sinner.\nHe stoops down again, starts writing on the sand, gives them a chance – if they want to escape they can escape.\nAND THEY WHICH HEARD IT, BEING CONVICTED BY THEIR OWN CONSCIENCE...\nJesus leaves them alone. That is the beauty of the man. He does not even interfere by his presence; he is simply no more there. Their own consciences starts pricking. They know. Maybe many times they have lusted after THIS woman, and maybe they themselves have been participants with this woman in the past. Maybe this woman is a prostitute, and all these respectable people in their turn have made love to her. Because one prostitute means that almost the whole town becomes involved.\nIn India, in the ancient days, prostitutes were called NAGARVADHU, the wife of the town. That is the right name.\nSo all of these people must have been involved in some way or other with this woman or with other women – if not in acts, then in thoughts.\nMy feeling is it must be evening and the sun is setting, it is becoming dark and Jesus is writing on the sand, stooping down, and it becomes dark. And by and by people start disappearing in the dark.\nAND THEY WHICH HEARD IT, BEING CONVICTED BY THEIR OWN CONSCIENCE, WENT OUT ONE BY ONE, BEGINNING AT THE ELDEST – THE MAYOR – EVEN UNTO THE LAST...\nFirst the eldest disappeared, because of course, they have lived long, so they have sinned long. The young people may not be such great sinners; they have had not enough time yet. But the oldest disappeared first. Those who were standing in front, they must have moved slowly to the back, and then from the back they escaped. Because this man has really created a great problem: he has changed the whole situation. They had come to trap him and they are trapped.\nYou cannot trap a Jesus or a Buddha; it is impossible – you will be trapped. You exist at a lower state of mind. How can you trap a higher state of mind? That is just foolish. The higher state can trap you immediately, because from the higher state your whole being is available.\nNow Jesus must have looked into these people’s consciences – that was possible for him – he must have seen all kinds of sins raising their heads. In fact, even standing there, they were thinking about the woman: how to get hold of her. Maybe they were angry because somebody else had committed the sin and they were not given the opportunity. Maybe they were only jealous: maybe they wanted to be there instead of that man who had not been brought. ]esus must have looked from his height into their hearts. He has trapped them. They forget their trap completely, they forget about Moses\nand the law etcetera. In fact, they were never worried about Moses and the law. This has also to be understood.\nThey were really more interested in stoning this woman, enjoying this murder. Not that they were interested in punishing somebody who had committed a sin; that was just an excuse. They could not leave this opportunity of murdering this woman. And now Moses can be used.\nThere are a thousand and one things said by Moses. They are not worried about them. They are not interested in all those sayings and all those statements. They are interested in this: that Moses says you can stone a woman if you catch hold of her in adultery. They can’t miss this great opportunity of murder, of violence. And when violence can be committed according to the law, who would like to miss it? Not only will they enjoy the violence, they will enjoy that they are very very legal people, virtuous followers of Moses. But they have all forgotten about it. Just a little turning by Jesus, and they have forgotten about Moses... He has changed the whole point. He has changed their minds from the woman to themselves. He has converted them, he has turned them backwards – a one hundred and eighty degree turn. They were thinking about the woman and Moses and Jesus, and he has changed their whole attitude. He has made them their own target. He has turned their consciousness.\nNow he says ‘Look into yourself. If you have never committed a sin, then... then you are allowed, then you can kill this woman.’\nWHEN JESUS HAD LIFTED UP HIMSELF...\nhe saw they had all gone\n... EVEN UNTO THE LAST: AND JESUS WAS LEFT ALONE, AND THE WOMAN STANDING IN THE MIDST.\nWHEN JESUS HAD LIFTED UP HIMSELF, AND SAW NONE BUT THE WOMAN, HE SAID UNTO HER, WOMAN, WHERE ARE THOSE THINE ACCUSERS?\nNow he is not saying ‘I am accusing you.’\n... WHERE ARE THOSE THINE ACCUSERS?\nHe is not for a single moment a participant in it. He has not judged, he has not condemned. He has not said a single thing to the woman. He simply says.\nWOMAN WHERE ARE THOSE THINE ACCUSERS? HATH NO MAN CONDEMNED THEE?\nHave they all gone? Has no man thrown a stone at you? SHE SAID, NO MAN, LORD.\nShe must have felt deep respect, reverence for this man, who has not only saved her physically, but who has not even accused her in any way. Spiritually also he has saved her. She must have looked into those eyes which have only love and compassion and nothing else.\nThis is the religious man. The moralist is always condemning, accusing; the religious man, always accepting, forgiving.\nSHE SAID, NO MAN, LORD. AND JESUS SAID UNTO HER, NEITHER DO I CONDEMN THEE: GO, AND SIN NO MORE.\nJesus says ‘Nothing to be worried about – the past. The past is past, gone is gone. Forget about it. But take some lesson from this situation. Don’t go on making the same mistakes in the future – if you think they are mistakes. I am not accusing you.’\nNEITHER DO I CONDEMN THEE...\n‘But if you feel that you have done something wrong, then it is up to you. Don’t do it again. Forget the past, and don’t go on repeating it.’\nThat is the whole message of all the Buddhas and all the Christs and all the Krishnas: Forget the past, and if you understand, then don’t do it again. That’s enough. There is no punishment, there is no judgement. If you have been doing something, you were helpless. You are unconscious, you have your limitations. You have your desires, unfulfilled desires. Whatsoever you have been doing was the only thing you could have done. So what is the point of accusing and condemning you? The only thing that can be done is: your consciousness can be raised high.\nAnd that woman must have moved into a high consciousness. She must have been afraid that she was going to be killed. Then this man, by a single statement, saved her from death. Not only that, those accusers disappeared. This man did a miracle! Not only that they didn’t kill her, they simply became ashamed and escaped like thieves into the darkness of the night. This man is a magician.\nAnd now, he is saying ‘I don’t condemn you. If you feel you have been doing something wrong, don’t do it again. That’s enough.’ He has converted the woman.\nThis is what acid people call a ‘contact high’. Jesus is high, If you come into close affinity with him, you will start moving high. This is synchronicity – non-causal. The woman must have come there almost condemning herself, ashamed of herself, thinking to commit suicide. He has raised that woman, transformed that woman.\nSHE SAID, NO MAN, LORD.\nJesus becomes LORD, Jesus becomes God to her. She has never seen such a godly man before. With no condemnation a man becomes a God. With no judgement a man becomes a God. And just his presence, a single statement, and those people disappeared and she is saved. And not only saved physically, but spiritually intact. Jesus has not interfered at all. He has not condemned, he has not said a single word. He simply says ‘Don’t repeat your past’ – not a single word more. ‘Let the past be past and the gone, gone. You become new. All is good, and you are forgiven.’\nJesus transformed many people by forgiving them. That was one of the accusations against him – that he forgives people. Who is he to forgive? Somebody has committed a sin – the society has to punish him! and if the society cannot punish and the man escapes, then the society has prepared a punishment through God – he should be thrown in hell.\nHindus also are very much against the idea that Jesus can forgive you. The Christian idea is immense, tremendous, very great and potential. Hindus say that you will have to suffer for your past KARMAS, whatsoever you have done, you will have to undo. If you have done a bad thing you will have to do a good thing. And the bad and its result are going to come: you will have to suffer the consequence. Hindus will not agree with this. Neither will agree the Buddhists, nor the Jains, nor were Jews agreeing with Jesus. How can he forgive?\nBut I say to you: a man of that understanding can forgive. Not that by his forgiving are you forgiven. But just if that consciousness, that great consciousness can give you a feel of well-being – ‘Nothing is wrong, don’t be worried; you can just shake off the past like dust and get out of it’ – that very thing will give you such courage, such enthusiasm, will open new possibilities and new doors. And you are freed from it. You immediately move beyond it.\nFrom this came the idea of Christian confession. It does not work that way, because the man you go to confess to is an ordinary man just like you. When you are confessing, the priest is not really forgiving you, he may be condemning deep down. His forgiveness is just a show. He is an ordinary man, he has no higher consciousness than you. Only from the higher can forgiveness flow. Only from the high mountains can the rivers flow towards the plains. Only from a Jesus or a Buddha, can forgiveness flow. And when there is a man like Jesus or Buddha, just his touch, just his look is enough to forgive you your whole past and all your KARMAS.\nI TOTALLY agree with Jesus. He brings a new vision to humanity: to attain to freedom. The Hindu, the Jain, the Buddhist concept is very ordinary and mathematical. It has no magic in it. It is very logical but it has no love in it. Jesus brings love to the world.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"11008","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/i_say_unto_you_vol_2/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/i_say_unto_you_vol_2/>I Say Unto You, Vol 2</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">1 Neither do I condemn thee</h1><div class=post-meta>52 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;11008 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/I_Say_Unto_You_Vol_2/part1.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

THE PEOPLE CAME UNTO HIM; AND HE SAT DOWN, AND TAUGHT THEM.</p><p><br></p><p>3. AND THE SCRIBES AND PHARISEES BROUGHT UNTO HIM A WOMAN TAKEN IN

CONDEMN THEE: GO, AND SIN NO MORE.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion always deteriorates into morality. Morality is dead
religion. Religion is alive morality. They never meet, they cannot meet.
because life and death never meet light and darkness never meet. But the
problem is that they look very alike – the corpse looks very like the
living man. Everything is just like when the man was alive: the same
face, the same eyes, the same nose, the hair, the body. Just one thing
is missing, and that one thing is invisible.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is missing, but life is not tangible and not visible. So when a
man is dead, he looks as if he is still alive. And with the problem of
morality, it becomes more complex.</p><p><br></p><p>Morality looks exactly like religion, but it is not. It is a corpse:
it stinks of death. Religion is youth, religion is freshness – the
freshness of the flowers and the freshness of the morning dew. Religion
is splendour – the splendour of the stars, of life, of existence itself.
When religion is there, there is no morality at all and the person is
moral. But there is no morality; there is no idea of what morality is.
It is just natural; it follows you as your shadow follows you. You need
not carry your shadow, you need not think about your shadow. You need
not look back again and again and see whether the shadow is following
you still or not. It follows.</p><p><br></p><p>Just like that, morality follows a religious person. He never
considers it, he never deliberately thinks about it; it is his natural
flavour. But when religion is dead, when life has disappeared, then one
starts thinking about morality continuously. Consciousness has
disappeared, and conscience becomes the only shelter.</p><p><br></p><p>Conscience is a pseudo phenomenon. Consciousness is yours, conscience
is borrowed. Conscience is of the society of the collective mind; it
does not arise in your own being. When you are conscious you act rightly
because your act is conscious, and the conscious act can never go wrong.
When your eyes are fully open and there is light, you don’t try to get
through the wall, you go through the door. When there is no light and
your eyes are also not functioning well, naturally you grope in the
dark. You have to think a thousand and one times where the door is – ’To
the left, to the right? Am I moving in the right direction? And you
stumble upon the furniture, and you try to get out through the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>A religious person is one who has eyes to see, who has awareness. In
that awareness actions are naturally good. Let me repeat: naturally
good. Not that you manage them to be good. Managed goodness is not
goodness at all. It is pseudo, it is pretension, it is hypocrisy. When
goodness is natural, spontaneous, just as trees are green and the sky is
blue, so is the religious man moral – completely unaware of his
morality. Aware of himself but unaware of his morality, he has no idea
that</p><p>he is moral, that he is good, that what he is doing is right. Out of
his awareness comes innocence, out of his awareness comes the right act
– of its own accord. It has not to be brought, it has not to be
cultivated, it has not to be practised. Then morality has a beauty, but
it is no more morality; it is simply moral. In fact, it is just a
religious way of living.</p><p><br></p><p>But when religion has disappeared, then you have to manage it. Then
you have to constantly think about what is right and what is wrong. And
how are you going to decide what is right and what is wrong? You don’t
have your own eyes to see, you don’t have your own heart to feel. You
are dead and dull. YoU don’t have your own intelligence to go into
matters, then you have to depend on the collective mind that surrounds
you.</p><p><br></p><p>Religiousness has one flavour – whether you are Christian or Hindu or
Mohammedan does not make any difference. A religious person is simply
religious. He is neither Hindu nor Mohammedan nor Christian. But a moral
person is not just moral. Either he is Hindu or Christian or Mohammedan
or Buddhist, because morality has to be learnt from the outside. If you
are born in a Buddhist country, in a Buddhist society, you will learn
the Buddhist morality. If you are born in a Christian world, you will
learn the Christian morality. You will learn from others. and you HAVE
to learn from others because you don t have your own insight. So
morality is borrowed; it is social, it is mob – it comes from the
masses.</p><p><br></p><p>And from where does it come to the masses? – from tradition. They
have heard what is right and what is wrong, and they have carried it
down the ages. It is being given from one generation to another. Nobody
bothers whether it is a corpse, nobody bothers whether the heart beats
still; it goes on being given from one generation to another. It is
dull, dead, heavy; it kills joy, it is a killjoy. It kills celebration,
it kills laughter, it makes people ugly, it makes people heavy,
monotonous, boring. But it has a long tradition.</p><p><br></p><p>Another thing to be remembered: religion is always born anew. In
Jesus, religion is born again. It is not the same religion that was with
Moses. It has not come from Moses. It has no continuity with the past;
it is utterly discontinuous with the past.</p><p><br></p><p>It arises again and again just like a flower comes on the rose bush.
It has nothing to do with the flowers that had come before on the rose
bush. It is discontinuous. It comes on its own; it has no past, no
history, no biography. For the moment it is there, and for the moment it
is so beautifully there, so authentically there. For the moment it is so
strong, so alive, and yet so fragile. In the morning sun it was so
young... by the evening it will be gone, the petals will start falling
down into the earth from which they had come in the first place. And it
will not leave any trace behind: if you come the next day, it is no more
there. And it has not left any marks; it has simply disappeared. As it
has come out of nothingness, so it has gone back to nothingness, to the
original source .</p><p><br></p><p>Just like that is religion. When it happens in a Buddha, it is fresh,
young, like a rose flower. Then it disappears, it leaves no traces.
Buddha has said ‘Religion is like a bird flying in the sky, it leaves no
foot-marks.’ Then it happens in a Moses – it is fresh, young again. then
in Jesus – it is fresh and young again. And when it will happen to you,
it will not have any continuity, it will not come from somebody else –
Christ, Buddha, me; it will not come from anybody else. It will ARISE in
you, it will bloom in you. It will be a flowering of your being, and
then it will be gone. You cannot give it to anybody; it is not
transferable. It cannot be given, cannot be borrowed; it is not a
thing.</p><p>Yes, if somebody wants to learn, it can be learnt. If somebody wants
to imbibe, it can be imbibed. When a disciple learns around a Master,
absorbs the vibes of the Master, then too it is something that is
happening within him. Maybe he gets the challenge, the provocation, the
call from the outside, but that which arises, arises in him, utterly in
him; it does not come from the outside. It may be like you are not aware
that you can sing; you have never tried, you have never thought about
the possibility. Then one day you see a singer, and suddenly his song
starts pulsating around you, and in a moment of awakening you become
aware that you have also got a throat and a heart. And now, suddenly,
for the first time, you become also aware that there has been a song
hidden in you, and you release it. But the song comes from your
innermost core, it arises from your being. Maybe the provocation, the
call came from the outside, but not the song.</p><p><br></p><p>So the Master is a catalytic agent. His presence provokes something
in you, his presence does not function as a cause.</p><p><br></p><p>C.G. Jung is right in bringing a new concept to the Western world. It
has existed in the East for centuries – the concept of synchronicity.
There are things which happen as cause and effect, and there are things
which don’t happen as cause and effect, but just by synchronicity. This
idea has to be understood, because this idea will help you to understand
the difference between morality and religion.</p><p><br></p><p>Morality is cause and effect. Your father, your mother have taught
you something: they function as the cause, and then the effect goes on
continuing in you. Then you will teach your children: you will become
the cause, and the effect will continue in your children. But listening
to a singer, suddenly you start humming a tune. There is no
cause-and-effect relationship. The singer is not the cause, and you are
not the effect. You have caused the effect yourself – you are both the
cause and the effect. The singer functioned only as a remembrance, the
singer functioned only as a catalytic agent.</p><p><br></p><p>What has happened to me I cannot give to you. Not that I don’t want
to give it to you, no – because it cannot be given, its very nature is
such that it cannot be given – but I can present it to you, I can make
it available to you. Seeing that it is possible, seeing that it has
happened to another man, ‘Why not to me?’ suddenly something clicks
inside you, you become alert to a possibility, alert to a door that is
in you but you were never looking at, you had forgotten it. And
something starts sprouting in you.</p><p><br></p><p>I function as a catalytic agent not as a cause. The concept of
synchronicity simply says that one thing can start something somewhere
without it being a cause. It says that if somebody plays sitar in a room
where another sitar has been placed in the corner, and if the player is
really a master, a maestro, the sitar that is just sitting there in the
corner will start throbbing – because of the other sitar being played in
the room, the vibe, the whole milieu. And the sitar that is just sitting
there in the corner – nobody is playing it, nobody is touching it – you
can see its strings vibrating, whispering. Something that is hidden is
surfacing, something that was not manifest is manifesting.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is synchronicity; morality is causal. Morality comes from
the outside, religion arises in you. When religion disappears there is
only morality, and morality is very dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>First, you don’t know yourself what is right, but you start
pretending: the hypocrite is created. You start pretending, you start
showing that whatsoever you are doing is right. You don’t know what</p><p>right is, and naturally, because you don’t know you can only pretend.
From the back door you will continue doing the same: that you KNOW it is
right. From the back door you will have one life, from the front door,
another. From the front door you may be smiling, and from the back door
you may be crying and weeping. From the front door you will pretend to
be a saint, and from the back door you will be as much of a sinner as
anybody else. Your life will become split. This is what is creating
schizophrenia in the whole human consciousness. You become two, or
many.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally when you are two, there is constant conflict. Naturally
when you are many, there is a crowd and much noise, and you can never
settle in silence, you can never rest in silence. Silence is possible
only when you are one, when there is nobody else within you, when you
are one piece – not fragmented.</p><p><br></p><p>Morality creates schizophrenia, split personalities, divisions. A
moral person is not an individual because he is divided. Only a
religious person is an individual. The moral person has a personality
but no individuality. Personality means PERSONA, mask. And he has many
personalities, not just one, because he has to have many personalities
around him. In different situations, different personalities are needed.
With different people, different personalities are needed. To one he
shows one face, to another he shows another face. One goes on changing
faces.</p><p><br></p><p>Watch, and you will see how you go on changing faces every moment.
Alone you have one face. In your bathroom you have one face, in the
office you have another. Have you observed the fact that in your
bathroom you become more childish? Sometimes you can show your tongue to
yourself in the mirror, or you can make faces, or you can hum a tune,
sing a song, or you can even have a little dance in the bathroom. But
while you are dancing or showing your tongue in the mirror, if you
become aware that your child is looking through the keyhole, you change
– immediate change! The old face comes back... the father personality.
‘This cannot be done in front of the child’ otherwise what will he
think? – that you are also like him? So what about that seriousness that
you show to him always? You immediately pull down another face; you
become serious. The song disappears, the dance disappears, the tongue
disappears. You are back into your so-called front-door personality.</p><p><br></p><p>Morality creates conflict in you because it creates many faces. And
the problem is that when you have many faces, you tend to forget which
is your original one. With so many faces how can you remember which is
your original one?</p><p><br></p><p>The Zen Masters say the first thing for a seeker to know is his
original face, because only then can something start. Only the original
face can grow, a mask cannot grow. A false face can have no growth.
Growth is possible only for the original face, because only the original
has life.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing is to know ‘What is my original face?’ and it is
arduous, because there is a long queue of false faces, and you are lost
in your false faces. And sometimes you may think ‘This is my original
face.’ If you go deep into it, you will find this again is a false face,
maybe it is more ancient than the others, so it looks more original.</p><p><br></p><p>The Zen Masters say: If you really want to see your original face,
you will have to go before birth, you will have to conceive of what your
face was before you were born, or what your face will be when you are
dead.</p><p>Between birth and death you have all kinds of false faces. Even a
small child starts learning the pseudo tricks, diplomacies. Just a small
child – maybe one day old, just out of the womb – starts learning,
because he sees that if he smiles, then mother feels very good. If he
smiles the mother immediately gives her breast to him. If he smiles, the
mother comes close, hugs him, pats him. He has learned a trick, that if
he wants the mother to be close to him, if he wants to be hugged and
kissed and talked to, he has to smile. Now the diplomat is born, the
politician is born. Whenever he wants the mother to pull him close... He
cannot call, he cannot talk, but he can wait until she looks at him then
he can smile. The moment he smiles, the mother comes running. Now
whether he feels like smiling in this moment or not is not the point, he
wants the mother, he wants to manipulate the mother. He has a trick, a
strategy, a technique which he has learned: smile, and mother comes.
Then he will go on smiling, and whenever he wants somebody to come
close, he will smile. And this face will not be the true face.</p><p><br></p><p>Your smiles are not true. Your tears are also not true. Your whole
personality is synthetic, plastic. The moral person, the so-called
moralist, has many personalities but no individuality. The religious
person has individuality but no personality. He is one. His taste is
always one.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha is reported to have said: Taste me from anywhere and you will
find the same taste as when you taste the sea. From this side, from that
side, from this shore, from that shore – taste the sea from anywhere and
it is salty. And Buddha says: So is my taste. Taste me while I am
asleep, taste me while I am awake, taste me when somebody is insulting
me, taste me when somebody is praising me – you will always find the
same taste, the taste of a Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>The religious person is an individual.</p><p><br></p><p>The second thing to be remembered: the moralist is always making
efforts to impose his morality on others – for many reasons. First: he
uses his morality to manipulate himself. Naturally, he does the same to
others; he starts using his morality to manipulate others. He uses
morality for his own strategies, diplomacies. Naturally, he learns a
trick: that if he can enforce his morality on others, then things will
be easier.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, if the moralist speaks the truth, his truth is not very
deep. Deep down there are only lies and lies. But at least in society he
pretends to speak the truth. He will try to impose his truth on others
also. He would like everybody else to speak the truth, because he will
be very much afraid that if somebody lies and tricks him, deceives
him... And he knows that he himself is Lying and deceiving people in
subtle words, but on the surface he keeps the truth. And he goes on
shouting ‘Everybody should be true!’ He is very much afraid. He knows
that just as he is deceiving others, others may be deceiving him.</p><p><br></p><p>Bertrand Russell has said that thieves are always against stealing. A
thief has to be against stealing, otherwise somebody will steal things
from him. And he has been making so much effort to steal things from
others that if others steal things from him, then what will be the
point? A thief will always shout ‘Stealing is bad! Never steal! You will
be thrown into hell!’ So nobody steals, then the thief is free to
steal.</p><p><br></p><p>If nobody speaks untruths, then you can speak untruths and exploit
people easily. If everybody speaks untruths, how can you exploit? Just
think: a society where everybody speaks untruths, and</p><p>it is an accepted phenomenon that everybody tells lies. Then you will
be at a loss – you will not be able to cheat people. Whatsoever you say,
people will think you are a liar – ‘Everybody tells lies here’; nobody
can be deceived. So, in his own interest, the liar has to go on
preaching morality. ‘Speak the truth, never steal, do this, do that’ –
and from the back door he goes on doing just the opposite. This has to
be understood.</p><p><br></p><p>If somebody’s pocket is picked right now – somebody steals – then
many will be there shouting ‘Catch the thief! Kill the thief! Who is
there?’ And many will shout. Remember, the shouters are just showing one
thing: that they are also thieves. By shouting they are showing many
things. One thing is: ‘Remember, I am not the thief, because I am so
much against. Nobody should ever think or suspect me because I am
against all of this kind of thing. I am a moral person.’ Those who are
pickpockets will shout more, and if the real pickpocket is caught, then
the pickpockets will beat him to show everybody that they are very much
against it.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a very very complex phenomenon. A religious person is a
totally different person. He will be able to forgive, he will be able to
understand. He will be able to see the limitations of man and the
problems of man. He will not be so hard and so cruel – he cannot be. His
compassion will be infinite.</p><p><br></p><p>Before we enter into these sutras, a few things have to be
understood.</p><p><br></p><p>First: the concept of sin, the concept of the immoral act. What is
immoral? How should we define immorality? and what is the criterion? One
thing is immoral in India, another thing is immoral in China. That which
is immoral in India may be moral in Iran, and that which is moral in
Russia may be immoral in India. There are a thousand and one moralities.
How to decide? – because now that the world has become a global village,
there is much confusion. What is right?</p><p><br></p><p>To eat meat is right? Is it moral or immoral? The vegetarian says it
is immoral. Many Jains have come to me many times and said ‘What about
Jesus eating meat? How can Jesus be an enlightened person – and you say
that he is enlightened – how can he be an enlightened person? He cats
meat.’ For a Jain it is impossible to conceive that Jesus can be
enlightened although he eats meat. Jains have come to me and said to me
‘How can Ramakrishna be enlightened? He eats fish. He cannot be.’ Now
they have a very definite criterion with them – vegetarianism.</p><p><br></p><p>One Jain monk was talking to me, and he said ‘I cannot believe that
Jesus or Ramakrishna are enlightened, they eat meat.’</p><p><br></p><p>I told him ‘Do you know that there are people in the world who think
that to drink milk is almost like eating meat? – because it is an animal
food. Now, milk is an animal food. It is almost like blood because it
comes out of the mother’s blood. It is also full of live bacteria. There
are people in the world, real fanatics, who take things to the very
extreme. They say that milk, cheese, and butter are all animal foods –
they have to be avoided.’</p><p><br></p><p>I asked the Jain monk ‘Mahavir used to drink milk. What do you say?
He was drinking an animal food. Was he enlightened or not? Now Indian
scriptures say milk is the purest food – SATTVIKA – the MOST PURE food
is milk. It is not. It is an animal food!’</p><p>That Jain monk started perspiring when he heard that milk is an
animal food. And he said ‘What are you talking about? Milk is the
SATTVIK food, the purest food!’</p><p><br></p><p>But I said ‘This is the analysis, the scientific analysis. Prove it
wrong. That’s why when you drink too much milk your face starts becoming
red: milk creates blood – it becomes blood in you. That’s why milk is so
vital. And milk is a hundred per cent food, that’s why children live
only on milk. It supplies everything. It becomes blood, it becomes your
flesh, it becomes your skin, your bone, your marrow; it becomes
everything. It is pure animal food. Now how to decide who is right?’</p><p><br></p><p>There are a thousand and one moralities. If you go on deciding, you
will be in difficulty; it will be impossible for you. You will go mad,
you will not be able to eat, you will not be able to sleep, you will not
be able to do anything!</p><p><br></p><p>Now, there is a Jain sect which is afraid of breathing. To breathe is
immoral, because with each breath you kill many many small cells living
around you in the air. They are true. That’s why the doctor has to use a
mask, so that he does not go on inhaling things which are moving around
– infections. That Jain sect is afraid to breathe. Breathing becomes
immoral.</p><p><br></p><p>Walking becomes immoral – there are Jains who don’t walk in the night
because they may kill something, an ant or something, in the darkness.
Mahavir never moved in the night, never moved in the rainy season
because then there are many more insects around. Movement becomes
difficult, breathing becomes difficult. If you go on looking around at
all the moralities, you will simply go crazy or you will have to commit
suicide. But to commit suicide is immoral!</p><p><br></p><p>If you listen to all kinds of moralities that seems to be the logical
thing: just commit suicide. That seems to be the least immoral thing.
One act and you are finished, then there will be no immorality. But that
too is immoral. And when you commit suicide you are not dying alone,
remember. It is not killing one person. You have millions of cells in
the body which are alive, millions of lives inside you, which will die
with you. So you have killed millions of people. When you fast, is it
moral or immoral?</p><p><br></p><p>There are people who say to fast is moral, and there are people who
say to fast is immoral. Why? – because when you fast you kill many cells
inside, because they die of starvation. If you fast, then one kilo in
weight disappears every day. You are killing many things inside you. One
kilo in weight disappears every day. Within a month you will be just a
structure of bones. All those people who used to live inside you – small
people – they have all died. You have killed all of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Or there are people who say to fast is like eating meat. Mow... very
strange. And that is true, there is a logic to it. When one kilo in
weight disappears, where has it gone? You have eaten it! Your body needs
that kind of food every day. You go on replacing it with outside food.
If you don’t replace it with outside food... the body goes on eating
because the body needs; for twenty-four hours, the body has to live. It
needs a certain fuel. Then it starts eating its own flesh. To be on a
fast is to be a cannibal.</p><p><br></p><p>These moralities can drive you mad! There is no way to choose. Then
what is moral to me? To be aware is moral. What you are doing is not the
question. If you are doing it in full awareness, then whatsoever it is –
it is irrelevant what it is – irrespective of the fact of what it is, if
you are doing in full awareness, it is moral. If you are doing unawares,
unconscious, then it is immoral.</p><p>To me, morality means awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>The French language seems to be the only language which has only one
word for two words: conscience and consciousness. That seems to be very
very beautiful. Consciousness is conscience. Ordinarily, consciousness
is one thing and conscience is another thing. Consciousness is yours.
Conscience is given to you by others: it is a conditioning.</p><p><br></p><p>Live by consciousness, become more and more conscious, and you will
become more and more moral – and you will not become a moralist. You
will become moral, and you will not become a moralist. The moralist is
an ugly phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the sutras:</p><p><br></p><p>JESUS WENT UNTO THE MOUNT OF OLIVES.</p><p><br></p><p>He always used to go to the mountains whenever he would feel that his
consciousness was becoming dusty, his mirror was covered with dust. He
would go to the mountains in aloneness to cleanse his being, to cleanse
his consciousness. It is like you take a bath, and after the bath you
feel the body is fresh, young.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is like an inner bath. To be alone for a few moments every
day is a must; otherwise you will gather too much dust, and because of
that dust your mirror will not reflect any more, or will not reflect
rightly. It may start distorting things.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you not watched? A single dust particle goes in your eye, and
your vision becomes distorted. The same is true about the inner vision –
the inner eye – so much dust goes on collecting, and dust comes from
relationship. Just as when you travel on a dusty road, you collect dust;
when you move with people who are dusty, you collect dust. They are all
throwing their dust all around, they are all throwing wrong vibes – and
they cannot do anything, they are helpless. I am not saying that you
condemn them. What can they do?</p><p><br></p><p>If you go to a hospital and everybody is ill in the hospital, and if
they are throwing their infections all around – they can’t help it. They
breathe and the infection goes out. Have you not seen it when you go to
the hospital to see somebody? Just one hour in the hospital and you
start feeling a kind of sickness, and you had come perfectly healthy?
Just the smell of the hospital, just the faces of the nurses and the
doctors, and the medical instruments, and that particular hospital
smell, and people who are all ill, and the whole vibe of illness and
death always there... somebody is always dying.</p><p><br></p><p>Just one hour there and you feel very low; a kind of nausea arises in
you.</p><p><br></p><p>Coming out of the hospital you feel a great relief. The same is the
situation in the world. You don’t know because you live in the world.
The nurse who goes on working in the hospital, and the doctor who goes
on working in the hospital – they have to become insensitive, otherwise
they would die. They would not be able to live there. They have become
insensitive; they go on moving. That’s why many times you see doctors
looking very very insensitive – that is their protection. The patient
goes on saying that this is wrong and that is wrong, and the doctor
stands there almost not listening. The relatives of the patient go on
running after the doctor and go on telling him that this</p><p>is going wrong and that is... And he says ‘Everything will be okay. I
will come tomorrow morning. When I come on my round, I will see.’ Now
you are feeling so concerned, and he seems to be absolutely unconcerned.
This is just to protect himself. If he becomes too sensitive, he will
not be able to survive. He has to become hard, he has to create a kind
of stoniness around himself. That stoniness will protect him – will
protect him from the hospital and the patients and the whole atmosphere.
Doctors become hard, insensitive; nurses become hard, insensitive.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is happening in the world at large. It is a kind of big
hospital, because everybody is ill here and everybody is on the
deathbed; and everybody is full of anger and violence and aggression and
jealousy and possessiveness; and everybody is false, pseudo, and
everybody is a hypocrite – this is the world. You don’t feel it, but
when a Jesus moves amidst you, he feels it because he comes from the
heights. He descends from the mountains.</p><p><br></p><p>If you go to the Himalayas and after living few days in the Himalayan
freshness you come back to the plains, then you feel how dusty, how
ugly, how heavy the vibe is. Now you have comparison. You have seen the
fresh waters of the Himalayas – those fresh fountains running forever,
and the crystal-clear water – and then the municipal tap water. You have
the comparison then. Only a meditator knows that the world is ill, only
a meditator feels that everything is wrong here. And when a meditator
moves amidst you, naturally he feels much more dust collecting on
himself than you can feel, because you have lost all sensitivity.</p><p><br></p><p>You have forgotten that you are.a mirror! You know that you are just
a dust collector. Only a meditator knows that he is a mirror.</p><p><br></p><p>So Jesus goes again and again to the mountains. JESUS WENT...</p><p>unto the mountains</p><p><br></p><p>... UNTO THE MOUNT OF OLIVES. AND EARLY IN THE MORNING HE CAME AGAIN
INTO THE TEMPLE, AND ALL THE PEOPLE CAME UNTO HIM; AND HE SAT DOWN, AND
TAUGHT THEM.</p><p><br></p><p>AND EARLY IN THE MORNING HE CAME... INTO THE TEMPLE...</p><p><br></p><p>Only when you have been to the mountains – and that does not mean
that you really have to go to the mountains. It is not an outer
phenomenon. The mount is within you. If you can be alone, if you can
forget the whole world for a few seconds, you will regain your
freshness. And only then can you go to the temple, because only then you
ARE a temple. And only then will your presence in the temple be a real
presence; and there will be a harmony between you and the temple
Remember, unless you bring your temple to the temple, there is no
temple. If you simply go to the temple, and don’t bring your temple
there within you, it is just a house.</p><p><br></p><p>When Jesus goes into a house, it becomes a temple. When you go into a
temple. it becomes a house – because we carry our own temples inside.
Wherever Jesus goes it becomes a temple, his presence creates that
sacred quality. And only when you bring the temple and the freshness of
the mountains, and the virginity of the mountains, only then can you
teach. You can teach only THEN, when you HAVE it.</p><p>AND EARLY IN THE MORNING HE CAME AGAIN INTO THE TEMPLE, AND ALL THE
PEOPLE CAME UNTO HIM; AND HE SAT DOWN, AND TAUGHT THEM.</p><p><br></p><p>AND THE SCRIBES AND PHARISEES BROUGHT UNTO HIM A WOMAN TAKEN IN
ADULTERY; AND WHEN THEY HAD SET HER IN THE MIDST,</p><p><br></p><p>THEY SAID UNTO HIM, MASTER, THIS WOMAN WAS TAKEN IN ADULTERY, IN THE
VERY ACT.</p><p><br></p><p>NOW MOSES IN THE LAW COMMANDED US, THAT SUCH SHOULD BE STONED: BUT
WHAT SAYEST THOU?</p><p><br></p><p>This is one of the most important parables in Jesus’ life. Go into it
slowly, delicately, carefully. AND THE SCRIBES AND PHARISEES...</p><p>Now for that you can read ‘the moralists and the puritans’. In those
days those were the names of the moralists, the pundits, the scholars –
‘the scribes and the Pharisees’. The Pharisees were the people who were
very respectable. On their surfaces very moral, pretentious, with great
egos. ‘We are moral and everybody else is immoral’ – and always
searching and looking into people’s faults. Their whole life is
concerned with that: how to exaggerate their own qualities and how to
reduce others’ qualities to nil.</p><p><br></p><p>The puritans, the moralists</p><p><br></p><p>... BROUGHT UNTO HIM A WOMAN TAKEN IN ADULTERY,</p><p><br></p><p>Now when you come to a man like Jesus, you have to come there in
humbleness, you have to come there imbibe something from Jesus; it is a
rare opportunity. And now here come these fools and they bring a woman.
They bring their ordinary mind, their mediocre mind, their stupidities
with them.</p><p><br></p><p>AND THE SCRIBES AND PHARISEES BROUGHT UNTO HIM A WOMAN TAKEN IN
ADULTERY...</p><p><br></p><p>They have not learnt even this simple lesson that when you go to a
man like Jesus or Buddha, you go to partake, to participate in his
consciousness: you go to become intimate with him. You don’t bring the
ordinary problems of life there; they are irrelevant. That will be
wasting a great opportunity, that will be wasting Jesus’ time. And he
had not much time, as I told you before – only three years of ministry.
And these fools were wasting like this... But they had a certain
strategy in it: it was a trap.</p><p><br></p><p>They were not really concerned with the woman. They were creating a
trap for Jesus. It was a very diplomatic act.</p><p><br></p><p>AND THE SCRIBES AND PHARISEES BROUGHT UNTO HIM A WOMAN TAKEN IN
ADULTERY; AND WHEN THEY HAD SET HER IN THE MIDST, THEY SAID UNTO HIM,
MASTER, THIS WOMAN WAS TAKEN IN ADULTERY, IN THE VERY ACT.</p><p><br></p><p>Now what is adultery?</p><p>A conscious mind will say if you don’t love a man – maybe the man is
your own husband – if you don’t love the man and you sleep with the man,
it is adultery. If you don’t love the woman – and she may be your own
wife – if you don’t love her and you sleep with her, you are exploiting
her, you are deceiving her. It is adultery.</p><p><br></p><p>But that is not the definition of the Pharisees and the puritans and
the scribes and the pundits. their definition is legal, their definition
does not arise out of consciousness or love. Their definition arises out
of the legal court. If the woman is not your wife and you have been
found sleeping with her, it is adultery. It is just a legal matter,
technical. The heart is not taken into account, only the law. You may be
deeply in love with the man or with the woman, but that is not to be
taken into account. The unconscious mind cannot take higher things into
account. He can only take the lowest into account.</p><p><br></p><p>His problem is always legal. Is it YOUR woman? YOUR wife? Are you
legally wed to her? Then it is good, then it is no more sin. If she is
not your woman, you are not legally wed to her... You may be in deep
love, and you may have immense respect for the woman – you may almost be
a worshipper of the woman – but it is sin, it is adultery.</p><p><br></p><p>These people brought this woman to Jesus, and</p><p><br></p><p>THEY SAID UNTO HIM, MASTER, THIS WOMAN WAS TAKEN IN ADULTERY, IN THE
VERY ACT.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I was reading the memoirs of an English Christian
missionary who went to Japan in the early days of this century. He was
taken around Tokyo. His host took him around to show him the city. In
one public bath there were men and women taking their baths in the nude.
The missionary was very much shocked.</p><p><br></p><p>He stood there for five minutes, watched everything, and then he told
his host ‘Is it not immoral – women and men taking baths naked in a
public place?’</p><p><br></p><p>And the host said ‘Sir, this is not immoral in our country, but to
stand here and watch is immoral. Sorry to say’ he said ’but I am feeling
very guilty standing with you, because that is THEIR business if they
want to take a bath naked. That is THEIR freedom. But why are you
standing here? This is ugly, immoral.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the missionary’s standpoint is very ordinary, and the host’s
standpoint is extraordinary. These people say</p><p>MASTER, THIS WOMAN WAS TAKEN IN ADULTERY, IN THE VERY ACT.</p><p><br></p><p>And what were you doing there?</p><p><br></p><p>These were peeping Toms or... what type of people were these? What
were you doing there? Why should you be concerned?</p><p><br></p><p>This woman’s life is her life. How she wants to spend her life is her
concern. Who are you to interfere? But the puritan, the moralist, has
always been interfering in other people’s lives. He is not democratic,
he is very dictatorial. He wants to manipulate people, condemn
people.</p><p>Now what were these people doing there? And they say</p><p>MASTER, THIS WOMAN WAS TAKEN IN ADULTERY, IN THE VERY ACT.</p><p><br></p><p>They have caught the woman while she was making love.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing more: Where is the man? She was doing adultery alone...?
Nobody has ever asked THIS question about this parable. I have read many
Christian books, but nobody has ever asked ‘Where is the man?’</p><p><br></p><p>But it is a man’s society. It is always the woman who is wrong, not
the man. The man will go free perfectly well. He may himself be a
Pharisee, he may himself be a respectable man – but the woman has to be
condemned. Have you not observed it? Prostitutes are condemned, but
where are the prostituters? Where are those people? They may be the same
people who condemn.</p><p><br></p><p>Now Morarji Desai wants to bring prohibition to the country. And in
his own ministry, out of seventeen, twelve are drunkards. Twelve! And he
himself does not drink, that is true, but he drinks his own urine. That
is a far worse case! But he wants to bring prohibition on the country.
He wants to put it through force. Maybe because he has not been
drinking... He wants to take revenge on others, on what?</p><p><br></p><p>Puritans are always ugly people. They don’t live, but then they don’t
allow anybody else to live. Their only joy is how to kill other people’s
joys, how to kill everybody’s celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>Now what were these people doing there? Don’t they have anything else
to do? Don’t they have their own women to love? What kind of people are
these? They must be a little perverted to go out searching and seeking
who is committing adultery. And then where is the man? Just the woman
has to be condemned always.</p><p><br></p><p>Why does the woman have to be condemned? Because the woman is a woman
and the man is the dominant one, and all the legal codes have been made
by men. They are very very prejudicial, biased. All the legal courts say
what should be done to a woman if she is found in adultery, but they
don’t say anything about what should be done to the man. No, they say
‘Boys are boys. And boys will be boys.’ It is always a question of the
woman.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if a man rapes a woman, the woman becomes condemned; she loses
respect not the rapist!</p><p><br></p><p>This is an ugly state of affairs. This can’t be called religious, it
is very political – basically in man’s favour and against woman. And all
your so-called moralities have been that way.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, when a husband used to die, the wife had to go with him to
the funeral pyre, then only was she thought to be virtuous. she had to
become a SATI, she had to die with the husband. If she did not die, that
meant she was not virtuous. That simply meant she wanted to live without
the husband, or maybe she wanted the husband to die, now she wanted
freedom, now she would fall in love with somebody else.</p><p>In India it has been thought then that for the woman there is no life
once the husband is dead. Her husband is her whole life. If the husband
is gone, she has to go. But nothing is said about the man if his woman
dies – no prescription for him that he should die with the woman. No,
that is no problem. Immediately after the woman has died... In India it
happens every day: the people are burning the woman and then coming back
home they start thinking about the new marriage – where the man should
find a new woman, how to find. Not a single day is lost.</p><p><br></p><p>For man the morality is different, for woman it is different. Then it
is a very unconscious morality, and very IMMORAL MORALITY.</p><p><br></p><p>My definition of morality is that of consciousness, and consciousness
is neither man nor woman. Consciousness is just consciousness. Only when
something is decided by your being conscious will it be classless, will
it be beyond the distinctions of body, caste, creed. And only then is it
moral.</p><p><br></p><p>MASTER, they say, THIS WOMAN WAS TAKEN IN ADULTERY, IN THE VERY
ACT.</p><p><br></p><p>NOW MOSES IN THE LAW COMMANDED US, THAT SUCH SHOULD BE STONED: BUT
WHAT SAYEST THOU?</p><p><br></p><p>THIS THEY SAID, TEMPTING HIM, THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO ACCUSE HIM. BUT
JESUS STOOPED DOWN, AND WITH HIS FINGER WROTE ON THE GROUND, AS THOUGH
HE HEARD THEM NOT.</p><p><br></p><p>This w as the trap. They wanted to trap Jesus, because Moses has said
that such a woman should be stoned. Nothing is said about the man. Such
a woman should be stoned to death: Moses has said this. Now they are
creating a problem for Jesus. If Jesus says ‘Yes, do as Moses says’ then
they can accuse him, because he has always been talking about love,
compassion, kindness, forgiveness. Then they can say ‘What about your
compassion? What about your forgiveness? What about your love? You say
this woman has to be killed by stones? This is hard and cruel and
violent.’</p><p><br></p><p>Tricky fellows.</p><p><br></p><p>And if Jesus says ‘This is not right. Moses is not right’ then they
can say ‘So you have come to destroy Moses? So you have come to destroy
and corrupt our religion? And you have been saying to people “I have
come not to destroy but to fulfil.” What about that? If you have come to
fulfil, then follow Moses’ law!’ Now they are creating a dilemma. This
is the trap. They are not much concerned about the woman, remember,
their REAL target is Jesus; the woman is just an excuse. And they have
brought such a case... That’s why they say IN THE VERY ACT, red-handed.
So it is not a question of deciding whether the woman has really
committed adultery. Otherwise, Jesus will have an excuse to get out. He
will say ‘First, try to find out whether REALLY it has happened. Bring
the witnesses. Let it first be decided.’ Then it will take years. So
they say ‘Red-handed! We have caught her in the very act. We are all the
witnesses, so there is no question of deciding anything else. And the
law is clear: Moses has said that such should be stoned.’</p><p><br></p><p>... BUT WHAT SAYEST THOU?</p><p><br></p><p>’Do you agree with Moses? If you agree, then what about your love and
compassion – your whole message? If you don’t agree, then what do you
mean when you say “I have come to fulfil”? Then</p><p>you have come to destroy Moses’ law. So do you think you are higher
than Moses? Do you think that you know more than Moses?’</p><p><br></p><p>... BUT WHAT SAYEST THOU? THIS THEY SAID, TEMPTING HIM, THAT THEY
MIGHT HAVE TO ACCUSE HIM. BUT JESUS STOOPED DOWN, AND WITH HIS.FINGER
WROTE ON THE GROUND, AS THOUGH HE HEARD THEM NOT.</p><p><br></p><p>Why? Why did Jesus stoop down? Why did he start writing on the
ground?</p><p><br></p><p>They were just on the bank of a river. Jesus was sitting in the sand.
Why has he started writing on the sand? What has happened?</p><p><br></p><p>There is one thing to be understood: it is always a delicate problem.
For example, if I see something stated by Buddha as wrong, there is a
great hesitation to say that he is wrong. He cannot be wrong. Tradition
must have misinterpreted him. Something must have been wrongly put into
his mouth. Buddha cannot be wrong. But now there is no way to decide,
because the scriptures say this clearly...</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus hesitating., .Jesus is concerned. He does not want to say a
single word against Moses, but he has to say, hence the hesitation. He
does not want to say anything against Moses because Moses CANNOT say it
that way. It is his inner feeling that Moses cannot say it that way. But
the inner feeling cannot be decisive. These people will say ‘Who are
you? And why should we care about your inner feeling? We have the
written code with us, given by our forefathers. It is there written
clearly!’</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus does not want to say anything against Moses, because he REALLY
has come to fulfil Moses. Anybody who becomes enlightened in the world
is always fulfilling all the enlightened ones that have preceded him.
Even if sometimes he says something against them, then, too, he is
fulfilling them, because he cannot say anything against them. And if you
feel that he is saying something against them, then he is saying
something against the tradition, against the scripture. But that looks
like saying something against Moses, against Buddha, against Abraham.
Hence, he stoops down. He starts looking at the sand and then starts
writing. He is puzzled about what to do. He has to find a way out.</p><p><br></p><p>He has to find the way out in such a way that he has not to say
anything against Moses, and YET he cancels the whole law. And he really
comes with a very very miraculous answer, a magical answer.</p><p><br></p><p>SO WHEN THEY CONTINUED ASKING HIM, HE LIFTED UP HIMSELF, AND SAID
UNTO THEM, HE THAT IS WITHOUT SIN AMONG YOU, LET HIM FIRST CAST A STONE
AT HER.</p><p><br></p><p>It is really incredible, it is beautiful – that was his hesitation.
He has found a golden mean. He has not said a single word against Moses
and he has not supported Moses either. This is the delicate point to
understand.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was really utterly intelligent – uneducated, but utterly
intelligent, a man of immense awareness. That’s the only reason why he
could find the way out.</p><p><br></p><p>He says</p><p>HE THAT IS WITHOUT SIN AMONG YOU...</p><p><br></p><p>He says ‘Perfectly right’ does not say directly that Moses is right.
but he says ‘Perfectly right. If Moses says so, then it must be so. But
then, who should start throwing stones at this woman?’</p><p><br></p><p>HE THAT IS WITHOUT SIN AMONG YOU, LET HIM FIRST CAST A STONE AT
HER.</p><p><br></p><p>‘So start, but only those who are without sin...’</p><p><br></p><p>Now this is a new thing that Jesus brings in. You can judge only if
you are without sin. You can punish only if you are without sin. If you
are also in the same boat, then what is the point? Then who is going to
punish whom?</p><p><br></p><p>AND AGAIN HE STOOPED DOWN, AND WROTE ON THE GROUND.</p><p><br></p><p>Why did he stoop down again? Because he must have been afraid; some
foolish person is always possible. He knows that everybody has committed
one sin or other. If they have not committed, then they have been
thinking to commit – which is almost the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Whether you think or you act makes no difference. Remember, the
difference between sin and crime is this: Crime has to be acted out,
only then is it crime. You can go on thinking, but if you don’t commit
it to action, no court can punish you because it never becomes a crime.
And only crime is within the jurisdiction of the court, not sin. Then
what is sin? Sin is if you think ‘I would like to murder this man.’ No
court can do anything. You can say ‘Yes, I have been thinking of it my
whole life’ – but thinking is beyond the court’s jurisdiction. You are
allowed to think. No court can punish you because you dreamt that you
killed somebody. You can dream every day, and you can go on killing as
many people as you want. No court can catch hold of you unless it comes
to actuality, unless thought becomes deed, unless thought is translated
into reality. If it comes out of you and affects society, then it
becomes crime. But it is sin, because God can go on reading your
thoughts. There is no need for him to read your acts. The magistrate has
to read your acts, he cannot read your thoughts; he is not a
thought-reader or a mind-reader.</p><p><br></p><p>But for God there is no difference; whether you think or you do, it
is all the same. The moment you think, you have done it.</p><p><br></p><p>So Jesus says HE THAT IS WITHOUT SIN AMONG YOU... not without crime.
He says HE THAT IS WITHOUT SIN AMONG YOU, LET HIM.FIRST CAST A STONE AT
HER. That distinction was</p><p>known down the ages: that if you think it, you have committed a sin
already. AND AGAIN HE STOOPED DOWN...</p><p>Why this time? – because if he goes on looking at people. his very
look may be provocative. If he goes on looking at people then somebody,
just from his look and out of his offense may throw a stone at the poor
woman. He does not want to offend; he withdraws. He simply stoops down,
starts writing in the sand-again as if he is not there. He becomes
absent, because his presence can be dangerous. If they have come just to
trap him, and he is there and they feel his presence, it will be
difficult for them to feel their own consciences, their own
consciousnesses. He withdraws into</p><p>himself, he allows them total freedom to think about it. He does not
interfere; his presence can be an interference. If he goes on looking at
them, that will be offensive to their egos. And it will be difficult for
them to escape also, because then it will feel bad that somebody was
standing just in front of the mayor of the town or somebody – the
respectable people... and how can the mayor escape when Jesus is
looking? And if he escapes and does not throw the stone at the woman, it
will be a proof that he is a sinner.</p><p><br></p><p>He stoops down again, starts writing on the sand, gives them a chance
– if they want to escape they can escape.</p><p><br></p><p>AND THEY WHICH HEARD IT, BEING CONVICTED BY THEIR OWN
CONSCIENCE...</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus leaves them alone. That is the beauty of the man. He does not
even interfere by his presence; he is simply no more there. Their own
consciences starts pricking. They know. Maybe many times they have
lusted after THIS woman, and maybe they themselves have been
participants with this woman in the past. Maybe this woman is a
prostitute, and all these respectable people in their turn have made
love to her. Because one prostitute means that almost the whole town
becomes involved.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, in the ancient days, prostitutes were called NAGARVADHU,
the wife of the town. That is the right name.</p><p><br></p><p>So all of these people must have been involved in some way or other
with this woman or with other women – if not in acts, then in
thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>My feeling is it must be evening and the sun is setting, it is
becoming dark and Jesus is writing on the sand, stooping down, and it
becomes dark. And by and by people start disappearing in the dark.</p><p><br></p><p>AND THEY WHICH HEARD IT, BEING CONVICTED BY THEIR OWN CONSCIENCE,
WENT OUT ONE BY ONE, BEGINNING AT THE ELDEST – THE MAYOR – EVEN UNTO THE
LAST...</p><p><br></p><p>First the eldest disappeared, because of course, they have lived
long, so they have sinned long. The young people may not be such great
sinners; they have had not enough time yet. But the oldest disappeared
first. Those who were standing in front, they must have moved slowly to
the back, and then from the back they escaped. Because this man has
really created a great problem: he has changed the whole situation. They
had come to trap him and they are trapped.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot trap a Jesus or a Buddha; it is impossible – you will be
trapped. You exist at a lower state of mind. How can you trap a higher
state of mind? That is just foolish. The higher state can trap you
immediately, because from the higher state your whole being is
available.</p><p><br></p><p>Now Jesus must have looked into these people’s consciences – that was
possible for him – he must have seen all kinds of sins raising their
heads. In fact, even standing there, they were thinking about the woman:
how to get hold of her. Maybe they were angry because somebody else had
committed the sin and they were not given the opportunity. Maybe they
were only jealous: maybe they wanted to be there instead of that man who
had not been brought. ]esus must have looked from his height into their
hearts. He has trapped them. They forget their trap completely, they
forget about Moses</p><p>and the law etcetera. In fact, they were never worried about Moses
and the law. This has also to be understood.</p><p><br></p><p>They were really more interested in stoning this woman, enjoying this
murder. Not that they were interested in punishing somebody who had
committed a sin; that was just an excuse. They could not leave this
opportunity of murdering this woman. And now Moses can be used.</p><p><br></p><p>There are a thousand and one things said by Moses. They are not
worried about them. They are not interested in all those sayings and all
those statements. They are interested in this: that Moses says you can
stone a woman if you catch hold of her in adultery. They can’t miss this
great opportunity of murder, of violence. And when violence can be
committed according to the law, who would like to miss it? Not only will
they enjoy the violence, they will enjoy that they are very very legal
people, virtuous followers of Moses. But they have all forgotten about
it. Just a little turning by Jesus, and they have forgotten about
Moses... He has changed the whole point. He has changed their minds from
the woman to themselves. He has converted them, he has turned them
backwards – a one hundred and eighty degree turn. They were thinking
about the woman and Moses and Jesus, and he has changed their whole
attitude. He has made them their own target. He has turned their
consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Now he says ‘Look into yourself. If you have never committed a sin,
then... then you are allowed, then you can kill this woman.’</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN JESUS HAD LIFTED UP HIMSELF...</p><p><br></p><p>he saw they had all gone</p><p><br></p><p>... EVEN UNTO THE LAST: AND JESUS WAS LEFT ALONE, AND THE WOMAN
STANDING IN THE MIDST.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN JESUS HAD LIFTED UP HIMSELF, AND SAW NONE BUT THE WOMAN, HE SAID
UNTO HER, WOMAN, WHERE ARE THOSE THINE ACCUSERS?</p><p><br></p><p>Now he is not saying ‘I am accusing you.’</p><p><br></p><p>... WHERE ARE THOSE THINE ACCUSERS?</p><p><br></p><p>He is not for a single moment a participant in it. He has not judged,
he has not condemned. He has not said a single thing to the woman. He
simply says.</p><p><br></p><p>WOMAN WHERE ARE THOSE THINE ACCUSERS? HATH NO MAN CONDEMNED THEE?</p><p><br></p><p>Have they all gone? Has no man thrown a stone at you? SHE SAID, NO
MAN, LORD.</p><p>She must have felt deep respect, reverence for this man, who has not
only saved her physically, but who has not even accused her in any way.
Spiritually also he has saved her. She must have looked into those eyes
which have only love and compassion and nothing else.</p><p>This is the religious man. The moralist is always condemning,
accusing; the religious man, always accepting, forgiving.</p><p><br></p><p>SHE SAID, NO MAN, LORD. AND JESUS SAID UNTO HER, NEITHER DO I CONDEMN
THEE: GO, AND SIN NO MORE.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says ‘Nothing to be worried about – the past. The past is past,
gone is gone. Forget about it. But take some lesson from this situation.
Don’t go on making the same mistakes in the future – if you think they
are mistakes. I am not accusing you.’</p><p><br></p><p>NEITHER DO I CONDEMN THEE...</p><p><br></p><p>‘But if you feel that you have done something wrong, then it is up to
you. Don’t do it again. Forget the past, and don’t go on repeating
it.’</p><p><br></p><p>That is the whole message of all the Buddhas and all the Christs and
all the Krishnas: Forget the past, and if you understand, then don’t do
it again. That’s enough. There is no punishment, there is no judgement.
If you have been doing something, you were helpless. You are
unconscious, you have your limitations. You have your desires,
unfulfilled desires. Whatsoever you have been doing was the only thing
you could have done. So what is the point of accusing and condemning
you? The only thing that can be done is: your consciousness can be
raised high.</p><p><br></p><p>And that woman must have moved into a high consciousness. She must
have been afraid that she was going to be killed. Then this man, by a
single statement, saved her from death. Not only that, those accusers
disappeared. This man did a miracle! Not only that they didn’t kill her,
they simply became ashamed and escaped like thieves into the darkness of
the night. This man is a magician.</p><p><br></p><p>And now, he is saying ‘I don’t condemn you. If you feel you have been
doing something wrong, don’t do it again. That’s enough.’ He has
converted the woman.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what acid people call a ‘contact high’. Jesus is high, If you
come into close affinity with him, you will start moving high. This is
synchronicity – non-causal. The woman must have come there almost
condemning herself, ashamed of herself, thinking to commit suicide. He
has raised that woman, transformed that woman.</p><p><br></p><p>SHE SAID, NO MAN, LORD.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus becomes LORD, Jesus becomes God to her. She has never seen such
a godly man before. With no condemnation a man becomes a God. With no
judgement a man becomes a God. And just his presence, a single
statement, and those people disappeared and she is saved. And not only
saved physically, but spiritually intact. Jesus has not interfered at
all. He has not condemned, he has not said a single word. He simply says
‘Don’t repeat your past’ – not a single word more. ‘Let the past be past
and the gone, gone. You become new. All is good, and you are
forgiven.’</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus transformed many people by forgiving them. That was one of the
accusations against him – that he forgives people. Who is he to forgive?
Somebody has committed a sin – the society has to punish him! and if the
society cannot punish and the man escapes, then the society has prepared
a punishment through God – he should be thrown in hell.</p><p>Hindus also are very much against the idea that Jesus can forgive
you. The Christian idea is immense, tremendous, very great and
potential. Hindus say that you will have to suffer for your past KARMAS,
whatsoever you have done, you will have to undo. If you have done a bad
thing you will have to do a good thing. And the bad and its result are
going to come: you will have to suffer the consequence. Hindus will not
agree with this. Neither will agree the Buddhists, nor the Jains, nor
were Jews agreeing with Jesus. How can he forgive?</p><p><br></p><p>But I say to you: a man of that understanding can forgive. Not that
by his forgiving are you forgiven. But just if that consciousness, that
great consciousness can give you a feel of well-being – ‘Nothing is
wrong, don’t be worried; you can just shake off the past like dust and
get out of it’ – that very thing will give you such courage, such
enthusiasm, will open new possibilities and new doors. And you are freed
from it. You immediately move beyond it.</p><p><br></p><p>From this came the idea of Christian confession. It does not work
that way, because the man you go to confess to is an ordinary man just
like you. When you are confessing, the priest is not really forgiving
you, he may be condemning deep down. His forgiveness is just a show. He
is an ordinary man, he has no higher consciousness than you. Only from
the higher can forgiveness flow. Only from the high mountains can the
rivers flow towards the plains. Only from a Jesus or a Buddha, can
forgiveness flow. And when there is a man like Jesus or Buddha, just his
touch, just his look is enough to forgive you your whole past and all
your KARMAS.</p><p><br></p><p>I TOTALLY agree with Jesus. He brings a new vision to humanity: to
attain to freedom. The Hindu, the Jain, the Buddhist concept is very
ordinary and mathematical. It has no magic in it. It is very logical but
it has no love in it. Jesus brings love to the world.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

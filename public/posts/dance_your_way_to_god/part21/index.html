I don’t know which one is best to put more time and energy into.]\nThink more about love, about the heart. We call that chakra ‘anahata’ in yoga psychology.\nThere are seven chakras, and the anahata is just in the middle; three below it, three above it. The three below are muladhar, swadhisthan and manipur. Those three belong to an extrovert personality. In the west, the majority lives through those three chakras. And now in the east also, the majority is moving towards the western attitude of life. These three chakras are very easily available. They have a certain given function; you need not work much on them.\nWithout them, life will become impossible. They are survival measures, so nature has not given you a choice between them. From the moment you are born, those three chakras start functioning. They go on functioning until you die. The whole life is covered by those three chakras, and the extrovert person never comes to know that there is anything higher than these. Sex, money, power, prestige, respectability, name, fame – they all belong to those three chakras.\nAnd the centre of all those chakras is sex. People seek money in order to seek sex. People seek fame and power and prestige in order to seek sex. Sex remains the centre of the lower three chakras. Sex remains the centre of the extrovert personality. His whole mind revolves around sex.\nAbove the anahata, the heart, there are three chakras: visudha, the fourth centre, then ajna, between the two eyes, the third eye centre, and sahasrar, the last centre, the centre of samadhi, of ultimate unfoldment.\nBetween these two is the heart. Between the introvert and the extrovert, the heart functions as a door, it is a bridge. Just as sex is the centre of the extrovert mind, prayer – or call it meditation – is\nthe centre of the introvert mind. But to call it prayer is more relevant. Between these two – when a person is just in the middle, on the fourth chakra, at the door – love happens. Love is between sex and prayer.\nWhen sex is a little purified, it becomes love. When love is also purified, it becomes prayer. So it is the same energy, the sexual energy, which goes into higher formations. In the east people have tried to live an introvert life; they have tried to live above the heart. But both are lopsided. The western extrovert mind and the eastern introvert mind are both lopsided.\nTo become a total man, one needs the functioning of all seven. It is not a question of choice. It is a question of being capable of living in all the centres without any conflict. There is none – we create the conflict.\nA person can become an extrovert and can become an introvert very easily – just as you go out of your house and you come in. But whether you go out or you come in, you will have to pass from the door, and that door is anahata. So my emphasis is always on the anahata, the heart centre, because that is the door and both the dimensions meet there.\nIf somebody tries to live just below the heart centre, he closes the door. Then he becomes very worldly. He cannot even think that god exists. He cannot even think that religion can mean anything. It is all nonsense, rubbish. He does not even believe in love. He thinks love is just a bait for sex, just a foreplay for sex. Just not to be rude one has to at least pretend love. But the basic thing remains sex. He does not believe in love, he cannot believe in love, because he does not know what love is. He has never functioned at that centre. He has never stood on the door between the two worlds.\nThe introvert person also becomes very lopsided. He also closes the door of the heart because he becomes afraid. From that door opens the world. So he goes on denying. He becomes a renunciate, a monk, anti-life, condemnatory, repressive, afraid – continuously afraid of relationship, of moving with people, of creating any sort of love, because who knows? – love may bring in sex. Once you open the door of love, then the whole three chakras become available – the chakras of the below.\nIt is better not to open the doors so you can forget all about the lower world. Then one remains just inside – but one’s life becomes a morbidity. One becomes like an island – cut off from everything .\n. . a dry bone. No juice remains. The very shape of life disappears, because if you don’t love, life starts disappearing.\nLife exists when you love. Love becomes the very foundation for life to exist. It can have its foothold there.\nThe introvert becomes more and more sad – silent of course, but not happy. The extrovert is very excited; the introvert is never excited. He remains calm and quiet, but calmness and quietitude are not the goals of life. Ecstasy is the goal of life. Just to be calm and quiet can mean death, can mean suicide. You can dry up all the sources of life in you. You will become calm and quiet, all the fever gone, all the passion gone, all the lust gone – but then you are also gone. You are just an empty room, a negativity, a sort of absence, not a presence. You are not fulfilled. You cannot dance – you have nothing to dance about. You cannot sing. No song arises in your life because all songs dry up when love dries up.\nThe extrovert seems sometimes to be very happy . . . is more happy than the introvert, but never silent. More joyful – it is a joy to be with an extrovert. You cannot live with an introvert long; that’s why saints are so boring. It is good to pay respect to them, but you cannot live with them for twenty- four hours; they are really boring. And just to think about heaven where all the saints have gathered down the centuriesOne cannot believe how boring that place must now have become. It will be\nsheer boredom.\nYou can be with an extrovert, happily; you can relate with him. He is an excited being. He sings, he plays around... many games. He enjoys. Of course he is tense. He is never silent; that is his problem. Happiness is at a cost – that he loses tranquillity, equilibrium, balance. His excitement becomes more and more feverish, and there is every possibility of it turning into a delirium. The extrovert can be mad at any time; the breakdown can come very easily to him. He is so excited and so tense. He has no centre – just the revolving periphery.\nTo me, a real man or a real woman has to live in all the seven chakras together. Then you have the tranquillity of the introvert and the excitement of the extrovert. That’s what a rich life has to be – the silence of the introvert and the joy of the extrovert, the centre of the introvert and the periphery of the extrovert.\nA centre without a periphery is poor. A periphery without a centre is poor. When the periphery and the centre both exist together and you don’t choose – you simply move from one to another enjoying both, not putting them as opposites to each other but balancing them as complementaries – your life becomes tremendously rich.\nThat’s what I call life abundant. Then you really live in luxury, because you have all that the extrovert can have and all that the introvert can have; you have both the worlds together. Yes, in this sense, you can have the cake and eat it too. Then you are very affirmative. You don’t have any negations, any condemnations. Between samadhi and sex, between the muladhar, the first centre, and the sahasrar, the seventh, the whole sky is available to you, and whatsoever you choose, you can be. And it is good to go on changing. Why get fixed to one centre? Why not remain flexible, flowing, streaming like a river? Why become a pond? Why get stagnant and stale? Be dynamic.\nThat’s why I insist on dynamic meditations. ‘Meditation’ and ‘dynamic’ are a contradiction in terms. That means I am trying to make a combination of the extrovert and the introvert. Meditation means passivity, meditation means just to be oneself. And dynamism means to do many things, to be active, to be flowing. Dynamic meditation is a contradiction in terms but it is only apparently so. It is possible to have both.\n[Osho said it was good to live at the heart centre, sometimes moving to the centres below and sometimes to those above. He said the terms ‘higher’ and ‘lower’ did not denote any moral evaluation but were simply physiological descriptions. He said one should be like a rainbow – all the colours – and not obsessed with just one.\nAs one moved into all the centres, one saw that there was no contradiction in them and that the seven chakras were seven worlds]\nSex opens a door into the world, the sexual world. The heart opens the door into the world of love. The throat centre opens the door into the world of expression, creativity. The ajna, the third eye\ncentre, opens the world into clarity, vision, and makes one a master of one’s life. That’s why we call it ajna. Ajna means order.\nThen you are within your own order. You have your own discipline, and whatsoever you say, goes. Now there is no more conflict in you. It is not that you want something and you have to do something else. It is not that you never wanted to be angry and still you have become angry – no. When a person lives at the ajna centre, if he wants to be angry, he can be; no problem. If he wants to be angry, he can be even without any situation. He can be abruptly angry for no cause.\nGurdjieff used to play that game. He would be happy and talking and you could not even imagine that he would become angry. Everybody would be shocked at what had happened because there was not even a slight cause. Sometimes he would do the opposite. He would be angry, shouting, and then suddenly he would cool down so suddenly and so abruptly and the change would be so dramatic – as if he had never been angry.\nWhen you are at the sixth centre, ajna, everything goes as you want it to; there is no conflict. All these centres have to be used. No centre has to be sacrificed for another, because every centre is autonomous, has its own world. It does not exist for another, no. It is not a means for another. It exists for itself. It has intrinsic value.\n[She asks: How can I go to school in physics and work on my heart?]\nYou can – there’s no problem, not at all. You can be a scientist; there’s no problem in it. It becomes destructive only when you are only a scientist and you don’t have any dimension of meditation in you. Then it is destructive. Otherwise it can be very creative because it gives power.\nKnowledge is power, but that power becomes creative in the hands of those who are at ease with themselves, who are no more neurotic, but calm and quiet and blissful – then it becomes creative. If you are neurotic, then any power that falls into your hands is going to be destructive. A mad person is good when he is powerless.\nIt is said about tamerlane – one of the most destructive persons in history – that he asked a sufi sage, ‘I am very worried because I enjoy sleep too much. Twelve hours even are not enough – and I go on sleeping longer. People say it is bad; one should be active. What do you say?’ he asked the sufi sage.\nThe sufi sage said, ‘If you sleep twenty-four hours, that would be the best.’ Tamerlane was very angry. He said, ‘What do you mean – twenty-four hours!’ The sufi sage said, ‘Yes, the best thing would have been if you were never born. The next best thing is that you sleep twenty-four hours – and die as soon as possible, because people like you when they are awake, do mischief. At least while asleep you will not do any mischief.’\nSo it depends. . . it depends on you. It does not depend on science. Physics can be tremendously beneficial to the world, but the physicist has to be a totally different type of man. Ordinarily people who are ready to be angry for any small thing – for any trivia; ordi-nary people who are ready to die or kill for any small thing – should not have power. They should not become politicians, but they do. In fact, only they become politicians, because only they seek power. Who bothers? If you are really\nhappy, who bothers about power? Who competes for power? They hold much power – and they are ordinary people with very unconscious minds. Then wars become natural.\nIf you want to be a physicist, become a physicist, but go on growing in your inner being. Then nothing is harmful and everything can be used for something good. Become good, and whatsoever you do will be good. It is not a question of doing good – it is a question of being good.\nBut be here for a few weeks. Meditate, and then we will see. If you Still have the idea to continue, good. If the idea has disappeared, then there is no need to bother about it. Just be open. Whatsoever happens – and if you feel good about it – do it.\nDeva means divine and kanan means a wild forest; a divine, wild forest. And that’s what you have to keep in your heart – that to be wild is to be alive. The more civilised a person is, the less alive. I’m not saying to become uncivilised. I’m not saying to break the rules and regulations of the society, but remember deep inside that all the rules and regulations, and the civilisation and the society, are a game. Never lose contact with your inner wilderness. When you close your eyes, just become wild. When you are alone in your room, just become wild. Sing and dance and do things without any consideration of others.\nA person who is continuously considering others, never grows. When you are moving with people in the world, consider them, but remember that these rules are not commandments. They have nothing to do with truth. They are just conveniences. Of course one has to take care on the road to keep to the left or keep to the right; it has to be so. But keeping to the left has no truth about it, no fundamental . . . no ultimacy about it. It is just a rule of the game. If you want to walk on the road, you have to follow the rule. But when you are in your room alone, meditating, then there is no need to continuously keep to the left. Then you can just run in the middle of the road. You can forget all that society imposes, forces. That’s what is going to help your growth.\nAnd whenever you can find time, move into the forest. Go to the wild sea. Just watching will be beautiful. Swimming will be beautiful. . . surfing will be beautiful. . . going to the mountains will be beautiful. Keep more in touch with the non-human, and you will become capable of reaching to the superhuman. Don’t be confined to the human.\nOn both sides of the human, two worlds open. On one side is the world of the non-human – the trees, the birds, the rivers, the mountains, the stars; on another side, the superhuman – the world of god. It is difficult to know right now about the world of god, but one way is that you can drop out of the human world. You can become part of the non-human existence. And that will give you the clue about how to go above the human. If you can go below, you can go above. The same key opens and functions both ways.\nOnce you know that human boundaries can be crossed, then you know where those boundaries are and how to cross them. One becomes by and by, efficient, more and more skilful.\n[A seeker asks: I’m trying to learn to surrender – that’s the problem.]\nThen surrender! There is nothing else to do about it. It is a simple thing. It takes no efforts, no preparation. Just a decision is enough.\nSurrender is not something you have to arrange for, manage. It is nothing that you have to be prepared for. If you try to prepare, you will never be able to surrender. It is simply an understanding – that on your own you have not been able to achieve anything, on your own you have been struggling in vain. So why not drop that and try something totally new?\nSurrender needs only surrender, nothing else. It is a simple gesture; it is not very complex. [Osho gives him sannyas.]\nPrem means love and vinod means enjoyment. Become more loving and become more enjoying too. And there is nothing to enjoy like love. Don’t miss any opportunity to love, because all opportunities of love lost are opportunities of growth lost. I’m not saying that love is always easy. It is difficult. It has ups and downs. It has its dark nights too, but they are worth it. And out of the darkest night comes the beautiful morning.\nSo never be afraid of the dark night, otherwise you will miss the morning.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3075","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dance_your_way_to_god/part21/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dance_your_way_to_god/>Dance Your Way to God</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">21</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3075 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dance_Your_Way_to_God/part21.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part20>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

door of the heart because he becomes afraid. From that door opens the
world. So he goes on denying. He becomes a renunciate, a monk,
anti-life, condemnatory, repressive, afraid – continuously afraid of
relationship, of moving with people, of creating any sort of love,
because who knows? – love may bring in sex. Once you open the door of
love, then the whole three chakras become available – the chakras of the
below.</p><p><br></p><p>It is better not to open the doors so you can forget all about the
lower world. Then one remains just inside – but one’s life becomes a
morbidity. One becomes like an island – cut off from everything .</p><p>. . a dry bone. No juice remains. The very shape of life disappears,
because if you don’t love, life starts disappearing.</p><p><br></p><p>Life exists when you love. Love becomes the very foundation for life
to exist. It can have its foothold there.</p><p><br></p><p>The introvert becomes more and more sad – silent of course, but not
happy. The extrovert is very excited; the introvert is never excited. He
remains calm and quiet, but calmness and quietitude are not the goals of
life. Ecstasy is the goal of life. Just to be calm and quiet can mean
death, can mean suicide. You can dry up all the sources of life in you.
You will become calm and quiet, all the fever gone, all the passion
gone, all the lust gone – but then you are also gone. You are just an
empty room, a negativity, a sort of absence, not a presence. You are not
fulfilled. You cannot dance – you have nothing to dance about. You
cannot sing. No song arises in your life because all songs dry up when
love dries up.</p><p>The extrovert seems sometimes to be very happy . . . is more happy
than the introvert, but never silent. More joyful – it is a joy to be
with an extrovert. You cannot live with an introvert long; that’s why
saints are so boring. It is good to pay respect to them, but you cannot
live with them for twenty- four hours; they are really boring. And just
to think about heaven where all the saints have gathered down the
centuries<span class=s4></span>One cannot believe how boring that
place must now have become. It will be</p><p>sheer boredom.</p><p><br></p><p>You can be with an extrovert, happily; you can relate with him. He is
an excited being. He sings, he plays around... many games. He enjoys. Of
course he is tense. He is never silent; that is his problem. Happiness
is at a cost – that he loses tranquillity, equilibrium, balance. His
excitement becomes more and more feverish, and there is every
possibility of it turning into a delirium. The extrovert can be mad at
any time; the breakdown can come very easily to him. He is so excited
and so tense. He has no centre – just the revolving periphery.</p><p><br></p><p>To me, a real man or a real woman has to live in all the seven
chakras together. Then you have the tranquillity of the introvert and
the excitement of the extrovert. That’s what a rich life has to be – the
silence of the introvert and the joy of the extrovert, the centre of the
introvert and the periphery of the extrovert.</p><p><br></p><p>A centre without a periphery is poor. A periphery without a centre is
poor. When the periphery and the centre both exist together and you
don’t choose – you simply move from one to another enjoying both, not
putting them as opposites to each other but balancing them as
complementaries – your life becomes tremendously rich.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what I call life abundant. Then you really live in luxury,
because you have all that the extrovert can have and all that the
introvert can have; you have both the worlds together. Yes, in this
sense, you can have the cake and eat it too. Then you are very
affirmative. You don’t have any negations, any condemnations. Between
samadhi and sex, between the muladhar, the first centre, and the
sahasrar, the seventh, the whole sky is available to you, and whatsoever
you choose, you can be. And it is good to go on changing. Why get fixed
to one centre? Why not remain flexible, flowing, streaming like a river?
Why become a pond? Why get stagnant and stale? Be dynamic.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I insist on dynamic meditations. ‘Meditation’ and
‘dynamic’ are a contradiction in terms. That means I am trying to make a
combination of the extrovert and the introvert. Meditation means
passivity, meditation means just to be oneself. And dynamism means to do
many things, to be active, to be flowing. Dynamic meditation is a
contradiction in terms but it is only apparently so. It is possible to
have both.</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho said it was good to live at the heart centre, sometimes moving
to the centres below and sometimes to those above. He said the terms
‘higher’ and ‘lower’ did not denote any moral evaluation but were simply
physiological descriptions. He said one should be like a rainbow – all
the colours – and not obsessed with just one.</p><p><br></p><p>As one moved into all the centres, one saw that there was no
contradiction in them and that the seven chakras were seven worlds<span class=s4></span>]</p><p><br></p><p>Sex opens a door into the world, the sexual world. The heart opens
the door into the world of love. The throat centre opens the door into
the world of expression, creativity. The ajna, the third eye</p><p>centre, opens the world into clarity, vision, and makes one a master
of one’s life. That’s why we call it ajna. Ajna means order.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you are within your own order. You have your own discipline, and
whatsoever you say, goes. Now there is no more conflict in you. It is
not that you want something and you have to do something else. It is not
that you never wanted to be angry and still you have become angry – no.
When a person lives at the ajna centre, if he wants to be angry, he can
be; no problem. If he wants to be angry, he can be even without any
situation. He can be abruptly angry for no cause.</p><p><br></p><p>Gurdjieff used to play that game. He would be happy and talking and
you could not even imagine that he would become angry. Everybody would
be shocked at what had happened because there was not even a slight
cause. Sometimes he would do the opposite. He would be angry, shouting,
and then suddenly he would cool down so suddenly and so abruptly and the
change would be so dramatic – as if he had never been angry.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are at the sixth centre, ajna, everything goes as you want
it to; there is no conflict. All these centres have to be used. No
centre has to be sacrificed for another, because every centre is
autonomous, has its own world. It does not exist for another, no. It is
not a means for another. It exists for itself. It has intrinsic
value.</p><p><br></p><p>[She asks: How can I go to school in physics and work on my
heart?]</p><p><br></p><p>You can – there’s no problem, not at all. You can be a scientist;
there’s no problem in it. It becomes destructive only when you are only
a scientist and you don’t have any dimension of meditation in you. Then
it is destructive. Otherwise it can be very creative because it gives
power.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowledge is power, but that power becomes creative in the hands of
those who are at ease with themselves, who are no more neurotic, but
calm and quiet and blissful – then it becomes creative. If you are
neurotic, then any power that falls into your hands is going to be
destructive. A mad person is good when he is powerless.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said about tamerlane – one of the most destructive persons in
history – that he asked a sufi sage, ‘I am very worried because I enjoy
sleep too much. Twelve hours even are not enough – and I go on sleeping
longer. People say it is bad; one should be active. What do you say?’ he
asked the sufi sage.</p><p><br></p><p>The sufi sage said, ‘If you sleep twenty-four hours, that would be
the best.’ Tamerlane was very angry. He said, ‘What do you mean –
twenty-four hours!’ The sufi sage said, ‘Yes, the best thing would have
been if you were never born. The next best thing is that you sleep
twenty-four hours – and die as soon as possible, because people like you
when they are awake, do mischief. At least while asleep you will not do
any mischief.’</p><p><br></p><p>So it depends. . . it depends on you. It does not depend on science.
Physics can be tremendously beneficial to the world, but the physicist
has to be a totally different type of man. Ordinarily people who are
ready to be angry for any small thing – for any trivia; ordi-nary people
who are ready to die or kill for any small thing – should not have
power. They should not become politicians, but they do. In fact, only
they become politicians, because only they seek power. Who bothers? If
you are really</p><p>happy, who bothers about power? Who competes for power? They hold
much power – and they are ordinary people with very unconscious minds.
Then wars become natural.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to be a physicist, become a physicist, but go on growing
in your inner being. Then nothing is harmful and everything can be used
for something good. Become good, and whatsoever you do will be good. It
is not a question of doing good – it is a question of being good.</p><p><br></p><p>But be here for a few weeks. Meditate, and then we will see. If you
Still have the idea to continue, good. If the idea has disappeared, then
there is no need to bother about it. Just be open. Whatsoever happens –
and if you feel good about it – do it.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine and kanan means a wild forest; a divine, wild
forest. And that’s what you have to keep in your heart – that to be wild
is to be alive. The more civilised a person is, the less alive. I’m not
saying to become uncivilised. I’m not saying to break the rules and
regulations of the society, but remember deep inside that all the rules
and regulations, and the civilisation and the society, are a game. Never
lose contact with your inner wilderness. When you close your eyes, just
become wild. When you are alone in your room, just become wild. Sing and
dance and do things without any consideration of others.</p><p><br></p><p>A person who is continuously considering others, never grows. When
you are moving with people in the world, consider them, but remember
that these rules are not commandments. They have nothing to do with
truth. They are just conveniences. Of course one has to take care on the
road to keep to the left or keep to the right; it has to be so. But
keeping to the left has no truth about it, no fundamental . . . no
ultimacy about it. It is just a rule of the game. If you want to walk on
the road, you have to follow the rule. But when you are in your room
alone, meditating, then there is no need to continuously keep to the
left. Then you can just run in the middle of the road. You can forget
all that society imposes, forces. That’s what is going to help your
growth.</p><p><br></p><p>And whenever you can find time, move into the forest. Go to the wild
sea. Just watching will be beautiful. Swimming will be beautiful. . .
surfing will be beautiful. . . going to the mountains will be beautiful.
Keep more in touch with the non-human, and you will become capable of
reaching to the superhuman. Don’t be confined to the human.</p><p><br></p><p>On both sides of the human, two worlds open. On one side is the world
of the non-human – the trees, the birds, the rivers, the mountains, the
stars; on another side, the superhuman – the world of god. It is
difficult to know right now about the world of god, but one way is that
you can drop out of the human world. You can become part of the
non-human existence. And that will give you the clue about how to go
above the human. If you can go below, you can go above. The same key
opens and functions both ways.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you know that human boundaries can be crossed, then you know
where those boundaries are and how to cross them. One becomes by and by,
efficient, more and more skilful.</p><p><br></p><p>[A seeker asks: I’m trying to learn to surrender – that’s the
problem.]</p><p><br></p><p>Then surrender! There is nothing else to do about it. It is a simple
thing. It takes no efforts, no preparation. Just a decision is
enough.</p><p>Surrender is not something you have to arrange for, manage. It is
nothing that you have to be prepared for. If you try to prepare, you
will never be able to surrender. It is simply an understanding – that on
your own you have not been able to achieve anything, on your own you
have been struggling in vain. So why not drop that and try something
totally new?</p><p><br></p><p>Surrender needs only surrender, nothing else. It is a simple gesture;
it is not very complex. [Osho gives him sannyas.]</p><p>Prem means love and vinod means enjoyment. Become more loving and
become more enjoying too. And there is nothing to enjoy like love. Don’t
miss any opportunity to love, because all opportunities of love lost are
opportunities of growth lost. I’m not saying that love is always easy.
It is difficult. It has ups and downs. It has its dark nights too, but
they are worth it. And out of the darkest night comes the beautiful
morning.</p><p><br></p><p>So never be afraid of the dark night, otherwise you will miss the
morning.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part20>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

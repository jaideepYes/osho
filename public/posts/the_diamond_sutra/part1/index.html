THEN MANY MONKS APPROACHED TO WHERE\nTHE LORD WAS, SALUTED HIS FEET WITH THEIR HEADS, THRICE WALKED ROUND HIM TO THE RIGHT, AND SAT DOWN ON ONE SIDE. AT THAT TIME THE VENERABLE SUBHUTI CAME TO THAT ASSEMBLY, AND SAT DOWN. THEN HE ROSE FROM HIS SEAT,\nPUT HIS UPPER ROBE OVER ONE SHOULDER, PLACED HIS RIGHT KNEE ON THE GROUND,\nBENT FORTH HIS FOLDED HANDS TOWARDS THE LORD, AND SAID TO THE LORD:\n'IT IS WONDERFUL, O LORD,\nIT IS EXCEEDINGLY WONDERFUL, O WELL-GONE, HOW MUCH THE BODHISATTVAS,\nTHE GREAT BEINGS, HAVE BEEN HELPED\nWITH THE GREATEST HELP BY THE TATHAGATA. HOW THEN, O LORD, SHOULD ONE WHO HAS SET OUT IN THE BODHISATTVA-VEHICLE, STAND, HOW PROGRESS,\nHOW CONTROL THE THOUGHTS?'\nAFTER THESE WORDS THE LORD SAID TO SUBHUTI: 'THEREFORE, SUBHUTI, LISTEN WELL,\nAND ATTENTIVELY!'\nSOMEONE WHO HAS SET OUT IN THE VEHICLE OF A BODHISATTVA SHOULD PRODUCE\nA THOUGHT IN THIS MANNER:\n'AS MANY BEINGS AS THERE ARE IN THE UNIVERSE OF BEINGS,\nCOMPREHENDED UNDER THE TERM \"BEINGS\", ALL THESE I MUST LEAD TO NIRVANA,\nINTO THAT REALM OF NIRVANA WHICH LEAVES NOTHING BEHIND.\nAND YET, ALTHOUGH INNUMERABLE BEINGS HAVE THUS BEEN LED TO NIRVANA,\nNO BEING AT ALL HAS BEEN LED TO NIRVANA.' AND WHY?\nIF IN A BODHISATTVA THE NOTION OF A \"BEING\" SHOULD TAKE PLACE,\nHE COULD NOT BE CALLED A BODHI-BEING. AND WHY?\nHE IS NOT TO BE CALLED A BODHI-BEING IN WHOM THE NOTION OF A SELF\nOR OF A BEING SHOULD TAKE PLACE, OR THE NOTION OF A LIVING SOUL OR OF A PERSON.'\nI love Gautama the Buddha because he represents to me the essential core of religion. He is not the founder of Buddhism -- Buddhism is a byproduct -- but he is the beginner of a totally different kind of religion in the world. He's the founder of a religionless religion.\nHe has propounded not religion but religiousness. And this is a great radical change in the history of human consciousness.\nBefore Buddha there were religions but never a pure religiousness. Man was not yet mature. With Buddha, humanity enters into a mature age. All human beings have not yet entered into that, that's true, but Buddha has heralded the path;\nBuddha has opened the gateless gate. It takes time for human beings to understand such a deep message.\nBuddha's message is the deepest ever. Nobody has done the work that Buddha has done, the way he has done. Nobody else represents pure fragrance.\nOther founders of religions, other enlightened people, have compromised with their audience. Buddha remains uncompromised, hence his purity. He does not care what you can understand, he cares only what the truth is. And he says it without being worried whether you understand it or not. In a way this looks hard; in another way this is great compassion.\nTruth has to be said as it is. The moment you compromise, the moment you bring truth to the ordinary level of human consciousness, it loses its soul, it becomes superficial, it becomes a dead thing. You cannot bring truth to the level of human beings; human beings have to be led to the level of truth. That is Buddha's great work.\nTwenty-five centuries ago, just some day early in the morning -- just like this day -- this sutra was born. Twelve hundred and fifty monks were present. It happened in the city of Sravasti. It was a great city of those days. The word Sravasti means the city of glory. It was one of the glorious cities of ancient India; it had nine hundred thousand families in it.\nNow that city has completely disappeared. A very very small village exists -- you will not find even its name on any map; even the name has disappeared. Now it is called Sahet-Mahet. It is impossible to believe that such a great city existed there. This is the way of life -- things go on changing. Cities turn into cemeteries, cemeteries turn into cities... life is a flux.\nBuddha must have loved this city of Sravasti, because out of forty-five years of his ministry he stayed in Sravasti twenty-five years. He must have loved the people. The people must have been of a very evolved consciousness. All the great sutras of Buddha, almost all, were born in Sravasti.\nThis sutra -- The Diamond Sutra -- was also born in Sravasti. The Sanskrit name of this sutra is Vajrachchedika Prajnaparamita Sutra. It means perfection of wisdom which cuts like a thunderbolt. If you allow, Buddha can cut you like a thunderbolt. He can behead you. He can kill you and help you to be reborn.\nA buddha has to be both -- a murderer and a mother. On the one hand he has to kill, on the other hand he has to give new being to you. The new being is possible only when the old has been destroyed. Only on the ashes of the old the new is born. Man is a phoenix.\nThe mythological bird phoenix is not just a mythology, it is a metaphor. It stands for man. That phoenix exists nowhere except in man. Man is the being who has to die to be reborn.\nThat's what Jesus said to Nicodemus. Nicodemus was a professor, a learned man, a rabbi, a member of the board that controlled the great temple of Jerusalem. One dark night he came to see Jesus. He could not gather courage to come to him in the day time; he was afraid what people would say. He was so respectable, so much respected. Going to a vagabond teacher?... going to somebody who is hated by all the rabbis and all the learned people?... going to somebody who moves with thieves and drunkards and prostitutes? But something in him was very desirous to see this man. maybe he had seen Jesus walking, coming to the temple. He must have felt something deep in his unconscious for this man.\nHe could not hold himself back.\nOne night when everybody had left, when even the disciples had gone to sleep, he reached Jesus and he asked, \"What should I do so that I can also enter into the kingdom of God?\"\nAnd Jesus said, \"Unless you die nothing is possible. If you die, only then can you enter into the kingdom of God. You will have to die as you are, only then can you be born as really your inner being is.\"\nThe ego has to die for the essential being to surface. That is the meaning of Vajrachchedika Prajnaparamita. It cuts like a thunderbolt. In one stroke it can destroy you. It is one of the greatest sermons of Buddha. Get in tune with it.\nBefore we enter into the sutra, a few things to be understood that will help you to understand it. Gautama the Buddha has started a spirituality that is nonrepressive and nonideological. That is a very rare phenomenon. The ordinary kind of spirituality, the garden variety, is very repressive. It depends on repression. It does not transform man, it only cripples man. It does not liberate man, it enslaves man. It is oppressive, it is ugly.\nListen to these words of Thomas a Kempis, author of Imitation of Christ. He writes: \"The more violence you do to yourself, the greater will be your growth in grace. There is no other way save of daily mortification. To despise oneself is the best and the most perfect counsel.\" There are thousands of saints down the ages who will agree with Thomas a Kempis. And Thomas a Kempis is pathological.\nOr the French priest Bossuet says: \"Cursed be the earth! Cursed be the earth! A thousand times cursed be the earth.\" Why? Why should the earth be cursed? Life has to be cursed.\nThese people have been thinking as if God is against life, as if life is against God. Life IS\nGod, there is no antagonism, there is no separation even. They are not different things, they are two names for one reality.\nRemember this: Buddha is nonrepressive. And if you find Buddhist monks to be repressive, remember, they have not understood Buddha at all. They have brought their own pathology into his teachings. And Buddha is non-ideological. He gives no ideology, because all ideologies are of the mind. And if ideologies are of the mind, they cannot take you beyond the mind. No ideology can become a bridge to reach beyond the mind. All ideologies have to be dropped, only then the mind will be dropped.\nBuddha believes in no ideals either -- because all ideals create tension and conflict in man. They divide, they create anguish. You are one thing and they want you to be something else. Between these two you are stretched, torn apart. Ideals create misery.\nIdeals create schizophrenia. The more ideals there are, the more people will be schizophrenic, they will be split. Only a nonideological consciousness can avoid being split. And if you are split how can you be happy? how can you be silent? how can you know anything of peace, of stillness?\nThe ideological person is continuously fighting with himself. Each moment there is conflict. He lives in conflict, he lives in confusion, because he cannot decide who really he is -- the ideal or the reality. He cannot trust himself, he becomes afraid of himself, he loses confidence. And once a man loses confidence he loses all glory. Then he is ready to become a slave to anybody -- to any priest, to any politician. Then he is just ready, waiting to fall in some trap.\nWhy do people become followers? Why are people trapped? Why do people fall for a Joseph Stalin or an Adolf Hitler or a Mao Zedong? Why in the first place? They have become so shaky, the ideological confusion has shaken them from their very roots. Now they cannot stand on their own, they want somebody to lean on. They cannot move on their own, they don't know who they are. They need somebody to tell them that they are this or that. They need an identity to be given to them. They have forgotten their self and their nature.\nAdolf Hitlers and Joseph Stalins and Mao Zedongs will be coming again and again until and unless man drops all ideologies. And remember, when I say all ideologies, I mean ALL ideologies. I don't make any distinction between noble ideologies and not so noble.\nAll ideologies are dangerous. In fact the noble ideologies are more dangerous, because they have a more seductive power, they are more persuasive. But ideology as such is a disease, exactly a dis-ease, because you become two: the ideal and vou. And the you that you are is condemned,,, and the you that you are not is praised. Now you are getting into trouble. Now sooner or later you will be neurotic, psychotic or something.\nBuddha has given a nonrepressive way of life, and nonideological too. That's why he does not talk about God, he does not talk about heaven, he does not talk about any future.\nHe does not give you anything to hold onto, he takes everything away from you. He takes even your self. He goes on taking things away, and finally he takes even the idea of self, I, ego. He leaves only pure emptiness behind. And this is very difficult.\nThis is very difficult because we have completely forgotten how to give. We only know how to take. We go on taking everything. I TAKE the exam and I TAKE the wife and even I TAKE the afternoon nap -- a thing which cannot be taken, you have to surrender to it. Sleep comes only when you surrender. Even a wife, a husband, you go on taking. You are not respectful. The wife is not a property. You can take a house -- how can you take a wife or a husband? But our language shows our mind. We don't know how to give - how to give in, how to let go, how to let things happen.\nBuddha takes all ideals away, the whole future away, and finally he takes the last\nthing that is very very difficult for us to give -- he takes your very self, leaves a pure, innocent, virgin emptiness behind. That virgin emptiness he calls nirvana. Nirvana is not a goal, it is just your emptiness. When you have dropped all that you have accumulated, when you don't hoard anymore, when you are no longer a miser and a clinger, then suddenly that emptiness erupts. It has always been there.\nHakuin is right: \"From the very beginning, all beings are buddhas.\" That emptiness is there. You have accumulated junk so that emptiness is not visible. It is just like in your house you can go on accumulating things; then you stop seeing any space, then there is no more space. A day comes when even to move in the house becomes difficult; to live becomes difficult because there is no space. But space has not gone anywhere. Think of it, meditate over it. The space has not gone anywhere; you have accumulated too much furniture and the TV and the radio and the radiogram and the piano and everything -- but the space has not gone anywhere. Remove the furniture and the space is there; it has always been there. It was hidden by the furniture but it was not destroyed. It has not left the room, not for a single moment. So is your inner emptiness, your nirvana, your nothingness.\nBuddha does not give you nirvana as an ideal. Buddha liberates instead of coercing.\nBuddha teaches you how to live -- not for any goal, not to achieve anything, but to be blissful herenow -- how to live in awareness. Not that awareness is going to give you something -- awareness is not a means to anything; it is the end in itself, the means and the end both. Its value is intrinsic.\nBuddha does not teach you otherworldliness. This has to be understood. People are worldly; the priests go on teaching the other world. The other world is also not very otherworldly, it cannot be, because it is just an improved model of the same world. From where can you create the other world? You know only this world. You can improve, you can decorate the other world better, you can remove a few things that are ugly here and you can replace a few things which you think will be beautiful, but it is going to be a creation out of the experience of this world. So your other world is not very different, cannot be. It is a continuity. It comes out of your mind; it is a game of imagination.\nYou will have beautiful women there -- of course more beautiful than you have\nhere. You will have the same kinds of pleasures there -- maybe more permanent, stable, but they will be the same kinds of pleasures. You will have better food, more tasty -- but you will have food. You will have houses, maybe made of gold\n-- but they will be houses. You will repeat the whole thing again.\nJust go into the scriptures and see how they depict the heaven and you will find the same world improved upon. A few touches here and a few touches there, but it is not in any way otherworldly. That's why I say the otherworldliness of other religions is not very otherworldly; it is this world projected into the future. It is born out of the experience of this world. There will not be misery and poverty and illness and paralysis and blindness and deafness. Things that you don't like here will not be there, and things that you like will be there and in abundance, but it is not going to be anything new.\nMind cannot conceive of anything new. Mind is incapable of conceiving the new. Mind lives in the old, mind IS the old. The new never happens through the mind. The new happens only when mind is not functioning, when mind is not controlling you, when mind has been put aside. The new happens only when the mind is not interfering.\nBut all your scriptures talk about the heaven -- and the heaven or the paradise or FIRDAUS or SWARGA, is nothing but the same story. It may be printed on a better art paper, with better ink, in a more improved press, with more colorful illustrations, but the story is the same; it cannot be otherwise.\nBuddha does not talk of otherworldliness or the other world. He simply teaches you how to be here in this world; how to be here alert, conscious, mindful, so that nothing impinges upon your emptiness; so that your inner emptiness is not contaminated, poisoned; so that you can live here and yet remain uncontaminated, unpolluted; so that you can be in the world and the world will not be in you.\nThe otherworldly spirituality is bound to be oppressive, destructive, sado- masochistic --\nin short, pathological. Buddha's spirituality has a different flavor to it -- the flavor of no ideal, the flavor of no future, the flavor of no other world. It is a flower here and now. It asks for nothing. All is already given. It simply becomes more alert so you can see more, you can hear more, you can be more.\nRemember, you are only in the same proportion as you are conscious. If you want to be more, be more conscious. Consciousness imparts being. Unconsciousness takes being away. When you are drunk you lose being. When you are fast asleep you lose being.\nHave you not watched it? When you are alert you have a different quality -- you are centered, rooted. When you are alert you feel the solidity of your being, it is almost tangible. When you are unconscious, just dragging by, sleepy, your sense of being is less.\nIt is always in the same proportion as the consciousness is.\nSo Buddha's whole message is to be conscious. And for no other reason, just for the sake of being conscious -- because consciousness imparts being, consciousness creates you.\nAnd a you so different from you that you are, that you cannot imagine. A you where 'I'\nhas disappeared, where no idea of self exists, nothing defines you... a pure emptiness, an infinity, unbounded emptiness.\nThis Buddha calls the state of meditation -- SAMMASAMADHI, right state of meditation, when you are all alone. But remember, aloneness is not loneliness. Have you ever thought about this beautiful word, alone? It means all one. It is made of two words --\nall and one. In aloneness you become one with the all.\nAloneness has nothing of loneliness in it. You are not lonely when you are alone. You are alone but not lonely -- because you are one with the all; how can you be lonely? You don't miss others, true. Not that you have forgotten them, not that you don't need them, not that you don't care about them, no. You don't remember others because you are one with them. All the distinction between one and all is lost. One has become the all and all has become one. This English word alone is immensely beautiful.\nBuddha says sammasamadhi is aloneness. The right meditation is to be so utterly alone that you are one with all. Let me explain it to you. If you are empty your boundaries disappear because emptiness can have no boundaries. Emptiness can\nonly be infinite.\nEmptiness cannot have any weight, emptiness cannot have any color, emptiness cannot have any name, emptiness cannot have any form. When you are empty, how will you divide yourself from others? -- because you don't have any color, you don't have any name, you don't have any form, you don't have any boundaries. How are you going to make any distinctions? When you are empty you are one with all. You have melted into existence, existence has merged with you. You are no more an island, you have become the vast continent of being.\nBuddha's whole message is condensed in this one word -- sammasamadhi, right meditation. What is right meditation and what is wrong meditation? If the meditator exists then it is wrong meditation. If the meditator is lost in meditation then it is right meditation. Right meditation brings you to emptiness and aloneness.\nThis sutra... this whole sutra is concerned with how to become utterly empty. This is his basic gift to the world.\nTHUS HAVE I HEARD AT ONE TIME.\nThese sutras have been remembered by Buddha's great disciple Ananda. And one thing to be remembered: all sutras start: THUS HAVE I HEARD.…\nWhen Buddha died all the disciples gathered together to collect whatsoever Buddha had said in those forty-five years. Ananda was the only one who had lived continuously for those forty-five years with Buddha. He was the most authentic to be relied upon. Others had heard, but they had heard from others. Sometimes they were with Buddha and sometimes they were not with Buddha. Only Ananda had lived like a shadow.\nSo Ananda relates, but the beauty is that he never says that \"Buddha said this\"; he simply says, \"Thus have I heard\". The difference is great. He does not say, \"Buddha has said this,\" because he says, \"How am I to say what Buddha has said? All that I can say is this -\n- that this is what I have heard. What Buddha said, only he knows. What he meant, only he knows. All that I can remember is what I have heard. My capacities are limited. He may have meant something else. I may have forgotten a few words, I may have put a few words of my own.\"\nThis is a great sincerity. He could have claimed, \"This is what Buddha said. I was present, I am an eyewitness.\" And he WAS an eyewitness; nobody can deny that. But look at the humbleness of the man: he says \"Thus have I heard. Buddha was saying, I was hearing -- I can only relate what I have heard. It may be right, it may not be right. I may have interfered, I may have interpreted, I may have forgotten a few things, something of my own mind may have got into it -- that all is possible. I am not an enlightened man.\"\nAnanda was not yet enlightened, so he says, \"This is all that I can say, I can vouch for.\"\nTHUS HAVE I HEARD AT ONE TIME. THE LORD DWELT AT SRAVASTI.\nEARLY IN THE MORNING THE LORD DRESSED, PUT ON HIS CLOAK, TOOK HIS BOWL,\nAND ENTERED THE GREAT CITY OF SRAVASTI TO COLLECT ALMS.\nWHEN HE HAD EATEN AND RETURNED FROM HIS ROUND, THE LORD PUT AWAY HIS BOWL AND CLOAK, WASHED HIS FEET,\nAND SAT DOWN ON THE SEAT ARRANGED FOR HIM, CROSSING HIS LEGS,\nHOLDING HIS BODY UPRIGHT, AND MINDFULLY FIXING HIS ATTENTION IN FRONT OF HIM.\nThis you will be surprised at. When Ananda says, he goes into very small details. One never knows -- when you are reporting about a buddha, you have to be very careful, mm?\nEven this much he reports again and again -- such small things. EARLY IN THE MORNING THE LORD DRESSED,\nPUT ON HIS CLOAK, TOOK HIS BOWL,\nAND ENTERED THE GREAT CITY OF SRAVASTI TO COLLECT ALMS.\nAnanda is following him like a shadow, a silent shadow just watching him. Just to watch him was a benediction. And he watches everything.\nWHEN HE HAD EATEN AND RETURNED FROM HIS ROUND, THE LORD PUT AWAY HIS BOWL AND CLOAK, WASHED HIS FEET,\nAND SAT DOWN ON THE SEAT ARRANGED FOR HIM.\nWhen for the first time Buddhist sutras were translated into Western languages, the translators were a little bit puzzled -- why this continuous repetition? It goes on and on like that; again it will be, again this repetition. Why are these small things related? They could not understand it. They thought that this is repetitive, that this is a very unnecessary repetition; it is not needed at all. What is the point of it all? But they missed. What Ananda is saying is that Buddha pays attention to small things as much as to big things.\nFor a buddha there is nothing small and nothing big -- one thing.\nWhen he takes his bowl he is as respectful to the bowl as he would be respectful to any God. When he puts his cloak or puts his dress on he is so mindful; he's absolutely alert, he is not mechanical. When you put your dress on you are mechanical. You know mechanically how to put it on, so what is the point of paying attention to it? Your mind goes on moving into a thousand directions. And you take a shower -- but you are very disrespectful to the shower. You have not been there, you have been somewhere else.\nYou eat, but you are disrespectful to the food. You are not there, you simply go\non swallowing the food inside you. You go on doing your things habitually, mechanically.\nWhen Buddha does a thing he is utterly there, he is nowhere else. WHEN HE HAD EATEN AND RETURNED\nFROM HIS ROUND, THE LORD PUT AWAY HIS BOWL AND CLOAK, WASHED HIS FEET,\nAND SAT DOWN ON THE SEAT ARRANGED FOR HIM, CROSSING HIS LEGS,\nHOLDING HIS BODY UPRIGHT, AND MINDFULLY FIXING HIS ATTENTION IN FRONT OF HIM.…\nThese minor details are worth relating, because they bring the quality of buddhahood.\nEach moment he lives in awareness. What he is doing is irrelevant; each moment he pours his attention into whatsoever he is doing. When he makes a gesture he is totally the gesture. When he smiles he is totally the smile. When he talks he is totally his words.\nAnd when he is silent he is totally silent.\nTo watch a buddha is a blessing in itself -- how he walks, how he sits, how he makes gestures, how he looks at you. Each moment is a radiant moment of awareness. That's why Ananda reports. There must have been great silence when Buddha came, arranged his dress, washed his feet, sat on the seat arranged for him, sat upright, then focussed his whole attention in front of him. What is this 'fixing your attention in front of yourself'?\nThat is a special Buddhist method called ANAPANSATIYOGA -- mindfulness of breath coming in and breath going out. That is the meaning of focussing your attention in front.\nWhen Buddha is doing something, for example dressing, then he is attentive of that act.\nWhen he is walking he is attentive of walking. When he is not doing anything then he is attentive of breath coming in and breath going out. But he is attentive; even while he is asleep he is attentive.\nAnanda asked Buddha once.… For ten years he lived with Buddha and he was surprised that he remained in the same posture the whole night. Wherever he put his hand, he kept it there the whole night. He must have looked many times, must have sneaked in in the night. It was worth it, mm? -- how the Buddha sleeps? And he was surprised and puzzled that he kept the same posture -- the same posture the whole night. He could not hold his curiosity. One day he said, \"It is not right for me to get up in the night and look at you, I should not do such a thing, but I am curious about you and I am puzzled -- you remain in the same posture? Do you sleep or do you continue your awareness?\"\nAnd Buddha said, \"Sleep happens in the body, I remain alert. Now the sleep is coming, now it has come, now it has settled, now the body is relaxed, the limbs are relaxed -- but I keep my awareness bright.\"\nMeditation is a twenty-four hour thing. It is not that you do it once a day and you are finished with it. It has to become your flavor, it has to become your climate. It should surround you wherever you are, whatsoever you are doing.\n... AND MINDFULLY FIXING HIS ATTENTION IN FRONT OF HIM, HE SAT.\nTHEN MANY MONKS APPROACHED TO WHERE THE LORD WAS,\nSALUTED HIS FEET WITH THEIR HEADS, THRICE WALKED ROUND HIM TO THE RIGHT AND SAT DOWN ON ONE SIDE.\nTo ask a question to a Buddha needs a certain attitude, only then will you receive\nthe answer. Not that Buddha will not give the answer. You can ask very disrespectfully --\nBuddha will give the answer, but you will not receive it. So it is not a question that only when you are respectful will Buddha give the answer. Buddha will give the answer anyway, but if you are not very respectful, very humble, receptive, feminine, you will miss it. How you ask the question determines whether you will be able to receive the answer or not.\nHow you ask, in what mood Are you receptive? Are you just curious? Are you\nasking the question out of your accumulated knowledge or is your question innocent? Are you asking just to test whether this man knows or not? Are you asking from a state of knowledge or from a state of not knowing? Are you humble, surrendered? Are you ready to receive the gift if it is given to you? will you be open, will you welcome it? will you take it to your heart? Will you allow it to become a seed in your heart? To ask a question to a Buddha is not to ask a question to a professor. It needs a certain quality in you; then only will you be benefited by it.\nTHEN MANY MONKS APPROACHED TO WHERE THE LORD WAS,\nSALUTED HIS FEET WITH THEIR HEADS, THRICE WALKED ROUND HIM TO THE RIGHT AND SAT DOWN ON ONE SIDE.\nWalking thrice is symbolic of the three bodies. The first round is for the physical body, the body that we can see, which is available to the senses. The physical body of the Buddha is also beautiful; it is the shrine where God abides. So the first round is a salutation for the first body, the physical body. The second round is for the bliss body, the second body. And the third round is for the Buddha body, the truth body.\nThese three rounds are symbolic of something else too. In Buddhism there are three shelters, three refuges: \"I take refuge in the Buddha, I take refuge in the sangha, I take refuge in the Dhamma.\" These three rounds are symbolic of them too.\nWhen a person comes to Buddha to ask anything, he has to take refuge. He has to have this state of mind -- that \"I am falling in tune with Buddha,\" that \"I am ready to vibrate in the same wavelength.\" \"I take refuge in the Buddha. You are my shelter, I come to you as a disciple, I come to you knowing that I don't know, I come to you in innocence, I bow down to you, I recognize that you know and I don't know -- so I am ready to receive whatsoever you think I am ready to be given.\"\n\"I take refuge in the sangha, in the commune.\"... Because one Buddha is only a representative of all the Buddhas of the past and the future. One Buddha is a door to all the Buddhas. You can call the Buddhas the Christs or the Krishnas; it doesn't make any difference. These are different names given by different traditions.\nSo the first refuge is in this Buddha who is just in front of you. The second refuge is in all the Buddhas, the sangha, the commune of the Buddhas -- past, present, future. And the third refuge is in the Dhamma -- that essential being that makes a man a Buddha. That art of awakening is Dhamma, the religion.\nAT THAT TIME THE VENERABLE SUBHUTI CAME TO THAT ASSEMBLY AND SAT DOWN.\nOne of the great disciples of Buddha is Subhuti. THEN HE ROSE FROM HIS SEAT, says Ananda -- and again he repeats the whole thing. Because Subhuti is also no ordinary man. He is almost a Buddha, just on the verge of it. Any moment he is going to become a Buddha. So Ananda repeats again:\nTHEN HE ROSE FROM HIS SEAT,\nPUT HIS UPPER ROBE OVER ONE SHOULDER, PLACED HIS RIGHT KNEE ON THE GROUND, BENT FORTH HIS FOLDED HANDS TOWARDS THE LORD, AND SAID TO THE LORD:\n'IT IS WONDERFUL, O LORD,\nIT IS EXCEEDINGLY WONDERFUL, O WELL-GONE, HOW MUCH THE BODHISATTVAS,\nTHE GREAT BEINGS, HAVE BEEN HELPED\nWITH THE GREATEST HELP BY THE TATHAGATA. HOW THEN, O LORD, SHOULD ONE WHO HAS SET OUT IN THE BODHISATTVA-VEHICLE, STAND, HOW PROGRESS,\nHOW CONTROL THE THOUGHTS?'\nSubhuti is almost close to buddhahood. He is a bodhisattva. Bodhisattva means one who is ready to become a Buddha, who has come almost close to it; one step more and he will become a Buddha. Bodhisattva means bodhi-essence, bodhi- being: ready ninety-nine degrees -- and on the hundredth degree he will evaporate. But a bodhisattva is one who tries to remain a little longer at ninety- nine degrees so that he can help people out of his compassion, because once he has jumped the hundred degrees, he has gone beyond.…\nGATE GATE PARAGATE PARASAMGATE BODHISWAHA. Then he has\ngone and gone beyond and beyond. Then it will be very difficult to make contact with the people who live on this shore.\nThe greatest help is possible from those who are at the ninety-nine degree point. Why? --\nbecause they are still not enlightened. They know the ways of the people who are unenlightened. They know the language of the people who are unenlightened. They are yet with them, and yet in another sense ninety-nine percent they have gone beyond. That one percent keeps them linked, bridged.\nSo a bodhisattva is one who is close to buddhahood but is trying to remain on this shore a little longer so that he can help people. He has arrived; he would like to share his arrival.\nHe has known; he would like to share what he has known. Others are stumbling in darkness; he would like to share his light with them, his love with them.\nSubhuti is a bodhisattva. Ananda reports about him also in the same way as he reports about Buddha.\nTHEN HE ROSE FROM HIS SEAT.… Just imagine, visualize, a bodhisattva arising. He is utter awareness. He is not just rising like a robot. Each breath is known, fully known.\nNothing passes unknown. He is watchful. What the Catholic tradition calls recollectedness, that is what Buddhists call SAMMASATI -- right mindfulness.\nMindfulness or recollection, to be recollected,, to live recollectedly: SAMMASATI -- not to do a single act unconciously.\nHE ROSE FROM HIS SEAT,\nPUT HIS UPPER ROBE OVER ONE SHOULDER, PLACED HIS RIGHT KNEE ON THE GROUND, BENT FORTH HIS FOLDED HAND TOWARDS THE LORD AND SAID TO THE LORD...\nAnd remember, even a bodhisattva, who has come very close to becoming a Buddha, bows down to the Buddha in utter gratitude.\n'IT IS WONDERFUL, O LORD,\nIT IS EXCEEDINGLY WONDERFUL, O WELL-GONE '\nWell-gone means one who has gone to the other shore. Subhuti is on this shore, Buddha is on that shore. Subhuti has come to that understanding: he can see the other shore, he can see Buddha on the other shore. 'O Well-gone '\nThis word 'well-gone' has many meanings. One: one who has reached to the other shore.\nAnother one who has reached to the ultimate of meditation. Buddha has said that there are eight steps towards ultimate meditation. One who has reached to the eighth is called\n'well-gone'. But it is the same. One who has reached samadhi, the ultimate samadhi, he has gone to the other shore. he is no more -- that is what is meant by 'well-gone'. Gone, utterly gone. He is no more, he is just an emptiness. The self has disappeared, evaporated.\n'O WELL-GONE,\nIT IS WONDERFUL,\nIT IS EXCEEDINGLY WONDERFUL, HOW MUCH THE BODHISATTVAS, THE GREAT BEINGS,\nHAVE BEEN HELPED WITH THE GREATEST HELP BY THE TATHAGATA.\nTATHAGATA is the Buddhist word which means well-gone. Subhuti says, \"How much help has been given, how wonderful it is -- it is exceedingly wonderful, it is unbelievable how much you have given to us. And you go on giving, and we don't even deserve it.\"\n'... WONDERFUL, O LORD,\nIT IS EXCEEDINGLY WONDERFUL, O WELL-GONE, HOW MUCH THE BODHISATTVAS, THE GREAT BEINGS, HAVE BEEN HELPED BY THE TATHAGATA.\nHOW THEN, O LORD, SHOULD ONE\nWHO HAS SET OUT IN THE BODHISATTVA-VEHICLE...\nOne who has decided to remain on this shore a little longer to help people.\n... HOW SHOULD HE STAND, HOW PROGRESS, HOW CONTROL THE THOUGHTS?'\nWhat is he asking? He is asking a question which may not be relevant to many of you, because it becomes relevant only when you have become a bodhisattva. But some day, some day or other, you will be becoming bodhisattvas. Some day or other the question will be relevant. It is better to think about it, it is better to meditate over it.\nHe says, \"Those who have decided to be bodhisattvas, how should they stand?\" He is saying, \"The attraction of the other shore is so much, the pull of the other shore is so much -- how should they stand on this shore? We would like to help people, but how?\nThe pull is such, the magnetic pull is such -- the other shore is calling. So teach us how we can stand here, how we can become again rooted on this shore. We have become uprooted; in this world we don't have any roots. Ninety-nine percent of the roots are gone.\"\nJust think of a tree -- ninety-nine percent of the roots are gone; only one percent of the roots are there. The tree is asking, \"How should I stand now? I am going to fall, and I understand that if I can stay a little longer I will be of immense help to people, and they need it. I was in need -- you helped me. Now, others are in need -- I should help.\" That is the only way a disciple can pay his debt to the master. There is no other way. The master has helped you; the master needs no help -- how to pay the debt? what to do? The only thing to do is help somebody who is still stumbling, groping in the dark. Do whatsoever the master has done for you to others, and you have paid your debt.\nHe asked \"How to stand?\" -- it is difficult, it is almost impossible -- and \"How to progress, how to start helping people?\" -- because that too is difficult. Now we understand their miseries are all false. Now we understand that they are suffering just nightmares; their miseries are not true. Now we know they are afraid only of a rope, thinking that it is a snake. Now it is very difficult to help these people. It is ridiculous.\nAnd we know that they need help, because we know our own past. We were trembling, crying, screaming. We know how much we have suffered, although now we know that all suffering was just like a dream, it was illusory; it was\nmaya.\"\nJust think, if you know that the other person is just talking nonsense, that he has no wounds Once a man was brought to me. He had got the idea somehow that\ntwo flies had entered into his stomach -- because he sleeps with an open mouth. And the flies kept on revolving in his stomach. Naturally, if they have entered they will revolve. He was continuously worried and he was not even able to sit in one posture. He would move to this side and that and he would say, \"They have gone to this side, and now they have gone to that side.\" He was almost mad.\nNow, he had been to all the doctors and nobody was of any help, and they all laughed; they said, \"You are just imagining.\" But just to say to a person that he is imagining his misery is not of much help, because he is suffering. It may be imaginary to you, but to him it makes no difference whether the suffering is imaginary or real; he is suffering all the same. What you call it makes no difference.\nI touched his stomach and then said, \"Yes, they are there.\" He was very happy. He touched my feet, he said, \"You are the only man. I have been to many doctors and physicians -- ayurveydic and allopathic and homeopathic -- and they are all fools! And they go on insisting on one thing. I tell them, If you don't have any medicine simply say that you don't have any medicine, but why do you go on saying that I am imagining?\nNow here you are. Can't you see?\"\nI said, \"I can see perfectly -- they are there. I deal in such problems.\" I said, \"You have come to the right person. This is my whole work -- I deal in such problems which don't exist really. I am an expert in dealing with problems which are not.\" I said, \"You just lie down and close your eyes. I will have to blindfold you, and I will take them out. And you open your mouth and I will call them. A great mantra is needed.\"\nHe was very happy. He said, \"This is how it should be done.\" I blindfolded him, told him to open his mouth, and he was lying there, very happy, waiting for the flies to come out.\nAnd I rushed into the house to find two flies. It was difficult because I have never caught flies before, but somehow I managed it, and when he opened his\neyes and saw those two flies in the bottle he said, \"Now give this bottle to me. I will go to those fools.\" And he was perfectly okay. But it is very difficult to help such people, very difficult, because you know that their difficulty is all false.\nSubhuti is asking, \"Lord, first tell us how to stand here, because our roots are gone, we don't belong to this world any more. Our attachments are gone -- they are the roots. And how to progress, to work? -- because we now know that this is all just nonsense; people are imagining all their miseries. And how to control thoughts?\"\nWhat does he mean? Because a bodhisattva has no thoughts ordinarily -- not the thoughts that you have. Now there is only one thought, and that thought is of the other shore... and the other shore continuously pulls. The door is open, you can enter into utter bliss, and you are holding yourself at the door -- and the door is open.\nFirst you were searching for many lives for where the door is; then you were knocking and knocking for many lives -- now the door is open. And Buddha says, \"You wait, you remain outside the door. There are many who have to be helped.\" Naturally a great desire to enter, a great passion to enter through the door will arise. That's what he is asking.\nAFTER THESE WORDS\nTHE LORD SAID TO SUBHUTI:'THEREFORE, SUBHUTI, LISTEN WELL AND ATTENTIVELY. SOMEONE WHO HAS SET OUT\nIN THE VEHICLE OF A BODHISATTVA\nSHOULD PRODUCE A THOUGHT IN THIS MANNER;'\nIt does not look very good in the English translation. The Sanskrit word is CHITTOPAD.\nOne should create such a mind, such a decision; one should create such a great decision, determination -- CHITTOPAD -- in this manner:\n'\"AS MANY BEINGS AS THERE ARE\nIN THE UNIVERSE OF BEINGS, COMPREHENDED UNDER THE TERM 'BEINGS', ALL THESE I MUST LEAD TO NIRVANA...\"'\n\"Not one or two, Subhuti, not one or two, but all the beings -- men, women, animals, birds, trees, rocks. All the beings in the world. One should create such a determination that 'I will lead all of them into Nirvana.'\"\n'... INTO THAT REALM OF NIRVANA WHICH LEAVES NOTHING BEHIND.\nAND YET, ALTHOUGH INNUMERABLE BEINGS HAVE THUS BEEN LED TO NIRVANA;\nNO BEING AT ALL HAS BEEN LED TO NIRVANA.'\nThat too you have to remember, you should not forget; otherwise, leading others, you will fall into ignorance again.\nAll the beings have to be led to the other shore, and still you have to remember that their miseries are false, so your remedies are also false. And you have to remember that they have no selves; neither do you have any self. So don't forget; don't think that you are helping people, that you are a great helper, this and that, otherwise you will fall again.\nAgain you will grow roots on this shore.\nSo two things have to be remembered. You have to remain on this shore with great determination, otherwise you will be pulled by the other; and yet you are not to grow roots, again otherwise you will not be of any help. You will destroy yourself, you will fall into the dream again.\n'AND WHY?\nIF IN A BODHISATTVA\nTHE NOTION OF A \"BEING\" SHOULD TAKE PLACE,\nHE COULD NOT BE CALLED A \"BODHI-BEING\". AND WHY?\nHE IS NOT TO BE CALLED A \"BODHI-BEING\" IN WHOM THE NOTION OF A SELF\nOR OF A BEING SHOULD TAKE PLACE, OR THE NOTION OF A LIVING SOUL OR OF A PERSON.'\n\"So you have to remember, Subhuti, two things. One, that you have to lead all the beings to the other shore, and still you have to remember that nobody has a being -- neither you nor they. All egos are false and illusory.\n\"Go on remembering this and go on with great determination. Help people to the other shore. They are already there; you just have to make them alert and aware. But don't get lost, don't become a saviour -- these two things.\"\nAnd again and again Buddha will repeat in this sutra THE VEHICLE OF THE BODHISATTVA. I would like you all to become bodhisattvas.\nEnough for today.

A PERSON.'</p><p>I love Gautama the Buddha because he represents to me the essential
core of religion. He is not the founder of Buddhism -- Buddhism is a
byproduct -- but he is the beginner of a totally different kind of
religion in the world. He's the founder of a religionless religion.</p><p>He has propounded not religion but religiousness. And this is a great
radical change in the history of human consciousness.</p><p>Before Buddha there were religions but never a pure religiousness.
Man was not yet mature. With Buddha, humanity enters into a mature age.
All human beings have not yet entered into that, that's true, but Buddha
has heralded the path;</p><p>Buddha has opened the gateless gate. It takes time for human beings
to understand such a deep message.</p><p>Buddha's message is the deepest ever. Nobody has done the work that
Buddha has done, the way he has done. Nobody else represents pure
fragrance.</p><p>Other founders of religions, other enlightened people, have
compromised with their audience. Buddha remains uncompromised, hence his
purity. He does not care what you can understand, he cares only what the
truth is. And he says it without being worried whether you understand it
or not. In a way this looks hard; in another way this is great
compassion.</p><p>Truth has to be said as it is. The moment you compromise, the moment
you bring truth to the ordinary level of human consciousness, it loses
its soul, it becomes superficial, it becomes a dead thing. You cannot
bring truth to the level of human beings; human beings have to be led to
the level of truth. That is Buddha's great work.</p><p>Twenty-five centuries ago, just some day early in the morning -- just
like this day -- this sutra was born. Twelve hundred and fifty monks
were present. It happened in the city of Sravasti. It was a great city
of those days. The word Sravasti means the city of glory. It was one of
the glorious cities of ancient India; it had nine hundred thousand
families in it.</p><p>Now that city has completely disappeared. A very very small village
exists -- you will not find even its name on any map; even the name has
disappeared. Now it is called Sahet-Mahet. It is impossible to believe
that such a great city existed there. This is the way of life -- things
go on changing. Cities turn into cemeteries, cemeteries turn into
cities... life is a flux.</p><p>Buddha must have loved this city of Sravasti, because out of
forty-five years of his ministry he stayed in Sravasti twenty-five
years. He must have loved the people. The people must have been of a
very evolved consciousness. All the great sutras of Buddha, almost all,
were born in Sravasti.</p><p>This sutra -- The Diamond Sutra -- was also born in Sravasti. The
Sanskrit name of this sutra is Vajrachchedika Prajnaparamita Sutra. It
means perfection of wisdom which cuts like a thunderbolt. If you allow,
Buddha can cut you like a thunderbolt. He can behead you. He can kill
you and help you to be reborn.</p><p>A buddha has to be both -- a murderer and a mother. On the one hand
he has to kill, on the other hand he has to give new being to you. The
new being is possible only when the old has been destroyed. Only on the
ashes of the old the new is born. Man is a phoenix.</p><p>The mythological bird phoenix is not just a mythology, it is a
metaphor. It stands for man. That phoenix exists nowhere except in man.
Man is the being who has to die to be reborn.</p><p>That's what Jesus said to Nicodemus. Nicodemus was a professor, a
learned man, a rabbi, a member of the board that controlled the great
temple of Jerusalem. One dark night he came to see Jesus. He could not
gather courage to come to him in the day time; he was afraid what people
would say. He was so respectable, so much respected. Going to a vagabond
teacher?... going to somebody who is hated by all the rabbis and all the
learned people?... going to somebody who moves with thieves and
drunkards and prostitutes? But something in him was very desirous to see
this man. maybe he had seen Jesus walking, coming to the temple. He must
have felt something deep in his unconscious for this man.</p><p>He could not hold himself back.</p><p>One night when everybody had left, when even the disciples had gone
to sleep, he reached Jesus and he asked, "What should I do so that I can
also enter into the kingdom of God?"</p><p>And Jesus said, "Unless you die nothing is possible. If you die, only
then can you enter into the kingdom of God. You will have to die as you
are, only then can you be born as really your inner being is."</p><p>The ego has to die for the essential being to surface. That is the
meaning of Vajrachchedika Prajnaparamita. It cuts like a thunderbolt. In
one stroke it can destroy you. It is one of the greatest sermons of
Buddha. Get in tune with it.</p><p>Before we enter into the sutra, a few things to be understood that
will help you to understand it. Gautama the Buddha has started a
spirituality that is nonrepressive and nonideological. That is a very
rare phenomenon. The ordinary kind of spirituality, the garden variety,
is very repressive. It depends on repression. It does not transform man,
it only cripples man. It does not liberate man, it enslaves man. It is
oppressive, it is ugly.</p><p>Listen to these words of Thomas a Kempis, author of Imitation of
Christ. He writes: "The more violence you do to yourself, the greater
will be your growth in grace. There is no other way save of daily
mortification. To despise oneself is the best and the most perfect
counsel." There are thousands of saints down the ages who will agree
with Thomas a Kempis. And Thomas a Kempis is pathological.</p><p>Or the French priest Bossuet says: "Cursed be the earth! Cursed be
the earth! A thousand times cursed be the earth." Why? Why should the
earth be cursed? Life has to be cursed.</p><p>These people have been thinking as if God is against life, as if life
is against God. Life IS</p><p>God, there is no antagonism, there is no separation even. They are
not different things, they are two names for one reality.</p><p>Remember this: Buddha is nonrepressive. And if you find Buddhist
monks to be repressive, remember, they have not understood Buddha at
all. They have brought their own pathology into his teachings. And
Buddha is non-ideological. He gives no ideology, because all ideologies
are of the mind. And if ideologies are of the mind, they cannot take you
beyond the mind. No ideology can become a bridge to reach beyond the
mind. All ideologies have to be dropped, only then the mind will be
dropped.</p><p>Buddha believes in no ideals either -- because all ideals create
tension and conflict in man. They divide, they create anguish. You are
one thing and they want you to be something else. Between these two you
are stretched, torn apart. Ideals create misery.</p><p>Ideals create schizophrenia. The more ideals there are, the more
people will be schizophrenic, they will be split. Only a nonideological
consciousness can avoid being split. And if you are split how can you be
happy? how can you be silent? how can you know anything of peace, of
stillness?</p><p>The ideological person is continuously fighting with himself. Each
moment there is conflict. He lives in conflict, he lives in confusion,
because he cannot decide who really he is -- the ideal or the reality.
He cannot trust himself, he becomes afraid of himself, he loses
confidence. And once a man loses confidence he loses all glory. Then he
is ready to become a slave to anybody -- to any priest, to any
politician. Then he is just ready, waiting to fall in some trap.</p><p>Why do people become followers? Why are people trapped? Why do people
fall for a Joseph Stalin or an Adolf Hitler or a Mao Zedong? Why in the
first place? They have become so shaky, the ideological confusion has
shaken them from their very roots. Now they cannot stand on their own,
they want somebody to lean on. They cannot move on their own, they don't
know who they are. They need somebody to tell them that they are this or
that. They need an identity to be given to them. They have forgotten
their self and their nature.</p><p>Adolf Hitlers and Joseph Stalins and Mao Zedongs will be coming again
and again until and unless man drops all ideologies. And remember, when
I say all ideologies, I mean ALL ideologies. I don't make any
distinction between noble ideologies and not so noble.</p><p>All ideologies are dangerous. In fact the noble ideologies are more
dangerous, because they have a more seductive power, they are more
persuasive. But ideology as such is a disease, exactly a dis-ease,
because you become two: the ideal and vou. And the you that you are is
condemned,,, and the you that you are not is praised. Now you are
getting into trouble. Now sooner or later you will be neurotic,
psychotic or something.</p><p>Buddha has given a nonrepressive way of life, and nonideological too.
That's why he does not talk about God, he does not talk about heaven, he
does not talk about any future.</p><p>He does not give you anything to hold onto, he takes everything away
from you. He takes even your self. He goes on taking things away, and
finally he takes even the idea of self, I, ego. He leaves only pure
emptiness behind. And this is very difficult.</p><p>This is very difficult because we have completely forgotten how to
give. We only know how to take. We go on taking everything. I TAKE the
exam and I TAKE the wife and even I TAKE the afternoon nap -- a thing
which cannot be taken, you have to surrender to it. Sleep comes only
when you surrender. Even a wife, a husband, you go on taking. You are
not respectful. The wife is not a property. You can take a house -- how
can you take a wife or a husband? But our language shows our mind. We
don't know how to give - how to give in, how to let go, how to let
things happen.</p><p>Buddha takes all ideals away, the whole future away, and finally he
takes the last</p><p>thing that is very very difficult for us to give -- he takes your
very self, leaves a pure, innocent, virgin emptiness behind. That virgin
emptiness he calls nirvana. Nirvana is not a goal, it is just your
emptiness. When you have dropped all that you have accumulated, when you
don't hoard anymore, when you are no longer a miser and a clinger, then
suddenly that emptiness erupts. It has always been there.</p><p>Hakuin is right: "From the very beginning, all beings are buddhas."
That emptiness is there. You have accumulated junk so that emptiness is
not visible. It is just like in your house you can go on accumulating
things; then you stop seeing any space, then there is no more space. A
day comes when even to move in the house becomes difficult; to live
becomes difficult because there is no space. But space has not gone
anywhere. Think of it, meditate over it. The space has not gone
anywhere; you have accumulated too much furniture and the TV and the
radio and the radiogram and the piano and everything -- but the space
has not gone anywhere. Remove the furniture and the space is there; it
has always been there. It was hidden by the furniture but it was not
destroyed. It has not left the room, not for a single moment. So is your
inner emptiness, your nirvana, your nothingness.</p><p>Buddha does not give you nirvana as an ideal. Buddha liberates
instead of coercing.</p><p>Buddha teaches you how to live -- not for any goal, not to achieve
anything, but to be blissful herenow -- how to live in awareness. Not
that awareness is going to give you something -- awareness is not a
means to anything; it is the end in itself, the means and the end both.
Its value is intrinsic.</p><p>Buddha does not teach you otherworldliness. This has to be
understood. People are worldly; the priests go on teaching the other
world. The other world is also not very otherworldly, it cannot be,
because it is just an improved model of the same world. From where can
you create the other world? You know only this world. You can improve,
you can decorate the other world better, you can remove a few things
that are ugly here and you can replace a few things which you think will
be beautiful, but it is going to be a creation out of the experience of
this world. So your other world is not very different, cannot be. It is
a continuity. It comes out of your mind; it is a game of
imagination.</p><p>You will have beautiful women there -- of course more beautiful than
you have</p><p>here. You will have the same kinds of pleasures there -- maybe more
permanent, stable, but they will be the same kinds of pleasures. You
will have better food, more tasty -- but you will have food. You will
have houses, maybe made of gold</p><p>-- but they will be houses. You will repeat the whole thing
again.</p><p>Just go into the scriptures and see how they depict the heaven and
you will find the same world improved upon. A few touches here and a few
touches there, but it is not in any way otherworldly. That's why I say
the otherworldliness of other religions is not very otherworldly; it is
this world projected into the future. It is born out of the experience
of this world. There will not be misery and poverty and illness and
paralysis and blindness and deafness. Things that you don't like here
will not be there, and things that you like will be there and in
abundance, but it is not going to be anything new.</p><p>Mind cannot conceive of anything new. Mind is incapable of conceiving
the new. Mind lives in the old, mind IS the old. The new never happens
through the mind. The new happens only when mind is not functioning,
when mind is not controlling you, when mind has been put aside. The new
happens only when the mind is not interfering.</p><p>But all your scriptures talk about the heaven -- and the heaven or
the paradise or FIRDAUS or SWARGA, is nothing but the same story. It may
be printed on a better art paper, with better ink, in a more improved
press, with more colorful illustrations, but the story is the same; it
cannot be otherwise.</p><p>Buddha does not talk of otherworldliness or the other world. He
simply teaches you how to be here in this world; how to be here alert,
conscious, mindful, so that nothing impinges upon your emptiness; so
that your inner emptiness is not contaminated, poisoned; so that you can
live here and yet remain uncontaminated, unpolluted; so that you can be
in the world and the world will not be in you.</p><p>The otherworldly spirituality is bound to be oppressive, destructive,
sado- masochistic --</p><p>in short, pathological. Buddha's spirituality has a different flavor
to it -- the flavor of no ideal, the flavor of no future, the flavor of
no other world. It is a flower here and now. It asks for nothing. All is
already given. It simply becomes more alert so you can see more, you can
hear more, you can be more.</p><p>Remember, you are only in the same proportion as you are conscious.
If you want to be more, be more conscious. Consciousness imparts being.
Unconsciousness takes being away. When you are drunk you lose being.
When you are fast asleep you lose being.</p><p>Have you not watched it? When you are alert you have a different
quality -- you are centered, rooted. When you are alert you feel the
solidity of your being, it is almost tangible. When you are unconscious,
just dragging by, sleepy, your sense of being is less.</p><p>It is always in the same proportion as the consciousness is.</p><p>So Buddha's whole message is to be conscious. And for no other
reason, just for the sake of being conscious -- because consciousness
imparts being, consciousness creates you.</p><p>And a you so different from you that you are, that you cannot
imagine. A you where 'I'</p><p>has disappeared, where no idea of self exists, nothing defines you...
a pure emptiness, an infinity, unbounded emptiness.</p><p>This Buddha calls the state of meditation -- SAMMASAMADHI, right
state of meditation, when you are all alone. But remember, aloneness is
not loneliness. Have you ever thought about this beautiful word, alone?
It means all one. It is made of two words --</p><p>all and one. In aloneness you become one with the all.</p><p>Aloneness has nothing of loneliness in it. You are not lonely when
you are alone. You are alone but not lonely -- because you are one with
the all; how can you be lonely? You don't miss others, true. Not that
you have forgotten them, not that you don't need them, not that you
don't care about them, no. You don't remember others because you are one
with them. All the distinction between one and all is lost. One has
become the all and all has become one. This English word alone is
immensely beautiful.</p><p>Buddha says sammasamadhi is aloneness. The right meditation is to be
so utterly alone that you are one with all. Let me explain it to you. If
you are empty your boundaries disappear because emptiness can have no
boundaries. Emptiness can</p><p>only be infinite.</p><p>Emptiness cannot have any weight, emptiness cannot have any color,
emptiness cannot have any name, emptiness cannot have any form. When you
are empty, how will you divide yourself from others? -- because you
don't have any color, you don't have any name, you don't have any form,
you don't have any boundaries. How are you going to make any
distinctions? When you are empty you are one with all. You have melted
into existence, existence has merged with you. You are no more an
island, you have become the vast continent of being.</p><p>Buddha's whole message is condensed in this one word -- sammasamadhi,
right meditation. What is right meditation and what is wrong meditation?
If the meditator exists then it is wrong meditation. If the meditator is
lost in meditation then it is right meditation. Right meditation brings
you to emptiness and aloneness.</p><p>This sutra... this whole sutra is concerned with how to become
utterly empty. This is his basic gift to the world.</p><p>THUS HAVE I HEARD AT ONE TIME.</p><p>These sutras have been remembered by Buddha's great disciple Ananda.
And one thing to be remembered: all sutras start: THUS HAVE I
HEARD.…</p><p>When Buddha died all the disciples gathered together to collect
whatsoever Buddha had said in those forty-five years. Ananda was the
only one who had lived continuously for those forty-five years with
Buddha. He was the most authentic to be relied upon. Others had heard,
but they had heard from others. Sometimes they were with Buddha and
sometimes they were not with Buddha. Only Ananda had lived like a
shadow.</p><p>So Ananda relates, but the beauty is that he never says that "Buddha
said this"; he simply says, "Thus have I heard". The difference is
great. He does not say, "Buddha has said this," because he says, "How am
I to say what Buddha has said? All that I can say is this -</p><p>- that this is what I have heard. What Buddha said, only he knows.
What he meant, only he knows. All that I can remember is what I have
heard. My capacities are limited. He may have meant something else. I
may have forgotten a few words, I may have put a few words of my
own."</p><p>This is a great sincerity. He could have claimed, "This is what
Buddha said. I was present, I am an eyewitness." And he WAS an
eyewitness; nobody can deny that. But look at the humbleness of the man:
he says "Thus have I heard. Buddha was saying, I was hearing -- I can
only relate what I have heard. It may be right, it may not be right. I
may have interfered, I may have interpreted, I may have forgotten a few
things, something of my own mind may have got into it -- that all is
possible. I am not an enlightened man."</p><p>Ananda was not yet enlightened, so he says, "This is all that I can
say, I can vouch for."</p><p>THUS HAVE I HEARD AT ONE TIME. THE LORD DWELT AT SRAVASTI.</p><p>EARLY IN THE MORNING THE LORD DRESSED, PUT ON HIS CLOAK, TOOK HIS
BOWL,</p><p>AND ENTERED THE GREAT CITY OF SRAVASTI TO COLLECT ALMS.</p><p>WHEN HE HAD EATEN AND RETURNED FROM HIS ROUND, THE LORD PUT AWAY HIS
BOWL AND CLOAK, WASHED HIS FEET,</p><p>AND SAT DOWN ON THE SEAT ARRANGED FOR HIM, CROSSING HIS LEGS,</p><p>HOLDING HIS BODY UPRIGHT, AND MINDFULLY FIXING HIS ATTENTION IN FRONT
OF HIM.</p><p>This you will be surprised at. When Ananda says, he goes into very
small details. One never knows -- when you are reporting about a buddha,
you have to be very careful, mm?</p><p>Even this much he reports again and again -- such small things. EARLY
IN THE MORNING THE LORD DRESSED,</p><p>PUT ON HIS CLOAK, TOOK HIS BOWL,</p><p>AND ENTERED THE GREAT CITY OF SRAVASTI TO COLLECT ALMS.</p><p>Ananda is following him like a shadow, a silent shadow just watching
him. Just to watch him was a benediction. And he watches everything.</p><p>WHEN HE HAD EATEN AND RETURNED FROM HIS ROUND, THE LORD PUT AWAY HIS
BOWL AND CLOAK, WASHED HIS FEET,</p><p>AND SAT DOWN ON THE SEAT ARRANGED FOR HIM.</p><p>When for the first time Buddhist sutras were translated into Western
languages, the translators were a little bit puzzled -- why this
continuous repetition? It goes on and on like that; again it will be,
again this repetition. Why are these small things related? They could
not understand it. They thought that this is repetitive, that this is a
very unnecessary repetition; it is not needed at all. What is the point
of it all? But they missed. What Ananda is saying is that Buddha pays
attention to small things as much as to big things.</p><p>For a buddha there is nothing small and nothing big -- one thing.</p><p>When he takes his bowl he is as respectful to the bowl as he would be
respectful to any God. When he puts his cloak or puts his dress on he is
so mindful; he's absolutely alert, he is not mechanical. When you put
your dress on you are mechanical. You know mechanically how to put it
on, so what is the point of paying attention to it? Your mind goes on
moving into a thousand directions. And you take a shower -- but you are
very disrespectful to the shower. You have not been there, you have been
somewhere else.</p><p>You eat, but you are disrespectful to the food. You are not there,
you simply go</p><p>on swallowing the food inside you. You go on doing your things
habitually, mechanically.</p><p>When Buddha does a thing he is utterly there, he is nowhere else.
WHEN HE HAD EATEN AND RETURNED</p><p>FROM HIS ROUND, THE LORD PUT AWAY HIS BOWL AND CLOAK, WASHED HIS
FEET,</p><p>AND SAT DOWN ON THE SEAT ARRANGED FOR HIM, CROSSING HIS LEGS,</p><p>HOLDING HIS BODY UPRIGHT, AND MINDFULLY FIXING HIS ATTENTION IN FRONT
OF HIM.…</p><p>These minor details are worth relating, because they bring the
quality of buddhahood.</p><p>Each moment he lives in awareness. What he is doing is irrelevant;
each moment he pours his attention into whatsoever he is doing. When he
makes a gesture he is totally the gesture. When he smiles he is totally
the smile. When he talks he is totally his words.</p><p>And when he is silent he is totally silent.</p><p>To watch a buddha is a blessing in itself -- how he walks, how he
sits, how he makes gestures, how he looks at you. Each moment is a
radiant moment of awareness. That's why Ananda reports. There must have
been great silence when Buddha came, arranged his dress, washed his
feet, sat on the seat arranged for him, sat upright, then focussed his
whole attention in front of him. What is this 'fixing your attention in
front of yourself'?</p><p>That is a special Buddhist method called ANAPANSATIYOGA --
mindfulness of breath coming in and breath going out. That is the
meaning of focussing your attention in front.</p><p>When Buddha is doing something, for example dressing, then he is
attentive of that act.</p><p>When he is walking he is attentive of walking. When he is not doing
anything then he is attentive of breath coming in and breath going out.
But he is attentive; even while he is asleep he is attentive.</p><p>Ananda asked Buddha once.… For ten years he lived with Buddha and he
was surprised that he remained in the same posture the whole night.
Wherever he put his hand, he kept it there the whole night. He must have
looked many times, must have sneaked in in the night. It was worth it,
mm? -- how the Buddha sleeps? And he was surprised and puzzled that he
kept the same posture -- the same posture the whole night. He could not
hold his curiosity. One day he said, "It is not right for me to get up
in the night and look at you, I should not do such a thing, but I am
curious about you and I am puzzled -- you remain in the same posture? Do
you sleep or do you continue your awareness?"</p><p>And Buddha said, "Sleep happens in the body, I remain alert. Now the
sleep is coming, now it has come, now it has settled, now the body is
relaxed, the limbs are relaxed -- but I keep my awareness bright."</p><p>Meditation is a twenty-four hour thing. It is not that you do it once
a day and you are finished with it. It has to become your flavor, it has
to become your climate. It should surround you wherever you are,
whatsoever you are doing.</p><p>... AND MINDFULLY FIXING HIS ATTENTION IN FRONT OF HIM, HE SAT.</p><p>THEN MANY MONKS APPROACHED TO WHERE THE LORD WAS,</p><p>SALUTED HIS FEET WITH THEIR HEADS, THRICE WALKED ROUND HIM TO THE
RIGHT AND SAT DOWN ON ONE SIDE.</p><p>To ask a question to a Buddha needs a certain attitude, only then
will you receive</p><p>the answer. Not that Buddha will not give the answer. You can ask
very disrespectfully --</p><p>Buddha will give the answer, but you will not receive it. So it is
not a question that only when you are respectful will Buddha give the
answer. Buddha will give the answer anyway, but if you are not very
respectful, very humble, receptive, feminine, you will miss it. How you
ask the question determines whether you will be able to receive the
answer or not.</p><p>How you ask, in what mood Are you receptive? Are you just curious?
Are you</p><p>asking the question out of your accumulated knowledge or is your
question innocent? Are you asking just to test whether this man knows or
not? Are you asking from a state of knowledge or from a state of not
knowing? Are you humble, surrendered? Are you ready to receive the gift
if it is given to you? will you be open, will you welcome it? will you
take it to your heart? Will you allow it to become a seed in your heart?
To ask a question to a Buddha is not to ask a question to a professor.
It needs a certain quality in you; then only will you be benefited by
it.</p><p>THEN MANY MONKS APPROACHED TO WHERE THE LORD WAS,</p><p>SALUTED HIS FEET WITH THEIR HEADS, THRICE WALKED ROUND HIM TO THE
RIGHT AND SAT DOWN ON ONE SIDE.</p><p>Walking thrice is symbolic of the three bodies. The first round is
for the physical body, the body that we can see, which is available to
the senses. The physical body of the Buddha is also beautiful; it is the
shrine where God abides. So the first round is a salutation for the
first body, the physical body. The second round is for the bliss body,
the second body. And the third round is for the Buddha body, the truth
body.</p><p>These three rounds are symbolic of something else too. In Buddhism
there are three shelters, three refuges: "I take refuge in the Buddha, I
take refuge in the sangha, I take refuge in the Dhamma." These three
rounds are symbolic of them too.</p><p>When a person comes to Buddha to ask anything, he has to take refuge.
He has to have this state of mind -- that "I am falling in tune with
Buddha," that "I am ready to vibrate in the same wavelength." "I take
refuge in the Buddha. You are my shelter, I come to you as a disciple, I
come to you knowing that I don't know, I come to you in innocence, I bow
down to you, I recognize that you know and I don't know -- so I am ready
to receive whatsoever you think I am ready to be given."</p><p>"I take refuge in the sangha, in the commune."... Because one Buddha
is only a representative of all the Buddhas of the past and the future.
One Buddha is a door to all the Buddhas. You can call the Buddhas the
Christs or the Krishnas; it doesn't make any difference. These are
different names given by different traditions.</p><p>So the first refuge is in this Buddha who is just in front of you.
The second refuge is in all the Buddhas, the sangha, the commune of the
Buddhas -- past, present, future. And the third refuge is in the Dhamma
-- that essential being that makes a man a Buddha. That art of awakening
is Dhamma, the religion.</p><p>AT THAT TIME THE VENERABLE SUBHUTI CAME TO THAT ASSEMBLY AND SAT
DOWN.</p><p>One of the great disciples of Buddha is Subhuti. THEN HE ROSE FROM
HIS SEAT, says Ananda -- and again he repeats the whole thing. Because
Subhuti is also no ordinary man. He is almost a Buddha, just on the
verge of it. Any moment he is going to become a Buddha. So Ananda
repeats again:</p><p>THEN HE ROSE FROM HIS SEAT,</p><p>PUT HIS UPPER ROBE OVER ONE SHOULDER, PLACED HIS RIGHT KNEE ON THE
GROUND, BENT FORTH HIS FOLDED HANDS TOWARDS THE LORD, AND SAID TO THE
LORD:</p><p>'IT IS WONDERFUL, O LORD,</p><p>IT IS EXCEEDINGLY WONDERFUL, O WELL-GONE, HOW MUCH THE
BODHISATTVAS,</p><p>THE GREAT BEINGS, HAVE BEEN HELPED</p><p>WITH THE GREATEST HELP BY THE TATHAGATA. HOW THEN, O LORD, SHOULD ONE
WHO HAS SET OUT IN THE BODHISATTVA-VEHICLE, STAND, HOW PROGRESS,</p><p>HOW CONTROL THE THOUGHTS?'</p><p>Subhuti is almost close to buddhahood. He is a bodhisattva.
Bodhisattva means one who is ready to become a Buddha, who has come
almost close to it; one step more and he will become a Buddha.
Bodhisattva means bodhi-essence, bodhi- being: ready ninety-nine degrees
-- and on the hundredth degree he will evaporate. But a bodhisattva is
one who tries to remain a little longer at ninety- nine degrees so that
he can help people out of his compassion, because once he has jumped the
hundred degrees, he has gone beyond.…</p><p>GATE GATE PARAGATE PARASAMGATE BODHISWAHA. Then he has</p><p>gone and gone beyond and beyond. Then it will be very difficult to
make contact with the people who live on this shore.</p><p>The greatest help is possible from those who are at the ninety-nine
degree point. Why? --</p><p>because they are still not enlightened. They know the ways of the
people who are unenlightened. They know the language of the people who
are unenlightened. They are yet with them, and yet in another sense
ninety-nine percent they have gone beyond. That one percent keeps them
linked, bridged.</p><p>So a bodhisattva is one who is close to buddhahood but is trying to
remain on this shore a little longer so that he can help people. He has
arrived; he would like to share his arrival.</p><p>He has known; he would like to share what he has known. Others are
stumbling in darkness; he would like to share his light with them, his
love with them.</p><p>Subhuti is a bodhisattva. Ananda reports about him also in the same
way as he reports about Buddha.</p><p>THEN HE ROSE FROM HIS SEAT.… Just imagine, visualize, a bodhisattva
arising. He is utter awareness. He is not just rising like a robot. Each
breath is known, fully known.</p><p>Nothing passes unknown. He is watchful. What the Catholic tradition
calls recollectedness, that is what Buddhists call SAMMASATI -- right
mindfulness.</p><p>Mindfulness or recollection, to be recollected,, to live
recollectedly: SAMMASATI -- not to do a single act unconciously.</p><p>HE ROSE FROM HIS SEAT,</p><p>PUT HIS UPPER ROBE OVER ONE SHOULDER, PLACED HIS RIGHT KNEE ON THE
GROUND, BENT FORTH HIS FOLDED HAND TOWARDS THE LORD AND SAID TO THE
LORD...</p><p>And remember, even a bodhisattva, who has come very close to becoming
a Buddha, bows down to the Buddha in utter gratitude.</p><p>'IT IS WONDERFUL, O LORD,</p><p>IT IS EXCEEDINGLY WONDERFUL, O WELL-GONE '</p><p>Well-gone means one who has gone to the other shore. Subhuti is on
this shore, Buddha is on that shore. Subhuti has come to that
understanding: he can see the other shore, he can see Buddha on the
other shore. 'O Well-gone '</p><p>This word 'well-gone' has many meanings. One: one who has reached to
the other shore.</p><p>Another one who has reached to the ultimate of meditation. Buddha has
said that there are eight steps towards ultimate meditation. One who has
reached to the eighth is called</p><p>'well-gone'. But it is the same. One who has reached samadhi, the
ultimate samadhi, he has gone to the other shore. he is no more -- that
is what is meant by 'well-gone'. Gone, utterly gone. He is no more, he
is just an emptiness. The self has disappeared, evaporated.</p><p>'O WELL-GONE,</p><p>IT IS WONDERFUL,</p><p>IT IS EXCEEDINGLY WONDERFUL, HOW MUCH THE BODHISATTVAS, THE GREAT
BEINGS,</p><p>HAVE BEEN HELPED WITH THE GREATEST HELP BY THE TATHAGATA.</p><p>TATHAGATA is the Buddhist word which means well-gone. Subhuti says,
"How much help has been given, how wonderful it is -- it is exceedingly
wonderful, it is unbelievable how much you have given to us. And you go
on giving, and we don't even deserve it."</p><p>'... WONDERFUL, O LORD,</p><p>IT IS EXCEEDINGLY WONDERFUL, O WELL-GONE, HOW MUCH THE BODHISATTVAS,
THE GREAT BEINGS, HAVE BEEN HELPED BY THE TATHAGATA.</p><p>HOW THEN, O LORD, SHOULD ONE</p><p>WHO HAS SET OUT IN THE BODHISATTVA-VEHICLE...</p><p>One who has decided to remain on this shore a little longer to help
people.</p><p>... HOW SHOULD HE STAND, HOW PROGRESS, HOW CONTROL THE THOUGHTS?'</p><p>What is he asking? He is asking a question which may not be relevant
to many of you, because it becomes relevant only when you have become a
bodhisattva. But some day, some day or other, you will be becoming
bodhisattvas. Some day or other the question will be relevant. It is
better to think about it, it is better to meditate over it.</p><p>He says, "Those who have decided to be bodhisattvas, how should they
stand?" He is saying, "The attraction of the other shore is so much, the
pull of the other shore is so much -- how should they stand on this
shore? We would like to help people, but how?</p><p>The pull is such, the magnetic pull is such -- the other shore is
calling. So teach us how we can stand here, how we can become again
rooted on this shore. We have become uprooted; in this world we don't
have any roots. Ninety-nine percent of the roots are gone."</p><p>Just think of a tree -- ninety-nine percent of the roots are gone;
only one percent of the roots are there. The tree is asking, "How should
I stand now? I am going to fall, and I understand that if I can stay a
little longer I will be of immense help to people, and they need it. I
was in need -- you helped me. Now, others are in need -- I should help."
That is the only way a disciple can pay his debt to the master. There is
no other way. The master has helped you; the master needs no help -- how
to pay the debt? what to do? The only thing to do is help somebody who
is still stumbling, groping in the dark. Do whatsoever the master has
done for you to others, and you have paid your debt.</p><p>He asked "How to stand?" -- it is difficult, it is almost impossible
-- and "How to progress, how to start helping people?" -- because that
too is difficult. Now we understand their miseries are all false. Now we
understand that they are suffering just nightmares; their miseries are
not true. Now we know they are afraid only of a rope, thinking that it
is a snake. Now it is very difficult to help these people. It is
ridiculous.</p><p>And we know that they need help, because we know our own past. We
were trembling, crying, screaming. We know how much we have suffered,
although now we know that all suffering was just like a dream, it was
illusory; it was</p><p>maya."</p><p>Just think, if you know that the other person is just talking
nonsense, that he has no wounds Once a man was brought to me. He had got
the idea somehow that</p><p>two flies had entered into his stomach -- because he sleeps with an
open mouth. And the flies kept on revolving in his stomach. Naturally,
if they have entered they will revolve. He was continuously worried and
he was not even able to sit in one posture. He would move to this side
and that and he would say, "They have gone to this side, and now they
have gone to that side." He was almost mad.</p><p>Now, he had been to all the doctors and nobody was of any help, and
they all laughed; they said, "You are just imagining." But just to say
to a person that he is imagining his misery is not of much help, because
he is suffering. It may be imaginary to you, but to him it makes no
difference whether the suffering is imaginary or real; he is suffering
all the same. What you call it makes no difference.</p><p>I touched his stomach and then said, "Yes, they are there." He was
very happy. He touched my feet, he said, "You are the only man. I have
been to many doctors and physicians -- ayurveydic and allopathic and
homeopathic -- and they are all fools! And they go on insisting on one
thing. I tell them, If you don't have any medicine simply say that you
don't have any medicine, but why do you go on saying that I am
imagining?</p><p>Now here you are. Can't you see?"</p><p>I said, "I can see perfectly -- they are there. I deal in such
problems." I said, "You have come to the right person. This is my whole
work -- I deal in such problems which don't exist really. I am an expert
in dealing with problems which are not." I said, "You just lie down and
close your eyes. I will have to blindfold you, and I will take them out.
And you open your mouth and I will call them. A great mantra is
needed."</p><p>He was very happy. He said, "This is how it should be done." I
blindfolded him, told him to open his mouth, and he was lying there,
very happy, waiting for the flies to come out.</p><p>And I rushed into the house to find two flies. It was difficult
because I have never caught flies before, but somehow I managed it, and
when he opened his</p><p>eyes and saw those two flies in the bottle he said, "Now give this
bottle to me. I will go to those fools." And he was perfectly okay. But
it is very difficult to help such people, very difficult, because you
know that their difficulty is all false.</p><p>Subhuti is asking, "Lord, first tell us how to stand here, because
our roots are gone, we don't belong to this world any more. Our
attachments are gone -- they are the roots. And how to progress, to
work? -- because we now know that this is all just nonsense; people are
imagining all their miseries. And how to control thoughts?"</p><p>What does he mean? Because a bodhisattva has no thoughts ordinarily
-- not the thoughts that you have. Now there is only one thought, and
that thought is of the other shore... and the other shore continuously
pulls. The door is open, you can enter into utter bliss, and you are
holding yourself at the door -- and the door is open.</p><p>First you were searching for many lives for where the door is; then
you were knocking and knocking for many lives -- now the door is open.
And Buddha says, "You wait, you remain outside the door. There are many
who have to be helped." Naturally a great desire to enter, a great
passion to enter through the door will arise. That's what he is
asking.</p><p>AFTER THESE WORDS</p><p>THE LORD SAID TO SUBHUTI:'THEREFORE, SUBHUTI, LISTEN WELL AND
ATTENTIVELY. SOMEONE WHO HAS SET OUT</p><p>IN THE VEHICLE OF A BODHISATTVA</p><p>SHOULD PRODUCE A THOUGHT IN THIS MANNER;'</p><p>It does not look very good in the English translation. The Sanskrit
word is CHITTOPAD.</p><p>One should create such a mind, such a decision; one should create
such a great decision, determination -- CHITTOPAD -- in this manner:</p><p>'"AS MANY BEINGS AS THERE ARE</p><p>IN THE UNIVERSE OF BEINGS, COMPREHENDED UNDER THE TERM 'BEINGS', ALL
THESE I MUST LEAD TO NIRVANA..."'</p><p>"Not one or two, Subhuti, not one or two, but all the beings -- men,
women, animals, birds, trees, rocks. All the beings in the world. One
should create such a determination that 'I will lead all of them into
Nirvana.'"</p><p>'... INTO THAT REALM OF NIRVANA WHICH LEAVES NOTHING BEHIND.</p><p>AND YET, ALTHOUGH INNUMERABLE BEINGS HAVE THUS BEEN LED TO
NIRVANA;</p><p>NO BEING AT ALL HAS BEEN LED TO NIRVANA.'</p><p>That too you have to remember, you should not forget; otherwise,
leading others, you will fall into ignorance again.</p><p>All the beings have to be led to the other shore, and still you have
to remember that their miseries are false, so your remedies are also
false. And you have to remember that they have no selves; neither do you
have any self. So don't forget; don't think that you are helping people,
that you are a great helper, this and that, otherwise you will fall
again.</p><p>Again you will grow roots on this shore.</p><p>So two things have to be remembered. You have to remain on this shore
with great determination, otherwise you will be pulled by the other; and
yet you are not to grow roots, again otherwise you will not be of any
help. You will destroy yourself, you will fall into the dream again.</p><p>'AND WHY?</p><p>IF IN A BODHISATTVA</p><p>THE NOTION OF A "BEING" SHOULD TAKE PLACE,</p><p>HE COULD NOT BE CALLED A "BODHI-BEING". AND WHY?</p><p>HE IS NOT TO BE CALLED A "BODHI-BEING" IN WHOM THE NOTION OF A
SELF</p><p>OR OF A BEING SHOULD TAKE PLACE, OR THE NOTION OF A LIVING SOUL OR OF
A PERSON.'</p><p>"So you have to remember, Subhuti, two things. One, that you have to
lead all the beings to the other shore, and still you have to remember
that nobody has a being -- neither you nor they. All egos are false and
illusory.</p><p>"Go on remembering this and go on with great determination. Help
people to the other shore. They are already there; you just have to make
them alert and aware. But don't get lost, don't become a saviour --
these two things."</p><p>And again and again Buddha will repeat in this sutra THE VEHICLE OF
THE BODHISATTVA. I would like you all to become bodhisattvas.</p><p>Enough for today. The Diamond Sutra Chapter #2</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

The first question:
BELOVED OSHO,
Question 1
WHY HAVE ALL THE GREAT MASTERS COME FROM THE EAST?
Because humanity has yet not been total. The East is introvert, the West is extrovert. Man is split, mind is schizophrenic. That&#39;s why all the great masters have come from the East and all the great scientists have come from the West.</description>

WHAT IS ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT BODHISATTVAS? I DON&#39;T BELIEVE A WORD OF IT. THERE IS NO SUCH THING.

The first question:
BELOVED OSHO,
Question 1
WHAT HAS GONE WRONG? WHY IS IT THAT PEOPLE MEET EVERYTHING
NEW RELUCTANTLY, AND WITH FEAR, RATHER THAN WITH EAGER JOY?
The new does not arise out of you, it comes from the beyond.</description>

The first question:
BELOVED OSHO,
Question 1
EVEN IN MY RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU, WORDS BECOME LESS IMPORTANT
ALL THE TIME. WHY SHOULD A BUDDHA AND A BODHISATTVA NEED TO
TALK AT ALL?
What are you talking about, about what talk? It never happened.</description>

WHY SHOULD A BUDDHA AND A BODHISATTVA NEED TO\nTALK AT ALL?\nWhat are you talking about, about what talk? It never happened. Nobody has said anything and nobody has heard anything. The Diamond Sutra has no sutras in it, Mahasattva, that's why it is called The Diamond Sutra. It is an utter emptiness. If you get caught in the words you will miss the message.\nThe Diamond Sutra is absolutely empty, there is no message in it. There is nothing to read and nothing to hear. It is utter silence. If you read something in The Diamond Sutra you have missed it. If you find some doctrine in it, some philosophy in it, then you must be imagining, it must be your dream. Buddha has not talked anything, neither has Subhuti heard anything.\nIn that non-talking and non-hearing, something has happened -- something which is beyond words. Ananda has tried to capture that for you in words, but it was not delivered in words. It was a communion between two emptinesses.\nYou just go to the sea and you see the morning, and the fresh air and the sunrays and the waves, and you come home and you relate to somebody what you have seen. Then you relate only words. The word sea is not the sea and the word sun is not the sun and the word freshness is not freshness. How do you commune? You have come back from the beach and your beloved asks, \"What happened?\" You bring all that has happened into words, knowing perfectly well that it cannot be brought into words, it cannot be reduced into words. Words are so pale.\nSomething has certainly happened between Buddha and Subhuti, something which is transcendental. Maybe they had just looked into each other's eyes. Something was triggered in the consciousness of Subhuti by Buddha's presence. Ananda is trying to report it for you. You are blind. You cannot see light, you can only hear the word light.\nSo remember: The Diamond Sutra is not a sutra at all, that's why it is called The Diamond Sutra, the most precious, because it contains no philosophy, no system, no theory. It contains no words, it is an empty book.\nIf you can forget the words and you can go deeper into the gaps between the words, if you can forget the lines and can go deeper between the lines, in the intervals, in the pauses, then you will find what has happened. It is not a verbal communication.\nI am also talking to you, but still I would like to remind you to remember that my message is not in my words. You will have to step upon the words to get it.\nUse the words as a staircase, as stepping stones. Remember, stepping stones can become hindrances if you don't know how to step over them.\nYou have to listen in silence to silence.\nMahasattva, Buddha has not said a single word, neither has Subhuti heard a single word.\nIt is the compassion of Ananda to make a few maps for you. Those maps are not the countries. If you have a map of India, that map is not India, it cannot be. How can it be?\nBut it can be of some limited help to you; it can lead you to the real India. It is like the arrow on the milestone by the side of the road, it points towards something.\nThis whole Diamond Sutra points towards silence. Hence so many contradictions in it, because only through contradictions can silence be created. Each word has to be contradicted by its opposite immediately it is uttered so that they destroy each other and in the wake, silence is felt.\nThe second question:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nQuestion 2\nTHE DEEPER INTO MYSELF, THE MORE ALONE I FEEL. THERE IS ONLY\nNOTHINGNESS. AND SOMETIMES, LOOKING INTO YOUR EYES, I GET THE\nSAME FEELING OF A VAST EMPTINESS.\nIF IT IS NATURAL -- IF BEING ALONE IS BASIC, THE VERY ESSENCE OF MY\nBEING -- THEN HOW COULD THE ILLUSIVE IDEA OF BECOMING ONE, OF\nFALLING IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY ETERNALLY, COME INTO BEING IN\nTHE FIRST PLACE? AND WHY IS IT SO PAINFUL TO BECOME AWARE THAT\nIT IS AN ILLUSION? PLEASE CLEAR MY DOUBTS.\nYou are the doubter and you are the doubt. There is no other doubt. First, when you say,\n\"The deeper I fall into myself, the more alone I feel,\" if you have really been falling deeper you will feel aloneness but you will not feel \"I am alone,\" because then there are two things, I and aloneness. Then you are not alone. Then there is the experiencer and the experienced, the observer and the observed. Then you are not alone; the other is there --\nthe experience is the other.\nWhen you really fall deep into yourself, you will not find yourself; that is the whole thing to understand. It is only on the surface that the waves exist. If you go deeper into the ocean you will not find waves, or can you? How can you find waves in the depth? They exist only on the surface, they can exist only on the surface. They need winds to exist.\nThe 'I' can exist only on the surface because it needs thou, the wind of the thou to exist.\nWhen you go deeper into yourself the winds are no longer there, thous are no longer there. How can there be 'I'? I and thou exist in a pair, they are never divorced. Yes, you will find aloneness, but not I-ness. And aloneness is beautiful. Let me remind you again, the word alone means all one. That's how it is constructed -- all one. On the surface you are separate from all. In fact on the surface you are lonely because you are separate from the all. In the depth, when you have disappeared, there is no distinction between you and all. All is one, you are no longer, aloneness is.\nYou say, \"The deeper I fall into myself the more alone I feel.\" You must be imagining that you are falling deeper into yourself. The mind can go on playing games. It can play the game of being alone, it can play the game of being in\nprayer, it can play the game of being in meditation, but if 'I' remains then you can be certain it is a game, nothing real has happened. That's why again the desire for the other will arise.\nThe 'I' cannot exist alone. It needs the other to support it, to feed it, to nourish it. It will bring you back to the other. That's why when you are lonely you start thinking of your beloved, of your friend, of your mother, father, this and that, a thousand and one things.\nYou create imaginary 'thous'. If a man is put in isolation for more than three weeks he starts talking to himself. He creates the whole dialogue. He himself is divided in two -- I and thou. He becomes two so the game call be played. 'I' cannot exist separate from\n'thou'.\n\"The deeper I fall into myself, the more alone I feel.\"\nNo, you must be feeling lonely. Never use these two words as synonymous. Loneliness is negative, aloneness is positive. Loneliness simply means you are missing the other. The other is absent, there is a gap in you. Aloneness means you are present, there is no gap in you. You are full of presence, you are utterly there. Loneliness is the absence of the other, aloneness is the presence of your eternal being.\nYou say \"there is only nothingness.\" No, if there is only nothingness then there is no problem. If there is only nothingness and nobody to know it, nobody to feel it, then there is no problem. Then from where comes the doubt? How can the doubter arise? No, you are there. That nothingness is bogus because you are there. How can it be nothingness? It is just your idea.\nThis used to happen in my family when I was a child. I was so lazy -- I am still -\n- I was so lazy, utterly lazy, that my family lost all hope with me. By and by they started forgetting about me, because I would never do anything. I would sit in the corner and just sit, either with closed eyes or with open eyes, but I was so absent to them that by and by they became oblivious to me.\nSometimes it would happen that my mother would need something from the market, vegetables or something, and I would be sitting in front of her and she would say,\n\"Nobody seems to be present here.\" She was just sitting in front of me and talking to me,\n\"Nobody seems to be here. I want somebody to go and fetch vegetables from the market.\"\nAnd I was sitting in front of her and she said, \"Nobody is here.\"\nI was counted as nobody. Even if a stray dog would enter in the house I would allow it. I was sitting at the gate and the dog would enter and I would watch. And my mother would come rushing out and she would say, \"nobody is here to prevent this dog\" -- and I was sitting there!\nBy and by they had accepted that I was as if not. But that does not make much difference; I was there. I had seen the dog coming, I was hearing their words. I knew I could manage to go to the market-place and fetch vegetables for her. And I would laugh at the whole idea -- that she went on saying that nobody was there.\nThat's what is happening to you. You are there, and you say nothingness is. You are oblivious of yourself, you don't take note of yourself, otherwise you are there. If you are not there, who is saying that nothingness is? Then there is nothingness when you are not there, then there is pure nothingness. In that purity is nirvana, enlightenment. That is the most valuable place to be, the most spacious place to be. It is the space everybody is searching for, because it is unlimited, infinite. And its purity is absolute. It is not polluted by anything; even you are not there. There is light and there is consciousness, but there is no 'I'. 'I' is like ice, frozen consciousness. Consciousness is like melted ice, liquid, or, even better, even the water has evaporated, has become invisible.\nAnd you say: \"And why is it so painful to become aware that it is an illusion?\" -- the other. It is painful because the I starts dying. To recognize the other as the illusion, to recognize love as illusion, is very hard, because then the I starts dying. If you drop the you, the I cannot exist. And you don't know the beauty of dropping the I.\nAnd you ask: \"If it is natural -- if being alone is basic, the very essence of my being --\nthen how could the illusive idea of becoming one, of falling in love with somebody eternally, come into being in the first place?\"\nIt came only because of that -- because aloneness is basic, essential. The Hindu scriptures say that God was alone. Just think, just visualize God alone and alone and alone for eternity. He became fed up with his aloneness, it was monotonous. He wanted to have a little play. He created the other and started playing hide- and-seek.\nWhen you are tired of the play, when you become fed up with the play, you become a Buddha again. You again drop your toys. They are created by you, the value is imagined by you; you have put the value on them. The moment you withdraw your value they disappear, you are again alone.\nThe Hindu concept is tremendously valuable, significant. It says God was alone, it became monotonous, and he created the world, the other, just to have a little chitchat with the other, to have a little dialogue. Then again and again one comes and feels tired and bored with the other, disappears into oneself, again reaches to one's nothingness and becomes a god.\nYou are all gods who are deceiving themselves. It is your choice. The day you choose not to be this way you will be free. It is your dream. Because of aloneness, because aloneness is the essential quality of your being, the other has been created.\nYou just try it, go for a few weeks to the mountains and sit alone and you will feel very good. Everybody is tired of relationship and fed up and bored. Go to the mountains and sit silently and you will feel so beautiful, but after three or four days, five days, seven days, three weeks, you will start thinking of the other. Your woman again starts being attractive to you. You forget all the nastiness and all the nagging. You forget all that she has been doing to you, you completely forget all. She is again beautiful, she is again lovely, she is again fantastic, mm? -\n- you put value again.\nThen you have to come down from the mountains to the plains, and for two or three days with the woman things are going beautifully -- a new honeymoon and after two or three days things become difficult again, and again you start thinking how to meditate, how to be silent. This is how you go on. Just watch your consciousness and its fluctuations and through it you will know the whole process of existence, because you are a miniature existence.\nThe pendulum of consciousness goes on swinging between meditation and love,\nbetween aloneness and togetherness. And because all the religions of the world up to now have been either of love or of meditation, they were fragmentary, they were not total. I am giving you the total religion. I am not choosing.\nFor example, Buddha had chosen meditation. He gives you the love for meditation, no other love. He teaches you only to be alone, absolutely alone and nothing else. It is good, it is tremendously good for people who are tired and fed up with the world.\nHe was tired and fed up with the world. He was a king, he was not a beggar. He was tired of women. His father had brought all the beautiful girls from the kingdom for him. He had one of the most beautiful harems. If you get all the beautiful women of the world in your house, how long will you be able to live there? Just think of it: one is more than enough. Now all the beautiful women of the kingdom were there. It must have been maddening. If he escaped, it is no wonder. All the pleasures were arranged for him, every kind of pleasure was arranged for him. If he became fed up, it is no wonder. He moved to the other pole. The other was too much. He escaped into the jungle, he became alone.\nThere are religions which are religions of meditation -- Buddhism, Jainism. There are religions which are religions of love -- Christianity, Mohammedanism. And this has to be understood. Jesus is a poor man, so is Mohammed. This can't be accidental. Mahavira is a king, so is Buddha. The two kings have given to the world the religion of meditation, and the two poor people of the world have given the religion of love.\nThe poor cannot be fed up with the other. The poor has not had that much of the other.\nThe poor hankers for the other. The other may be the woman or money or power or prestige or God; it makes no difference -- the other is needed.\nChristianity and Islam are both religions of prayer, love -- love for God, prayer for God.\nIn Buddhism, in Jainism, there is no place for God at all because there is no place for the other. Aloneness is enough. In Jainism and in Buddhism there is no existence of anything like prayer, the word has not been heard; they know only of meditation. Christianity knows nothing of meditation. These are not accidental things, they show something about the founders.\nI am giving you a total religion, a religion which allows both. When you are feeling tired with the other, move into meditation, swing into meditation. When you are feeling tired of aloneness, swing into love. Both are good. Both are contradictory, but through contradiction great joy arises. If you have only one you will not have that kind of richness. The one can give you silence or can give you great joy, but both can give you something infinitely precious, incomparable. Both together, they can give you a silent ecstasy, a peaceful joy. At the innermost core you remain utterly silent, and on the periphery, the dance. And when silence dances or silence sings, that is the richest, the peakest of peaks. Hence my insistence for both.\nGeorge Bernard Shaw once at a party was sitting alone at the edge of the room. His hostess came over to him and inquired solicitously, \"Aren't you enjoying yourself?\"\nShaw replied, \"That's all I am enjoying.\"\nHe has hit upon a great truth, a great insight is there: one's self is all anyone can enjoy.\nLife starts taking the quality of silence. But if you can enjoy only yourself and never the other then you will miss the other dimension. One should be capable of enjoying oneself and the other too. That's what I call the whole man, the holy man.\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3 OSHO,\nWHEN I HEAR YOUR DISCOURSES AND AT OTHER TIMES, I KNOW THAT I KNOW ALL THAT IS NEEDED TO BE ENLIGHTENED. AT THOSE TIMES AM I ENLIGHTENED? PLEASE COMMENT ON HOW THIS OBVIOUSLY\nSUPERFICIAL 'KNOWING' CAN PENETRATE AND BECOME BEINGNESS. IT\nSEEMS THAT THIS KNOWING IS ROBBING ME OF INNOCENCE AND\nMORE\nCOMPLETE EXPERIENTIAL REALIZATION, THAT KNOWLEDGE HAS FAR\nOUTSPACED THE GROWTH OF MY BEING, AND YET, KNOWING THERE IS NO\nSUCH THING AS MY BEING, I DON'T FEEL WHOLLY MOTIVATED TOWARDS\nGROWING ONE.\nThe first thing, you say: \"When I hear your discourses and at other times I know that I know all that is needed to be enlightened.\"\nNothing is needed to be enlightened, so how can you know all that is needed to be enlightened? Nothing is needed to be enlightened. Enlightenment is your natural state; it is not something that has to he produced, manufactured, created. If you are manufacturing something new, then many things will be needed. If you are not manufacturing anything new, what is needed? You are enlightened. How can anything be needed? Nothing is needed.\nSo your idea that you think \"I know that I know all that is needed to be enlightened\" is barring your way. Nothing is needed to be enlightened and nothing is needed to be known to be enlightened. Enlightenment is already there, is already the case. It is not a realization, it is only a recognition. It is not that you have to make efforts to bring it; all that you need is not to make any effort. Drop all efforts -- and suddenly it is there. You cannot see it because you are continuously making efforts to see it. Your very effort to see it is functioning as a barrier.\nAnd you say: \"At those times am I enlightened?\" You are enlightened all the time, not when you hear me, not when you read something from The Diamond Sutra -- not only in those moments. You are all the time enlightened. From the very beginning to the very end, you remain enlightened. You can go on deceiving yourself that you are not enlightened as long as you want, but all the same you are enlightened.\nIt is like a man who is pretending to be a woman in a drama. He is all the time a\nman. He can go on pretending, sometimes even he may forget. If he is a good actor, a really good actor, he may get into the idea and forget about it. For a few moments he may think that he is a woman, but again and again he will know that he is a man.\nIt is a miracle that you forget that you are enlightened, that you go on forgetting it, but you ARE enlightened. Remember, enlightenment is not a quality that is going to happen to you in some future. You have brought it from the very beginning. It is in your breathing, it is in your heartbeat. It is the stuff you are made of.\n\"At those times am I enlightened?\" No, if you think that sometimes you are enlightened and sometimes not, then you are not enlightened. The day you know, the moment you know you are always enlightened, then you are enlightened. Once you have felt enlightenment, it is always there surrounding you like an aroma.\nStill you can go on playing a thousand and one games. I am playing, Buddha is playing, but that doesn't make any difference. Then it is with full awareness that the game is played. It does not entangle, it does not imprison.\nOnce you play a game knowing that it is a game, then there is no problem. Then you can be in the world, then you can be whatsoever you enjoy to be, but deep down you know you are not that. Deep down you remain far away. You become a lotus flower -- in the water and yet the water touches you not.\n\"At those times am I enlightened?\" you ask. \"Please comment on how this obviously superficial knowing can penetrate and become beingness.\"\nSuperficial knowing can never become beingness. Even deep and profound knowing can never become beingness. Knowledge itself is the obstacle. Knowing can never become being -- superficial or profound. Don't make these distinctions. These are tricks of the mind again. It is the knowledgeable mind.\nThe knowledgeable mind can say to you, \"It is right, superficial knowledge cannot give you enlightenment, but what about profound knowledge?\" This is again a trick played upon you. Profound? Then certainly you are caught again in the same net. Profound or not profound, knowledge as such is superficial. The profoundest knowledge is superficial, to know is superficial. To be is to be in that profoundness you are talking about.\nYou will have to be aware. Mind is very cunning. It can accept many things and again bring them back from the back door. It can say, \"Right, I perfectly agree with you. How can superficial knowledge give you enlightenment? That is not possible. I will show you the way how to get profound knowledge.\"\nWhat will you do to get profound knowledge? It will be superficial knowledge again because knowledge is superficial. At the most you will have more superficial knowledge, the quantity will grow, and through the quantity you will have the illusion that you are becoming profound.\nYou may go into deeper details, but details don't lead you to depth. You can know one thing about one thing or a thousand things about that one thing; it makes no difference --\nknowledge is about and about. It never hits the point, it never reaches the target.\nThe target is reached only by being, and to be, knowledge has to be dropped absolutely, totally, with no conditions, with no choice that \"This is good, keep it, and that is bad, drop it. This is profound, keep it, and that is not profound, drop it.\" If you keep anything of knowledge, you will remain unenlightened. And the wonder of wonders is that you are enlightened and you go on remaining unenlightened.\nThe question is from Chipper Roth. He must be a newcomer to this place, he must be an outsider. Be here. We will take away your knowledge slowly slowly. My whole work consists of making people ignorant. Ignorance has depth, ignorance has innocence, ignorance is profound -- not knowing has no limits to it. Knowing is always limited. How can it be profound? Howsoever great your knowledge, it will have a limit, a boundary to it. Only ignorance has no boundary.\nThey say that science is an effort to know more about less and less. If you go on and on with this approach -- to know more and more about less and less -- what will be the end?\nThe end will be that you know all about nothing. That will be the logical conclusion.\nI would like to say that religion is just the opposite approach: to know less and less about more and more. And what will be the ultimate result? One day... you\ngo on knowing less and less about more and more; one day you know nothing about all. And that is the experience -- to know nothing about all. That's what I call ignorance.\nRoth, please be here a little longer, hang around. The fourth question:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nQuestion 4\nI AM ENJOYING THE PLAY VERY MUCH THESE DAYS. A VERY MASTERFUL\nPERFORMANCE THIS MORNING. EVERY MORNING I WAIT EAGERLY\nWONDERING WHAT THE CURTAIN'S RISE WILL BRING. I OVERFLOW WITH\nYOU BUT IT BRINGS LAUGHTER, NOT TEARS. WHERE ARE THE TEARS?\nSucheta, they are in your laughter.\nLaughter and tears are not different. There are two types of people, the tear people and the laughter people. There are always two kinds everywhere, the whole existence is divided into duality -- man and woman, yin and yang, positive/negative, day/night, life/death. So there is this division, the laughter people and the tear people.\nThe tear people are introverts, they are easily ingoing. And when you go in, the deeper you go in the more and more your eyes will be filled with tears. Sucheta is an extrovert, she is a laughing Buddha. Geet Govind is a tearful Buddha. She is an extrovert, outgoing, a real American. So when something overwhelms her she will laugh.\nAnd remember always, never imitate anybody. If Geet Govind tries to imitate Sucheta he will be in difficulty. His laughter will be very poor and it will look phony. If Sucheta tries to imitate Geet Govind it will be very difficult to bring\ntears, and even if she can manage with some artificial aid they will not be true, they will be false.\nExtroverts should follow their way. In their life, laughter will be their overflowing energy. Love will be easier for them, meditation will be a little difficult. For the introverts, meditation will be easier, love will be a little difficult; tears will be easier, laughter will be a little difficult.\nNever imitate anybody, just go on your own way, and by and by you will see a transformation coming when you have touched the extreme. For example, if you go on laughing... for example, if Sucheta goes on laughing to the utter extreme, tears will come.\nThere will come a moment in laughter when the laughter will start disappearing and tears will come. If Geet Govind goes on crying and crying and crying in tears and tears and tears to the very end, suddenly he will find a change happening: laughter will arise. The revolution is only from the extreme.\nOnce I was talking to a council of Buddhists. Now to say to Buddhists that the revolution is from the extreme, or that truth is only at the extreme, is very difficult because they believe in the middle way, the golden mean. Buddha's path is known as MAJJHIMA NIKAYA, the middle way.\nI forgot that they were Buddhists. I talked about the extreme and I told them that the revolution happens only from the extreme, from the utter extreme. Unless you reach to the utter extreme there is no truth. Truth is at the extreme, this or that -- but at the extreme. Either love at the extreme or meditation at the extreme.\nThey were patient -- Buddhists are patient; they are not like Mohammedans, they will not start fighting -- but still, patience has a boundary. One Buddhist could not tolerate, it although Buddha has said to tolerate. He stood up. He said, \"This is too much. Have you forgotten completely that Buddha's path is known as the middle path?\"\nThen I remembered and I said, \"True, I know, but unless you are at the extreme middle there is no truth.\" I was talking about the extreme, it had nothing to do with the middle.\n\"If you are at the extreme middle, exactly the middle, then again truth. Truth happens only with the extreme.\"\nFrom the extreme the pendulum swings towards the other polarity. So, good Sucheta.\nLaugh, laugh to the extreme. One day you will see your laughter is bringing beautiful tears.\nThe sixth question:\nQuestion 5 OSHO,\nCANNOT ONE DECLARE THAT ONE HAS EXPERIENCED GOD?\nIf you have experienced, your very existence will be the declaration, you need not declare. At least you need not ask. If the declaration comes it comes, what can you do?\nOne who has experienced God will not decide anything, not even this -- whether he has to declare or not. One who has experienced God has dropped the mind. Now whatsoever happens he will be into it, he will be totally into it. If declaration comes it comes.\nIt came to Mansoor. He declared, \"ANA'L-HAQ, I am God.\" His master, Junnaid, told him, \"Mansoor, this is not right. You will get into trouble. I also know but I have never declared because you know these Mohammedans who are all around -- they will kill you.\"\nBut Mansoor said, \"What can I do? When he declares what can I do? Suddenly he catches hold of me and declares.\"\nJunnaid was so afraid that he expelled Mansoor from his school. He said, \"You go away, go somewhere else. You will get into trouble, and you will also get me into trouble.\"\nBut Mansoor said, \"What can I do? If he wants to get into trouble himself, what can I do?\" And he got into trouble. But it was true that he could not do anything. He declared at the last moment also from the cross: \"ANA'L-HAQ, I am God\" -- and laughed.\nSomebody asked from the crowd, \"If you can still deny, if you can still say that you were wrong in declaring yourself God, there is still hope that you can be forgiven.\"\nHe laughed and he said, \"But what can I do? He declares.\"\nAnd you are asking me: \"Cannot one declare that one has experienced God?\" If God declares, good. If God is not declaring, you please keep quiet, leave it to him.\nJ. Donald Walters writes:\nA few years ago I met a man who was holding forth, somewhat drunkenly, and with massive self-importance, on his version of how the universe ought to be run. I forget how it came about, but I happened to mention that I thought I had met perhaps six people in my life who knew God. My companion held out a huge, hairy paw. \"Shake!\" he cried hoarsely. \"Ya just met the seventh.\"\nDonald Walters writes that he could not believe that this man had experienced God, because he thinks how, if you have experienced God, will you declare so blatantly,\n\"Shake! Ya just met the seventh.\"\nBut that it not my opinion. It is possible. Because sometimes God is hoarse, sometimes very polite and sometimes very hoarse. God comes in all shapes and sizes. Sometimes his hands are very very smooth and sometimes very hairy. He comes in all the ways. His ways are mysterious.\nSo if he wants to declare through you, go to the housetops and let him declare. But if he does not want to declare and you declare on your own, you will get into trouble. If he wants to get into trouble that is his business, but don't decide on your own otherwise it will be just an ego trip.\nReading this story of Donald Walters, I felt very much for the man who said, \"Shake! Ya just met the seventh.\"\nWalters writes condemningly. He thinks this is not the way. Who will decide what is the way? No one should decide. Who am I to tell you that you should not declare? If he wants to declare, who am I to tell you? Let his will be done.\nBut remember always, it should not be your decision. If you decide to declare, that simply means you have not known. Then the mind is playing the greatest megalomaniac trick. Then the mind is going mad.\nThe seventh question:\nQuestion 6 OSHO,\nA DEAR FRIEND OF MINE SENT A LETTER TO YOU FROM THE WEST ASKING\nFOR A SANNYAS NAME AND THEN CAME HERE BEFORE SHE RECEIVED AN\nANSWER AND TOOK SANNYAS HERE. THE NAME SHE WAS GIVEN BY\nLETTER WAS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT KIND OF NAME FROM THE ONE YOU\nGAVE HER HERE. I WAS VERY DISTURBED WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THIS\nBECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF MY NAME AS MY PATH. I HAVE\nUSED IT TO DIRECT ME WHEN I HAVE BEEN CONFUSED. WHAT REALLY IS\nTHE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NAME YOU GIVE TO US.\nVeera, all holy cow dung. Don't be deceived by the names. You are always hankering to catch hold of something, to make something big out of nothings. The names I give you are just like lovers' sweet nothings. Don't make much fuss about them.\nIn fact, once I have given you the name, never come and ask me about its meaning again because I forget. It is in that moment that I create the meaning around it. Then how am I supposed to remember? I must have given thirty\nthousand names or more.\nA name is just a name. You are nameless. No name confines you, no name can confine you. They are just labels to be used -- utilitarian, nothing spiritual in it. But because I pay so much attention to your name and I explain it to you, you get hooked with it. That is just my way of showering my attention on you, nothing else; just my way of showing my love to you, nothing else.\nBELOVED OSHO,\nQuestion 7\nWHY DO I ALWAYS FALL ASLEEP IN DISCOURSE? SOMETIMES I CAN'T HELP\nCOMPARING MYSELF TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO SIT ABSOLUTELY STILL, JUST IMBIBING YOU, AND THAT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I HAVE SO FAR TO\nGO, ESPECIALLY EVERY TIME WHEN PEOPLE COME UP TO ME AFTER THE\nLECTURE AND SAY, \"WASN'T IT AMAZING TODAY?\"\nMAYBE MORE WOULD COME THROUGH TO ME IF I JUST ACCEPT THAT\nDISCOURSE IS A GOOD PLACE FOR ME TO SLEEP.\nIt is the perfect place. Don't be worried about those people who come and tell you, they must be joking. You sleep well. They must be trying to disturb you, they must be trying to create some jealousy in you. They must be really jealous of you -- that you are sleeping so well and snoring, and those poor people are just sitting. They want to disturb you.\nDon't be worried. Go on sleeping. You have to go far, but in sleep, nowhere else.\nThe game was drifting off into total boredom when a man in the crowd suddenly burst into a round of applause. The man next to him said, \"Why did you do that?\"\n\"Sorry,\" he replied. \"I was trying to keep myself awake.\"\nYou don't know how much difficulty people are having in keeping themselves awake.\nYou just go into your sleep, relax into it. If you can accept it totally, that will become a great experience.\nThe mind always creates conflict. If you don't sleep, the mind says, \"I am feeling like it would be good if I could sleep.\" If you sleep, the mind says, \"You have missed something, you should not do this.\" The mind always creates conflict, friction. It is never happy with anything. Drop that mind. If sleep comes naturally, then allow it. In that very acceptance and the disappearance of the mind, you will be hearing The Diamond Sutra.\nPatanjali says sleep is just next to samadhi. A good sleep, a deep sleep, and samadhi, are different only in one sense: samadhi has awareness, sleep has no awareness. But awareness can happen in sleep. Don't make trouble for yourself, don't divide yourself.\nIf sleep is not coming, perfectly good, keep awake, but then it will not be an effort. If sleep is coming then fall asleep, then don't try to keep yourself awake. And I am not saying that if sleep is not coming you have to try to go to sleep. Accept whatsoever is the case. Accept reality as it happens in a certain moment. Be totally in the moment.\nThat's my whole message, to be utterly with the moment. This is desire: \"I should not be asleep.\" Why? This is not spiritual -- to sit in a discourse and fall asleep. Why? Sleep is a perfectly spiritual activity, a great spiritual activity. It is as good as sitting there and thinking, dreaming is as good. Dreaming is just a primitive form of thinking, more colorful. Others are thinking, you are dreaming. What is the difference? Dream well, sleep well, relax.\nOne day, out of this relaxation you will start becoming aware and alert, but that alertness will have a different quality to it. It will not be forced, it will not be manipulated by you, it will come. One day suddenly in the middle of the discourse you will open your eyes, fresh, young, from the deep sleep, and something, just a word, may go into your being and will transform you.\nThe whole Diamond Sutra was not needed when Hui Neng heard four lines --\nthat was enough. Sometimes a single word from a Buddha is enough. It just goes like an arrow and pierces your heart and you are no longer the same.\nSo don't be worried. Relax well. And if you have relaxed well and you open your eyes, some time it is possible -- there may happen the meeting between you and me. And you will be so fresh from sleep, unthinking, not knowing who you are.…\nDon't you know? Sometimes it happens in the morning when you wake, it takes a few seconds for you to recognize who you are, the mind takes time to come back. Sometimes you cannot even recognize where you are. Suddenly awakened in the middle of the night, everybody will wonder who he is, where he is. He will take a little time to gather himself together.\nSo it is possible, sleeping, one day in the middle you hear my shouting. Suddenly you wake up and you don't know where you are. That is the right moment I can enter in you.\nSo don't be worried. Whatsoever happens is good. All is accepted here. I accept you as you are. I have no 'shoulds' for you.\nThe last question:\nQuestion 8 OSHO,\nWHY CAN'T PEOPLE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER'S RELIGIONS? WHY IS THERE ALWAYS SO MUCH CONFLICT?\nThe ego. It has nothing to do with religions, just the ego. Whatsoever is yours has to be the best in the world. Whatsoever is others' cannot be the best, cannot be allowed to be the best in the world.\nYour wife is the most beautiful woman, your husband is the most beautiful person. You are the greatest man in the world. You may not say so, but you say it in a thousand and one ways. And whatsoever belongs to you has to be the best. People are just like small children. Small children go on fighting, \"My daddy can lick your daddy any time.\"\nA small boy was telling another boy, \"My mother is a great orator. She can speak on any subject for hours.\"\nThe other said, \"That's nothing. My mother is such a great orator she can speak without any subject for hours. Nobody knows what she is speaking.\"\nPeople go on bragging about their things, about everything, about religion too.\nMulla Nasruddin's son asked him, \"Pop, if a Mohammedan leaves his religion and becomes a Hindu or a Christian, what would you call him?\"\nThe Mulla became very angry and he said, \"He is a traitor! He should be shot. This is the greatest sin in the world -- to change your religion, to betray your religion. He is NAMAK HARAM -- he has betrayed his salt.\"\nThen the boy asked, \"Then Pop, if a Hindu or a Christian becomes a Mohammedan?\"\nMulla was all smiles, Jimmy Carter smiles. He said, \"That is great. That man is wise.\nThat man should be welcomed and respected and honored. He knows what is truth and he is courageous. He is a convert, my son!\"\nNow the thing has changed. If a Mohammedan becomes a Hindu or a Christian he is a traitor; if a Hindu or a Christian becomes a Mohammedan he is a convert and he is a great man and he should be honored and respected. He is wise because he has recognized what is the real religion.\nThat's how our egos function. That's why religions, rather than bringing peace to the world, have been the cause of bloody wars. Many more people have been killed in the name of religion than in any other name. Not even politicians have been able to surpass the so-called religious people in murder. The greatest murderers have been the churches and the mosques and the temples.\nIn the future this ugliness has to be dropped; it should be immediately dropped. A religion is a personal choice. If somebody does not like the roseflower, you don't kill him and you don't say that he is ugly, you don't say that he is wrong. You say that that is his liking. He does not like the roseflower, it is finished. I like the roseflower. But it is a question of liking. There is no question of truth in\nit, there is no question of arguing about it and there is no reason to prove why I don't like the rose. If I don't like, I don't like. If you like, you like. There is no conflict. Religion should be like that.\nSomebody likes Jesus -- perfectly beautiful. Somebody likes Buddha, somebody likes Krishna -- likings. A religion should not have anything to do with birth. It should be a pure liking. Then there will be no conflict, then there will be no unnecessary arguing which goes on and on down the centuries. Rather than praying, people have been arguing.\nThe whole energy that they have put to argument, if it would have been put into prayer they would have known what God is. But they go on arguing, great debates continue, and nothing is ever proved because nothing can ever be proved.\nIf you like Jesus, it is just like when you fall in love with a woman. You cannot prove anything. Why? ... And whatsoever you prove will look foolish to others. If you say to others, \"Look at her nose -- how long, how beautiful,\" people will say \"That looks ugly, it is out of shape, it is too big, the face is not in proportion.\" If you say, \"Look at the eyes --\nso big, so beautiful,\" then somebody will say, \"They look frightening. I cannot stay with that woman in the night. Those two big eyes... I am scared. And they are too big and not symmetrical!\"\nThere is no way to prove your liking. Somebody likes Jesus and somebody likes Buddha.\nThis is falling in love -- you need not prove it. And if you prove it you will look a fool to others. That's how it looks. Hindus think people who are in love with Jesus are foolish: What is there in this man? You ask the Hindus? -- they have a beautiful theory of karma.\nThey say you suffer only if you have done wrong in your past lives. Why was Jesus crucified? He must have done great sins; otherwise why? Krishna is not crucified, Rama is not crucified -- why is Jesus crucified? He must have been a sinner.\nNow the whole perspective changes. Now you ask a Christian about Krishna playing upon the flute. It looks so beautiful and Jesus on the cross looks so sad,\nand he will say,\n\"What are you talking about? This world is in such misery, this man Krishna must have been of a very stony heart. He is playing on the flute and people are dying and people are in misery and there is death and disease and this man is playing on the flute. He must have a very very rocklike heart. He has no heart. If he had any heart he would have sacrificed himself for the downtrodden, for the oppressed, for those who are in misery.\nLook at Jesus -- he is the savior. He died for us so that we can be redeemed. This Krishna looks shallow.\"\nBut ask the Hindu who follows Krishna. He will say, \"What are you talking about? There is no misery. All misery is illusion. And if people are suffering they are suffering for their sins. Nobody else can redeem them. And the only redeemer that can be of any help is one who brings joy into the world. Only joy is the healing force. How can you redeem?\"\nHindus say if somebody is crying and you sit by the side and you also cry, can you redeem him? Crying is doubled. Somebody is ill and you fall in sympathy and lie down by their side -- how are you helping? To help you have to be healthy. You need not fall ill. Krishna is healthy, Krishna is joy. The world is so in misery, that's why he brings his flute. Crosses everybody is carrying already -- what is there in carrying a cross?\nEverybody is carrying a cross. A flute is needed. Now these are the ways and everybody can go on arguing for and against.\nTo me, religion is a love affair. It has nothing to do with intellect, it has nothing to do with reason. It is falling in love. With whomsoever you have fallen in love, that is your way. Go through it -- that is your door.\nLove is the door, it is irrelevant with whom you have fallen in love. Love redeems, neither Jesus, nor Krishna. Love redeems. Fall in love. Love is the only redeeming force.\nLove is the savior. But your egos.… Meditate over this beautiful story:\nPatrick the First, the Irish pope, was sitting in his office in the Vatican one day, reading the CATHOLIC HERALD, when a small article in the Irish section entitled \"Record Births\" caught his attention.\n\"Holy Mary Michael!\" said the pope to his secretary, Cardinal Fitz-Michael. \"Do you see this, bejaisus!\"\n\"And what is that, Monseigneur,\" said Michael, jumping up from his paperwork.\n\"It says the wife of Paddy O'Flynne from Dublin has just presented him with his fifty-sixth child,\" said the pope.\n\"The saints be praised, sir,\" said Michael. \"Some miracle indeed, is it not?\"\n\"The Lord's work, to be sure,\" cried the pope, \"and should be commemorated in some way for the unity of the Catholic church, world faith in general, and the Emerald Isle in particular.\"\n\"Indeed sir, what exactly do you have in mind?\"\n\"No mind, Michael,\" replied the pope excitedly, \"Action! Go this very moment to the workshop, have a golden madonna stuck up, top priority job, then run around to the travel agents and book me a first class return flight to Dublin on Aer Lingus. I myself personally will take the madonna as a little gift and present it to the O'Flynnes. I could do with a little holiday in the old country.\"\nThe next morning sharp, Pope Pat, clutching the madonna, the HERALD, and a bottle of Irish whiskey for the flight, boarded the plane for Dublin. On arrival he went straight to O'Flynne's home whereupon he was taken to the local pub by one of the family to where the main celebrations were taking place.\n\"Someone to see you, Dad,\" yelled the kid to the roomful of drinkers. \"Tell him to grab a Guinness and come over!\" a voice replied.\nThe pope grabbed a Guinness and pushed his way, madonna first, into the center of the high-spirited group of inebriates. Some hours and many Guinnesses later, the pope finally staggered up to Paddy and, thrusting the madonna at him slurred, \"I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to you.\"\n\"And who do I have the honor of addressing, sir?' said Paddy, beholding the drunken cleric, Guinness in one hand, madonna in the other.\n\"Well, you don't know me personally, Paddy, but in fact I am the pope.\"\n\"The pope!\" exclaimed Paddy. \"And you are in a dangerous place to be sure. Will you have another little Guinness?\"\n\"I will indeed,\" said the pope, \"if you will just promise me one thing before I do.\"\n\"For a drinking man,\" said Paddy, \"it will be hard to refuse.\"\n\"I would like you to accept this madonna as a little gift from us all at the Vatican and take it and put it on the altar of your local Catholic church.\"\n\"Ah now, sir,\" said Paddy. \"I will take the madonna, sir, to be sure, and very grateful I am, but put it on the altar of me local catholic church I cannot do.\"\n\"And why ever not,\" said the pope in amazement, \"as a gift to Mother Mary?\" \"Well, the truth is, sir,\" said Paddy, \"I am not a Catholic, I am a Protestant.\"\n\"What!\" screamed the pope. \"You mean to say I have come all this way to present me golden madonna to a fucking sex maniac!\"\nEnough for today.

title: Utter Emptiness<span id=bookmark19>‌</span></h2><p>30 December 1977 am in Buddha Hall Archive</p><p>code:</p><p>7712300</p><p>ShortTitle:</p><p>DIAMON10</p><p>Audio:</p><p>Yes Video: No Length:</p><p>83</p><p>mins</p><p>The first question:</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>Question 1</p><p>EVEN IN MY RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU, WORDS BECOME LESS IMPORTANT</p><p>ALL THE TIME. WHY SHOULD A BUDDHA AND A BODHISATTVA NEED TO</p><p>TALK AT ALL?</p><p>What are you talking about, about what talk? It never happened.
Nobody has said anything and nobody has heard anything. The Diamond
Sutra has no sutras in it, Mahasattva, that's why it is called The
Diamond Sutra. It is an utter emptiness. If you get caught in the words
you will miss the message.</p><p>The Diamond Sutra is absolutely empty, there is no message in it.
There is nothing to read and nothing to hear. It is utter silence. If
you read something in The Diamond Sutra you have missed it. If you find
some doctrine in it, some philosophy in it, then you must be imagining,
it must be your dream. Buddha has not talked anything, neither has
Subhuti heard anything.</p><p>In that non-talking and non-hearing, something has happened --
something which is beyond words. Ananda has tried to capture that for
you in words, but it was not delivered in words. It was a communion
between two emptinesses.</p><p>You just go to the sea and you see the morning, and the fresh air and
the sunrays and the waves, and you come home and you relate to somebody
what you have seen. Then you relate only words. The word sea is not the
sea and the word sun is not the sun and the word freshness is not
freshness. How do you commune? You have come back from the beach and
your beloved asks, "What happened?" You bring all that has happened into
words, knowing perfectly well that it cannot be brought into words, it
cannot be reduced into words. Words are so pale.</p><p>Something has certainly happened between Buddha and Subhuti,
something which is transcendental. Maybe they had just looked into each
other's eyes. Something was triggered in the consciousness of Subhuti by
Buddha's presence. Ananda is trying to report it for you. You are blind.
You cannot see light, you can only hear the word light.</p><p>So remember: The Diamond Sutra is not a sutra at all, that's why it
is called The Diamond Sutra, the most precious, because it contains no
philosophy, no system, no theory. It contains no words, it is an empty
book.</p><p>If you can forget the words and you can go deeper into the gaps
between the words, if you can forget the lines and can go deeper between
the lines, in the intervals, in the pauses, then you will find what has
happened. It is not a verbal communication.</p><p>I am also talking to you, but still I would like to remind you to
remember that my message is not in my words. You will have to step upon
the words to get it.</p><p>Use the words as a staircase, as stepping stones. Remember, stepping
stones can become hindrances if you don't know how to step over
them.</p><p>You have to listen in silence to silence.</p><p>Mahasattva, Buddha has not said a single word, neither has Subhuti
heard a single word.</p><p>It is the compassion of Ananda to make a few maps for you. Those maps
are not the countries. If you have a map of India, that map is not
India, it cannot be. How can it be?</p><p>But it can be of some limited help to you; it can lead you to the
real India. It is like the arrow on the milestone by the side of the
road, it points towards something.</p><p>This whole Diamond Sutra points towards silence. Hence so many
contradictions in it, because only through contradictions can silence be
created. Each word has to be contradicted by its opposite immediately it
is uttered so that they destroy each other and in the wake, silence is
felt.</p><p>The second question:</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>Question 2</p><p>THE DEEPER INTO MYSELF, THE MORE ALONE I FEEL. THERE IS ONLY</p><p>NOTHINGNESS. AND SOMETIMES, LOOKING INTO YOUR EYES, I GET THE</p><p>SAME FEELING OF A VAST EMPTINESS.</p><p>IF IT IS NATURAL -- IF BEING ALONE IS BASIC, THE VERY ESSENCE OF
MY</p><p>BEING -- THEN HOW COULD THE ILLUSIVE IDEA OF BECOMING ONE, OF</p><p>FALLING IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY ETERNALLY, COME INTO BEING IN</p><p>THE FIRST PLACE? AND WHY IS IT SO PAINFUL TO BECOME AWARE THAT</p><p>IT IS AN ILLUSION? PLEASE CLEAR MY DOUBTS.</p><p>You are the doubter and you are the doubt. There is no other doubt.
First, when you say,</p><p>"The deeper I fall into myself, the more alone I feel," if you have
really been falling deeper you will feel aloneness but you will not feel
"I am alone," because then there are two things, I and aloneness. Then
you are not alone. Then there is the experiencer and the experienced,
the observer and the observed. Then you are not alone; the other is
there --</p><p>the experience is the other.</p><p>When you really fall deep into yourself, you will not find yourself;
that is the whole thing to understand. It is only on the surface that
the waves exist. If you go deeper into the ocean you will not find
waves, or can you? How can you find waves in the depth? They exist only
on the surface, they can exist only on the surface. They need winds to
exist.</p><p>The 'I' can exist only on the surface because it needs thou, the wind
of the thou to exist.</p><p>When you go deeper into yourself the winds are no longer there, thous
are no longer there. How can there be 'I'? I and thou exist in a pair,
they are never divorced. Yes, you will find aloneness, but not I-ness.
And aloneness is beautiful. Let me remind you again, the word alone
means all one. That's how it is constructed -- all one. On the surface
you are separate from all. In fact on the surface you are lonely because
you are separate from the all. In the depth, when you have disappeared,
there is no distinction between you and all. All is one, you are no
longer, aloneness is.</p><p>You say, "The deeper I fall into myself the more alone I feel." You
must be imagining that you are falling deeper into yourself. The mind
can go on playing games. It can play the game of being alone, it can
play the game of being in</p><p>prayer, it can play the game of being in meditation, but if 'I'
remains then you can be certain it is a game, nothing real has happened.
That's why again the desire for the other will arise.</p><p>The 'I' cannot exist alone. It needs the other to support it, to feed
it, to nourish it. It will bring you back to the other. That's why when
you are lonely you start thinking of your beloved, of your friend, of
your mother, father, this and that, a thousand and one things.</p><p>You create imaginary 'thous'. If a man is put in isolation for more
than three weeks he starts talking to himself. He creates the whole
dialogue. He himself is divided in two -- I and thou. He becomes two so
the game call be played. 'I' cannot exist separate from</p><p>'thou'.</p><p>"The deeper I fall into myself, the more alone I feel."</p><p>No, you must be feeling lonely. Never use these two words as
synonymous. Loneliness is negative, aloneness is positive. Loneliness
simply means you are missing the other. The other is absent, there is a
gap in you. Aloneness means you are present, there is no gap in you. You
are full of presence, you are utterly there. Loneliness is the absence
of the other, aloneness is the presence of your eternal being.</p><p>You say "there is only nothingness." No, if there is only nothingness
then there is no problem. If there is only nothingness and nobody to
know it, nobody to feel it, then there is no problem. Then from where
comes the doubt? How can the doubter arise? No, you are there. That
nothingness is bogus because you are there. How can it be nothingness?
It is just your idea.</p><p>This used to happen in my family when I was a child. I was so lazy --
I am still -</p><p>- I was so lazy, utterly lazy, that my family lost all hope with me.
By and by they started forgetting about me, because I would never do
anything. I would sit in the corner and just sit, either with closed
eyes or with open eyes, but I was so absent to them that by and by they
became oblivious to me.</p><p>Sometimes it would happen that my mother would need something from
the market, vegetables or something, and I would be sitting in front of
her and she would say,</p><p>"Nobody seems to be present here." She was just sitting in front of
me and talking to me,</p><p>"Nobody seems to be here. I want somebody to go and fetch vegetables
from the market."</p><p>And I was sitting in front of her and she said, "Nobody is here."</p><p>I was counted as nobody. Even if a stray dog would enter in the house
I would allow it. I was sitting at the gate and the dog would enter and
I would watch. And my mother would come rushing out and she would say,
"nobody is here to prevent this dog" -- and I was sitting there!</p><p>By and by they had accepted that I was as if not. But that does not
make much difference; I was there. I had seen the dog coming, I was
hearing their words. I knew I could manage to go to the market-place and
fetch vegetables for her. And I would laugh at the whole idea -- that
she went on saying that nobody was there.</p><p>That's what is happening to you. You are there, and you say
nothingness is. You are oblivious of yourself, you don't take note of
yourself, otherwise you are there. If you are not there, who is saying
that nothingness is? Then there is nothingness when you are not there,
then there is pure nothingness. In that purity is nirvana,
enlightenment. That is the most valuable place to be, the most spacious
place to be. It is the space everybody is searching for, because it is
unlimited, infinite. And its purity is absolute. It is not polluted by
anything; even you are not there. There is light and there is
consciousness, but there is no 'I'. 'I' is like ice, frozen
consciousness. Consciousness is like melted ice, liquid, or, even
better, even the water has evaporated, has become invisible.</p><p>And you say: "And why is it so painful to become aware that it is an
illusion?" -- the other. It is painful because the I starts dying. To
recognize the other as the illusion, to recognize love as illusion, is
very hard, because then the I starts dying. If you drop the you, the I
cannot exist. And you don't know the beauty of dropping the I.</p><p>And you ask: "If it is natural -- if being alone is basic, the very
essence of my being --</p><p>then how could the illusive idea of becoming one, of falling in love
with somebody eternally, come into being in the first place?"</p><p>It came only because of that -- because aloneness is basic,
essential. The Hindu scriptures say that God was alone. Just think, just
visualize God alone and alone and alone for eternity. He became fed up
with his aloneness, it was monotonous. He wanted to have a little play.
He created the other and started playing hide- and-seek.</p><p>When you are tired of the play, when you become fed up with the play,
you become a Buddha again. You again drop your toys. They are created by
you, the value is imagined by you; you have put the value on them. The
moment you withdraw your value they disappear, you are again alone.</p><p>The Hindu concept is tremendously valuable, significant. It says God
was alone, it became monotonous, and he created the world, the other,
just to have a little chitchat with the other, to have a little
dialogue. Then again and again one comes and feels tired and bored with
the other, disappears into oneself, again reaches to one's nothingness
and becomes a god.</p><p>You are all gods who are deceiving themselves. It is your choice. The
day you choose not to be this way you will be free. It is your dream.
Because of aloneness, because aloneness is the essential quality of your
being, the other has been created.</p><p>You just try it, go for a few weeks to the mountains and sit alone
and you will feel very good. Everybody is tired of relationship and fed
up and bored. Go to the mountains and sit silently and you will feel so
beautiful, but after three or four days, five days, seven days, three
weeks, you will start thinking of the other. Your woman again starts
being attractive to you. You forget all the nastiness and all the
nagging. You forget all that she has been doing to you, you completely
forget all. She is again beautiful, she is again lovely, she is again
fantastic, mm? -</p><p>- you put value again.</p><p>Then you have to come down from the mountains to the plains, and for
two or three days with the woman things are going beautifully -- a new
honeymoon and after two or three days things become difficult again, and
again you start thinking how to meditate, how to be silent. This is how
you go on. Just watch your consciousness and its fluctuations and
through it you will know the whole process of existence, because you are
a miniature existence.</p><p>The pendulum of consciousness goes on swinging between meditation and
love,</p><p>between aloneness and togetherness. And because all the religions of
the world up to now have been either of love or of meditation, they were
fragmentary, they were not total. I am giving you the total religion. I
am not choosing.</p><p>For example, Buddha had chosen meditation. He gives you the love for
meditation, no other love. He teaches you only to be alone, absolutely
alone and nothing else. It is good, it is tremendously good for people
who are tired and fed up with the world.</p><p>He was tired and fed up with the world. He was a king, he was not a
beggar. He was tired of women. His father had brought all the beautiful
girls from the kingdom for him. He had one of the most beautiful harems.
If you get all the beautiful women of the world in your house, how long
will you be able to live there? Just think of it: one is more than
enough. Now all the beautiful women of the kingdom were there. It must
have been maddening. If he escaped, it is no wonder. All the pleasures
were arranged for him, every kind of pleasure was arranged for him. If
he became fed up, it is no wonder. He moved to the other pole. The other
was too much. He escaped into the jungle, he became alone.</p><p>There are religions which are religions of meditation -- Buddhism,
Jainism. There are religions which are religions of love --
Christianity, Mohammedanism. And this has to be understood. Jesus is a
poor man, so is Mohammed. This can't be accidental. Mahavira is a king,
so is Buddha. The two kings have given to the world the religion of
meditation, and the two poor people of the world have given the religion
of love.</p><p>The poor cannot be fed up with the other. The poor has not had that
much of the other.</p><p>The poor hankers for the other. The other may be the woman or money
or power or prestige or God; it makes no difference -- the other is
needed.</p><p>Christianity and Islam are both religions of prayer, love -- love for
God, prayer for God.</p><p>In Buddhism, in Jainism, there is no place for God at all because
there is no place for the other. Aloneness is enough. In Jainism and in
Buddhism there is no existence of anything like prayer, the word has not
been heard; they know only of meditation. Christianity knows nothing of
meditation. These are not accidental things, they show something about
the founders.</p><p>I am giving you a total religion, a religion which allows both. When
you are feeling tired with the other, move into meditation, swing into
meditation. When you are feeling tired of aloneness, swing into love.
Both are good. Both are contradictory, but through contradiction great
joy arises. If you have only one you will not have that kind of
richness. The one can give you silence or can give you great joy, but
both can give you something infinitely precious, incomparable. Both
together, they can give you a silent ecstasy, a peaceful joy. At the
innermost core you remain utterly silent, and on the periphery, the
dance. And when silence dances or silence sings, that is the richest,
the peakest of peaks. Hence my insistence for both.</p><p>George Bernard Shaw once at a party was sitting alone at the edge of
the room. His hostess came over to him and inquired solicitously,
"Aren't you enjoying yourself?"</p><p>Shaw replied, "That's all I am enjoying."</p><p>He has hit upon a great truth, a great insight is there: one's self
is all anyone can enjoy.</p><p>Life starts taking the quality of silence. But if you can enjoy only
yourself and never the other then you will miss the other dimension. One
should be capable of enjoying oneself and the other too. That's what I
call the whole man, the holy man.</p><p>The third question:</p><p>Question 3 OSHO,</p><p>WHEN I HEAR YOUR DISCOURSES AND AT OTHER TIMES, I KNOW THAT I KNOW
ALL THAT IS NEEDED TO BE ENLIGHTENED. AT THOSE TIMES AM I ENLIGHTENED?
PLEASE COMMENT ON HOW THIS OBVIOUSLY</p><p>SUPERFICIAL 'KNOWING' CAN PENETRATE AND BECOME BEINGNESS. IT</p><p>SEEMS THAT THIS KNOWING IS ROBBING ME OF INNOCENCE AND</p><p>MORE</p><p>COMPLETE EXPERIENTIAL REALIZATION, THAT KNOWLEDGE HAS FAR</p><p>OUTSPACED THE GROWTH OF MY BEING, AND YET, KNOWING THERE IS NO</p><p>SUCH THING AS MY BEING, I DON'T FEEL WHOLLY MOTIVATED TOWARDS</p><p>GROWING ONE.</p><p>The first thing, you say: "When I hear your discourses and at other
times I know that I know all that is needed to be enlightened."</p><p>Nothing is needed to be enlightened, so how can you know all that is
needed to be enlightened? Nothing is needed to be enlightened.
Enlightenment is your natural state; it is not something that has to he
produced, manufactured, created. If you are manufacturing something new,
then many things will be needed. If you are not manufacturing anything
new, what is needed? You are enlightened. How can anything be needed?
Nothing is needed.</p><p>So your idea that you think "I know that I know all that is needed to
be enlightened" is barring your way. Nothing is needed to be enlightened
and nothing is needed to be known to be enlightened. Enlightenment is
already there, is already the case. It is not a realization, it is only
a recognition. It is not that you have to make efforts to bring it; all
that you need is not to make any effort. Drop all efforts -- and
suddenly it is there. You cannot see it because you are continuously
making efforts to see it. Your very effort to see it is functioning as a
barrier.</p><p>And you say: "At those times am I enlightened?" You are enlightened
all the time, not when you hear me, not when you read something from The
Diamond Sutra -- not only in those moments. You are all the time
enlightened. From the very beginning to the very end, you remain
enlightened. You can go on deceiving yourself that you are not
enlightened as long as you want, but all the same you are
enlightened.</p><p>It is like a man who is pretending to be a woman in a drama. He is
all the time a</p><p>man. He can go on pretending, sometimes even he may forget. If he is
a good actor, a really good actor, he may get into the idea and forget
about it. For a few moments he may think that he is a woman, but again
and again he will know that he is a man.</p><p>It is a miracle that you forget that you are enlightened, that you go
on forgetting it, but you ARE enlightened. Remember, enlightenment is
not a quality that is going to happen to you in some future. You have
brought it from the very beginning. It is in your breathing, it is in
your heartbeat. It is the stuff you are made of.</p><p>"At those times am I enlightened?" No, if you think that sometimes
you are enlightened and sometimes not, then you are not enlightened. The
day you know, the moment you know you are always enlightened, then you
are enlightened. Once you have felt enlightenment, it is always there
surrounding you like an aroma.</p><p>Still you can go on playing a thousand and one games. I am playing,
Buddha is playing, but that doesn't make any difference. Then it is with
full awareness that the game is played. It does not entangle, it does
not imprison.</p><p>Once you play a game knowing that it is a game, then there is no
problem. Then you can be in the world, then you can be whatsoever you
enjoy to be, but deep down you know you are not that. Deep down you
remain far away. You become a lotus flower -- in the water and yet the
water touches you not.</p><p>"At those times am I enlightened?" you ask. "Please comment on how
this obviously superficial knowing can penetrate and become
beingness."</p><p>Superficial knowing can never become beingness. Even deep and
profound knowing can never become beingness. Knowledge itself is the
obstacle. Knowing can never become being -- superficial or profound.
Don't make these distinctions. These are tricks of the mind again. It is
the knowledgeable mind.</p><p>The knowledgeable mind can say to you, "It is right, superficial
knowledge cannot give you enlightenment, but what about profound
knowledge?" This is again a trick played upon you. Profound? Then
certainly you are caught again in the same net. Profound or not
profound, knowledge as such is superficial. The profoundest knowledge is
superficial, to know is superficial. To be is to be in that profoundness
you are talking about.</p><p>You will have to be aware. Mind is very cunning. It can accept many
things and again bring them back from the back door. It can say, "Right,
I perfectly agree with you. How can superficial knowledge give you
enlightenment? That is not possible. I will show you the way how to get
profound knowledge."</p><p>What will you do to get profound knowledge? It will be superficial
knowledge again because knowledge is superficial. At the most you will
have more superficial knowledge, the quantity will grow, and through the
quantity you will have the illusion that you are becoming profound.</p><p>You may go into deeper details, but details don't lead you to depth.
You can know one thing about one thing or a thousand things about that
one thing; it makes no difference --</p><p>knowledge is about and about. It never hits the point, it never
reaches the target.</p><p>The target is reached only by being, and to be, knowledge has to be
dropped absolutely, totally, with no conditions, with no choice that
"This is good, keep it, and that is bad, drop it. This is profound, keep
it, and that is not profound, drop it." If you keep anything of
knowledge, you will remain unenlightened. And the wonder of wonders is
that you are enlightened and you go on remaining unenlightened.</p><p>The question is from Chipper Roth. He must be a newcomer to this
place, he must be an outsider. Be here. We will take away your knowledge
slowly slowly. My whole work consists of making people ignorant.
Ignorance has depth, ignorance has innocence, ignorance is profound --
not knowing has no limits to it. Knowing is always limited. How can it
be profound? Howsoever great your knowledge, it will have a limit, a
boundary to it. Only ignorance has no boundary.</p><p>They say that science is an effort to know more about less and less.
If you go on and on with this approach -- to know more and more about
less and less -- what will be the end?</p><p>The end will be that you know all about nothing. That will be the
logical conclusion.</p><p>I would like to say that religion is just the opposite approach: to
know less and less about more and more. And what will be the ultimate
result? One day... you</p><p>go on knowing less and less about more and more; one day you know
nothing about all. And that is the experience -- to know nothing about
all. That's what I call ignorance.</p><p>Roth, please be here a little longer, hang around. The fourth
question:</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>Question 4</p><p>I AM ENJOYING THE PLAY VERY MUCH THESE DAYS. A VERY MASTERFUL</p><p>PERFORMANCE THIS MORNING. EVERY MORNING I WAIT EAGERLY</p><p>WONDERING WHAT THE CURTAIN'S RISE WILL BRING. I OVERFLOW WITH</p><p>YOU BUT IT BRINGS LAUGHTER, NOT TEARS. WHERE ARE THE TEARS?</p><p>Sucheta, they are in your laughter.</p><p>Laughter and tears are not different. There are two types of people,
the tear people and the laughter people. There are always two kinds
everywhere, the whole existence is divided into duality -- man and
woman, yin and yang, positive/negative, day/night, life/death. So there
is this division, the laughter people and the tear people.</p><p>The tear people are introverts, they are easily ingoing. And when you
go in, the deeper you go in the more and more your eyes will be filled
with tears. Sucheta is an extrovert, she is a laughing Buddha. Geet
Govind is a tearful Buddha. She is an extrovert, outgoing, a real
American. So when something overwhelms her she will laugh.</p><p>And remember always, never imitate anybody. If Geet Govind tries to
imitate Sucheta he will be in difficulty. His laughter will be very poor
and it will look phony. If Sucheta tries to imitate Geet Govind it will
be very difficult to bring</p><p>tears, and even if she can manage with some artificial aid they will
not be true, they will be false.</p><p>Extroverts should follow their way. In their life, laughter will be
their overflowing energy. Love will be easier for them, meditation will
be a little difficult. For the introverts, meditation will be easier,
love will be a little difficult; tears will be easier, laughter will be
a little difficult.</p><p>Never imitate anybody, just go on your own way, and by and by you
will see a transformation coming when you have touched the extreme. For
example, if you go on laughing... for example, if Sucheta goes on
laughing to the utter extreme, tears will come.</p><p>There will come a moment in laughter when the laughter will start
disappearing and tears will come. If Geet Govind goes on crying and
crying and crying in tears and tears and tears to the very end, suddenly
he will find a change happening: laughter will arise. The revolution is
only from the extreme.</p><p>Once I was talking to a council of Buddhists. Now to say to Buddhists
that the revolution is from the extreme, or that truth is only at the
extreme, is very difficult because they believe in the middle way, the
golden mean. Buddha's path is known as MAJJHIMA NIKAYA, the middle
way.</p><p>I forgot that they were Buddhists. I talked about the extreme and I
told them that the revolution happens only from the extreme, from the
utter extreme. Unless you reach to the utter extreme there is no truth.
Truth is at the extreme, this or that -- but at the extreme. Either love
at the extreme or meditation at the extreme.</p><p>They were patient -- Buddhists are patient; they are not like
Mohammedans, they will not start fighting -- but still, patience has a
boundary. One Buddhist could not tolerate, it although Buddha has said
to tolerate. He stood up. He said, "This is too much. Have you forgotten
completely that Buddha's path is known as the middle path?"</p><p>Then I remembered and I said, "True, I know, but unless you are at
the extreme middle there is no truth." I was talking about the extreme,
it had nothing to do with the middle.</p><p>"If you are at the extreme middle, exactly the middle, then again
truth. Truth happens only with the extreme."</p><p>From the extreme the pendulum swings towards the other polarity. So,
good Sucheta.</p><p>Laugh, laugh to the extreme. One day you will see your laughter is
bringing beautiful tears.</p><p>The sixth question:</p><p>Question 5 OSHO,</p><p>CANNOT ONE DECLARE THAT ONE HAS EXPERIENCED GOD?</p><p>If you have experienced, your very existence will be the declaration,
you need not declare. At least you need not ask. If the declaration
comes it comes, what can you do?</p><p>One who has experienced God will not decide anything, not even this
-- whether he has to declare or not. One who has experienced God has
dropped the mind. Now whatsoever happens he will be into it, he will be
totally into it. If declaration comes it comes.</p><p>It came to Mansoor. He declared, "ANA'L-HAQ, I am God." His master,
Junnaid, told him, "Mansoor, this is not right. You will get into
trouble. I also know but I have never declared because you know these
Mohammedans who are all around -- they will kill you."</p><p>But Mansoor said, "What can I do? When he declares what can I do?
Suddenly he catches hold of me and declares."</p><p>Junnaid was so afraid that he expelled Mansoor from his school. He
said, "You go away, go somewhere else. You will get into trouble, and
you will also get me into trouble."</p><p>But Mansoor said, "What can I do? If he wants to get into trouble
himself, what can I do?" And he got into trouble. But it was true that
he could not do anything. He declared at the last moment also from the
cross: "ANA'L-HAQ, I am God" -- and laughed.</p><p>Somebody asked from the crowd, "If you can still deny, if you can
still say that you were wrong in declaring yourself God, there is still
hope that you can be forgiven."</p><p>He laughed and he said, "But what can I do? He declares."</p><p>And you are asking me: "Cannot one declare that one has experienced
God?" If God declares, good. If God is not declaring, you please keep
quiet, leave it to him.</p><p>J. Donald Walters writes:</p><p>A few years ago I met a man who was holding forth, somewhat
drunkenly, and with massive self-importance, on his version of how the
universe ought to be run. I forget how it came about, but I happened to
mention that I thought I had met perhaps six people in my life who knew
God. My companion held out a huge, hairy paw. "Shake!" he cried
hoarsely. "Ya just met the seventh."</p><p>Donald Walters writes that he could not believe that this man had
experienced God, because he thinks how, if you have experienced God,
will you declare so blatantly,</p><p>"Shake! Ya just met the seventh."</p><p>But that it not my opinion. It is possible. Because sometimes God is
hoarse, sometimes very polite and sometimes very hoarse. God comes in
all shapes and sizes. Sometimes his hands are very very smooth and
sometimes very hairy. He comes in all the ways. His ways are
mysterious.</p><p>So if he wants to declare through you, go to the housetops and let
him declare. But if he does not want to declare and you declare on your
own, you will get into trouble. If he wants to get into trouble that is
his business, but don't decide on your own otherwise it will be just an
ego trip.</p><p>Reading this story of Donald Walters, I felt very much for the man
who said, "Shake! Ya just met the seventh."</p><p>Walters writes condemningly. He thinks this is not the way. Who will
decide what is the way? No one should decide. Who am I to tell you that
you should not declare? If he wants to declare, who am I to tell you?
Let his will be done.</p><p>But remember always, it should not be your decision. If you decide to
declare, that simply means you have not known. Then the mind is playing
the greatest megalomaniac trick. Then the mind is going mad.</p><p>The seventh question:</p><p>Question 6 OSHO,</p><p>A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE SENT A LETTER TO YOU FROM THE WEST ASKING</p><p>FOR A SANNYAS NAME AND THEN CAME HERE BEFORE SHE RECEIVED AN</p><p>ANSWER AND TOOK SANNYAS HERE. THE NAME SHE WAS GIVEN BY</p><p>LETTER WAS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT KIND OF NAME FROM THE ONE YOU</p><p>GAVE HER HERE. I WAS VERY DISTURBED WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THIS</p><p>BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF MY NAME AS MY PATH. I HAVE</p><p>USED IT TO DIRECT ME WHEN I HAVE BEEN CONFUSED. WHAT REALLY IS</p><p>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NAME YOU GIVE TO US.</p><p>Veera, all holy cow dung. Don't be deceived by the names. You are
always hankering to catch hold of something, to make something big out
of nothings. The names I give you are just like lovers' sweet nothings.
Don't make much fuss about them.</p><p>In fact, once I have given you the name, never come and ask me about
its meaning again because I forget. It is in that moment that I create
the meaning around it. Then how am I supposed to remember? I must have
given thirty</p><p>thousand names or more.</p><p>A name is just a name. You are nameless. No name confines you, no
name can confine you. They are just labels to be used -- utilitarian,
nothing spiritual in it. But because I pay so much attention to your
name and I explain it to you, you get hooked with it. That is just my
way of showering my attention on you, nothing else; just my way of
showing my love to you, nothing else.</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>Question 7</p><p>WHY DO I ALWAYS FALL ASLEEP IN DISCOURSE? SOMETIMES I CAN'T HELP</p><p>COMPARING MYSELF TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO SIT ABSOLUTELY STILL, JUST
IMBIBING YOU, AND THAT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I HAVE SO FAR TO</p><p>GO, ESPECIALLY EVERY TIME WHEN PEOPLE COME UP TO ME AFTER THE</p><p>LECTURE AND SAY, "WASN'T IT AMAZING TODAY?"</p><p>MAYBE MORE WOULD COME THROUGH TO ME IF I JUST ACCEPT THAT</p><p>DISCOURSE IS A GOOD PLACE FOR ME TO SLEEP.</p><p>It is the perfect place. Don't be worried about those people who come
and tell you, they must be joking. You sleep well. They must be trying
to disturb you, they must be trying to create some jealousy in you. They
must be really jealous of you -- that you are sleeping so well and
snoring, and those poor people are just sitting. They want to disturb
you.</p><p>Don't be worried. Go on sleeping. You have to go far, but in sleep,
nowhere else.</p><p>The game was drifting off into total boredom when a man in the crowd
suddenly burst into a round of applause. The man next to him said, "Why
did you do that?"</p><p>"Sorry," he replied. "I was trying to keep myself awake."</p><p>You don't know how much difficulty people are having in keeping
themselves awake.</p><p>You just go into your sleep, relax into it. If you can accept it
totally, that will become a great experience.</p><p>The mind always creates conflict. If you don't sleep, the mind says,
"I am feeling like it would be good if I could sleep." If you sleep, the
mind says, "You have missed something, you should not do this." The mind
always creates conflict, friction. It is never happy with anything. Drop
that mind. If sleep comes naturally, then allow it. In that very
acceptance and the disappearance of the mind, you will be hearing The
Diamond Sutra.</p><p>Patanjali says sleep is just next to samadhi. A good sleep, a deep
sleep, and samadhi, are different only in one sense: samadhi has
awareness, sleep has no awareness. But awareness can happen in sleep.
Don't make trouble for yourself, don't divide yourself.</p><p>If sleep is not coming, perfectly good, keep awake, but then it will
not be an effort. If sleep is coming then fall asleep, then don't try to
keep yourself awake. And I am not saying that if sleep is not coming you
have to try to go to sleep. Accept whatsoever is the case. Accept
reality as it happens in a certain moment. Be totally in the moment.</p><p>That's my whole message, to be utterly with the moment. This is
desire: "I should not be asleep." Why? This is not spiritual -- to sit
in a discourse and fall asleep. Why? Sleep is a perfectly spiritual
activity, a great spiritual activity. It is as good as sitting there and
thinking, dreaming is as good. Dreaming is just a primitive form of
thinking, more colorful. Others are thinking, you are dreaming. What is
the difference? Dream well, sleep well, relax.</p><p>One day, out of this relaxation you will start becoming aware and
alert, but that alertness will have a different quality to it. It will
not be forced, it will not be manipulated by you, it will come. One day
suddenly in the middle of the discourse you will open your eyes, fresh,
young, from the deep sleep, and something, just a word, may go into your
being and will transform you.</p><p>The whole Diamond Sutra was not needed when Hui Neng heard four lines
--</p><p>that was enough. Sometimes a single word from a Buddha is enough. It
just goes like an arrow and pierces your heart and you are no longer the
same.</p><p>So don't be worried. Relax well. And if you have relaxed well and you
open your eyes, some time it is possible -- there may happen the meeting
between you and me. And you will be so fresh from sleep, unthinking, not
knowing who you are.…</p><p>Don't you know? Sometimes it happens in the morning when you wake, it
takes a few seconds for you to recognize who you are, the mind takes
time to come back. Sometimes you cannot even recognize where you are.
Suddenly awakened in the middle of the night, everybody will wonder who
he is, where he is. He will take a little time to gather himself
together.</p><p>So it is possible, sleeping, one day in the middle you hear my
shouting. Suddenly you wake up and you don't know where you are. That is
the right moment I can enter in you.</p><p>So don't be worried. Whatsoever happens is good. All is accepted
here. I accept you as you are. I have no 'shoulds' for you.</p><p>The last question:</p><p>Question 8 OSHO,</p><p>WHY CAN'T PEOPLE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER'S RELIGIONS? WHY IS THERE
ALWAYS SO MUCH CONFLICT?</p><p>The ego. It has nothing to do with religions, just the ego.
Whatsoever is yours has to be the best in the world. Whatsoever is
others' cannot be the best, cannot be allowed to be the best in the
world.</p><p>Your wife is the most beautiful woman, your husband is the most
beautiful person. You are the greatest man in the world. You may not say
so, but you say it in a thousand and one ways. And whatsoever belongs to
you has to be the best. People are just like small children. Small
children go on fighting, "My daddy can lick your daddy any time."</p><p>A small boy was telling another boy, "My mother is a great orator.
She can speak on any subject for hours."</p><p>The other said, "That's nothing. My mother is such a great orator she
can speak without any subject for hours. Nobody knows what she is
speaking."</p><p>People go on bragging about their things, about everything, about
religion too.</p><p>Mulla Nasruddin's son asked him, "Pop, if a Mohammedan leaves his
religion and becomes a Hindu or a Christian, what would you call
him?"</p><p>The Mulla became very angry and he said, "He is a traitor! He should
be shot. This is the greatest sin in the world -- to change your
religion, to betray your religion. He is NAMAK HARAM -- he has betrayed
his salt."</p><p>Then the boy asked, "Then Pop, if a Hindu or a Christian becomes a
Mohammedan?"</p><p>Mulla was all smiles, Jimmy Carter smiles. He said, "That is great.
That man is wise.</p><p>That man should be welcomed and respected and honored. He knows what
is truth and he is courageous. He is a convert, my son!"</p><p>Now the thing has changed. If a Mohammedan becomes a Hindu or a
Christian he is a traitor; if a Hindu or a Christian becomes a
Mohammedan he is a convert and he is a great man and he should be
honored and respected. He is wise because he has recognized what is the
real religion.</p><p>That's how our egos function. That's why religions, rather than
bringing peace to the world, have been the cause of bloody wars. Many
more people have been killed in the name of religion than in any other
name. Not even politicians have been able to surpass the so-called
religious people in murder. The greatest murderers have been the
churches and the mosques and the temples.</p><p>In the future this ugliness has to be dropped; it should be
immediately dropped. A religion is a personal choice. If somebody does
not like the roseflower, you don't kill him and you don't say that he is
ugly, you don't say that he is wrong. You say that that is his liking.
He does not like the roseflower, it is finished. I like the roseflower.
But it is a question of liking. There is no question of truth in</p><p>it, there is no question of arguing about it and there is no reason
to prove why I don't like the rose. If I don't like, I don't like. If
you like, you like. There is no conflict. Religion should be like
that.</p><p>Somebody likes Jesus -- perfectly beautiful. Somebody likes Buddha,
somebody likes Krishna -- likings. A religion should not have anything
to do with birth. It should be a pure liking. Then there will be no
conflict, then there will be no unnecessary arguing which goes on and on
down the centuries. Rather than praying, people have been arguing.</p><p>The whole energy that they have put to argument, if it would have
been put into prayer they would have known what God is. But they go on
arguing, great debates continue, and nothing is ever proved because
nothing can ever be proved.</p><p>If you like Jesus, it is just like when you fall in love with a
woman. You cannot prove anything. Why? ... And whatsoever you prove will
look foolish to others. If you say to others, "Look at her nose -- how
long, how beautiful," people will say "That looks ugly, it is out of
shape, it is too big, the face is not in proportion." If you say, "Look
at the eyes --</p><p>so big, so beautiful," then somebody will say, "They look
frightening. I cannot stay with that woman in the night. Those two big
eyes... I am scared. And they are too big and not symmetrical!"</p><p>There is no way to prove your liking. Somebody likes Jesus and
somebody likes Buddha.</p><p>This is falling in love -- you need not prove it. And if you prove it
you will look a fool to others. That's how it looks. Hindus think people
who are in love with Jesus are foolish: What is there in this man? You
ask the Hindus? -- they have a beautiful theory of karma.</p><p>They say you suffer only if you have done wrong in your past lives.
Why was Jesus crucified? He must have done great sins; otherwise why?
Krishna is not crucified, Rama is not crucified -- why is Jesus
crucified? He must have been a sinner.</p><p>Now the whole perspective changes. Now you ask a Christian about
Krishna playing upon the flute. It looks so beautiful and Jesus on the
cross looks so sad,</p><p>and he will say,</p><p>"What are you talking about? This world is in such misery, this man
Krishna must have been of a very stony heart. He is playing on the flute
and people are dying and people are in misery and there is death and
disease and this man is playing on the flute. He must have a very very
rocklike heart. He has no heart. If he had any heart he would have
sacrificed himself for the downtrodden, for the oppressed, for those who
are in misery.</p><p>Look at Jesus -- he is the savior. He died for us so that we can be
redeemed. This Krishna looks shallow."</p><p>But ask the Hindu who follows Krishna. He will say, "What are you
talking about? There is no misery. All misery is illusion. And if people
are suffering they are suffering for their sins. Nobody else can redeem
them. And the only redeemer that can be of any help is one who brings
joy into the world. Only joy is the healing force. How can you
redeem?"</p><p>Hindus say if somebody is crying and you sit by the side and you also
cry, can you redeem him? Crying is doubled. Somebody is ill and you fall
in sympathy and lie down by their side -- how are you helping? To help
you have to be healthy. You need not fall ill. Krishna is healthy,
Krishna is joy. The world is so in misery, that's why he brings his
flute. Crosses everybody is carrying already -- what is there in
carrying a cross?</p><p>Everybody is carrying a cross. A flute is needed. Now these are the
ways and everybody can go on arguing for and against.</p><p>To me, religion is a love affair. It has nothing to do with
intellect, it has nothing to do with reason. It is falling in love. With
whomsoever you have fallen in love, that is your way. Go through it --
that is your door.</p><p>Love is the door, it is irrelevant with whom you have fallen in love.
Love redeems, neither Jesus, nor Krishna. Love redeems. Fall in love.
Love is the only redeeming force.</p><p>Love is the savior. But your egos.… Meditate over this beautiful
story:</p><p>Patrick the First, the Irish pope, was sitting in his office in the
Vatican one day, reading the CATHOLIC HERALD, when a small article in
the Irish section entitled "Record Births" caught his attention.</p><p>"Holy Mary Michael!" said the pope to his secretary, Cardinal
Fitz-Michael. "Do you see this, bejaisus!"</p><p>"And what is that, Monseigneur," said Michael, jumping up from his
paperwork.</p><p>"It says the wife of Paddy O'Flynne from Dublin has just presented
him with his fifty-sixth child," said the pope.</p><p>"The saints be praised, sir," said Michael. "Some miracle indeed, is
it not?"</p><p>"The Lord's work, to be sure," cried the pope, "and should be
commemorated in some way for the unity of the Catholic church, world
faith in general, and the Emerald Isle in particular."</p><p>"Indeed sir, what exactly do you have in mind?"</p><p>"No mind, Michael," replied the pope excitedly, "Action! Go this very
moment to the workshop, have a golden madonna stuck up, top priority
job, then run around to the travel agents and book me a first class
return flight to Dublin on Aer Lingus. I myself personally will take the
madonna as a little gift and present it to the O'Flynnes. I could do
with a little holiday in the old country."</p><p>The next morning sharp, Pope Pat, clutching the madonna, the HERALD,
and a bottle of Irish whiskey for the flight, boarded the plane for
Dublin. On arrival he went straight to O'Flynne's home whereupon he was
taken to the local pub by one of the family to where the main
celebrations were taking place.</p><p>"Someone to see you, Dad," yelled the kid to the roomful of drinkers.
"Tell him to grab a Guinness and come over!" a voice replied.</p><p>The pope grabbed a Guinness and pushed his way, madonna first, into
the center of the high-spirited group of inebriates. Some hours and many
Guinnesses later, the pope finally staggered up to Paddy and, thrusting
the madonna at him slurred, "I would like to offer my sincere
congratulations to you."</p><p>"And who do I have the honor of addressing, sir?' said Paddy,
beholding the drunken cleric, Guinness in one hand, madonna in the
other.</p><p>"Well, you don't know me personally, Paddy, but in fact I am the
pope."</p><p>"The pope!" exclaimed Paddy. "And you are in a dangerous place to be
sure. Will you have another little Guinness?"</p><p>"I will indeed," said the pope, "if you will just promise me one
thing before I do."</p><p>"For a drinking man," said Paddy, "it will be hard to refuse."</p><p>"I would like you to accept this madonna as a little gift from us all
at the Vatican and take it and put it on the altar of your local
Catholic church."</p><p>"Ah now, sir," said Paddy. "I will take the madonna, sir, to be sure,
and very grateful I am, but put it on the altar of me local catholic
church I cannot do."</p><p>"And why ever not," said the pope in amazement, "as a gift to Mother
Mary?" "Well, the truth is, sir," said Paddy, "I am not a Catholic, I am
a Protestant."</p><p>"What!" screamed the pope. "You mean to say I have come all this way
to present me golden madonna to a fucking sex maniac!"</p><p>Enough for today. The Diamond Sutra Chapter #11</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

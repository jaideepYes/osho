Rukamani asks, \"What is the matter? What happened? Where were you going so suddenly, as if there was some emergency? And now suddenly you turn back from the door and you are sad. What happened?\"\nKrishna says, \"One of my lovers, one of my devotees, is passing through a capital and people are throwing stones at him and blood is flowing from his head and he has wounds, but he remains utterly helpless -- not a condemnatory word on his lips, not even in his mind. His surrender is total. I had to rush to help him. He was so helpless!\"\nThen Rukamani is even more surprised. \"Then why did you come back?\"\nKrishna says, \"By the time I reached the door, he had taken a stone in his own hand. Now he is ready to answer himself. Now I am not needed. Now he is no more helpless.\"\nRemember, all human help becomes a barrier to divine help. My purpose here is to make you REALLY helpless, utterly helpless, so God rushes towards you and fills your emptiness.\nThat will be the day of real rejoicing, ecstasy.\nDon't ask for my help. Ask that I destroy all that you have arranged around yourself as help, comfort, consolation. Ask that I kill you. Ask that I behead you. The moment your head has rolled down on the earth, you will grow a new head, and that head will be the divine. That will be God's head.\nOsho - The First Principle 108\nChapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence 7\nThe Song of Sound and Silence\n17 April 1977 am in Buddha Hall\nA PUZZLED MONK ONCE SAID TO FUKETSU, \"YOU SAY TRUTH CAN BE\nEXPRESSED WITHOUT SPEAKING, AND WITHOUT KEEPING SILENT. HOW CAN\nTHIS BE?\" FUKETSU ANSWERED, \"IN SOUTHERN CHINA, IN THE SPRING, WHEN I WAS ONLY A LAD, AH! HOW THE BIRDS SANG AMONG THE BLOSSOMS.\"\nGod IS. Truth IS. Love IS. There is no way to say it, and there is no way to hide it. There is no word which can express it, and there is no methodology of how to keep it unexpressed.\nThat is the dilemma of the mystic. He has to say it, and it cannot be said. He cannot keep quiet about it, he cannot keep silent. It overfloods him; it starts overflowing; it is beyond him to keep silent. He has to say it, and nobody has ever been able to say it.\nGod is not a word, neither is truth a word, nor is love a word. And they are not just silences either, because their isness is a singing isness; they are songs. It is not just dull and dead there. It is full of joy, it is overflowing joy. It is celebration, it is ecstasy, it is orgasm, because it is a meeting of the opposites, because it is a meeting of the polarities, because it is a marriage, a marriage of yin and yang, day and night, summer and winter, life and death, sound and silence.\nSo when it happens, you cannot say it, but you have to sing it, and that is the beauty of the song. It has something of the word and something of silence in it. That is the beauty of poetry, the beauty of dance. Something is visible, something is invisible; the manifest and the unmanifest meet there, embrace each other, are fulfilled in each other.\nIf you simply say and use words and there is no silence in those words, your words will be like dead stones. They can hit somebody's head, you can argue with them, but you cannot convert. They don't have that quality of silence which becomes conversion. When a word has a silence at its innermost core, when a word is luminous with silence, it brings conversion.\nThen it is a gospel, then it is good news. Then somebody, who is saying something with silence in it, is not throwing a dead rock at you, but is throwing a flower. It will also hit you, but it will also caress you, and it will go deeper because you can be vulnerable to it and it will reach to your very heart. Because how can you protect yourself against it? You will be nondefensive.\nSo remember, all the mystics have been singing and dancing, celebrating. They go on saying, \"We cannot say it,\" and they go on saying all the same.\nThere is a difference in saying and saying. When you say without knowing it, without realizing it, it is just gibberish, just words and words and words, without any soul in them; it is a corpse; there is no aliveness in it. Those words stink -- they stink of death. There is no heartbeat of life. When you know, when you have experienced, when you have fallen into that abyss called God, when you are transformed by that surrender, when you are totally immersed in it, when your every cell is bathed in it, then you say; but your words are not mere words.\nOsho - The First Principle 109\nChapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence\nThey carry silence. They are vehicles of silence; they are gestures of silence. We have a special name for it in the East: MAHAMUDRA -- the great gesture.\nLook at my hand. If it is empty, if there is nobody behind it who has experienced, then it is an ordinary gesture. But if there is somebody behind it who has known, who has lived, who has experienced, then raising this hand is a great gesture, MAHAMUDRA. Then the ordinary hand becomes extraordinary. Then ordinary words are no more ordinary words. You cannot go to the dictionary to find their meaning. When a word is full of silence, you will have to go within yourself to find its meaning, not to a dictionary, not to a library. You will have to go within yourself. The meaning will be found in your experience.\nThe word of a man who knows is loaded, loaded with great fragrance. You will have to decode it in your innermost core of being, into the innermost shrine of your being.\nTruth is a transcendence, transcendence of all duality. So those who say truth\ncannot be said, only say a half-truth; and those who say that truth can be said only in silence, they also say a half-truth.\nZen brings the whole truth to the world. Zen is a great blessing to the world; it brings the whole truth.\nThe whole truth is: Truth cannot be said, and yet can be said. If not said, then showed, indicated. The ordinary duality is transcended. We are always moving from one pole of the duality to the other. Sometimes we say, \"Yes, it can be said\"; this is one pole. Then we become aware, \"How can it be said?\" -- the other pole. Then we keep silent, but then again we become aware that there is something left: \"Yes, it can be said.\" This way it goes on moving, it swings.\nZen says truth is a transcendence, transcendence of all duality. The duality between the word and the silence is also to be transcended.\nThe Bible says in the beginning there was the word. The Vedas say in the beginning there was silence, eternal silence, and the silence brooded over the sea, and it was dark. And the Bible says there was the word. The first thing that happened in existence was the word. God said let there be light, and there was light. Both are half-truths.\nIf you ask the Zen people ... They have not written any Bible or any Veda yet, and they will never try, because they don't believe in scriptures. They say it is beyond the scriptures; it is a transmission beyond the scriptures. But if they ever write a Bible, or if they are forced to, like Lao Tzu was once forced to write the Tao Te Ching because the king wouldn't allow him to leave the country unless he wrote his experiences ...\nLao Tzu wanted to go to the Himalayas, to die there; certainly there cannot be any more beautiful a place to die. Those eternal peaks, those snow -- covered virgin peaks, where can you find a better place to disappear in God? What better moment? He wanted to go -- he was very old and he wanted to go to the Himalayas to rest and disappear there, nobody ever knowing about him. He wanted to disappear absolutely alone. He wanted his death to be private.\nAnd death is a private thing. Nobody else can be with you when you die; it is absolutely internal. So he wanted to escape and go away from the crowds. He was afraid too many people will surround him and his death will become a public affair.\nOsho - The First Principle 110\nChapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence\nBut the king insisted, \"First you write whatsoever you have known.\" And he ordered the guards on the boundary saying that \"This man is not to be allowed to go out.\" So he was caught at a guard post, and for three days he sat in the guards' room and wrote down the Tao Te Ching.\nIf somebody, forces a Zen Master to write down a Bible, a Veda, then they will say there was song in the beginning. Neither word nor silence, but song. There was song in the beginning, and God sang and danced. Not \"Let there be light\": God sang and danced. And that dance became the beginning of creation.\nThat dance continues. That dance is what existence is.\nThe song has a mystery about it because it is a meeting, a marriage of opposites. In the song there is sound and silence. The song says something, but says in such a way that you cannot grasp it. Not that it doesn't say anything. It makes much available, but you cannot grasp it, you cannot just possess it. If you try to possess, you will kill it. You cannot have a song in your fist; otherwise the song will be killed. It is too delicate; you cannot be that rough with it.\nA song has to be preserved in the heart, not in the fist. About a song you have to be receptive, not aggressive. You can keep an argument in the fist; it is hard, rocklike, it will not die. You can keep and possess an argument, you can become the possessor of an argument. That's why the ego enjoys very much to have arguments, proofs, logic, philosophies. The ego feels very much fulfilled: \"I know so much.\"\nThe song cannot be possessed that way; the ego cannot be its possessor. The song can penetrate your being, but the ego has to give way. If the ego comes in between, the song will be shattered. You may get fragments of it, and you may start interpreting those fragments, but you will miss the unity of it. And it was in the unity.\nA song has not to be thought about. If you start thinking, about a song, you are already missing it. When you listen to music, how do you listen? Do you bring\nyour mind in? If you bring your mind in, where is the music? Music and the mind both cannot exist together. That is the mystery of music: you have to put your mind aside. You cannot argue with music; you cannot nod your head in agreement or disagreement. You cannot say, \"Yes, I agree,\" or \"No, I don't agree.\" There is no question of agreement or no agreement. With music you simply become one. If you want to feel it you have to put your head aside. The heart has to open towards it. It goes directly to the heart, it showers on the heart. It helps the flower of the heart to open and bloom. It is a nourishment for the inner lotus.\nThe Zen people will say, \"There was song in the beginning, and then God sang and God danced, and that's what he has been doing since then.\" Each moment it is a dance. Look around. Can't you hear these birds? These are not birds; don't be deceived by them. These are not birds. It is God singing, the God of the beginnings -- because it is always a beginning.\nEach moment is a beginning. Never think that the beginning was somewhere in the past. This is the beginning, and it is always the beginning and there is no end. It is God singing.\nCan't you hear the silence of the trees? It is God, silent.\nIn the birds he is singing, in the trees he is silent. Birds cannot exist without the trees, and, let me tell you, the trees cannot exist without the birds either. The birds sing for the trees, and the trees are silent for the birds, and there is a marriage. They are tied together. If trees disappear, birds will disappear. Kill all the birds of the world, and you will one day see the trees are disappearing. Everything is intertwined, everything is interlinked. This is what we mean by the word \"ecology\" -- everything is together.\nOsho - The First Principle 111\nChapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence It is God singing, it is God silent.\nOnce you understand that God is both, then this highest possibility opens for you. This is the first principle, that you need not divide, all division is false, that\nyou need not create any duality, because existence is nondual, because existence is one.\nAnd all our misery is because we are divided. Why do you feel so thrilled when you are in love? What happens? Is the thrill just chemical, hormonal? No, it is not. The thrill is existential. When you are in love, at least with one person you feel to be one, at least with one person you have dropped duality, at least with one person you are no more separate, at least with one person the boundaries are not there. You have removed the boundaries. Two spaces have come so close, they overlap. You feel so thrilled with love, so blissful with love, because it is an experience of God, a very limited experience of course.\nAnd if it is so beautiful to be one with one person, how much more beautiful will it be to be one with the whole, to be one with all the persons, men and women, trees and birds and animals and the clouds and the mountains and the stars? How will it be? How much more beautiful? The beauty cannot be imagined, because the difference will not be only of quantity, it will be of quality. It will be utterly different.\nLove can at the most be only a glimpse of a ray, not the ray itself, but only a glimpse in the lake. A ray of the sun playing on the lake, and you see the glimpse. That glimpse is love.\nWhen you find out the real ray, it becomes prayer. When you start moving through that ray, upwards, you start climbing on that ray and you start reaching towards the source of all light, then you are growing in spirituality. One day you are dissolved into that light. You yourself have become that light. That is the orgasm I talk about. That's ecstasy.\nAnd Zen people say that when you know, you have to say, knowing well that it cannot be said. You have to sing it.\nZen Masters have been very creative. Either they were singers, dancers, or painters, or in some sort of art, calligraphy, pottery. Whatsoever they could do they did. That became the gesture of their expression. They were not inactive people. Deep down they were not doers, and on the surface they were not inactive at all. Deep down they were just instrumental to the divine. No doer, no idea of doing anything -- just being, but on the surface very creative. The world would have been far richer if every religion had developed such a school as Zen.\nFor example, Hindu monks have lived a very uncreative life. Jaina monks have lived a very uncreative life. Except Zen, even Buddhists have lived a very uncreative life. So has been the case with the Catholics.\nZen brings creativity. And remember, if you want to be one with the creator, you will have to learn some ways of creativity. The only way to be one with the creator is to be in some moment of creativity, when you are lost. The potter is lost in making his pottery; the potter is lost while working on the wheel. The painter is lost while painting. The dancer is lost; there is no dancer, only the dance remains. Those are the peak moments, where you touch God, where God touches you.\nNow, the scholar, the so-called scholar, becomes wordy. He goes on learning more words, more words, more information, more scriptures. He has no silence. That is a very lopsided phenomenon. Then against the scholar there are a few saints, who keep quiet; they don't even say a single word. That too is moving to the other extreme. They become uncreative. Of course, they are silent, better than the scholar -- at least they will not throw their rubbish into Osho - The First Principle\n112\nChapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence\nother people's heads, at least they are not committing any crime -- but in a higher sense they are also criminals because they are not benefiting existence. They are parasites. They are not making existence richer by their being here. They are not helping God in his dance, in his song.\nZen brings the highest synthesis. Don't be afraid of speaking, but don't go on speaking if you don't know. Don't be silent. Just being silent will not help.\nIt has to be understood because too many times this comes to your mind too: Why go on speaking? Why not keep quiet? But your silence will be YOUR silence. The words will go on moving, revolving inside you. You will become a madhouse inside. You may look silent from the outside; you will not be silent inside. How can you simply drop those words, those old habits of many lives? The mind will go on chattering, the mind will go on saying things, repeating things. The mind is like an automaton; even if you don't want to talk the mind goes on. If you don't talk to others it goes on talking to itself. It creates both the\nparties: it talks from one side and answers from another side; it goes on playing the game. From the outside one can be easily silent, but from the inside?\nAnd if you are silent from the inside, you will be surprised that your silence becomes so loaded with ecstasy that you have to sing. There is no other way. That you have to dance, that you have to share. When you have you have to share. If you have it at all you will have to share. If you don't have it you can keep quiet, but what is the point of keeping quiet if you don't have it?\nThere are two types of people: one who goes on talking without having it, and one who goes on keeping silent without having it. Both are in the same boat.\nThere is a third type of person, who has come to know it, who has really become silent and in the silence he has heard the soundless sound, in the silence God has delivered his message to him. God has spoken to him. He has had a dialogue with God himself. The silence has filled his heart with so much juice, with so much life, with life abundant, that he is bursting.\nHe has to say it. There is no way to get rid of it.\nAnd his saying will have a totally different significance because words will not be mere words. If such a person sits silently, even his silence will be a sharing. If such a person keeps completely silent, you will see his silence is singing all around him. You will feel the vibe.\nHis silence is saying something. He is indicating from his silence too. If he speaks he speaks.\nIf he is silent, then too he speaks.\nIf you don't sing it, remember, you don't have it. If it does not overflow in a thousand and one gestures, then it is not there. You cannot hold it if it is there. And you cannot possess it if it is there; it is not your property. You cannot become the owner of it. You cannot hoard it, you cannot be miserly about it. If it is there at all, it drowns you utterly. It possesses you. You cannot possess it; it possesses you. And then it leads you into a thousand and one gestures. In a thousand and one streams you start flowing, and whatsoever you do becomes an expression.\nI have heard a very beautiful legend. The legend is, there was a great Master in\nIndia, the twenty-seventh successor of Gautam the Buddha; his name was Hanyatara. A king in south India requested him to come to his court. The king himself came, bowed down to Hanyatara, touched his feet, and said, \"Please, come to my court, to bless us. And this has been my desire, to listen to some sutras of Gautam the Buddha by a man who is a Buddha himself, so I have been avoiding scholars, pundits, professors. I have been avoiding, I have been waiting, Osho - The First Principle\n113\nChapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence\nbecause those sutras that Buddha uttered are so pregnant that only a man who has attained to that consciousness will be able to give expression to them.\"\nHanyatara came to the court with an attendant. The king was thrilled; it was his dream for his whole life one day to have a Buddha in his court, in his palace. The whole palace was decorated, the whole town was decorated; the whole capital was celebrating. It was a great day of celebration. But the king was puzzled, a little bewildered: Hanyatara sat silently, not saying a single word, and the attendant recited the sutra. Now, this was not the purpose at all. The king could have found better people to recite the sutra than the attendant. He was just an attendant who looked after Hanyatara, just used to do small errands, a very ordinary man, not even a great scholar. His grammar was faulty, his pronunciation was not exactly as it should be. He was an ordinary man.\nJust out of respect, the king kept silent. When the sutra was finished, he touched the feet of Hanyatara and said, \"Sir, enlighten me about this; otherwise I will remain puzzled. Why did not YOU recite the sutra?\"\nAnd Hanyatara said, \"What, I did not recite the sutra? Then what else was I doing the whole time here? You fool!\"\nThe king was even more puzzled, because he had kept quiet, he had not said a single word.\nThe king said, \"Please, explain it to me. I don't understand. I am an ordinary, ignorant person.\nI may not know the ways of the Buddhas.\"\nAnd Hanyatara said, \"I sat silently, breathing in, breathing out. That was my sutra. What else is there in life? Breathe in, breathe out. Be alert, aware. When I breathed in, I was aware; when I breathed out, I was aware. It was all awareness! What else is a sutra? Awareness. If you had listened to the rhythm of my breathing you would have understood. I have recited it!\nWords are one way to recite it. Breathing silently, but with full awareness, is another way to recite it -- and far better a way. I have been very expressive today, as I have never been before.\nThinking that you have been waiting for so long, I thought, 'Why not give the real thing?' \"\nThe king was thrilled, seeing the compassion. Now he felt there was a certain rhythm in his silence. Now he became aware, retrospectively of course, that this man was not silent in the ordinary way. He had seen silent people; sometimes he himself had sat in silence. This was a different silence. There was a song, certainly there was a song. There was a fragrance around this man. There was a vibe of a different quality; he was vibrating. Strange it was, but now he remembered, yes, it was there. And the way he was breathing was no ordinary way.\nNot that he was doing anything special in the breathing: his breathing was pure, natural, like a small baby.\nWhen you breathe, your breathing is never natural. If you are a little angry, your anger changes your breathing. If you are full of passion, lust, your lust changes your breathing. If you are greedy, your greed is reflected in your breathing. Continuously your mind mood infiltrates breathing and changes it. You can watch it. When you are angry, try not to disturb the breathing, and you will be completely unable to be angry. Just try not to change the breathing. Let the breathing remain as it was before you became angry, and then try to be angry. It will be impossible. The breathing has to change first. Through the breathing the body changes; the mind first affects the breathing. When you are in a moment of lust, watch, keep the breathing natural, and you will suddenly find the lust has disappeared, the moment came and passed.\nOsho - The First Principle 114\nChapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence\nBy and by you will be able to see each mood is reflected in your breathing, so your breathing is never natural, because there is some mood or other. The natural breathing means there is no mood: that means there is no mind -- neither anger nor greed nor lust nor jealousy nor love nor hate. No -- mood means no-mind. In that state of no-mind the breathing is natural. Then there is a song to it, then there is a totally different quality to it. Then it is pure life. Then the flame is without smoke.\nYes, the king remembered, there was something strange, something was happening. He had missed it. He started crying. He said, \"I have missed it. Why didn't you tell me before?\nNow I know there was something, and I had even felt it, but my consciousness is not so developed, so I could not understand what was happening.\n\"And I was too concerned about that foolish sutra. I was continuously thinking about why you were not reciting the sutra and why this attendant was reciting the sutra. I was so much concerned about the sutra that I missed.\n\"But I am grateful that you showed such compassion, that you showed your being so naked, so true, so authentic.\"\nHe presented a great diamond, the most valuable he had, to Hanyatara, and then he said to Hanyatara, \"I have three sons. Sir, be kind enough. I will call them. Bless them.\"\nThinking that young people are young people, and the youngest was only seven, they may disturb the sutra reciting, he had not called them to participate before.\nThe three young princes came in.\nRather than blessing them, Hanyatara showed the diamond that the king had presented to him to the first prince, the eldest. He must have been somewhere near fifteen. The prince looked at the diamond and said, \"A great diamond, of the finest water, purest water. Where could you get it? It is rare. It is no ordinary diamond.\"\nYes, his understanding about the diamond was perfectly true. It was a rare\ndiamond, of the most perfect water. Even Hanyatara had never seen such a thing.\nThen he called the second prince, who must have been near about ten, and the second prince looked at the diamond, and he said, \"Not only the finest, not only the best, it is certain that it belongs to my father because in this kingdom nobody can have such a diamond. It is rare. Sir, it does not belong to you, it cannot. To protect this diamond you will need a great army, otherwise you cannot have it. Just this attendant won't do.\"\nYes, his understanding was also very correct.\nAnd then the third son was called. He was only seven. He looked at the diamond, looked at Hanyatara, and laughed and said, \"What? Do you want to befool me?\" He was only seven, and he said, \"Do you want to befool me? You cannot! Because the real diamonds are never of the outside. And what are you trying to show me? You have the real diamond within YOU. I can see it! This is just a stone that you have in your hand. Throw it, sir!\"\nAnd it is said that Hanyatara hugged this small boy.\nThis boy's name was Bodhitara, and Hanyatara changed his name to Bodhidharma. He became the twenty-eighth successor of Buddha; he was the first patriarch of Zen in China, this small boy Bodhitara, whose name Hanyatara changed to Bodhidharma.\nOsho - The First Principle 115\nChapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence\nHanyatara said, \"This boy has looked into the deepest reality anybody can look into.\nDHARMA means 'the ultimate reality'. He has penetrated to the ultimate reality.\" He said to the king, \"Even you could not see who I am. That's why you missed my sermon, my silent sermon. That's why you missed my silent song. I was singing here but you missed. But this boy, yes, I cannot befool him. This boy is going to be my successor.\"\nAnd then he said to the king, \"Sir, forgive me. I have not come for you and I have not come because you requested me to. I had to come because of this boy. I have been in search of this boy! This has been a promise from the past life, and this has been a decided gesture: in the past life I told this boy, 'I will seek you and find you and I will show you a diamond, and that will be the moment of your examination. If you can see my inner diamond and you are not befooled, you will be my successor.'\"\nThe legend is of tremendous value. First, the silent sermon. Yes, sometimes a mystic can be silent -- but he is not silent! His silence is a very telling silence. He may not do anything, he may not even move his eyes, he may not move any of his limbs, but still his presence goes on doing a thousand and one things. Just to be in his presence, just to breathe with him in the same rhythm, and something is transferred: his song, his silence, his dance. You will never be the same again.\nTruth is not hidden, from the very beginning. Truth is unhidden; only your eyes are closed.\nTruth is being preached from every tree and from every bird and from every rock and from every star; just your eyes, your ears, your sensitivity is not there. You are deaf. Truth is not dumb; you are deaf. And truth is not hiding anywhere.\nA man came to a Zen Master and asked, \"Sir, where should I go to find the truth?\" And the Zen Master said, \"You just keep looking in front of your nose and go on, and you will find it.\nIt is just in front of your nose! Truth is just in front of you. In fact, wherever you look it is truth, you just need to know how to look for it. But you are looking for other things; that's why you go on missing.\nThat great king missed Hanyatara's sermon. It was a Zen sermon, the same as Buddha preached to the first Zen Master, Mahakashyap, sitting silently, holding a flower in his hand.\nThis second sermon, of Hanyatara to the king, was even more subtle. He was not even holding a flower in his hand. He was just breathing in and out, a natural breathing, an ordinary breathing, unaffected by the mind. And truth was there and the sutras were recited there through his breathing, but the king missed.\nYou may have come across a Buddha in your life -- or you may have come\nacross many Buddhas in your past lives -- but you have missed because you were not sensitive enough to feel that vibe. That vibe is subtle. You were not aware enough to move to that height, to feel the presence.\nBe a little more alert. The sermon is preached constantly. From everywhere God is speaking to you. Even when everything is silent he is speaking through silence. His song is eternal.\nZen says, \"Truth is not hidden, from the very beginning, so you are not to uncover truth, you are only to uncover your eyes.\" You just have a curtain on your eyes. Just pull your earplugs out. Your ears are plugged; hence you cannot hear.\nOsho - The First Principle 116\nChapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence\nHow to unplug the ears? How to open the eyes? How to drop barriers that don't allow you to become sensitive enough? What is the way? The way is IMMEDIACY. Be immediate, be in the moment.\nOtherwise Buddhas can go on shouting from the housetops, and you will not hear -- or you will hear something which has not been said at all.\nA few scenes. First scene:\nWarden: \"Can't you see the sign 'NO FISHING HERE'?\"\nAngler: \"Yes, and I don't agree. There is good fishing here! Just look at this lot I have landed today. Whoever put that sign up must be crazy.\"\nThe second scene:\nThe Dean of Women was lecturing to a class on the subject of sex morality. \"In moments of temptation, ask yourself just one question: Is an hour of pleasure worth a lifetime of shame?\"\nOne of the girls raised her hand naively and asked, \"How do you make it last one\nhour?\"\nThe third scene:\nEthel was shapely out shy, and visited a doctor for the first time. He ushered her into his private office and said, \"Now, my dear, please get completely undressed.\"\nEthel blushed and replied, \"Okay, Doctor, but you first.\" Fourth scene:\nThe following ad appeared in the Personal column of a London paper: \"My husband and I have four sons. Has anyone any suggestions as to how we may have a daughter?\" Letters poured in from all over the world. An American wrote, \"If at first you don't succeed, try, try, and try again.\" A Buddhist from Thailand suggested that they should seek the help of Buddha.\nA South African recommended a special diet. An Indian proposed yoga. A Frenchman merely wrote, \"May I be of service?\"\nAnd the last and the fifth scene:\nA lion tamer had quit without notice, and the circus manager needed someone to replace him for the next night's show. He put an ad in the local paper, and the next morning two Osho - The First Principle\n117\nChapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence\napplicants showed up outside his office. One was a rather ordinary looking young man, and the other a ravishing redheaded beauty. Neither one of them looked very much like a lion trainer, but the manager was desperate. \"All right,\" he said. \"Here is a whip, a chair, and a gun. Let us see what you can do with the big Leo over there. We will let you have the first try, miss, but be careful. He is a mean one.\"\nThe ravishing redhead strode past the whip, the chair, and the gun, and empty-\nhanded, fearlessly entered the cage. Big Leo rose, snarling, then came charging across the cage towards her with a ferocious roar. When the lion was almost upon her the girl threw open her coat.\nUnderneath, she was stark naked. Leo skidded to a stop and crawled the rest of the way on his belly. He nuzzled the girl's feet with his nose, purred, and licked her trim ankles.\nThe astonished circus manager grinned happily and turned to the pop-eyed young man.\n\"Well, young fella,\" he asked, \"think you can top that?\"\n\"Yeah,\" panted the applicant. \"Just get that stupid lion out of there.\"\nTruth is all around, but your interpretations are YOUR interpretations. God is speaking all the time, but you hear not, or even if you hear, you hear something else. You hear according to you, your mind comes in, and hence you go on missing.\nUnless the mind is dropped you will not be able to know what truth is. Truth cannot be discovered by mind; mind is the barrier. It is because of the mind that you have not been able to discover it. It is not a question of how to train the mind to know the truth. The more the mind is trained and becomes capable, the less is the possibility to know the truth. The more skilled a mind, the farther away you are from the truth.\nMind is the barrier. No-mind is the door.\nHow to attain to no-mind? The only way -- the ONLY way -- is to be in the present. The only way is not to think of the past, not to think of the future. And you cannot think of the present. That is the whole secret: you cannot think of the present; there is not space enough for thought to move. Thought needs room to move. Can you think anything right now? If you think it, either it will be of the past or of the future.\nThis moment of silence. If you think, \"Yes, this is a moment of silence,\" it is already past.\nOr you say, \"How beautiful!\" It is already past. Utter a word \"beautiful,\" and it is\nalready past.\nYou cannot think. Thinking stops when you are in the present. So that is the only key, and it is a master key; it unlocks all the doors of being. Immediacy, that is the whole insistence of Zen.\nIf you go to a Zen Master and you ask something, it is unpredictable what he will do to you. He may hit you. Or he may not hit you; he may hit himself! Or he may say something absurd, totally irrelevant to what you have asked. Somebody asks, \"How to attain Buddhahood?\" and the Master says, \"The cypress tree in the courtyard.\" Now what? How are they related? They are not, but the Master is indicating, \"Please, drop all this nonsense. Look at this -- THIS -- cypress tree in the courtyard. What nonsense are you talking about? --\nBuddha, and how to become a Buddha. You are talking about the past and the future. You have heard about Buddha in the past, so you have a greed, a desire. Now you want to become a Buddha in the future, so you have come to me. All nonsense.\" He simply gives something immediate; he says, \"Look! The cypress tree in the courtyard.\" It is not relevant if you think in terms of the mind. If you think in terms of no-mind it is the only thing relevant.\nOsho - The First Principle 118\nChapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence\nA man comes to a Zen Master and asks, \"What is the way?\" And the Master says, \"Listen,\"\nand everything becomes silent, and just by the side of the Master's hut flows a fountain, and the water is making the sound, the murmur. The sound of the water, the sound of the running water. For a moment everything is silent, the seeker, the questioner, is also. The Master says,\n\"Listen. Hear. This is the way.\" The sound of the running water? That's all he has heard. And the Master says, \"Hear! This is the way to become a Buddha, to attain to enlightenment.\" He is bringing the mind to an immediacy, to a state of immediacy.\nWhat is he saying? He is not saying anything about the sound of the running water. In that moment, when suddenly the Master shocked the inquirer -- because he was asking about the way to attain to nirvana, and the Master says, \"Listen\", it is so out of context, it is so unrelated to his question, that for a moment, out of the shock of it, the sheer shock of it, everything becomes silent. And when the Master says, \"Hear. This is the way.\" He is not saying anything about the running water or its sound. He is indicating the silent moment that has penetrated into the consciousness of the inquirer. He says, \"Hear. This is the way.\"\nIf you become immediate you attain. If you live moment to moment you attain. Once a Western psychiatrist went to see a Zen\nMaster in Japan. \"How do you deal with neurotics?\" he asked. The Master replied, simply, \"I trap them.\"\nTrap them? The psychiatrist could not understand what he means by trapping them. How can you trap a neurotic? The neurotic will trap you!\n\"But how?\" pressed the psychiatrist.\nThe Master replied, \"I get them to where they cannot ask any more questions.\" Then they are trapped, if they cannot ask any more questions.\nIf the mind is allowed to ask questions, then the mind goes on and on, so the Zen Master brings you down to the immediate facticity of life. Sometimes he may hit you. By hitting, suddenly you are herenow. It is great compassion.\nYou ask, \"Has God created the world?\" and the Master hits you, sharply. For a moment you are puzzled, shocked. For a moment all thinking stops. The very shock of it, the unpredictableness of it. For a moment, certainly, certainly for a moment, everything stops.\nAnd the Master says, \"This, this is how God created the world.\" This is how God goes on creating the world. This moment of pure silence, this moment of no- mind, is the door to all solutions, to salvation, to liberation.\nThis is unique; sometimes a Master will do something which you had not expected at all.\nAnd the Master can do that only if he is not following certain rules. He is not following any. If he simply repeats from old Masters, then disciples become acquainted with it. No, sometimes he will do something you cannot believe.\nOsho - The First Principle 119\nChapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence\nThere was a Zen Master who used to talk about God or Buddha, but whenever he would talk about God or Buddha or the ultimate reality he would raise his hand: one finger pointing towards the sky. This became a joke among his disciples. Whenever they would talk about such great things they would raise their fingers and point to God. A small young boy was the attendant of the Master; he used to bring his tea and things like that. He became a perfect master in showing his finger, and he was always there and the Master was always doing it to everybody, so he became very perfect; he could imitate it perfectly.\nAnd the Master was aware of it. Sometimes he would be standing by the side at the back and the Master would raise his finger and he would also raise his finger and everybody would laugh -- and the Master was aware of what was happening.\nOne day the boy did that, and the Master called him in front of him, took a sharp knife, and cut off his finger. The boy's finger was cut off. The pain was sharp; the boy shrieked. And the Master said, \"Stop! Now do it. Now do it! Whatsoever you have been doing for so long --\nnow do it without the finger!\"\nAnd when the Master shouted, \"Stop!\" all pain disappeared in that moment, there was silence. And the small young boy showed the finger which was not there anymore, blood was flowing. But it is said in that moment he became enlightened.\nNow, it is possible. That very sharpness of it.\nAnother story. In a Zen Master's ashram there were five hundred monks, and there were two wings. Just in the middle was the Master's hut; on one side was one wing, on the other side the other wing. There was a beautiful cat, and there was a great debate between these two sides as to whom it belonged. It almost became a quarrel, and things went to such a state that both the wings were ready to kill each other for the cat. To whom does it belong? The left wing was saying, \"It belongs to us\"; and the right wing was saying. \"It belongs to us.\" It was a really beautiful cat.\nThe Master heard it. He called the whole ashram, and the cat was brought, and he said,\n\"Now, give me a true answer, any one of you, and the cat will belong to him. Stand up and show your understanding of reality, any one of you. And if you don't show within seconds, I will cut the cat in two, and one part will go to the left side and one part will go to the right side.\"\nThey were shocked. They could not find out how to respond to the Master's demand. What to do so that the cat can be saved? What to do? They started thinking. In their very thinking they missed the moment because when you think, you cannot be immediate and you cannot show your understanding of reality. You cannot show the understanding of immediacy. Not a single monk out of those five hundred could show.\nFor seconds the Master waited, then took a sword, cut the cat in two; half the cat was given to each wing, and he disposed of it. He said, \"Now go.\" They were all sorry.\nBy the evening, one monk, who had gone outside, came back. When he came in to see the Master, he was just taking his shoes off, and the Master said, \"Where have you been? Were you not there when I cut the cat in two? I had told the other monks that if they can show some understanding of reality the cat can be saved. Where have you been?\"\nThe young man, who had taken off one shoe and was going to take off the other shoe, took that shoe, put it on his head, walked back.\nOsho - The First Principle 120\nChapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence\nAnd the Master called him, \"Come, my son. Had you been here the cat would be alive still.\nThe cat could have been saved if you were here.\"\nThat immediacy. Not that this is the answer, but the immediacy. That was the moment. He allowed it to happen. It was not done with the mind, with thinking. It was done without any thinking, it was done without any mind. He simply said that it is as foolish as me having my shoe on my head to cut the cat. It is as foolish. But it was not an answer from the mind. It was an immediate response. And the Master said, \"My boy, if you had been here, the cat would have been alive. But those fools could not show any understanding.\"\nNow this small, beautiful anecdote:\nA PUZZLED MONK ONCE SAID TO FUKETSU, \"YOU SAY TRUTH CAN BE\nEXPRESSED WITHOUT SPEAKING, AND WITHOUT KEEPING SILENT. HOW CAN\nTHIS BE?\"\nFUKETSU ANSWERED, \"IN SOUTHERN CHINA, IN THE SPRING, WHEN I WAS\nONLY A LAD, AH! HOW THE BIRDS SANG AMONG THE BLOSSOMS. \"\nA very simple anecdote, but with great significance. Meditate over it. A PUZZLED MONK ONCE SAID TO FUKETSU ...\nFrom where do you become puzzled? From the mind. The mind is always dividing things, and then cannot figure it out. Once you divide, there is conflict and confusion. How can it be?\nOnce you divide -- this is good, this is bad -- then the question arises: \"Why has God created a world where so much evil exists?\" You divide, that this is good\nand this is bad, and once you divide, then the problem arises: \"Why has God created such a world where so much evil exists, so much bad?\"\nNow, you call God \"God\" because you think he is good. God is both and neither. Division is yours. It is your problem; it is not God's problem. You say, \"Why do so many people die?\nWhy has God created a world where death happens?\" You don't understand at all. First you divide life in two parts, life and death. It is undivided. For God death is as beautiful as birth; they are both parts of the same phenomenon. For the whole there is no distinction between birth and death. Birth is a death, and death is a birth. They both are the same: two polarities, two which can exist only in togetherness. Life cannot exist without death, and neither can death exist without life.\nHave you ever observed the fact? All that you love in life is possible only because of death. You love a woman because today she is beautiful, tomorrow she may not be. Old age.\nToday she is here, tomorrow she may not be there. Death is possible. You love the woman. If you knew that the beauty is eternal, that always and always the woman will be beautiful and that nobody is going to die, will there be joy in life? It will be sheer boredom. And if it was impossible even to commit suicide, you cannot conceive of a more miserable life -- just people living and living and doing the same thing again and again and again and nothing ever Osho - The First Principle\n121\nChapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence\nchanges and everything is eternal, nobody ever dies. Just think if all the people that have lived on the earth were living now -- there will not be any space even to stand -- and everybody was eternal ... Life will lose all beauty. The beauty is in its momentariness.\nThat's why I go on insisting: Celebrate the temporal. By celebrating it you will know that this is the way the eternal functions. The temporal is a function of the eternal.\nCelebrate the temporal. Celebrate the momentary. In the momentary is the eternal, hiding.\nDon't throw it away. If you throw the momentary you are throwing the baby with the bathwater. The eternal is hidden there. The eternal comes in the momentary, penetrates the moment.\nA PUZZLED MONK ONCE SAID TO FUKETSU ...\nWhat was his bewilderment? What was his confusion? Why was he so puzzled? The puzzle was there because he says the Master has said ... \"YOU SAY TRUTH CAN BE\nEXPRESSED WITHOUT SPEAKING, AND WITHOUT KEEPING SILENT. \"\nNow, this is impossible; this is very contradictory. If you say, \"Truth can be expressed by words,\" okay. If you say, \"Truth cannot be expressed by words,\" then it naturally means,\n\"Truth can be expressed by silence.\" But the Master says, \"Truth cannot be expressed by words, and truth cannot be expressed by silence.\" And the Master says, \"Truth can be expressed by words too, and it can be expressed by silence too.\" Now, it is confusing. Now, it is illogical, it is absurd.\nHow can this be that truth can be expressed without speaking and without keeping silent?\nOne can do only one; either one can speak it or one can keep silent. You deny both? Then what is the possibility?\nFUKETSU ANSWERED, \"IN SOUTHERN CHINA, IN THE SPRING, WHEN I WAS\nONLY A LAD, AH! HOW THE BIRDS SANG AMONG THE BLOSSOMS.\"\nNow, this is very irrelevant. What the disciple is asking and what the Master is saying is not related at all, but it is related in a nonmind way. Meditate over it, how it is related in a nonmind way.\nHe has said many things. First, he says \"IN THE SPRING'.' First, he says,\n\"When the spring came, HOW THE BIRDS SANG AMONG THE BLOSSOMS.\" They were expressing truth, but they were silent when the spring was not there; and when the spring came they sang, they burst forth into celebration. So the first thing is \"when the spring is there\". What does he mean? He means when you have the spring in your heart, when the light has dawned upon you, when the right maturity has happened, when the right climate has happened, when your fruit is ripe, when the spring has come -- that is what satori is, the spring of the inner heart --\nwhen the SAMADHI has come, then you need not bother: the birds don't go to schools to learn how to sing. The spring has come. They don't seek teachers. They don't go in to anybody, they don't ask the elders, \"How to sing? The spring has come.\" When the spring comes the spring starts singing in them.\nOsho - The First Principle 122\nChapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence\nWhat the Master means is that when SAMADHI is there, you will know. How to say it without saying it and without keeping silent -- you will know it. It is not a question.\nMany people go on asking foolish questions. The question was foolish. People come to me, they say, \"If we become enlightened, what will happen to our family?\" You please first become enlightened. \"If we become enlightened what will become of our business?\" You first become enlightened. Right now you are asking it as if it will create some problem. It has never created any problem. Whenever somebody becomes enlightened, he knows what to do. If an enlightened person does not know what to do, then who will know?\nIf you come to me and you ask me, \"When truth has happened, how are we going to express it?\" ... When it happens when the spring comes -- the birds know how to sing. In fact, there is no \"how\" to it. The very presence of the spring, and the birds are thrilled. Something goes berserk in their hearts. Something simply starts pulsating their being, something simply starts singing in their being. It is not that they sing. It is spring that sings in them. It is satori, it is SAMADHI, that is expressed by you. It is not a question of YOU expressing it.\nThat's why the Master says, \"It cannot be expressed through words, and it cannot be expressed through silence.\" The very question that can be expressed through words is foolish, the very question that can be expressed through silence is foolish, because nobody knows --\nwhen the spring comes the cuckoo will sing in its own way, and the parrots will fly in their own way, and there will be a thousand and one songs, different, unique.\nThe cuckoo cannot screech the way parrots do, and the parrots cannot imitate the cuckoos.\nAnd there is no need. The cuckoo is beautiful, so is the parrot.\nWhen satori has happened, nobody knows. Meera dances; Buddha never danced. The cuckoo and the parrot ...\nListen ...\nChaitanya sang, took his drum and danced all over Bengal. Mahavir remained in silence, never spoke a single word. Now, you will be puzzled. Then how do the Jaina sutras exist?\nHow? It is a beautiful story.\nJainas say Mahavir never spoke, but those who were able to hear him, they heard, and they have collected the sayings. Listen again; you may have missed: Jainas say Mahavir never spoke, but those who could hear, they heard. In his silent presence they heard what he was saying, and they collected the sayings. The Jaina sutras start always, \"We have heard.\" They don't start, \"Mahavir said,\" no. The disciples say, \"We have heard. That's true, on our part, we have heard. We don't know whether he has said it or not, but in a certain moment we heard it.\nA voiceless voice, a soundless sound.\"\nYes, a cuckoo is a cuckoo, a parrot is a parrot, and both are needed. If the world is only for cuckoos it will be ugly. Too many cuckoos, it will not be good. Existence needs variety, and existence is rich because of variety. Yes, it is good sometimes a Mahavir keeps silent, and it is good sometimes a Meera goes mad, dancing. It is good to have a Christ and a Krishna. It is good to have a\nZarathustra and a Mohammed and a Lao Tzu. All are so different and so unique, and yet the message is the same.\nThose who have eyes to see, they will see the same truth being expressed in millions of forms. And those who have ears to hear, they will hear the same song, sung in so many different languages.\nOsho - The First Principle 123\nChapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence\nIt is the same rose; whether you call it \"rose\" or GULAB does not make any difference. In India we call it GULAB, in the West you call it \"rose\". Sometimes we can even quarrel and argue \"What is it -- GULAB or rose?\"\nZen Masters say, \"Don't quarrel, please. Bring a GULAB or a rose, whatsoever you call it.\nBring it here. Make it immediate, and then look.\" And then the quarrel ceases because when somebody brings a rose you will see -- and he call it GULAB -- you will understand; you will say, \"Okay, that's okay. Call it whatsoever you want to call it. It is the same thing I have been calling rose and you call GULAB, and we have been quarreling.\"\nScholars quarrel, argue. Masters look at the thing called rose or GULAB, or there can be a thousand names -- there are so many languages, each language has a different name for it.\nEach person who attains to SAMADHI gives expression in his own way. But the question is: Has the spring come?\nSo the Master says, \"IN SOUTHERN CHINA, IN THE SPRING, WHEN I WAS ONLY\nA LAD, AH! HOW THE BIRDS SANG AMONG THE BLOSSOMS.\" The\nsecond thing he says, \"When I was only a boy when my eyes were innocent, when I was young and fresh and virgin, when I was not corrupted by the society, when I was uncorrupted, when my freshness had not gathered any dust of\nknowledge, experience -- THEN. \"\n\"... IN THE SPRING, WHEN I WAS ONLY A LAD, AH! HOW THE BIRDS SANG\nAMONG THE BLOSSOMS.\" There were a great many flowers and a great many birds, and singing, the same song, the same spring, the same youth, the same life juice. What he is saying is, \"Please, let the spring come first, and don't be worried about how it can be said neither in words nor in silence.\"\nIt can be said both in words and in silence. In fact, whenever it is said, there is word and silence together. But the word is not a mere word; that's why they say it cannot be said through words. And the silence is not a dead silence, it is not the silence of the cemetery; that's why the Master says it cannot be said through silence, either. The word is not of the pundit, and the silence is not of the dead man; but there is a great marriage between word and silence.\nThe word speaks through silence, the silence speaks through the word; and when silence and word meet there is song. Then there is celebration.\nWhen the spring has come there is celebration. When the SAMADHI has happened there is celebration. In that celebration it is expressed, and it is expressed abundantly. In that celebration, in that blossoming, it is expressed. But it is expressed only for those who can understand, who can see, who can feel, who can love.\nOsho - The First Principle 124\nChapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial 8\nThe Profound and the Trivial\n18 April 1977 am in Buddha Hall Question\nMY EXPERIENCE OF ME IS THE MOST PROFOUND EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.\nIT IS ALSO THE MOST TRIVIAL. PLEASE CLARIFY.\nThe question is from Dhruva, and the question is really significant. The question has arisen out of an insight, almost a mini-satori.\nThat's how life is, profound and trivial at the same time, simultaneously. There is no contradiction, Dhruva, in the profundity of life and its trivialness. You have been taught that the sacred is far away and it is never the profane. You have been taught a distinction between the profane and the sacred, between the profound and the trivial. In fact, there is no distinction. The trivial is the profound, the ordinary is the extraordinary, and the temporal is the eternal.\nSo this is a great insight. Don't lose sight of it. More possibility is there that you will lose it, because it will go against the grain. Your whole training has been such that you are always dividing: into good and bad, into the pure and the impure, the perfect and the imperfect, into virtue and sin, the holy and the unholy. You have always been making these distinctions, and because of distinctions you have missed the reality of that which is.\nThis cuckoo singing there and Christ speaking to you are not different. A leaf falling from the tree and a word falling from the lips of Buddha are not different. The very dust is divine.\nThe distinction is man-made, it is a mind trick.\nAnd because of these distinctions, these categories, we are never together, we cannot be together. How can you be together if you make such an unbridgeable gap between the profound and the trivial? Then you will find your whole life is trivial. Eating, drinking, sleeping, walking, going to the office or to the farm -- all is trivia.\nThen where will you find the profound? In the church, in the temple, sometimes praying and meditating, sometimes listening to me? Then the profound will not be much in your life, and the profound will be, in a way, false. It will not permeate your whole life. It will not be there always with you. It will not surround you like a climate. Sometimes you will have to make an effort to have that quality of profundity, and again and again you will lose it. And you will\nbecome divided, schizophrenic; you will become two, split, and you will start condemning yourself.\nWhenever you will see something trivial you will condemn yourself, that \"I am just trivial, ordinary.\" And whenever you will see something profound you will start feeling holier than thou; you will start feeling very egoistic. Both are dangerous.\nTo feel that you are trivial is a condemnation. It creates an inferiority complex. It pulls you down into sadness. It forces you to remain depressed. And, naturally, you cannot love Osho - The First Principle\n125\nChapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial\nyourself: you are so trivial. You are so ordinary, how can you love yourself? You fall too short from the ideal of perfection. So a great condemnation arises in your being, and the moment you condemn yourself you are in hell. Then nobody can take you out of it. Even if somebody comes and says you are beautiful, you will not trust him. You will think he is trying to cheat you, bribe you. He is trying to exploit you. How can you be beautiful? You know yourself better than he knows you. You are not beautiful; you are ugly. You are the ugliest person in the world.\nBecause of this condemnation, love will not happen. How can you love anybody if you are feeling so condemned in yourself? And how can you allow somebody to love you if you are feeling so condemned? Love is impossible. When you live in self-condemnation you live in hell. Hell is not somewhere else: it is in your attitude; it is a condemning attitude.\nWhen you accept yourself and you enjoy yourself, you are in heaven. Heaven is also an attitude.\nAnd you can move from heaven and hell any moment you decide! And you go on moving; you swing between heaven and hell. Just understand that it is your creation.\nSo if you feel condemned because of your trivia, you will be in hell. And then sometimes you will start feeling very holy because you have done something great. You have saved a life\n-- somebody was drowning in the ocean and you saved him, and a child was caught in a house on fire and you jumped in and you risked your life, you have done something great -- then you will feel very egoistic. Ego is again hell.\nTo feel superior is to be in hell, to feel inferior is to be in hell. To drop all superiority, inferiority, and just to be is to be in heaven.\nThe idea of condemnation is also ego-oriented. People have impossible ideals. Just the other night Vishnu came; he writes again and again that \"I am not perfect. What should I do?\"\nthat \"I am imperfect,\" that \"Whatsoever I do is imperfect.\" He is torturing himself because he is imperfect. But who is not imperfect? The very idea that \"I should be perfect,\" is very egoistic. The very effort is egoistic. Nobody is perfect.\nIn fact, perfection cannot exist, by its very nature. To be perfect means to be dead. Then there will be no evolution, when you are perfect. Then how can you survive? For what? If God is perfect then God is dead. If God is imperfect only then is he alive and can be alive.\nI preach the imperfect God, and I preach the imperfect existence, and I preach the beauty of imperfection and the life of imperfection. The very idea that \"I have to be perfect,\" that \"No flaw should be there in my life\" is egoistic. And certainly you will find a thousand and one flaws.\nSo on one hand you are on an ego trip, which creates trouble, makes you miserable, because you are not perfect; and on the other hand the same trip creates condemnation. You want to be superior and you know that you are inferior: both are two aspects of the same coin.\nYou remain in hell.\nEnjoy your imperfection. Enjoy the way you are.\nAnd drop all distinctions between the holy and the unholy, sin and virtue, good and bad, God and devil. Destroy all those distinctions. Those are the traps you are caught in. Those are the traps which don't allow you to live, don't allow you freedom. You cannot dance: one foot Osho - The First Principle\n126\nChapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial\nis encaged in inferiority, another foot is encaged in superiority. You are chained. How can you dance? Drop all these chains.\nThat's what Zen people say: \"A hair's distinction, and heaven and hell are set apart.\" That's what Tilopa says. A little distinction, a hair's distinction, and hell and heaven are set apart, and you are caught in the duality. No distinction, and you are free. No distinction, is freedom.\nThe profundity of the trivial and the trivialness of the profound, that's what I teach.\nEating is trivial if you look from the outside. If you look from the inside it is profound, it is a miracle -- that you can eat bread and the bread is turned into blood, that it becomes your flesh, that it becomes your bones, that it even becomes your marrow. You eat bread, and the bread becomes your thoughts, dreams. It is a miracle. It is the profoundest thing that is happening. When you are eating, it is no ordinary thing. God is at work. It is creative. While chewing bread you are creating life, unknowingly, unconsciously. You are making a thousand and one things possible. Tomorrow you may paint: and that bread that you had eaten has become painting. Tomorrow you may sing, or right now you may do something which would not be possible if the bread was not there.\nThe Christian prayer is beautiful; it says, \"God, give us our daily bread.\" Looks very trivial! What does Jesus mean when he says, \"Pray every day, 'Give us our daily bread'\"?\nCouldn't he think of anything more profound? Bread? You just change the word \"bread\" and say every day in your prayer, \"Lord, give us our daily tea,\" and you will see how foolish it looks. But the bread or tea or coffee -- or Coca-Cola! ... yes, Coca-Cola too is divine.\nEverything is divine -- because how can it be otherwise?\nThe prayer says, \"Give us our daily bread.\" It is raising the trivial to the profound. It is a great statement. The Hindus have always been saying, \"ANNAM BRAHMA\" -- \"Food is God.\" Raising the trivial to the profound.\nLooking into the trivial so deeply that it changes into the profound.\nYou are taking a shower. It is trivia, everyday business, but it can become profound. Just look deep into it. Just standing under the shower, and the water goes on flowing, and the body feels fresh and young and alive, and the water is a blessing. Because we are made out of water. A man is almost eighty percent water, and the first glimpse of life happened in the sea.\nThe first thing that existed was the fish, and even now, in the mother's womb, the child floats in seawater, with almost the same ingredients, the same saltiness. That's why when a woman is pregnant she starts eating more salt; she needs more salt because the child needs seawater around him. The child is still a fish in the beginning, primary stage. Water is life, and when you are taking a shower life is showering on you -- eighty percent of life is showering on you, the most necessary element for life. No life is possible without water. These trees will not be there if the water is not, and these birds won't sing, and these animals won't be there and these men will not be there. All life will disappear if water disappears.\nThere is a profound experience when you are touched by water. You can make it so profound! It depends on you, how you go into it. It can become a meditation, a prayer. You can feel grateful, that God is great, that water is still available.\nTo breathe is so trivial, who bothers about it? But breath is your life. All languages have words for \"life\" which really mean \"breath\". Sanskrit has PRANA for \"life\"; it means\n\"breath\". The word \"soul\" means \"breath\"; the word \"psyche\" means \"breath\". Osho - The First Principle\n127\nChapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial\nAnd the Bible says God made man and breathed life into him. Life started by breathing into man; otherwise man was just dust. \"Adam\" means \"dust,\" \"earth\". God made Adam out of mud. \"Adam\" is the Hebrew word for \"earth\". Then he breathed life into him. And that's how life happens always. A child is born and the first thing we wait expectantly for is that he should cry. Why? Because only\nthrough crying will he start breathing. For two, three seconds even the doctor cannot breathe, the nurse cannot breathe. Whether the child is going to breathe or not, who knows? He may not breathe. If he is not going to breathe then there will be no life.\nIf he breathes there will be life. Still the same happens as it happens with Adam: God breathes in the child, in each child.\nGod is the invisible force, the life energy that surrounds you. It enters through breath in you, and the day you die you will die through exhalation. You start life with inhalation, you stop life with exhalation; then you will not breathe anymore. Again Adam is adam, again dust is dust, dust unto dust.\nBreath is life, but have you looked into it? Standing under the sun in the morning, breathe.\nIt is God you breathe in. And then it becomes profound. It is your attitude.\nThe trivial and the profound are not two separate things. They are one, they are together, they are two aspects of one energy. Your life is trivia if you don't look deep. If you start looking deep your life is profound.\nSo Dhruva, it is a great insight. You say, \"My experience of me is the most profound experience of my life. It is also the most trivial. Please clarify.\" Don't get confused. There is nothing to clarify. It is how life is: the trivial is the profound.\nThe question has arisen because Dhruva must have been thinking these are contradictions, the trivial and the profound. No, they are not contradictory; they are complementary. The trivial hides the profound. The trivial functions like a cover, like a crust; it protects the profound. It is almost like a seed. The seed is protecting the possibility of the tree. That possibility is very soft; the seed is hard. The hard seed, the hard crust of the seed, is protecting the softest possibility, of flowers, of a big tree. And the seed will protect it till the seed finds the right soil. Then the seed disappears, then the sheath disappears, then the hard crust dissolves into the earth and the soft life arises.\nThe profound is hidden in the trivial, so look deep. Wherever there is the trivial there is the profound. Don't escape from the trivial; otherwise you will be escaping from the profound.\nAnd don't seek the profound AGAINST the trivial; otherwise you will never find it.\nQuestion\nA PLAY QUESTION: IF YOU WERE TO COME HERE NOW TO THIS ASHRAM AS\nA YOUNG UNENLIGHTENED MAN, HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND? WOULD YOU\nBECOME PART OF THE ASHRAM? WHAT WORK WOULD YOU DO? WHERE\nWOULD YOU SIT?\nThe question is from Somendra. A beautiful question.\nFirst, he asks, \"If you were to come here now to this ashram as a young unenlightened man, how would you respond?\nOsho - The First Principle 128\nChapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial\nEven if I was unenlightened I would not be so unenlightened to come to this ashram. That much is certain.\nMulla Nasrudin's wife was dying, and of course he was consoling her in every way, and the wife opened her eyes and said, \"It seems almost certain that this night will be my last. I will not be able to see the sunrise again. Mulla, how will you react to my death?\"\nThe Mulla said, \"How will I react to your death? I will go mad!\"\nEven in that serious moment the wife started laughing: she said, \"You cunning fellow.\nYou will not go mad. I know within a week you will be remarried.\"\nAnd Mulla said, \"No. I will go mad -- but I will not go THAT mad.\" So even if I was unenlightened I would not be THAT unenlightened. Second thing, you say, \"Would you become part of the ashram?\"\nEven now I am not part of the ashram. I cannot be part of any institution or any organization, even my own. And if I had come as an unenlightened man, naturally, the ashram will not be mine, will be somebody else's. I cannot be a part even of my own organization, so how can I be a part of anybody else's organization? Impossible.\nAnd then you ask, \"What work would you do?\"\nI have never done any work. I am the laziest man in the world you can find. And the last, you ask, \"Where would you sit?\"\nI would escape immediately! I would see some organization, some ashram and I would run! You are asking, \"Where will you sit?\" I will not sit at all.\nQuestion\nUSUALLY I AM \"THIS WAY\" OR \"THAT WAY\". BUT FOR SOME TIME I HAVE\nEXPERIENCED ALL KINDS OF CONTRADICTIONS, SIMULTANEOUSLY. I SEE\nWOMEN AS OBJECTS OF WORSHIP, AND AT THE SAME TIME I LUST AFTER\nTHEM. I AM CONTENT TO LET LIFE FLOW, AND I AM AFRAID OF THE FUTURE. I CRAVE TO BE ALONE, AND I CRAVE TO BE ALWAYS WITH PEOPLE. I FEEL\nBIZARRE BECAUSE THESE CONTRADICTIONS ALL SEEM EQUALLY REAL AND\nTRUE. IS THERE ANYTHING TO BE UNDERSTOOD OR DONE ABOUT\nTHIS?\nWhenever you come across a contradiction, watch very carefully. There is bound to be something of great significance. Never avoid contradictions, because life is contradictory. Life exists through the tension of contradiction. So whenever you come across a contradiction you are very close to the source of life. Let that be always remembered.\nThe ordinary reaction is whenever you come across a contradiction you start trying to solve it, start finding explanations for it, or start dropping it into the unconscious so you need not worry about it. You start doing something about it immediately the moment you feel some contradiction because you have been taught to live noncontradictorily. You have been taught a Osho - The First Principle\n129\nChapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial\nvery dangerous thing. Nobody can live noncontradictorily. If you want to live you have to live through contradiction, AS contradiction.\nYou have been taught to be consistent; that's why you have become false. This is the whole trick. How does such great hypocrisy exist in the world? Why? Why has the whole world turned out to be hypocritical? There is a trick to it, a great trick; a great technology is behind it. The technology is: teach people to be consistent, and they will become hypocrites.\nBecause life exists through contradiction.\nLife is inconsistent. One moment this, another moment that; life is that way. One moment you are feeling loving, another moment you hate the same person; life is like that. Now, you have been taught if you love, then love always. What happens? You cannot love always, so only one thing is possible: when hate comes you hide the hate, you repress the hate, and you go on pretending love. This is what hypocrisy is. When you don't love you pretend.\nYou are full of hate for your wife, but you come home and you hug her and you kiss her and you inquire, \"How are you, honey?\" and all that. And deep down you are hating her and you want to kill her. In fact, the whole day you have been\nfantasizing how to kill this woman.\nBut you have been taught to be consistent. So, once, you had fallen in love, and you have said things in those love moments and you have promised that \"I will love you forever and ever\" --\nnow you have to be consistent.\nWhat will you do with your hate that is bound to arise? Each love object is bound to be the hate object too. If you want not to hate, then you will have to stop loving. If you really want not to hate anybody, then you will have to stop loving, but you cannot love consistently. The inconsistency will come up again and again.\nIt is as if somebody has told you, \"If you see the day, don't see the night. That is inconsistent.\" So what will you do? In the day you keep your eyes open, in the night you keep your eyes closed and believe that it is day. But the night comes; it doesn't follow your ideas. It has to come. The night follows the day; the day follows the night.\nYou have been taught, \"Be consistent.\" Your so-called character is nothing but an effort to be consistent.\nA real man cannot have any character. A real man is bound to be characterless because to have a character means to have consistency. To be characterless means to be free.\nI said something yesterday. Now, if I have a character, I will try to be consistent with my past; whatsoever I said yesterday, I have to say the same thing today. But then I have to repeat my past. I cannot live in the moment and I cannot live in the present.\nIn fact, a consistent man is one who goes on changing his past into his future, who goes on putting his past as his future, ahead of himself. That is the man of character, consistent man.\nAn inconsistent man is one who never allows the past to become his future, who remains free for the future, who has no promises to keep, who has no commitment with the past. Whenever it was, he lived it totally; gone, it is gone.\nA real man will love you and will hate you too. And sometimes he will say, \"I will love you always\"; and sometimes he will say, \"I cannot love you again. Impossible.\" Sometimes he will be in a deep honeymoon with you and sometimes in a deep divorce, and both things will go like day and night. A real marriage is a continuous honeymoon and divorce, and honeymoon and divorce. Mini honeymoons, mini divorces; big honeymoons, big divorces. It continues like day and night.\nOsho - The First Principle 130\nChapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial\nSo whenever you come across a contradiction, be watchful, be very alert. You are very close to life. And when you are consistent you are just false, a plastic thing, you are not real.\nI don't teach consistency. I teach the freedom of being inconsistent. I teach the freedom of being contradictory. That's my whole approach towards life.\nOf course, you are afraid of being contradictory because then you will not know who you are. With character there is something, something very secure: you know who you are. You have a label: a good man, a bad man, a saint, a sinner. You can believe in your identity when you are consistent -- that you are a good husband, a good Christian, a churchgoer, and this and that. With the inconsistency your identity disappears; you don't know who you are. You become an opening, you are no more closed, you have an open future. You don't know what you are going to do the next moment; only the next moment will tell. To live in that insecurity needs courage.\nSannyas is what I propose. Sannyas means to remain in insecurity; sannyas means not to allow your past to influence your future, not to allow your past to project itself into the future.\nLet the dead bury the dead. The past is gone, gone. Don't cling to it, and don't help it to cling to you.\nThe moment something has passed it has passed. Be completely clean of it and be free and fresh again; then you will be real, authentically real, and there will be\njoy, and there will be celebration and song. I am not saying you will not ever be sad, no. You will be sad. The false man is never sad -- because he is never happy. The false man just remains in the middle, never happy, never sad. He is simply so-so, lukewarm; he is never too cold and never too hot. He is just \"okay\". He somehow manages. He has a comfortable life, but no real life.\nI am not saying that the real man will always be happy. I am saying the real man will always be real. When he is sad he will be really sad. He will sing a song -- of sadness. He will accept his sadness as part of life, as part of growth. He will not reject it. If he feels like crying he will cry; he will not say, \"What am I doing? This is not good. Only women cry, and I am a man.\" He will not say that. He will say, \"If my eyes want to cry and the tears are rolling down, good. I have to be real. I am only whatsoever I am.\" He will cry. His tears will be true.\nYour smiles are false, your tears are false. You manage to smile, and you manage to cry too. So you live an empty life. The real man's life will be full, sometimes full of joy and sometimes full of sadness.\nAnd the real man one day becomes enlightened. The unreal man never becomes enlightened. When the real man becomes enlightened, then there is no joy and no sadness.\nThen his being is just a witness. Joy comes: he watches it. Sadness comes: he watches it.\nNow, these are the three stages. The false man: his joy is just a show, a mask, his sadness too; he pretends. The real man, the second stage: he is natural, spontaneous; his joy is true, his sadness is true. You can trust him. When he is crying, his whole heart is crying; and when he smiles, his whole heart is smiling. And the second stage is a must to attain to the third, the enlightened man. The enlightened man is neither sad nor happy. He has attained to the witnessing soul; he simply watches. He knows the sadness has come, the happiness has come, but these are like climates that come and go and change, and he remains centered.\nThe false man cannot jump to the enlightened state; hence I teach the real man, but the real man is not the goal.\nOsho - The First Principle 131\nChapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial\nThat's why my work goes beyond the Encounter ideology, Gestalt ideology. The Gestalt ideology or the Encounter ideology stops at the real man. Good. Better than the unreal. But not enough. Something has yet to happen. I use Encounter groups, Gestalt groups, and all the therapies that have become available in the West. They are perfectly beautiful; they bring you from the first, false state to the authentic, real state. But my work goes beyond them. But I can go beyond only if you have gone through the second stage. From the first there is no way, from the false there is no way, to enlightenment; only from the real is there a way.\nYou will have to go through the ecstasy of the real and the agony of the real. When you have lived deeply all the realities of life, the witness will arise. It arises naturally, out of being real.\nSo you say, \"Usually I am 'this way' or 'that way'.\" That is not a good way. You get fixed with one thing, this way or that. Become more fluid, remain more fluid, because life is not solid; it is fluid, it is flow. And that's what is happening and is confusing you.\n\"But for some time I have experienced all kinds of contradictions, simultaneously.\" Good.\nYou are blessed. This confusion is the beginning of a great journey, a great pilgrimage. If you become afraid you will go back to the false.\nThe false is secure. Let me remind you again and again: the false is comfortable. A good way to die is the false, but not a good way to live. Even your death will be false, because how can the death be real? When you have not lived really, how can you die really?\nSo many people die, but rarely does a real death happen. When a Buddha dies it is a real death, or when Lin Chi dies it is a real death. There are very few deaths which are real, because there are very few lives which are real. You only pretend to live, and then one day you pretend to die.\nI have heard, a man met an old friend on the road, and the old friend was a very, very fanatical Christian Scientist. The old friend asked this man, \"How is your father now?\" and the man said, \"He is very ill.\" The Christian Scientist, of course, to be consistent with his philosophy, said, \"He is not ill. He only thinks\nhe is ill.\"\nThat is the Christian Scientists' ideology, that you only think that you are ill, that's why you are ill. You are not really ill. He said, \"He only thinks he is ill. He is not really ill.\"\nAfter eight days, these two men met again, and the Christian Scientist asked again, \"How is your father now?\"\nAnd the young man hesitated a little, and then he said, \"Now he thinks he is dead.\" -- to be consistent with this old man's ideology.\nThe father has died, but this is a reality.\nYou go on living in a fantasy world. Your life is nothing but your thinking, a pseudo thing; and so is your death. Your illness, your health, your happiness, your sadness are all so bogus that how can you die a real death? A real death has to be earned. One has to become worthy of real death. And one becomes worthy only by living truly.\nNow you are very close to a great source of light. That's why you are feeling all sorts of contradictions simultaneously. That means your solidity is melting. Your hate and love are not categorized as two anymore. They are not put into boxes separately anymore; they are merging with each other. The profound and the trivial are coming together, and you are confused because now you cannot label what is what.\nOsho - The First Principle 132\nChapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial\n\"I have experienced all kinds of contradictions, simultaneously. I see women as objects of worship, and at the same time I lust after them.\" That's what has happened down the ages.\nThere are two things man has done with woman: either he has worshiped woman as a goddess or he has condemned woman as a witch. Either he has exploited the woman for his lust or he has touched her feet and said, \"You are divine. Divine\nmother.\" Either the woman has been a prostitute or a divine mother. Man has not accepted woman just as human.\nAnd woman is human, as human as you are. She is neither a divine mother nor is she a prostitute, but that's how the mind goes on. The mind makes things different, separate, puts them in categories. You have killed the real woman, because the real woman is both, the prostitute and the divine mother, together, simultaneously. If you fall in love with a prostitute you will find a divine mother. Even a prostitute will turn into a divine mother if you are in love with her; you will not find the prostitute. And fall in love with a divine mother and you will find the prostitute too.\nWhat I am saying is that life is not so small as to be put into boxes -- that this is a prostitute and this is a divine mother. Life is vast, so big. It contains contradictions. And that is the beauty of life and that is the richness of life.\nMan has been changing between these polarities. Sometimes he calls the woman the divine mother. That too is inhuman, because then you put the woman on a pedestal and you don't allow her to be human. Watch. When you force a woman to be a divine mother, what are you doing? You are not allowing her to be human. And she will pretend that she is a divine mother, so if you want to make love to her she will be reluctantly ready. She will say no, and she will mean yes. She has to say no; she is the divine mother.\nA good woman has to be a dead woman. Even while you are making love, she will lie down there like a corpse. A slight movement, and you will become afraid: so are you wrong, she is not so good, not so virtuous? If she starts enjoying your lovemaking, you will think that she is a bad woman. Only bad women enjoy lovemaking, not good women. Good women?\nThey don't think of sex at all.\nLook at the trick. You put the woman so high; then you don't allow her to be human. You have made her \"superhuman\". That is a way to make her inhuman. Or you force her to be a prostitute; that is again a way, to put her below the human, to make her again inhuman. Then you go to the prostitute, you give her the money, you make love to her -- with no responsibility, with no love. It is simple, pure lust, but you know that that woman is a bad woman. How can you love her? You feel good, there is no problem. You can lust after this woman and\nyou can use her as a thing. She is just a prostitute, not a human being; you don't relate to her. You just go and do things to her, pay the price, and you are finished. Next day in the marketplace, you will not even recognize her.\nIn both these ways you have turned the woman into inhuman beings. Both are ugly.\nThe woman is both: the divine mother and the prostitute. Just as you are both: God and animal.\nLet me repeat: the profane is the sacred, the samsara is the nirvana.\nThrough these categories ... The reality is so complex and so deep it cannot be categorized, it cannot be demarked into definitions. No woman is just a prostitute and no woman is just a divine mother. And that is true about man, the same way. Once you see this, you are freed from categories, logical boxes, pigeonholes, and you can see reality as it is.\nOsho - The First Principle 133\nChapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial\nA woman is a human being, as you are a human being. Yes sometimes she is a witch; just as sometimes you are mean, ugly, horrible, she is too. And sometimes she is ecstasy, pure ecstasy. Sometimes she is the most beautiful phenomenon on the earth, just as you are.\nIn India we have the right representation, the symbol of Kali. You must have seen the pictures of Kali or the statues of Kali. That is really a great understanding about women. Kali is painted as black, as black as the devil -- \"kali\" means \"black\" -- and yet she is the divine mother. And she is most beautiful. She is black, as black as the devil, but her form is that of the divine. She has a beautiful face, a beautiful body, absolutely in proportion; but she is black. And then, she is dancing on the chest of her husband, almost killing him. Shiva is her husband, and she is dancing on his chest and almost killing him. And she loves him too. She loves and kills together. All contradictions put together.\nThe mother gives you birth, the woman gives you birth, and by and by the woman kills you too. She brings your death closer; hence the attraction and the fear. You are attracted with the divine, and you are afraid with the devilish.\nSo you say, \"I see women as objects of worship, and at the same time I lust after them.\"\nBoth are complementaries. Accept them. That's how reality is. The woman is both, and you are both. And if you accept this contradictory reality, one day you will go beyond it, you will transcend it.\nThere is a transcendental element too, but that transcendental element can be understood only when you pass through contradictions. If you avoid contradictions you will never attain the transcendental. Go through the contradictory, and by and by you will become just a witness to them both.\nHow does it work? It works in a simple way. If you think you are good, you are identified with good. If you think you are bad, you are identified with the bad. But if you allow both good and bad together, you cannot get identified with either. You remain unidentified, and that is the fundamental, the radical change. You remain unidentified. You cannot figure out who you are, good or bad, day or night, life or death, beautiful or ugly. You cannot identify with anything, so you remain unidentified.\nGood comes and passes, and you know you cannot be good, because the bad is coming.\nAnd the bad comes and passes, and you know you cannot be the bad. either, because the good is coming. So you cannot be good and you cannot be bad; then who are you? You are a witness. a witness who watches everything come and go, a watcher on the hills.\n\"I am content to let life flow, and I am afraid of the future.\" The same. The same contradiction on so many levels.\n\"I crave to be alone, and I crave to be always with people.\" The same.\n\"I feel bizarre because these contradictions all seem equally real and true.\" They are. And when for the first time you recognize that they are true and real, one feels bizarre. That's what the Zen people say: first the rivers are rivers and the\nmountain are mountains, then the rivers are no more rivers and the mountains are no more mountains -- bizarre, confusion, clouds, everything topsy-turvy, all disturbed -- and then one day mountains are again mountains and rivers are again rivers, everything settled again, on a higher plane of course, on the transcendental plane of course.\nYou will have to go through this bizarreness. To be sane one has to pass through many insanities.\nOsho - The First Principle 134\nChapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial\n\"Is there anything to be understood or done about this?\" Just understood, nothing to be done about it. I don't teach doing. Nothing has to be done. You just watch. Watch more and more carefully, watch in detail. Watch the subtlest nuance of any change in you. Watch all --\nwhich no prejudice, with no judgement. And that watching will integrate you, will make you more and more aware.\nAnd that is the whole purpose of life: to create more intelligence, to create more awareness.\nQuestion\nIS THERE ANYTHING I CAN GIVE YOU BACK?\nNothing, because that is what I give to you. I give you nothing, and only nothing can you give me back.\nIn fact, don't start thinking of giving me anything back, because I am not giving you anything. I am simply making you aware of things that you already have. You don't owe anything to me, not even a thank-you. If you thank me, that is simply generous of you, you are just being polite and gentlemanly; otherwise there is nothing. You don't owe anything to me. I have not given anything to you and I am not going to give anything to you, and nothing can be given, in the very nature of things.\nIn fact, if you are not angry at me, I will be happy enough. Because I take away many things. I don't give anything to you. I take away your ego, and I don't give anything instead. I take away a thousand and one things. And when those thousand and one things have been taken away, suddenly you become aware of that which has always been there from the very beginning.\nSo let me say it in this way: I give you that which you already have, and I take away things which you don't have but you think you have. I take away that which is not there but you believe is there. I take away your illusions.\nBut I cannot give reality. Reality is that which cannot be given; it is already there. I eliminate the illusion, and the reality is there. I simply give you back to yourself.\nThere is no need to be worried -- \"Is there anything I can give you back.?\" Just if you are not angry, that will be enough. If you can forgive me, that will be enough.\nI know it is very difficult to forgive me. That is the greatest danger a Master takes on his shoulders. It is very difficult for the disciples to forgive him, and they are always watching from the corner of their eyes to find some fault. They are always waiting to find some loophole so they can jump upon it and they can say, \"So, I have found the reality. This man is nothing,\" and they can go and condemn. It is a very dangerous game.\nThe disciples are continuously watchful. They are like spies, spying on the Master, if they can find something.\nJust the other question-answer day, when I talked about Dr. Kovoor, two, three persons got almost mad about me. They have written letters that \"Why did you do this? It is cheap!\" And I go on telling you the cheap is the costly! And the trivial is the profound! And the world, the samsara, is nirvana! Do you hear me, or not? And they have demanded, almost it is a demand, Osho - The First Principle\n135\nChapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial\nthat \"You have to answer it, why you attacked him.\" I have not attacked him; I\nhave attacked these three people who have written to me. What have I to do with Kovoor? He is not going to come here, I am not going to go there. We are not going to meet anyway. I have attacked these three persons, and I have got them, trapped them, they are trapped. I have attacked their idea of me.\nOne has written, \"It is inconceivable that a man of your height should come so low.\" But who in the first place has told you that I am a man of height? You yourself project, and if your projections are destroyed, you are angry at me?\nI go on repeating, just to be safe, that I am a very ordinary man. Otherwise you will hang me in the sky. You will say, \"You are so high.\"\nIf you find me eating or if you find me taking a bath ... Do you know? In heaven there is no provision for God's bathroom. No provision. I have gone through all the scriptures.\nCan you believe God farts? Impossible. So high, and farting? Belching? These things are good for human beings, not for gods.\nWho has told you I am so high? But you project.\nAnd I am not so foolish as to accept your projections. If you want to project such things, you will have to find some other people. You are not allowed to project anything on me. I will go on throwing it. I am not here to fulfill any of your expectations. That is the very trouble you have to tolerate with me. You would like me to be dead and sitting on a golden throne, and then you can worship me easily. But I am alive.\nAnd I go on doing things that I like. I don't care what you think. If you are disturbed it is your problem; it is none of my business. Then you have to look into yourself and find ways not to be disturbed.\nThese things come again and again in your mind, and you don't see that they are YOUR\nproblems.\nSomebody else has asked, \"Why do we have to pay money here?\" \"I have no money,\" he says, \"and I want to be here.\" But then who is going to pay for you? You will need money, you will need food, you will need a shelter, you will need\nclothes, sometimes you will be ill, you will need the hospital: who is going to pay for you? Now, he thinks that this ashram is money obsessed. If people who don't have money are allowed, then Laxmi will have to go even more money obsessed because for them also she will have to arrange. Just to avoid money obsession, money has to be arranged. There are many people who would like to be here, but then who is going to arrange for them? And if somebody else arranges for them, he will demand something in return.\nThe person says, \"Even Christians don't ask for money; even they are not that bold.\" I know they are not that bold. They need not be; they have enough money. The Vatican has enough money; that is the richest party in the world. But then you have to pay -- not in money, money is there -- you have to pay with other things: you have to pay with your freedom.\nHere I want you to be free. I don't want to hinder your freedom.\nIf you want to stay here without money, then I will have to ask some people who have money to give money to the ashram. But then they have their conditions. Then their conditions have to be fulfilled. Otherwise why should they give their money? They give money in return for something. Then you will not be free here. And I will not be free here. I will not be able to Osho - The First Principle\n136\nChapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial\nsay what I want to say. Then they will dictate to me that this has to be said and this has not to be said.\nNobody is money obsessed. But the questioner is money obsessed: he has no money and he wants to be here. But what is money? Money is just that you have to pay for everything.\nYou eat: you have to pay for it. You live: you have to pay for it. You need clothes: you have to pay for it.\nAnd why should you not pay? Then somebody else will have to pay for you. Why exploit somebody else?\nIf you don't have money, then go and earn money and come back. YOU are\nmoney obsessed! But you think that Bhagwan is demanding money. It is your problem.\nSomebody has said, \"I can't see the point why I have to pay when I come to the lecture.\nWhen I have to pay ten rupees for the lecture, then I cannot think of you as God.\" So the price of thinking of me as God is ten rupees! If he does not have to pay, he will think of me as God.\nWhat do you think? You are trying to bribe me? Pay twenty rupees and think of me as the devil, perfectly okay!\nWhy should you not pay? Why should you like to exploit?\nAnd this is my understanding, that you hear only when you pay; otherwise you don't hear.\nWhen you have nothing to pay, there is no need to hear. The more you pay, the more alert you are -- because those ten rupees are gone. If you don't listen it is your business; you remain a little alert. J know you are money-minded; those ten rupees will keep you awake.\nAnd my godhood is not in danger, because I don't care what you think about me. That is not the point at all. It is not that you have made me a god. This is my declaration; it is not your recognition. If nobody believes in me, then too I am a god. If only I believe in me, that's enough. I don't need a single witness. This is MY understanding.\nThen again, the moment you think that this man is Bhagwan, then he should behave in such a way and in such a way. Then he should be on a high pedestal. He should not behave like a human being.\nThen you don't understand my concept of Bhagwan. My concept of Bhagwan is not that a Bhagwan is a special being, that a Bhagwan is a perfect being, that a Bhagwan is not of this world. My concept of Bhagwan is that God is a normal quality of existence. Just by being, you are God.\nYou are not a painter by just being. For painting, you will have to learn some skill, you will have to go to an art school. And then too your being a painter will\ndepend on so many recognitions -- people will recognize, may not recognize; the critics will appreciate, may not appreciate; a thousand and one things. If you want to be a musician, just by being, you are not a musician. You will have to learn; this is something which has to be learned.\nWhen I say God, I mean you ARE God, just by being. It is not a specialization.\nThen what is the difference between me and you? The only difference is that I recognize my godhood and you don't recognize yours. Otherwise there is no distinction. I am as imperfect as you are! Then what is the difference between me and you? The difference is that I enjoy my imperfection and you don't enjoy yours, that I am perfectly happy with all my imperfections and you are not happy with yours. You have a notion of perfection and I have Osho - The First Principle\n137\nChapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial\nnone. I am perfect in my imperfections. I have accepted them totally, in toto. I am not trying to improve myself; I am simply the way I am. And I am happy the way I am.\nThe day you are also happy the way you are, the day you are also happy with all your imperfections, you are God. You are still God, whether you recognize it or you don't recognize it, but you have your ideas about God, and then you project those ideas. And if, sometimes, they are shattered -- and they will be shattered again and again because I cannot keep to your expectations ...\nI am a free man. I live the way I live. And see the whole point: I am not expecting anything from you; still you go on expecting things from me. My whole effort here is to help you to be yourself, and your whole effort here is to make me something that you want me to be. Drop all this nonsense.\nThat's why I say even if you can forgive me, that will be enough. You need not even say a thank-you.\nIt is very difficult to be safe amongst disciples; hence I need bodyguards. Because a disciple has \"surrendered,\" now he will take revenge. And of course, if he surrenders to me, he will take revenge on me. Where else will he go to take the revenge?\nWatch all these tendencies in you.\nIt was not Kovoor, it was not my criticism of Kovoor, that has hurt you. It is your idea of me, it is your expectation of me, that is feeling hurt. So drop the expectations; otherwise you will feel hurt again and again -- I will find other Kovoors. Sometimes, even if they are not there, I can invent! But I am going to destroy all your expectations of me because if you cannot drop expectations about me, how can you drop expectations about yourself? It will be impossible.\nAnd my whole work consists in a simple thing: to live a life without expectations, without hope, to live a life moment to moment, with no ideals.\nTwo men were chatting when the name of a mutual friend was mentioned. \"Are you a friend of Harry's?\" the first asked.\n\"Are we friends?\" the man said. \"Twenty years we are friends. There is nothing I would not do for Harry and there is nothing he would not do for me. In fact, for twenty years we have gone through life together, doing absolutely nothing for each other.\"\nI am doing nothing to you. You, please, do nothing to me. Even if this can happen, there will arise a great friendship. You need not feel obliged; you don't owe anything to me.\nQuestion\nMEHER BABA REMAINED SILENT FOR THE LAST FORTY-FIVE YEARS OF HIS\nLIFE. PLEASE COMMENT ON ITS IMPLICATIONS.\nThere is nothing much in it. He just got fed up with the questions of his disciples.\nAnd sometimes the idea arises in me too. So watch. Osho - The First Principle\n138\nChapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial Question\nOSHO, THERE ARE A FEW WORDS YOU ALWAYS PRONOUNCE WRONGLY.\nWHY?\nSo that you can say to people that at least in one thing Osho is consistent.\nMy English is not that of the Englishman; my English is not that of the American; it is not even of the Indian. My English is just MINE. So you have to tolerate it. And I am very reluctant to improve about anything.\nAnd my English has been of a great help to me. I used to live in Jabalpur, for many years.\nThe first day I was driving to the university, a woman, who lived next to me, an American woman, she wanted a lift. Now, this was going to be dangerous. This was the first day -- and every day then I will have to carry her and tolerate her chattering for almost half an hour, going to the university and coming.\nI had heard the American expression \"Can I drop you off somewhere?\" but I managed it into my English and I asked her, \"Can I throw you down someplace?\" And finished! She never asked again.\nOnce, another, an Englishwoman, got interested in me. I don't know what she saw in me, but she was almost in a fantasy. She was a lecturer in the same university, in the English department. She was after me. I was simply surprised as to what she saw in me because I don't see anything in myself; it is just emptiness there. But my English helped.\nYou know the expression ...? I had read somewhere, in a novel, that a young man gazes into the eyes of his woman and says to her that \"Your face, your beauty, your joy, your presence make time stand still.\" So I did the same to this woman.\nI told her, \"You have such a face that it would stop a clock.\" And finished! My English helped me.\nSometimes you will find it difficult too, because my structure of the sentences is mine, and sometimes the meaning I put into words is mine, the pronunciations are mine; sometimes you can't even get what I am saying. That helps you to keep awake. You have to listen attentively; you can miss. You cannot take me for granted.\nOne man was discussing with me about a politician, and I told the man, \"That politician is a spherical S.O.B.\"\nThe man was puzzled; he said, \"I have come across many S.O.B.'s in my life. But what do you mean by 'spherical'?\"\n\"I mean,\" I said to him, \"he is an S.O.B. any way you look at him.\" \"Spherical,\" that is my own word.\nAnd my English has a certain reputation, and I am not going to destroy it.\nA little lady from Fresno, visiting San Francisco, got quite a thrill out of attending a daring party in the Bohemia known as Telegraph Hill.\nOsho - The First Principle 139\nChapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial\nA friend who was showing her the sights pointed out a familiar-looking young couple and whispered, \"Don't look now, but those two artists there are living in sin.\"\n\"Sin, my foot!\" exclaimed the Fresno lady. \"I know them. It is just Lois and Maurice, and they were married in the Fresno Baptist Church five years ago.\"\nThe young couple overheard and quickly drew the Fresno lady aside. \"For God's sake don't tell anybody we are married,\" said the young man in a tense undertone. \"It would ruin our artistic reputation.\"\nI have a certain reputation of my English, hmm? And I am not going to change it in any way.\nQuestion\nWHAT IS PORNOGRAPHY, AND WHY DOES IT HAVE SO MUCH APPEAL?\nPornography is a by-product of religious repression. The whole credit goes to the priests.\nPornography has nothing to do with pornographers. The pornography is created, managed by the Church, by the religious people.\nIn a primitive, natural state, man is not pornographic. When human beings are naked and nude and man knows the woman's body and woman knows the man's body, you cannot sell PLAYBOY. It is impossible. Who will purchase PLAYBOY? And who will look into all that crap?\nThey have repressed so much that man's mind is fascinated of pornography. The whole credit goes to them. They have repressed so much that man's mind is boiling. The man wants to see the woman's body. Nothing wrong in it, a simple desire, a human desire. And the woman wants to know the man's body. A simple desire, nothing wrong about it.\nJust think of a world where trees are covered with clothes. There are people ... I have heard about some English ladies who cover their dogs and cats with clothes. Just think, cows and horses and dogs dressed. Then you will find new pornography arising. Somebody will publish a NUDE picture of a tree -- and you will hide it in a Bible and look at it!\nThis whole foolishness is out of religious repression.\nMake man free, allow people to be nude. I am not saying they should continuously be nude, but nudity should be accepted. On the beach, at the swimming pool, in the home ...\nnudity should be accepted. The children should take a bath with the mother, with the father, in the bathroom. There is no need for the father to lock the bathroom when he goes in. The children can come and have a talk and chitchat and go out. Pornography will disappear.\nEach child wants to know. \"How does my daddy look?\" Each child wants to\nknow, \"How does my mother look?\" And this is simply intelligence, curiosity. And the child cannot know what the mother looks like, and the child cannot know what the father looks like; now you are creating illness in the child's mind. It is YOU, that YOU are ill, and the illness will be reflected in the child's mind.\nOsho - The First Principle 140\nChapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial\nI am not saying sit nude in the office or in the factory. If it is hot, it is okay, but there is no need to be naked, it should not be an obsession; but this continuous obsession of hiding your body is just ugly.\nAnd one thing more. Because of the clothes, bodies HAVE become ugly, because then you don't care. You care only about the face. If your belly goes on becoming bigger and bigger, who bothers? You can hide it. Your body has become ugly because it is not exposed; otherwise you will think a little: the belly is getting too big. Just let one hundred people stand nude, and they all will be ashamed, and they will squirm and they will start hiding themselves.\nSomething is wrong. Why is it so? They know only about their face. The face they take care of; the whole body is neglected.\nThis is bad. This is not good. It is not in favor of the body, either.\nAny country where people are allowed a little freedom to be nude becomes more beautiful; people have more beautiful bodies. If American women are getting more beautiful and have more beautiful bodies there is no wonder in it. Indian woman will have to wait long; they can hide their ugly bodies in the saries very carefully. The sari is a great help.\nNudity should be natural, should be as natural as animals, as trees, as everything else is nude. Then pornography will disappear.\nPornography is there as a sort of mental masturbation; it is mind masturbation. You are not allowed to love women, you are not allowed to love men, you are not allowed to make as many contacts as possible; the mind is boiling and starts a sort of inner masturbation.\nPornography helps you; it gives you visions of beautiful women and beautiful men, to dream about, and it gives you a thrill.\nYour alive wife does not give you any thrill. With your alive wife you suddenly go dead.\nThere are people, even while making love to their wife, they are imagining some other woman; they are imagining some PLAYBOY picture. They can make love to their woman only when in their imagination there is some other woman, some fantasy. Then they get thrilled. They are not making love to their woman, and the woman is not making love to them.\nShe may be thinking of some actor or some hero or somebody. There are four people in each bed! Of course, it is too crowded, and you never contact the real person; those imaginary ones are standing in between.\nYou should know that masturbation -- mental or physical is a perversion. It does not exist in nature. Homosexuality does not exist in nature, but in zoos it comes into existence. In zoos animals start masturbating. In zoos animals even start becoming homosexually interested.\nWherever the situation is unnatural, unnatural perversions enter. In the military, in the army, people become homosexual, because it is an \"all-boys\" club, no woman available. Their pent-up energies start making them insane; they think they will go mad if they don't allow some outlet. In the boys' hostels, in the girls' hostels, where no boy can come, no girl can come, the other sex is not allowed, naturally pornography will be greatly enjoyed. It will help masturbation.\nBut these things have not been talked of directly. Now many will be offended -- why am I talking about these things? I am here to make everything clear to you so that you can become more and more natural. The appeal for pornography simply says that your mind is in an abnormal state. It is perfectly good to be interested in a beautiful woman, nothing wrong, but to have a picture of a nude woman and to get excited about it is just stupid. That's what people are doing with pornography.\nOsho - The First Principle 141\nChapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial\nI have heard a beautiful joke. Listen attentively, don't miss it.\nA husband was suspicious of his wife, so he hired a private detective to find out whether she had a lover or not. The detective, a Chinese immigrant, came back to report after only two days. His arm and nose were broken and his head was tied up in bandages.\n\"What happened?\" the husband inquired eagerly. \"Any proof yet?\"\n\"Well,\" the detective answered, \"I hid outside your house when you left in the morning.\nAfter half an hour a man came and let himself in with a key. I climbed a tree to see into the bedroom, and there was he holding she and she kissing he. So he play with she and she play with he; I play with me and I fall down from the tree.\"\nThat's what pornography is.\nBeware of all sorts of perversions. To love is good; to dream about it is ugly. Why? When the real is available, why go for the unreal? Even the real never satisfies! So how can the unreal satisfy? Even the real, in the final analysis, proves to be illusory, so what to say about the illusory?\nLet me repeat: Even the real, one day, proves to be just unreal, so what to say about the unreal?\nGo into the real love, and you will become so aware one day that even the real love, the so-called real love, will disappear. And when a man is completely beyond sexuality ... Not that I am saying \"TRY to go beyond,\" no, not at all, God forbid. What I mean when I say when a man \"goes beyond\" is that when a man has gone deeper into sex, into love, and has known and has found that there is nothing, that very finding takes him above. He starts floating above the earth, he grows wings. That transcendence is BRAHMACHARYA, that transcendence is celibacy. It has nothing to do with your effort; it has nothing to do with repression.\nA repressed person can never attain BRAHMACHARYA; he will become\npornographic.\nAnd there are a thousand and one ways of being pornographic. In the old Indian scriptures there are descriptions of great RISHIS sitting in meditation and beautiful women trying to seduce them, dancing around them, naked. And the stories say they are sent by the God of heaven to corrupt them because the God in heaven is afraid if they attain to their SAMADHI they will become competitors. The God of heaven is afraid of their competition, so when they are attaining closer and closer, coming closer to SAMADHI, he sends beautiful women to seduce them.\nNow, there is no God, and no beautiful women come from heaven; this is mind pornography. These RISHIS, these so-called seers, have repressed sex so much that at the last moment, when they are really getting closer to their innermost center, that repressed sex bursts forth, explodes. And in that explosion their own images, mind images ... It is a mind panorama, it is very colorful, and it is so colorful and looks so real that even they are deceived; they think really women are there.\nJust go in a cave for three months and be celibate and force celibacy. After three months you will be a great seer -- and you will start seeing things. That is what a great seer is. You will start seeing damsels and beautiful APSARAS from heaven coming and dancing around Osho - The First Principle\n142\nChapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial\nyou seducing you. They are just your mind picture. When you are deprived of reality, your dreams start almost looking like reality. That's what we call hallucination.\nIn those old days PLAYBOY magazine was not available, so the RISHIMUNIS had to depend on their own. Now you can have some support from the outside.\nBut beware: even the real is proved, finally, to be unreal. So don't move into the realms of the unreal. Go into the real, let it be a great experience. I am not against it, I am all for it, go into it, because only by going into it, one day, BRAHMACHARYA, one day, you simply get out of it.\nNot that love will disappear. In fact, for the first time love will appear, but a totally different kind of love. Buddha calls it compassion -- a cool love, with no sexual heat in it.\nYour being will become a benediction. Your very presence will make people feel your love.\nYour love will fall and shower on them. In your very presence, people will start moving into the unknown.\nYes, great compassion will arise in you. It is the same sexual energy, released from the sexual objects. Not repressed. Released. Not forcibly repressed, but understandably released.\nThe same sexual energy becomes love, compassion.\nAnd when love, compassion, arises you are fulfilled. Buddha has said two things are the goals: awareness and compassion. And both come out of the sex energy; both are born out of it. Those two are the flowers, ultimate flowers, of sex energy.\nThat lotus is waiting in you to flower. Don't waste your energies. Use your energies to understand them, go into them deeply, meditatively, so that one day that lotus opens.\nOsho - The First Principle 143\nChapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is 9\nYou: the Greatest Lie There Is\n19 April 1977 am in Buddha Hall\nTHE OFFICIAL, RIKO, ONCE ASKED NANSEN TO EXPLAIN TO HIM THE OLD\nPROBLEM OF THE GOOSE IN THE BOTTLE.\n\"IF A MAN PUTS A GOSLING INTO A BOTTLE,\" SAID RIKO, \"AND FEEDS HIM\nUNTIL HE IS FULL GROWN, HOW CAN THE MAN GET THE GOOSE OUT WITHOUT\nKILLING IT OR BREAKING THE BOTTLE?\"\nNANSEN GAVE A GREAT CLAP WITH HIS HANDS AND SHOUTED, \"RIKO!\"\n\"YES, MASTER,\" SAID THE OFFICIAL WITH A START. \"SEE,\" SAID NANSEN, \"THE GOOSE IS OUT!\"\n\"I do not seek, I find\", says Pablo Picasso. And I say to you: You need not seek, because if you seek, you will never find it. And you need not find it, also, because if YOU find it, it will not have been found at all.\nSeeking means the truth is not and you have to seek it. Seeking means the truth is hidden and you have to seek it. Seeking means the truth is far away, distant, and you have to journey to it. And truth is herenow. No pilgrimage is needed; one has not to go anywhere. Truth is not THERE and truth is not THEN. Truth is here and now, so all seeking is going astray.\nSeek, and you will not find, because in the very seeking you have missed the point, you have missed the first principle. In the very effort, you have gone away from the truth.\nSeeking is a desire. With the desire comes in the mind -- mind is nothing but desire.\nSeeking is in the future, and the future is not. Truth is always present, always present. Truth is always now; there is no other way for truth to be. You cannot say about truth, \"Truth was,\"\nand you cannot say about truth, \"Truth will be.\" That will be absolutely wrong. Truth IS -- and it is always so, and it will be always so, and it has always been\nso. Truth IS.\nHow can you seek that which is? One seeks that which is not yet. Seeking is in the future.\nSeeking assumes it, that it is not here. You seek money, you seek power, you seek prestige, you seek heaven; but how can you seek truth? That's why, let me repeat. seeking, you go astray. Seeking, you become a victim of desire. Seeking, the mind becomes predominant.\nSeeking, the secondary becomes primary and the primary is lost track of.\nAnd I say if YOU find it you have not found it at all. Because if YOU remain to find it, then it cannot be truth. Truth is found only when you are not. When truth is, you are not. You both cannot be present together. You are the greatest lie there is. If you are still there, then you will go on missing the truth. The very presence of you functions as a barrier. \"I\" cannot find; when the \"I\" is not there it is found.\nThat's why I say Picasso's statement is a half-truth. Half of it is true: \"I do not seek.\" But that half is untrue when he says, \"I find.\" It looks almost Zenlike, but it is not. A half-truth is Osho - The First Principle\n144\nChapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is\nmore dangerous than a plain lie because you can see the lie as the lie sooner or later, but the half-truth can go on pretending to be the whole truth; at least it appears like the truth. Many have been deceived by Picasso's statement. It is almost Zen: \"I do not seek, I find.\"\nIf he had said, \"I do not seek, and it is found,\" it would have been Zen. If the \"I\" remains, then truth will remain clouded. The \"I\" functions as a cloud, and the sun goes behind. The \"I\"\nfunctions as a darkness, as a vale of darkness. The \"I\" is very noisy, and the voice of truth is very small, still. If the \"I\" is there beating its drums, then it is almost impossible to hear the whispering of truth.\nYes, truth is a whisper. You feel it only when you are absolutely not. In your\nabsence it is present.\nSo this is the whole thing: if you are present, truth is absent; if you are absent, truth is present. To be absent is all that meditation is. To be absent is all that is involved in meditation.\nHow to become absent? How not to be? Yes, \"To be or not to be\" is the question. And ordinarily we decide to be. The moment we decide to be, the samsara. The moment we decide not to be, the nirvana. Yes, that is the basic question that encounters every human being: to be or not to be. A Buddha decides not to be.\nAnd the paradox is that those who decide not to be, they become true, and those who decide to be, they become a lie. The lie can persist; you can go on feeding it.\nTruth is, just is, only is. Seeking, you miss it. Seeking, you have started looking somewhere else. Seeking, you don't look HERE. Seeking, your eyes are turned upwards towards the sky. That's why whenever we think of God we look upwards towards the sky. It is very significant: God is far away, sitting in the seventh heaven, up. It is a long journey; only very rare people can do it -- saints, mahatmas, ascetics. All nonsense.\nGod is where you are right now! Not in the seventh heaven, but within you.\nBut about those seven heavens, the metaphor of \"seven\" is beautiful. God is not in the seventh heaven somewhere, but is hidden behind seven layers of lies. There is a very strange incident in Bodhidharma's life, the founder of Zen. It is said that Bodhidharma collapsed seven times and arose eight times, when he realized enlightenment. Collapsed seven times and arose eight times. Very significant. Those are the seven layers of the ego, the seven layers of the \"I\". Each \"I\" will help you to collapse, and if you cannot rise eight times, that means if you cannot rise at least one time without the ego, you will not attain.\nSo the whole question is not that the truth is very far. It is very close, very, very close. It is in you, it is you, it is your intrinsic nature, it is your DHARMA. That is the first principle, but somehow, seeking, you have missed it.\nSeeking, you have been for many lives. A seeker you have been. Nonseeking will reveal it.\nThat's why I say seeking, you go astray. Seeking, you go in dreams. How can you seek God? You have not known. How can you seek the unknown? You have never seen. How can you seek the unseen? Even if God comes across you, you will not be able to recognize him, because recognition is possible only if you have experienced him before. And you have not experienced him. He may have come across you many times in your life, and you will go on missing because how will you recognize him?\nOsho - The First Principle 145\nChapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is\nIt is impossible to seek the unknown. Then what do you do? First you create a dream about the unknown and you start seeking the dream. The Hindu has one dream of God, the Mohammedan has another dream, the Christian has still another -- but those are all dreams.\nThe Christian will attain to his dream. That is the misery, because if you persist too much, your dream will start becoming almost a reality. If you pour your energy into your dream too much, then your dream will start becoming a reality; you will convert it into a reality. But it is not reality; it is still a dream.\nThe fight between Hindus, Mohammedans, and Christians is not the fight about reality.\nThe fight is about their different dreams. Hindus have a certain idea of God, so have others, and they fight. They say, \"Our dream is true.\" When a Christian meditates deeply, he comes to see Jesus. A Jaina never comes to see Jesus, never. A Buddhist never comes to see Jesus; Jesus never crosses his path. For a Buddhist, Buddha comes on the path. For a Jaina, Mahavir crosses his path. They are their dreams; they are dreams and projections and desires. And if you persist too much, the mind has the faculty to impart reality to the dream.\nYou do it every day, so it is not something very strange. Every day in the night when you fall asleep you dream, and in the dream you never recognize the fact that it is a dream. In the dream it looks true. In the dream it looks real -- howsoever absurd. In the dream you see a dog is walking, and suddenly the dog becomes a cat, and you don't even doubt that it is possible. In the dream you\naccept even that. Your acceptance, your capacity to believe, is tremendous.\nEven the people who think they are skeptical, people who think they are great doubters, logicians, rationalists, even in their dreams all their rationalism is gone and all their doubt disappears. In their dreams they believe absurd things. In the morning, when they are awake, they will be amazed, but then it is too late.\nJust think of a person who is in a coma ... Once a woman was brought to me who had been in a coma for nine months. Now think, if she is dreaming for nine months, she must be thinking they are realities. A man can be in a coma for nine years, or ninety years -- or for nine lives. Then? The dream will look real. In fact, if this woman is awakened out of her coma for one minute and she looks around and falls into her dream again, which will be more real, her dream that has lasted for nine months, or the reality that she saw for one single minute? What will be her conclusion if she can conclude? She will conclude that she had fallen for one minute into sleep and she saw a dream and again the dream is gone, so she is awake and her reality continues.\nThe greatest possibility of the mind and the greatest capacity of the mind is imagination. It lives through imagination. The moment you start seeking truth you are moving in the direction of imagination. What are you seeking?\nZen says there is nothing to seek, because you don't know what is there. So if you seek, you will miss. Now, this is a very much higher standpoint. Jesus says, \"Seek, and you will find.\" A very much lower statement, nothing to be compared with Zen. Meaningful, meaningful for those who are starting on the journey, but if you follow Jesus, one day or other, you will understand that by seeking, you cannot reach. Jesus was talking to people who were not highly evolved, people who had not even started seeking. He had to teach them: \"Seek and you will find, knock and the door shall be opened unto you, ask and it shall be given to you.\"\nIf you go to a Zen Master he will smile; he will say, \"Start,\" because his statement is a higher statement. When you have sought and you have not found, when you have struggled hard and nothing comes in your hands except dreams, then the Zen Master's approach will become Osho - The First Principle\n146\nChapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is\npossible, you will be able to understand it. Then he will say, \"Seek, and you will not find.\nNow, please, drop seeking. Drop seeking and find it herenow!\"\nBut I am not saying that Jesus is wrong. I am saying it is a beginners' class. And unless you follow Jesus for a time you will not understand Zen. So Jesus will prepare you, Jesus will help you.\nJesus was talking to the Jews, who have been one of the most earthy races in the world. To talk Zen would have been impossible -- they would have killed him even earlier. They didn't allow him much life, only three years of ministry. At the age of thirty he started his work; by thirty-three he was gone. They could not tolerate even a very primary statement about religion.\nIt was not very rebellious, it was not very absurd. It was in tune with the Jewish thinking, but still they could not tolerate it. It was \"otherworldly\". He was talking about the world that he calls the Kingdom of God. Jews have been very worldly; that is their success. They are very down to earth, and this man was distracting them. They were seeking money and they were seeking power and prestige, and this man was talking about God. Jesus was trying to change their seeking towards religion. It is religion of the kindergarten class.\nZen people are talking about the highest statement. India's highest consciousness was transplanted into China, and China's highest consciousness, Taoism, met with Buddhism.\nThese are two of the greatest flowerings of human consciousness. Never again has humanity reached such a peak as Buddhism, as it reached in Buddha; and never again has it reached anything like Lao Tzu. And just think: Zen is a crossbreeding of Taoism and Buddhism. It is a meeting of Buddha and Lao Tzu. It is a meeting of two of the highest peaks. Naturally Zen goes still higher. Zen goes higher than Buddhism and higher than Taoism because it contains all that was beautiful in these two cultures, the ancientmost cultures, the longest seekers in the world, who have staked all that they had for their seeking. Zen is the purest flower.\nIn fact, Zen is not a flower. It is essence, it is fragrance. Even a flower has something gross in it, something of the earth. So remember it, when Zen is saying something, it is to be understood at the highest level; otherwise there will\nbe no understanding about it. You will misunderstand it.\nSeeking, you go astray; seeking, you go in dreams; seeking, you go somewhere else; and truth is here. Seeking, you go then; and truth is NOW. Seeking, you are, and seeking, you are too much. The more you seek, the more you feel you are. The harder and more arduous the seeking becomes, the stronger the ego becomes.\nSeeking, you are, and seeking, you are too much; and there is no space for the truth to be.\nYou fill the whole space of your being. Seeking, you are closed.\nHave you not seen this happening in ordinary life too? A man is suddenly told that his house is on fire. He rushes towards his house from the office or from his shop: now he cannot see what is happening in the market, on the road. Somebody says, \"Hello\"; he cannot hear.\nSomebody comes and collides with him, but he cannot see who he is, and he will not remember that somebody collided. His whole mind is narrow now -- his house is on fire. His mind is concentrated.\nSeeking means concentration, and truth is never achieved by concentration. Truth is achieved by meditation. And the difference is vital, and the difference is great. And you have to understand the difference because ordinarily people who don't know anything about meditation, they go on writing books in which they write that meditation is concentration.\nMeditation is not concentration! Meditation is just the opposite state of concentration.\nOsho - The First Principle 147\nChapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is\nWhen you concentrate your mind is narrowed down; when you meditate, you mind is widened. When you concentrate, there is an object on which you concentrate; when you meditate, there is no object.\nPeople come to me and they ask, \"On what to meditate?\" Then they are not asking about meditation. They are asking about concentration when they come and they say to me, \"I cannot concentrate. Osho, can you help me?\" Concentration means you want your mind to cling to something, you want your mind to remain with something. Concentration is a sort of attachment, so whenever your attachment is there you are concentrated.\nYour wife is dying, and if you are attached to her, you will forget the whole world. Now nothing exists except your dying wife. You will be sitting by her side and you will be concentrated; your mind will not go here and there.\nOr if you are driving a car and suddenly you see an imminent accident is going to happen\n-- some madman is coming, driving his car madly, and on the turn you see now it is too late, it is going to happen -- suddenly you will be concentrated, because you are too attached to life.\nThere will be no thoughts any more. Just a moment before, you were thinking to see your girl friend, a moment before, you were thinking to go to the movie tonight, or do this or that; suddenly all has disappeared; there is no thought in the mind, no object. You are too attached to life. Because of this attachment, all other objects have disappeared. You are concentrated now only on your life; only one thing has remained: your life.\nDostoevsky has written a memoir. He was young and he was a revolutionary, and he was caught by the czar with twenty other people, and they all were sentenced to death. The day came, ditches were dug, and they were standing in front of the ditches and the man was getting ready with the machine gun. Everything was ready.\nJust close by on a church tower there is a clock, and each moment is passing fast, and the life is disappearing. At exactly six o'clock, they will be shot dead. It is ten minutes to six.\nYou can imagine how concentrated they must have become. Dostoevsky writes, \"Never again have I been so concentrated in my life. All else disappeared. I could hear my heart throbbing, I could see my breathing for the first time, I felt my body for the first time. I had never felt my body, never heard my heartbeat, never seen my breath. Everything became simply concentrated -- and we could\nhear the clock moving.\nFive minutes, four minutes, three minutes ... and the concentration is becoming more and more and more. One minute ... and everything else has disappeared.\nWhen life is at stake, only life is in the mind.\nAnd then comes a horseman, running, and the czar has pardoned them; their death sentence has been converted into a life sentence.\nOne man, at exactly six o'clock, fell in the ditch, Died! without being shot. Must have become so concentrated with the idea of death. Died! Nobody could believe it. The officers ran. He was taken out of the ditch, but he was dead. He believed it; he must have become hypnotized with the idea of death. Death is coming, death is coming, fifteen minutes, death is coming ... It was coming for two, three months; now it was closer and closer and closer, and the mind became concentrated. The man fell and died.\nOsho - The First Principle 148\nChapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is\nAnother man shouted, \"I am dead!\" He became mad. For his whole life he remained shouting, \"I am dead. I have died, don't you know?\" He will meet people and say, \"Don't you know? I died on that day. Six o'clock they killed me. I am a ghost! \"\nDostoevsky himself could not believe it, because it was unimaginable, that the czar was going to forgive them. But he writes in his memoirs that \"Never again was I concentrated; that was the peak of concentration.\"\nIt is not meditation. If it was meditation, then Dostoevsky would have become enlightened. That peak of concentration?\nIt happens to you. When you are studying for an examination, as the examinations come closer, you become more and more concentrated. Just the night before, your mind functions so concentratedly. Once the examination is gone, the mind relaxes again.\nConcentration is a mind thing; meditation is a no-mind thing. Concentration means pouring your whole energy onto one object. Meditation means not pouring your energy onto any object, but just overflowing in all directions.\nFor example, if you are listening to me you can listen in two ways. You can listen in the wrong way: the wrong way is the way of concentration; you can just remain tense, strained. Or you can listen in a relaxed, let-go way; you can remain relaxed. E you listen in a tense way --\nthat is the meaning of the word \"attention\": \"with tension, concentration\" -- then you will not listen to the birds singing in the trees. Then you will listen only to me, and everything else will be blocked out, bracketed out. That means only this small voice that is here is in your concentration and the whole existence has been blocked out.\nMeditation is just the opposite: nothing is blocked out, you are open in all directions. You are listening to me; you are listening to the birds also. If the wind blows in the trees and the trees start a murmur, you will listen to that too. And there will be no distraction, remember.\nYou are so open, you listen to me and the bird and the wind, and they all become one. And when you can listen in that way, you have listened to God.\nWhen you listen meditatively, you listen to God -- whatsoever you listen to, it is God, it is God's message. He has reached you through the tree, through the wind, through the bird, through me. He is coming from everywhere, because he is everywhere. He surrounds you. So when you are open to everything that is happening, to all that is happening, you are herenow, you are in meditation. And this state is a state of nonseeking.\nConcentration is part of seeking; when you seek something you become concentrated.\nWhen you don't seek anything you become relaxed. When you seek something and you are concentrated, you are going away from yourself. Your object will be the goal, you forget yourself. Your arrow of consciousness goes only to the object. When you are not going anywhere, where will you be? When you are not going anywhere you will be where you are, you will be whoever you are. You will be simply relaxing and resting into yourself.\nAshtavakra says, \"Rest in yourself, and you will attain all.\" Because resting in yourself you will know who you are.\nSo it is not a question of seeking. Seeking, you are too much. Seeking, you are so arrowed towards something that you don't see anything else, your eyes don't allow all to enter into your being, and then there is no space for the truth to be. Seeking, you become a cloud and the sun goes behind. Hence, seeking, there is night and darkness and death.\nOsho - The First Principle 149\nChapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is\nWhen you are not seeking there is life, eternal life, and light and God, or you can choose any name which you prefer. Buddha calls it nirvana, nonseeking: you have arrived. In fact, you had never gone anywhere else; you were only imagining.\n\"Tell us, Master,\" a monk asked Daito ... Daito was a great Zen Master.\n\"Tell us, Master, when Shakyamuni Buddha saw the morning star, what did he see?\" ...\nIn Zen this is the legend, that Buddha was seeking and seeking for six years, then he got tired and fed up with seeking, and one day he dropped seeking too. As one day he had dropped his kingdom, his family, his THIS world, one day he dropped his OTHER world too. As one day he had become disinterested in the material, a day came when he became disinterested in the spiritual too. And that was the night when he rested in himself -- because there was nothing to seek. So he slept under a tree, the Bodhi tree; that became the most famous tree in the world. He rested under the Bodhi tree, slept well. There was no seeking, so there was no dreaming either. The whole night was just a peaceful rhythm, not even a thought, because the material world was gone, the spiritual world was gone. It was an absolute rest into oneself.\nBy the morning, the Zen legend says, his eyes opened. Not that he opened his\neyes, because there was nothing to do now: he will not even open his eyes. The Zen legend says the eyes opened because the rest was complete. See the difference. You can open your eyes; then there is strain. You can close your eyes; then there is strain. When the eyes are closed by themselves there is rest; when the eyes open by themselves, then there is rest.\nWhen a life is not a life of doing, but happening, then there is rest.\nThe eyes opened and he saw the last morning star setting, it was just disappearing, the last glimpse of it, in a moment it was gone, and he became enlightened. The last trace disappeared with the disappearing morning star, and he was utterly empty. He was utterly nobody. He became a nothingness, a pure nothingness, a content-less consciousness.\nWhat is the significance of this last star disappearing? When the eyes opened and he saw the last star, there was a little concentration, a slight concentration, must be the old habit, thousands of lives of old habit. He must have become a little strained; a little concentration must have arisen. Looking at the last star, he must have become focused, his consciousness must have become narrow -- just out of old habit. There was nothing to look at now. But then the star disappeared\n-- it was the last star and the sun was going to rise soon, so the star disappeared -\n- the star disappeared, and the last object of concentration disappeared.\nSuddenly he was released from all concentration, suddenly there was freedom, there was no content. The last star disappearing took away the last trace of concentration. He was there\n-- and he was not there. He was there for the first time authentically -- and he was not there for the first time as an \"I\", as an ego.\nOsho - The First Principle 150\nChapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is Some seeker asked Master Daito ...\n\"Tell us, Master, when Shakyamuni Buddha saw the morning star, what did he see?\" ...\nWhy did he become enlightened by seeing the last star?\nMany people have copied it -- people are foolish, people are monkeys. Many Buddhists sit, they even go to Bodhgaya -- they come from China, from Korea, from Japan, from Ceylon --\nthey go to Bodhgaya, they sit under the Bodhi tree, they try to rest the whole night, and they watch, many times it must be, in the night they must be looking: whether the last star is there or gone. And they must be closing their eyes again -\n- it is still night and there are so many stars -- and they must be afraid and tense: will they be able to see the last star, or will they miss? And they have to see the last star disappearing.\nOnce a Japanese man came and stayed with me. I said, \"Why have you come from Japan?\"\nHe said, \"To see the last star disappearing.\" I told him, \"Can't you see a last star disappearing in Japan? Don't the stars behave the same way there? Don't they disappear in the morning?\nFor what have you come here?\" And he said, \"I have come to sit under the Bodhi tree.\" But any tree will do. Buddha was not sitting under that tree specifically. It was just a coincidence, it was accidental. He had not searched for that tree. That tree was in no way special; it was as ordinary a tree as any tree.\nYou can sit under any tree and under any sky and in any country, but the question is not of country, not of the sky, not of the stars, not of the tree. The question is, \"Has your attachment to things -- and attachment to other-worldly things -- disappeared, or is it still there?\"\nNow, in fact, you have come to sit under the Bodhi tree because you want to become enlightened. The desire. The seeking. You have come as a seeker, and Buddha did attain because he was not a seeker that night.\nThis is how things go on and man goes on imitating and becoming foolish.\n\"Tell us, Master, when Shakyamuni Buddha saw the morning star, what did he see?\"\n\"Clean blank nothing,\" Daito replied at once. And then added, \"But if a person\nhas only so much as just one speck of dust in his eyes, he may look at a blank and see all sorts of imaginary things.\"\nJust a speck of dust will do, just a small speck of desire will do, and then you will start seeing imaginary things. If you really want to see that which is, then the eyes have to be utterly clean, blank. With those blank eyes you are a Buddha\n-- with those empty eyes.\nSeeking, one never finds. Let it be a fundamental remembrance. So Pablo Picasso is true, but only half true.\nAnd half-truths are really dangerous. They can pretend, they can masquerade as truths, as whole truths. That's what happens. Whenever a man like Buddha moves, walks on the earth, that's what happens -- his truths become half-truths in our minds. A half-truth is a reflection of truth. A half-truth is a shadow of truth. In our monkey minds, in our imitative minds, we start Osho - The First Principle\n151\nChapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is\nimitating half-truths. And there is something which has to be understood. A half- truth deceives better.\nBut Pablo Picasso could not have done better, because art itself cannot go beyond the half-truth. That's the difference between art and religion. Art is the world of the shadows, the world of the reflections, the world of imagination, the world of dreams, the world of desires, the world of projections. Art cannot give you the whole truth, but the best art is always giving you half of it -- that too the best art. I am not talking about the third-rate art. A third-rate art is simply a lie, a fantasy, a fiction. But Pablo Picasso is one of the greatest artists the world has ever produced. The best art always give you half; more is not possible through art.\nThe artist has glimpses of truth, reflected in the world of his dreams, in the world of his imagination. The artist is a pool of imagination, a lake of imagination. In that lake is reflected the full moon. And sometimes the moon in the lake looks far more beautiful than the real moon. On the glossy, silent surface of the lake, on the placid, silent surface of the lake, the moon looks even more innocent. But that is not a real moon -- although the reflection belongs to the real.\nThat is the difference between the mystic and the artist. The best artist comes closer to the mystic than anybody else, but the artist is not a mystic. He is a shadow, a shadow mystic.\nWilliam Blake or Pablo Picasso or Emerson or Rabindranath, they give beautiful reflections of the truth. And even the reflection is so enchanting, what to say about the original?\nBut if you jump into the lake to find the moon, even the reflection will disappear. You are not supposed to jump into the lake. And where the reflection is, you are not to go in that direction. You have to move exactly in the opposite direction, then you will find the real.\nThe artist has some quality of the mystic; he is on the way to becoming a mystic in some life. The mystic has all the qualities of the artist, plus.\nSometimes mystics have been artists, particularly Zen mystics. They have painted. They have written poems, haiku. They have carved wood, they have sculpted. They were great artists. In fact, all Zen Masters have been creative people.\nThat should also be remembered. When you have attained to a state of consciousness, your consciousness has to create something, something visible. You have to materialize something of your consciousness into the world so that this world also becomes beautiful. And people who cannot understand religion at least can understand art. You may not be able to understand the meaning of the Upanishads, but the very poetry of it appeals, and if the poetry appeals, then the truth is making a way towards your heart. You may not be able to meditate, but if somebody is dancing with deep meditation, that dance may appeal, and through the dance, lingering by the side, something of the meditation will enter into your being.\nGurdjieff had prepared a group of dancers, and he took the dancers to many great cities of the world. It was a rare opportunity made available. When in New York those meditators danced, people were suddenly amazed, they could not believe what was happening. The dancers created such meditative energy, such a great wave of energy, that those who had come just to see the dance suddenly forgot the dance completely. Something else was there by the side, a door opened through it.\nAnd Gurdjieff used to do the \"stop\" exercise. The dancers are dancing, a group of twenty, thirty dancers, and they are going wild in their dance, and suddenly he will shout by the side, Osho - The First Principle\n152\nChapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is\n\"Stop!\" And they will all become just marble statues, as they were. If the hand was raised, it will remain raised. If one leg was up, it will remain up.\nAt one moment when he said, \"Stop!\" they were in such a position that they all fell -- fell from the stage, in front of the audience in the hall. But not a single person moved; they fell as if dead. And one man who was watching, something inside him also fell. The very shocking incident, these people fallen as if dead, and something changed in his mind. He became one of the great followers of Gurdjieff and attained to greater heights of consciousness.\nLooking at a Zen painting you will be surprised because the painting brings to you something of the man who has painted it. If you look at modern painting, that too brings something to you. If you look at a modern painting long enough, you will start feeling a little crazy. If you put too many modern paintings in your bedroom, beware, you will have nightmares. Those paintings will start entering into your dreams. You cannot look at a modern painting for long; you have to move. You start feeling weird, something is wrong, something is bizarre.\nThe modern painter is insane. He is painting out of his insanity. If you look at a Zen painting, a silence oozes out of it, suddenly something beautiful surrounds you. You are transported to another consciousness. The painting carries something of the touch of the Master. The painting has been done in deep meditation; the painting has been done by one who has arrived.\nGurdjieff used to call such art \"objective art\". When somebody who has attained to consciousness does something, that something becomes objective art. Looking at that thing, you will have some glimpse of the Master. The Master may have been dead for three thousand years, that doesn't matter. The painting, the statue, the carving will represent him, and through it you can again become connected to him. If you know how to meditate with a painting, it will be easier.\nWithin these twenty years a rare thing has come to light because of too much use\nof drugs.\nThe underground world of drugs has stumbled upon a very significant fact; they call it\n\"contact high\". It is exactly the meaning of SATSANG. Let me explain it to you.\nA \"contact high\" is a state. Somebody has taken LSD and is turned on, and you love the man, you really love the man, or the woman, you really relate to him -- the man or the woman is somebody who turns you on by her presence or his presence. The person has taken LSD.\nYou simply sit by the side, and you love the person, and the person's presence turns you on, and by and by you will start feeling that the LSD is affecting you too, that somehow his consciousness is infiltrating your consciousness, that your space is being overpowered. And you will start feeling high. This is contact high.\nThis is the meaning of SATSANG too, on a different plane. If somebody has attained, just being with him in deep love. in deep gratitude, in deep relatedness, and you will start feeling that something, through him, reaches your heart, stirs your being, and you are put on a totally different plane, where you cannot go by yourself. You are transported, carried to it. Yes, it too is a contact high.\nThat's why in the East we have praised SATSANG so much, to be in the presence of a Master, to attain contact high. And once you have started attaining through somebody, by and by you can find your own way.\nOsho - The First Principle 153\nChapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is\nThis contact high is possible even after thousands of years, through objective art. Read some haiku of Basho, small haiku. Read one haiku, repeat it, sing it, chew it, swallow it deeply, and then sit silently, waiting for the meaning to be revealed. Don't think about it; thinking, you will go astray. Don't analyze it; analyzing, you will go far away. Meditate, just be with it, let it be with you, and suddenly you will find something is changing in your consciousness. You are moving upwards, or you are moving deeper.\nThe very small haiku can turn you on. It can almost become an LSD trip because the haiku carries Basho's consciousness, condensed. It is no ordinary poetry. It is not written by a poet, not by an artist. It is done by a Master.\nAnd the Master has put it almost like a mantra. If you simply allow it to spread its meaning on your being, its fragrance on your being, you will be in the state of contact high.\nThat's why I say Picasso's statement is a half-truth. \"I do not seek\" is the half- truth, and \"I find\" is the half-untruth, because it is never the \"I\" that finds it. \"I\" is the barrier, the cloud, the hindrance, the obstacle. Truth is found, but not by \"I\". Truth is found only when there is no\n\"I\", when there is nobody to find it. Truth is found only when there is nobody to seek it and nobody to find it.\nNow, the \"I\" has seven layers, those seven times when Bodhidharma fell and again rose.\nYou will also fall seven times before you can attain to enlightenment. The first layer consists of the past: \"I\" is memory. Go with me into it as deeply as possible because this will lead you to the first principle. The first principle cannot be said, but can be showed, how you can attain it.\nThe first layer of \"I\" consists of memory, the past. If you want to get rid of the \"I\" you will have to get rid of the past. Many people come to me and they say, \"We would like to drop this ego.\" But they think that the ego is a noncomplex thing, a simple thing. It is not. It is very complex, the most complex. In fact, the one who wants to drop it may be the ego itself. That is so subtle, it is so tricky. Layer upon layer. The first layer is the memory.\nIf you really want to drop the ego -- and that is the only way to find the truth; all religion consists only of dropping these seven layers -- don't live in the memory. By and by, the moment you catch hold of yourself, that you are moving in the memory, immediately slip out of it. Immediately. Don't waste a single moment. I am not saying repent about it, I am not saying feel guilty about it, no, because that too will be the past. I am simply saying the moment you find you were moving into a dream about the past, a nostalgia, the moment you find it so, just slip out of it. There is no need to fight with it. If you fight, you will be defeated.\nThere is no need to feel angry about it. If you feel angry you will be defeated. You need not value it in any way, good or bad. You simply do one thing: the moment you find out, slip out of it.\nAnd the one who finds it red-handed is your awareness. Eckhart says the one who finds is God, God within you.\nJust try. Whenever you find your memory is hovering around you too much, the one who finds this sudden recognition that \"Yes, I am again in the memory,\" that one, that awareness, is God within you. Slip out of the memory.\nAnd I say slip out of it because there is no need to fight. Fighting, you will cling to it.\nFighting, you will have to be there. If you have to fight with somebody you have to be there.\nDon't fight.\nOsho - The First Principle 154\nChapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is\nAnd you are capable of slipping out, just as a snake slips out of the old skin. Go on slipping out of the memory. Memory is an old skin. In fact, you have already slipped out of it; it is just in the mind, it is nowhere else.\nThe second layer consists of unawareness. We live almost in a drunken state. We live with the minimum of consciousness. You go on doing things, you go on moving, this and that, but you are not conscious. Have you ever had any moments of consciousness so that you can see, you can compare?\nFor example ... Just now! See what is there. Gather yourself together. Just be herenow and see what is there, and you will find your consciousness is more, you have come out of a fog.\nSoon you will again disappear into the fog. This fog surrounds you. Sometimes you come out of it. Sometimes something penetrates your fog, brings you out.\nBut ordinarily, life is so monotonous, there is no surprise, nothing brings you out.\nWhenever you are a little more aware, many things happen. If you watch you will understand. A beautiful woman passes by; suddenly you become more aware. A bird on the wing, you were watching an empty sky and a bird passes by\n...\nRamkrishna attained to his first SAMADHI, to his first satori, by seeing a row of cranes against the black clouds. He was very young, must have been thirteen. He was sitting by the lake of his town, it was cloudy, dark clouds were gathering, the beginning of the rain, and suddenly a row, many white cranes against the black clouds. Almost like lighting they were there and they were gone, and he attained to his first SAMADHI. For days he was drunk with the unknown, he danced, sang. His town's people, his family thought he had gone mad. But he was so happy.\nThat sudden experience. Something penetrated like a sword. Something was cut.\nSometimes it happens to you too. You don't take account of these moments, because you are afraid. You try to forget them. And they are so extraordinary and they are so exceptional and so rare that even to talk about them, nobody will believe it. So you don't take account of them; you think, \"Must be a fantasy, an imagination.\" But one day in the morning suddenly the world is beautiful -- for no reason at all. The reason IS there: the reason is you are more aware. Maybe you rested well in the night, it was a good sleep, the dreams were not too many, your stomach was not too full of food or hungry. Things somehow went well, and in the morning you felt on the top of the world. It is nothing but awareness.\nWith a friend you have not seen for many years, suddenly you become more aware.\nAnything that makes you more aware, watch it, take account of it, remember it, so that you can go more and more into it. Don't put it aside. Don't neglect it. It has to be fed and watered, taken care of.\nThe third layer of \"I\" is ambition, comparison with the others, where I am, higher or lower, inferior or superior, ahead or lagging behind -- who I am. Watch it: never compare. You are you. And there is nobody like you, so comparison is not possible. And everybody is so unique and so different, how can you\ncompare? Drop comparison. Whether you find yourself caught in comparison, immediately drop it, then and there. It is not good to carry these things in the mind longer; otherwise they leave traces, they make grooves in the mind. Never compare.\nSomebody is more intelligent, somebody is more beautiful, somebody is more healthy ... Don't compare. You are you.\nOsho - The First Principle 155\nChapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is\nAnd this is the way God wanted you to be. Feel fulfilled the way you are and accept yourself. Don't condemn yourself.\nThe fourth layer of \"I\" consists of future, always thinking ahead, what to do tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. Or people are so mad, they are thinking of what to do in the next life: where to go, to hell or heaven?\nPeople come to me and they ask, \"Osho, what do you say about life after death?\" I say,\n\"You are not alive even now, and you are talking about life after death? I don't even see life before death.\"\nMan is not! Man only thinks that he is. Man has not happened yet. Rarely it happens. Once in a while, in a Buddha or a Bodhidharma a man is there; otherwise you are just a belief. And you are thinking about life after death? Think of life after birth! Think of life before death.\nThink of life now. Don't go into the future too much.\nI am not saying that if you want to go to Bombay don't book a ticket -- I am not saying that. Otherwise there are fools of that type too. One day I talked in the morning, \"Don't think of the future,\" and by the evening I received a letter. One friend threw his passport into the river. \"Why bother? 'Don't think of the future,' Osho has said.\" I am not saying that. There is a practical world, but that is not a problem at all. To carry a passport is not a problem.\nTo carry fantasies about the future is a problem. A passport is not such a burden. To think about tomorrow and to go and book a ticket is not a problem. These are factual things, ordinary, practical things. But to think that tomorrow you will be happy, not today, that tomorrow you will love, not today, that tomorrow you will sing, not today, is dangerous --\nbecause tomorrow never comes. Again when it comes, it will be today, and your old habit will say, \"Tomorrow I will be happy.\" Tomorrow again and again, you will be happy, and you will never be happy.\nWhat I am saying is psychological future has to be dropped. The ordinary future is okay, it is not a problem at all.\nThe fifth layer consists of conditionings. You have been conditioned -- Hindu, Mohammedan, Jaina, Buddhist, English, German, Indian -- these layers are there. Start dropping them.\nAgain, please, don't throw your passport!\nThese ideas from the mind -- that I am a German or a Japanese or a Chinese -- are just foolish. You were born just as pure consciousness and you will die as pure consciousness, and all these are just dresses, formalities, forms, what Hindus call NAM-RUP, name and form.\nBut you are not confined to them, you are not contained in them; you are beyond them.\nThe sixth layer consists of arrogance, of nonhumbleness. One has to learn humbleness because that is reality. We are interdependent, so how can we be arrogant? You cannot live without the air, you cannot live without fire, you cannot live without the sun, you cannot live without the trees, you cannot live without the woman, woman without the man -- you cannot live at all independently. So all arrogance is just ignorance. We are interdependent, we interpenetrate each other, and everything is required.\nIf the sun sets tonight and never rises again we will die. Within ten minutes we will die. If all the forests disappear and the trees disappear we will die, we will not be able to live. We breathe through the trees, they are continuously working for us and we are working for them.\nOsho - The First Principle 156\nChapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is\nDon't think that they are slaves and we are masters. Nobody is a slave here and nobody is a master; everybody is a master here and everybody is a slave here. This is humility. They go on releasing oxygen for you; they serve you. And you go on releasing carbon dioxide for them, they live on carbon dioxide; so you serve them. They serve you, you serve them.\nWe are servants of each other or masters of each other, but we are all in the same boat. The animals, the trees, the birds, the rocks, we are all in the same boat. We exist in a togetherness; that's the meaning of humbleness.\nI am not saying become humble and start being arrogant about your humbleness and start saying that \"I am the most humble man in the world.\" That will be arrogance again.\nHumbleness is an understanding, not a cultivation.\nAnd the last layer of \"I\" consists of imitations. We learn to imitate -- that's what I mean when I say we are monkeys. Somebody is doing something: we start doing that. Somebody is making something: we start making that. We learn through imitation. Good for the children because otherwise children will never learn, but when will you become mature, when will you start not imitating, and being true to yourself?\nIf these seven layers are dropped, you will simply become aware of who you are. You are God, as everybody else is God.\nThese seven layers are the \"bottle\".\nNow let me tell you this beautiful anecdote. It is one of the most beautiful anecdotes in the Zen literature, and Zen has many beautiful anecdotes. This is one of the topmost. Listen to it.\nTHE OFFICIAL, RIKO, ONCE ASKED NANSEN ...\nNansen was a great Master. You must have heard another story, I must have told you sometime. A great professor comes to see Nansen. The professor was the head of the department of philosophy in a university. He comes, and immediately he asks, \"Do you believe in God? Is there any life after death? Has man a soul?\"\nNansen says, \"Wait. Let me prepare tea for you. You are tired and you are perspiring. And there is no hurry; these problems can wait a little. Let me prepare tea for you.\" And he prepares the tea. This is the humbleness of a Zen Master.\nHe brings tea. He goes on pouring the tea in the cup. The cup is full and the tea starts overflowing into the saucer, and then the saucer is full, and the professor shouts, \"What are you doing? Are you mad? Now there is not any space, not even for a single drop, and you go on pouring and you go on pouring. It will start dropping on your floor!\"\nAnd Nansen laughs and he says, \"So you understand. Now do you have any questions, still?\"\nThe professor says, \"Why, what do you mean? How does this explain my questions?\"\nAnd Nansen says, \"Have you any space in your head? I can give you the answer, but there is no space. I don't see any space in your head. And you are alert, very alert; you can see that when the cup is full, no more tea should be poured in. Go, please, and clean your skull. Empty your skull and come back! Because these questions are such that they can only be answered to an empty skull.\"\nOsho - The First Principle 157\nChapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is Nansen is a rare man.\nTHE OFFICIAL, RIKO, ONCE ASKED NANSEN TO EXPLAIN TO HIM THE OLD\nPROBLEM OF THE GOOSE IN THE BOTTLE.\nThe problem is very ancient. It is a koan; it is given to a disciple, that he has to meditate on it. It is absurd; you cannot \"solve\" it. A koan is something which cannot be solved.\nRemember, it is not a puzzle. A puzzle has a clue; a koan has no clue. A koan is a puzzle without any clue. Not that more intelligence will solve it. No, no intelligence will ever solve it. Even if it is given to God, it will not be solved. It is made in such a way that it cannot be solved. This is a koan.\n\"IF A MAN PUTS A GOSLING INTO A BOTTLE,\" SAID RIKO, \"AND FEEDS HIM\nUNTIL HE IS FULL GROWN, HOW CAN THE MAN GET THE GOOSE OUT WITHOUT\nKILLING IT OR BREAKING THE BOTTLE?\"\nDon't break the bottle -- and the goose has to be taken out -- and don't kill the goose. Now, these are the two conditions to be fulfilled. The koan becomes impossible. The bottle has a small neck; the goose cannot come out from it. Either you have to break the bottle or you have to kill the goose. You can kill the goose, and piece by piece you can take the goose out, or you can break the bottle, and the goose can come out alive, whole. But the condition is the bottle has not to be broken and the goose has not to be killed. The goose has to come out whole and the bottle has to remain whole. Nothing has to be destroyed; no destruction allowed.\nNow, how are you going to solve it? But meditating on it, meditating on it ... one day it happens that you see the point. Not that you solve the problem, suddenly the problem is no more there.\nNANSEN GAVE A GREAT CLAP WITH HIS HANDS AND SHOUTED, \"RIKO!\"\n\"YES, MASTER,\" SAID THE OFFICIAL WITH A START. \"SEE,\" SAID NANSEN, \"THE GOOSE IS OUT!\"\nNow, it is tremendously beautiful. What he is saying is that the goose has never been in, the goose has always been out. What is he saying, the moment he said, \"Riko!\"? What happened? Those seven layers of ego disappeared and Riko became aware. The shout was so sudden, the sound was so unexpected. He was expecting a philosophical answer.\nThat's why sometimes the Zen Master will hit you on your head or throw you out of the window or jump upon you or threaten you that he will kill you: he will do something so that those seven layers of ego are immediately transcended and your awareness, which is the center of all, is alert. You are made alert.\nOsho - The First Principle 158\nChapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is\nNow, shouting \"Riko!\" so suddenly, for no reason at all -- and he has brought a small puzzle to be solved and this Master suddenly shouts \"Riko!\" -- he cannot see the connection.\nAnd that is the whole clue to it. He cannot see the connection, the shout startles him, and he says, \"Yes, Master.\"\n\"See,\" said Nansen, \"the goose is out!\" Those seven layers of the bottle are crossed.\n\"Yes, Master\" -- in that moment Riko was pure consciousness, without any layer. In that moment, Riko was not the body. In that moment, Riko was not the mind. In that moment, Riko was just awareness. In that moment, Riko was not the memory of the past. In that moment, Riko was not the future, the desire. In that moment, he was not in any comparison with anybody. In that moment, he was not a Buddhist or a Mohammedan or a Hindu. In that moment, he was not a Japanese or an Indian.\nIn that moment, when the Master shouted \"Riko!\" he was simply awareness, without any content, without any conditioning. In that moment, he was not young, old. In that moment, he was not beautiful, ugly. In that moment, he was not stupid, intelligent. All layers disappeared.\nIn that moment, he was just a flame of awareness.\nThat is the meaning when the Master says, \"See, the goose is out -- and I have not broken the bottle, I have not even touched the bottle.\" The bottle means the ego, those seven layers. \"I have not broken the bottle, it is there, and I have not killed the goose. And the goose is out.\"\nNow, there are three types of religions in the world. One which will destroy the bottle.\nThen you become very vulnerable, then you become very insecure, then great trembling arises in you, and then there is every possibility you may go mad. That sort of thing happens many times in India. There are methods which can destroy the bottle, easier methods. They destroy the bottle, and the goose is out; but then the goose has no house to abide in, no shelter; then there is every possibility the man may go mad. And many people in India, seeking, searching, working towards the unknown become mad. When the unknown comes into them, they have no protection.\nRemember, you need protection even against God because God can be too much too suddenly. Those protections have not to be destroyed; practically, they have to remain there.\nJust think of a person who has no ego. Now, the house is on fire: he will not run out. For what? \"I am not. The fire cannot burn me, because I am not.\" Just think of a man who has no ego, and he is standing in the middle of the road, and there comes a bus and the driver honks and honks, and he does not bother. He is the immortal soul, he is not the ego. This state can be dangerous. It happens if you destroy the bottle.\nZen says don't destroy the bottle. Use it when it is needed. Whenever you feel to have protection, the goose simply goes inside the bottle. Sometimes one needs rest, and sometimes the bottle is also useful. It can be put to a thousand and one uses. The ego can be used if you know that you are not the ego. Then the ego cannot use you, you can use it.\nAnd there are methods which will save the bottle and kill the goose -- self- destructive methods are there -- so one becomes more and more unaware. That is what I mean when I say kill the goose: one becomes more and more unaware. Drugs can do that. Drugs have been used in India for thousands of years. They\ncan kill the goose. The bottle remains protected, but the goose is killed. If you take some foreign chemicals inside your being and your nature is Osho - The First Principle\n159\nChapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is\nnot ready to absorb them, by and by you will kill the goose, your consciousness will be gone, you may fall in a coma.\nThe first possibility, if the bottle is broken and thrown; you may go mad. The second possibility, if the goose is killed, or almost killed: you will become so unconscious that you will become a zombie. You can find zombies. In many monasteries there are zombies, whose goose is killed, or at least drugged. And there are mad people, maniacs.\nZen says avoid both. The bottle has to remain and the goose has to come out. This is a great synthesis.\n\"YES, MASTER,\" SAID THE OFFICIAL WITH A START. \"SEE,\" SAID NANSEN, \"THE GOOSE IS OUT!\"\nIt must have been a moment of great discovery to Riko. He must have seen it, \"Yes, it is out.\" He is fully aware. The trick worked, the device worked, the shouting and clapping worked. In fact, Riko must have been almost on the verge; otherwise shouting would not do.\nYou can go on shouting. Clapping won't do. But the man must have been just on the verge of it. Just a small push, and he has jumped the barrier.\nMeditate over it. This is the way to attain the first principle: to know that the goose can be out without destroying the bottle, that you can be God without destroying your humanity, that you can be God without destroying your ordinariness.\nA disciple of His Divine Grace Prabhupad came to see me. Prabhupad is the founder of the Krishna Consciousness movement. Naturally, to be respectful to me, he also called me His Divine Grace. I said, \"Don't call me that; just call me\n'his Divine Ordinariness'.\"\nThe ordinary is the extraordinary. The ordinary has not to be destroyed. Once the ordinary is in the service of the extraordinary it is beautiful, it is tremendously beautiful.\nLet me repeat: the trivial is the profound, samsara is nirvana. Whatsoever you are, there is nothing wrong with it. Just something is missing. Nothing wrong with it! Something is simply missing. Just that missing link has to be provided, that plus, and everything that you have becomes divine.\nLove has not to be destroyed; only awareness has to be added to it. Relationship has not to be destroyed; only meditation has to be added to it. You need not go from the marketplace, you need not go to any cave and in the Himalayas; only God has to be called there in the marketplace.\nThe bottle is beautiful, nothing is wrong in it. You just have to learn that you can come out of it whenever you want and you can go into it whenever you want, that it is your pleasure. It is almost like the house. When you feel too cool or cold in the house, freezing cold, you get out under the sky, under the sun, to warm yourself. Then it becomes too warm and you start perspiring; you go into the house. You are free. The same door takes you out, the same door takes you in, and the house is not the enemy.\nOsho - The First Principle 160\nChapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is\nBut if you cannot get out of the house, then something is wrong. There is no need to leave the house, there is no need to drop being a householder. There is only one thing needed: in the house become a sannyasin, in the world remain in such a way that the world is not in you.\nSee, the goose is out. In fact, the goose has always been out, just a recognition is needed.\nOsho - The First Principle\n161\nChapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray 10\nAll Going Is Going Astray\n20 April 1977 am in Buddha Hall Question\nTHERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN I FEEL NO HOPE, WITHOUT FEELING\nDESPERATE, WHEN THERE IS RECOGNITION THAT THE \"I\" HAS FOUGHT\nENOUGH AND CANNOT HELP ANYMORE. YET UNDER THESE MOMENTARY\nCOVERS LINGERS THE ONE AND ONLY LONGING: TO BECOME MY REAL\nNATURE, TO EXPERIENCE TRUTH AND TO LIVE IT IN THE WORLD. MY MIND\nPLEASES ITSELF TO CALL THIS LONGING AN AUTHENTIC, GENUINE THIRST.\nHOWEVER, THE SUSPICION IS THERE THAT IT IS JUST A WAY TO HIDE MY\nPLAIN GREED.\nThe question is from Gunakar. Yes, Gunakar, it is a way to hide the greed. And not only that, it is a way to avoid the real. It is not a thirst for the real; it is a way to escape from the real. All greed, all desire, is an escape from the real. The desire is for that which is not. That which is already there; you need not be greedy about it, you need not desire it. Whether you desire or not does not make any difference. It is there. By desiring, you will miss, because you will create a\ncloud around yourself.\nThis is how the mind goes on playing games. It can play the game in the name of reality too, in the name of God, in the name of enlightenment, nirvana.\nOne thing has to be remembered always, that you are not to become real, you are real. That which you are is the reality. Gunakar has said: Only one longing lingers, to become my real nature. But then who are you? You are your real nature. What else can you be? How else can you be? There is no way to go away from your reality. There is no way to go against it. There is no way to be anything else other than it.\nBut you can forget about it. You can start looking in some other direction. All that is possible is to be forgetful. You cannot lose contact with reality; you can only forget it. You can start looking in some other direction. You can put it at the back. You can avoid your eyes.\nYou can pretend that you are not the real.\nThe first thing: you are the real. Whatsoever you are is your reality. It has not to be attained; it is already there. It has happened. Nirvana is not somewhere in the future. Either it is now or never. To seek it is to miss it. If you want to find it, don't seek it. Just be herenow.\nAnd when I say just be herenow, don't make a desire out of it. Don't start asking how to be here and now. Don't start planning that \"I have to work hard to be here and now.\" You have moved away; that \"how\" takes you away.\nYou are your real nature. This is the great declaration of Zen. Other religions say you have to find God. Zen says you are. Other religions say long is the journey. Zen says there is no question of any journey whatsoever. You are already there! Maybe fast asleep, snoring, but you are there. The goal is where you are. You are the goal, you are the target.\nOsho - The First Principle 162\nChapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray\nYou want \"to experience truth and to live it in the world\". That's what you are already doing. Drinking tea you are living the truth. Talking to a friend you are living the truth. Going for a morning walk you are living the truth. Even being angry you are living the truth. How can it be otherwise?\nThe ordinary is the extraordinary, and the trivial is the profound. The samsara is nirvana.\nIt is just a question of remembering.\n\"... to become my real nature, to experience truth and to live it in the world\". That's what you are doing, Gunakar. Just the mind goes on playing a game. The mind says things can be better. The mind says life can be improved upon. The mind says there must be something more, you must be missing something -- seek, search, do something. This is greed, and the greed is so subtle that it can hide in millions of ways. It can even start trying not to be greedy.\nNow, listening to me, your mind will say, \"Right. Now I am not to be greedy at all because it is greed that is destroying my life. So I have to get rid of greed.\" Again the greed has come, from the back door.\n\"It was deep in the woods back yonder,\" began old Herman, the guide. \"I was plodding along minding my own business when suddenly a huge bear sneaked up behind me. He pinned my arms to my sides and started to squeeze the breath out of me. My gun fell out of my hands.\nFirst thing you know, the bear had stooped down, picked up the gun, and was pressing it against my back.\"\n\"What did you do?\" gasped the tenderfoot.\nOld Herman sighed. \"What could I do? I married his daughter.\" But the bear or the daughter, it makes no difference. It is the same.\nJust be aware of the ways of the greed. Don't try to get rid of it. Don't try to do anything.\nJust be aware of how greed takes a thousand and one forms. Watch it. There is no hurry.\nAnd you are not losing anything. You are living the truth. You cannot lose, in the very nature of things. We are all winners. Here nobody can be a loser. God has managed the world in such a way. That's why mystics say this i3 the most perfect world. God has managed it in such a way that everybody is a winner, nobody is a loser. Everybody is a victor, nobody is ever defeated. Even in your defeat there is victory, and even when you think you are lost you are not lost. It is all dream. The day you become awake you will find you have never been outside your home, you have always been there.\nThe only thing is to become more and more alert. Just watch. You see greed arising in one way, watch it. Don't try to stop it; otherwise it will arise in another way. It may choose just the opposite so it can deceive you. Don't do anything to it; otherwise it will find another way. No need to fight with it. Just watch it, let it be there. Watch it. See it naked, through and through.\nAwareness functions like an X-ray. It sees things through and through, and in that very seeing there is freedom. If you have seen the greed totally, in that very seeing greed disappears. Not that you make it disappear. It disappears. In that vision it is not found. In that light that darkness is no more there. Suddenly you are free of greed.\nOsho - The First Principle 163\nChapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray\nAnd when you are free of greed you know you have never left the home, you have always been there. You have never left God. Adam has never been expelled from the garden of Eden.\nHe still lives there; he just dreams that he has been expelled. This is the Zen interpretation of the biblical story.\nI must have given you a thousand interpretations about the story. The story is so beautiful.\nZen says Adam is still living in the garden of Eden. The snake has not tricked him into sin.\nThe snake has only tricked him into a dream. And God has not expelled him. How can God expel you? And to where can he expel you? It is all his garden. Where will you be? Wherever you will be it will be his garden, so to where can he expel you? And how can God expel?\nExpelling Adam, God will be expelling himself, a part of himself. He will fall into parts. No, it is not possible.\nThen what has happened? Adam has fallen asleep. Eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge, Adam has fallen asleep and is dreaming that God is very angry. It is his own dream. It is his own idea. It is his own guilt. It is his own mind, that \"I have broken the rule,\"\nthat \"I had promised, and I have broken my promise.\" Now he is trembling and feeling guilty, and in the sleep the guilt is creating a dream that God is very angry. He is projecting his guilt on God. His guilt is becoming God's anger, in his mind. Naturally God must be very angry, and he is expelling him, and he has expelled him. The gates are closed, and Adam is thrown into the world.\nBut it is just a dream. The moment Adam becomes awake, he will laugh. He will have an uproarious laugh. He will roll down on the ground. His belly will start bursting with the laughter because he will see the whole absurdity of it: he had never been out.\nHave you not dreamed dreams like this? In a dream you are being killed, and in that moment when you are being murdered, can you doubt it? It is so real. You shriek, you scream, and because of the shriek and the scream you become alert, you become aware. The dream is broken. Even after the dream your heart is beating louder, your breath is not in rhythm, your hands are shaking. You know now it was a dream, a nightmare, you are sitting in your bed and there is nobody, just your poor wife sleeping by your side -- no murderer -- the doors are closed, everything is silent, there has been nobody in the room, nobody was murdering you; but still you are trembling. The fear has been so deeply there, the idea of murder has penetrated so deeply in you, that even when you are awake, a little smoke of it continues to be there. But now you know you have never been out of the room and nobody is trying to murder you, there is nobody.\nThis is what I say to you. You are still in the garden of Eden. God has not expelled you.\nYou have fallen asleep.\nAnd the work of the Master is to bring you back. Back, not from anywhere, but only from sleep. Back to awareness.\nOsho - The First Principle 164\nChapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray Question\nWHY DO YOU TALK ONLY TO YOUR DISCIPLES? WHY NOT TO THE MASSES?\nThere is a beautiful Zen saying. Let that be the answer.\n\"I sing my songs to him who understands them. I drink my wine with the friend who knows me well.\"\nQuestion\nIT ALL SOUNDS SO GREAT, AS PERFECT AS CAN BE ARTICULATED. BUT\nWHAT THE HELL DO YOU DO IN THE MEANTIME?\nYou have missed. You have not understood what has been said to you. You have not heard. Again the greed has become a barrier. Listening to me you are listening through the greed.\nWhen you listen to me, if I am talking about enlightenment and the joy of it, you become greedy. You start thinking, \"When am I going to become enlightened?\" So you say it is great\n-- it all sounds great, \"as perfect as can be articulated\". Now, this greed creates a problem.\nYou put whatsoever I am saying as a goal. Of course, the goal is far away. There is a distance between you and the goal, and the distance has to be traveled, so the\nsecond question arises:\n\"What the hell do you do in the meantime?\"\nBut there is no meantime. I am not talking about the goal; I am talking about the way. And I am not saying anything about the future or afterlife; I am saying something about THIS\nmoment, this very moment! This is it! You think in terms of tomorrow. I am talking about today.\nJesus says to his disciples, \"Look in the field. Look at the beautiful lilies. They don't think of the morrow, they toil not, they labor not. Look at these beautiful flowers. They are just herenow. Even Solomon attired in all his costly clothes was not so beautiful. Look at these lilies in the field.\"\nI am talking about THIS moment. What do you mean by \"meantime\"? There is no meantime. This is it! These birds, this cuckoo, these trees, you and me: this moment. This is the moment of nirvana.\nBut you start thinking in terms of desire. You say, \"It sounds great.\" In fact, a thing that could have released your celebration becomes a desire, and through desire you start feeling sad because the goal is far away.\nThe cuckoo is singing right now. And the trees have flowered right now. It is all beautiful this moment. It will never be more beautiful. It has never been less beautiful. Each moment is perfect. But you start thinking about the tomorrow. Then the whole glory is there, somewhere away from you, and here you are a miserable creature, crying and weeping for the goal.\nYou create the meantime. I am not talking about the meantime. I am not talking about time at all, so what to say about meantime? I am talking about the eternal moment, about eternity.\nYou bring time in. The mind always brings time in. Time is a mind faculty. Osho - The First Principle\n165\nChapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray\nThe mind cannot be herenow. The mind says, \"Right. Hoard this, whatsoever Osho is saying. Hoard it. Someday we are going to practice it, and one day we are going to attain to this Buddhahood. It sounds great.\" Then the misery, then the sadness. Then you will remain miserable your whole life. This Buddhahood will never happen, because you missed it in the first place.\nYou have become so miserable that you cannot trust me that the celebration is possible right now. You say, \"First one has to prepare. First one has to become this and that. First one has to meditate. First one has to become a great saint. First one has to become virtuous.\" This is something which from the very childhood has been deeply conditioned on your mind.\nThe parents, the teachers, the schools, the universities, the priest, the politician, they all have been teaching you, \"Get ready. Get ready; something is going to happen.\" And then you go on getting ready -- and one day you simply die, just getting ready. It never happens. When you were a child they were saying, \"Wait, grow up, first be educated. Go to the university, come back home.\" Thrilled, you go to the university and you suffer all sorts of tortures there, in the hope that it is not going to last forever, in the hope that now you are getting ready. You don't know what for, what you are getting ready for.\nTo listen to this cuckoo singing? To watch a bird on the wing? To see a full moon in the night? To hold a friend's hand? To love? For what? Because all this is available right now.\nYou go to the university, you go through a thousand and one imprisonments; by the time you come back home you are destroyed. It is very rare; very fortunate people come back from the university without being destroyed by the education system.\nThen they come home. Then the father says, \"Now find a job -- and get ready. Get married, and get ready. Then everything is going to be beautiful.\" And you read the novels and you go to the movie and you see the film, and once the marriage happens, the story says, \"Ever afterwards they lived in happiness.\" Have you ever seen anybody living after marriage and happy? But these stories circulate, they condition the mind: Get ready.\nSo one day you find a job. Another humiliation. One day you get married.\nAnother distraction from the moment. And so on, so forth. Then you go on missing, it is not happening, so somebody says, \"How can you have it unless you have a child?\" Right. So get ready, have a child. And so on, so forth.\nFinally you recognize the fact that the whole life has been a wastage.\nI am not saying don't go to the university, and I am not saying don't get married, I am not saying don't get a job. Please, don't misunderstand me. What I am saying is: For happiness don't get ready, it is already here. Go to the university. Enjoy. Have a job, but enjoy it. It is not going to lead to happiness. Each moment is an end unto itself; it is not to be converted into a means towards something else. Love, and enjoy love. Don't think that you will be happy while you are married. Get married, and BE happy. Don't think that when you will have a child and you will become a mother or a father then you will be happy. Have you not seen your mother and your father? So what are you hoping for? And don't wait and don't go on postponing.\nThe greatest calamity that has happened to humanity is postponement -- always postponing. There are people who are always looking at the timetable and thinking about where to go on the holidays, what trains to catch and what planes to go by, this place or that, to the Himalayas or to the Alps, to Kashmir or to Switzerland. And they are always preparing and preparing, and they never go. What will you say about these people? You will think they Osho - The First Principle\n166\nChapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray\nare mad. They have all the guidebooks and all the maps of the world and all the literature that government information services go on publishing. They have a whole library, and they go on looking into it and they go on preparing, but they always prepare and they never go. What will you think about them? Will you not call them neurotic?\nThis is what the situation is with everybody. You always talk about God, you always talk about MOKSHA, nirvana, heaven, paradise, you always talk about it, but it is always tomorrow. So you have to prepare. \"Meantime\" you prepare.\nI am saying there is no meantime. God is available right now, just for the asking.\nStart enjoying. Don't ask how to dance! Start dancing. Can't you move your body? It may not be very graceful. So who bothers? It may not be a trained, disciplined thing. So who bothers? Start dancing. Don't go on consulting manuals about love. Start loving. Don't go on and on in the mind. Start moving into existence, be existential. That is the message of Zen.\nQuestion\nOSHO, ARE YOU REALLY CRAZY?\nHow can I be crazy? I have no mind out of which to go. Question\nAS SIN CAN BE DEFINED AS \"MISSING THE MARK\", COULD ONE DEFINE ZEN\nAS \"HITTING THE MARK\"?\nThe question is from Yoga Anando.\nNo. Sin means missing the mark. Zen means there is no mark to miss. There is nothing, no target. There is no destiny. It is all beautiful purposelessness. It is all beautiful meaninglessness. It is a song. It has no meaning. It has a rhythm, but no meaning. It has tremendous beauty in it, but no logic. And it is not a syllogism; there is no conclusion. It is an unconcluded existence, and it remains always unconcluded.\nWe are always in the middle. There has been no source, and there is no goal.\nSin exactly means missing the mark. That's why Zen people don't talk about sin. Christians talk about sin, because they think God has to be achieved, heaven has to be achieved, there is some goal. If you miss that goal, that is what is called sin; sin means missing the goal. Zen people don't talk about sin. The word \"sin\" exists not for them, because there is no goal to miss. You are already at it! The arrow has reached, the arrow has always been there, not for a single moment has it been otherwise. Zen is so profound. It gives you utter freedom to be. It does not yoke you to some ideology and doesn't yoke you into some guilt.\nThe moment you talk about sin, guilt arises. The moment you start thinking you\nare missing the mark, tension arises, anxiety arises, anguish arises: \"So how not to miss?\" Then there is great trembling, and then the fear you may go on missing. Who knows? -- for so long you have been missing. So who knows, you may go on missing. You may go astray.\nOsho - The First Principle 167\nChapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray\nChristianity talks in terms of duality. You are separate from God, so you can miss him, you can move in a wrong direction, you can go astray. Zen is nondual. It says you are in God, you cannot go astray. See the beauty of it. See the great declaration. See the declaration of freedom\n-- utter freedom.\nFreedom from the goal is utter freedom because the goal keeps you tied together in a direction. Zen has no direction. When you have a direction to move in, you will have to choose where to go. And the fear will always remain, whether you are going in the right direction or not. Who knows? -- even your leader may be wrong. The one who is leading you may himself be misguided or may be a cheat. Who knows? And if you come close to your priest and your leader, you will become more suspicious.\nGurdjieff used to say that if you want to get rid of religion, live near the priests. Then you will get rid of religion because you will see they are trembling as much as you are trembling.\nTheir public faces are different, their private faces are different. Live close to a priest, and you will be surprised. He is as much in the dark as anybody else. He just pretends. He is as blind as anybody else, but he goes to the masses and pretends to the blind people that \"I have eyes.\"\nAnd all religions depend on priests. Why don't the priests say the truth? They cannot, because their whole trade depends on one secret, that they have to go on pretending that they have eyes. That pretension is very basic to the trade of the priest.\nAnd one priest may fight against another priest -- the Hindu priest may say something against Christianity and the Christian priest may say something about Hinduism -- but they never say anything against priesthood. Never.\nI have heard a beautiful anecdote. Meditate over it.\nThe little island in the South Pacific was in an uproar when the American missionary visited the chief of the tribe. \"What is the commotion?\" demanded the missionary.\n\"There is a white baby born in the village,\" replied the savage, \"and you know we don't like no man messing around with our women. Since you is the only white man on the island they is fixing to fry you alive.\"\nThe missionary was in a state of nervous collapse when he spied a flock of sheep on the hillside behind the village. Turning to the chief he cried, \"Look there on the hillside, chief, you see that flock of white sheep?\"\n\"I sure do,\" replied the chief.\n\"Well,\" said the missionary. \"Do you see the black sheep in the middle of the flock?\"\n\"I see it,\" responded the chief.\n\"There is no other black sheep and there never has been, has there?\" \"Well?\"\n\"Well.\"\nThe chief beckoned the missionary aside and whispered in his ear, \"You not tell, me not tell.\"\nOsho - The First Principle 168\nChapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray\nThis is how it goes on. They have to protect each other. They may fight about\ndogmas, they may fight about principles, philosophies, that is all okay. But they never say anything against the priesthood. The Shankaracharya of Puri will be as much in favour of the priesthood as the Vatican Pope. There will be no problem about that, no conflict about that. If priesthood is at stake, they will all fight for it.\nWhen Buddha declared these ultimate truths in India, there were many religions in India.\nThey all went against him. Not only Hindus, Jainas were against him. Not only Jainas, Ajeevekas were against him. And so many others. Why? Whenever a real man is there, all priests will be against him because the real man will bring the message to you that you are being led by blind people: they don't know; you don't know. The blind are leading the blind.\nZen says there is no need to be led by anybody, because there is nowhere to go. This is Cutting the very root of priesthood. Look at it. This is destroying priesthood totally. Zen does not say that one priest is right and another is wrong. If it is said that way, then priesthood is still protected. Zen says there is nowhere to go.\nA man came to Nansen and asked, \"What do you say? Is Zen the right way to achieve God?\" Nansen said, \"Zen is not a way at all, it is not a path, because a path leads somewhere.\nWe don't lead. A path reaches somewhere. We don't lead you anywhere. We simply throw you to where you are. We simply throw you back to yourself.\"\nIf it is a path, then leaders will be there. If something has to be done, then you will find people mediating between you and God, between you and reality. Nothing has to be done, so nobody has to show and guide you. You alone are enough.\nZen is not \"hitting the mark\". Zen is knowing that there is no mark and nowhere to hit, that you are the target, and the arrow has always been in the target.\nYou must have heard the great Tibetan mantra \"AUM MANE PADME HUM\". It has many meanings. One meaning is \"Look! The arrow is already in the target.\" AUM is just a shout, so that you can look; it is almost \"See!\" \"Look!\" -- \"Aum! mane padme hum.\" Literally it means \"jewel in the lotus\" \"mane padme hum\".\nJewel in the lotus. Literally it means \"Look!\nThe jewel is already in the lotus.\" Metaphorically it means \"Look! The arrow has already reached the target.\"\nYou are at home already, so it is not \"hitting the mark\", because \"hitting the mark\" will again be the same thing. Then you will ask, \"How to hit it?\" Then one has to learn archery, then one has to go through discipline, and then the whole priesthood comes in from the back door.\nI have heard:\nOne summer's day when a man in a rowing boat caught a cramp and fell into the water -- it was an ornamental lake -- arms and legs wildly flailing, he screamed, \"Help, Help! I can't swim!\" Finally a bystander shouted back, \"Stand up, you bloody fool!\" The drowning man did so -- and found that the water just came up to his waist.\nBut he was thinking he was drowning. The water just came up to his waist. You are not drowning. Just stand up!\nOsho - The First Principle 169\nChapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray\nI have heard another story. A traveler lost his track one night in the hills. It was a dark night, and he was very much afraid. The hills were very tricky and dangerous and the track was very narrow, and he was afraid he could miss a step and could disappear forever in the valley. He could fall into any abyss; they were all around. So he was just creeping on his hands. Still he fell, he slipped. He caught hold in time of the roots of a tree. Now, he was very much afraid. He tried hard somehow to get out of that hole he was hanging in, but he could not. And it was getting colder and colder and his hands started becoming frozen, and now he was certain that it was a question of minutes. Once the hands are too cold, he would not be able to hold onto the roots, and he would die. That became certain. Now there was no way to escape.\nHe started crying and weeping, and he started praying, and he had never been a theist, but in such moments nobody bothers about principles. He started saying to God, \"Save me,\" this and that, and \"I will not do this sin or that sin, and I will be straight now; I will not drink and I will not smoke,\" and all sorts of things he was promising. But no help came, and by and by his hands started slipping, and a moment came when he thought, \"Now it is finished.\" And he fell.\nAnd to his surprise, he was standing on his feet. There was no abyss there; it was just plain ground. For hours he was hanging between life and death.\nOnce you stop planning, you will suddenly be on plain ground. Once you stop thinking about the target and how to hit it, you will be at home. Zen says drop all ways, because all ways lead astray, because to God there is no need of any way. He is there in your heart. It is he who is listening to me, it is he who is talking to you. It is he who is breathing in you, it is he who is beating in your heart. God is not far away. God is not even outside. God is the innermost core of you.\nSo drop this sin-oriented idea of hitting or missing. Both are in the same category; both will create anxiety.\nMy whole effort here is to make you free of anxiety, free of guilt. Free of guilt, free of anxiety, you are a saint, because you are innocent then, you are a child again. You are born again.\nQuestion\nYOU CONFUSED ME VERY MUCH BY SAYING THAT THE SAMSARA IS THE\nNIRVANA. NOW, FROM WHERE TO BEGIN?\nThere is no need to begin. I am not sending you on a journey. Not even the first step is needed. Take the step, and you have moved in the wrong direction. It is not that any direction is wrong; all directions are wrong. Movement is wrong. It is not that a few people go astray and a few don't, no. All going is going astray.\nLet this sink in your heart as deeply as possible.\nWhen I say the world is samsara, I mean don't divide into the profane and the profound.\nLive the profound in a profound way, live the profane in a profound way. Don't divide into the material and the spiritual. Live the material in a spiritual way; bring the quality of the spirit to matter.\nOsho - The First Principle 170\nChapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray\nWhat do I mean when I say live in the ordinary world? I mean live the profane life in a new way, with a new being, with a new style, with a new flavor, the flavor of meditation.\nI am not telling you to go away anywhere.\nI am for God, but I am not against anything. And God, my God, is so vast, he includes all.\nYes, you can sip your tea in such a meditative way that it becomes prayer. Try it. You can love your woman in such a meditative way that love becomes ecstasy, that when you are lost with your woman or with your man, suddenly you are lost in God. Those moments become of tremendous value. Those moments become the first glimpses of divinity.\nStart living your ordinary life in an extraordinary way. What is the extraordinary way? To bring awareness. Whatsoever you do, let it be soaked in awareness, let it be showered with awareness.\nQuestion\nWHAT IS MATURITY? HOW CAN I BE MATURE?\nYou will have to understand first what immaturity is. That will give you the idea of what maturity is. Immaturity has a few ingredients in it. One, immaturity is a sort of dependence. A child depends on the parents; he is immature. If you are still depending, you are immature.\nYou may depend on God or you may depend on me, but it is immaturity. You are still seeking your parents. Maybe your parents are gone and lost; now you are\nprojecting your parents.\nThere are many people who come to me and I can see immediately in their eyes they are searching for their father. It is not accidental that the pope is called the pope. \"Pope\" means\n\"papa\". People are looking for a divine daddy, continuously. This is immaturity.\nWhen are you going to stand on your own feet? How long are you going to remain a dependent on the mother, on the father, on this and that?\nThese dependent people are very dangerous people because they can be exploited easily.\nAnybody who pretends to be their father, they will become victims to him. They will follow Adolf Hitler; the fuhrer will become their father. The Germans used to call their country the\n\"fatherland\", others call their countries the \"motherland\", but it is all the same nonsense. We go on projecting. The country becomes the mother, the country becomes the father, or God the Father, or Kali the Mother. You go on projecting.\nYou want to remain a child; you don't want to grow. Growth is responsibility, and you don't want to take any responsibility.\nPeople come to me and they say, \"Osho, we surrender to you. Now you are responsible.\"\nHow can I be responsible for you? Surrender can only mean that you have come to me to learn responsibility. Now you want to avoid responsibility. Surrendering to me can only be a way, a means, to learn to be responsible. But if you want surrender as a substitute for responsibility, your surrender is wrong, ill. It is not healthy, it is dangerous. And then you will start getting angry at me. If nothing is happening you will get angry. Because nothing is happening, you will think I am not doing anything.\nOnly you can do something. I can indicate, but the real thing is going to happen within you. Nobody else can do it. If I can do it, then I can undo it also. That will not be much of a Osho - The First Principle\n171\nChapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray\ngain. If Buddha can deliver you from your ignorance, then one day if he gets angry with you he will release all your ignorance again, back to you. That will not be of much use. Freedom is possible only when you learn responsibility, when you start standing on your own feet.\nOf course, one feels very helpless. So what? It is how life is. That helplessness is not bad.\nIt teaches you that ego is wrong, that you have to be humble, helpless. And yet there is no other way to stand: you can stand only on your own feet. Nobody can take you on his shoulders to God. You will have to enter into divinity on your own.\nSo maturity has to be understood through understanding immaturity. First thing: we are taught to be dependent on the parents, on the leaders, on the priests. Nobody wants you to be free, because people are afraid, the society is afraid, of free people. Free people will be rebellious. Free people will start doing THEIR thing, and the society is very much afraid of such people. The society wants you to do things that the society wants. The society wants you to follow a certain pattern. The society has its own goals; they have to be fulfilled. The society does not want you to become a Buddha or a Christ, because they have always been dangerous people. The society wants just zombies. And an immature person can easily become a zombie because he is an imitator.\nHave you watched small children imitating, and by imitation they think they are becoming grown-ups? Small children start smoking. Not that they feel very good about smoking, not that it is great or anything. When a child starts smoking he cannot even believe why people smoke, because his eyes start getting red, his throat feels irritated, and he starts coughing, tears come down his cheeks. It is really painful, but he will tolerate the pain because the cigarette gives a certain feeling that he is a grown-up. Only grown-ups are allowed to smoke, so the smoking becomes a symbol of grown-upness.\nI have heard:\nA man walking down the street noticed a small boy about ten years old sitting on\nthe front doorstep of a house, smoking a cigarette. \"Aren't you a little young to be smoking?\" he asked.\n\"Of course I ain't,\" replied the lad. \"I got a girlfriend and all.\" \"A girlfriend!\" said the man.\n\"Yeah, Picked her up last night, I did. Smashing it was.\" \"Good Lord! How old was she?\"\n\"I dunno. I was too drunk to ask her.\"\nThere are symbols of grown-upness. You need to have a girlfriend, you have to smoke, you have to drink, and even small children start learning these tricks. And then they never grow up, They only imitate, They imitate other, false grownups. And their children will imitate them, and so on it goes.\nThis world is a world of imitators, monkeys all. And it does not make much difference --\nyou can be a chairman of the board of monkeys, that doesn't make much difference; or you can be a president of a monkey country, that doesn't make any difference -- all the same you remain the monkey. Maybe you are more monkeyish than others.\nOsho - The First Principle 172\nChapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray\nA grown-up person is one who does not imitate, who starts feeling his own way, who starts being in his own way, who starts looking into his nature: \"Who am I? And what REALLY do I feel?\"\nOne woman came home, driving, she got out of her car, and fell down flat on the ground.\nThe husband rushed, asked, \"What is the matter? What happened? Why did you\nfaint?\"\nShe said, \"It was too hot.\"\nThe husband looked at the car and he said, \"But why didn't you open the windows?\"\nShe said, \"What! Open the windows, and let the neighbours know that our car is not air conditioned?\"\nOne can die but cannot allow the neighbours to know that the car is not air conditioned.\nShe had to keep the windows closed. She was fainting, but that is okay, but to keep the windows open hurts much more.\nListen to your being. It is continuously giving you hints; it is a still, small voice. It does not shout at you, that is true. And if you are a little silent you will start feeling your way. Be the person you are. Never try to be another, and you will become mature. Maturity is accepting the responsibility of being oneself, whatsoever the cost. Risking all to be oneself, that's what maturity is all about.\nIf you imitate you will again and again fall into a ditch because whatsoever you imitate never fits reality. Reality is continuously changing, it is a flux, nothing is ever the same. It is a river; it goes on flowing.\nIf you imitate your father ... Just see, your father lived many years before. Your father was a child maybe thirty years before or forty years before. He learned things in a different world.\nFor example, your father, when he was a child, was not sitting five hours glued to the chair before the TV. Now, you don't know how much the TV has done to the small children. The father does not know. His childhood was not at all influenced by the TV. Five hours sitting before a TV is no ordinary phenomenon.\nIn fact, before TV happened, down the centuries, people had never looked into a source of light for five hours continuously. Now the scientists say that the whole nervous system changes because of those five hours of looking directly into the source of light. The TV goes on throwing strong rays on your eyes. It has never happened before. Five hours is too much.\nScientists may if you sit near a color TV, four feet away, you will get cancer, you will suffer from many diseases which your parents had not known, ever. The eyes are eighty percent of your life. Five hours of just strong light rays reaching into your head -- your sleep will be disturbed. If America suffers from insomnia, it is natural. The TV is one of the basic causes.\nOrdinarily man has lived with light, natural light. In a primitive society, the sun rises, people rise, and the sun sets and people set, people go to sleep. A natural rhythm with light.\nNow we are living too much with the light; the eyes are not made for that much light. The inner nervous system is disturbed; it becomes too loaded.\nAnd a thousand and one things will happen. In America a new phenomenon is happening.\nMany places it has happened, and people have become really worried about it, what to do? In one place a woman was murdered, and twenty persons were standing there, almost paralyzed, not doing anything. A psychological investigation was done. What is the matter? Twenty young, healthy people standing there, and a woman was killed just in front of them and they Osho - The First Principle\n173\nChapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray\ndidn't do anything -- they didn't even shout, they didn't call the police. What happened? And you will be surprised. The finding is that it is because these twenty people have lived on TV\nfor too long.\nOn the TV screen murder happens so many times. What do you do? You don't do anything; you remain glued to your chair. They have become accustomed to it. It was another TV scene. They have lost track of reality. The TV has become more real. For five hours you are not with anything else -- and a continuous bombardment of light, and strong light, and things are moving in your head. You become a watcher. They were standing there just glued to their spots, paralyzed -\n- just watching. They could not do anything, because they are no more doers.\nNow, your father, who had a different kind of childhood, will not be able to understand it.\nYou are living in a different world, in a world which is more of TV watchers than of participants. Whatsoever he says will not be fit for your world; hence the generation gap. The father speaks a different language, you speak a different language. You live in a different world, he lived in a different world. Now, those two worlds never coincide.\nIf you are an imitator you will always be taking false moves. You have to learn to live in YOUR world; you have to respond to the reality that surrounds you. Things have changed dramatically. They have always been changing, but the change has been too fast in this century. And it will be faster and faster.\nYou have to become aware of the situation and respond accordingly. An experienced plumber was giving instructions to his apprentice.\n\"Working in other people's homes,\" he said, \"can sometimes lead to embarrassing situations, but you can always get out of them by using tact. For example, the other day, I walked into a bathroom and found a lady taking a bath. I backed out saying, 'Excuse me, sir.'\nIn that way, the lady thought I had not gotten a good look at her and it was all right.\"\nThe following afternoon, the apprentice staggered into the office in a beat-up condition.\n\"What happened to you?\" asked the boss.\n\"You and your tact,\" cried the apprentice. \"I went to the bridal suite of the Etter Plaza Hotel to fix a faucet. I was halfway through the bedroom before I realized there was a couple making love in the bed. The husband cussed at me, but I remember what you had said, so I tipped my hat and said, 'Excuse me, gentlemen!'\"\nIf you simply follow and you don't understand, you are immature. Never follow. Try to understand. Let understanding be your basic law of life. Let things come out of your understanding, not out of your memory.\nThe immature person functions through memory. Whenever there is a situation he looks into his memory, into his past, and finds a clue. The mature person looks into the situation, puts his past aside, because the past is irrelevant. He brings his total attention to the present situation and functions out of that totality. His action is in the present. The immature person is always living through his past; the immature person is always turning his future into his past.\nHe is repetitive, he is parrotlike, he is a shadow, a reflection. He is not real. Osho - The First Principle\n174\nChapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray\nWhen a party of tourists climbed to the top of a famous echoing mountain, they saw an old man, sitting on a rock, an enormous telescope in his hands. Every few moments he let out a series of shouts.\nThe puzzled tourists watched him for some time. Then one of them went up to the old man and asked, \"Why do you keep looking through that thing and then calling out as if you were in pain?\"\nThe old man-answered impatiently, \"Don't talk to me. You will distract my attention and I will lose my job. I am the echo for this hill.\"\nMany people have become just echoes. Watch yourself when something happens and you react. Are you reacting the same way as your father used to react in such a situation? Are you saying the same thing as your mother would have said if she were in this situation? Are your gestures the same as your teacher's in the school you loved so much? Just watch -- your gestures, your words, your actions -- and you will be surprised. Ninety-nine percent they are just echoes, they are not true.\nHow can you be fulfilled with such echoes?\nYour father is living through you, not you. Your parents are living through you, not you.\nYour parents' parents are living through you, not you. The whole of humanity and its past is living through you, but not you. This is immaturity.\nMaturity means you discontinue with your past. With one stroke of the sword you become discontinuous with your past and your heritage and the tradition, and you start living independently. The gesture is yours; then it is meaningful, then it is full of significance, then it is not an empty gesture. The words are yours, not borrowed, not somebody else's; then your life becomes more and more authentic and real.\nTo live in immaturity is to live in a kind of dream. It is a shadow world. Your eyes are so full of fog, you don't have clarity.\nA frustrated young man went to see his doctor.\n\"Doc,\" he explained, \"every night I have the strangest dreams. Beautiful blondes, brunettes, and redheads appear, and one by one they try to kiss me and put their arms around me.\"\n\"So?\" answered the doctor.\n\"So nothing, Doc. I keep pushing them away -- every one of them.\" \"What would you like me to do?\"\n\"Doc, please,\" pleaded the patient, \"break my arms.\"\nPeople are living in their dreams. They are ready to break their real arms for their unreal dreams.\nWatch! You will find many times the same happening in your life. You are ready to kill your reality for some unreal ideal, some utopia, some ideology, some scripture. Somebody insults the Bible. Are you ready to fight? Then you are a fool. Somebody says something Osho - The First Principle\n175\nChapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray\nagainst Ram, and you are Hindu and you are ready to be killed or kill. Then you are a fool.\nThen you are living in shadows and you have become too attached to shadows.\nIn fact, a really alert man will not feel offended even if somebody insults him personally.\nEven if somebody says something against his name, he will not feel offended, because he will know, \"I am not my name. The name is just an appendage, a label -- useful, but not real, just a make-believe. Any other name would be the same.\" He will not feel offended.\nA really alert man, even if you hit his body, will not feel offended, because he will know he is not the body. He will know he is not his mind. He will know that he is something transcendental, and he will remain in that transcendentalness. In that transcendence is his being.\nThen life will have a totally new quality and it will become a new experience. That experience is divine. Maturity is the door to divinity. Immature, you remain asleep. Mature, you become awake.\nThe question is from Prem Anam. He has many things which are immature in him. His question is relevant, relevant to his being, and it is good that he has asked.\nNow, Anam, watch, become more careful. Drop your childishness more and more.\nI say again and again, I quote again and again, Jesus' saying that \"Unless you are like a child, you will not enter into my kingdom of God.\" But remember, he does not mean childishness. Childishness is just the opposite of being LIKE a child. A childish person is never like a child. He pretends to be a grown-up; he is a pretender. A childlike person is one who has become so mature, so alive, so aware, that he drops all pretensions. He is nude and naked, he is true, he is innocent.\nDrop childishness, and become a child; and you will be mature. And you will be ready, ready to take the jump into yourself.\nQuestion\nI SEEM TO BE MORE INTERESTED IN HELPING OTHERS REACH ENLIGHTENMENT THAN REACHING IT MYSELF; HAVING GRASPED\nIT\nINTELLECTUALLY. I LOSE NO OPPORTUNITY OF TALKING ABOUT IT. THE EASE, THE JOY, THE PEACE, AND THE ENERGY THAT I FEEL MAKE ME BELIEVE THAT\nI AM ON THE RIGHT TRACK. BUT AM I? OR SHOULD I BETTER BE SILENT\nTILL ...?\nThe question is from Ajit Saraswati.\nFor Ajit Saraswati it is perfectly right. He can continue. But remember, I am saying so only to him, not to anybody else. It is a very personal question.\nHe has nothing of the ego. He can go on. In fact, this too is part of his humbleness, that he has asked.\nIt is good to help others, because there is nobody really who is other. Helping others, you are helping yourself because we are parts of each other, members of one another. We are joined together. If I help you to be happy, I become happy. If I help you to be miserable, I Osho - The First Principle\n176\nChapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray\nbecome miserable. Our life is together here; it is a togetherness; we are not separate. On the periphery we may be separate; at the center we are one.\nNothing to be worried about. If you have the feeling that you enjoy sharing whatsoever you have understood, howsoever little it is, if you have the feeling that you enjoy, you feel blissful, you feel joyful -- and no ego arises out of it ... Let that be the criterion: if ego arises out of it, then you are not helping others, and you are destroying yourself meanwhile. If no ego arises --\nyou simply feel peaceful and silent and happy that you shared something with somebody, a grace descends on you -- then you are perfectly right. Then go on the housetops and shout.\nWhen you have, share it.\nAnd there is no need to wait, that when you have the whole of it, then you will share it.\nThen you will not have the whole, ever. Share it, and you will get more. Give it, and you will get more.\nBut remember only one thing: the ego should not enter in. The moment you see ego arising, the moment you see you are feeling great, superior to others, holier than others, then something is going wrong. Then it is better to wait. You are not to wait for the whole of God to happen to you, but you are to wait for the whole of the ego to go.\nWith Ajit Saraswati, it is already the case. The ego is not there. Slowly, slowly that rock has disappeared. I have been falling on him like a waterfall. Yes, the ego was there one day.\nAnd the water is very soft, so the rock never feels worried, but the water goes on falling, goes on falling, goes on falling, and by and by, unaware what is happening, the rock slowly, slowly disappears, becomes sand, and is taken far away.\nThe rock was there, but it is not there. So enjoy it, delight in it, rejoice, share. Question\nOSHO, CAN YOU GIVE ME TWO VERY FUNDAMENTAL RULES FOR THE\nSEEKERS?\nHere are two ancient rules, very ancient:\nFirst, that you must be like a man who has been bitten by a snake and knows he has not a moment to lose.\nAnd second, that you must be like a man who has awakened to find that his horse has been stolen and it is too late to lock the door and there is no hurry.\nQuestion\nOSHO, WHAT IS THE FIRST PRINCIPLE?\nIf I were to tell you, it would become the second principle.

Rukamani asks, "What is the matter? What happened? Where were you going
so suddenly, as if there was some emergency? And now suddenly you turn
back from the door and you are sad. What happened?"</p><p>Krishna says, "One of my lovers, one of my devotees, is passing
through a capital and people are throwing stones at him and blood is
flowing from his head and he has wounds, but he remains utterly helpless
-- not a condemnatory word on his lips, not even in his mind. His
surrender is total. I had to rush to help him. He was so helpless!"</p><p>Then Rukamani is even more surprised. "Then why did you come
back?"</p><p>Krishna says, "By the time I reached the door, he had taken a stone
in his own hand. Now he is ready to answer himself. Now I am not needed.
Now he is no more helpless."</p><p>Remember, all human help becomes a barrier to divine help. My purpose
here is to make you REALLY helpless, utterly helpless, so God rushes
towards you and fills your emptiness.</p><p>That will be the day of real rejoicing, ecstasy.</p><p>Don't ask for my help. Ask that I destroy all that you have arranged
around yourself as help, comfort, consolation. Ask that I kill you. Ask
that I behead you. The moment your head has rolled down on the earth,
you will grow a new head, and that head will be the divine. That will be
God's head.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 108</p><p>Chapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence 7</p><p>The Song of Sound and Silence</p><p>17 April 1977 am in Buddha Hall</p><p>A PUZZLED MONK ONCE SAID TO FUKETSU, "YOU SAY TRUTH CAN BE</p><p>EXPRESSED WITHOUT SPEAKING, AND WITHOUT KEEPING SILENT. HOW CAN</p><p>THIS BE?" FUKETSU ANSWERED, "IN SOUTHERN CHINA, IN THE SPRING, WHEN I
WAS ONLY A LAD, AH! HOW THE BIRDS SANG AMONG THE BLOSSOMS."</p><p>God IS. Truth IS. Love IS. There is no way to say it, and there is no
way to hide it. There is no word which can express it, and there is no
methodology of how to keep it unexpressed.</p><p>That is the dilemma of the mystic. He has to say it, and it cannot be
said. He cannot keep quiet about it, he cannot keep silent. It
overfloods him; it starts overflowing; it is beyond him to keep silent.
He has to say it, and nobody has ever been able to say it.</p><p>God is not a word, neither is truth a word, nor is love a word. And
they are not just silences either, because their isness is a singing
isness; they are songs. It is not just dull and dead there. It is full
of joy, it is overflowing joy. It is celebration, it is ecstasy, it is
orgasm, because it is a meeting of the opposites, because it is a
meeting of the polarities, because it is a marriage, a marriage of yin
and yang, day and night, summer and winter, life and death, sound and
silence.</p><p>So when it happens, you cannot say it, but you have to sing it, and
that is the beauty of the song. It has something of the word and
something of silence in it. That is the beauty of poetry, the beauty of
dance. Something is visible, something is invisible; the manifest and
the unmanifest meet there, embrace each other, are fulfilled in each
other.</p><p>If you simply say and use words and there is no silence in those
words, your words will be like dead stones. They can hit somebody's
head, you can argue with them, but you cannot convert. They don't have
that quality of silence which becomes conversion. When a word has a
silence at its innermost core, when a word is luminous with silence, it
brings conversion.</p><p>Then it is a gospel, then it is good news. Then somebody, who is
saying something with silence in it, is not throwing a dead rock at you,
but is throwing a flower. It will also hit you, but it will also caress
you, and it will go deeper because you can be vulnerable to it and it
will reach to your very heart. Because how can you protect yourself
against it? You will be nondefensive.</p><p>So remember, all the mystics have been singing and dancing,
celebrating. They go on saying, "We cannot say it," and they go on
saying all the same.</p><p>There is a difference in saying and saying. When you say without
knowing it, without realizing it, it is just gibberish, just words and
words and words, without any soul in them; it is a corpse; there is no
aliveness in it. Those words stink -- they stink of death. There is no
heartbeat of life. When you know, when you have experienced, when you
have fallen into that abyss called God, when you are transformed by that
surrender, when you are totally immersed in it, when your every cell is
bathed in it, then you say; but your words are not mere words.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 109</p><p>Chapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence</p><p>They carry silence. They are vehicles of silence; they are gestures
of silence. We have a special name for it in the East: MAHAMUDRA -- the
great gesture.</p><p>Look at my hand. If it is empty, if there is nobody behind it who has
experienced, then it is an ordinary gesture. But if there is somebody
behind it who has known, who has lived, who has experienced, then
raising this hand is a great gesture, MAHAMUDRA. Then the ordinary hand
becomes extraordinary. Then ordinary words are no more ordinary words.
You cannot go to the dictionary to find their meaning. When a word is
full of silence, you will have to go within yourself to find its
meaning, not to a dictionary, not to a library. You will have to go
within yourself. The meaning will be found in your experience.</p><p>The word of a man who knows is loaded, loaded with great fragrance.
You will have to decode it in your innermost core of being, into the
innermost shrine of your being.</p><p>Truth is a transcendence, transcendence of all duality. So those who
say truth</p><p>cannot be said, only say a half-truth; and those who say that truth
can be said only in silence, they also say a half-truth.</p><p>Zen brings the whole truth to the world. Zen is a great blessing to
the world; it brings the whole truth.</p><p>The whole truth is: Truth cannot be said, and yet can be said. If not
said, then showed, indicated. The ordinary duality is transcended. We
are always moving from one pole of the duality to the other. Sometimes
we say, "Yes, it can be said"; this is one pole. Then we become aware,
"How can it be said?" -- the other pole. Then we keep silent, but then
again we become aware that there is something left: "Yes, it can be
said." This way it goes on moving, it swings.</p><p>Zen says truth is a transcendence, transcendence of all duality. The
duality between the word and the silence is also to be transcended.</p><p>The Bible says in the beginning there was the word. The Vedas say in
the beginning there was silence, eternal silence, and the silence
brooded over the sea, and it was dark. And the Bible says there was the
word. The first thing that happened in existence was the word. God said
let there be light, and there was light. Both are half-truths.</p><p>If you ask the Zen people ... They have not written any Bible or any
Veda yet, and they will never try, because they don't believe in
scriptures. They say it is beyond the scriptures; it is a transmission
beyond the scriptures. But if they ever write a Bible, or if they are
forced to, like Lao Tzu was once forced to write the Tao Te Ching
because the king wouldn't allow him to leave the country unless he wrote
his experiences ...</p><p>Lao Tzu wanted to go to the Himalayas, to die there; certainly there
cannot be any more beautiful a place to die. Those eternal peaks, those
snow -- covered virgin peaks, where can you find a better place to
disappear in God? What better moment? He wanted to go -- he was very old
and he wanted to go to the Himalayas to rest and disappear there, nobody
ever knowing about him. He wanted to disappear absolutely alone. He
wanted his death to be private.</p><p>And death is a private thing. Nobody else can be with you when you
die; it is absolutely internal. So he wanted to escape and go away from
the crowds. He was afraid too many people will surround him and his
death will become a public affair.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 110</p><p>Chapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence</p><p>But the king insisted, "First you write whatsoever you have known."
And he ordered the guards on the boundary saying that "This man is not
to be allowed to go out." So he was caught at a guard post, and for
three days he sat in the guards' room and wrote down the Tao Te
Ching.</p><p>If somebody, forces a Zen Master to write down a Bible, a Veda, then
they will say there was song in the beginning. Neither word nor silence,
but song. There was song in the beginning, and God sang and danced. Not
"Let there be light": God sang and danced. And that dance became the
beginning of creation.</p><p>That dance continues. That dance is what existence is.</p><p>The song has a mystery about it because it is a meeting, a marriage
of opposites. In the song there is sound and silence. The song says
something, but says in such a way that you cannot grasp it. Not that it
doesn't say anything. It makes much available, but you cannot grasp it,
you cannot just possess it. If you try to possess, you will kill it. You
cannot have a song in your fist; otherwise the song will be killed. It
is too delicate; you cannot be that rough with it.</p><p>A song has to be preserved in the heart, not in the fist. About a
song you have to be receptive, not aggressive. You can keep an argument
in the fist; it is hard, rocklike, it will not die. You can keep and
possess an argument, you can become the possessor of an argument. That's
why the ego enjoys very much to have arguments, proofs, logic,
philosophies. The ego feels very much fulfilled: "I know so much."</p><p>The song cannot be possessed that way; the ego cannot be its
possessor. The song can penetrate your being, but the ego has to give
way. If the ego comes in between, the song will be shattered. You may
get fragments of it, and you may start interpreting those fragments, but
you will miss the unity of it. And it was in the unity.</p><p>A song has not to be thought about. If you start thinking, about a
song, you are already missing it. When you listen to music, how do you
listen? Do you bring</p><p>your mind in? If you bring your mind in, where is the music? Music
and the mind both cannot exist together. That is the mystery of music:
you have to put your mind aside. You cannot argue with music; you cannot
nod your head in agreement or disagreement. You cannot say, "Yes, I
agree," or "No, I don't agree." There is no question of agreement or no
agreement. With music you simply become one. If you want to feel it you
have to put your head aside. The heart has to open towards it. It goes
directly to the heart, it showers on the heart. It helps the flower of
the heart to open and bloom. It is a nourishment for the inner
lotus.</p><p>The Zen people will say, "There was song in the beginning, and then
God sang and God danced, and that's what he has been doing since then."
Each moment it is a dance. Look around. Can't you hear these birds?
These are not birds; don't be deceived by them. These are not birds. It
is God singing, the God of the beginnings -- because it is always a
beginning.</p><p>Each moment is a beginning. Never think that the beginning was
somewhere in the past. This is the beginning, and it is always the
beginning and there is no end. It is God singing.</p><p>Can't you hear the silence of the trees? It is God, silent.</p><p>In the birds he is singing, in the trees he is silent. Birds cannot
exist without the trees, and, let me tell you, the trees cannot exist
without the birds either. The birds sing for the trees, and the trees
are silent for the birds, and there is a marriage. They are tied
together. If trees disappear, birds will disappear. Kill all the birds
of the world, and you will one day see the trees are disappearing.
Everything is intertwined, everything is interlinked. This is what we
mean by the word "ecology" -- everything is together.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 111</p><p>Chapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence It is God singing, it is
God silent.</p><p>Once you understand that God is both, then this highest possibility
opens for you. This is the first principle, that you need not divide,
all division is false, that</p><p>you need not create any duality, because existence is nondual,
because existence is one.</p><p>And all our misery is because we are divided. Why do you feel so
thrilled when you are in love? What happens? Is the thrill just
chemical, hormonal? No, it is not. The thrill is existential. When you
are in love, at least with one person you feel to be one, at least with
one person you have dropped duality, at least with one person you are no
more separate, at least with one person the boundaries are not there.
You have removed the boundaries. Two spaces have come so close, they
overlap. You feel so thrilled with love, so blissful with love, because
it is an experience of God, a very limited experience of course.</p><p>And if it is so beautiful to be one with one person, how much more
beautiful will it be to be one with the whole, to be one with all the
persons, men and women, trees and birds and animals and the clouds and
the mountains and the stars? How will it be? How much more beautiful?
The beauty cannot be imagined, because the difference will not be only
of quantity, it will be of quality. It will be utterly different.</p><p>Love can at the most be only a glimpse of a ray, not the ray itself,
but only a glimpse in the lake. A ray of the sun playing on the lake,
and you see the glimpse. That glimpse is love.</p><p>When you find out the real ray, it becomes prayer. When you start
moving through that ray, upwards, you start climbing on that ray and you
start reaching towards the source of all light, then you are growing in
spirituality. One day you are dissolved into that light. You yourself
have become that light. That is the orgasm I talk about. That's
ecstasy.</p><p>And Zen people say that when you know, you have to say, knowing well
that it cannot be said. You have to sing it.</p><p>Zen Masters have been very creative. Either they were singers,
dancers, or painters, or in some sort of art, calligraphy, pottery.
Whatsoever they could do they did. That became the gesture of their
expression. They were not inactive people. Deep down they were not
doers, and on the surface they were not inactive at all. Deep down they
were just instrumental to the divine. No doer, no idea of doing anything
-- just being, but on the surface very creative. The world would have
been far richer if every religion had developed such a school as
Zen.</p><p>For example, Hindu monks have lived a very uncreative life. Jaina
monks have lived a very uncreative life. Except Zen, even Buddhists have
lived a very uncreative life. So has been the case with the
Catholics.</p><p>Zen brings creativity. And remember, if you want to be one with the
creator, you will have to learn some ways of creativity. The only way to
be one with the creator is to be in some moment of creativity, when you
are lost. The potter is lost in making his pottery; the potter is lost
while working on the wheel. The painter is lost while painting. The
dancer is lost; there is no dancer, only the dance remains. Those are
the peak moments, where you touch God, where God touches you.</p><p>Now, the scholar, the so-called scholar, becomes wordy. He goes on
learning more words, more words, more information, more scriptures. He
has no silence. That is a very lopsided phenomenon. Then against the
scholar there are a few saints, who keep quiet; they don't even say a
single word. That too is moving to the other extreme. They become
uncreative. Of course, they are silent, better than the scholar -- at
least they will not throw their rubbish into Osho - The First
Principle</p><p>112</p><p>Chapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence</p><p>other people's heads, at least they are not committing any crime --
but in a higher sense they are also criminals because they are not
benefiting existence. They are parasites. They are not making existence
richer by their being here. They are not helping God in his dance, in
his song.</p><p>Zen brings the highest synthesis. Don't be afraid of speaking, but
don't go on speaking if you don't know. Don't be silent. Just being
silent will not help.</p><p>It has to be understood because too many times this comes to your
mind too: Why go on speaking? Why not keep quiet? But your silence will
be YOUR silence. The words will go on moving, revolving inside you. You
will become a madhouse inside. You may look silent from the outside; you
will not be silent inside. How can you simply drop those words, those
old habits of many lives? The mind will go on chattering, the mind will
go on saying things, repeating things. The mind is like an automaton;
even if you don't want to talk the mind goes on. If you don't talk to
others it goes on talking to itself. It creates both the</p><p>parties: it talks from one side and answers from another side; it
goes on playing the game. From the outside one can be easily silent, but
from the inside?</p><p>And if you are silent from the inside, you will be surprised that
your silence becomes so loaded with ecstasy that you have to sing. There
is no other way. That you have to dance, that you have to share. When
you have you have to share. If you have it at all you will have to
share. If you don't have it you can keep quiet, but what is the point of
keeping quiet if you don't have it?</p><p>There are two types of people: one who goes on talking without having
it, and one who goes on keeping silent without having it. Both are in
the same boat.</p><p>There is a third type of person, who has come to know it, who has
really become silent and in the silence he has heard the soundless
sound, in the silence God has delivered his message to him. God has
spoken to him. He has had a dialogue with God himself. The silence has
filled his heart with so much juice, with so much life, with life
abundant, that he is bursting.</p><p>He has to say it. There is no way to get rid of it.</p><p>And his saying will have a totally different significance because
words will not be mere words. If such a person sits silently, even his
silence will be a sharing. If such a person keeps completely silent, you
will see his silence is singing all around him. You will feel the
vibe.</p><p>His silence is saying something. He is indicating from his silence
too. If he speaks he speaks.</p><p>If he is silent, then too he speaks.</p><p>If you don't sing it, remember, you don't have it. If it does not
overflow in a thousand and one gestures, then it is not there. You
cannot hold it if it is there. And you cannot possess it if it is there;
it is not your property. You cannot become the owner of it. You cannot
hoard it, you cannot be miserly about it. If it is there at all, it
drowns you utterly. It possesses you. You cannot possess it; it
possesses you. And then it leads you into a thousand and one gestures.
In a thousand and one streams you start flowing, and whatsoever you do
becomes an expression.</p><p>I have heard a very beautiful legend. The legend is, there was a
great Master in</p><p>India, the twenty-seventh successor of Gautam the Buddha; his name
was Hanyatara. A king in south India requested him to come to his court.
The king himself came, bowed down to Hanyatara, touched his feet, and
said, "Please, come to my court, to bless us. And this has been my
desire, to listen to some sutras of Gautam the Buddha by a man who is a
Buddha himself, so I have been avoiding scholars, pundits, professors. I
have been avoiding, I have been waiting, Osho - The First Principle</p><p>113</p><p>Chapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence</p><p>because those sutras that Buddha uttered are so pregnant that only a
man who has attained to that consciousness will be able to give
expression to them."</p><p>Hanyatara came to the court with an attendant. The king was thrilled;
it was his dream for his whole life one day to have a Buddha in his
court, in his palace. The whole palace was decorated, the whole town was
decorated; the whole capital was celebrating. It was a great day of
celebration. But the king was puzzled, a little bewildered: Hanyatara
sat silently, not saying a single word, and the attendant recited the
sutra. Now, this was not the purpose at all. The king could have found
better people to recite the sutra than the attendant. He was just an
attendant who looked after Hanyatara, just used to do small errands, a
very ordinary man, not even a great scholar. His grammar was faulty, his
pronunciation was not exactly as it should be. He was an ordinary
man.</p><p>Just out of respect, the king kept silent. When the sutra was
finished, he touched the feet of Hanyatara and said, "Sir, enlighten me
about this; otherwise I will remain puzzled. Why did not YOU recite the
sutra?"</p><p>And Hanyatara said, "What, I did not recite the sutra? Then what else
was I doing the whole time here? You fool!"</p><p>The king was even more puzzled, because he had kept quiet, he had not
said a single word.</p><p>The king said, "Please, explain it to me. I don't understand. I am an
ordinary, ignorant person.</p><p>I may not know the ways of the Buddhas."</p><p>And Hanyatara said, "I sat silently, breathing in, breathing out.
That was my sutra. What else is there in life? Breathe in, breathe out.
Be alert, aware. When I breathed in, I was aware; when I breathed out, I
was aware. It was all awareness! What else is a sutra? Awareness. If you
had listened to the rhythm of my breathing you would have understood. I
have recited it!</p><p>Words are one way to recite it. Breathing silently, but with full
awareness, is another way to recite it -- and far better a way. I have
been very expressive today, as I have never been before.</p><p>Thinking that you have been waiting for so long, I thought, 'Why not
give the real thing?' "</p><p>The king was thrilled, seeing the compassion. Now he felt there was a
certain rhythm in his silence. Now he became aware, retrospectively of
course, that this man was not silent in the ordinary way. He had seen
silent people; sometimes he himself had sat in silence. This was a
different silence. There was a song, certainly there was a song. There
was a fragrance around this man. There was a vibe of a different
quality; he was vibrating. Strange it was, but now he remembered, yes,
it was there. And the way he was breathing was no ordinary way.</p><p>Not that he was doing anything special in the breathing: his
breathing was pure, natural, like a small baby.</p><p>When you breathe, your breathing is never natural. If you are a
little angry, your anger changes your breathing. If you are full of
passion, lust, your lust changes your breathing. If you are greedy, your
greed is reflected in your breathing. Continuously your mind mood
infiltrates breathing and changes it. You can watch it. When you are
angry, try not to disturb the breathing, and you will be completely
unable to be angry. Just try not to change the breathing. Let the
breathing remain as it was before you became angry, and then try to be
angry. It will be impossible. The breathing has to change first. Through
the breathing the body changes; the mind first affects the breathing.
When you are in a moment of lust, watch, keep the breathing natural, and
you will suddenly find the lust has disappeared, the moment came and
passed.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 114</p><p>Chapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence</p><p>By and by you will be able to see each mood is reflected in your
breathing, so your breathing is never natural, because there is some
mood or other. The natural breathing means there is no mood: that means
there is no mind -- neither anger nor greed nor lust nor jealousy nor
love nor hate. No -- mood means no-mind. In that state of no-mind the
breathing is natural. Then there is a song to it, then there is a
totally different quality to it. Then it is pure life. Then the flame is
without smoke.</p><p>Yes, the king remembered, there was something strange, something was
happening. He had missed it. He started crying. He said, "I have missed
it. Why didn't you tell me before?</p><p>Now I know there was something, and I had even felt it, but my
consciousness is not so developed, so I could not understand what was
happening.</p><p>"And I was too concerned about that foolish sutra. I was continuously
thinking about why you were not reciting the sutra and why this
attendant was reciting the sutra. I was so much concerned about the
sutra that I missed.</p><p>"But I am grateful that you showed such compassion, that you showed
your being so naked, so true, so authentic."</p><p>He presented a great diamond, the most valuable he had, to Hanyatara,
and then he said to Hanyatara, "I have three sons. Sir, be kind enough.
I will call them. Bless them."</p><p>Thinking that young people are young people, and the youngest was
only seven, they may disturb the sutra reciting, he had not called them
to participate before.</p><p>The three young princes came in.</p><p>Rather than blessing them, Hanyatara showed the diamond that the king
had presented to him to the first prince, the eldest. He must have been
somewhere near fifteen. The prince looked at the diamond and said, "A
great diamond, of the finest water, purest water. Where could you get
it? It is rare. It is no ordinary diamond."</p><p>Yes, his understanding about the diamond was perfectly true. It was a
rare</p><p>diamond, of the most perfect water. Even Hanyatara had never seen
such a thing.</p><p>Then he called the second prince, who must have been near about ten,
and the second prince looked at the diamond, and he said, "Not only the
finest, not only the best, it is certain that it belongs to my father
because in this kingdom nobody can have such a diamond. It is rare. Sir,
it does not belong to you, it cannot. To protect this diamond you will
need a great army, otherwise you cannot have it. Just this attendant
won't do."</p><p>Yes, his understanding was also very correct.</p><p>And then the third son was called. He was only seven. He looked at
the diamond, looked at Hanyatara, and laughed and said, "What? Do you
want to befool me?" He was only seven, and he said, "Do you want to
befool me? You cannot! Because the real diamonds are never of the
outside. And what are you trying to show me? You have the real diamond
within YOU. I can see it! This is just a stone that you have in your
hand. Throw it, sir!"</p><p>And it is said that Hanyatara hugged this small boy.</p><p>This boy's name was Bodhitara, and Hanyatara changed his name to
Bodhidharma. He became the twenty-eighth successor of Buddha; he was the
first patriarch of Zen in China, this small boy Bodhitara, whose name
Hanyatara changed to Bodhidharma.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 115</p><p>Chapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence</p><p>Hanyatara said, "This boy has looked into the deepest reality anybody
can look into.</p><p>DHARMA means 'the ultimate reality'. He has penetrated to the
ultimate reality." He said to the king, "Even you could not see who I
am. That's why you missed my sermon, my silent sermon. That's why you
missed my silent song. I was singing here but you missed. But this boy,
yes, I cannot befool him. This boy is going to be my successor."</p><p>And then he said to the king, "Sir, forgive me. I have not come for
you and I have not come because you requested me to. I had to come
because of this boy. I have been in search of this boy! This has been a
promise from the past life, and this has been a decided gesture: in the
past life I told this boy, 'I will seek you and find you and I will show
you a diamond, and that will be the moment of your examination. If you
can see my inner diamond and you are not befooled, you will be my
successor.'"</p><p>The legend is of tremendous value. First, the silent sermon. Yes,
sometimes a mystic can be silent -- but he is not silent! His silence is
a very telling silence. He may not do anything, he may not even move his
eyes, he may not move any of his limbs, but still his presence goes on
doing a thousand and one things. Just to be in his presence, just to
breathe with him in the same rhythm, and something is transferred: his
song, his silence, his dance. You will never be the same again.</p><p>Truth is not hidden, from the very beginning. Truth is unhidden; only
your eyes are closed.</p><p>Truth is being preached from every tree and from every bird and from
every rock and from every star; just your eyes, your ears, your
sensitivity is not there. You are deaf. Truth is not dumb; you are deaf.
And truth is not hiding anywhere.</p><p>A man came to a Zen Master and asked, "Sir, where should I go to find
the truth?" And the Zen Master said, "You just keep looking in front of
your nose and go on, and you will find it.</p><p>It is just in front of your nose! Truth is just in front of you. In
fact, wherever you look it is truth, you just need to know how to look
for it. But you are looking for other things; that's why you go on
missing.</p><p>That great king missed Hanyatara's sermon. It was a Zen sermon, the
same as Buddha preached to the first Zen Master, Mahakashyap, sitting
silently, holding a flower in his hand.</p><p>This second sermon, of Hanyatara to the king, was even more subtle.
He was not even holding a flower in his hand. He was just breathing in
and out, a natural breathing, an ordinary breathing, unaffected by the
mind. And truth was there and the sutras were recited there through his
breathing, but the king missed.</p><p>You may have come across a Buddha in your life -- or you may have
come</p><p>across many Buddhas in your past lives -- but you have missed because
you were not sensitive enough to feel that vibe. That vibe is subtle.
You were not aware enough to move to that height, to feel the
presence.</p><p>Be a little more alert. The sermon is preached constantly. From
everywhere God is speaking to you. Even when everything is silent he is
speaking through silence. His song is eternal.</p><p>Zen says, "Truth is not hidden, from the very beginning, so you are
not to uncover truth, you are only to uncover your eyes." You just have
a curtain on your eyes. Just pull your earplugs out. Your ears are
plugged; hence you cannot hear.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 116</p><p>Chapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence</p><p>How to unplug the ears? How to open the eyes? How to drop barriers
that don't allow you to become sensitive enough? What is the way? The
way is IMMEDIACY. Be immediate, be in the moment.</p><p>Otherwise Buddhas can go on shouting from the housetops, and you will
not hear -- or you will hear something which has not been said at
all.</p><p>A few scenes. First scene:</p><p>Warden: "Can't you see the sign 'NO FISHING HERE'?"</p><p>Angler: "Yes, and I don't agree. There is good fishing here! Just
look at this lot I have landed today. Whoever put that sign up must be
crazy."</p><p>The second scene:</p><p>The Dean of Women was lecturing to a class on the subject of sex
morality. "In moments of temptation, ask yourself just one question: Is
an hour of pleasure worth a lifetime of shame?"</p><p>One of the girls raised her hand naively and asked, "How do you make
it last one</p><p>hour?"</p><p>The third scene:</p><p>Ethel was shapely out shy, and visited a doctor for the first time.
He ushered her into his private office and said, "Now, my dear, please
get completely undressed."</p><p>Ethel blushed and replied, "Okay, Doctor, but you first." Fourth
scene:</p><p>The following ad appeared in the Personal column of a London paper:
"My husband and I have four sons. Has anyone any suggestions as to how
we may have a daughter?" Letters poured in from all over the world. An
American wrote, "If at first you don't succeed, try, try, and try
again." A Buddhist from Thailand suggested that they should seek the
help of Buddha.</p><p>A South African recommended a special diet. An Indian proposed yoga.
A Frenchman merely wrote, "May I be of service?"</p><p>And the last and the fifth scene:</p><p>A lion tamer had quit without notice, and the circus manager needed
someone to replace him for the next night's show. He put an ad in the
local paper, and the next morning two Osho - The First Principle</p><p>117</p><p>Chapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence</p><p>applicants showed up outside his office. One was a rather ordinary
looking young man, and the other a ravishing redheaded beauty. Neither
one of them looked very much like a lion trainer, but the manager was
desperate. "All right," he said. "Here is a whip, a chair, and a gun.
Let us see what you can do with the big Leo over there. We will let you
have the first try, miss, but be careful. He is a mean one."</p><p>The ravishing redhead strode past the whip, the chair, and the gun,
and empty-</p><p>handed, fearlessly entered the cage. Big Leo rose, snarling, then
came charging across the cage towards her with a ferocious roar. When
the lion was almost upon her the girl threw open her coat.</p><p>Underneath, she was stark naked. Leo skidded to a stop and crawled
the rest of the way on his belly. He nuzzled the girl's feet with his
nose, purred, and licked her trim ankles.</p><p>The astonished circus manager grinned happily and turned to the
pop-eyed young man.</p><p>"Well, young fella," he asked, "think you can top that?"</p><p>"Yeah," panted the applicant. "Just get that stupid lion out of
there."</p><p>Truth is all around, but your interpretations are YOUR
interpretations. God is speaking all the time, but you hear not, or even
if you hear, you hear something else. You hear according to you, your
mind comes in, and hence you go on missing.</p><p>Unless the mind is dropped you will not be able to know what truth
is. Truth cannot be discovered by mind; mind is the barrier. It is
because of the mind that you have not been able to discover it. It is
not a question of how to train the mind to know the truth. The more the
mind is trained and becomes capable, the less is the possibility to know
the truth. The more skilled a mind, the farther away you are from the
truth.</p><p>Mind is the barrier. No-mind is the door.</p><p>How to attain to no-mind? The only way -- the ONLY way -- is to be in
the present. The only way is not to think of the past, not to think of
the future. And you cannot think of the present. That is the whole
secret: you cannot think of the present; there is not space enough for
thought to move. Thought needs room to move. Can you think anything
right now? If you think it, either it will be of the past or of the
future.</p><p>This moment of silence. If you think, "Yes, this is a moment of
silence," it is already past.</p><p>Or you say, "How beautiful!" It is already past. Utter a word
"beautiful," and it is</p><p>already past.</p><p>You cannot think. Thinking stops when you are in the present. So that
is the only key, and it is a master key; it unlocks all the doors of
being. Immediacy, that is the whole insistence of Zen.</p><p>If you go to a Zen Master and you ask something, it is unpredictable
what he will do to you. He may hit you. Or he may not hit you; he may
hit himself! Or he may say something absurd, totally irrelevant to what
you have asked. Somebody asks, "How to attain Buddhahood?" and the
Master says, "The cypress tree in the courtyard." Now what? How are they
related? They are not, but the Master is indicating, "Please, drop all
this nonsense. Look at this -- THIS -- cypress tree in the courtyard.
What nonsense are you talking about? --</p><p>Buddha, and how to become a Buddha. You are talking about the past
and the future. You have heard about Buddha in the past, so you have a
greed, a desire. Now you want to become a Buddha in the future, so you
have come to me. All nonsense." He simply gives something immediate; he
says, "Look! The cypress tree in the courtyard." It is not relevant if
you think in terms of the mind. If you think in terms of no-mind it is
the only thing relevant.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 118</p><p>Chapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence</p><p>A man comes to a Zen Master and asks, "What is the way?" And the
Master says, "Listen,"</p><p>and everything becomes silent, and just by the side of the Master's
hut flows a fountain, and the water is making the sound, the murmur. The
sound of the water, the sound of the running water. For a moment
everything is silent, the seeker, the questioner, is also. The Master
says,</p><p>"Listen. Hear. This is the way." The sound of the running water?
That's all he has heard. And the Master says, "Hear! This is the way to
become a Buddha, to attain to enlightenment." He is bringing the mind to
an immediacy, to a state of immediacy.</p><p>What is he saying? He is not saying anything about the sound of the
running water. In that moment, when suddenly the Master shocked the
inquirer -- because he was asking about the way to attain to nirvana,
and the Master says, "Listen", it is so out of context, it is so
unrelated to his question, that for a moment, out of the shock of it,
the sheer shock of it, everything becomes silent. And when the Master
says, "Hear. This is the way." He is not saying anything about the
running water or its sound. He is indicating the silent moment that has
penetrated into the consciousness of the inquirer. He says, "Hear. This
is the way."</p><p>If you become immediate you attain. If you live moment to moment you
attain. Once a Western psychiatrist went to see a Zen</p><p>Master in Japan. "How do you deal with neurotics?" he asked. The
Master replied, simply, "I trap them."</p><p>Trap them? The psychiatrist could not understand what he means by
trapping them. How can you trap a neurotic? The neurotic will trap
you!</p><p>"But how?" pressed the psychiatrist.</p><p>The Master replied, "I get them to where they cannot ask any more
questions." Then they are trapped, if they cannot ask any more
questions.</p><p>If the mind is allowed to ask questions, then the mind goes on and
on, so the Zen Master brings you down to the immediate facticity of
life. Sometimes he may hit you. By hitting, suddenly you are herenow. It
is great compassion.</p><p>You ask, "Has God created the world?" and the Master hits you,
sharply. For a moment you are puzzled, shocked. For a moment all
thinking stops. The very shock of it, the unpredictableness of it. For a
moment, certainly, certainly for a moment, everything stops.</p><p>And the Master says, "This, this is how God created the world." This
is how God goes on creating the world. This moment of pure silence, this
moment of no- mind, is the door to all solutions, to salvation, to
liberation.</p><p>This is unique; sometimes a Master will do something which you had
not expected at all.</p><p>And the Master can do that only if he is not following certain rules.
He is not following any. If he simply repeats from old Masters, then
disciples become acquainted with it. No, sometimes he will do something
you cannot believe.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 119</p><p>Chapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence</p><p>There was a Zen Master who used to talk about God or Buddha, but
whenever he would talk about God or Buddha or the ultimate reality he
would raise his hand: one finger pointing towards the sky. This became a
joke among his disciples. Whenever they would talk about such great
things they would raise their fingers and point to God. A small young
boy was the attendant of the Master; he used to bring his tea and things
like that. He became a perfect master in showing his finger, and he was
always there and the Master was always doing it to everybody, so he
became very perfect; he could imitate it perfectly.</p><p>And the Master was aware of it. Sometimes he would be standing by the
side at the back and the Master would raise his finger and he would also
raise his finger and everybody would laugh -- and the Master was aware
of what was happening.</p><p>One day the boy did that, and the Master called him in front of him,
took a sharp knife, and cut off his finger. The boy's finger was cut
off. The pain was sharp; the boy shrieked. And the Master said, "Stop!
Now do it. Now do it! Whatsoever you have been doing for so long --</p><p>now do it without the finger!"</p><p>And when the Master shouted, "Stop!" all pain disappeared in that
moment, there was silence. And the small young boy showed the finger
which was not there anymore, blood was flowing. But it is said in that
moment he became enlightened.</p><p>Now, it is possible. That very sharpness of it.</p><p>Another story. In a Zen Master's ashram there were five hundred
monks, and there were two wings. Just in the middle was the Master's
hut; on one side was one wing, on the other side the other wing. There
was a beautiful cat, and there was a great debate between these two
sides as to whom it belonged. It almost became a quarrel, and things
went to such a state that both the wings were ready to kill each other
for the cat. To whom does it belong? The left wing was saying, "It
belongs to us"; and the right wing was saying. "It belongs to us." It
was a really beautiful cat.</p><p>The Master heard it. He called the whole ashram, and the cat was
brought, and he said,</p><p>"Now, give me a true answer, any one of you, and the cat will belong
to him. Stand up and show your understanding of reality, any one of you.
And if you don't show within seconds, I will cut the cat in two, and one
part will go to the left side and one part will go to the right
side."</p><p>They were shocked. They could not find out how to respond to the
Master's demand. What to do so that the cat can be saved? What to do?
They started thinking. In their very thinking they missed the moment
because when you think, you cannot be immediate and you cannot show your
understanding of reality. You cannot show the understanding of
immediacy. Not a single monk out of those five hundred could show.</p><p>For seconds the Master waited, then took a sword, cut the cat in two;
half the cat was given to each wing, and he disposed of it. He said,
"Now go." They were all sorry.</p><p>By the evening, one monk, who had gone outside, came back. When he
came in to see the Master, he was just taking his shoes off, and the
Master said, "Where have you been? Were you not there when I cut the cat
in two? I had told the other monks that if they can show some
understanding of reality the cat can be saved. Where have you been?"</p><p>The young man, who had taken off one shoe and was going to take off
the other shoe, took that shoe, put it on his head, walked back.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 120</p><p>Chapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence</p><p>And the Master called him, "Come, my son. Had you been here the cat
would be alive still.</p><p>The cat could have been saved if you were here."</p><p>That immediacy. Not that this is the answer, but the immediacy. That
was the moment. He allowed it to happen. It was not done with the mind,
with thinking. It was done without any thinking, it was done without any
mind. He simply said that it is as foolish as me having my shoe on my
head to cut the cat. It is as foolish. But it was not an answer from the
mind. It was an immediate response. And the Master said, "My boy, if you
had been here, the cat would have been alive. But those fools could not
show any understanding."</p><p>Now this small, beautiful anecdote:</p><p>A PUZZLED MONK ONCE SAID TO FUKETSU, "YOU SAY TRUTH CAN BE</p><p>EXPRESSED WITHOUT SPEAKING, AND WITHOUT KEEPING SILENT. HOW CAN</p><p>THIS BE?"</p><p>FUKETSU ANSWERED, "IN SOUTHERN CHINA, IN THE SPRING, WHEN I WAS</p><p>ONLY A LAD, AH! HOW THE BIRDS SANG AMONG THE BLOSSOMS. "</p><p>A very simple anecdote, but with great significance. Meditate over
it. A PUZZLED MONK ONCE SAID TO FUKETSU ...</p><p>From where do you become puzzled? From the mind. The mind is always
dividing things, and then cannot figure it out. Once you divide, there
is conflict and confusion. How can it be?</p><p>Once you divide -- this is good, this is bad -- then the question
arises: "Why has God created a world where so much evil exists?" You
divide, that this is good</p><p>and this is bad, and once you divide, then the problem arises: "Why
has God created such a world where so much evil exists, so much
bad?"</p><p>Now, you call God "God" because you think he is good. God is both and
neither. Division is yours. It is your problem; it is not God's problem.
You say, "Why do so many people die?</p><p>Why has God created a world where death happens?" You don't
understand at all. First you divide life in two parts, life and death.
It is undivided. For God death is as beautiful as birth; they are both
parts of the same phenomenon. For the whole there is no distinction
between birth and death. Birth is a death, and death is a birth. They
both are the same: two polarities, two which can exist only in
togetherness. Life cannot exist without death, and neither can death
exist without life.</p><p>Have you ever observed the fact? All that you love in life is
possible only because of death. You love a woman because today she is
beautiful, tomorrow she may not be. Old age.</p><p>Today she is here, tomorrow she may not be there. Death is possible.
You love the woman. If you knew that the beauty is eternal, that always
and always the woman will be beautiful and that nobody is going to die,
will there be joy in life? It will be sheer boredom. And if it was
impossible even to commit suicide, you cannot conceive of a more
miserable life -- just people living and living and doing the same thing
again and again and again and nothing ever Osho - The First
Principle</p><p>121</p><p>Chapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence</p><p>changes and everything is eternal, nobody ever dies. Just think if
all the people that have lived on the earth were living now -- there
will not be any space even to stand -- and everybody was eternal ...
Life will lose all beauty. The beauty is in its momentariness.</p><p>That's why I go on insisting: Celebrate the temporal. By celebrating
it you will know that this is the way the eternal functions. The
temporal is a function of the eternal.</p><p>Celebrate the temporal. Celebrate the momentary. In the momentary is
the eternal, hiding.</p><p>Don't throw it away. If you throw the momentary you are throwing the
baby with the bathwater. The eternal is hidden there. The eternal comes
in the momentary, penetrates the moment.</p><p>A PUZZLED MONK ONCE SAID TO FUKETSU ...</p><p>What was his bewilderment? What was his confusion? Why was he so
puzzled? The puzzle was there because he says the Master has said ...
"YOU SAY TRUTH CAN BE</p><p>EXPRESSED WITHOUT SPEAKING, AND WITHOUT KEEPING SILENT. "</p><p>Now, this is impossible; this is very contradictory. If you say,
"Truth can be expressed by words," okay. If you say, "Truth cannot be
expressed by words," then it naturally means,</p><p>"Truth can be expressed by silence." But the Master says, "Truth
cannot be expressed by words, and truth cannot be expressed by silence."
And the Master says, "Truth can be expressed by words too, and it can be
expressed by silence too." Now, it is confusing. Now, it is illogical,
it is absurd.</p><p>How can this be that truth can be expressed without speaking and
without keeping silent?</p><p>One can do only one; either one can speak it or one can keep silent.
You deny both? Then what is the possibility?</p><p>FUKETSU ANSWERED, "IN SOUTHERN CHINA, IN THE SPRING, WHEN I WAS</p><p>ONLY A LAD, AH! HOW THE BIRDS SANG AMONG THE BLOSSOMS."</p><p>Now, this is very irrelevant. What the disciple is asking and what
the Master is saying is not related at all, but it is related in a
nonmind way. Meditate over it, how it is related in a nonmind way.</p><p>He has said many things. First, he says "IN THE SPRING'.' First, he
says,</p><p>"When the spring came, HOW THE BIRDS SANG AMONG THE BLOSSOMS." They
were expressing truth, but they were silent when the spring was not
there; and when the spring came they sang, they burst forth into
celebration. So the first thing is "when the spring is there". What does
he mean? He means when you have the spring in your heart, when the light
has dawned upon you, when the right maturity has happened, when the
right climate has happened, when your fruit is ripe, when the spring has
come -- that is what satori is, the spring of the inner heart --</p><p>when the SAMADHI has come, then you need not bother: the birds don't
go to schools to learn how to sing. The spring has come. They don't seek
teachers. They don't go in to anybody, they don't ask the elders, "How
to sing? The spring has come." When the spring comes the spring starts
singing in them.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 122</p><p>Chapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence</p><p>What the Master means is that when SAMADHI is there, you will know.
How to say it without saying it and without keeping silent -- you will
know it. It is not a question.</p><p>Many people go on asking foolish questions. The question was foolish.
People come to me, they say, "If we become enlightened, what will happen
to our family?" You please first become enlightened. "If we become
enlightened what will become of our business?" You first become
enlightened. Right now you are asking it as if it will create some
problem. It has never created any problem. Whenever somebody becomes
enlightened, he knows what to do. If an enlightened person does not know
what to do, then who will know?</p><p>If you come to me and you ask me, "When truth has happened, how are
we going to express it?" ... When it happens when the spring comes --
the birds know how to sing. In fact, there is no "how" to it. The very
presence of the spring, and the birds are thrilled. Something goes
berserk in their hearts. Something simply starts pulsating their being,
something simply starts singing in their being. It is not that they
sing. It is spring that sings in them. It is satori, it is SAMADHI, that
is expressed by you. It is not a question of YOU expressing it.</p><p>That's why the Master says, "It cannot be expressed through words,
and it cannot be expressed through silence." The very question that can
be expressed through words is foolish, the very question that can be
expressed through silence is foolish, because nobody knows --</p><p>when the spring comes the cuckoo will sing in its own way, and the
parrots will fly in their own way, and there will be a thousand and one
songs, different, unique.</p><p>The cuckoo cannot screech the way parrots do, and the parrots cannot
imitate the cuckoos.</p><p>And there is no need. The cuckoo is beautiful, so is the parrot.</p><p>When satori has happened, nobody knows. Meera dances; Buddha never
danced. The cuckoo and the parrot ...</p><p>Listen ...</p><p>Chaitanya sang, took his drum and danced all over Bengal. Mahavir
remained in silence, never spoke a single word. Now, you will be
puzzled. Then how do the Jaina sutras exist?</p><p>How? It is a beautiful story.</p><p>Jainas say Mahavir never spoke, but those who were able to hear him,
they heard, and they have collected the sayings. Listen again; you may
have missed: Jainas say Mahavir never spoke, but those who could hear,
they heard. In his silent presence they heard what he was saying, and
they collected the sayings. The Jaina sutras start always, "We have
heard." They don't start, "Mahavir said," no. The disciples say, "We
have heard. That's true, on our part, we have heard. We don't know
whether he has said it or not, but in a certain moment we heard it.</p><p>A voiceless voice, a soundless sound."</p><p>Yes, a cuckoo is a cuckoo, a parrot is a parrot, and both are needed.
If the world is only for cuckoos it will be ugly. Too many cuckoos, it
will not be good. Existence needs variety, and existence is rich because
of variety. Yes, it is good sometimes a Mahavir keeps silent, and it is
good sometimes a Meera goes mad, dancing. It is good to have a Christ
and a Krishna. It is good to have a</p><p>Zarathustra and a Mohammed and a Lao Tzu. All are so different and so
unique, and yet the message is the same.</p><p>Those who have eyes to see, they will see the same truth being
expressed in millions of forms. And those who have ears to hear, they
will hear the same song, sung in so many different languages.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 123</p><p>Chapter 7 - The Song of Sound and Silence</p><p>It is the same rose; whether you call it "rose" or GULAB does not
make any difference. In India we call it GULAB, in the West you call it
"rose". Sometimes we can even quarrel and argue "What is it -- GULAB or
rose?"</p><p>Zen Masters say, "Don't quarrel, please. Bring a GULAB or a rose,
whatsoever you call it.</p><p>Bring it here. Make it immediate, and then look." And then the
quarrel ceases because when somebody brings a rose you will see -- and
he call it GULAB -- you will understand; you will say, "Okay, that's
okay. Call it whatsoever you want to call it. It is the same thing I
have been calling rose and you call GULAB, and we have been
quarreling."</p><p>Scholars quarrel, argue. Masters look at the thing called rose or
GULAB, or there can be a thousand names -- there are so many languages,
each language has a different name for it.</p><p>Each person who attains to SAMADHI gives expression in his own way.
But the question is: Has the spring come?</p><p>So the Master says, "IN SOUTHERN CHINA, IN THE SPRING, WHEN I WAS
ONLY</p><p>A LAD, AH! HOW THE BIRDS SANG AMONG THE BLOSSOMS." The</p><p>second thing he says, "When I was only a boy when my eyes were
innocent, when I was young and fresh and virgin, when I was not
corrupted by the society, when I was uncorrupted, when my freshness had
not gathered any dust of</p><p>knowledge, experience -- THEN. "</p><p>"... IN THE SPRING, WHEN I WAS ONLY A LAD, AH! HOW THE BIRDS SANG</p><p>AMONG THE BLOSSOMS." There were a great many flowers and a great many
birds, and singing, the same song, the same spring, the same youth, the
same life juice. What he is saying is, "Please, let the spring come
first, and don't be worried about how it can be said neither in words
nor in silence."</p><p>It can be said both in words and in silence. In fact, whenever it is
said, there is word and silence together. But the word is not a mere
word; that's why they say it cannot be said through words. And the
silence is not a dead silence, it is not the silence of the cemetery;
that's why the Master says it cannot be said through silence, either.
The word is not of the pundit, and the silence is not of the dead man;
but there is a great marriage between word and silence.</p><p>The word speaks through silence, the silence speaks through the word;
and when silence and word meet there is song. Then there is
celebration.</p><p>When the spring has come there is celebration. When the SAMADHI has
happened there is celebration. In that celebration it is expressed, and
it is expressed abundantly. In that celebration, in that blossoming, it
is expressed. But it is expressed only for those who can understand, who
can see, who can feel, who can love.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 124</p><p>Chapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial 8</p><p>The Profound and the Trivial</p><p>18 April 1977 am in Buddha Hall Question</p><p>MY EXPERIENCE OF ME IS THE MOST PROFOUND EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.</p><p>IT IS ALSO THE MOST TRIVIAL. PLEASE CLARIFY.</p><p>The question is from Dhruva, and the question is really significant.
The question has arisen out of an insight, almost a mini-satori.</p><p>That's how life is, profound and trivial at the same time,
simultaneously. There is no contradiction, Dhruva, in the profundity of
life and its trivialness. You have been taught that the sacred is far
away and it is never the profane. You have been taught a distinction
between the profane and the sacred, between the profound and the
trivial. In fact, there is no distinction. The trivial is the profound,
the ordinary is the extraordinary, and the temporal is the eternal.</p><p>So this is a great insight. Don't lose sight of it. More possibility
is there that you will lose it, because it will go against the grain.
Your whole training has been such that you are always dividing: into
good and bad, into the pure and the impure, the perfect and the
imperfect, into virtue and sin, the holy and the unholy. You have always
been making these distinctions, and because of distinctions you have
missed the reality of that which is.</p><p>This cuckoo singing there and Christ speaking to you are not
different. A leaf falling from the tree and a word falling from the lips
of Buddha are not different. The very dust is divine.</p><p>The distinction is man-made, it is a mind trick.</p><p>And because of these distinctions, these categories, we are never
together, we cannot be together. How can you be together if you make
such an unbridgeable gap between the profound and the trivial? Then you
will find your whole life is trivial. Eating, drinking, sleeping,
walking, going to the office or to the farm -- all is trivia.</p><p>Then where will you find the profound? In the church, in the temple,
sometimes praying and meditating, sometimes listening to me? Then the
profound will not be much in your life, and the profound will be, in a
way, false. It will not permeate your whole life. It will not be there
always with you. It will not surround you like a climate. Sometimes you
will have to make an effort to have that quality of profundity, and
again and again you will lose it. And you will</p><p>become divided, schizophrenic; you will become two, split, and you
will start condemning yourself.</p><p>Whenever you will see something trivial you will condemn yourself,
that "I am just trivial, ordinary." And whenever you will see something
profound you will start feeling holier than thou; you will start feeling
very egoistic. Both are dangerous.</p><p>To feel that you are trivial is a condemnation. It creates an
inferiority complex. It pulls you down into sadness. It forces you to
remain depressed. And, naturally, you cannot love Osho - The First
Principle</p><p>125</p><p>Chapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial</p><p>yourself: you are so trivial. You are so ordinary, how can you love
yourself? You fall too short from the ideal of perfection. So a great
condemnation arises in your being, and the moment you condemn yourself
you are in hell. Then nobody can take you out of it. Even if somebody
comes and says you are beautiful, you will not trust him. You will think
he is trying to cheat you, bribe you. He is trying to exploit you. How
can you be beautiful? You know yourself better than he knows you. You
are not beautiful; you are ugly. You are the ugliest person in the
world.</p><p>Because of this condemnation, love will not happen. How can you love
anybody if you are feeling so condemned in yourself? And how can you
allow somebody to love you if you are feeling so condemned? Love is
impossible. When you live in self-condemnation you live in hell. Hell is
not somewhere else: it is in your attitude; it is a condemning
attitude.</p><p>When you accept yourself and you enjoy yourself, you are in heaven.
Heaven is also an attitude.</p><p>And you can move from heaven and hell any moment you decide! And you
go on moving; you swing between heaven and hell. Just understand that it
is your creation.</p><p>So if you feel condemned because of your trivia, you will be in hell.
And then sometimes you will start feeling very holy because you have
done something great. You have saved a life</p><p>-- somebody was drowning in the ocean and you saved him, and a child
was caught in a house on fire and you jumped in and you risked your
life, you have done something great -- then you will feel very egoistic.
Ego is again hell.</p><p>To feel superior is to be in hell, to feel inferior is to be in hell.
To drop all superiority, inferiority, and just to be is to be in
heaven.</p><p>The idea of condemnation is also ego-oriented. People have impossible
ideals. Just the other night Vishnu came; he writes again and again that
"I am not perfect. What should I do?"</p><p>that "I am imperfect," that "Whatsoever I do is imperfect." He is
torturing himself because he is imperfect. But who is not imperfect? The
very idea that "I should be perfect," is very egoistic. The very effort
is egoistic. Nobody is perfect.</p><p>In fact, perfection cannot exist, by its very nature. To be perfect
means to be dead. Then there will be no evolution, when you are perfect.
Then how can you survive? For what? If God is perfect then God is dead.
If God is imperfect only then is he alive and can be alive.</p><p>I preach the imperfect God, and I preach the imperfect existence, and
I preach the beauty of imperfection and the life of imperfection. The
very idea that "I have to be perfect," that "No flaw should be there in
my life" is egoistic. And certainly you will find a thousand and one
flaws.</p><p>So on one hand you are on an ego trip, which creates trouble, makes
you miserable, because you are not perfect; and on the other hand the
same trip creates condemnation. You want to be superior and you know
that you are inferior: both are two aspects of the same coin.</p><p>You remain in hell.</p><p>Enjoy your imperfection. Enjoy the way you are.</p><p>And drop all distinctions between the holy and the unholy, sin and
virtue, good and bad, God and devil. Destroy all those distinctions.
Those are the traps you are caught in. Those are the traps which don't
allow you to live, don't allow you freedom. You cannot dance: one foot
Osho - The First Principle</p><p>126</p><p>Chapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial</p><p>is encaged in inferiority, another foot is encaged in superiority.
You are chained. How can you dance? Drop all these chains.</p><p>That's what Zen people say: "A hair's distinction, and heaven and
hell are set apart." That's what Tilopa says. A little distinction, a
hair's distinction, and hell and heaven are set apart, and you are
caught in the duality. No distinction, and you are free. No distinction,
is freedom.</p><p>The profundity of the trivial and the trivialness of the profound,
that's what I teach.</p><p>Eating is trivial if you look from the outside. If you look from the
inside it is profound, it is a miracle -- that you can eat bread and the
bread is turned into blood, that it becomes your flesh, that it becomes
your bones, that it even becomes your marrow. You eat bread, and the
bread becomes your thoughts, dreams. It is a miracle. It is the
profoundest thing that is happening. When you are eating, it is no
ordinary thing. God is at work. It is creative. While chewing bread you
are creating life, unknowingly, unconsciously. You are making a thousand
and one things possible. Tomorrow you may paint: and that bread that you
had eaten has become painting. Tomorrow you may sing, or right now you
may do something which would not be possible if the bread was not
there.</p><p>The Christian prayer is beautiful; it says, "God, give us our daily
bread." Looks very trivial! What does Jesus mean when he says, "Pray
every day, 'Give us our daily bread'"?</p><p>Couldn't he think of anything more profound? Bread? You just change
the word "bread" and say every day in your prayer, "Lord, give us our
daily tea," and you will see how foolish it looks. But the bread or tea
or coffee -- or Coca-Cola! ... yes, Coca-Cola too is divine.</p><p>Everything is divine -- because how can it be otherwise?</p><p>The prayer says, "Give us our daily bread." It is raising the trivial
to the profound. It is a great statement. The Hindus have always been
saying, "ANNAM BRAHMA" -- "Food is God." Raising the trivial to the
profound.</p><p>Looking into the trivial so deeply that it changes into the
profound.</p><p>You are taking a shower. It is trivia, everyday business, but it can
become profound. Just look deep into it. Just standing under the shower,
and the water goes on flowing, and the body feels fresh and young and
alive, and the water is a blessing. Because we are made out of water. A
man is almost eighty percent water, and the first glimpse of life
happened in the sea.</p><p>The first thing that existed was the fish, and even now, in the
mother's womb, the child floats in seawater, with almost the same
ingredients, the same saltiness. That's why when a woman is pregnant she
starts eating more salt; she needs more salt because the child needs
seawater around him. The child is still a fish in the beginning, primary
stage. Water is life, and when you are taking a shower life is showering
on you -- eighty percent of life is showering on you, the most necessary
element for life. No life is possible without water. These trees will
not be there if the water is not, and these birds won't sing, and these
animals won't be there and these men will not be there. All life will
disappear if water disappears.</p><p>There is a profound experience when you are touched by water. You can
make it so profound! It depends on you, how you go into it. It can
become a meditation, a prayer. You can feel grateful, that God is great,
that water is still available.</p><p>To breathe is so trivial, who bothers about it? But breath is your
life. All languages have words for "life" which really mean "breath".
Sanskrit has PRANA for "life"; it means</p><p>"breath". The word "soul" means "breath"; the word "psyche" means
"breath". Osho - The First Principle</p><p>127</p><p>Chapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial</p><p>And the Bible says God made man and breathed life into him. Life
started by breathing into man; otherwise man was just dust. "Adam" means
"dust," "earth". God made Adam out of mud. "Adam" is the Hebrew word for
"earth". Then he breathed life into him. And that's how life happens
always. A child is born and the first thing we wait expectantly for is
that he should cry. Why? Because only</p><p>through crying will he start breathing. For two, three seconds even
the doctor cannot breathe, the nurse cannot breathe. Whether the child
is going to breathe or not, who knows? He may not breathe. If he is not
going to breathe then there will be no life.</p><p>If he breathes there will be life. Still the same happens as it
happens with Adam: God breathes in the child, in each child.</p><p>God is the invisible force, the life energy that surrounds you. It
enters through breath in you, and the day you die you will die through
exhalation. You start life with inhalation, you stop life with
exhalation; then you will not breathe anymore. Again Adam is adam, again
dust is dust, dust unto dust.</p><p>Breath is life, but have you looked into it? Standing under the sun
in the morning, breathe.</p><p>It is God you breathe in. And then it becomes profound. It is your
attitude.</p><p>The trivial and the profound are not two separate things. They are
one, they are together, they are two aspects of one energy. Your life is
trivia if you don't look deep. If you start looking deep your life is
profound.</p><p>So Dhruva, it is a great insight. You say, "My experience of me is
the most profound experience of my life. It is also the most trivial.
Please clarify." Don't get confused. There is nothing to clarify. It is
how life is: the trivial is the profound.</p><p>The question has arisen because Dhruva must have been thinking these
are contradictions, the trivial and the profound. No, they are not
contradictory; they are complementary. The trivial hides the profound.
The trivial functions like a cover, like a crust; it protects the
profound. It is almost like a seed. The seed is protecting the
possibility of the tree. That possibility is very soft; the seed is
hard. The hard seed, the hard crust of the seed, is protecting the
softest possibility, of flowers, of a big tree. And the seed will
protect it till the seed finds the right soil. Then the seed disappears,
then the sheath disappears, then the hard crust dissolves into the earth
and the soft life arises.</p><p>The profound is hidden in the trivial, so look deep. Wherever there
is the trivial there is the profound. Don't escape from the trivial;
otherwise you will be escaping from the profound.</p><p>And don't seek the profound AGAINST the trivial; otherwise you will
never find it.</p><p>Question</p><p>A PLAY QUESTION: IF YOU WERE TO COME HERE NOW TO THIS ASHRAM AS</p><p>A YOUNG UNENLIGHTENED MAN, HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND? WOULD YOU</p><p>BECOME PART OF THE ASHRAM? WHAT WORK WOULD YOU DO? WHERE</p><p>WOULD YOU SIT?</p><p>The question is from Somendra. A beautiful question.</p><p>First, he asks, "If you were to come here now to this ashram as a
young unenlightened man, how would you respond?</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 128</p><p>Chapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial</p><p>Even if I was unenlightened I would not be so unenlightened to come
to this ashram. That much is certain.</p><p>Mulla Nasrudin's wife was dying, and of course he was consoling her
in every way, and the wife opened her eyes and said, "It seems almost
certain that this night will be my last. I will not be able to see the
sunrise again. Mulla, how will you react to my death?"</p><p>The Mulla said, "How will I react to your death? I will go mad!"</p><p>Even in that serious moment the wife started laughing: she said, "You
cunning fellow.</p><p>You will not go mad. I know within a week you will be remarried."</p><p>And Mulla said, "No. I will go mad -- but I will not go THAT mad." So
even if I was unenlightened I would not be THAT unenlightened. Second
thing, you say, "Would you become part of the ashram?"</p><p>Even now I am not part of the ashram. I cannot be part of any
institution or any organization, even my own. And if I had come as an
unenlightened man, naturally, the ashram will not be mine, will be
somebody else's. I cannot be a part even of my own organization, so how
can I be a part of anybody else's organization? Impossible.</p><p>And then you ask, "What work would you do?"</p><p>I have never done any work. I am the laziest man in the world you can
find. And the last, you ask, "Where would you sit?"</p><p>I would escape immediately! I would see some organization, some
ashram and I would run! You are asking, "Where will you sit?" I will not
sit at all.</p><p>Question</p><p>USUALLY I AM "THIS WAY" OR "THAT WAY". BUT FOR SOME TIME I HAVE</p><p>EXPERIENCED ALL KINDS OF CONTRADICTIONS, SIMULTANEOUSLY. I SEE</p><p>WOMEN AS OBJECTS OF WORSHIP, AND AT THE SAME TIME I LUST AFTER</p><p>THEM. I AM CONTENT TO LET LIFE FLOW, AND I AM AFRAID OF THE FUTURE. I
CRAVE TO BE ALONE, AND I CRAVE TO BE ALWAYS WITH PEOPLE. I FEEL</p><p>BIZARRE BECAUSE THESE CONTRADICTIONS ALL SEEM EQUALLY REAL AND</p><p>TRUE. IS THERE ANYTHING TO BE UNDERSTOOD OR DONE ABOUT</p><p>THIS?</p><p>Whenever you come across a contradiction, watch very carefully. There
is bound to be something of great significance. Never avoid
contradictions, because life is contradictory. Life exists through the
tension of contradiction. So whenever you come across a contradiction
you are very close to the source of life. Let that be always
remembered.</p><p>The ordinary reaction is whenever you come across a contradiction you
start trying to solve it, start finding explanations for it, or start
dropping it into the unconscious so you need not worry about it. You
start doing something about it immediately the moment you feel some
contradiction because you have been taught to live noncontradictorily.
You have been taught a Osho - The First Principle</p><p>129</p><p>Chapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial</p><p>very dangerous thing. Nobody can live noncontradictorily. If you want
to live you have to live through contradiction, AS contradiction.</p><p>You have been taught to be consistent; that's why you have become
false. This is the whole trick. How does such great hypocrisy exist in
the world? Why? Why has the whole world turned out to be hypocritical?
There is a trick to it, a great trick; a great technology is behind it.
The technology is: teach people to be consistent, and they will become
hypocrites.</p><p>Because life exists through contradiction.</p><p>Life is inconsistent. One moment this, another moment that; life is
that way. One moment you are feeling loving, another moment you hate the
same person; life is like that. Now, you have been taught if you love,
then love always. What happens? You cannot love always, so only one
thing is possible: when hate comes you hide the hate, you repress the
hate, and you go on pretending love. This is what hypocrisy is. When you
don't love you pretend.</p><p>You are full of hate for your wife, but you come home and you hug her
and you kiss her and you inquire, "How are you, honey?" and all that.
And deep down you are hating her and you want to kill her. In fact, the
whole day you have been</p><p>fantasizing how to kill this woman.</p><p>But you have been taught to be consistent. So, once, you had fallen
in love, and you have said things in those love moments and you have
promised that "I will love you forever and ever" --</p><p>now you have to be consistent.</p><p>What will you do with your hate that is bound to arise? Each love
object is bound to be the hate object too. If you want not to hate, then
you will have to stop loving. If you really want not to hate anybody,
then you will have to stop loving, but you cannot love consistently. The
inconsistency will come up again and again.</p><p>It is as if somebody has told you, "If you see the day, don't see the
night. That is inconsistent." So what will you do? In the day you keep
your eyes open, in the night you keep your eyes closed and believe that
it is day. But the night comes; it doesn't follow your ideas. It has to
come. The night follows the day; the day follows the night.</p><p>You have been taught, "Be consistent." Your so-called character is
nothing but an effort to be consistent.</p><p>A real man cannot have any character. A real man is bound to be
characterless because to have a character means to have consistency. To
be characterless means to be free.</p><p>I said something yesterday. Now, if I have a character, I will try to
be consistent with my past; whatsoever I said yesterday, I have to say
the same thing today. But then I have to repeat my past. I cannot live
in the moment and I cannot live in the present.</p><p>In fact, a consistent man is one who goes on changing his past into
his future, who goes on putting his past as his future, ahead of
himself. That is the man of character, consistent man.</p><p>An inconsistent man is one who never allows the past to become his
future, who remains free for the future, who has no promises to keep,
who has no commitment with the past. Whenever it was, he lived it
totally; gone, it is gone.</p><p>A real man will love you and will hate you too. And sometimes he will
say, "I will love you always"; and sometimes he will say, "I cannot love
you again. Impossible." Sometimes he will be in a deep honeymoon with
you and sometimes in a deep divorce, and both things will go like day
and night. A real marriage is a continuous honeymoon and divorce, and
honeymoon and divorce. Mini honeymoons, mini divorces; big honeymoons,
big divorces. It continues like day and night.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 130</p><p>Chapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial</p><p>So whenever you come across a contradiction, be watchful, be very
alert. You are very close to life. And when you are consistent you are
just false, a plastic thing, you are not real.</p><p>I don't teach consistency. I teach the freedom of being inconsistent.
I teach the freedom of being contradictory. That's my whole approach
towards life.</p><p>Of course, you are afraid of being contradictory because then you
will not know who you are. With character there is something, something
very secure: you know who you are. You have a label: a good man, a bad
man, a saint, a sinner. You can believe in your identity when you are
consistent -- that you are a good husband, a good Christian, a
churchgoer, and this and that. With the inconsistency your identity
disappears; you don't know who you are. You become an opening, you are
no more closed, you have an open future. You don't know what you are
going to do the next moment; only the next moment will tell. To live in
that insecurity needs courage.</p><p>Sannyas is what I propose. Sannyas means to remain in insecurity;
sannyas means not to allow your past to influence your future, not to
allow your past to project itself into the future.</p><p>Let the dead bury the dead. The past is gone, gone. Don't cling to
it, and don't help it to cling to you.</p><p>The moment something has passed it has passed. Be completely clean of
it and be free and fresh again; then you will be real, authentically
real, and there will be</p><p>joy, and there will be celebration and song. I am not saying you will
not ever be sad, no. You will be sad. The false man is never sad --
because he is never happy. The false man just remains in the middle,
never happy, never sad. He is simply so-so, lukewarm; he is never too
cold and never too hot. He is just "okay". He somehow manages. He has a
comfortable life, but no real life.</p><p>I am not saying that the real man will always be happy. I am saying
the real man will always be real. When he is sad he will be really sad.
He will sing a song -- of sadness. He will accept his sadness as part of
life, as part of growth. He will not reject it. If he feels like crying
he will cry; he will not say, "What am I doing? This is not good. Only
women cry, and I am a man." He will not say that. He will say, "If my
eyes want to cry and the tears are rolling down, good. I have to be
real. I am only whatsoever I am." He will cry. His tears will be
true.</p><p>Your smiles are false, your tears are false. You manage to smile, and
you manage to cry too. So you live an empty life. The real man's life
will be full, sometimes full of joy and sometimes full of sadness.</p><p>And the real man one day becomes enlightened. The unreal man never
becomes enlightened. When the real man becomes enlightened, then there
is no joy and no sadness.</p><p>Then his being is just a witness. Joy comes: he watches it. Sadness
comes: he watches it.</p><p>Now, these are the three stages. The false man: his joy is just a
show, a mask, his sadness too; he pretends. The real man, the second
stage: he is natural, spontaneous; his joy is true, his sadness is true.
You can trust him. When he is crying, his whole heart is crying; and
when he smiles, his whole heart is smiling. And the second stage is a
must to attain to the third, the enlightened man. The enlightened man is
neither sad nor happy. He has attained to the witnessing soul; he simply
watches. He knows the sadness has come, the happiness has come, but
these are like climates that come and go and change, and he remains
centered.</p><p>The false man cannot jump to the enlightened state; hence I teach the
real man, but the real man is not the goal.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 131</p><p>Chapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial</p><p>That's why my work goes beyond the Encounter ideology, Gestalt
ideology. The Gestalt ideology or the Encounter ideology stops at the
real man. Good. Better than the unreal. But not enough. Something has
yet to happen. I use Encounter groups, Gestalt groups, and all the
therapies that have become available in the West. They are perfectly
beautiful; they bring you from the first, false state to the authentic,
real state. But my work goes beyond them. But I can go beyond only if
you have gone through the second stage. From the first there is no way,
from the false there is no way, to enlightenment; only from the real is
there a way.</p><p>You will have to go through the ecstasy of the real and the agony of
the real. When you have lived deeply all the realities of life, the
witness will arise. It arises naturally, out of being real.</p><p>So you say, "Usually I am 'this way' or 'that way'." That is not a
good way. You get fixed with one thing, this way or that. Become more
fluid, remain more fluid, because life is not solid; it is fluid, it is
flow. And that's what is happening and is confusing you.</p><p>"But for some time I have experienced all kinds of contradictions,
simultaneously." Good.</p><p>You are blessed. This confusion is the beginning of a great journey,
a great pilgrimage. If you become afraid you will go back to the
false.</p><p>The false is secure. Let me remind you again and again: the false is
comfortable. A good way to die is the false, but not a good way to live.
Even your death will be false, because how can the death be real? When
you have not lived really, how can you die really?</p><p>So many people die, but rarely does a real death happen. When a
Buddha dies it is a real death, or when Lin Chi dies it is a real death.
There are very few deaths which are real, because there are very few
lives which are real. You only pretend to live, and then one day you
pretend to die.</p><p>I have heard, a man met an old friend on the road, and the old friend
was a very, very fanatical Christian Scientist. The old friend asked
this man, "How is your father now?" and the man said, "He is very ill."
The Christian Scientist, of course, to be consistent with his
philosophy, said, "He is not ill. He only thinks</p><p>he is ill."</p><p>That is the Christian Scientists' ideology, that you only think that
you are ill, that's why you are ill. You are not really ill. He said,
"He only thinks he is ill. He is not really ill."</p><p>After eight days, these two men met again, and the Christian
Scientist asked again, "How is your father now?"</p><p>And the young man hesitated a little, and then he said, "Now he
thinks he is dead." -- to be consistent with this old man's
ideology.</p><p>The father has died, but this is a reality.</p><p>You go on living in a fantasy world. Your life is nothing but your
thinking, a pseudo thing; and so is your death. Your illness, your
health, your happiness, your sadness are all so bogus that how can you
die a real death? A real death has to be earned. One has to become
worthy of real death. And one becomes worthy only by living truly.</p><p>Now you are very close to a great source of light. That's why you are
feeling all sorts of contradictions simultaneously. That means your
solidity is melting. Your hate and love are not categorized as two
anymore. They are not put into boxes separately anymore; they are
merging with each other. The profound and the trivial are coming
together, and you are confused because now you cannot label what is
what.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 132</p><p>Chapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial</p><p>"I have experienced all kinds of contradictions, simultaneously. I
see women as objects of worship, and at the same time I lust after
them." That's what has happened down the ages.</p><p>There are two things man has done with woman: either he has worshiped
woman as a goddess or he has condemned woman as a witch. Either he has
exploited the woman for his lust or he has touched her feet and said,
"You are divine. Divine</p><p>mother." Either the woman has been a prostitute or a divine mother.
Man has not accepted woman just as human.</p><p>And woman is human, as human as you are. She is neither a divine
mother nor is she a prostitute, but that's how the mind goes on. The
mind makes things different, separate, puts them in categories. You have
killed the real woman, because the real woman is both, the prostitute
and the divine mother, together, simultaneously. If you fall in love
with a prostitute you will find a divine mother. Even a prostitute will
turn into a divine mother if you are in love with her; you will not find
the prostitute. And fall in love with a divine mother and you will find
the prostitute too.</p><p>What I am saying is that life is not so small as to be put into boxes
-- that this is a prostitute and this is a divine mother. Life is vast,
so big. It contains contradictions. And that is the beauty of life and
that is the richness of life.</p><p>Man has been changing between these polarities. Sometimes he calls
the woman the divine mother. That too is inhuman, because then you put
the woman on a pedestal and you don't allow her to be human. Watch. When
you force a woman to be a divine mother, what are you doing? You are not
allowing her to be human. And she will pretend that she is a divine
mother, so if you want to make love to her she will be reluctantly
ready. She will say no, and she will mean yes. She has to say no; she is
the divine mother.</p><p>A good woman has to be a dead woman. Even while you are making love,
she will lie down there like a corpse. A slight movement, and you will
become afraid: so are you wrong, she is not so good, not so virtuous? If
she starts enjoying your lovemaking, you will think that she is a bad
woman. Only bad women enjoy lovemaking, not good women. Good women?</p><p>They don't think of sex at all.</p><p>Look at the trick. You put the woman so high; then you don't allow
her to be human. You have made her "superhuman". That is a way to make
her inhuman. Or you force her to be a prostitute; that is again a way,
to put her below the human, to make her again inhuman. Then you go to
the prostitute, you give her the money, you make love to her -- with no
responsibility, with no love. It is simple, pure lust, but you know that
that woman is a bad woman. How can you love her? You feel good, there is
no problem. You can lust after this woman and</p><p>you can use her as a thing. She is just a prostitute, not a human
being; you don't relate to her. You just go and do things to her, pay
the price, and you are finished. Next day in the marketplace, you will
not even recognize her.</p><p>In both these ways you have turned the woman into inhuman beings.
Both are ugly.</p><p>The woman is both: the divine mother and the prostitute. Just as you
are both: God and animal.</p><p>Let me repeat: the profane is the sacred, the samsara is the
nirvana.</p><p>Through these categories ... The reality is so complex and so deep it
cannot be categorized, it cannot be demarked into definitions. No woman
is just a prostitute and no woman is just a divine mother. And that is
true about man, the same way. Once you see this, you are freed from
categories, logical boxes, pigeonholes, and you can see reality as it
is.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 133</p><p>Chapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial</p><p>A woman is a human being, as you are a human being. Yes sometimes she
is a witch; just as sometimes you are mean, ugly, horrible, she is too.
And sometimes she is ecstasy, pure ecstasy. Sometimes she is the most
beautiful phenomenon on the earth, just as you are.</p><p>In India we have the right representation, the symbol of Kali. You
must have seen the pictures of Kali or the statues of Kali. That is
really a great understanding about women. Kali is painted as black, as
black as the devil -- "kali" means "black" -- and yet she is the divine
mother. And she is most beautiful. She is black, as black as the devil,
but her form is that of the divine. She has a beautiful face, a
beautiful body, absolutely in proportion; but she is black. And then,
she is dancing on the chest of her husband, almost killing him. Shiva is
her husband, and she is dancing on his chest and almost killing him. And
she loves him too. She loves and kills together. All contradictions put
together.</p><p>The mother gives you birth, the woman gives you birth, and by and by
the woman kills you too. She brings your death closer; hence the
attraction and the fear. You are attracted with the divine, and you are
afraid with the devilish.</p><p>So you say, "I see women as objects of worship, and at the same time
I lust after them."</p><p>Both are complementaries. Accept them. That's how reality is. The
woman is both, and you are both. And if you accept this contradictory
reality, one day you will go beyond it, you will transcend it.</p><p>There is a transcendental element too, but that transcendental
element can be understood only when you pass through contradictions. If
you avoid contradictions you will never attain the transcendental. Go
through the contradictory, and by and by you will become just a witness
to them both.</p><p>How does it work? It works in a simple way. If you think you are
good, you are identified with good. If you think you are bad, you are
identified with the bad. But if you allow both good and bad together,
you cannot get identified with either. You remain unidentified, and that
is the fundamental, the radical change. You remain unidentified. You
cannot figure out who you are, good or bad, day or night, life or death,
beautiful or ugly. You cannot identify with anything, so you remain
unidentified.</p><p>Good comes and passes, and you know you cannot be good, because the
bad is coming.</p><p>And the bad comes and passes, and you know you cannot be the bad.
either, because the good is coming. So you cannot be good and you cannot
be bad; then who are you? You are a witness. a witness who watches
everything come and go, a watcher on the hills.</p><p>"I am content to let life flow, and I am afraid of the future." The
same. The same contradiction on so many levels.</p><p>"I crave to be alone, and I crave to be always with people." The
same.</p><p>"I feel bizarre because these contradictions all seem equally real
and true." They are. And when for the first time you recognize that they
are true and real, one feels bizarre. That's what the Zen people say:
first the rivers are rivers and the</p><p>mountain are mountains, then the rivers are no more rivers and the
mountains are no more mountains -- bizarre, confusion, clouds,
everything topsy-turvy, all disturbed -- and then one day mountains are
again mountains and rivers are again rivers, everything settled again,
on a higher plane of course, on the transcendental plane of course.</p><p>You will have to go through this bizarreness. To be sane one has to
pass through many insanities.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 134</p><p>Chapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial</p><p>"Is there anything to be understood or done about this?" Just
understood, nothing to be done about it. I don't teach doing. Nothing
has to be done. You just watch. Watch more and more carefully, watch in
detail. Watch the subtlest nuance of any change in you. Watch all --</p><p>which no prejudice, with no judgement. And that watching will
integrate you, will make you more and more aware.</p><p>And that is the whole purpose of life: to create more intelligence,
to create more awareness.</p><p>Question</p><p>IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN GIVE YOU BACK?</p><p>Nothing, because that is what I give to you. I give you nothing, and
only nothing can you give me back.</p><p>In fact, don't start thinking of giving me anything back, because I
am not giving you anything. I am simply making you aware of things that
you already have. You don't owe anything to me, not even a thank-you. If
you thank me, that is simply generous of you, you are just being polite
and gentlemanly; otherwise there is nothing. You don't owe anything to
me. I have not given anything to you and I am not going to give anything
to you, and nothing can be given, in the very nature of things.</p><p>In fact, if you are not angry at me, I will be happy enough. Because
I take away many things. I don't give anything to you. I take away your
ego, and I don't give anything instead. I take away a thousand and one
things. And when those thousand and one things have been taken away,
suddenly you become aware of that which has always been there from the
very beginning.</p><p>So let me say it in this way: I give you that which you already have,
and I take away things which you don't have but you think you have. I
take away that which is not there but you believe is there. I take away
your illusions.</p><p>But I cannot give reality. Reality is that which cannot be given; it
is already there. I eliminate the illusion, and the reality is there. I
simply give you back to yourself.</p><p>There is no need to be worried -- "Is there anything I can give you
back.?" Just if you are not angry, that will be enough. If you can
forgive me, that will be enough.</p><p>I know it is very difficult to forgive me. That is the greatest
danger a Master takes on his shoulders. It is very difficult for the
disciples to forgive him, and they are always watching from the corner
of their eyes to find some fault. They are always waiting to find some
loophole so they can jump upon it and they can say, "So, I have found
the reality. This man is nothing," and they can go and condemn. It is a
very dangerous game.</p><p>The disciples are continuously watchful. They are like spies, spying
on the Master, if they can find something.</p><p>Just the other question-answer day, when I talked about Dr. Kovoor,
two, three persons got almost mad about me. They have written letters
that "Why did you do this? It is cheap!" And I go on telling you the
cheap is the costly! And the trivial is the profound! And the world, the
samsara, is nirvana! Do you hear me, or not? And they have demanded,
almost it is a demand, Osho - The First Principle</p><p>135</p><p>Chapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial</p><p>that "You have to answer it, why you attacked him." I have not
attacked him; I</p><p>have attacked these three people who have written to me. What have I
to do with Kovoor? He is not going to come here, I am not going to go
there. We are not going to meet anyway. I have attacked these three
persons, and I have got them, trapped them, they are trapped. I have
attacked their idea of me.</p><p>One has written, "It is inconceivable that a man of your height
should come so low." But who in the first place has told you that I am a
man of height? You yourself project, and if your projections are
destroyed, you are angry at me?</p><p>I go on repeating, just to be safe, that I am a very ordinary man.
Otherwise you will hang me in the sky. You will say, "You are so
high."</p><p>If you find me eating or if you find me taking a bath ... Do you
know? In heaven there is no provision for God's bathroom. No provision.
I have gone through all the scriptures.</p><p>Can you believe God farts? Impossible. So high, and farting?
Belching? These things are good for human beings, not for gods.</p><p>Who has told you I am so high? But you project.</p><p>And I am not so foolish as to accept your projections. If you want to
project such things, you will have to find some other people. You are
not allowed to project anything on me. I will go on throwing it. I am
not here to fulfill any of your expectations. That is the very trouble
you have to tolerate with me. You would like me to be dead and sitting
on a golden throne, and then you can worship me easily. But I am
alive.</p><p>And I go on doing things that I like. I don't care what you think. If
you are disturbed it is your problem; it is none of my business. Then
you have to look into yourself and find ways not to be disturbed.</p><p>These things come again and again in your mind, and you don't see
that they are YOUR</p><p>problems.</p><p>Somebody else has asked, "Why do we have to pay money here?" "I have
no money," he says, "and I want to be here." But then who is going to
pay for you? You will need money, you will need food, you will need a
shelter, you will need</p><p>clothes, sometimes you will be ill, you will need the hospital: who
is going to pay for you? Now, he thinks that this ashram is money
obsessed. If people who don't have money are allowed, then Laxmi will
have to go even more money obsessed because for them also she will have
to arrange. Just to avoid money obsession, money has to be arranged.
There are many people who would like to be here, but then who is going
to arrange for them? And if somebody else arranges for them, he will
demand something in return.</p><p>The person says, "Even Christians don't ask for money; even they are
not that bold." I know they are not that bold. They need not be; they
have enough money. The Vatican has enough money; that is the richest
party in the world. But then you have to pay -- not in money, money is
there -- you have to pay with other things: you have to pay with your
freedom.</p><p>Here I want you to be free. I don't want to hinder your freedom.</p><p>If you want to stay here without money, then I will have to ask some
people who have money to give money to the ashram. But then they have
their conditions. Then their conditions have to be fulfilled. Otherwise
why should they give their money? They give money in return for
something. Then you will not be free here. And I will not be free here.
I will not be able to Osho - The First Principle</p><p>136</p><p>Chapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial</p><p>say what I want to say. Then they will dictate to me that this has to
be said and this has not to be said.</p><p>Nobody is money obsessed. But the questioner is money obsessed: he
has no money and he wants to be here. But what is money? Money is just
that you have to pay for everything.</p><p>You eat: you have to pay for it. You live: you have to pay for it.
You need clothes: you have to pay for it.</p><p>And why should you not pay? Then somebody else will have to pay for
you. Why exploit somebody else?</p><p>If you don't have money, then go and earn money and come back. YOU
are</p><p>money obsessed! But you think that Bhagwan is demanding money. It is
your problem.</p><p>Somebody has said, "I can't see the point why I have to pay when I
come to the lecture.</p><p>When I have to pay ten rupees for the lecture, then I cannot think of
you as God." So the price of thinking of me as God is ten rupees! If he
does not have to pay, he will think of me as God.</p><p>What do you think? You are trying to bribe me? Pay twenty rupees and
think of me as the devil, perfectly okay!</p><p>Why should you not pay? Why should you like to exploit?</p><p>And this is my understanding, that you hear only when you pay;
otherwise you don't hear.</p><p>When you have nothing to pay, there is no need to hear. The more you
pay, the more alert you are -- because those ten rupees are gone. If you
don't listen it is your business; you remain a little alert. J know you
are money-minded; those ten rupees will keep you awake.</p><p>And my godhood is not in danger, because I don't care what you think
about me. That is not the point at all. It is not that you have made me
a god. This is my declaration; it is not your recognition. If nobody
believes in me, then too I am a god. If only I believe in me, that's
enough. I don't need a single witness. This is MY understanding.</p><p>Then again, the moment you think that this man is Bhagwan, then he
should behave in such a way and in such a way. Then he should be on a
high pedestal. He should not behave like a human being.</p><p>Then you don't understand my concept of Bhagwan. My concept of
Bhagwan is not that a Bhagwan is a special being, that a Bhagwan is a
perfect being, that a Bhagwan is not of this world. My concept of
Bhagwan is that God is a normal quality of existence. Just by being, you
are God.</p><p>You are not a painter by just being. For painting, you will have to
learn some skill, you will have to go to an art school. And then too
your being a painter will</p><p>depend on so many recognitions -- people will recognize, may not
recognize; the critics will appreciate, may not appreciate; a thousand
and one things. If you want to be a musician, just by being, you are not
a musician. You will have to learn; this is something which has to be
learned.</p><p>When I say God, I mean you ARE God, just by being. It is not a
specialization.</p><p>Then what is the difference between me and you? The only difference
is that I recognize my godhood and you don't recognize yours. Otherwise
there is no distinction. I am as imperfect as you are! Then what is the
difference between me and you? The difference is that I enjoy my
imperfection and you don't enjoy yours, that I am perfectly happy with
all my imperfections and you are not happy with yours. You have a notion
of perfection and I have Osho - The First Principle</p><p>137</p><p>Chapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial</p><p>none. I am perfect in my imperfections. I have accepted them totally,
in toto. I am not trying to improve myself; I am simply the way I am.
And I am happy the way I am.</p><p>The day you are also happy the way you are, the day you are also
happy with all your imperfections, you are God. You are still God,
whether you recognize it or you don't recognize it, but you have your
ideas about God, and then you project those ideas. And if, sometimes,
they are shattered -- and they will be shattered again and again because
I cannot keep to your expectations ...</p><p>I am a free man. I live the way I live. And see the whole point: I am
not expecting anything from you; still you go on expecting things from
me. My whole effort here is to help you to be yourself, and your whole
effort here is to make me something that you want me to be. Drop all
this nonsense.</p><p>That's why I say even if you can forgive me, that will be enough. You
need not even say a thank-you.</p><p>It is very difficult to be safe amongst disciples; hence I need
bodyguards. Because a disciple has "surrendered," now he will take
revenge. And of course, if he surrenders to me, he will take revenge on
me. Where else will he go to take the revenge?</p><p>Watch all these tendencies in you.</p><p>It was not Kovoor, it was not my criticism of Kovoor, that has hurt
you. It is your idea of me, it is your expectation of me, that is
feeling hurt. So drop the expectations; otherwise you will feel hurt
again and again -- I will find other Kovoors. Sometimes, even if they
are not there, I can invent! But I am going to destroy all your
expectations of me because if you cannot drop expectations about me, how
can you drop expectations about yourself? It will be impossible.</p><p>And my whole work consists in a simple thing: to live a life without
expectations, without hope, to live a life moment to moment, with no
ideals.</p><p>Two men were chatting when the name of a mutual friend was mentioned.
"Are you a friend of Harry's?" the first asked.</p><p>"Are we friends?" the man said. "Twenty years we are friends. There
is nothing I would not do for Harry and there is nothing he would not do
for me. In fact, for twenty years we have gone through life together,
doing absolutely nothing for each other."</p><p>I am doing nothing to you. You, please, do nothing to me. Even if
this can happen, there will arise a great friendship. You need not feel
obliged; you don't owe anything to me.</p><p>Question</p><p>MEHER BABA REMAINED SILENT FOR THE LAST FORTY-FIVE YEARS OF HIS</p><p>LIFE. PLEASE COMMENT ON ITS IMPLICATIONS.</p><p>There is nothing much in it. He just got fed up with the questions of
his disciples.</p><p>And sometimes the idea arises in me too. So watch. Osho - The First
Principle</p><p>138</p><p>Chapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial Question</p><p>OSHO, THERE ARE A FEW WORDS YOU ALWAYS PRONOUNCE WRONGLY.</p><p>WHY?</p><p>So that you can say to people that at least in one thing Osho is
consistent.</p><p>My English is not that of the Englishman; my English is not that of
the American; it is not even of the Indian. My English is just MINE. So
you have to tolerate it. And I am very reluctant to improve about
anything.</p><p>And my English has been of a great help to me. I used to live in
Jabalpur, for many years.</p><p>The first day I was driving to the university, a woman, who lived
next to me, an American woman, she wanted a lift. Now, this was going to
be dangerous. This was the first day -- and every day then I will have
to carry her and tolerate her chattering for almost half an hour, going
to the university and coming.</p><p>I had heard the American expression "Can I drop you off somewhere?"
but I managed it into my English and I asked her, "Can I throw you down
someplace?" And finished! She never asked again.</p><p>Once, another, an Englishwoman, got interested in me. I don't know
what she saw in me, but she was almost in a fantasy. She was a lecturer
in the same university, in the English department. She was after me. I
was simply surprised as to what she saw in me because I don't see
anything in myself; it is just emptiness there. But my English
helped.</p><p>You know the expression ...? I had read somewhere, in a novel, that a
young man gazes into the eyes of his woman and says to her that "Your
face, your beauty, your joy, your presence make time stand still." So I
did the same to this woman.</p><p>I told her, "You have such a face that it would stop a clock." And
finished! My English helped me.</p><p>Sometimes you will find it difficult too, because my structure of the
sentences is mine, and sometimes the meaning I put into words is mine,
the pronunciations are mine; sometimes you can't even get what I am
saying. That helps you to keep awake. You have to listen attentively;
you can miss. You cannot take me for granted.</p><p>One man was discussing with me about a politician, and I told the
man, "That politician is a spherical S.O.B."</p><p>The man was puzzled; he said, "I have come across many S.O.B.'s in my
life. But what do you mean by 'spherical'?"</p><p>"I mean," I said to him, "he is an S.O.B. any way you look at him."
"Spherical," that is my own word.</p><p>And my English has a certain reputation, and I am not going to
destroy it.</p><p>A little lady from Fresno, visiting San Francisco, got quite a thrill
out of attending a daring party in the Bohemia known as Telegraph
Hill.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 139</p><p>Chapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial</p><p>A friend who was showing her the sights pointed out a
familiar-looking young couple and whispered, "Don't look now, but those
two artists there are living in sin."</p><p>"Sin, my foot!" exclaimed the Fresno lady. "I know them. It is just
Lois and Maurice, and they were married in the Fresno Baptist Church
five years ago."</p><p>The young couple overheard and quickly drew the Fresno lady aside.
"For God's sake don't tell anybody we are married," said the young man
in a tense undertone. "It would ruin our artistic reputation."</p><p>I have a certain reputation of my English, hmm? And I am not going to
change it in any way.</p><p>Question</p><p>WHAT IS PORNOGRAPHY, AND WHY DOES IT HAVE SO MUCH APPEAL?</p><p>Pornography is a by-product of religious repression. The whole credit
goes to the priests.</p><p>Pornography has nothing to do with pornographers. The pornography is
created, managed by the Church, by the religious people.</p><p>In a primitive, natural state, man is not pornographic. When human
beings are naked and nude and man knows the woman's body and woman knows
the man's body, you cannot sell PLAYBOY. It is impossible. Who will
purchase PLAYBOY? And who will look into all that crap?</p><p>They have repressed so much that man's mind is fascinated of
pornography. The whole credit goes to them. They have repressed so much
that man's mind is boiling. The man wants to see the woman's body.
Nothing wrong in it, a simple desire, a human desire. And the woman
wants to know the man's body. A simple desire, nothing wrong about
it.</p><p>Just think of a world where trees are covered with clothes. There are
people ... I have heard about some English ladies who cover their dogs
and cats with clothes. Just think, cows and horses and dogs dressed.
Then you will find new pornography arising. Somebody will publish a NUDE
picture of a tree -- and you will hide it in a Bible and look at it!</p><p>This whole foolishness is out of religious repression.</p><p>Make man free, allow people to be nude. I am not saying they should
continuously be nude, but nudity should be accepted. On the beach, at
the swimming pool, in the home ...</p><p>nudity should be accepted. The children should take a bath with the
mother, with the father, in the bathroom. There is no need for the
father to lock the bathroom when he goes in. The children can come and
have a talk and chitchat and go out. Pornography will disappear.</p><p>Each child wants to know. "How does my daddy look?" Each child wants
to</p><p>know, "How does my mother look?" And this is simply intelligence,
curiosity. And the child cannot know what the mother looks like, and the
child cannot know what the father looks like; now you are creating
illness in the child's mind. It is YOU, that YOU are ill, and the
illness will be reflected in the child's mind.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 140</p><p>Chapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial</p><p>I am not saying sit nude in the office or in the factory. If it is
hot, it is okay, but there is no need to be naked, it should not be an
obsession; but this continuous obsession of hiding your body is just
ugly.</p><p>And one thing more. Because of the clothes, bodies HAVE become ugly,
because then you don't care. You care only about the face. If your belly
goes on becoming bigger and bigger, who bothers? You can hide it. Your
body has become ugly because it is not exposed; otherwise you will think
a little: the belly is getting too big. Just let one hundred people
stand nude, and they all will be ashamed, and they will squirm and they
will start hiding themselves.</p><p>Something is wrong. Why is it so? They know only about their face.
The face they take care of; the whole body is neglected.</p><p>This is bad. This is not good. It is not in favor of the body,
either.</p><p>Any country where people are allowed a little freedom to be nude
becomes more beautiful; people have more beautiful bodies. If American
women are getting more beautiful and have more beautiful bodies there is
no wonder in it. Indian woman will have to wait long; they can hide
their ugly bodies in the saries very carefully. The sari is a great
help.</p><p>Nudity should be natural, should be as natural as animals, as trees,
as everything else is nude. Then pornography will disappear.</p><p>Pornography is there as a sort of mental masturbation; it is mind
masturbation. You are not allowed to love women, you are not allowed to
love men, you are not allowed to make as many contacts as possible; the
mind is boiling and starts a sort of inner masturbation.</p><p>Pornography helps you; it gives you visions of beautiful women and
beautiful men, to dream about, and it gives you a thrill.</p><p>Your alive wife does not give you any thrill. With your alive wife
you suddenly go dead.</p><p>There are people, even while making love to their wife, they are
imagining some other woman; they are imagining some PLAYBOY picture.
They can make love to their woman only when in their imagination there
is some other woman, some fantasy. Then they get thrilled. They are not
making love to their woman, and the woman is not making love to
them.</p><p>She may be thinking of some actor or some hero or somebody. There are
four people in each bed! Of course, it is too crowded, and you never
contact the real person; those imaginary ones are standing in
between.</p><p>You should know that masturbation -- mental or physical is a
perversion. It does not exist in nature. Homosexuality does not exist in
nature, but in zoos it comes into existence. In zoos animals start
masturbating. In zoos animals even start becoming homosexually
interested.</p><p>Wherever the situation is unnatural, unnatural perversions enter. In
the military, in the army, people become homosexual, because it is an
"all-boys" club, no woman available. Their pent-up energies start making
them insane; they think they will go mad if they don't allow some
outlet. In the boys' hostels, in the girls' hostels, where no boy can
come, no girl can come, the other sex is not allowed, naturally
pornography will be greatly enjoyed. It will help masturbation.</p><p>But these things have not been talked of directly. Now many will be
offended -- why am I talking about these things? I am here to make
everything clear to you so that you can become more and more natural.
The appeal for pornography simply says that your mind is in an abnormal
state. It is perfectly good to be interested in a beautiful woman,
nothing wrong, but to have a picture of a nude woman and to get excited
about it is just stupid. That's what people are doing with
pornography.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 141</p><p>Chapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial</p><p>I have heard a beautiful joke. Listen attentively, don't miss it.</p><p>A husband was suspicious of his wife, so he hired a private detective
to find out whether she had a lover or not. The detective, a Chinese
immigrant, came back to report after only two days. His arm and nose
were broken and his head was tied up in bandages.</p><p>"What happened?" the husband inquired eagerly. "Any proof yet?"</p><p>"Well," the detective answered, "I hid outside your house when you
left in the morning.</p><p>After half an hour a man came and let himself in with a key. I
climbed a tree to see into the bedroom, and there was he holding she and
she kissing he. So he play with she and she play with he; I play with me
and I fall down from the tree."</p><p>That's what pornography is.</p><p>Beware of all sorts of perversions. To love is good; to dream about
it is ugly. Why? When the real is available, why go for the unreal? Even
the real never satisfies! So how can the unreal satisfy? Even the real,
in the final analysis, proves to be illusory, so what to say about the
illusory?</p><p>Let me repeat: Even the real, one day, proves to be just unreal, so
what to say about the unreal?</p><p>Go into the real love, and you will become so aware one day that even
the real love, the so-called real love, will disappear. And when a man
is completely beyond sexuality ... Not that I am saying "TRY to go
beyond," no, not at all, God forbid. What I mean when I say when a man
"goes beyond" is that when a man has gone deeper into sex, into love,
and has known and has found that there is nothing, that very finding
takes him above. He starts floating above the earth, he grows wings.
That transcendence is BRAHMACHARYA, that transcendence is celibacy. It
has nothing to do with your effort; it has nothing to do with
repression.</p><p>A repressed person can never attain BRAHMACHARYA; he will become</p><p>pornographic.</p><p>And there are a thousand and one ways of being pornographic. In the
old Indian scriptures there are descriptions of great RISHIS sitting in
meditation and beautiful women trying to seduce them, dancing around
them, naked. And the stories say they are sent by the God of heaven to
corrupt them because the God in heaven is afraid if they attain to their
SAMADHI they will become competitors. The God of heaven is afraid of
their competition, so when they are attaining closer and closer, coming
closer to SAMADHI, he sends beautiful women to seduce them.</p><p>Now, there is no God, and no beautiful women come from heaven; this
is mind pornography. These RISHIS, these so-called seers, have repressed
sex so much that at the last moment, when they are really getting closer
to their innermost center, that repressed sex bursts forth, explodes.
And in that explosion their own images, mind images ... It is a mind
panorama, it is very colorful, and it is so colorful and looks so real
that even they are deceived; they think really women are there.</p><p>Just go in a cave for three months and be celibate and force
celibacy. After three months you will be a great seer -- and you will
start seeing things. That is what a great seer is. You will start seeing
damsels and beautiful APSARAS from heaven coming and dancing around Osho
- The First Principle</p><p>142</p><p>Chapter 8 - The Profound and the Trivial</p><p>you seducing you. They are just your mind picture. When you are
deprived of reality, your dreams start almost looking like reality.
That's what we call hallucination.</p><p>In those old days PLAYBOY magazine was not available, so the
RISHIMUNIS had to depend on their own. Now you can have some support
from the outside.</p><p>But beware: even the real is proved, finally, to be unreal. So don't
move into the realms of the unreal. Go into the real, let it be a great
experience. I am not against it, I am all for it, go into it, because
only by going into it, one day, BRAHMACHARYA, one day, you simply get
out of it.</p><p>Not that love will disappear. In fact, for the first time love will
appear, but a totally different kind of love. Buddha calls it compassion
-- a cool love, with no sexual heat in it.</p><p>Your being will become a benediction. Your very presence will make
people feel your love.</p><p>Your love will fall and shower on them. In your very presence, people
will start moving into the unknown.</p><p>Yes, great compassion will arise in you. It is the same sexual
energy, released from the sexual objects. Not repressed. Released. Not
forcibly repressed, but understandably released.</p><p>The same sexual energy becomes love, compassion.</p><p>And when love, compassion, arises you are fulfilled. Buddha has said
two things are the goals: awareness and compassion. And both come out of
the sex energy; both are born out of it. Those two are the flowers,
ultimate flowers, of sex energy.</p><p>That lotus is waiting in you to flower. Don't waste your energies.
Use your energies to understand them, go into them deeply, meditatively,
so that one day that lotus opens.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 143</p><p>Chapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is 9</p><p>You: the Greatest Lie There Is</p><p>19 April 1977 am in Buddha Hall</p><p>THE OFFICIAL, RIKO, ONCE ASKED NANSEN TO EXPLAIN TO HIM THE OLD</p><p>PROBLEM OF THE GOOSE IN THE BOTTLE.</p><p>"IF A MAN PUTS A GOSLING INTO A BOTTLE," SAID RIKO, "AND FEEDS
HIM</p><p>UNTIL HE IS FULL GROWN, HOW CAN THE MAN GET THE GOOSE OUT WITHOUT</p><p>KILLING IT OR BREAKING THE BOTTLE?"</p><p>NANSEN GAVE A GREAT CLAP WITH HIS HANDS AND SHOUTED, "RIKO!"</p><p>"YES, MASTER," SAID THE OFFICIAL WITH A START. "SEE," SAID NANSEN,
"THE GOOSE IS OUT!"</p><p>"I do not seek, I find", says Pablo Picasso. And I say to you: You
need not seek, because if you seek, you will never find it. And you need
not find it, also, because if YOU find it, it will not have been found
at all.</p><p>Seeking means the truth is not and you have to seek it. Seeking means
the truth is hidden and you have to seek it. Seeking means the truth is
far away, distant, and you have to journey to it. And truth is herenow.
No pilgrimage is needed; one has not to go anywhere. Truth is not THERE
and truth is not THEN. Truth is here and now, so all seeking is going
astray.</p><p>Seek, and you will not find, because in the very seeking you have
missed the point, you have missed the first principle. In the very
effort, you have gone away from the truth.</p><p>Seeking is a desire. With the desire comes in the mind -- mind is
nothing but desire.</p><p>Seeking is in the future, and the future is not. Truth is always
present, always present. Truth is always now; there is no other way for
truth to be. You cannot say about truth, "Truth was,"</p><p>and you cannot say about truth, "Truth will be." That will be
absolutely wrong. Truth IS -- and it is always so, and it will be always
so, and it has always been</p><p>so. Truth IS.</p><p>How can you seek that which is? One seeks that which is not yet.
Seeking is in the future.</p><p>Seeking assumes it, that it is not here. You seek money, you seek
power, you seek prestige, you seek heaven; but how can you seek truth?
That's why, let me repeat. seeking, you go astray. Seeking, you become a
victim of desire. Seeking, the mind becomes predominant.</p><p>Seeking, the secondary becomes primary and the primary is lost track
of.</p><p>And I say if YOU find it you have not found it at all. Because if YOU
remain to find it, then it cannot be truth. Truth is found only when you
are not. When truth is, you are not. You both cannot be present
together. You are the greatest lie there is. If you are still there,
then you will go on missing the truth. The very presence of you
functions as a barrier. "I" cannot find; when the "I" is not there it is
found.</p><p>That's why I say Picasso's statement is a half-truth. Half of it is
true: "I do not seek." But that half is untrue when he says, "I find."
It looks almost Zenlike, but it is not. A half-truth is Osho - The First
Principle</p><p>144</p><p>Chapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is</p><p>more dangerous than a plain lie because you can see the lie as the
lie sooner or later, but the half-truth can go on pretending to be the
whole truth; at least it appears like the truth. Many have been deceived
by Picasso's statement. It is almost Zen: "I do not seek, I find."</p><p>If he had said, "I do not seek, and it is found," it would have been
Zen. If the "I" remains, then truth will remain clouded. The "I"
functions as a cloud, and the sun goes behind. The "I"</p><p>functions as a darkness, as a vale of darkness. The "I" is very
noisy, and the voice of truth is very small, still. If the "I" is there
beating its drums, then it is almost impossible to hear the whispering
of truth.</p><p>Yes, truth is a whisper. You feel it only when you are absolutely
not. In your</p><p>absence it is present.</p><p>So this is the whole thing: if you are present, truth is absent; if
you are absent, truth is present. To be absent is all that meditation
is. To be absent is all that is involved in meditation.</p><p>How to become absent? How not to be? Yes, "To be or not to be" is the
question. And ordinarily we decide to be. The moment we decide to be,
the samsara. The moment we decide not to be, the nirvana. Yes, that is
the basic question that encounters every human being: to be or not to
be. A Buddha decides not to be.</p><p>And the paradox is that those who decide not to be, they become true,
and those who decide to be, they become a lie. The lie can persist; you
can go on feeding it.</p><p>Truth is, just is, only is. Seeking, you miss it. Seeking, you have
started looking somewhere else. Seeking, you don't look HERE. Seeking,
your eyes are turned upwards towards the sky. That's why whenever we
think of God we look upwards towards the sky. It is very significant:
God is far away, sitting in the seventh heaven, up. It is a long
journey; only very rare people can do it -- saints, mahatmas, ascetics.
All nonsense.</p><p>God is where you are right now! Not in the seventh heaven, but within
you.</p><p>But about those seven heavens, the metaphor of "seven" is beautiful.
God is not in the seventh heaven somewhere, but is hidden behind seven
layers of lies. There is a very strange incident in Bodhidharma's life,
the founder of Zen. It is said that Bodhidharma collapsed seven times
and arose eight times, when he realized enlightenment. Collapsed seven
times and arose eight times. Very significant. Those are the seven
layers of the ego, the seven layers of the "I". Each "I" will help you
to collapse, and if you cannot rise eight times, that means if you
cannot rise at least one time without the ego, you will not attain.</p><p>So the whole question is not that the truth is very far. It is very
close, very, very close. It is in you, it is you, it is your intrinsic
nature, it is your DHARMA. That is the first principle, but somehow,
seeking, you have missed it.</p><p>Seeking, you have been for many lives. A seeker you have been.
Nonseeking will reveal it.</p><p>That's why I say seeking, you go astray. Seeking, you go in dreams.
How can you seek God? You have not known. How can you seek the unknown?
You have never seen. How can you seek the unseen? Even if God comes
across you, you will not be able to recognize him, because recognition
is possible only if you have experienced him before. And you have not
experienced him. He may have come across you many times in your life,
and you will go on missing because how will you recognize him?</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 145</p><p>Chapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is</p><p>It is impossible to seek the unknown. Then what do you do? First you
create a dream about the unknown and you start seeking the dream. The
Hindu has one dream of God, the Mohammedan has another dream, the
Christian has still another -- but those are all dreams.</p><p>The Christian will attain to his dream. That is the misery, because
if you persist too much, your dream will start becoming almost a
reality. If you pour your energy into your dream too much, then your
dream will start becoming a reality; you will convert it into a reality.
But it is not reality; it is still a dream.</p><p>The fight between Hindus, Mohammedans, and Christians is not the
fight about reality.</p><p>The fight is about their different dreams. Hindus have a certain idea
of God, so have others, and they fight. They say, "Our dream is true."
When a Christian meditates deeply, he comes to see Jesus. A Jaina never
comes to see Jesus, never. A Buddhist never comes to see Jesus; Jesus
never crosses his path. For a Buddhist, Buddha comes on the path. For a
Jaina, Mahavir crosses his path. They are their dreams; they are dreams
and projections and desires. And if you persist too much, the mind has
the faculty to impart reality to the dream.</p><p>You do it every day, so it is not something very strange. Every day
in the night when you fall asleep you dream, and in the dream you never
recognize the fact that it is a dream. In the dream it looks true. In
the dream it looks real -- howsoever absurd. In the dream you see a dog
is walking, and suddenly the dog becomes a cat, and you don't even doubt
that it is possible. In the dream you</p><p>accept even that. Your acceptance, your capacity to believe, is
tremendous.</p><p>Even the people who think they are skeptical, people who think they
are great doubters, logicians, rationalists, even in their dreams all
their rationalism is gone and all their doubt disappears. In their
dreams they believe absurd things. In the morning, when they are awake,
they will be amazed, but then it is too late.</p><p>Just think of a person who is in a coma ... Once a woman was brought
to me who had been in a coma for nine months. Now think, if she is
dreaming for nine months, she must be thinking they are realities. A man
can be in a coma for nine years, or ninety years -- or for nine lives.
Then? The dream will look real. In fact, if this woman is awakened out
of her coma for one minute and she looks around and falls into her dream
again, which will be more real, her dream that has lasted for nine
months, or the reality that she saw for one single minute? What will be
her conclusion if she can conclude? She will conclude that she had
fallen for one minute into sleep and she saw a dream and again the dream
is gone, so she is awake and her reality continues.</p><p>The greatest possibility of the mind and the greatest capacity of the
mind is imagination. It lives through imagination. The moment you start
seeking truth you are moving in the direction of imagination. What are
you seeking?</p><p>Zen says there is nothing to seek, because you don't know what is
there. So if you seek, you will miss. Now, this is a very much higher
standpoint. Jesus says, "Seek, and you will find." A very much lower
statement, nothing to be compared with Zen. Meaningful, meaningful for
those who are starting on the journey, but if you follow Jesus, one day
or other, you will understand that by seeking, you cannot reach. Jesus
was talking to people who were not highly evolved, people who had not
even started seeking. He had to teach them: "Seek and you will find,
knock and the door shall be opened unto you, ask and it shall be given
to you."</p><p>If you go to a Zen Master he will smile; he will say, "Start,"
because his statement is a higher statement. When you have sought and
you have not found, when you have struggled hard and nothing comes in
your hands except dreams, then the Zen Master's approach will become
Osho - The First Principle</p><p>146</p><p>Chapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is</p><p>possible, you will be able to understand it. Then he will say, "Seek,
and you will not find.</p><p>Now, please, drop seeking. Drop seeking and find it herenow!"</p><p>But I am not saying that Jesus is wrong. I am saying it is a
beginners' class. And unless you follow Jesus for a time you will not
understand Zen. So Jesus will prepare you, Jesus will help you.</p><p>Jesus was talking to the Jews, who have been one of the most earthy
races in the world. To talk Zen would have been impossible -- they would
have killed him even earlier. They didn't allow him much life, only
three years of ministry. At the age of thirty he started his work; by
thirty-three he was gone. They could not tolerate even a very primary
statement about religion.</p><p>It was not very rebellious, it was not very absurd. It was in tune
with the Jewish thinking, but still they could not tolerate it. It was
"otherworldly". He was talking about the world that he calls the Kingdom
of God. Jews have been very worldly; that is their success. They are
very down to earth, and this man was distracting them. They were seeking
money and they were seeking power and prestige, and this man was talking
about God. Jesus was trying to change their seeking towards religion. It
is religion of the kindergarten class.</p><p>Zen people are talking about the highest statement. India's highest
consciousness was transplanted into China, and China's highest
consciousness, Taoism, met with Buddhism.</p><p>These are two of the greatest flowerings of human consciousness.
Never again has humanity reached such a peak as Buddhism, as it reached
in Buddha; and never again has it reached anything like Lao Tzu. And
just think: Zen is a crossbreeding of Taoism and Buddhism. It is a
meeting of Buddha and Lao Tzu. It is a meeting of two of the highest
peaks. Naturally Zen goes still higher. Zen goes higher than Buddhism
and higher than Taoism because it contains all that was beautiful in
these two cultures, the ancientmost cultures, the longest seekers in the
world, who have staked all that they had for their seeking. Zen is the
purest flower.</p><p>In fact, Zen is not a flower. It is essence, it is fragrance. Even a
flower has something gross in it, something of the earth. So remember
it, when Zen is saying something, it is to be understood at the highest
level; otherwise there will</p><p>be no understanding about it. You will misunderstand it.</p><p>Seeking, you go astray; seeking, you go in dreams; seeking, you go
somewhere else; and truth is here. Seeking, you go then; and truth is
NOW. Seeking, you are, and seeking, you are too much. The more you seek,
the more you feel you are. The harder and more arduous the seeking
becomes, the stronger the ego becomes.</p><p>Seeking, you are, and seeking, you are too much; and there is no
space for the truth to be.</p><p>You fill the whole space of your being. Seeking, you are closed.</p><p>Have you not seen this happening in ordinary life too? A man is
suddenly told that his house is on fire. He rushes towards his house
from the office or from his shop: now he cannot see what is happening in
the market, on the road. Somebody says, "Hello"; he cannot hear.</p><p>Somebody comes and collides with him, but he cannot see who he is,
and he will not remember that somebody collided. His whole mind is
narrow now -- his house is on fire. His mind is concentrated.</p><p>Seeking means concentration, and truth is never achieved by
concentration. Truth is achieved by meditation. And the difference is
vital, and the difference is great. And you have to understand the
difference because ordinarily people who don't know anything about
meditation, they go on writing books in which they write that meditation
is concentration.</p><p>Meditation is not concentration! Meditation is just the opposite
state of concentration.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 147</p><p>Chapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is</p><p>When you concentrate your mind is narrowed down; when you meditate,
you mind is widened. When you concentrate, there is an object on which
you concentrate; when you meditate, there is no object.</p><p>People come to me and they ask, "On what to meditate?" Then they are
not asking about meditation. They are asking about concentration when
they come and they say to me, "I cannot concentrate. Osho, can you help
me?" Concentration means you want your mind to cling to something, you
want your mind to remain with something. Concentration is a sort of
attachment, so whenever your attachment is there you are
concentrated.</p><p>Your wife is dying, and if you are attached to her, you will forget
the whole world. Now nothing exists except your dying wife. You will be
sitting by her side and you will be concentrated; your mind will not go
here and there.</p><p>Or if you are driving a car and suddenly you see an imminent accident
is going to happen</p><p>-- some madman is coming, driving his car madly, and on the turn you
see now it is too late, it is going to happen -- suddenly you will be
concentrated, because you are too attached to life.</p><p>There will be no thoughts any more. Just a moment before, you were
thinking to see your girl friend, a moment before, you were thinking to
go to the movie tonight, or do this or that; suddenly all has
disappeared; there is no thought in the mind, no object. You are too
attached to life. Because of this attachment, all other objects have
disappeared. You are concentrated now only on your life; only one thing
has remained: your life.</p><p>Dostoevsky has written a memoir. He was young and he was a
revolutionary, and he was caught by the czar with twenty other people,
and they all were sentenced to death. The day came, ditches were dug,
and they were standing in front of the ditches and the man was getting
ready with the machine gun. Everything was ready.</p><p>Just close by on a church tower there is a clock, and each moment is
passing fast, and the life is disappearing. At exactly six o'clock, they
will be shot dead. It is ten minutes to six.</p><p>You can imagine how concentrated they must have become. Dostoevsky
writes, "Never again have I been so concentrated in my life. All else
disappeared. I could hear my heart throbbing, I could see my breathing
for the first time, I felt my body for the first time. I had never felt
my body, never heard my heartbeat, never seen my breath. Everything
became simply concentrated -- and we could</p><p>hear the clock moving.</p><p>Five minutes, four minutes, three minutes ... and the concentration
is becoming more and more and more. One minute ... and everything else
has disappeared.</p><p>When life is at stake, only life is in the mind.</p><p>And then comes a horseman, running, and the czar has pardoned them;
their death sentence has been converted into a life sentence.</p><p>One man, at exactly six o'clock, fell in the ditch, Died! without
being shot. Must have become so concentrated with the idea of death.
Died! Nobody could believe it. The officers ran. He was taken out of the
ditch, but he was dead. He believed it; he must have become hypnotized
with the idea of death. Death is coming, death is coming, fifteen
minutes, death is coming ... It was coming for two, three months; now it
was closer and closer and closer, and the mind became concentrated. The
man fell and died.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 148</p><p>Chapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is</p><p>Another man shouted, "I am dead!" He became mad. For his whole life
he remained shouting, "I am dead. I have died, don't you know?" He will
meet people and say, "Don't you know? I died on that day. Six o'clock
they killed me. I am a ghost! "</p><p>Dostoevsky himself could not believe it, because it was unimaginable,
that the czar was going to forgive them. But he writes in his memoirs
that "Never again was I concentrated; that was the peak of
concentration."</p><p>It is not meditation. If it was meditation, then Dostoevsky would
have become enlightened. That peak of concentration?</p><p>It happens to you. When you are studying for an examination, as the
examinations come closer, you become more and more concentrated. Just
the night before, your mind functions so concentratedly. Once the
examination is gone, the mind relaxes again.</p><p>Concentration is a mind thing; meditation is a no-mind thing.
Concentration means pouring your whole energy onto one object.
Meditation means not pouring your energy onto any object, but just
overflowing in all directions.</p><p>For example, if you are listening to me you can listen in two ways.
You can listen in the wrong way: the wrong way is the way of
concentration; you can just remain tense, strained. Or you can listen in
a relaxed, let-go way; you can remain relaxed. E you listen in a tense
way --</p><p>that is the meaning of the word "attention": "with tension,
concentration" -- then you will not listen to the birds singing in the
trees. Then you will listen only to me, and everything else will be
blocked out, bracketed out. That means only this small voice that is
here is in your concentration and the whole existence has been blocked
out.</p><p>Meditation is just the opposite: nothing is blocked out, you are open
in all directions. You are listening to me; you are listening to the
birds also. If the wind blows in the trees and the trees start a murmur,
you will listen to that too. And there will be no distraction,
remember.</p><p>You are so open, you listen to me and the bird and the wind, and they
all become one. And when you can listen in that way, you have listened
to God.</p><p>When you listen meditatively, you listen to God -- whatsoever you
listen to, it is God, it is God's message. He has reached you through
the tree, through the wind, through the bird, through me. He is coming
from everywhere, because he is everywhere. He surrounds you. So when you
are open to everything that is happening, to all that is happening, you
are herenow, you are in meditation. And this state is a state of
nonseeking.</p><p>Concentration is part of seeking; when you seek something you become
concentrated.</p><p>When you don't seek anything you become relaxed. When you seek
something and you are concentrated, you are going away from yourself.
Your object will be the goal, you forget yourself. Your arrow of
consciousness goes only to the object. When you are not going anywhere,
where will you be? When you are not going anywhere you will be where you
are, you will be whoever you are. You will be simply relaxing and
resting into yourself.</p><p>Ashtavakra says, "Rest in yourself, and you will attain all." Because
resting in yourself you will know who you are.</p><p>So it is not a question of seeking. Seeking, you are too much.
Seeking, you are so arrowed towards something that you don't see
anything else, your eyes don't allow all to enter into your being, and
then there is no space for the truth to be. Seeking, you become a cloud
and the sun goes behind. Hence, seeking, there is night and darkness and
death.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 149</p><p>Chapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is</p><p>When you are not seeking there is life, eternal life, and light and
God, or you can choose any name which you prefer. Buddha calls it
nirvana, nonseeking: you have arrived. In fact, you had never gone
anywhere else; you were only imagining.</p><p>"Tell us, Master," a monk asked Daito ... Daito was a great Zen
Master.</p><p>"Tell us, Master, when Shakyamuni Buddha saw the morning star, what
did he see?" ...</p><p>In Zen this is the legend, that Buddha was seeking and seeking for
six years, then he got tired and fed up with seeking, and one day he
dropped seeking too. As one day he had dropped his kingdom, his family,
his THIS world, one day he dropped his OTHER world too. As one day he
had become disinterested in the material, a day came when he became
disinterested in the spiritual too. And that was the night when he
rested in himself -- because there was nothing to seek. So he slept
under a tree, the Bodhi tree; that became the most famous tree in the
world. He rested under the Bodhi tree, slept well. There was no seeking,
so there was no dreaming either. The whole night was just a peaceful
rhythm, not even a thought, because the material world was gone, the
spiritual world was gone. It was an absolute rest into oneself.</p><p>By the morning, the Zen legend says, his eyes opened. Not that he
opened his</p><p>eyes, because there was nothing to do now: he will not even open his
eyes. The Zen legend says the eyes opened because the rest was complete.
See the difference. You can open your eyes; then there is strain. You
can close your eyes; then there is strain. When the eyes are closed by
themselves there is rest; when the eyes open by themselves, then there
is rest.</p><p>When a life is not a life of doing, but happening, then there is
rest.</p><p>The eyes opened and he saw the last morning star setting, it was just
disappearing, the last glimpse of it, in a moment it was gone, and he
became enlightened. The last trace disappeared with the disappearing
morning star, and he was utterly empty. He was utterly nobody. He became
a nothingness, a pure nothingness, a content-less consciousness.</p><p>What is the significance of this last star disappearing? When the
eyes opened and he saw the last star, there was a little concentration,
a slight concentration, must be the old habit, thousands of lives of old
habit. He must have become a little strained; a little concentration
must have arisen. Looking at the last star, he must have become focused,
his consciousness must have become narrow -- just out of old habit.
There was nothing to look at now. But then the star disappeared</p><p>-- it was the last star and the sun was going to rise soon, so the
star disappeared -</p><p>- the star disappeared, and the last object of concentration
disappeared.</p><p>Suddenly he was released from all concentration, suddenly there was
freedom, there was no content. The last star disappearing took away the
last trace of concentration. He was there</p><p>-- and he was not there. He was there for the first time
authentically -- and he was not there for the first time as an "I", as
an ego.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 150</p><p>Chapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is Some seeker asked Master
Daito ...</p><p>"Tell us, Master, when Shakyamuni Buddha saw the morning star, what
did he see?" ...</p><p>Why did he become enlightened by seeing the last star?</p><p>Many people have copied it -- people are foolish, people are monkeys.
Many Buddhists sit, they even go to Bodhgaya -- they come from China,
from Korea, from Japan, from Ceylon --</p><p>they go to Bodhgaya, they sit under the Bodhi tree, they try to rest
the whole night, and they watch, many times it must be, in the night
they must be looking: whether the last star is there or gone. And they
must be closing their eyes again -</p><p>- it is still night and there are so many stars -- and they must be
afraid and tense: will they be able to see the last star, or will they
miss? And they have to see the last star disappearing.</p><p>Once a Japanese man came and stayed with me. I said, "Why have you
come from Japan?"</p><p>He said, "To see the last star disappearing." I told him, "Can't you
see a last star disappearing in Japan? Don't the stars behave the same
way there? Don't they disappear in the morning?</p><p>For what have you come here?" And he said, "I have come to sit under
the Bodhi tree." But any tree will do. Buddha was not sitting under that
tree specifically. It was just a coincidence, it was accidental. He had
not searched for that tree. That tree was in no way special; it was as
ordinary a tree as any tree.</p><p>You can sit under any tree and under any sky and in any country, but
the question is not of country, not of the sky, not of the stars, not of
the tree. The question is, "Has your attachment to things -- and
attachment to other-worldly things -- disappeared, or is it still
there?"</p><p>Now, in fact, you have come to sit under the Bodhi tree because you
want to become enlightened. The desire. The seeking. You have come as a
seeker, and Buddha did attain because he was not a seeker that
night.</p><p>This is how things go on and man goes on imitating and becoming
foolish.</p><p>"Tell us, Master, when Shakyamuni Buddha saw the morning star, what
did he see?"</p><p>"Clean blank nothing," Daito replied at once. And then added, "But if
a person</p><p>has only so much as just one speck of dust in his eyes, he may look
at a blank and see all sorts of imaginary things."</p><p>Just a speck of dust will do, just a small speck of desire will do,
and then you will start seeing imaginary things. If you really want to
see that which is, then the eyes have to be utterly clean, blank. With
those blank eyes you are a Buddha</p><p>-- with those empty eyes.</p><p>Seeking, one never finds. Let it be a fundamental remembrance. So
Pablo Picasso is true, but only half true.</p><p>And half-truths are really dangerous. They can pretend, they can
masquerade as truths, as whole truths. That's what happens. Whenever a
man like Buddha moves, walks on the earth, that's what happens -- his
truths become half-truths in our minds. A half-truth is a reflection of
truth. A half-truth is a shadow of truth. In our monkey minds, in our
imitative minds, we start Osho - The First Principle</p><p>151</p><p>Chapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is</p><p>imitating half-truths. And there is something which has to be
understood. A half- truth deceives better.</p><p>But Pablo Picasso could not have done better, because art itself
cannot go beyond the half-truth. That's the difference between art and
religion. Art is the world of the shadows, the world of the reflections,
the world of imagination, the world of dreams, the world of desires, the
world of projections. Art cannot give you the whole truth, but the best
art is always giving you half of it -- that too the best art. I am not
talking about the third-rate art. A third-rate art is simply a lie, a
fantasy, a fiction. But Pablo Picasso is one of the greatest artists the
world has ever produced. The best art always give you half; more is not
possible through art.</p><p>The artist has glimpses of truth, reflected in the world of his
dreams, in the world of his imagination. The artist is a pool of
imagination, a lake of imagination. In that lake is reflected the full
moon. And sometimes the moon in the lake looks far more beautiful than
the real moon. On the glossy, silent surface of the lake, on the placid,
silent surface of the lake, the moon looks even more innocent. But that
is not a real moon -- although the reflection belongs to the real.</p><p>That is the difference between the mystic and the artist. The best
artist comes closer to the mystic than anybody else, but the artist is
not a mystic. He is a shadow, a shadow mystic.</p><p>William Blake or Pablo Picasso or Emerson or Rabindranath, they give
beautiful reflections of the truth. And even the reflection is so
enchanting, what to say about the original?</p><p>But if you jump into the lake to find the moon, even the reflection
will disappear. You are not supposed to jump into the lake. And where
the reflection is, you are not to go in that direction. You have to move
exactly in the opposite direction, then you will find the real.</p><p>The artist has some quality of the mystic; he is on the way to
becoming a mystic in some life. The mystic has all the qualities of the
artist, plus.</p><p>Sometimes mystics have been artists, particularly Zen mystics. They
have painted. They have written poems, haiku. They have carved wood,
they have sculpted. They were great artists. In fact, all Zen Masters
have been creative people.</p><p>That should also be remembered. When you have attained to a state of
consciousness, your consciousness has to create something, something
visible. You have to materialize something of your consciousness into
the world so that this world also becomes beautiful. And people who
cannot understand religion at least can understand art. You may not be
able to understand the meaning of the Upanishads, but the very poetry of
it appeals, and if the poetry appeals, then the truth is making a way
towards your heart. You may not be able to meditate, but if somebody is
dancing with deep meditation, that dance may appeal, and through the
dance, lingering by the side, something of the meditation will enter
into your being.</p><p>Gurdjieff had prepared a group of dancers, and he took the dancers to
many great cities of the world. It was a rare opportunity made
available. When in New York those meditators danced, people were
suddenly amazed, they could not believe what was happening. The dancers
created such meditative energy, such a great wave of energy, that those
who had come just to see the dance suddenly forgot the dance completely.
Something else was there by the side, a door opened through it.</p><p>And Gurdjieff used to do the "stop" exercise. The dancers are
dancing, a group of twenty, thirty dancers, and they are going wild in
their dance, and suddenly he will shout by the side, Osho - The First
Principle</p><p>152</p><p>Chapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is</p><p>"Stop!" And they will all become just marble statues, as they were.
If the hand was raised, it will remain raised. If one leg was up, it
will remain up.</p><p>At one moment when he said, "Stop!" they were in such a position that
they all fell -- fell from the stage, in front of the audience in the
hall. But not a single person moved; they fell as if dead. And one man
who was watching, something inside him also fell. The very shocking
incident, these people fallen as if dead, and something changed in his
mind. He became one of the great followers of Gurdjieff and attained to
greater heights of consciousness.</p><p>Looking at a Zen painting you will be surprised because the painting
brings to you something of the man who has painted it. If you look at
modern painting, that too brings something to you. If you look at a
modern painting long enough, you will start feeling a little crazy. If
you put too many modern paintings in your bedroom, beware, you will have
nightmares. Those paintings will start entering into your dreams. You
cannot look at a modern painting for long; you have to move. You start
feeling weird, something is wrong, something is bizarre.</p><p>The modern painter is insane. He is painting out of his insanity. If
you look at a Zen painting, a silence oozes out of it, suddenly
something beautiful surrounds you. You are transported to another
consciousness. The painting carries something of the touch of the
Master. The painting has been done in deep meditation; the painting has
been done by one who has arrived.</p><p>Gurdjieff used to call such art "objective art". When somebody who
has attained to consciousness does something, that something becomes
objective art. Looking at that thing, you will have some glimpse of the
Master. The Master may have been dead for three thousand years, that
doesn't matter. The painting, the statue, the carving will represent
him, and through it you can again become connected to him. If you know
how to meditate with a painting, it will be easier.</p><p>Within these twenty years a rare thing has come to light because of
too much use</p><p>of drugs.</p><p>The underground world of drugs has stumbled upon a very significant
fact; they call it</p><p>"contact high". It is exactly the meaning of SATSANG. Let me explain
it to you.</p><p>A "contact high" is a state. Somebody has taken LSD and is turned on,
and you love the man, you really love the man, or the woman, you really
relate to him -- the man or the woman is somebody who turns you on by
her presence or his presence. The person has taken LSD.</p><p>You simply sit by the side, and you love the person, and the person's
presence turns you on, and by and by you will start feeling that the LSD
is affecting you too, that somehow his consciousness is infiltrating
your consciousness, that your space is being overpowered. And you will
start feeling high. This is contact high.</p><p>This is the meaning of SATSANG too, on a different plane. If somebody
has attained, just being with him in deep love. in deep gratitude, in
deep relatedness, and you will start feeling that something, through
him, reaches your heart, stirs your being, and you are put on a totally
different plane, where you cannot go by yourself. You are transported,
carried to it. Yes, it too is a contact high.</p><p>That's why in the East we have praised SATSANG so much, to be in the
presence of a Master, to attain contact high. And once you have started
attaining through somebody, by and by you can find your own way.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 153</p><p>Chapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is</p><p>This contact high is possible even after thousands of years, through
objective art. Read some haiku of Basho, small haiku. Read one haiku,
repeat it, sing it, chew it, swallow it deeply, and then sit silently,
waiting for the meaning to be revealed. Don't think about it; thinking,
you will go astray. Don't analyze it; analyzing, you will go far away.
Meditate, just be with it, let it be with you, and suddenly you will
find something is changing in your consciousness. You are moving
upwards, or you are moving deeper.</p><p>The very small haiku can turn you on. It can almost become an LSD
trip because the haiku carries Basho's consciousness, condensed. It is
no ordinary poetry. It is not written by a poet, not by an artist. It is
done by a Master.</p><p>And the Master has put it almost like a mantra. If you simply allow
it to spread its meaning on your being, its fragrance on your being, you
will be in the state of contact high.</p><p>That's why I say Picasso's statement is a half-truth. "I do not seek"
is the half- truth, and "I find" is the half-untruth, because it is
never the "I" that finds it. "I" is the barrier, the cloud, the
hindrance, the obstacle. Truth is found, but not by "I". Truth is found
only when there is no</p><p>"I", when there is nobody to find it. Truth is found only when there
is nobody to seek it and nobody to find it.</p><p>Now, the "I" has seven layers, those seven times when Bodhidharma
fell and again rose.</p><p>You will also fall seven times before you can attain to
enlightenment. The first layer consists of the past: "I" is memory. Go
with me into it as deeply as possible because this will lead you to the
first principle. The first principle cannot be said, but can be showed,
how you can attain it.</p><p>The first layer of "I" consists of memory, the past. If you want to
get rid of the "I" you will have to get rid of the past. Many people
come to me and they say, "We would like to drop this ego." But they
think that the ego is a noncomplex thing, a simple thing. It is not. It
is very complex, the most complex. In fact, the one who wants to drop it
may be the ego itself. That is so subtle, it is so tricky. Layer upon
layer. The first layer is the memory.</p><p>If you really want to drop the ego -- and that is the only way to
find the truth; all religion consists only of dropping these seven
layers -- don't live in the memory. By and by, the moment you catch hold
of yourself, that you are moving in the memory, immediately slip out of
it. Immediately. Don't waste a single moment. I am not saying repent
about it, I am not saying feel guilty about it, no, because that too
will be the past. I am simply saying the moment you find you were moving
into a dream about the past, a nostalgia, the moment you find it so,
just slip out of it. There is no need to fight with it. If you fight,
you will be defeated.</p><p>There is no need to feel angry about it. If you feel angry you will
be defeated. You need not value it in any way, good or bad. You simply
do one thing: the moment you find out, slip out of it.</p><p>And the one who finds it red-handed is your awareness. Eckhart says
the one who finds is God, God within you.</p><p>Just try. Whenever you find your memory is hovering around you too
much, the one who finds this sudden recognition that "Yes, I am again in
the memory," that one, that awareness, is God within you. Slip out of
the memory.</p><p>And I say slip out of it because there is no need to fight. Fighting,
you will cling to it.</p><p>Fighting, you will have to be there. If you have to fight with
somebody you have to be there.</p><p>Don't fight.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 154</p><p>Chapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is</p><p>And you are capable of slipping out, just as a snake slips out of the
old skin. Go on slipping out of the memory. Memory is an old skin. In
fact, you have already slipped out of it; it is just in the mind, it is
nowhere else.</p><p>The second layer consists of unawareness. We live almost in a drunken
state. We live with the minimum of consciousness. You go on doing
things, you go on moving, this and that, but you are not conscious. Have
you ever had any moments of consciousness so that you can see, you can
compare?</p><p>For example ... Just now! See what is there. Gather yourself
together. Just be herenow and see what is there, and you will find your
consciousness is more, you have come out of a fog.</p><p>Soon you will again disappear into the fog. This fog surrounds you.
Sometimes you come out of it. Sometimes something penetrates your fog,
brings you out.</p><p>But ordinarily, life is so monotonous, there is no surprise, nothing
brings you out.</p><p>Whenever you are a little more aware, many things happen. If you
watch you will understand. A beautiful woman passes by; suddenly you
become more aware. A bird on the wing, you were watching an empty sky
and a bird passes by</p><p>...</p><p>Ramkrishna attained to his first SAMADHI, to his first satori, by
seeing a row of cranes against the black clouds. He was very young, must
have been thirteen. He was sitting by the lake of his town, it was
cloudy, dark clouds were gathering, the beginning of the rain, and
suddenly a row, many white cranes against the black clouds. Almost like
lighting they were there and they were gone, and he attained to his
first SAMADHI. For days he was drunk with the unknown, he danced, sang.
His town's people, his family thought he had gone mad. But he was so
happy.</p><p>That sudden experience. Something penetrated like a sword. Something
was cut.</p><p>Sometimes it happens to you too. You don't take account of these
moments, because you are afraid. You try to forget them. And they are so
extraordinary and they are so exceptional and so rare that even to talk
about them, nobody will believe it. So you don't take account of them;
you think, "Must be a fantasy, an imagination." But one day in the
morning suddenly the world is beautiful -- for no reason at all. The
reason IS there: the reason is you are more aware. Maybe you rested well
in the night, it was a good sleep, the dreams were not too many, your
stomach was not too full of food or hungry. Things somehow went well,
and in the morning you felt on the top of the world. It is nothing but
awareness.</p><p>With a friend you have not seen for many years, suddenly you become
more aware.</p><p>Anything that makes you more aware, watch it, take account of it,
remember it, so that you can go more and more into it. Don't put it
aside. Don't neglect it. It has to be fed and watered, taken care
of.</p><p>The third layer of "I" is ambition, comparison with the others, where
I am, higher or lower, inferior or superior, ahead or lagging behind --
who I am. Watch it: never compare. You are you. And there is nobody like
you, so comparison is not possible. And everybody is so unique and so
different, how can you</p><p>compare? Drop comparison. Whether you find yourself caught in
comparison, immediately drop it, then and there. It is not good to carry
these things in the mind longer; otherwise they leave traces, they make
grooves in the mind. Never compare.</p><p>Somebody is more intelligent, somebody is more beautiful, somebody is
more healthy ... Don't compare. You are you.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 155</p><p>Chapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is</p><p>And this is the way God wanted you to be. Feel fulfilled the way you
are and accept yourself. Don't condemn yourself.</p><p>The fourth layer of "I" consists of future, always thinking ahead,
what to do tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. Or people are so mad,
they are thinking of what to do in the next life: where to go, to hell
or heaven?</p><p>People come to me and they ask, "Osho, what do you say about life
after death?" I say,</p><p>"You are not alive even now, and you are talking about life after
death? I don't even see life before death."</p><p>Man is not! Man only thinks that he is. Man has not happened yet.
Rarely it happens. Once in a while, in a Buddha or a Bodhidharma a man
is there; otherwise you are just a belief. And you are thinking about
life after death? Think of life after birth! Think of life before
death.</p><p>Think of life now. Don't go into the future too much.</p><p>I am not saying that if you want to go to Bombay don't book a ticket
-- I am not saying that. Otherwise there are fools of that type too. One
day I talked in the morning, "Don't think of the future," and by the
evening I received a letter. One friend threw his passport into the
river. "Why bother? 'Don't think of the future,' Osho has said." I am
not saying that. There is a practical world, but that is not a problem
at all. To carry a passport is not a problem.</p><p>To carry fantasies about the future is a problem. A passport is not
such a burden. To think about tomorrow and to go and book a ticket is
not a problem. These are factual things, ordinary, practical things. But
to think that tomorrow you will be happy, not today, that tomorrow you
will love, not today, that tomorrow you will sing, not today, is
dangerous --</p><p>because tomorrow never comes. Again when it comes, it will be today,
and your old habit will say, "Tomorrow I will be happy." Tomorrow again
and again, you will be happy, and you will never be happy.</p><p>What I am saying is psychological future has to be dropped. The
ordinary future is okay, it is not a problem at all.</p><p>The fifth layer consists of conditionings. You have been conditioned
-- Hindu, Mohammedan, Jaina, Buddhist, English, German, Indian -- these
layers are there. Start dropping them.</p><p>Again, please, don't throw your passport!</p><p>These ideas from the mind -- that I am a German or a Japanese or a
Chinese -- are just foolish. You were born just as pure consciousness
and you will die as pure consciousness, and all these are just dresses,
formalities, forms, what Hindus call NAM-RUP, name and form.</p><p>But you are not confined to them, you are not contained in them; you
are beyond them.</p><p>The sixth layer consists of arrogance, of nonhumbleness. One has to
learn humbleness because that is reality. We are interdependent, so how
can we be arrogant? You cannot live without the air, you cannot live
without fire, you cannot live without the sun, you cannot live without
the trees, you cannot live without the woman, woman without the man --
you cannot live at all independently. So all arrogance is just
ignorance. We are interdependent, we interpenetrate each other, and
everything is required.</p><p>If the sun sets tonight and never rises again we will die. Within ten
minutes we will die. If all the forests disappear and the trees
disappear we will die, we will not be able to live. We breathe through
the trees, they are continuously working for us and we are working for
them.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 156</p><p>Chapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is</p><p>Don't think that they are slaves and we are masters. Nobody is a
slave here and nobody is a master; everybody is a master here and
everybody is a slave here. This is humility. They go on releasing oxygen
for you; they serve you. And you go on releasing carbon dioxide for
them, they live on carbon dioxide; so you serve them. They serve you,
you serve them.</p><p>We are servants of each other or masters of each other, but we are
all in the same boat. The animals, the trees, the birds, the rocks, we
are all in the same boat. We exist in a togetherness; that's the meaning
of humbleness.</p><p>I am not saying become humble and start being arrogant about your
humbleness and start saying that "I am the most humble man in the
world." That will be arrogance again.</p><p>Humbleness is an understanding, not a cultivation.</p><p>And the last layer of "I" consists of imitations. We learn to imitate
-- that's what I mean when I say we are monkeys. Somebody is doing
something: we start doing that. Somebody is making something: we start
making that. We learn through imitation. Good for the children because
otherwise children will never learn, but when will you become mature,
when will you start not imitating, and being true to yourself?</p><p>If these seven layers are dropped, you will simply become aware of
who you are. You are God, as everybody else is God.</p><p>These seven layers are the "bottle".</p><p>Now let me tell you this beautiful anecdote. It is one of the most
beautiful anecdotes in the Zen literature, and Zen has many beautiful
anecdotes. This is one of the topmost. Listen to it.</p><p>THE OFFICIAL, RIKO, ONCE ASKED NANSEN ...</p><p>Nansen was a great Master. You must have heard another story, I must
have told you sometime. A great professor comes to see Nansen. The
professor was the head of the department of philosophy in a university.
He comes, and immediately he asks, "Do you believe in God? Is there any
life after death? Has man a soul?"</p><p>Nansen says, "Wait. Let me prepare tea for you. You are tired and you
are perspiring. And there is no hurry; these problems can wait a little.
Let me prepare tea for you." And he prepares the tea. This is the
humbleness of a Zen Master.</p><p>He brings tea. He goes on pouring the tea in the cup. The cup is full
and the tea starts overflowing into the saucer, and then the saucer is
full, and the professor shouts, "What are you doing? Are you mad? Now
there is not any space, not even for a single drop, and you go on
pouring and you go on pouring. It will start dropping on your
floor!"</p><p>And Nansen laughs and he says, "So you understand. Now do you have
any questions, still?"</p><p>The professor says, "Why, what do you mean? How does this explain my
questions?"</p><p>And Nansen says, "Have you any space in your head? I can give you the
answer, but there is no space. I don't see any space in your head. And
you are alert, very alert; you can see that when the cup is full, no
more tea should be poured in. Go, please, and clean your skull. Empty
your skull and come back! Because these questions are such that they can
only be answered to an empty skull."</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 157</p><p>Chapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is Nansen is a rare man.</p><p>THE OFFICIAL, RIKO, ONCE ASKED NANSEN TO EXPLAIN TO HIM THE OLD</p><p>PROBLEM OF THE GOOSE IN THE BOTTLE.</p><p>The problem is very ancient. It is a koan; it is given to a disciple,
that he has to meditate on it. It is absurd; you cannot "solve" it. A
koan is something which cannot be solved.</p><p>Remember, it is not a puzzle. A puzzle has a clue; a koan has no
clue. A koan is a puzzle without any clue. Not that more intelligence
will solve it. No, no intelligence will ever solve it. Even if it is
given to God, it will not be solved. It is made in such a way that it
cannot be solved. This is a koan.</p><p>"IF A MAN PUTS A GOSLING INTO A BOTTLE," SAID RIKO, "AND FEEDS
HIM</p><p>UNTIL HE IS FULL GROWN, HOW CAN THE MAN GET THE GOOSE OUT WITHOUT</p><p>KILLING IT OR BREAKING THE BOTTLE?"</p><p>Don't break the bottle -- and the goose has to be taken out -- and
don't kill the goose. Now, these are the two conditions to be fulfilled.
The koan becomes impossible. The bottle has a small neck; the goose
cannot come out from it. Either you have to break the bottle or you have
to kill the goose. You can kill the goose, and piece by piece you can
take the goose out, or you can break the bottle, and the goose can come
out alive, whole. But the condition is the bottle has not to be broken
and the goose has not to be killed. The goose has to come out whole and
the bottle has to remain whole. Nothing has to be destroyed; no
destruction allowed.</p><p>Now, how are you going to solve it? But meditating on it, meditating
on it ... one day it happens that you see the point. Not that you solve
the problem, suddenly the problem is no more there.</p><p>NANSEN GAVE A GREAT CLAP WITH HIS HANDS AND SHOUTED, "RIKO!"</p><p>"YES, MASTER," SAID THE OFFICIAL WITH A START. "SEE," SAID NANSEN,
"THE GOOSE IS OUT!"</p><p>Now, it is tremendously beautiful. What he is saying is that the
goose has never been in, the goose has always been out. What is he
saying, the moment he said, "Riko!"? What happened? Those seven layers
of ego disappeared and Riko became aware. The shout was so sudden, the
sound was so unexpected. He was expecting a philosophical answer.</p><p>That's why sometimes the Zen Master will hit you on your head or
throw you out of the window or jump upon you or threaten you that he
will kill you: he will do something so that those seven layers of ego
are immediately transcended and your awareness, which is the center of
all, is alert. You are made alert.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 158</p><p>Chapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is</p><p>Now, shouting "Riko!" so suddenly, for no reason at all -- and he has
brought a small puzzle to be solved and this Master suddenly shouts
"Riko!" -- he cannot see the connection.</p><p>And that is the whole clue to it. He cannot see the connection, the
shout startles him, and he says, "Yes, Master."</p><p>"See," said Nansen, "the goose is out!" Those seven layers of the
bottle are crossed.</p><p>"Yes, Master" -- in that moment Riko was pure consciousness, without
any layer. In that moment, Riko was not the body. In that moment, Riko
was not the mind. In that moment, Riko was just awareness. In that
moment, Riko was not the memory of the past. In that moment, Riko was
not the future, the desire. In that moment, he was not in any comparison
with anybody. In that moment, he was not a Buddhist or a Mohammedan or a
Hindu. In that moment, he was not a Japanese or an Indian.</p><p>In that moment, when the Master shouted "Riko!" he was simply
awareness, without any content, without any conditioning. In that
moment, he was not young, old. In that moment, he was not beautiful,
ugly. In that moment, he was not stupid, intelligent. All layers
disappeared.</p><p>In that moment, he was just a flame of awareness.</p><p>That is the meaning when the Master says, "See, the goose is out --
and I have not broken the bottle, I have not even touched the bottle."
The bottle means the ego, those seven layers. "I have not broken the
bottle, it is there, and I have not killed the goose. And the goose is
out."</p><p>Now, there are three types of religions in the world. One which will
destroy the bottle.</p><p>Then you become very vulnerable, then you become very insecure, then
great trembling arises in you, and then there is every possibility you
may go mad. That sort of thing happens many times in India. There are
methods which can destroy the bottle, easier methods. They destroy the
bottle, and the goose is out; but then the goose has no house to abide
in, no shelter; then there is every possibility the man may go mad. And
many people in India, seeking, searching, working towards the unknown
become mad. When the unknown comes into them, they have no
protection.</p><p>Remember, you need protection even against God because God can be too
much too suddenly. Those protections have not to be destroyed;
practically, they have to remain there.</p><p>Just think of a person who has no ego. Now, the house is on fire: he
will not run out. For what? "I am not. The fire cannot burn me, because
I am not." Just think of a man who has no ego, and he is standing in the
middle of the road, and there comes a bus and the driver honks and
honks, and he does not bother. He is the immortal soul, he is not the
ego. This state can be dangerous. It happens if you destroy the
bottle.</p><p>Zen says don't destroy the bottle. Use it when it is needed. Whenever
you feel to have protection, the goose simply goes inside the bottle.
Sometimes one needs rest, and sometimes the bottle is also useful. It
can be put to a thousand and one uses. The ego can be used if you know
that you are not the ego. Then the ego cannot use you, you can use
it.</p><p>And there are methods which will save the bottle and kill the goose
-- self- destructive methods are there -- so one becomes more and more
unaware. That is what I mean when I say kill the goose: one becomes more
and more unaware. Drugs can do that. Drugs have been used in India for
thousands of years. They</p><p>can kill the goose. The bottle remains protected, but the goose is
killed. If you take some foreign chemicals inside your being and your
nature is Osho - The First Principle</p><p>159</p><p>Chapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is</p><p>not ready to absorb them, by and by you will kill the goose, your
consciousness will be gone, you may fall in a coma.</p><p>The first possibility, if the bottle is broken and thrown; you may go
mad. The second possibility, if the goose is killed, or almost killed:
you will become so unconscious that you will become a zombie. You can
find zombies. In many monasteries there are zombies, whose goose is
killed, or at least drugged. And there are mad people, maniacs.</p><p>Zen says avoid both. The bottle has to remain and the goose has to
come out. This is a great synthesis.</p><p>"YES, MASTER," SAID THE OFFICIAL WITH A START. "SEE," SAID NANSEN,
"THE GOOSE IS OUT!"</p><p>It must have been a moment of great discovery to Riko. He must have
seen it, "Yes, it is out." He is fully aware. The trick worked, the
device worked, the shouting and clapping worked. In fact, Riko must have
been almost on the verge; otherwise shouting would not do.</p><p>You can go on shouting. Clapping won't do. But the man must have been
just on the verge of it. Just a small push, and he has jumped the
barrier.</p><p>Meditate over it. This is the way to attain the first principle: to
know that the goose can be out without destroying the bottle, that you
can be God without destroying your humanity, that you can be God without
destroying your ordinariness.</p><p>A disciple of His Divine Grace Prabhupad came to see me. Prabhupad is
the founder of the Krishna Consciousness movement. Naturally, to be
respectful to me, he also called me His Divine Grace. I said, "Don't
call me that; just call me</p><p>'his Divine Ordinariness'."</p><p>The ordinary is the extraordinary. The ordinary has not to be
destroyed. Once the ordinary is in the service of the extraordinary it
is beautiful, it is tremendously beautiful.</p><p>Let me repeat: the trivial is the profound, samsara is nirvana.
Whatsoever you are, there is nothing wrong with it. Just something is
missing. Nothing wrong with it! Something is simply missing. Just that
missing link has to be provided, that plus, and everything that you have
becomes divine.</p><p>Love has not to be destroyed; only awareness has to be added to it.
Relationship has not to be destroyed; only meditation has to be added to
it. You need not go from the marketplace, you need not go to any cave
and in the Himalayas; only God has to be called there in the
marketplace.</p><p>The bottle is beautiful, nothing is wrong in it. You just have to
learn that you can come out of it whenever you want and you can go into
it whenever you want, that it is your pleasure. It is almost like the
house. When you feel too cool or cold in the house, freezing cold, you
get out under the sky, under the sun, to warm yourself. Then it becomes
too warm and you start perspiring; you go into the house. You are free.
The same door takes you out, the same door takes you in, and the house
is not the enemy.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 160</p><p>Chapter 9 - You: the Greatest Lie There Is</p><p>But if you cannot get out of the house, then something is wrong.
There is no need to leave the house, there is no need to drop being a
householder. There is only one thing needed: in the house become a
sannyasin, in the world remain in such a way that the world is not in
you.</p><p>See, the goose is out. In fact, the goose has always been out, just a
recognition is needed.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle</p><p>161</p><p>Chapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray 10</p><p>All Going Is Going Astray</p><p>20 April 1977 am in Buddha Hall Question</p><p>THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN I FEEL NO HOPE, WITHOUT FEELING</p><p>DESPERATE, WHEN THERE IS RECOGNITION THAT THE "I" HAS FOUGHT</p><p>ENOUGH AND CANNOT HELP ANYMORE. YET UNDER THESE MOMENTARY</p><p>COVERS LINGERS THE ONE AND ONLY LONGING: TO BECOME MY REAL</p><p>NATURE, TO EXPERIENCE TRUTH AND TO LIVE IT IN THE WORLD. MY MIND</p><p>PLEASES ITSELF TO CALL THIS LONGING AN AUTHENTIC, GENUINE THIRST.</p><p>HOWEVER, THE SUSPICION IS THERE THAT IT IS JUST A WAY TO HIDE MY</p><p>PLAIN GREED.</p><p>The question is from Gunakar. Yes, Gunakar, it is a way to hide the
greed. And not only that, it is a way to avoid the real. It is not a
thirst for the real; it is a way to escape from the real. All greed, all
desire, is an escape from the real. The desire is for that which is not.
That which is already there; you need not be greedy about it, you need
not desire it. Whether you desire or not does not make any difference.
It is there. By desiring, you will miss, because you will create a</p><p>cloud around yourself.</p><p>This is how the mind goes on playing games. It can play the game in
the name of reality too, in the name of God, in the name of
enlightenment, nirvana.</p><p>One thing has to be remembered always, that you are not to become
real, you are real. That which you are is the reality. Gunakar has said:
Only one longing lingers, to become my real nature. But then who are
you? You are your real nature. What else can you be? How else can you
be? There is no way to go away from your reality. There is no way to go
against it. There is no way to be anything else other than it.</p><p>But you can forget about it. You can start looking in some other
direction. All that is possible is to be forgetful. You cannot lose
contact with reality; you can only forget it. You can start looking in
some other direction. You can put it at the back. You can avoid your
eyes.</p><p>You can pretend that you are not the real.</p><p>The first thing: you are the real. Whatsoever you are is your
reality. It has not to be attained; it is already there. It has
happened. Nirvana is not somewhere in the future. Either it is now or
never. To seek it is to miss it. If you want to find it, don't seek it.
Just be herenow.</p><p>And when I say just be herenow, don't make a desire out of it. Don't
start asking how to be here and now. Don't start planning that "I have
to work hard to be here and now." You have moved away; that "how" takes
you away.</p><p>You are your real nature. This is the great declaration of Zen. Other
religions say you have to find God. Zen says you are. Other religions
say long is the journey. Zen says there is no question of any journey
whatsoever. You are already there! Maybe fast asleep, snoring, but you
are there. The goal is where you are. You are the goal, you are the
target.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 162</p><p>Chapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray</p><p>You want "to experience truth and to live it in the world". That's
what you are already doing. Drinking tea you are living the truth.
Talking to a friend you are living the truth. Going for a morning walk
you are living the truth. Even being angry you are living the truth. How
can it be otherwise?</p><p>The ordinary is the extraordinary, and the trivial is the profound.
The samsara is nirvana.</p><p>It is just a question of remembering.</p><p>"... to become my real nature, to experience truth and to live it in
the world". That's what you are doing, Gunakar. Just the mind goes on
playing a game. The mind says things can be better. The mind says life
can be improved upon. The mind says there must be something more, you
must be missing something -- seek, search, do something. This is greed,
and the greed is so subtle that it can hide in millions of ways. It can
even start trying not to be greedy.</p><p>Now, listening to me, your mind will say, "Right. Now I am not to be
greedy at all because it is greed that is destroying my life. So I have
to get rid of greed." Again the greed has come, from the back door.</p><p>"It was deep in the woods back yonder," began old Herman, the guide.
"I was plodding along minding my own business when suddenly a huge bear
sneaked up behind me. He pinned my arms to my sides and started to
squeeze the breath out of me. My gun fell out of my hands.</p><p>First thing you know, the bear had stooped down, picked up the gun,
and was pressing it against my back."</p><p>"What did you do?" gasped the tenderfoot.</p><p>Old Herman sighed. "What could I do? I married his daughter." But the
bear or the daughter, it makes no difference. It is the same.</p><p>Just be aware of the ways of the greed. Don't try to get rid of it.
Don't try to do anything.</p><p>Just be aware of how greed takes a thousand and one forms. Watch it.
There is no hurry.</p><p>And you are not losing anything. You are living the truth. You cannot
lose, in the very nature of things. We are all winners. Here nobody can
be a loser. God has managed the world in such a way. That's why mystics
say this i3 the most perfect world. God has managed it in such a way
that everybody is a winner, nobody is a loser. Everybody is a victor,
nobody is ever defeated. Even in your defeat there is victory, and even
when you think you are lost you are not lost. It is all dream. The day
you become awake you will find you have never been outside your home,
you have always been there.</p><p>The only thing is to become more and more alert. Just watch. You see
greed arising in one way, watch it. Don't try to stop it; otherwise it
will arise in another way. It may choose just the opposite so it can
deceive you. Don't do anything to it; otherwise it will find another
way. No need to fight with it. Just watch it, let it be there. Watch it.
See it naked, through and through.</p><p>Awareness functions like an X-ray. It sees things through and
through, and in that very seeing there is freedom. If you have seen the
greed totally, in that very seeing greed disappears. Not that you make
it disappear. It disappears. In that vision it is not found. In that
light that darkness is no more there. Suddenly you are free of
greed.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 163</p><p>Chapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray</p><p>And when you are free of greed you know you have never left the home,
you have always been there. You have never left God. Adam has never been
expelled from the garden of Eden.</p><p>He still lives there; he just dreams that he has been expelled. This
is the Zen interpretation of the biblical story.</p><p>I must have given you a thousand interpretations about the story. The
story is so beautiful.</p><p>Zen says Adam is still living in the garden of Eden. The snake has
not tricked him into sin.</p><p>The snake has only tricked him into a dream. And God has not expelled
him. How can God expel you? And to where can he expel you? It is all his
garden. Where will you be? Wherever you will be it will be his garden,
so to where can he expel you? And how can God expel?</p><p>Expelling Adam, God will be expelling himself, a part of himself. He
will fall into parts. No, it is not possible.</p><p>Then what has happened? Adam has fallen asleep. Eating the fruit of
the tree of knowledge, Adam has fallen asleep and is dreaming that God
is very angry. It is his own dream. It is his own idea. It is his own
guilt. It is his own mind, that "I have broken the rule,"</p><p>that "I had promised, and I have broken my promise." Now he is
trembling and feeling guilty, and in the sleep the guilt is creating a
dream that God is very angry. He is projecting his guilt on God. His
guilt is becoming God's anger, in his mind. Naturally God must be very
angry, and he is expelling him, and he has expelled him. The gates are
closed, and Adam is thrown into the world.</p><p>But it is just a dream. The moment Adam becomes awake, he will laugh.
He will have an uproarious laugh. He will roll down on the ground. His
belly will start bursting with the laughter because he will see the
whole absurdity of it: he had never been out.</p><p>Have you not dreamed dreams like this? In a dream you are being
killed, and in that moment when you are being murdered, can you doubt
it? It is so real. You shriek, you scream, and because of the shriek and
the scream you become alert, you become aware. The dream is broken. Even
after the dream your heart is beating louder, your breath is not in
rhythm, your hands are shaking. You know now it was a dream, a
nightmare, you are sitting in your bed and there is nobody, just your
poor wife sleeping by your side -- no murderer -- the doors are closed,
everything is silent, there has been nobody in the room, nobody was
murdering you; but still you are trembling. The fear has been so deeply
there, the idea of murder has penetrated so deeply in you, that even
when you are awake, a little smoke of it continues to be there. But now
you know you have never been out of the room and nobody is trying to
murder you, there is nobody.</p><p>This is what I say to you. You are still in the garden of Eden. God
has not expelled you.</p><p>You have fallen asleep.</p><p>And the work of the Master is to bring you back. Back, not from
anywhere, but only from sleep. Back to awareness.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 164</p><p>Chapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray Question</p><p>WHY DO YOU TALK ONLY TO YOUR DISCIPLES? WHY NOT TO THE MASSES?</p><p>There is a beautiful Zen saying. Let that be the answer.</p><p>"I sing my songs to him who understands them. I drink my wine with
the friend who knows me well."</p><p>Question</p><p>IT ALL SOUNDS SO GREAT, AS PERFECT AS CAN BE ARTICULATED. BUT</p><p>WHAT THE HELL DO YOU DO IN THE MEANTIME?</p><p>You have missed. You have not understood what has been said to you.
You have not heard. Again the greed has become a barrier. Listening to
me you are listening through the greed.</p><p>When you listen to me, if I am talking about enlightenment and the
joy of it, you become greedy. You start thinking, "When am I going to
become enlightened?" So you say it is great</p><p>-- it all sounds great, "as perfect as can be articulated". Now, this
greed creates a problem.</p><p>You put whatsoever I am saying as a goal. Of course, the goal is far
away. There is a distance between you and the goal, and the distance has
to be traveled, so the</p><p>second question arises:</p><p>"What the hell do you do in the meantime?"</p><p>But there is no meantime. I am not talking about the goal; I am
talking about the way. And I am not saying anything about the future or
afterlife; I am saying something about THIS</p><p>moment, this very moment! This is it! You think in terms of tomorrow.
I am talking about today.</p><p>Jesus says to his disciples, "Look in the field. Look at the
beautiful lilies. They don't think of the morrow, they toil not, they
labor not. Look at these beautiful flowers. They are just herenow. Even
Solomon attired in all his costly clothes was not so beautiful. Look at
these lilies in the field."</p><p>I am talking about THIS moment. What do you mean by "meantime"? There
is no meantime. This is it! These birds, this cuckoo, these trees, you
and me: this moment. This is the moment of nirvana.</p><p>But you start thinking in terms of desire. You say, "It sounds
great." In fact, a thing that could have released your celebration
becomes a desire, and through desire you start feeling sad because the
goal is far away.</p><p>The cuckoo is singing right now. And the trees have flowered right
now. It is all beautiful this moment. It will never be more beautiful.
It has never been less beautiful. Each moment is perfect. But you start
thinking about the tomorrow. Then the whole glory is there, somewhere
away from you, and here you are a miserable creature, crying and weeping
for the goal.</p><p>You create the meantime. I am not talking about the meantime. I am
not talking about time at all, so what to say about meantime? I am
talking about the eternal moment, about eternity.</p><p>You bring time in. The mind always brings time in. Time is a mind
faculty. Osho - The First Principle</p><p>165</p><p>Chapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray</p><p>The mind cannot be herenow. The mind says, "Right. Hoard this,
whatsoever Osho is saying. Hoard it. Someday we are going to practice
it, and one day we are going to attain to this Buddhahood. It sounds
great." Then the misery, then the sadness. Then you will remain
miserable your whole life. This Buddhahood will never happen, because
you missed it in the first place.</p><p>You have become so miserable that you cannot trust me that the
celebration is possible right now. You say, "First one has to prepare.
First one has to become this and that. First one has to meditate. First
one has to become a great saint. First one has to become virtuous." This
is something which from the very childhood has been deeply conditioned
on your mind.</p><p>The parents, the teachers, the schools, the universities, the priest,
the politician, they all have been teaching you, "Get ready. Get ready;
something is going to happen." And then you go on getting ready -- and
one day you simply die, just getting ready. It never happens. When you
were a child they were saying, "Wait, grow up, first be educated. Go to
the university, come back home." Thrilled, you go to the university and
you suffer all sorts of tortures there, in the hope that it is not going
to last forever, in the hope that now you are getting ready. You don't
know what for, what you are getting ready for.</p><p>To listen to this cuckoo singing? To watch a bird on the wing? To see
a full moon in the night? To hold a friend's hand? To love? For what?
Because all this is available right now.</p><p>You go to the university, you go through a thousand and one
imprisonments; by the time you come back home you are destroyed. It is
very rare; very fortunate people come back from the university without
being destroyed by the education system.</p><p>Then they come home. Then the father says, "Now find a job -- and get
ready. Get married, and get ready. Then everything is going to be
beautiful." And you read the novels and you go to the movie and you see
the film, and once the marriage happens, the story says, "Ever
afterwards they lived in happiness." Have you ever seen anybody living
after marriage and happy? But these stories circulate, they condition
the mind: Get ready.</p><p>So one day you find a job. Another humiliation. One day you get
married.</p><p>Another distraction from the moment. And so on, so forth. Then you go
on missing, it is not happening, so somebody says, "How can you have it
unless you have a child?" Right. So get ready, have a child. And so on,
so forth.</p><p>Finally you recognize the fact that the whole life has been a
wastage.</p><p>I am not saying don't go to the university, and I am not saying don't
get married, I am not saying don't get a job. Please, don't
misunderstand me. What I am saying is: For happiness don't get ready, it
is already here. Go to the university. Enjoy. Have a job, but enjoy it.
It is not going to lead to happiness. Each moment is an end unto itself;
it is not to be converted into a means towards something else. Love, and
enjoy love. Don't think that you will be happy while you are married.
Get married, and BE happy. Don't think that when you will have a child
and you will become a mother or a father then you will be happy. Have
you not seen your mother and your father? So what are you hoping for?
And don't wait and don't go on postponing.</p><p>The greatest calamity that has happened to humanity is postponement
-- always postponing. There are people who are always looking at the
timetable and thinking about where to go on the holidays, what trains to
catch and what planes to go by, this place or that, to the Himalayas or
to the Alps, to Kashmir or to Switzerland. And they are always preparing
and preparing, and they never go. What will you say about these people?
You will think they Osho - The First Principle</p><p>166</p><p>Chapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray</p><p>are mad. They have all the guidebooks and all the maps of the world
and all the literature that government information services go on
publishing. They have a whole library, and they go on looking into it
and they go on preparing, but they always prepare and they never go.
What will you think about them? Will you not call them neurotic?</p><p>This is what the situation is with everybody. You always talk about
God, you always talk about MOKSHA, nirvana, heaven, paradise, you always
talk about it, but it is always tomorrow. So you have to prepare.
"Meantime" you prepare.</p><p>I am saying there is no meantime. God is available right now, just
for the asking.</p><p>Start enjoying. Don't ask how to dance! Start dancing. Can't you move
your body? It may not be very graceful. So who bothers? It may not be a
trained, disciplined thing. So who bothers? Start dancing. Don't go on
consulting manuals about love. Start loving. Don't go on and on in the
mind. Start moving into existence, be existential. That is the message
of Zen.</p><p>Question</p><p>OSHO, ARE YOU REALLY CRAZY?</p><p>How can I be crazy? I have no mind out of which to go. Question</p><p>AS SIN CAN BE DEFINED AS "MISSING THE MARK", COULD ONE DEFINE ZEN</p><p>AS "HITTING THE MARK"?</p><p>The question is from Yoga Anando.</p><p>No. Sin means missing the mark. Zen means there is no mark to miss.
There is nothing, no target. There is no destiny. It is all beautiful
purposelessness. It is all beautiful meaninglessness. It is a song. It
has no meaning. It has a rhythm, but no meaning. It has tremendous
beauty in it, but no logic. And it is not a syllogism; there is no
conclusion. It is an unconcluded existence, and it remains always
unconcluded.</p><p>We are always in the middle. There has been no source, and there is
no goal.</p><p>Sin exactly means missing the mark. That's why Zen people don't talk
about sin. Christians talk about sin, because they think God has to be
achieved, heaven has to be achieved, there is some goal. If you miss
that goal, that is what is called sin; sin means missing the goal. Zen
people don't talk about sin. The word "sin" exists not for them, because
there is no goal to miss. You are already at it! The arrow has reached,
the arrow has always been there, not for a single moment has it been
otherwise. Zen is so profound. It gives you utter freedom to be. It does
not yoke you to some ideology and doesn't yoke you into some guilt.</p><p>The moment you talk about sin, guilt arises. The moment you start
thinking you</p><p>are missing the mark, tension arises, anxiety arises, anguish arises:
"So how not to miss?" Then there is great trembling, and then the fear
you may go on missing. Who knows? -- for so long you have been missing.
So who knows, you may go on missing. You may go astray.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 167</p><p>Chapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray</p><p>Christianity talks in terms of duality. You are separate from God, so
you can miss him, you can move in a wrong direction, you can go astray.
Zen is nondual. It says you are in God, you cannot go astray. See the
beauty of it. See the great declaration. See the declaration of
freedom</p><p>-- utter freedom.</p><p>Freedom from the goal is utter freedom because the goal keeps you
tied together in a direction. Zen has no direction. When you have a
direction to move in, you will have to choose where to go. And the fear
will always remain, whether you are going in the right direction or not.
Who knows? -- even your leader may be wrong. The one who is leading you
may himself be misguided or may be a cheat. Who knows? And if you come
close to your priest and your leader, you will become more
suspicious.</p><p>Gurdjieff used to say that if you want to get rid of religion, live
near the priests. Then you will get rid of religion because you will see
they are trembling as much as you are trembling.</p><p>Their public faces are different, their private faces are different.
Live close to a priest, and you will be surprised. He is as much in the
dark as anybody else. He just pretends. He is as blind as anybody else,
but he goes to the masses and pretends to the blind people that "I have
eyes."</p><p>And all religions depend on priests. Why don't the priests say the
truth? They cannot, because their whole trade depends on one secret,
that they have to go on pretending that they have eyes. That pretension
is very basic to the trade of the priest.</p><p>And one priest may fight against another priest -- the Hindu priest
may say something against Christianity and the Christian priest may say
something about Hinduism -- but they never say anything against
priesthood. Never.</p><p>I have heard a beautiful anecdote. Meditate over it.</p><p>The little island in the South Pacific was in an uproar when the
American missionary visited the chief of the tribe. "What is the
commotion?" demanded the missionary.</p><p>"There is a white baby born in the village," replied the savage, "and
you know we don't like no man messing around with our women. Since you
is the only white man on the island they is fixing to fry you
alive."</p><p>The missionary was in a state of nervous collapse when he spied a
flock of sheep on the hillside behind the village. Turning to the chief
he cried, "Look there on the hillside, chief, you see that flock of
white sheep?"</p><p>"I sure do," replied the chief.</p><p>"Well," said the missionary. "Do you see the black sheep in the
middle of the flock?"</p><p>"I see it," responded the chief.</p><p>"There is no other black sheep and there never has been, has there?"
"Well?"</p><p>"Well."</p><p>The chief beckoned the missionary aside and whispered in his ear,
"You not tell, me not tell."</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 168</p><p>Chapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray</p><p>This is how it goes on. They have to protect each other. They may
fight about</p><p>dogmas, they may fight about principles, philosophies, that is all
okay. But they never say anything against the priesthood. The
Shankaracharya of Puri will be as much in favour of the priesthood as
the Vatican Pope. There will be no problem about that, no conflict about
that. If priesthood is at stake, they will all fight for it.</p><p>When Buddha declared these ultimate truths in India, there were many
religions in India.</p><p>They all went against him. Not only Hindus, Jainas were against him.
Not only Jainas, Ajeevekas were against him. And so many others. Why?
Whenever a real man is there, all priests will be against him because
the real man will bring the message to you that you are being led by
blind people: they don't know; you don't know. The blind are leading the
blind.</p><p>Zen says there is no need to be led by anybody, because there is
nowhere to go. This is Cutting the very root of priesthood. Look at it.
This is destroying priesthood totally. Zen does not say that one priest
is right and another is wrong. If it is said that way, then priesthood
is still protected. Zen says there is nowhere to go.</p><p>A man came to Nansen and asked, "What do you say? Is Zen the right
way to achieve God?" Nansen said, "Zen is not a way at all, it is not a
path, because a path leads somewhere.</p><p>We don't lead. A path reaches somewhere. We don't lead you anywhere.
We simply throw you to where you are. We simply throw you back to
yourself."</p><p>If it is a path, then leaders will be there. If something has to be
done, then you will find people mediating between you and God, between
you and reality. Nothing has to be done, so nobody has to show and guide
you. You alone are enough.</p><p>Zen is not "hitting the mark". Zen is knowing that there is no mark
and nowhere to hit, that you are the target, and the arrow has always
been in the target.</p><p>You must have heard the great Tibetan mantra "AUM MANE PADME HUM". It
has many meanings. One meaning is "Look! The arrow is already in the
target." AUM is just a shout, so that you can look; it is almost "See!"
"Look!" -- "Aum! mane padme hum." Literally it means "jewel in the
lotus" "mane padme hum".</p><p>Jewel in the lotus. Literally it means "Look!</p><p>The jewel is already in the lotus." Metaphorically it means "Look!
The arrow has already reached the target."</p><p>You are at home already, so it is not "hitting the mark", because
"hitting the mark" will again be the same thing. Then you will ask, "How
to hit it?" Then one has to learn archery, then one has to go through
discipline, and then the whole priesthood comes in from the back
door.</p><p>I have heard:</p><p>One summer's day when a man in a rowing boat caught a cramp and fell
into the water -- it was an ornamental lake -- arms and legs wildly
flailing, he screamed, "Help, Help! I can't swim!" Finally a bystander
shouted back, "Stand up, you bloody fool!" The drowning man did so --
and found that the water just came up to his waist.</p><p>But he was thinking he was drowning. The water just came up to his
waist. You are not drowning. Just stand up!</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 169</p><p>Chapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray</p><p>I have heard another story. A traveler lost his track one night in
the hills. It was a dark night, and he was very much afraid. The hills
were very tricky and dangerous and the track was very narrow, and he was
afraid he could miss a step and could disappear forever in the valley.
He could fall into any abyss; they were all around. So he was just
creeping on his hands. Still he fell, he slipped. He caught hold in time
of the roots of a tree. Now, he was very much afraid. He tried hard
somehow to get out of that hole he was hanging in, but he could not. And
it was getting colder and colder and his hands started becoming frozen,
and now he was certain that it was a question of minutes. Once the hands
are too cold, he would not be able to hold onto the roots, and he would
die. That became certain. Now there was no way to escape.</p><p>He started crying and weeping, and he started praying, and he had
never been a theist, but in such moments nobody bothers about
principles. He started saying to God, "Save me," this and that, and "I
will not do this sin or that sin, and I will be straight now; I will not
drink and I will not smoke," and all sorts of things he was promising.
But no help came, and by and by his hands started slipping, and a moment
came when he thought, "Now it is finished." And he fell.</p><p>And to his surprise, he was standing on his feet. There was no abyss
there; it was just plain ground. For hours he was hanging between life
and death.</p><p>Once you stop planning, you will suddenly be on plain ground. Once
you stop thinking about the target and how to hit it, you will be at
home. Zen says drop all ways, because all ways lead astray, because to
God there is no need of any way. He is there in your heart. It is he who
is listening to me, it is he who is talking to you. It is he who is
breathing in you, it is he who is beating in your heart. God is not far
away. God is not even outside. God is the innermost core of you.</p><p>So drop this sin-oriented idea of hitting or missing. Both are in the
same category; both will create anxiety.</p><p>My whole effort here is to make you free of anxiety, free of guilt.
Free of guilt, free of anxiety, you are a saint, because you are
innocent then, you are a child again. You are born again.</p><p>Question</p><p>YOU CONFUSED ME VERY MUCH BY SAYING THAT THE SAMSARA IS THE</p><p>NIRVANA. NOW, FROM WHERE TO BEGIN?</p><p>There is no need to begin. I am not sending you on a journey. Not
even the first step is needed. Take the step, and you have moved in the
wrong direction. It is not that any direction is wrong; all directions
are wrong. Movement is wrong. It is not that a few people go astray and
a few don't, no. All going is going astray.</p><p>Let this sink in your heart as deeply as possible.</p><p>When I say the world is samsara, I mean don't divide into the profane
and the profound.</p><p>Live the profound in a profound way, live the profane in a profound
way. Don't divide into the material and the spiritual. Live the material
in a spiritual way; bring the quality of the spirit to matter.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 170</p><p>Chapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray</p><p>What do I mean when I say live in the ordinary world? I mean live the
profane life in a new way, with a new being, with a new style, with a
new flavor, the flavor of meditation.</p><p>I am not telling you to go away anywhere.</p><p>I am for God, but I am not against anything. And God, my God, is so
vast, he includes all.</p><p>Yes, you can sip your tea in such a meditative way that it becomes
prayer. Try it. You can love your woman in such a meditative way that
love becomes ecstasy, that when you are lost with your woman or with
your man, suddenly you are lost in God. Those moments become of
tremendous value. Those moments become the first glimpses of
divinity.</p><p>Start living your ordinary life in an extraordinary way. What is the
extraordinary way? To bring awareness. Whatsoever you do, let it be
soaked in awareness, let it be showered with awareness.</p><p>Question</p><p>WHAT IS MATURITY? HOW CAN I BE MATURE?</p><p>You will have to understand first what immaturity is. That will give
you the idea of what maturity is. Immaturity has a few ingredients in
it. One, immaturity is a sort of dependence. A child depends on the
parents; he is immature. If you are still depending, you are
immature.</p><p>You may depend on God or you may depend on me, but it is immaturity.
You are still seeking your parents. Maybe your parents are gone and
lost; now you are</p><p>projecting your parents.</p><p>There are many people who come to me and I can see immediately in
their eyes they are searching for their father. It is not accidental
that the pope is called the pope. "Pope" means</p><p>"papa". People are looking for a divine daddy, continuously. This is
immaturity.</p><p>When are you going to stand on your own feet? How long are you going
to remain a dependent on the mother, on the father, on this and
that?</p><p>These dependent people are very dangerous people because they can be
exploited easily.</p><p>Anybody who pretends to be their father, they will become victims to
him. They will follow Adolf Hitler; the fuhrer will become their father.
The Germans used to call their country the</p><p>"fatherland", others call their countries the "motherland", but it is
all the same nonsense. We go on projecting. The country becomes the
mother, the country becomes the father, or God the Father, or Kali the
Mother. You go on projecting.</p><p>You want to remain a child; you don't want to grow. Growth is
responsibility, and you don't want to take any responsibility.</p><p>People come to me and they say, "Osho, we surrender to you. Now you
are responsible."</p><p>How can I be responsible for you? Surrender can only mean that you
have come to me to learn responsibility. Now you want to avoid
responsibility. Surrendering to me can only be a way, a means, to learn
to be responsible. But if you want surrender as a substitute for
responsibility, your surrender is wrong, ill. It is not healthy, it is
dangerous. And then you will start getting angry at me. If nothing is
happening you will get angry. Because nothing is happening, you will
think I am not doing anything.</p><p>Only you can do something. I can indicate, but the real thing is
going to happen within you. Nobody else can do it. If I can do it, then
I can undo it also. That will not be much of a Osho - The First
Principle</p><p>171</p><p>Chapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray</p><p>gain. If Buddha can deliver you from your ignorance, then one day if
he gets angry with you he will release all your ignorance again, back to
you. That will not be of much use. Freedom is possible only when you
learn responsibility, when you start standing on your own feet.</p><p>Of course, one feels very helpless. So what? It is how life is. That
helplessness is not bad.</p><p>It teaches you that ego is wrong, that you have to be humble,
helpless. And yet there is no other way to stand: you can stand only on
your own feet. Nobody can take you on his shoulders to God. You will
have to enter into divinity on your own.</p><p>So maturity has to be understood through understanding immaturity.
First thing: we are taught to be dependent on the parents, on the
leaders, on the priests. Nobody wants you to be free, because people are
afraid, the society is afraid, of free people. Free people will be
rebellious. Free people will start doing THEIR thing, and the society is
very much afraid of such people. The society wants you to do things that
the society wants. The society wants you to follow a certain pattern.
The society has its own goals; they have to be fulfilled. The society
does not want you to become a Buddha or a Christ, because they have
always been dangerous people. The society wants just zombies. And an
immature person can easily become a zombie because he is an
imitator.</p><p>Have you watched small children imitating, and by imitation they
think they are becoming grown-ups? Small children start smoking. Not
that they feel very good about smoking, not that it is great or
anything. When a child starts smoking he cannot even believe why people
smoke, because his eyes start getting red, his throat feels irritated,
and he starts coughing, tears come down his cheeks. It is really
painful, but he will tolerate the pain because the cigarette gives a
certain feeling that he is a grown-up. Only grown-ups are allowed to
smoke, so the smoking becomes a symbol of grown-upness.</p><p>I have heard:</p><p>A man walking down the street noticed a small boy about ten years old
sitting on</p><p>the front doorstep of a house, smoking a cigarette. "Aren't you a
little young to be smoking?" he asked.</p><p>"Of course I ain't," replied the lad. "I got a girlfriend and all."
"A girlfriend!" said the man.</p><p>"Yeah, Picked her up last night, I did. Smashing it was." "Good Lord!
How old was she?"</p><p>"I dunno. I was too drunk to ask her."</p><p>There are symbols of grown-upness. You need to have a girlfriend, you
have to smoke, you have to drink, and even small children start learning
these tricks. And then they never grow up, They only imitate, They
imitate other, false grownups. And their children will imitate them, and
so on it goes.</p><p>This world is a world of imitators, monkeys all. And it does not make
much difference --</p><p>you can be a chairman of the board of monkeys, that doesn't make much
difference; or you can be a president of a monkey country, that doesn't
make any difference -- all the same you remain the monkey. Maybe you are
more monkeyish than others.</p><p>Osho - The First Principle 172</p><p>Chapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray</p><p>A grown-up person is one who does not imitate, who starts feeling his
own way, who starts being in his own way, who starts looking into his
nature: "Who am I? And what REALLY do I feel?"</p><p>One woman came home, driving, she got out of her car, and fell down
flat on the ground.</p><p>The husband rushed, asked, "What is the matter? What happened? Why
did you</p><p>faint?"</p><p>She said, "It was too hot."</p><p>The husband looked at the car and he said, "But why didn't you open
the windows?"</p><p>She said, "What! Open the windows, and let the neighbours know that
our car is not air conditioned?"</p><p>One can die but cannot allow the neighbours to know that the car is
not air conditioned.</p><p>She had to keep the windows closed. She was fainting, but that is
okay, but to keep the windows open hurts much more.</p><p>Listen to your being. It is continuously giving you hints; it is a
still, small voice. It does not shout at you, that is true. And if you
are a little silent you will start feeling your way. Be the person you
are. Never try to be another, and you will become mature. Maturity is
accepting the responsibility of being oneself, whatsoever the cost.
Risking all to be oneself, that's what maturity is all about.</p><p>If you imitate you will again and again fall into a ditch because
whatsoever you imitate never fits reality. Reality is continuously
changing, it is a flux, nothing is ever the same. It is a river; it goes
on flowing.</p><p>If you imitate your father ... Just see, your father lived many years
before. Your father was a child maybe thirty years before or forty years
before. He learned things in a different world.</p><p>For example, your father, when he was a child, was not sitting five
hours glued to the chair before the TV. Now, you don't know how much the
TV has done to the small children. The father does not know. His
childhood was not at all influenced by the TV. Five hours sitting before
a TV is no ordinary phenomenon.</p><p>In fact, before TV happened, down the centuries, people had never
looked into a source of light for five hours continuously. Now the
scientists say that the whole nervous system changes because of those
five hours of looking directly into the source of light. The TV goes on
throwing strong rays on your eyes. It has never happened before. Five
hours is too much.</p><p>Scientists may if you sit near a color TV, four feet away, you will
get cancer, you will suffer from many diseases which your parents had
not known, ever. The eyes are eighty percent of your life. Five hours of
just strong light rays reaching into your head -- your sleep will be
disturbed. If America suffers from insomnia, it is natural. The TV is
one of the basic causes.</p><p>Ordinarily man has lived with light, natural light. In a primitive
society, the sun rises, people rise, and the sun sets and people set,
people go to sleep. A natural rhythm with light.</p><p>Now we are living too much with the light; the eyes are not made for
that much light. The inner nervous system is disturbed; it becomes too
loaded.</p><p>And a thousand and one things will happen. In America a new
phenomenon is happening.</p><p>Many places it has happened, and people have become really worried
about it, what to do? In one place a woman was murdered, and twenty
persons were standing there, almost paralyzed, not doing anything. A
psychological investigation was done. What is the matter? Twenty young,
healthy people standing there, and a woman was killed just in front of
them and they Osho - The First Principle</p><p>173</p><p>Chapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray</p><p>didn't do anything -- they didn't even shout, they didn't call the
police. What happened? And you will be surprised. The finding is that it
is because these twenty people have lived on TV</p><p>for too long.</p><p>On the TV screen murder happens so many times. What do you do? You
don't do anything; you remain glued to your chair. They have become
accustomed to it. It was another TV scene. They have lost track of
reality. The TV has become more real. For five hours you are not with
anything else -- and a continuous bombardment of light, and strong
light, and things are moving in your head. You become a watcher. They
were standing there just glued to their spots, paralyzed -</p><p>- just watching. They could not do anything, because they are no more
doers.</p><p>Now, your father, who had a different kind of childhood, will not be
able to understand it.</p><p>You are living in a different world, in a world which is more of TV
watchers than of participants. Whatsoever he says will not be fit for
your world; hence the generation gap. The father speaks a different
language, you speak a different language. You live in a different world,
he lived in a different world. Now, those two worlds never coincide.</p><p>If you are an imitator you will always be taking false moves. You
have to learn to live in YOUR world; you have to respond to the reality
that surrounds you. Things have changed dramatically. They have always
been changing, but the change has been too fast in this century. And it
will be faster and faster.</p><p>You have to become aware of the situation and respond accordingly. An
experienced plumber was giving instructions to his apprentice.</p><p>"Working in other people's homes," he said, "can sometimes lead to
embarrassing situations, but you can always get out of them by using
tact. For example, the other day, I walked into a bathroom and found a
lady taking a bath. I backed out saying, 'Excuse me, sir.'</p><p>In that way, the lady thought I had not gotten a good look at her and
it was all right."</p><p>The following afternoon, the apprentice staggered into the office in
a beat-up condition.</p><p>"What happened to you?" asked the boss.</p><p>"You and your tact," cried the apprentice. "I went to the bridal
suite of the Etter Plaza Hotel to fix a faucet. I was halfway through
the bedroom before I realized there was a couple making love in the bed.
The husband cussed at me, but I remember what you had said, so I tipped
my hat and said, 'Excuse me, gentlemen!'"</p><p>If you simply follow and you don't understand, you are immature.
Never follow. Try to understand. Let understanding be your basic law of
life. Let things come out of your understanding, not out of your
memory.</p><p>The immature person functions through memory. Whenever there is a
situation he looks into his memory, into his past, and finds a clue. The
mature person looks into the situation, puts his past aside, because the
past is irrelevant. He brings his total attention to the present
situation and functions out of that totality. His action is in the
present. The immature person is always living through his past; the
immature person is always turning his future into his past.</p><p>He is repetitive, he is parrotlike, he is a shadow, a reflection. He
is not real. Osho - The First Principle</p><p>174</p><p>Chapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray</p><p>When a party of tourists climbed to the top of a famous echoing
mountain, they saw an old man, sitting on a rock, an enormous telescope
in his hands. Every few moments he let out a series of shouts.</p><p>The puzzled tourists watched him for some time. Then one of them went
up to the old man and asked, "Why do you keep looking through that thing
and then calling out as if you were in pain?"</p><p>The old man-answered impatiently, "Don't talk to me. You will
distract my attention and I will lose my job. I am the echo for this
hill."</p><p>Many people have become just echoes. Watch yourself when something
happens and you react. Are you reacting the same way as your father used
to react in such a situation? Are you saying the same thing as your
mother would have said if she were in this situation? Are your gestures
the same as your teacher's in the school you loved so much? Just watch
-- your gestures, your words, your actions -- and you will be surprised.
Ninety-nine percent they are just echoes, they are not true.</p><p>How can you be fulfilled with such echoes?</p><p>Your father is living through you, not you. Your parents are living
through you, not you.</p><p>Your parents' parents are living through you, not you. The whole of
humanity and its past is living through you, but not you. This is
immaturity.</p><p>Maturity means you discontinue with your past. With one stroke of the
sword you become discontinuous with your past and your heritage and the
tradition, and you start living independently. The gesture is yours;
then it is meaningful, then it is full of significance, then it is not
an empty gesture. The words are yours, not borrowed, not somebody
else's; then your life becomes more and more authentic and real.</p><p>To live in immaturity is to live in a kind of dream. It is a shadow
world. Your eyes are so full of fog, you don't have clarity.</p><p>A frustrated young man went to see his doctor.</p><p>"Doc," he explained, "every night I have the strangest dreams.
Beautiful blondes, brunettes, and redheads appear, and one by one they
try to kiss me and put their arms around me."</p><p>"So?" answered the doctor.</p><p>"So nothing, Doc. I keep pushing them away -- every one of them."
"What would you like me to do?"</p><p>"Doc, please," pleaded the patient, "break my arms."</p><p>People are living in their dreams. They are ready to break their real
arms for their unreal dreams.</p><p>Watch! You will find many times the same happening in your life. You
are ready to kill your reality for some unreal ideal, some utopia, some
ideology, some scripture. Somebody insults the Bible. Are you ready to
fight? Then you are a fool. Somebody says something Osho - The First
Principle</p><p>175</p><p>Chapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray</p><p>against Ram, and you are Hindu and you are ready to be killed or
kill. Then you are a fool.</p><p>Then you are living in shadows and you have become too attached to
shadows.</p><p>In fact, a really alert man will not feel offended even if somebody
insults him personally.</p><p>Even if somebody says something against his name, he will not feel
offended, because he will know, "I am not my name. The name is just an
appendage, a label -- useful, but not real, just a make-believe. Any
other name would be the same." He will not feel offended.</p><p>A really alert man, even if you hit his body, will not feel offended,
because he will know he is not the body. He will know he is not his
mind. He will know that he is something transcendental, and he will
remain in that transcendentalness. In that transcendence is his
being.</p><p>Then life will have a totally new quality and it will become a new
experience. That experience is divine. Maturity is the door to divinity.
Immature, you remain asleep. Mature, you become awake.</p><p>The question is from Prem Anam. He has many things which are immature
in him. His question is relevant, relevant to his being, and it is good
that he has asked.</p><p>Now, Anam, watch, become more careful. Drop your childishness more
and more.</p><p>I say again and again, I quote again and again, Jesus' saying that
"Unless you are like a child, you will not enter into my kingdom of
God." But remember, he does not mean childishness. Childishness is just
the opposite of being LIKE a child. A childish person is never like a
child. He pretends to be a grown-up; he is a pretender. A childlike
person is one who has become so mature, so alive, so aware, that he
drops all pretensions. He is nude and naked, he is true, he is
innocent.</p><p>Drop childishness, and become a child; and you will be mature. And
you will be ready, ready to take the jump into yourself.</p><p>Question</p><p>I SEEM TO BE MORE INTERESTED IN HELPING OTHERS REACH ENLIGHTENMENT
THAN REACHING IT MYSELF; HAVING GRASPED</p><p>IT</p><p>INTELLECTUALLY. I LOSE NO OPPORTUNITY OF TALKING ABOUT IT. THE EASE,
THE JOY, THE PEACE, AND THE ENERGY THAT I FEEL MAKE ME BELIEVE THAT</p><p>I AM ON THE RIGHT TRACK. BUT AM I? OR SHOULD I BETTER BE SILENT</p><p>TILL ...?</p><p>The question is from Ajit Saraswati.</p><p>For Ajit Saraswati it is perfectly right. He can continue. But
remember, I am saying so only to him, not to anybody else. It is a very
personal question.</p><p>He has nothing of the ego. He can go on. In fact, this too is part of
his humbleness, that he has asked.</p><p>It is good to help others, because there is nobody really who is
other. Helping others, you are helping yourself because we are parts of
each other, members of one another. We are joined together. If I help
you to be happy, I become happy. If I help you to be miserable, I Osho -
The First Principle</p><p>176</p><p>Chapter 10 - All Going Is Going Astray</p><p>become miserable. Our life is together here; it is a togetherness; we
are not separate. On the periphery we may be separate; at the center we
are one.</p><p>Nothing to be worried about. If you have the feeling that you enjoy
sharing whatsoever you have understood, howsoever little it is, if you
have the feeling that you enjoy, you feel blissful, you feel joyful --
and no ego arises out of it ... Let that be the criterion: if ego arises
out of it, then you are not helping others, and you are destroying
yourself meanwhile. If no ego arises --</p><p>you simply feel peaceful and silent and happy that you shared
something with somebody, a grace descends on you -- then you are
perfectly right. Then go on the housetops and shout.</p><p>When you have, share it.</p><p>And there is no need to wait, that when you have the whole of it,
then you will share it.</p><p>Then you will not have the whole, ever. Share it, and you will get
more. Give it, and you will get more.</p><p>But remember only one thing: the ego should not enter in. The moment
you see ego arising, the moment you see you are feeling great, superior
to others, holier than others, then something is going wrong. Then it is
better to wait. You are not to wait for the whole of God to happen to
you, but you are to wait for the whole of the ego to go.</p><p>With Ajit Saraswati, it is already the case. The ego is not there.
Slowly, slowly that rock has disappeared. I have been falling on him
like a waterfall. Yes, the ego was there one day.</p><p>And the water is very soft, so the rock never feels worried, but the
water goes on falling, goes on falling, goes on falling, and by and by,
unaware what is happening, the rock slowly, slowly disappears, becomes
sand, and is taken far away.</p><p>The rock was there, but it is not there. So enjoy it, delight in it,
rejoice, share. Question</p><p>OSHO, CAN YOU GIVE ME TWO VERY FUNDAMENTAL RULES FOR THE</p><p>SEEKERS?</p><p>Here are two ancient rules, very ancient:</p><p>First, that you must be like a man who has been bitten by a snake and
knows he has not a moment to lose.</p><p>And second, that you must be like a man who has awakened to find that
his horse has been stolen and it is too late to lock the door and there
is no hurry.</p><p>Question</p><p>OSHO, WHAT IS THE FIRST PRINCIPLE?</p><p>If I were to tell you, it would become the second principle. Osho -

I AM ONLY ASKING BECAUSE I FEEL THESE ARE THE</p><p>QUESTIONS WHICH ARE BURNING IN THE HEARTS OF MANY PEOPLE.</p><p>WHO ARE YOU? WHY HAVE YOU COME INTO THE WORLD? WHAT IS YOUR</p><p>WORK HERE, AND HOW WILL YOUR WORK BE ACCOMPLISHED?</p><p>It makes no difference whether these questions are personal or not
because to me the person does not exist. You cannot ask any personal
questions because there is no one to be related to as a person. In fact,
it is not presumptuous to ask personal questions, but to assume that a
person is is certainly presumptuous. The person is non-existent, a
non-entity. In fact, there is no person, or there is only one person.
Only God can be said to have a personality, because only God can have a
center. We have no centers at all.</p><p>The center is non-existent, but we assume a center. The center is
hypothetical, illusory.</p><p>We feel that without a center life is not possible. This assumed
center is the ego.</p><p>You can think that this question is personal. As far as the question
is arrowed toward me, it is arrowed toward a non-entity. As far as I am
concerned, I do not feel at all to be a person. The deeper one goes the
lesser one is. And once some one reaches to the ultimate core of
himself, there is no self at all.</p><p>Secondly, you ask, who am I? I say, "I am not." I always ask seekers
to ask, "Who am I?"</p><p>not in order that they will come to know who they are, but only in
order that a moment will come when the question is asked so intensely
that the questioner is not there; only the question remains. A moment is
bound to come when the question is absolutely intense, as deep as it can
go; then the absurdity of it is revealed. You come to know that there is
no one who can ask "Who am I?" or who can be asked "Who are you?" The
question is asked not to get any answer, but to transcend the
question.</p><p>There is no one inside; in fact, there is no inside at all and the
moment the inside</p><p>falls, there is also no outside. The moment you are not, inwardly,
then there is no outwardness.</p><p>Then the whole world becomes one whole. Then existence is one whole,
not divided into the dichotomy of I and thou.</p><p>So to me, the question "Who are you?" makes no sense at all. Rather,
"What is?" is the only relevant question -- not who? but what? because
the what can be the whole. It can be asked about the totality, about all
that exists.</p><p>The question "What is?" is existential, and there is no dichotomy in
it; it does not divide.</p><p>But the question "Who?" divides from the very start. It accepts the
duality, the multiplicity, the duality of beings.</p><p>There is only being, not beings.</p><p>When I say there is only being it means there is only beingness,
because one cannot exist apart from the other. If there is no other,
then to say that one exists is meaningless.</p><p>So there is not really being, but beingness. I always say that there
is no God, but divineness, because the very word 'being' carries a
limitation around it. The very word</p><p>'God' carries a finitude; it cannot be infinite. But beingness or
divineness becomes infinite; it comprehends all that is. It is all
inclusive, nothing is excluded. So when you ask, "Who are you?" the
question to me means "What is?" To me it cannot mean anything else
except that.</p><p>You have asked through me a very fundamental question. What is, is
not me but the very being, the very existence. If one goes deep into a
single drop, one will find the ocean.</p><p>Only on the surface a drop is just a drop. Being the existence
itself, the ultimate nature of the single drop of water is the same as
that of the ocean. It is oceanic. So only in ignorance is one a drop of
water. The moment one knows, there is an ocean.</p><p>You have asked me a question about the ocean. So when I answer it, I
am not answering about myself but about you also. When I am answering I
am not answering about me, but about all that exists.</p><p>What exists? There are so many layers. If one is only aware of the
surface, then matter exists. Matter is the surface of existence. Science
has been only on the surface, in search; to science only matter is real,
and all else is not. But now science has taken a step further and says
matter is not, but energy is. Energy is the second layer; it is deeper
than matter.</p><p>If one goes deep in matter, then there is no matter but energy. But
that too is not yet enough, because beyond energy consciousness
exists.</p><p>So when you ask, "Who are you?" I say, "I am consciousness." And this
answer is all inclusive -- everything is consciousness. I answer only as
a representative of all. You may not have heard that you are
consciousness, you may not have known that you are consciousness, but I
am answering even for you. Consciousness exists, and when I say
something exists, it carries for me a particular, definite meaning. When
I say something exists, it means it will never be in nonexistence. If
something can go into nonexistence, it would mean that it never really
existed. It was only phenomenal, it just appeared to exist.</p><p>So all that changes is phenomenal; it is not really existential. All
that changes is only the surface. The innermost, the ultimate core,
never changes. It is and is always in the present. You can never say it
was, you can never say it will be. Whenever it is, it is. Only the
present is applicable to it.</p><p>There is no past and no future, because the past and future become
relevant only when something changes. When something is, then there is
no past and future, but only the present. Of course, the meaning of
present will be different, quite different. For us, present means
something which exists between the past and the future. But if there is
no past and no future, then the present will be something very
different. It is not something in between the past and future. The
present is just a moment -- a moment between two nonexistentials: the
past that has gone and is no more and the future that has not yet come.
Between these two nonexistentials, one present moment exists. That is
impossible.</p><p>Between two nonexistentials there can be no existence. It only
appears so.</p><p>When I say consciousness exists, I do not mean something of the past
and future,</p><p>but something eternal -- not everlasting, because the word
'everlasting' carries the sense of time. When I say it always exists in
the present, I mean it is nontemporal; existence means it is
nontemporal. It is beyond time and, simultaneously, beyond space,
because all that is in space will become nonexistential. Similarly, all
that is in time will become nonexistential. And time and space are not
two things. That is why I relate them. They are one. Time is only a
dimension of space. The movement in space is time; nonmoving time is
space. Existence is nontemporal and nonspatial.</p><p>So I think you will understand when I say I am someone who is
nontemporal and nonspatial. But my I is all-inclusive. You are included,
the questioner is included.</p><p>Nothing is excluded. Then it will be easier to answer your inquiry.
All that changes is purposive; there is something to be done, it exists
for a purpose. The moment the purpose is fulfilled, it goes into
nonexistence.</p><p>But all that is really existential is nonpurposive, because there is
no purpose which can be fulfilled. And if there is any purpose and it is
fulfilled, then existence will become meaningless. So only temporal
things have purposes. They are meant for something. You can say it in
this way: they are means to some end. That is what is meant by
purposive.</p><p>They exist for something to be fulfilled. The moment it is fulfilled,
they go. But I will be needed always, and when I say "I," that is all
inclusive. There is no purpose in it.</p><p>Existence is nonpurposive. That is why it is called a leela, a play.
The existence itself has no purpose to fulfill. It is not going
somewhere. There is no end to it. But still it is going, still much is
going. So it must be a leela, a play -- only outflowing energy. This can
be related to me. I am not to be anything at all. Even then, I talk of
doing things.</p><p>Once you have known that you are a part of the cosmic consciousness,
you will realize there is no purpose. You just exist as a play; of
course the play becomes cosmic, multidimensional. You do much, and still
there is no doer and there is no purpose; those things are not there. It
then becomes a play.</p><p>And this must be noted: that a doer cannot exist without a purpose,
and a purpose cannot exist without a doer. They are two polarities of
one ego, and ego</p><p>feels very uncomfortable if there is no purpose. Ego is fulfilled
through purposes. Something is to be done, one is to succeed in doing
that, one is to reach somewhere, one is to make something. One has to
make a signature. Thus the ego is purposive. Existence, on the other
hand, is not purposive. And unless you know that which is beyond the
ego, you have not known at all.</p><p>So to me, everything is just a play. Neither I am nor is there any
purpose. Yet things are going. So it can be asked, "Why are they going?"
They are going because there is no purpose in stopping, and there is no
one to stop them. You understand me? There is no one to stop, and there
is no purpose to stop. So it is there in nature to go. You become a
passage. Actively you cannot be a passage, you can never be a medium.
Only passivity makes you a medium, and passivity means that you are not.
Otherwise, you are verbally passive. The ego is always active. The
moment you are passive, the ego is not. Passivity means egolessness.</p><p>So I am totally passive. Whatever happens, happens. I never question
"Why?" because there is no one to be asked. And even if you find
someone, God himself, he will just laugh. Even he cannot answer it. He
cannot answer it because the concept of causality, the concept of why,
is meaningful only in a divided flux. If you take a beginning and an
end, then causality becomes meaningful. If you understand the whole flux
as endless, beginningless, then all things go into other things and all
things come from other things.</p><p>Just like waves in the ocean, every wave has some wave behind and
every wave has something in front, something ahead, another wave. And
the whole ocean has waves. The waves are eternal.</p><p>No one asks, "Why?" except human beings. So no one else is in any
anxiety at all.</p><p>When the human mind becomes anxious, it creates questions and then
supplies the answers. The questions are meaningless, hence the answers
are more so. But because we fabricate questions, we cannot be at ease
unless we find the answers. Therefore, we go on finding answers and
creating questions. If you see this whole nonsense of asking questions
and answering them, you may find that you are carrying on a monologue
with yourself. Even if you are asking and I am answering, it is the
human mind asking and the human mind answering. It is just a
hide-and-seek of the same mind. It makes no difference who is asking and
who is answering.</p><p>The human mind questions, and the human mind answers, and we have
created such a great mess of answers and questions, but not a single
question has been answered. The questions remain where they were always.
If you can see this whole procession of questions and answers, this
meaningless, fruitless effort leading nowhere -- if you become aware of
this whole nonsense as if in a flash of lightning -- then you can laugh
at the absurdity of the human mind. And the moment there is laughter,
you transcend the human mind completely. Then there is no question, and
then there is no answer. Then you love. There is no purpose, and there
is no cause. Then living itself is enough.</p><p>You ask and I answer you, but I myself cannot ask any questions. As
far as I am concerned there is no answer, and there is no question. I go
on living just like the waves in the ocean or just like leaves of the
tree or just like clouds in the sky, without any question and without
any answer. And the moment I became aware of this whole absurdity of
questions, something fell down completely, totally. It was a
resurrection. I was reborn, reborn in a cosmic dimension -- not as an I,
but as cosmic consciousness itself.</p><p>In this cosmic dimension, everything is a play. Once you understand
-- not only understand but realize that all is a play -- you are at ease
completely, absolutely. Then there is no tension. You are relaxed. There
is no ego.</p><p>The ego cannot relax. It lives on tensions, it feeds on tensions.
When there is no ego, then there is no tension. Then there you are --
all inclusive. Then there is no past, and then there is no future. You
are eternity. Then anything that happens is a happening, it is not that
you are doing it. It is not that something is to be fulfilled through
you. These are all illusory notions. And even a religious person will
think in these terms -- of doing something. Then the ego has become
settled, pious, and more dangerous. If the ego is there, then both the
doer and the doings are there. Only the objects have changed, but the
process is the same.</p><p>To me... and when I refer to "me," there is no one who is being
referred to; it is only a linguistic device in order that you may
understand what I say. To me, there is no one who can be referred to as
me or you. But then language will be impossible. That is why truth
cannot be expressed in language. It cannot take on any linguistic form,
because language is created by those who are not -- by untrue ones,
nonexistential ones. The mythical ego has created the language. It comes
out of ego, it can never transcend it. So even if you know that there is
no one who can be referred to as "me" you have to use it in
language.</p><p>And I remind you that there is no one.</p><p>As far as this "me" is concerned, nothing is to be done because
things happen by themselves. We ourselves happen. We are happenings. The
whole existence is a happening, not a doing. So it would be better if I
say that the old concept of God as creator is not meaningful to me -- I
will not say "God the creator," because the expression reflects our
egoistic conceptions of creation, of doing. As we "do" something, so has
God</p><p>"made" the world. We have projected ourselves onto the cosmic plane,
so there is creation and the creator. The dichotomy is there.</p><p>To me, God is that which happens -- not the creator, but that which
goes on happening.</p><p>God means that which goes on eternally. So anything that happens is
God. You and everyone are happenings. This eternal happening is God.
There is no creator and no creation. The very dichotomy is egoistic --
our projections onto the cosmic plane.</p><p>Once you know that in yourself there is no dichotomy of doing and the
doer, then you know that there is no doer and no doing -- only
happenings. And once there is this revelation of eternal happening,
there is no burden, there is no tension. Your birth is a happening, and
your death will be a happening. Your being here is a happening, your not
being here will be a happening. You are nowhere.</p><p>From where does this ego come which thinks "I am"..."I am doing"? It
comes through memory. Your memory goes on recording happenings. You are
born, you are a child, then youth comes, then you are old. Things happen
-- love happens, hatred happens, and the memory goes on recording. When
you look at the past, the whole accumulated memory becomes "I". "I"
loved someone. It would be better and more exact to say that somewhere
love happened, I was not the doer. But the memory that "I loved" has
happened just like birth, just like death.</p><p>If a person can remember this only for twenty-four hours, that things
are happening and there is no doer, he will not be the same again. But
it is very arduous to remember even for a single moment.</p><p>It is the most arduous thing to remember that events are happening
and you are not the doer. For example, I am speaking. If I say, "I am
speaking" and mean that "I" am speaking, then I have misinterpreted the
phenomenon. I do not know what the next sentence will be. When it comes
you will know it and I will know it. It is a happening, so I cannot
relate myself to it. Something comes through me. I am not at all a
doer.</p><p>Something happens in me.</p><p>This is what is meant when we say the Vedas are impersonal. We say
they are not created by persons. We mean by this that those who compiled
the Vedas know this fact -- the fact that something is a happening. They
are not doers, something is coming to them. They are only the passage,
the medium, the vehicle, and even this being a vehicle is a happening.
It is not their doing that they have become vehicles. Otherwise, the
same fallacy will be there on another level.</p><p>So go deep in any of your acts, and you will find happenings there.
There will be no act, because there is no actor. So how can one ask why?
Who can answer this? The house is vacant, the owner is not. Let things
go on happening. The house itself without the owner is capable of
happenings.</p><p>Try to understand it more clearly. Buddha said so many times, "When
we walk there is no walker, only the walk." How can this be understood?
If I am not, how can I walk?</p><p>Walk, and find where you are -- you will find only the walk. We
cannot understand how some one can say there is speaking and no speaker.
But as you go deep in the act of speaking, you will find no speaker but
just speaking. In fact, there have been no poets, only poetry has
happened. There have been no painters, only painting has been happening,
but the vehicle becomes the owner.</p><p>The memory creates the fallacy. But to me the fallacy is not. The
memory cannot trap me, it has lost its grip on me. So everything
happens, but there is no doer. And all that will happen, will happen. I
will not be the primer; I will not be the master.</p><p>Once you know that you are not, you become a master in a very
different sense. And if you are not, then you cannot be made a slave,
negatively. Now your freedom is total.</p><p>Now no one can make you a slave. Now neither can there be any slavery
nor any possibility of it. Although a paradoxical situation, it is a
fact -- one who tries to be a master is always in danger of becoming a
slave. One who loses himself, his mastery, his efforts, his doer, is now
beyond any slavery. He is free, as free as the sky. He is freedom itself
-- not even free, because when one is free the agent is there. He is
freedom. So if you like, I will say, I am freedom. And there is no
reason, because if there is any reason then you are not free. You are
bound to it, tethered to the reason. If there is anything which you are
to do, then you are tethered. Then you are not free.</p><p>I am absolute freedom in the sense that nothing is to be done. I am
an awaiting. Things will happen, and I will accept them. And if they do
not happen, then I will accept the non-happening. And I go on waiting.
This waiting makes one a medium for the divine forces of existence. Much
is done through you when the doer is not, and nothing is done through
you when the doer is there. When the doer is there, you are. You are
doing something which is impossible. Because the doer is impossible, the
doing cannot be possible.</p><p>You are engaged in an absurd effort, and only frustration will be the
result. When you are not, you always succeed. There can be no failure,
because you have never thought of being anything; and even if failure
happens, it is a happening. If success happens, it is a happening. And
when both are happening, you become indifferent. It makes no difference;
either one will do.</p><p>So I may conclude that when I say "I," everyone is included. I am
consciousness, and I am freedom. I use two words, 'consciousness' and
'freedom', only to make the mystery more understandable for you.
Otherwise both have the same meaning. Consciousness is freedom, freedom
is consciousness. The less the freedom, the more there is matter. The
more there is freedom, the more there is consciousness.</p><p>When we say this table is "material," we mean to say that it is not
free to move. When we say you are a conscious being, you are free to
some extent. But if you become consciousness itself, as you go deep and
know the source.â¦</p><p>I know that you are consciousness itself, not the conscious being.
Consciousness is not a quality attached to you, you are consciousness.
You are totally free.</p><p>So proceed from anywhere. Either be more free or be more conscious,
and the</p><p>other will result automatically. Be more free, and you will be more
conscious. You cannot be more free unless you are more conscious. Be
more conscious and you will be more free; you cannot be otherwise,
because consciousness creates freedom. And when you are absolutely
conscious, you are absolutely free. Then there is no cause and no
purpose for you to exist. Then everything is a happening, and a
happening is a leela.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>ARE YOU SELF-REALIZED? AND HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN YOUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH
EXISTENCE AND WITH PEOPLE?</p><p>The word you say, 'self-realized', is not right, because realization
always means a transcendence of the self. The word 'self-realization' is
therefore contradictory. If you realize, you know there is no self. If
you do not realize, then there is the self. Whereas selfhood is
non-realization, realization is non-selfhood. So I cannot say I am
self-realized.</p><p>I can only say there is no self now!</p><p>There was a self -- that was only up to the door. The moment you
enter the temple of realization, you find it no more. It is a shadow
which follows you up to the door, and not only follows you but clings to
you -- but only up to the door, it cannot enter the temple. If you have
to save it you will have to remain outside. The self is the last thing
one has to throw. One can throw everything, but to throw the self is so
impossible, because the effort for self-realization, the endeavor for
self-realization, is an effort of the self for the self. The moment you
realize, you will not be; you will not try.</p><p>So all the great teachers have used words which are fallacious,
'Self-realization' is a fallacious word. But you do not understand if
they say 'no-self realization'. It will become absurd. But that is the
real thing -- no-self realization. Only Buddha used anatta, no-self.</p><p>Only Buddha used it. That is why Buddha was uprooted from India. He
was just thrown out, and Buddhism could not get roots unless Buddhism
began to use the word 'self-realization'. In China and Japan Buddhism
again came back, and they</p><p>began again to use</p><p>'self-realization'. Buddha used 'no-self realization'. I am also
using no-self realization.</p><p>That is the only realization.</p><p>The moment there is no self you have become cosmic. It is a great
game! To know the self is the only, no doubt the greatest, the ultimate,
game. The self is not something which is to be protected; it is
something to be destroyed. It is something which is the barrier to your
ultimate potentiality, to your ultimate realization.</p><p>So I cannot say I am self-realized. I will say, I am no-self
realized, and that is the only realization that is possible. No other
realization exists. The emphasis of all who claim self-realization is on
the self and not on realization. My emphasis is on realization. That is
why I emphatically deny the self.</p><p>How am I related to the cosmos and to other people? Relationship
exists between two selves. I am one who is not related, one who is not
in relationship. Relationship is always between two. This may look
paradoxical, but in every relationship you remain unrelated.</p><p>Howsoever you are related, you will remain unrelated, because
relationship exists between two. The two will be there. So relationship
is only a facade to hide the duality.</p><p>For moments you delude yourself that you are related, but again you
are. You have fallen back to yourself, and there is no relationship.</p><p>For example, when we are in so-called love, we appear to be related.
We create the fallacy of relationship, but in fact, we are just
deceiving ourselves. The two will remain two. However near, the two will
always remain two. Even in a sex communion, they will be two. The
twoness only creates a fallacy of oneness. Oneness can never exist
between two selves. Oneness can only exist between two non-selves.</p><p>So as far as I am concerned, I am not related to the cosmic reality,
not related at all. And by that I do not mean that I am isolated. By
that I mean there is no one who can exist in relationship. As far as the
cosmic reality is concerned, I am one,</p><p>and the cosmic reality is one with me.</p><p>From my side, I am one, but as far as others are concerned, I am not
one from their side.</p><p>They are related. Someone is related as a friend, someone is related
as an enemy, someone is related as a brother, and someone is related as
a disciple. They may be related to me, but I am not related to them. And
the whole happening in me is to make them unrelated. But there cannot be
any effort on their part, That only can be a realization of no-self.</p><p>If they know that there is no one who can be a disciple and no one
who can be a guru, if they know that there is no one who can be related
to anyone, only then the self falls and your emptiness is naked. And
there are no clothes which give you a boundary, a self. In your total
nakedness, when you know that there is no self, you are but a space, an
inner sky, emptiness -- then you become one. Or I may say then you
really become related.</p><p>When oneness happens, then one's self is not.</p><p>You have asked me how I am related to the cosmos and to the people.
To me they are not two things -- the cosmos and the people. The cosmic
happens in so many ways, and one of the ways is the people. The cosmic
happens in so many ways -- the sun, the stars, the earth, the trees, the
animals, the people. Only frequencies differ, the divinity is the
same.</p><p>So to me, the cosmos and the people are not two things.</p><p>Whatever I have said before is not from thinking. It is a fact. But
if I think -- and I have to think if I am to understand your side --
then you are related to me because you are and as long as you are, you
will be related. That creates a very difficult situation. Daily, moment
to moment, it creates a difficult situation.</p><p>You feel yourself related to me. You feel that you belong to me. Then
you begin to expect that I should belong to you. Because you feel that
you are related to me, you begin to expect that I should be related to
you. Because of that expectation, I know that you are bound to be
frustrated. With a person who is a self, it is bound to be frustrating,
but it may take a longer time. But if you are with a person who is a
no-self, it will not take even a short time gap. Every moment will be
frustrating because there will be no fulfillment of your</p><p>expectations. There is no one to fulfil them.</p><p>So I am very irresponsible, because there is no one who can be
responsible. There are responses but no one who is responsible, so each
response, therefore, is atomic. It cannot be a sequence, so you cannot
expect anything from the moment that will follow. I even do not know.
The response is going to be atomic, each complete in itself, not in any
way related with the past or with the future.</p><p>The ego is a series of events, happenings, and memories. It is so
because you exist in a series -- and you try to take me as a series, but
that becomes difficult. So everyone will feel, sometime or other, angry
with me, because my response is atomic and not a serial one. The serial
response becomes responsibility. Then you can rely.</p><p>I am very unreliable. You can never rely on me -- I myself cannot
rely on me. I do not know what is going to happen. I am completely open
and accepting to anything that happens. And I never think in terms of
relationship, I cannot think; rather, I live in terms of oneness.</p><p>Whenever you are near me, it does not mean that I am related to you.
It is that I become one with you. And this oneness you interpret as
love. But this oneness is neither love nor hate, because all that is
known as love can change into hatred any moment. But this oneness can
never change into hate. You may be near, you may be far; you may be a
friend, you may be an enemy; it makes no difference. As far as I am
concerned, you may come to me or go from me, it makes no difference.</p><p>Relationship is conditional; oneness is non-conditional. Relationship
is always with conditions. Something changes in the condition, and the
relationship will change.</p><p>Everything is always on a volcano. Every relationship is always in a
wavering state, always in a dying process, always changing. So every
relationship creates fear, because always there is the danger of its
being broken. And the more there is fear, the more you cling, and the
more you cling, the more fear you create.</p><p>But oneness is quite diametrically opposite. Oneness is
unconditional. It exists because no condition, no expectation, no
fulfillment, no future result, is hoped for. It is neither conditioned
by the past nor oriented to the future. It is a momentary, atomic
existence, unrelated with the past, unrelated with the future.</p><p>So I feel oneness with the cosmos and with the people also, and from
the cosmos, the feeling is the same. As I feel one with it, from the
cosmos the feeling is of the oneness.</p><p>Once I was not feeling this, but I now know that the cosmos has
always been in the same feeling towards me.</p><p>Oneness is always flowing, it has always been flowing; there has been
an eternal waiting for the cosmos. Now I feel it towards the cosmos; I
feel it also towards the people. The moment some one feels this oneness
towards me, he becomes a part of the cosmic. He is then not a person, he
becomes cosmic. And once you feel oneness, even with one person, you
have known the taste. You have known the taste of ecstasy. Then you can
jump into the all.</p><p>So this is what is happening around me. I do not say I am doing --
this is happening around me.</p><p>I will call you near just to give you a taste of oneness, and if you
can realize this even for a single moment, then you will never be the
same again. This is a very patient effort --</p><p>very unknown, unpredictable. No one can say when the moment is near.
Sometimes your mind is so tuned that you can feel the oneness. That is
why I insist on meditation, because it is nothing but tuning the mind to
such a peak that you can jump into the oneness.</p><p>Meditation to me means tuning of the mind toward oneness, opening of
the mind toward oneness. This can only happen when your meditation has
gone beyond you; otherwise it can never happen. If it is below you --
you are doing it, you are the controller -- then it cannot happen,
because you are the disease. So I persuade you toward meditation in
which, beyond certain limits, you will not be. Meditation will take you
over. By and by you will be pushed. Of course you will begin the
meditation, because there can be no other way. You will have to begin,
but you will not end the meditation. You will begin, but you will not
end it. In between, somewhere the happening will happen. The meditation
will catch hold of you. You will be thrown, and meditation will come in.
Then you will be tuned to the cosmos. Then you will be one.</p><p>Oneness is important, not relationship. Relationship is sansar, the
world, and because of relationship we have to be born again and again.
Once you have</p><p>known oneness, then there is no birth, then there is no death. Then
there is no one except you. All are included.</p><p>You have become the cosmic. The individual must go before the oneness
comes. The ego must go before the divine comes.</p><p>Ego is the source of all relationship. The world is the relationship.
God is not a relationship, the divine is not a relationship. The divine
is not selfness. This means you cannot become one with it. So a bhakta,
a devotee, can never reach the cosmic, because he thinks in terms of
relationship -- God the father, God the lover, God the beloved. He
thinks in terms of relationship. He goes on thinking in terms of self
and the other. He can never transcend the ego. This is something very
subtle, because the devotee is always struggling to surrender. Devotion,
the path of devotion, is the path of surrender. He is trying to
surrender, but to someone.</p><p>If you try to surrender to someone, the other is there. And the other
cannot exist if you are not; so you will go on existing in the shadows.
You will forget yourself, but forgetting yourself is not surrender. You
remember the divine so much that you cannot remember yourself now, but
you are in the back, you exist in the shadows. Otherwise God cannot
exist as the other.</p><p>So the path of devotion, as it exists, cannot lead you to the
transcendental, to the cosmic, to the one. To me, it is not a question
of surrendering to someone, it is just a question of surrendering the
self -- not at someone's feet, just surrendering yourself. If there is
no self, then you have become one.</p><p>The self can go on creating the seeds, it can go on creating the
deception. And the greatest and most certain deception is that of the
devotee and God -- a religious deception. Any deception which becomes
religious can be dangerous, because you cannot even deny it. Even to
deny it will create guilt. You will feel guilty to deny selfhood to the
divine, but to the divine the selfhood is the projection of your self.
The moment you are not a self, there is no self as far as God is
concerned. The whole existence has become selfless. And when the whole
existence has become selfless, then you are one with it.</p><p>Selflessness is the path. Selflessness is the real devotion.</p><p>Selflessness is the authentic surrender.</p><p>So the problem is always of the self. Even if we think of liberation,
moksha, we think of freedom of the self, not freedom from the self. We
think that then we will be free. But then you cannot be free -- moksha
is not the freedom of the self, it is freedom from the self. So I exist
in a selflessness, in a flux, in a process of selflessness. Neither am I
a self nor is anyone else a self.</p><p>For example, waves are in the ocean, but each wave misconceives
itself as separate from the ocean. It appears to be separate. It can
deceive itself -- there are so many waves around, and each wave appears
different. My wave is higher and yours will be lower, or my wave will be
lower and yours higher. How can it be the same? And waves cannot look
deep down in the sea. Only the surface is known. Your wave is dying, and
my wave is young and rising. Your wave has reached the shore, and I am
far off. How can I think that we are both the same? But yet, whether we
think so or not, we are the same.</p><p>So the wave that is known as "me" is not an ego; it is not a self.
This wave has known that the ocean is the wave. The wave is just a
surface phenomenon. A surface is an appearance, a surface is a movement.
This wave that I call "I" has not known that wavelessness, the waveless
ocean, is the real. Even your wave is not different.</p><p>I have known that which joins all. You may call it self-realization,
I will not. I will call it no-self realization, because this is the
essence of all realizations. This is no-selfness. I think you understand
what I mean.</p><p>Whatsoever I said may not be what I mean, and what I mean may not be
what I said. So do not confuse my sayings with my meanings, but always
look into the deep. Always listen to that which has not been said, but
indicated. There are things which cannot be said, but shown, indicated.
All that is deep, and all that is ultimate, can only be shown and never
said. And I am saying things which cannot be said. So do not think of my
words. Always throw the words as meaningless; then go deep down to the
wordless meaning, to the silent meaning. It is always there behind the
word.</p><p>The words are always dead, the meaning is always living. One can be
open to the words, but one can never be open through the intellectual
understanding. You can be open with your total being, not with only your
intellect. It is not that the</p><p>intellect sometimes misunderstands -- the intellect always
misunderstands. It is not that the intellect sometimes errs -- the
intellect is the error. It always errs.</p><p>So whatsoever is being said, be sympathetic with it. Do not try to
understand it, let it go deep in you. Be vulnerable, open to it. Let it
go deep into the heart. Do not create intellectual barriers to it. Then
with your full being in participation, you will know. You may not
understand, but you will know. And understanding is not enough, knowing
is needed. Sometimes you understand or think that you have understood,
thus you create a barrier to the knowing. The intellect understands; the
being knows. The intellect is just a part, it is your being that is the
real.</p><p>When you know, you know with your blood, you know with your bones,
you know with your heartbeats. But if you understand, you understand
only with the mechanism of the mind, which is not so deep. It is only a
device, a utilitarian device which is needed to survive, which is needed
to be related, but which becomes a barrier toward oneness and toward
spiritual death and resurrection. It is only a natural device to
survive. It is not meant to reveal the ultimate truth. It is not meant
to know the hidden mysteries -- and the mysteries are hidden.</p><p>So whatsoever I am saying, do not think about it. Go home and sleep
over it. Just let it go in, let it penetrate. Do not guard yourself; be
open. Each guarding is against knowing.</p><p>And only when it has reached your innermost being will it be known
and really understood. That is what is meant by shraddha, faith. It does
not mean belief. Belief is intellectual. One can believe intellectually,
one can disbelieve intellectually -- both are intellectual. Faith is not
intellectual at all. It is the total mystic participation. It is being
one with the hidden mysteries. It is a jump.</p><p>So whatsoever I am saying, I am not interested in any theory at all,
I am not interested in any philosophies at all. I am interested in the
existential jump. When I say something, it is only to lead you to that
which cannot be said. And when I use words I use them only to lead you
toward silence. When I assert something, it is only to indicate the
unassertable.</p><p>My expression is not really to express something, but to indicate the
inexpressible.</p><p>So be sympathetic, because only sympathy can be the opening. Let
whatever I</p><p>said drop into you; it will have a flowering. If the seed goes into
the depths, it will have its flowering. When the flower comes, you will
know that which has been said, but could not be said. You will know that
which has been said, but yet remains unsaid.</p><p>I Am the Gate Chapter #2</p><p>Chapter title: Neo-sannyas: The answer to human crisis 16 April 1971
am in Bombay, India</p><p>Archive code:</p><p>7104160</p><p>ShortTitle:</p><p>GATE02</p><p>Audio:</p><p>Yes Video: No Question 1</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHY DO YOU GIVE SANNYAS TO ALMOST ANYBODY WHO COMES TO SEE</p><p>YOU?</p><p>WHAT IS YOUR CONCEPT OF SANNYAS? WHAT OBLIGATION DOES IT INVOLVE?</p><p>To me, sannyas is not something very serious. Life itself is not very
serious, and one who is serious is always dead.</p><p>Life is just an overflowing energy without any purpose, and to me
sannyas is to lead life purposelessly. Live life as a play and not as
work. The so-called serious mind, which is diseased, will in fact
convert play into work. The sannyasins are to do the very opposite
--</p><p>to convert work into play. If you can take this whole life just as a
dream, a dream act, then you are a sannyasin. One who considers life as
a dream, a dream- drama, has renounced.</p><p>Renunciation is not leaving the world, but changing the attitude. An
attitude of changing the world is something serious. That is why I can
initiate anyone into sannyas. To me, initiation itself is a play. I will
not ask for any qualification, whether you are qualified or not, because
qualifications are asked where something serious is done. So everyone,
by just being in existence, is qualified enough to be at play. He can
play, and even if he is unqualified it makes no difference, because the
whole thing is just a play. That is why I will not ask for any
qualifications.</p><p>And my sannyas does not involve any obligation either -- the moment
you are a sannyasin, you are totally at freedom. It means now you have
taken a decision, and this is the last decision. Now you have not to
take any decision anymore. You have taken the last decision now -- to
live in indecision, to live in freedom.</p><p>One who lives decidedly can never be free. He is always bound by the
past, because the decision was taken in the past. You can never take any
decision for the future, because the future is unknown and whatever
decision is taken is bound up with the past. The moment you are
initiated into sannyas, you are initiated into an uncharted, unplanned
future. Now you are not tethered by the past. You will be free to live.
That means to act, to play, and to be whatever happens to you. This is
insecurity.</p><p>To renounce a name, to renounce a property, is not really insecurity,
it is very superficial insecurity. And the mind remains the same, the
mind that was thinking about the property as security. Even property is
no security at all, you will die with all your property. Even a home is
not security at all, you will die in it. So the false notion that
property, home, friends and family are securities is</p><p>still prevailing in the mind which thinks, "I have renounced; now I
am insecure."</p><p>Only that mind, only that person lives in insecurity who lives
untethered to the past.</p><p>Insecurity means untethered to the past; and it has so many meanings,
because all that you know comes from the past. Even your mind is of the
past.</p><p>So one who renounces knowledge is really renouncing something. You
yourself come from the past, you are nothing but accumulated
experiences. So one who renounces himself is renouncing something. All
your desires and all your hopes and all your expectations -- they all
confirm the past. One who renounces his past renounces his desires, his
hopes, his expectations.</p><p>Now you will be just like an emptiness, a nothingness, a nobody.
Sannyas means throwing all claims of being somebody. Now you are going
into no-identity, nobodiness.</p><p>So this is the last decision of your mind, with which the past is
closed. The identity is broken, the continuity is not there. You are
new; you are reborn.</p><p>Everyone who is alive is qualified to live in insecurity. If one is
really to live, one has to live in insecurity. Every arrangement of
security is renounced living. The more you are secure, the less you are
living. The more you are dead, the more secure, and vice versa also. For
example, a dead man cannot die again, he is death-proof. A dead man
cannot be ill, so he is disease-proof. A dead man is so secure that
those who go on living may seem foolish to him -- they live in
insecurity.</p><p>If you are alive at all, then you are insecure. The more insecure,
the more alive. So a sannyasin to me is a person who decides to live to
the utmost, to the optimum, to the maximum; it is just like a flame
burning from both poles.</p><p>There is no obligation, there is no commitment. You are not bound to
any discipline at all. If you want to call insecurity a discipline, that
is another matter. Of course, it is an inner discipline. You are not
going to be anarchic, no! When have I ever said that the person will be
anarchic? Anarchy is always bound up with order, with a system. If you
renounce order, you can never be disorderly. It is not denying order, it
is just renouncing, and renouncing means now to be in order! It is just
an act, a play for others' sake. You will not be serious about it,
it</p><p>is just a role of the game. You walk to the left or to the right for
others' sake, for traffic's sake, but there is no seriousness about it;
nothing is serious in it.</p><p>So the sannyasin is not going to be disorderly. As far as he himself
is concerned, as far as his inner consciousness is concerned, now there
will be no order. That does not mean there will be disorder, because the
disorder is always a part of the order. When there is order, there is a
possibility of disorder. When there is no order, then there is no
disorder, because there is spontaneity. Moment to moment you live,
moment to moment you act.</p><p>Each moment is complete in itself. You do not decide for it. You have
no decision how to act. The moment comes to you, and you act. There is
no pre- determination, there is no pre-plan.</p><p>The moment comes to you. You happen to the moment, and whatever comes
out, let it come. More and more you will feel a new discipline arising
in you -- a moment-tomoment discipline. It is a very different
dimension, so it will be better to understand it clearly. When you
decide beforehand what to do, it is because you do not think you are
conscious enough to act in the moment, spontaneously. You are not
self-confident; that is why you decide beforehand.</p><p>And still you are deciding. You cannot act in the moment, so how can
you decide beforehand? Now you are less experienced. You will be more
experienced when the moment comes. If I cannot believe in the "me" of
tomorrow, how can I believe in the</p><p>"me" of today? And when I have to decide it beforehand, it carries no
meaning. It will only be destructive.</p><p>I decide today, and I act tomorrow. All has changed. Everything is
new, and the decision is old. And if I do not act according to the
moment, there is guilt. So all those who teach deciding beforehand,
create guilt. I do not act, then I feel guilty. And if I act, then I
cannot act adequately, and frustration is bound to follow.</p><p>So I say you have not to commit yourself to any decision, and you
will be free. Let each act, each moment, come to you, and let your total
being decide... in that moment. Let the decision come as the act
happens. Never let it precede the act, then the act can never be
total.</p><p>One should know that when you decide beforehand you decide
intellectually.</p><p>Your total being can never be in it, because the moment has not come.
If I love someone, and I decide that when I meet him or her I will act
this way, I will say this thing, I will do this and will not do that,
this can only be intellectual, mental. This can never be total, because
the moment has not arrived. The total being has not been challenged, so
how can the total being act?</p><p>And when I have decided beforehand and the moment comes, the total
being will not be able to act because the decision will be there. So I
will only imitate, follow, copy, the preceding. I will be the false man.
I will not be real because I will not be total. I will have a blueprint
to act; I will act according to it. Again this will be a mental act, not
with your total being. So either you succeed or you fail, yet in both
cases you have failed because the total being could not be in it. You
will not feel love.</p><p>So let the moment come, let the moment challenge you, and let your
total being act. Then the act is total. Then your total being comes to
act. Then you are totally in it! And the best that is possible will come
out of this totalness and never out of the decisions. So sannyas means
living moment to moment with no commitments of the past.</p><p>If I give you a mala and if I give you a robe, this is only for your
remembrance, that now you have not to decide. It is only to make you
remember that you are not the old. When this awareness becomes so deep
that you do not need to remember it, then throw the robe, then throw the
mala. If it comes to you to throw it, do not make it a decision, do not
make it a commitment to me. If it comes to you, then throw them, but not
unless the awareness has become so deep that even in sleep you know that
you are a sannyasin.</p><p>When even in your dream this ocher robe has come, then throw it. When
even in your dream this ocher robe is there, then throw it. Then it is
meaningless. If even unconsciously you remember, if you cannot forget
even in any situation, then there is no need. So this is just a device
to help you toward total being, to help you toward total action.</p><p>And I will go on conferring sannyas on each and everybody who happens
to be with me even for a single moment because, as I have said, I do not
know about tomorrow at all.</p><p>So I cannot wait. If you come this moment, whatever is to be done is
to be done.</p><p>This moment I cannot wait. I do not know about tomorrow, about what
is going to happen, and I cannot plan. So the moment you are with me,
whatever is being done is to be done this very moment. It cannot be
postponed, because there is no future for me.</p><p>And this sannyas is not the old sannyas. It is totally a new concept,
or totally an ancient one which has been forgotten completely -- you can
call it either. It is the newest and the oldest, simultaneously, because
whenever there has been sannyas, really, it has been such. But always
there are imitators, and you cannot deny them -- they are. There are
imitators, and there will always be. And they make everything a
discipline, because only a discipline can be imitated.</p><p>Sannyas is something that cannot be imitated. Freedom cannot be
imitated, thus sannyas can never be imitated. But those who are
imitators, what can they do? They will make a system out of this --
imitators always create systems. Anything other than sannyas they do not
destroy so much, because life as it is lived is imitation. Imitation
goes on, the whole world is imitating. Your whole upbringing is through
imitation -- in language, in morality, in society, in culture,
everything is through imitation. Everything is imbibed through
imitation.</p><p>So imitations are successful everywhere except in sannyas. They
destroy much here.</p><p>They cannot destroy anywhere else because everywhere imitation is the
rule. You cannot be free with language, you must imitate it. You cannot
be free with social structure, you must imitate it. Imitators succeed
everywhere. Only in sannyas the dimension of total freedom is something
with which imitators grow very destructive, because its very dimension
is quite opposite. Imitation will destroy it. So Jesus is imitated, you
have the IMITATION OF CHRIST. Whenever sannyas is imitated there is no
sannyas left. So when I say there is no commitment, I mean there will be
no imitation.</p><p>You are totally free, I will throw you into an openness. That is what
is meant by initiation. It is not narrowing you down, it is giving you
an open sky. It is just pushing you to fly in an open sky. Of course
there are no routes and no road maps, there cannot be. And there cannot
be any road in the sky. So you have to fly alone, you have to depend on
yourself alone. Your existence will be the sole company -- the only
company.</p><p>Life is just like a sky. It is not like earth roads, you cannot
follow; following is impossible. You have to be alone. Initiation means
that now I push you into aloneness. So now you are alone totally, not
depending on anyone, not even me. It requires courage. To imitate is
easy, to follow is so easy, to depend on someone is easy. But to be
totally alone with no map, with no discipline, with no system, is the
greatest courage. And a sannyasin means one who is courageous. This
courage is not something which can be imitated, it has to be developed
through living.</p><p>You will err, you will go astray. That is all implied in it. But by
erring you will learn, and by going astray you will come to the right.
And there is no other way. You have to pass through arduousness. This
walking alone, this flying alone... one has to pass through all this
austerity. And this sannyas is different in another sense also, because
the old sannyas, the so-called sannyas which is prominent, is less a
spiritual renunciation and more a social renunciation. Even the social
structure of it is more physiological, less spiritual.</p><p>This sannyas is basically spiritual. So you can receive it anywhere,
wherever you are. It demands involvement -- inner, deeper, spiritual.
And as I see it, the more you are involved physiologically, the less
there is a possibility to go deep, because once involved with the
physiological you will never be out of it. You will never be out of it
because there are intrinsic impossibilities: if someone is trying to be
above desires he is struggling for something which is impossible,
because desires are natural. Your body cannot exist without them. So you
will go on clinging to the body, and still desires will be there --</p><p>less, of course, but they will be there. And the weaker the body, the
less the desires will be strongly felt. So you can go on weakening, but
unless you die the body will have desires.</p><p>There are not only desires, there are needs. Needs are to be
fulfilled, and the better fulfilled, the less they trouble you, the less
they demand, the less time is needed for them.</p><p>So once you are struggling with physiological needs, you will waste
your whole life. This whole process, this whole old sannyas, is
negative, fighting against something. Of course, it is
ego-strengthening. Whenever there is fight, ego is strengthened. If you
can kill a desire, you may become more egoistic. If you can deny your
body a particular need, you become more egoistic. Fight, in any</p><p>manner, is always ego-satisfying and ego-fulfilling.</p><p>To me, sannyas is something positive, not negative. It is not to deny
your bodily needs. It is not to deny your superficial needs it is to
develop, to grow in your inwardness. It is not fighting against
something, it is giving all your energies toward growing something. Your
being must grow and must become mature. The more your being grows, the
less you will be your ego. And once your being has grown, you know what
is need and what is desire.</p><p>Otherwise you can never know; you can never make a distinction
between what is a need and what is a desire.</p><p>Desire is always mad, need is always sensible. If you deny your
needs, you are suicidal.</p><p>If you go on increasing your desires, again you are suicidal. If you
go on denying your needs, you are committing suicide. If you go on
increasing your desires, then again you are committing suicide, in a
different way.</p><p>If desires become too much, if desires are so overwhelmingly great,
you will become mad. The tension will be unbearable. If you deny your
needs, again you create tensions that will become unbearable. So there
are two types of suicidal minds: one which goes on denying its needs,
and one which goes on transforming its needs into desires. And this
distinction can never be made outwardly. No one else can decide for you
what is the desire and what is the need. Your own awareness will be the
measure, because to one, something maybe a need and to another it may be
a desire. So no ready-made answer can be given.</p><p>Only this much can be said: that without which you cannot exist is
the minimum definition of need. But one's own awareness will decide,
ultimately, and that too cannot be decided forever because today
something may be a need, tomorrow it may be a desire.</p><p>This moment it is a need, and that moment it may be a desire. But
once there is positive awareness in you, you are aware of your mind and
its cunning and shattering ways; once you are aware of your ego, its
methods of strengthening itself, its methods of feeding itself, you will
know the distinction.</p><p>So I am not negative. Sannyas, neo-sannyas, is absolutely positive.
It is to grow</p><p>something in you. I am to give you a positive attitude toward your
being, not a negative attitude. You are not to deny anything. Of course,
many things may be denied -- not by you, but automatically. As you go
more inward, you will shrink outwardly. The less one is a being
inwardly, the more he has to substitute himself outwardly. He will go on
spreading.</p><p>But do not struggle with your spreading, outward self. Struggle with
the seed which is you, which can grow to such heights that this outward
nonsense will automatically fall down. Once you know the inner riches,
then there is nothing which is comparable from the outside world. Once
you know the inner bliss, then enjoyment is foolish, then all that goes
on in the name of entertainment is foolish, stupid. It just falls down
once you know the inner ecstasy. Then all that is known as happiness,
joy, is nothing but deception. But not before -- unless you have known
the inner happiness you cannot say that, and if you say that then you
will be in a greater deception.</p><p>So a positive attitude toward sannyas means a dimension altogether
different. You can be where you are, you can go on doing whatever you
are doing -- no outward change is immediately asked for. Of course there
will be changes, but they will come. When they come, let them come, but
do not try, do not make any effort. Do not force them to come.</p><p>And I see more possibility for positive sannyas, for positive
renunciation, in the world that is coming.</p><p>That negative concept of denying oneself was possible previously for
so many reasons.</p><p>One was the way society was structured. All the agricultural
societies could allow some persons to be completely without work. But
the more the society is industrialized, the less will be the possibility
of joint families. The more individuality, the less will be the
possibility of joint families. Loose economic structure could allow more
joint families, but the more planned the economy, the less will be the
possibility of joint families. Those who were sadhus and monks seem to
be exploiters. Now they cannot be respected, now they cannot exist. And
as I see it, everyone must do whatever he can do; one must contribute to
the society in which one exists. One should not remain an exploiter. One
should not be, and the religious person cannot be, an exploiter. And if
a religious person can exploit, then we cannot expect others not to
exploit.</p><p>To me, a sannyasin will not be an exploiter. He will earn a living.
He will be a producer, not only a consumer. So a productive concept also
goes with the positive. The old concept of the non-productive monks was
well adjusted with the negative attitude. The positive attitude will
have more implications. For example, the old concept of sannyas denied
many things. It denied a family, it denied sex, denied love. It denied
everything that contributes to society's happiness -- that can
contribute to your own happiness. It denied -- I will not deny.</p><p>That does not mean that I allow. When I say I will not deny, it only
means a moment can come when a person becomes absolutely transcendental
-- for example, to sex. That is another thing, that is not a requirement
but a consequence. It is not needed before sannyas, it will come after
sannyas. And I will not make it a guilt if it does not come. The old
concept is very cruel, it was sadistic and masochistic both. Sex was
denied because sex seems to give a glimpse of happiness.</p><p>So many religions allowed sex without happiness. You can just use it
for reproduction, but you should not have any happiness out of it. Only
then it is not a sin. So sex is not really a sin. "But you should not be
happy. To be happy is a sin." To me everything that is given to human
beings is not to be denied; it is not to be suppressed. Let the inner
flowering come first -- then you will see that so many energy channels
have changed their course. And the difference will be great.</p><p>If you deny sex, then you have to deny love also. Those sannyasins
who deny, will become loveless. They talk about love but they become
loveless. They talk about</p><p>"universal love." It is always easier to talk about universal love
than to love a single individual -- that is more arduous, to love the
whole universe is so easy; nothing is involved. And one who thinks in
terms of denial will talk of universal love and will go on denying and
uprooting individual feelings.</p><p>Religion that denies sex will have to deny love, because with love
there is every possibility that sex may follow. But as I see it, if sex
is not denied but transformed with your positive growth, then there is
no need to deny love. You can be loving. And unless you are loving, the
energy that may come to you that is not going through the sex channel
cannot be used. It will become destructive.</p><p>So to me a growing love is the only possibility of transcending
sex.</p><p>Love must grow. It must go up to the universe, but it must not begin
from there, it is never from the far. And one who thinks that one should
begin from the far is deceiving himself. Every journey has to begin from
the near. The first step that is to be taken cannot be taken from the
far. One should be a loving individual. And the more one's love grows
deep, the less he becomes sexual and the more love will spread.</p><p>So I will not deny anything, because ultimately bliss is to be
sought. Everyone is seeking bliss. Happiness is not to be denied, but
when there is an explosion of bliss you will know that whatever you have
been thinking as happiness was fake. But you cannot throw it at this
moment. Let the bliss come first. That is what is meant by positive
growth. Let something come in you, something greater, only then the
lesser will be thrown. And your ego will not be strengthened by it
because when you throw it, you throw something useless, worthless.</p><p>All those who claim renunciation say they left this and that. They
show by this that nothing great has been achieved. Whatever they have
renounced yet remains meaningful.</p><p>It is there in their memory, it is still a part of the mind, they are
still the owners. Of course they have renounced, but how can one
renounce something which one does not own? So if you go on thinking
about renunciation, you are still owning. In a negative way you are the
owner.</p><p>But once you know a greater phenomenon -- a greater bliss, a greater
happiness -</p><p>- then you are not renouncing things. They just drop away, just like
dry leaves from the tree. No one knows and no one hears, the dry leaves
just drop. The tree remains oblivious to it and there is no wound left
behind. So, to me, everything has a moment to happen, a moment of
ripeness -- ripeness is all. One must ripen; otherwise one will be
wandering unnecessarily and harassing himself unnecessarily and
destroying himself unnecessarily.</p><p>One should ripen, then the opportunity comes by itself.</p><p>So renunciation is through positive growth. That is what I mean by my
sannyas -</p><p>-</p><p>renunciation through positive growth. There is no negativity at all,
no denial, no</p><p>suppression.</p><p>I accept the human being as he is. Of course, now much is potential,
but as he is, he is not to be condemned. There is nothing to be
condemned. He is the seed, and if you condemn the seed, how can you
acclaim the tree? I accept the human being as he is -- totally, with no
denial at all. Only I do not say that this is all he can be, that this
is the end. I only say that this is the beginning. The human being is
only a seed which can grow into a great tree, which can grow into
divinity. Each human being can be a god. But now, as he is, he is only a
seed. The seed is to be protected, the seed is to be loved, and the seed
is to be given every opportunity to grow.</p><p>Sannyas means that you have come to realize that you are a seed, a
potentiality. This is not the end. This is only the beginning, and now
you must decide to go into that growth.</p><p>That growth comes through freedom, that growth comes through
insecurity. You see a seed -- very secure. A tree is not so secure. The
seed is closed, closed completely. The moment the seed dies and the tree
begins to grow, the potentiality begins to be activated.</p><p>There are dangers -- insecurity will be there, there will be every
possibility of destruction, a very delicate thing fighting against the
whole universe. But now you are only a seed, there is no danger.</p><p>To be a sannyasin means now you take the decision to grow. And this
is the last decision.</p><p>Now you will have to struggle, now you will have insecurity, you will
have dangers, and you will have to fight and face them moment to moment.
This moment-to-moment fight and struggle, this fighting into the
unknown, this fight for the unknown, this living in the unknown, is the
real renunciation.</p><p>To decide to grow is a great renunciation -- a renunciation of the
security that is given to the seed, a renunciation of the wholeness that
is given to the seed. But this security is at a very great cost. The
seed is dead, it is only potentially living. It can live, or it can
remain dead. Unless it grows, becomes a tree, it is dead. And as far as
I know, human beings, unless they decide to grow, unless they take a
jump into the unknown, are like seeds --</p><p>dead, closed.</p><p>To be a sannyasin is to take a decision to grow, to take a decision
to go into dangers, to take a decision to live in indecision. This seems
paradoxical. It is not. One has to begin somewhere, and even to live
indecisively one has to have a decision somewhere. Even to go into
insecurity is going somewhere, and one has to decide it. I help your
decision and create a situation in which you can make a decision. This
neo-sannyas can go to the very core of the world. It can reach to
everyone because nothing special is needed -- only understanding.</p><p>Another thing I would like to explain is that this sannyas is not
bound to any religion. On this earth every type of sannyas has been part
and parcel of a particular religion, a particular sect. That too is is a
part of a security measure. You renounce, yet you belong.</p><p>You say, "I have left the society," yet you belong to the sect. You
go on being a Hindu, a Moslem or a Sikh. You go on being something.</p><p>Really, sannyas means to be religious and not to be bound to any
religion. Again, it is a great jump into the unknown. Religions are
known, but religion is the unknown. A sect has systems, religion has no
system. A sect has scriptures; religion has only existence, no
scriptures. This sannyas is existential, religious, nonsectarian.</p><p>That does not mean that this sannyas will deny a Mohammedan
Mohammedanism, that this sannyas will deny a Christian Christianity --
no! It means, really, quite the reverse. It means it will give the
Christians the real Christianity. It will give the Hindu the real
Hinduism, because the deeper you go into the Hindu religion, ultimately
the Hinduism will drop and you will find religiousness only. The deeper
you go into Christianity, the less it will be like Christianity and the
more like religion. At once, you reach to the center of the
religion.</p><p>So when I say by becoming a sannyasin you belong to no religion as
such, I do not mean that you are denying Christianity or Hinduism or
Jainism. You are only denying the dead part that has become burdensome
in religion. You are only denying the dead tradition, and you are
uncovering and discovering again the living current, the living current
behind all the dead -- dead traditions, dead scriptures, dead gurudoms,
dead churches.</p><p>You are again finding the living current. It is always there but it
is always to be rediscovered; each one has to discover it again. It
cannot be transferred, it cannot be transmitted. No one can give it to
you. Whatever has been given will be dead. You will have to dig it deep
within yourself, otherwise you never find it. So I am not giving you a
religion, I am giving you only the push to find the living current. It
will be your own finding, and it can never be anyone else's. So I am not
transmitting anything to you.</p><p>There is a parable.â¦</p><p>Buddha comes one day with a flower in his hand. He is to give a
sermon, but he remains silent. Those who have come to listen to him
begin to wonder what he is doing. Time is passing. It has never happened
like this -- what is he doing? They wonder whether he is going to speak
or not. Then someone asks, "What are you doing? Have you forgotten that
we have come to listen to you?"</p><p>Buddha says, "I have communicated something. I have communicated
something which cannot be communicated through words. Have you heard it
or not?"</p><p>No one has heard it. But one disciple -- a very unknown disciple,
known here for the first time, a bhikkhu named Mahakashyapa -- laughs
heartily. Buddha says, "Mahakashyapa, come to me. I give you this
flower, and I declare that all that could be given through words I have
given to you all. That which is really meaningful, which cannot be given
through words, I give to Mahakashyapa."</p><p>So Zen tradition has been asking again and again, "But what was
transmitted to Mahakashyap?" -- a transmission without words. What has
Buddha said? What has Mahakashyapa heard? And whenever there is someone
who knows, he laughs again, and the story remains a mystery. When
someone understands, he laughs again. Wherever there are persons who are
scholars, who know much and who know nothing, they will discuss what has
been told, they will decide about what has been heard. But someone who
knows will laugh.</p><p>Bankei, a great Zen teacher, said, "Buddha said nothing. Mahakashyapa
heard nothing."</p><p>So someone asks, "Buddha said nothing?"</p><p>"Yes," Bankei said. "Yes, nothing was said; nothing was heard. It was
said, and it</p><p>was heard. I am a witness."</p><p>So someone said, "You were not there."</p><p>So Bankei said, "I need not have been there. When nothing was
communicated, no one is needed to be a witness. I was not there, and yet
I am a witness." Someone laughed, and Bankei said, "He was also a
witness."</p><p>The living current cannot be communicated. It is always there, but
you have to go to it. It is nearby, just by the corner. It is in you,
you are the living current. But you have never been in. Your attention
has always been out, you have been out-oriented. You have become fixed.
Your focus has become deadly fixed, so you cannot conceive of what it
means to be in. Even when you try to be in, you just close your eyes and
go on being out.</p><p>To be in means to be in a state of mind where there is no out and
where there is no in. To be in means there is no boundary between you
and the all. When there is nothing out, only then you come to the inner
current. And once you have a glimpse, you are transformed. You know
something which is incomprehensible, you know something which intellect
cannot comprehend, you know something which intellect cannot
communicate.</p><p>But yet one has to communicate -- even with a flower, even with a
laugh. It makes no difference, they are gestures. Does it make any
difference if I use my lips or if I use my hands with a flower? Just the
gesture is new, so it disturbs you. Otherwise, it is as much a gesture
as any lip moving. I make a sound, it is a gesture. I remain silent, it
is a gesture.</p><p>But the gesture is new, unknown to you, so you think something is
different. Nothing is different. The living current cannot be
communicated, yet has to be communicated --</p><p>somehow has to be indicated, somehow has to be shown.</p><p>So the moment someone becomes ready to take sannyas, it is a decision
for him toward a great search, and it is a gesture to me that he is
ready to take a jump. And when someone is ready to change, to lose an
old identity, to be reborn into a new being... When someone is ready, he
need not be qualified; it makes no difference. This readiness is the
qualification. When someone is ready, I am ready to push. It is not
necessary that he should reach, but is it not a wonder that</p><p>he should begin?</p><p>That is not the point -- that he should reach is not the point at
all. But one begins. This beginning is something which is great.
Reaching is not so great. Beginning is great because whenever someone
reaches, he is capable. And whenever someone begins, he is not capable.
You understand me? Whenever someone begins, he is incapable. So the
beginning is the miracle.</p><p>A Buddha is not a miracle. He is capable, so he reaches. It is so
mathematical, there is no miracle. But when someone comes to me with all
his desires, with all his longings, with all his limitations and thinks
to begin, it is a miracle. And when I have to choose between Buddha and
him, I will choose him. He is a miracle, so incapable and so
courageous.</p><p>So I am not concerned at all with what end you achieve. I am only
concerned with the beginning. You begin, and I know once there is the
beginning, the end is half in hand.</p><p>The beginning is the thing. Once there is a beginning, you will go on
growing.</p><p>It is not a question of a day or two days, it is not a question of
time. It may happen at the next moment, it may not happen for many
births, but once you have begun you will not be the same again. This
very decision to take sannyas is such a miracle of change. For births
continuing you may not achieve, but you will not be the same again. This
will come again and recur again.</p><p>This remembrance of taking the decision of freedom will be there
always amidst all your slaveries, amidst all your bondages. This
decision to be free, this longing to be free, this longing to transcend,
will be there waiting for the opportunity. So how can I deny anyone a
beginning? And whom do I have to ask whether he is qualified or not? If
God himself allows you existence, life, and never asks you, "Are you
qualified?" who am I to ask?</p><p>I am not giving you life, I am not giving you existence, I am just
giving you a conversion.</p><p>When God is ready to give you life, you must be qualified with all
your limitations and weaknesses. He allows you to exist. You must be
precious, even in the divine's eyes you must be precious. So who am I to
deny you the beginning? But gurus sometimes become even wiser than God
himself. They</p><p>decide who is qualified and who is not. Even God comes to them --
then they will decide who is qualified and who is not. And whenever
anyone comes, God is coming. So do not laugh: whenever anyone comes, God
is coming, because no one else can come.</p><p>So who am I to deny someone when he comes to me? He may not know it,
he may not be aware of it, but I am aware of it -- that God is in search
of himself. So I cannot deny him, I can just rejoice in his beginning.
That is why no distinction is made, no qualification is required. And
this sannyas is needed at the moment for the whole humanity. The whole
humanity needs it. We have become so unaware of the living current, we
have become so unaware of the divinity within and without, that each one
should be made aware.</p><p>Otherwise, the situation has fallen so low that it may not be
possible to come back for a century. It has been going on and on.</p><p>Darwin thought that we were animals; now they think that we are
automata. Animals have souls at least! They had; now we have not. And
soon we will not be such efficient automata either, because better
computers will be there, better mechanisms will be there; not only will
you be only a machine, but a very ordinary one.</p><p>This is the belief -- this is not knowledge -- this is the belief
which has been forced on the human mind for three centuries. Now it has
become prominent. It is as much a belief as any belief. It makes no
difference that science is in support of it, it is a belief. And once
humanity begins to believe it, it will be difficult to revive human
souls.</p><p>So the days that are coming, the last part of this century, will be
very definitive. The last part of this century will decide the fate for
centuries to come. This is going to be definitive -- definitive in the
sense that the belief that human beings are only machines, natural
mechanical devices, will become prevalent. When this belief is
prevalent, it will be very difficult to come to that lost hidden current
again. It will go on becoming more difficult; even today it has become
so difficult. There are so few people in this world who really know the
living current -- they can be counted on the fingers.</p><p>All those who talk are only talking. Very few people really know, and
each day the number is falling down. Those who know are not being
replaced again. Each</p><p>day there are fewer and fewer people who know the living current, who
know the reality behind, who know consciousness, who know the
divine.</p><p>This century, this last part of the century, will be decisive. So
those who are in any way ready to begin, I will initiate them. If ten
thousand are initiated and even one reaches the goal, the trouble is
worth taking. And all those who come to know something of this inner
world, I would ask them to go and knock at every door, and tell them to
stand on the roofs, and proclaim that something blissful, that something
immortal, that something divine, is.</p><p>Be a witness, go and be a witness to it; otherwise the mechanical
belief will become prevalent. It is easier to check it now, it will not
be easy to replace it afterwards. And the mind is in a way plastic, more
plastic today -- ready to be molded in any mold. Because all the old
beliefs have been taken away, the mind is vacant and thirsty to belong
anywhere -- even to a mechanical belief. Any nonsense which can give you
a feeling of belonging, which can give you a feeling of knowing that you
know what reality is, will be caught. And the human mind will become
tethered to it.</p><p>So not a single moment is to be wasted. Those who know even a bit,
those who have even a glimpse, should talk about it to others. And this
last part of this century is not so small as it seems. It is a big one,
and in a way, bigger even than centuries. Because the speed of change is
so great, these thirty years are just like thirty centuries. What could
not be done in thirty centuries can be done in thirty years, in three
decades. The rapidity of change is such that the time which looks small
is not small.</p><p>There are three beliefs which are going to kill, which are going to
destroy the last bridge between humanity and the divine undercurrent.
One is the belief that mind is just a machine. The second is communism
-- that man and man's relationship to society is just an economic
phenomenon. Then there is no heart, then man is not decisive -- the
economic is decisive. Then man is just in the hands of economic forces,
blind forces.</p><p>Then consciousness is not decisive, but social structure is decisive.
Marx says that it is not consciousness which determines society, but
society which determines consciousness.</p><p>Then consciousness is nothing. If it is not decisive, it is not.</p><p>And thirdly, there is the concept of irrationality. The three are:
the Darwinian concept which has turned into the belief of the human
machine, the Marxist concept which has turned consciousness into an
epiphenomenon of economic forces, and the Freudian concept of
irrationality -- that man is in the hands of natural forces, instinct.
He has to do whatsoever he does, and there is no consciousness but only
an illusory notion that we are conscious.</p><p>In these three concepts the religions are not prevalent. Neither is
Mohammedanism a prevalent religion, nor Christianity nor Hinduism nor
Buddhism. Neither is Buddha a prophet now, nor Mahavira nor Mohammed nor
Christ. Today's prophets are Freud, Darwin and Marx. All these three are
against freedom, and all these three are against immortality.</p><p>So I will go on pushing everyone into the inner world, hoping of
course, hoping against hope, that someone may come to the living
current, the satchitananda, and may be able to express it through his
total being -- to live it. If even a few people can be found to live it
now, the whole course of the humanity that is to come will be changed.
But this can only happen not through teaching, but through living. That
is why I insist on sannyas, it is a beginning to living.</p><p>I insist on it also in another sense. You may say, "If no outward
change is needed, then why change the robe? Why change the name?" I want
sannyas to become infectious. For you, it helps you to remember. For
others, it begins from a point where they can think about it. They can
be for or against it, they cannot be indifferent to it. Your colored
robe, the moment someone sees it, he will either be for it or against
it; no one can be indifferent. He will think about it; if not, he will
laugh about it. He will either think that someone has renounced or he
will think someone has gone mad, but he will begin to think. And if
these robes go on striking, if a person has to come in contact with
these robes daily, so many times, they are going to become infectious.
He cannot continue neglecting it. He will have to decide something about
it.</p><p>I want religion to become a current dialogue. It is not a current
dialogue at all. No one talks about it. Everyone talks about politics;
no one talks about religion. If someone talks about it, others only
tolerate it out of etiquette. They preach, hear or listen only as a
social duty, as a Sunday affair. No one takes any care what is happening
to his innermost soul.</p><p>So religion has to be made a current topic, a current dialogue. Every
means</p><p>should be used, and it should be a living symbol.</p><p>Wherever you go, you create waves of thinking, waves of emotion. Even
by your passing, just your passing, you create a wave, an atmosphere, a
situation. That is why I insist on change. There are other reasons also.
The ocher color helps in so many ways, because each color has its own
wavelength, each color has its own absorption capacity. You cannot be
the same in differently colored robes. You will be different.</p><p>When you are in a white robe, you cannot be the same as when you are
in a black robe.</p><p>With the black you will feel sadness, crippling all around you, in
you. You will become sad unknowingly. In this world, in this existence,
nothing is meaningless, everything carries a meaning. Everything carries
a particular atmosphere with it.</p><p>The ocher color is chosen for so many reasons. One reason is that it
makes you feel just like the sunrise in the morning; it is the color of
the sun rising. The whole atmosphere becomes alive, worth seeing.
Everything becomes alive. The rays that come are ocher colored. They
create a living atmosphere -- something alive and vibrating. So this
color was chosen in order that you might vibrate with divinity. You must
be alive with divinity.</p><p>No sadness shall have any shelter in you, no sorrow should be allowed
to have any shelter.</p><p>You must be in a dancing mood twenty-four hours -- it is the dancing
color. And it conserves the same atmosphere around your body, just like
in the morning. The whole day, it conserves. If you can feel it,
cooperate with it, you will know a great difference.</p><p>And when one is wearing ocher, it is one thing; when thousands wear
it, the result is altogether different. The quantity changes the
quality.</p><p>Buddha will come to a city with ten thousand ocher-colored bhikkhus.
The whole city is surrounded with a new atmosphere, it is a great
attack! The whole day the village is as fresh as in the morning,
everywhere is the ocher color. Each moment, everyone is remembering. The
ocher has a psychological association.</p><p>You know that the policeman, when he is off duty and not wearing his
uniform, is an ordinary person. You will see the change even in his face
-- he is so ordinary. When he is in uniform, he is someone else -- quite
a different person. He is not the same man, his whole behavior will be
different. He will stand in a different way, he will walk in a different
way.</p><p>The ocher color has become associated with sannyas. It was used for
so long, for thousands and thousands of years. It has become a part of
the collective mind. And you should know sannyas is originally an
oriental concept; it dawned first on the oriental mind. For at least ten
thousand years the Orient has used the ocher color. In your so many
lives, the ocher color has been worn as a robe of the sannyasin, It is
part of your collective mind, of your collective unconscious. It is a
great association.</p><p>So once you use it, then the whole ancient collective mind is revived
again. Your memories come up again and surround you. They change your
personality, they change you. They change the inner structure of your
mind. So it is possible to use another color, but it is difficult to
create the same association with it now, and the time is short and the
moment is crucial.</p><p>So many have asked me, why ocher? Why not a new color? A new color
can be used, but it will not be useful. If I had ten thousand years
ahead of me, then I would change the color, but the time is short and
decisive and crucial and a great crisis is to be faced. So I will use
your many births.</p><p>And if you think that when someone comes to me I will just give him
sannyas, it is not so. I may say that I gave sannyas, to anyone who came
to me, but it is not just so. It looks so, but it is not just so. The
moment anyone comes to me, I know much about him that he has not known
about himself even.</p><p>Yesterday, someone came to me in the morning, and I told her to take
sannyas. She was bewildered. She said to give her time to think and
decide, at least two days. I said to her,</p><p>"Who knows about two days? So much you require... take it today, this
moment." But she was not decisive, so I gave her two days. The next
morning she came and took it. She has not taken two days, only one day.
I ask her, "Why? You have been given two days, why have you come so
soon?" She said, "At three o' clock at night, suddenly I was awake, and
something went deep within</p><p>me telling me, `Go take sannyas.'"</p><p>It is not a decision that she has made, but a decision that has been
made by her very deep-rooted mind. But the moment she came in the room I
knew her, I knew that mind which she came to know twenty hours
later.</p><p>So when I say take sannyas, there are so many reasons with every
person to whom I tell it. Either he has been a sannyasin in the last
life, or somewhere in the long journey he has been a sannyasin.</p><p>I had given her another name yesterday, but today I had to change it
because I gave her that name in her indecision. Now I am giving her a
different name that will be a help to her. When she came this morning,
she herself was decided. That other name was not needed at all. And I
have given her the name Ma Yoga Vivek, because now the decision has come
through her vivek -- her awareness, her consciousness.</p><p>Ma Yoga Tao is here, for example. She has been thrice a sannyasin. I
have given her the name Tao because in a past life she was Chinese and a
Taoist monk. She might not know it, but I have given her the name Tao.
Someday she remembers, and then she will know why I have given her a
Chinese name. Now it is irrelevant, but the moment she will remember
that she had been a Taoist monk, she will know why the name was given to
her.</p><p>Everything is meaningful. It may not be so obvious, and it may not be
possible to explain it to you. So many things will remain unexplained
for a much longer time, but the more you become receptive, the more I
will be able to explain. The deeper your capacities to be sympathetic,
the deeper the truth that can be revealed. The more rational the
discussion, the less the truth that can be revealed, because only less
significant truths can be given any proof with reason. Deeper truth
cannot be given any proof with reason.</p><p>So unless I feel that you are so sympathetic that reason will not
come in. I cannot tell you.</p><p>I have to remain silent on so many points -- not because I am
withholding anything from you, but because it will not be helpful to
you, and on the contrary it may prove harmful.</p><p>I Am the Gate</p><p>Chapter #3</p><p>Chapter title: Occult devices and the spiritual search 18 April 1971
am in Bombay, India</p><p>Archive code:</p><p>7104180</p><p>ShortTitle:</p><p>GATE03</p><p>Audio:</p><p>Yes Video: No Question 1</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IN THE LAST SITTING YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE MALA, ABOUT CHANGING</p><p>THE COLOR OF THE CLOTHING, ABOUT CHANGING THE NAME, AND THE</p><p>REASONS FOR THESE THINGS. WHY DO YOU WISH YOUR OWN PICTURE TO</p><p>BE WORN AROUND THE NECK, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU DENY BEING A GURU?</p><p>I deny being a guru, but I do not deny your being a disciple. One
should never be a guru, but discipleship is something without which
nothing is possible. And when there is no guru, then discipleship is
something inner -- an inner discipline. Both these words come from the
same root. 'Discipleship' means a mind which is</p><p>ready to seek, search, learn -- a mind which is open and vulnerable.
So I deny being a guru, but I do not deny your being a disciple.</p><p>Another point... the mala with a picture has so many reasons behind
it. One, the picture is not mine. Had it been mine, I would have
hesitated to put it there. No one would be courageous enough to put his
own picture. Everyone would think of putting it there, but no one would
put it there. The picture only appears as mine, it is not. No picture of
me is possible really. The moment one knows himself, one knows he is
something which cannot be depicted, described, framed. I exist as an
emptiness which cannot be pictured, which cannot be photographed. That
is why I could put the picture there.</p><p>Two or three things more are to be understood. The more you know that
picture, the more you concentrate on it, the more you come in tune with
it, then the more you will feel what I am saying. The more you
concentrate on it, the more there will not be the first question about
the picture. And the moment you remember me, even unknowingly, in a way
I am there. But this you will come to experience by and by.</p><p>So many more reasons are there, but I will not talk about them. This
much is enough.</p><p>Other reasons will be revealed, and it is better that they should not
be revealed now.</p><p>There are things which should not be talked about, because even by
talking about them they become superficial. There are things which
should remain occult, should remain secret, because they work in
secrecy, otherwise they won't work. They are just like roots of a tree:
the roots must remain underground, in the dark, unknown to the tree.
Only then do they work.</p><p>So there are occult things which must remain unconscious,
underground. You must not know them -- only then do they work, otherwise
they will not work. The roots must not be known. They must remain
hidden. So there are many things you ask that I will not answer, or I
will answer only up to that limit where the hiddenness is not uncovered.
The hidden must remain hidden. You will come to know, but only by
experience.</p><p>After three months you will not be able to remain a single moment
without the mala. You will feel the difference. But that will be your
knowing. It is so great, it</p><p>cannot remain unfelt. And by and by, as the experience grows deeper
and richer, you will not feel the picture there. With your deepening
consciousness, the locket will become empty.</p><p>Everyone will see the picture, but not you. When this happens, then
you can communicate with me directly, immediately, without any
medium.</p><p>I am trying in so many ways to convey things without any medium,
because there are things which cannot be conveyed through any medium. So
I will have to create devices --</p><p>this sannyas is a device, this initiation is a device. Those who are
initiated will soon become capable of knowing things which cannot be
told to others -- of so many secrets, keys, which no one can ordinarily
understand unless he has seasoned, ripened through occult training.</p><p>This is only the beginning; much is to follow. If I feel you are
receptive, then much will follow. If I feel you are not receptive, then
the beginning will be the end. You will gain much even in the beginning,
but not the whole thing. So in many ways I try to know your
receptivity.</p><p>If someone comes, I give him the mala and the picture with it. It is
predictable that he should ask, "Why this picture of yours?" This is
very predictable. But if he does not ask -</p><p>- if he simply takes the mala and asks no questions, if he is not
curious -- he has given a deeper hint about himself, that things which
cannot be questioned can be delivered to him. There are things which
cannot be delivered if questioned, because no proof can be given for
them, no reasoning can be given for them. There cannot be answers to
some questions. They are bare statements of knowing -- with no proofs,
with no criteria.</p><p>So if I see someone who comes to me, and I have given him things
about which the ordinary mind is prone to ask questions and he does not
ask them, he has proven capable of being given deeper things which
should not be questioned. In so many ways, how tethered you are! How
much you are tethered to the reasoning part of the mind must be known. I
have to know it because the more you are tethered to reason, the less
you are capable of knowing the deeper things... because reason is the
most superficial part of your being, the most superficial.</p><p>Although it claims to be the deepest -- and only the superficial
claims to be the deep --</p><p>reason is the most superficial part of your being. It has something
to do, it has some utility, but only utility. If you think of it as a
vehicle to go into the unknown, then you will never, never be able to
know anything that is worth knowing.</p><p>So I use so many devices to know you also. And each and everything
has so many reasons. For example, the case of a person who resists:
someone wrote me a letter fifteen days ago saying, "I can be initiated
by you. I want to be initiated by you, but I cannot make you my
guru."</p><p>I am no one's guru, I myself never claim to be a guru -- but to this
man I will claim to be a guru. To this man I cannot say "I allow you not
to think of me as your guru." He has shown his incapacity so clearly. If
you are not a disciple, then I will have to be a guru. If you are a
disciple, then I need not be a guru, there is no necessity. But if you
insist on your egoistic non-surrender, then I will have to insist on so
many things to destroy your ego. I will have to use so many devices to
make you egoless.</p><p>If you are egoless, then I will not use any device. So the problem
becomes more puzzling.</p><p>To one who is ready to be a disciple, I will say, "I am not your
guru. It is enough that you are a disciple." But to the one who says, "I
will not believe you, I will not take you as my guru," I will insist.
Otherwise, this man cannot be initiated. He is coming with a condition,
and you cannot be initiated with your conditions.</p><p>Initiation means that you are ready to surrender, ready to trust;
otherwise you need not go through the initiation. The initiation is
nothing, this mala is nothing, this robe is nothing.</p><p>This is only the entrance, now the ways will be darker. There will be
things which you have not imagined. You will have to trust, otherwise
you cannot take a single step. So it is better to know at the entrance
that you are incapable of trust, that any effort to lead you in will be
unnecessary and futile.</p><p>Religion is basically neither believing nor disbelieving. Religion is
trusting, it is trust.</p><p>And whenever there is an unknown to be jumped into, there is no other
way. Unless you trust, you cannot know it. And you do not know it now.
So what can you do? You can only trust and take the jump. This mala will
also help you to create this trust.</p><p>When I say that if you meditate on the picture the picture will be
absent, do not take it on trust. Try it, and it will happen. When I say
that when the picture is absent you can communicate with me, do not take
it as a trust. Try it. Take it hypothetically and experiment with it.
The moment the picture is absent and you can communicate with me, you
will be ready for the things which will need your trust. Then you can
take further steps with a trusting mind.</p><p>The more civilization has progressed, the more the ego has become
crystallized. The ego is the only barrier, and now it is the greatest
barrier. It was not so always.</p><p>Sariputta came to Buddha. He was one of the most learned men of those
times. He questioned many things, he asked many questions, he discussed
so many things, then he was initiated. From the moment he was initiated,
then continuously for thirty years he was with Buddha. But then he would
never ask anything.</p><p>So someone asked, "Sariputta, you were such a learned man. People say
you know even more than Buddha..."as far as information is concerned, he
was a Mahapandit, a great scholar. "... When you came, you discussed
such deep things, you questioned many things. We were very happy that
someone had come who questions Buddha, so that we could come to know
many things which might have remained unknown. Through your questions we
could know them. But why have you become silent?"</p><p>Sariputta said, "The moment I was ready to be initiated, I had to
stop my questions, because to question anything is absurd. I questioned
everything before</p><p>-- before taking the trust. Now my mind is settled."</p><p>Sometimes Buddha would say such absurd things, just to find out
whether Sariputta would ask again. He said such absurd things that
anyone would begin to ask, "What are you saying?" But Sariputta would be
silent.</p><p>Buddha said to him, "Wherever you are, always pay respect to the
direction in which I am -- wherever you are." Wherever he was wandering,
he would always</p><p>pay respect in the direction where Buddha was dwelling.</p><p>Sariputta became an awakened one after Buddha's death. Someone said,
"You have become awakened. Now you need not pay respect to anybody. You
yourself have become a buddha." Sariputta said, "I could not pay respect
before, because I was not awakened and the ego was there. Now I cannot
pay respect because I have become awakened. Then when will I pay
respect? I could not pay respect before, and even if I paid respect, it
was with very great difficulty, and the respect paid with difficulty is
no respect. Then I could not pay respect because of the ego. Now you say
I should not pay because I have become awakened. Then when will I pay
respect?" Sariputta said, "Buddha does not need it, but now is the
moment. Before it was impossible."</p><p>But these were times when trust was easy. Now trust has become quite
impossible; that is why religion has become impossible. Religion is
bound to be irrational and contradictory.</p><p>To jump into existence is bound to be irrational, it is a jump from
the rational to the irrational. So by and by I will have to make you
ready and prepared. Little by little I will make you ready to go into
the irrational. Even if I answer you it is not to convince your reason,
but just to shatter it. Even if I sometimes appear to be rational, it is
only as a beginning. It is only to begin with your mind. If you feel as
if I am rational, then your mind is attuned.</p><p>The moment I see you are attuned, I will push you into the
irrational. There is no way except that one is pushed into the
irrational. And this is not much. The more you are ready, the more I
will put things on you which will look insane in others' eyes. The
moment I see that you are ready to be insane, when you are not afraid of
others' eyes and others' opinions, even of your own reason you are not
afraid, only then can the deeper keys be handed over to you, not before.
Otherwise, you will just throw the keys away, you will not be able to
appreciate them. You will not be able even to understand that they are
keys.</p><p>So by and by all those who have been initiated into sannyas will have
to be ready to go into the irrational. Existence is such, it does not
reply to questions. Life is such, it gives no explanations. It is. And
all our questions and all our answers are only deceptions. Even
scientific answers are deceptions, because they never really answer
anything. They only push the question a step back They only go on
pushing questions. You become tired, so you do not ask.</p><p>No question is answerable through answers. Through the existential
jump every question is solved, but not through intellect. If you ask a
scientist why oxygen and hydrogen combined create water, he will say
that it just happens, it is so: "We can say only this --</p><p>that it just happens." But why does it happen? No one will go to ask
the scientist why oxygen and hydrogen can create water. Why? Why not
helium and oxygen? There is no answer.</p><p>The scientist will say, "We can say only how it happens, not why."
But with religion we always ask why. Even science, which claims to be
rational, cannot answer why. Religion, which never claims to be
rational, is always being asked, "Why?"</p><p>You ask me, "Why this mala? Why this picture?" I will say, "Use it in
this way, and this will happen," and my answer is as scientific as
possible. Religion never claims to be rational, the only claim is of
being irrational.</p><p>Use the mala in this way: meditate on the picture, then the picture
will not be there. It happens so. Then the absent picture becomes a
door. Through that door communicate with me. It happens so. After doing
meditation, take this mala off and feel, and then put this mala on and
feel, and you will see the difference.</p><p>Without this mala you will feel totally unprotected, totally in the
reins of a force which can be harmful. With this mala on you will feel
protected, you will be more confident, settled. Nothing can disturb from
the outside. It happens so; you will do the experiment and know. Why it
happens cannot even be answered scientifically. And religiously there is
no question to answer. Religion never claims, that is why so many
rituals of religion become irrelevant.</p><p>As time passes by, a very meaningful ritual will become meaningless,
because keys are lost and no one can say why this ritual exists. Then it
becomes just a dead ritual. You cannot do anything with it. You can
perform it, but the key is lost. For example, you can go on wearing the
mala, and if you do not know that the picture in it is meant for some
inner communication, then it will be just a dead weight. Then the key is
lost. The mala may be with you, but the key is lost. Then one day or
another you will have to throw away the mala because it is useless.</p><p>The mala is a device for meditation. It is a key. But this will come
only through</p><p>experience. I can only help you toward the experience. And unless it
happens, you will not know. But it can happen, it is so easy, it is not
difficult at all. When I am alive, it is so easy. When I am not there,
it will be very difficult.</p><p>All these statues that have existed on this earth were used as such
devices, but now they are meaningless. Buddha declared that his statue
should not be made. But the work that was done by statues still will
have to be done. Although the statue is meaningless, the real thing is
the work that can be done through it.</p><p>Those who follow Mahavira can communicate with Mahavira through his
statue even today. So what should Buddha's disciples do? That is why the
Bodhi tree became so important; it was used instead of Buddha's statue.
For five hundred years after Buddha there was no statue. In the Buddhist
temples only a picture of the Bodhi tree and two symbolic footprints
were kept, but this was sufficient. That still continues. The tree that
exists in Bodhgaya is in continuity with the original tree. So still
today those who know the key can communicate with Buddha through the
Bodhi tree at Bodhgaya. It is not just meaningless that monks from all
over the world come to Bodhgaya. But they must know the key, otherwise
they will just go and the whole thing will be just a ritual.</p><p>So these are keys -- particular mantras chanted in a particular way,
pronounced in a particular way, emphasized in a particular way with
such-and-such frequencies. A wavelength should be created, the waves
should be created. Then the Bodhi tree is not just a Bodhi tree; it
becomes a passage, it opens a door. Then twenty-five centuries are no
more, the time gap is not there. You come face to face with Buddha. But
keys are always lost. So this much can be said: use the locket, and you
will know much. All that I have said will be known, and more that I have
not said will be known also.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A SPIRITUAL SEEKER?</p><p>It means two things, primarily. One, that life as it is known
outwardly is not fulfilling, life as it is known outwardly is
meaningless. The moment one becomes aware of this fact, that this whole
life is just a meaningless thing, then the seeking begins. This is the
negative part, but unless this negative part is there, the positive
cannot follow. Spiritual seeking means primarily a negative</p><p>feeling, a feeling that life as it is, is meaningless, this whole
process just ends in death: "Dust unto dust." Nothing remains
conclusively in one's hands. You pass through life with such agony, with
such hell, and nothing is achieved conclusively.</p><p>This is the negative part of spiritual seeking, and the whole life
helps you toward this.</p><p>This part -- this negativity, this frustration, this anguish -- is
the part the world is to do.</p><p>Once you become really aware of this fact of the meaninglessness of
life as it exists, then your seeking ordinarily begins, because with a
meaningless life you cannot be at ease.</p><p>With a meaningless life an abyss is created between you and all that
is life. An unbridgeable gap grows, becoming wider and wider. You feel
unanchored. Then a search for something which is meaningful, blissful,
begins. That is the other part, the positive part.</p><p>Spiritual seeking means to come to terms with actual reality, not
with the dream projection. Our whole life is just a projection, our
dream projection. It is not to know what is, it is to achieve what is
desired. You can take the word `desire' as a symbol of our so-called
life -- it is a desired projection. You are not in search of what is,
you are in search of what is desired. So you go on desiring, and life
will go on being frustrating, because it is as it is. It cannot be as
you like it. You will be disillusioned. It is not that reality is
antagonistic to you, but that you are not in tune with reality, only in
tune with all your dreams. Your dreams will have a shattering
disillusionment. So when you are dreaming, it is all right. When any
dream is achieved, everything becomes disillusioning.</p><p>Spiritual seeking means knowing this negative part: that desiring is
the root cause of frustration. To desire is to create, of one's own
accord, a shell. Desiring is the world. To be worldly is to desire and
to go on desiring, never becoming aware that each desire comes to
nothing but frustration. Once you become aware of this, then you do not
desire, or your only desire is to know what is.</p><p>I am not to project myself but to know what is. Not that I should be
this way or the reality should be that way, but only this -- that
whatever reality may be, I want to know it, naked as it is. I should not
project. I should not come in. I want</p><p>to encounter it as it is.</p><p>Spiritual seeking positively means encountering existence as it is
without any desire. The moment there is no desire, the projecting
mechanism is not there working, then you can see what is. This "what is"
-- that which is -- once known, gives you all.</p><p>Desires always promise and never give. Desires always promise bliss,
ecstasy, but the end never comes, and each desire only terminates into
more desire. Each desire only creates in its place more desires that are
still greater and, of course, in the end, more frustrating.</p><p>A no-desiring mind is one that is in spiritual seeking. A spiritual
seeker is one who is completely aware of the nonsense of desire and is
ready to know what is. Once one is ready to know what is, reality is
always by the corner, just by the corner. But you are never there, you
are in the desire, in the future. Reality is always in the present --
here and now -- and you are never in the present. You are always in the
future, in your desires, in your dreams. In dreams, in desires, we are
asleep. And the reality is here and now.</p><p>Once this sleep has been broken, the dream has been broken and you
become awakened to the reality that is here and now, just in the
present. You are reborn. You come to ecstasy, to fulfillment, to all
that has always been desired but never achieved. Spiritual seeking is to
be here and now, and you can only be here and now when there is no
desiring mind; otherwise the desiring mind will create wavering. Just
like a pendulum, the mind goes either to the past, in the memory, or to
the future, in desires, in dreams. But it is never here and now, it
always misses the point of here and now. It just goes to the one
extreme, the past, or to the other, the future. We miss the reality
between these waverings of past and future.</p><p>Reality is here and now. It is never past and never future; it is
always present. Now is the only moment. Now is the only time. It never
passes. Now is eternal. It is always here, but we are not here. So to be
a spiritual seeker means to be here. You may call it meditation, you may
call it yoga, you may call it prayer. Whatever name is given it makes no
difference, the mind must not be. And the mind exists only when there is
past or future, otherwise there is no mind.</p><p>I was talking to someone yesterday. You cannot think in the present,
I was telling</p><p>him.</p><p>The moment you think, it has become the past. So the mind cannot
exist in the present. It exists only in the memory of the past, or it
projects into the future. It never comes in contact with the present --
it cannot come, that is impossible. So if there is no thought, there is
no mind. This no-mindness is meditation. Then you are here and now. Then
you explode into reality. Then the reality explodes into you.</p><p>Spiritual seeking is not for moksha, salvation after death. Again,
that is a desire, even more greedy than the desire for wealth, the
desire for prestige, the desire for power. The desire for moksha is even
more greedy, because it goes even beyond death.</p><p>Spiritual seeking is not to seek God, because again that is greed. If
you are seeking God, then again your mind is greedy. You must be seeking
God for something. However deep and unknown to you and unconscious to
you, you must be seeking God for something.</p><p>But I do not mean by this that when spiritual seeking comes to
fulfillment, there is no God. I am not saying that when you have come to
meditation and the mind is not, moksha is not. Moksha is there. You have
liberation but it is not your desire. It is just the consequence of
knowing the reality as it is.</p><p>God is there, but it is not because of your desiring. He is the
reality. So when you know the reality, you know it is divine. The
reality is divine. But seeking is not for God or moksha or bliss,
because whenever there is desire you will project again into the
future.</p><p>Spiritual seeking is disillusionment with the future and remaining in
the present, being in the present, being ready to face whatsoever comes
here and now. The divine explodes, the freedom comes, but these are not
your objects. They are consequences, shadows of the realization of the
real.</p><p>So first be aware of the whole process of life as frustrating. Not a
single illusion should be there, otherwise you will be tethered to it.
Go deep in each experience of life. Do not escape from it. Know it so
deeply that you know its disillusionment. Do not escape; do not
renounce. Only then this part is complete, and you can take the jump
into the here and now.</p><p>If you have become aware that the future is the root cause of all the
nonsense that the human mind creates, then you have taken the basic
step; you have traveled. Now you can be ready to be aware of what is. In
the first part, the negative part, life helps much. So go to every
experience, to every desire; know it. Never renounce prematurely.</p><p>This happens: you are not really frustrated with life, but have
become greedy for religious promises. You have not known that life is
divine, but you have become enchanted with religious heavens. Then
everything will be difficult, because you have not gone through the
first part. The second part will be very difficult.</p><p>So go through the first part and the second is very easy. The second
is only difficult when the first has not been traveled completely. Then
you ask, "How to meditate?" Then you say, "The mind goes on working."
Then you say, "The thought process is continuing. It cannot be stopped.
How can it be stopped?" Desire is there, so desire will go on creating
thoughts. The first part has not been fulfilled.</p><p>A mature spiritual seeker is one who has gone without any fear in
life, and knows every nook and corner. He has known it so much that
nothing has remained unknown. Then meditation is easy, because there is
no one to create thoughts, there is no one to create desires. Just by
shouting Hoo! you are in the present. Any simple device will make you
stand still. The staff of the Zen masters is raised and you are in the
present. Even such a simple device can help if the first part is
fulfilled.</p><p>One day the Zen monk Rinzai is speaking in a temple. He has gone into
a sermon, but someone is disturbing him there. So Rinzai stops and asks,
"What is the matter?" The man stands up and says, "What is soul?" Rinzai
takes his staff and asks the people to give him way. The man begins to
tremble. He never expected that such will be the answer.</p><p>Rinzai comes to him, takes hold of his neck with both hands and
presses it. The man's eyes bulge out. He goes on pressing and asks, "Who
are you? Close your eyes!" The man closes his eyes. Rinzai goes on
asking, "Who are you?" The man opens his eyes and laughs and bows down.
He says, "I know you have really answered what is soul."</p><p>Such a simple device! But the man was ready. Someone asks Rinzai,
"Would you</p><p>do the same thing when anybody asks?" He says, "That man was ready.
He was not just asking for the question's sake, he was ready. The first
part was fulfilled; he was really asking.</p><p>This was a life and death question to him: `What is soul?' The first
part was fulfilled completely. He was disillusioned completely of life,
and he was asking,</p><p>`What is soul?'</p><p>This life has proved just a death to him; now he is asking, `What is
life?' So no answer from me would have been meaningful. I helped him to
just stand still in the present."</p><p>Of course, when someone presses your neck just on the verge of
killing you, you cannot be in the future, you cannot be in the past. You
will be here and now. It is dangerous to miss the moment. If you just
say to such a man, "Go deep and know who you are," the man becomes
transformed. He goes into samadhi; he stands still in the moment.</p><p>If you are in the present, even for a single moment, you have known,
you have encountered, and you will never be able to lose the track
again.</p><p>Spiritual feeling is to know what is -- what is all this. Not that,
this. What is all this -- this me speaking, this you hearing, this
whole? What is this? Just stand, be deep in this. Let it open to you,
and let yourself open to it. Then there is a meeting. That meeting is
the seeking.</p><p>That meeting is the whole search. That is why we have called it yoga.
Yoga means meeting. The very word yoga means meeting -- joining again,
becoming one once more.</p><p>But so-called spiritual seekers are not seeking any spirituality.
They are only projecting their desires in a new dimension. And no desire
can be projected in this spiritual dimension, because this spiritual
dimension is only open to those who are not desiring. So those who
desire go on creating new illusions, new dreams.</p><p>First know that desire is just running and reaching nowhere. Then
stand still, and know what is. Everything is open. Only we are closed in
our desires. The whole existence is open. All doors are open, but we are
running with such a speed that we cannot see. And the more we become
frustrated, the more we increase the</p><p>speed, because the mind says,</p><p>"You are not running fast enough. That is why you are not reaching."
The mind will not say, "Because you are running, you will not reach."
How can it say that? It is illogical.</p><p>The mind says, "Because you are not running fast enough, that is why
you are not reaching. So run faster. Those who are running faster, they
are reaching." And ask those who are running faster. Their minds are
saying the same thing: "Run faster still. Those who are really running,
they are reaching."</p><p>No one is reaching, but always someone is ahead of you and someone is
behind. You have gone ahead of someone, but wherever you are, someone is
always ahead. Why?</p><p>Because desire runs in a circle. We are running in a circle. So if
you run very fast, even the person who was behind may come to be ahead
of you. Because we are running in a circle, someone is going to be ahead
always, and the feeling will be there that you are not running fast
enough, that someone else is reaching and you are losing.</p><p>We in this land knew so many truths. We called this world sansar.
Sansar means the wheel -- not only are you running, but the wheel itself
is also running. It is not a steady circle. Even if you stand, the wheel
will go on. So one has not only to stop, but to step out of the
wheel.</p><p>This stepping out is sannyas. Stopping is not enough. You must step
off the wheel, because even if you are not running, the wheel will go on
rotating. And it is such a great wheel, with such a force, that you will
be running even though you are standing in one place. To step off means
sannyas -- not only to stop running, but to step off. Do not be on the
wheel. Just come out of the rut. Be a witness to it. Only then will you
know what this wheel is made of , why it goes on running even when you
are not running.</p><p>The wheel is created by infinite desires, by all desires that have
ever existed, that are in existence today -- all the desires of all
persons, of all beings who have ever existed. You will die, but your
desires have created waves which will go on. You will not be here, but
your desires have created ripples in the noesphere. You will not be
here, but I have said something; these words, these sounds, will go on
vibrating infinitely.</p><p>Whatever you have desired -- fulfilled, unfulfilled, it makes no
difference -- the moment the desire has come into your mind, into your
heart, you have created ripples, waves.</p><p>They will go on. This wheel, this sansar, is constituted of all the
desires that have existed and all the desires that are in existence.
This is such a great force, of all the dead and of all the living, that
you cannot stand still. They will push you, you have to run.</p><p>It is just like in a crowd. When the whole crowd is running you
cannot stand still. You are just pushed to run. You are safe if you are
running; if you are not running you will be killed. It is not that your
energy is needed to run. If you do not make any effort, the crowd will
push you. This is the wheel -- the wheel of desires. You must have seen
the Tibetan picture of the wheel. It is beautifully depicted -- the
whole wheel of desires.</p><p>To step out of the wheel is sannyas. You just come out of the crowd.
You just step down.</p><p>You just sit by the side of the road, you say goodbye. Only then do
you know the phenomenon of what is the wheel. Only then do you know that
some persons are running in a circle, they will pass you so many times
-- then you know that this is a wheel.</p><p>A Buddha, a Mahavira, could call this world sansar, a wheel, because
they knew that it was a wheel when they stepped aside. It is not that
you are running in a line, it is a circle -</p><p>- repeating the same desires, the same days, the same nights, the
same disillusionments, and going on in the whirlwind. Pushed from
behind, pulled from the front, you go on.</p><p>Sannyas means to step aside, to step out. This is the second part of
sannyas. Sannyas has two parts. The first part is knowing the
frustration, knowing the anguish. This is the miracle: once you know
that the world is anguish, the world is frustration, you are not
frustrated at all. The frustration comes because you think the world is
not frustrating. The anguish comes because you hope even when you know
it is hopeless. That hoping is nonsense. When you know this, then you do
not feel hopeless at all. Then there is no need to feel so. Then there
is nothing to feel hopeless about -- there is no hope.</p><p>That is why Buddhism could not be understood. The Western mind could
only interpret it as pessimism. It was a natural fallacy. Buddhism is
not pessimistic. But to the Western mind it appeared pessimistic,
because of the saying that the world is frustrating, the world is dukkha
-- misery. This makes you pessimistic. But this is not the case. The
earth has not known so happy, so blissful a person as Buddha, or, it has
known very few such people. He was not a pessimist at all. So what is
the secret? The secret is this: if you know this world is dukkha, then
you do not expect anything except dukkha. Expectation only creates
pessimism. When there is no expectation, then there is no need to be in
misery. Once life is known as miserable, you will never be in misery,
you will be out of it.</p><p>So a sannyasin is not one who is frustrated. A sannyasin is one who
has known the world as frustrating. He is not frustrated, he is most at
ease. There is nothing to frustrate him.</p><p>Everything that happens, he knows it happens so. Even death is not an
anguish to him, because death is a certainty.</p><p>Once you know the nature of this whirling wheel -- of this world, of
this so- called life, of this repetitive vicious circle -- then you will
become a silent and a blissful person. Now you do not hope, so there is
no feeling of hopelessness. You are at ease, composed. The more you are
at ease, the more you are composed. The more you are in the moment, the
more you are non-wavering, standing still.</p><p>In this very moment, here and now, is all that is to be known and
realized -- moksha, God, the reality -- in this moment. So in a way,
spiritual seeking is not for something. It is not for some object. It is
to know what is, and the knowing comes once you are in the moment.</p><p>To be in the moment is the secret door, or you may say the open
secret. To be in the moment is the open secret.</p><p>I Am the Gate Chapter #4</p><p>Chapter title: Love, grace and divinity 20 April 1971 am in Bombay,
India</p><p>Archive code:</p><p>7104200</p><p>ShortTitle:</p><p>GATE04</p><p>Audio:</p><p>Yes Video: No Question 1</p><p>BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>QUALITIES OF LOVE AND GRACE HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE DIVINE.</p><p>DO THESE QUALITIES EXIST? DOES THE DIVINE EXIST? CAN THIS BE
EXPLAINED?</p><p>To say that the divine exists will not be right, because all that
exists is divine. Each and everything exists, only the divine cannot be
said to exist. The divine is existence. To be divine and to exist is to
say the same thing in two different ways. So the quality of existence
cannot be attributed to the divine.</p><p>Everything else can be said to exist because it can go into
non-existence. I can be said to exist because I will go into
non-existence, you can be said to exist because there were times when
you were not in existence. But the divine cannot be said to exist
because the divine is always there. Its non-existence is inconceivable,
so existence cannot be attributed to the divine. I will say existence is
divine, or divineness means existence.</p><p>Nothing exists which is not divine. You may know it or not, it makes
no difference as far as your divinity is concerned. If you know it, then
you become</p><p>existence, bliss. If you do not know it, you go on and continue in
agony, but you are divine. When asleep, when ignorant, then too you are
divine. Even a stone is divine, unknown to itself. Existence is
divine.</p><p>All those who try to prove that God exists do not know. This is sheer
nonsense to prove that God exists. Those who try to prove that God does
not exist are in the same boat. No one will prove that existence exists.
If you say it this way, if you ask me whether existence exists, the
question will be absurd.</p><p>To me, when someone says that God exists, it means the same thing,
that existence exists.</p><p>God and existence are equivalent, synonyms. Once you have become
aware of what existence is, you will not call it existence. Then you
will call it God. The moment one becomes aware of the total being that
is, then you cannot use the existence. You become more intimate with it,
so you have to use a personal name. You call it God. To call existence
God only means this and nothing else: that you can be in an intimate
relationship with it, that you can be in personal contact with it.</p><p>It is not something dead. It is not something to which you cannot be
related. It is not something which is indifferent to you. When we say
existence is God, we mean to say existence is intimately related with
us. We are related with it, and it is not indifferent to us. But as far
as the human mind is concerned, we do not know a more accurate word to
use than God.</p><p>If you ask some orthodox Jew, he will not use the full word God. He
will only use G-D</p><p>the O is dropped. If you ask them, "Why do you use G-D, why is the O
dropped?" they say, "Whatever we say is always less than what is. So O
is dropped just to symbolize that we are using a word which cannot
convey the whole, which cannot be totally comprehensive." The O is
symbolic of zero, symbolic of perfection, symbolic of totality, the
whole. So the O is dropped, only G-D remains.</p><p>Whenever we use any word, it is never meaningful or comprehensive of
the whole. It just indicates not something about the divine, but about
the human mind. If you say Ã¨xistence', then you use a term which is
neutral. You can be indifferent to it, and existence can be indifferent
to you. When you use Ã¨xistence'</p><p>there cannot be a dialogue between you and existence. Then there is
no bridge. But those who have known existence know there is a dialogue
with everything that exists; you can be in an intimate relationship, in
love. This possibility of dialogue, this possibility of relationship,
this possibility of being in love, makes the term `God' more meaningful
than Ã¨xistence', but they mean the same.</p><p>So I will not say that the divine exists, I will say that all that
exists is divine. Existence is divine. To exist is to be divine. Nothing
is which is not divine. Nothing can be which is not divine. We may know
it, we may not know it; we may be aware, we may not be aware. It makes
no difference.</p><p>Another thing you asked is whether the qualities of love and grace
can be attributed to God. Again, no qualities can be attributed to him,
because qualities can be attributed only if the contrary is possible.
You can say, "Someone loves me," because someone is capable of not
loving. If he is incapable of not loving, you will never say, "He loves
me."</p><p>Then to say that someone loves you carries no meaning. If I cannot be
in love, I can only be in hatred. Then I can say, "I love you." If I am
incapable of being in hatred, then the quality of love cannot be
attributed to me. Love then is not a quality, but nature. And what is
the difference between quality and nature?</p><p>A quality is something which can be in manifestation and which can be
in non- manifestation. A quality is something of which you can be
deprived. You can exist with the quality, you can exist without the
quality. It is not your intrinsic existence. It is something attributed
to you, it is something added to you. It is not your nature.</p><p>Nature is something without which you can never exist. So when
someone says, "God is loving," he is not saying exactly the right thing.
Jesus is right when he says, "God is love," not loving. Then love
becomes his nature, not a quality. It cannot be replaced. God can be
love, love can be God, because love is the intrinsic nature of the
divine.</p><p>Love is not something added, it cannot be. It is not possible to
conceive of God without love. If you conceive of God without love, you
are conceiving of a God who is not a God.</p><p>To conceive of God without love is to conceive of a God without
godliness, because the moment love is erased there is no godliness left
behind. So again, I</p><p>will not say that love is an attribute. Neither will I say that grace
is an attribute; they are nature.</p><p>Somewhere Aesop has told us in a fable that by a riverside a scorpion
requested of a turtle, "Please carry me to the other shore on your
back." The turtle says, "Don't be foolish. Don't think me stupid. You
may sting me in the middle of the stream, and I will drown and die." The
scorpion said, "I am not foolish; rather, you are foolish, because you
do not know simple logic. I belong to the Aristotelian school, I am a
logician. So I will teach you a simple lesson in logic. If I sting you
and if you are drowned and dead, I will also die with you. So be
sensible, be logical. I will not sting you. I cannot sting you."</p><p>The turtle thought for a moment and then said, "Okay! It seems
sensible. Hop on me, and off we go." And exactly in midstream the sting
comes. They both are sinking down.</p><p>Before the turtle dies it asks, "Where has your logic gone? You have
done a very illogical thing, and you yourself said that this is simple
logic, that you would never do it, and now you have done it. Tell me
before I die. Let me learn another lesson of your logic."</p><p>The scorpion says, "It is not a question of logic at all, it is just
my nature. I cannot be without it. I can talk about it, but I cannot be
without it. I am incapable, really."</p><p>Something which you are incapable of doing or not doing indicates
your nature. We cannot conceive of the divine as being non-loving or
without grace. The love is always there, the grace is always there. We
use two words -- love and grace -- because of our linguistic imitations.
Otherwise, one word will do. Either you call it love or you call it
grace.</p><p>We use two words because with love we always expect something in
return, but not with grace. Whenever we love someone, something in
return is expected. It is always a bargain, howsoever subtle. Told or
not told, made known or not made known, it is an inner bargain.
Something is expected in return. That is why we use two words, `love'
and</p><p>`grace', because with grace nothing is expected in return, and God
never expects anything in return from us.</p><p>But as far as divine existence is concerned, love and grace are both
one and the same. He is loving, and that is his grace. He is always with
his grace, that means he is loving. But these are not qualities which
can be attributed to him. This is his nature, he cannot be otherwise.
But we make distinctions because someone is known to have received
grace, someone has become beloved to the divine. That again is a
fallacious statement. God is always grace and always love. But we are
not always in the receptive mood.</p><p>Unless we become receptive we cannot receive it. So when you are not
receiving divine grace, it is not anything lacking on the part of the
divine, but something like a barrier you are carrying. You are not
vulnerable to it. God's nature is to be graceful, to be grace
itself.</p><p>But as far as we are concerned, we are not naturally receptive, we
are naturally aggressive. And these are two different things.</p><p>If the mind is aggressive, then it cannot be receptive. Only a
non-aggressive mind can be receptive. So all the qualities which carry
any type of aggressiveness with them ought to be dropped, and one has to
be just a door to receive. Just like a womb, one has to be in total
receptivity. Then grace is always flowing, and love is always
flowing.</p><p>From everywhere grace is flowing. Every moment, everywhere, grace is
flowing. It is the nature of existence. But we are not receptive, that
is the nature of mind. Mind is aggressive. That is why I always insist
that meditation means no-mind. Meditation means non-aggressive
receptivity -- openness. But logic can never be receptive, logic is
aggressive. You are doing something, then you cannot be receptive. You
can be receptive only when you are not doing.</p><p>When you are in a non-doing state, absolutely non-doing, simply
existing, then you are open from, all sides, and from everywhere comes
the flow of grace. It is always coming, but our doors are closed. We are
always escaping the grace. Even if it knocks on our doors, we
escape.</p><p>There is a reason why we go on escaping: the moment mind is born, it
is always safeguarding itself. Our whole training, our whole education,
the whole culture of mankind is always so. Our whole mind, our whole
culture, is based on aggression, competition, conflict. We have not yet
become so matured as to learn the secret of cooperation -- that the
world exists in cooperativeness, not in</p><p>conflict; that the other one, the neighboring one, is not just a
competitor, but a complementary existence which makes me richer. Without
him I will be less. Even if a single individual dies in the world I am a
bit less. The richness that was created by him, the richness carried
into the atmosphere, is no more. Somewhere, something has become vacant.
So we exist in a coexistence, not in a conflict.</p><p>But the mind, the collective unconscious, is always thinking in terms
of conflict.</p><p>Whenever someone is there, the enemy is there. The enemy is the basic
assumption. You can develop your friendship, but that will be developed.
The basic assumption is the enemy. Friendship can be added to the enemy,
but the base in inimical, and you can never relax.</p><p>That is why you can never rely on your friendships, because at the
base there is enemy.</p><p>You have only made a fake friendship, you have added something
artificially. But somewhere at the base you know always that there is
the enemy -- the other is the enemy.</p><p>So even with a friend you are not at ease, even with your lover you
are not at ease.</p><p>Whenever there is someone, you are tense -- the enemy is there. Of
course, the tension becomes less if you have created a facade of
friendship. It is less, but it is there.</p><p>This attitude has reasons as to why it has developed so --
evolutionary reasons. Man has come out of the jungle. The whole
evolution has seen so many stages, so many animal stages.
Physiologically also the body knows, because the body is not yours. When
I say my body, I am claiming something which cannot be claimed. My body
has come through centuries of development. The basic cell is inherited,
in my basic cell I inherit all that existed behind me. All the animals,
all the trees, all that has existed has contributed to my basic
cell.</p><p>In my basic cell there is accumulated the whole experience of
conflict, struggle, violence, aggression. Each cell carries the whole
evolutionary struggle that has preceded.</p><p>Physiologically also, mentally also, your mind has not evolved just
in this life, it has come to you in a long journey. It may be even
longer than the body itself. Because the body evolved on this earth, it
cannot be more than forty million years old. It cannot be older than the
earth.</p><p>But the first mind came from another planet, mind has still deeper
evolutionary experiences. And all those experiences make you violent and
aggressive. One has to be aware of this total phenomenon. Unless one is
aware, one cannot be free from his own past. The whole problem is that
one has to be free from his own past, and this past is something very
great -- incomprehensibly great.</p><p>All that has lived is still living with you. All that has been is
still in you in seed, in potentiality. You come from the past, you are
the past. This past-oriented mind goes on creating aggression, goes on
thinking in terms of aggression.</p><p>So when religion says be receptive, the advice goes unheard. The mind
cannot think of how it can be receptive. Mind has known only one thing
in which it has been receptive, and that is death, in which the mind has
not been able to do anything, then it could not act. The only thing that
the mind has known in which it has to be receptive is death. So whenever
someone says, "Be receptive," somewhere in the shadows you feel death.
If I say, "Be receptive," the mind will then say, "Then you will die. Be
aggressive if you want to exist and survive. The fittest survives. The
most aggressive one survives. If you are just receptive, you will
die."</p><p>That is why receptivity is never understood -- not heard, not
understood. This receptivity has been said in so many ways. Someone
says, "Surrender." It means to be receptive.</p><p>Surrender means do not be aggressive. When someone says, "Be
faithful," it means to be receptive.</p><p>Do not be aggressive through your logic. Receive existence as it is.
Let it come in. The mind cannot love, because love means to be receptive
to someone. Even in love we are aggressive. If you ask a friend, he will
say love is nothing but a sort of violence, a mutual violence in which
two partners have agreed to become involved. And when a friend says
this, he is not just saying nonsense. He means it, and he knows
something.</p><p>Whenever you are in a sexual act, whenever you are in intimate love,
the actions</p><p>that follow are just like fighting -- you are fighting. If you go
deep in any act which we know as love, if you go deep in it, you will
find animal roots. Kissing can become biting anytime. If you go on
kissing, if it goes deep, it will be biting. It is just a mind form.</p><p>Sometimes lovers will say, "I want to eat you" -- a very loving
expression. Really, they try. Sometimes it goes deep, becomes intensive,
then sex is just a fight.</p><p>So two partners, two sexual partners, will always alternate between
love and fighting. In the evening they are fighting, in the night they
are loving; in the morning they are fighting, in the evening they are
loving; in the night they are fighting... This circle will go on --
fighting and loving, fighting and loving. If you ask D.H. Lawrence, he
will say, "If you cannot fight with your lover, you cannot love." The
fight makes it intense. It is just creating a situation.</p><p>The human mind as it is, as it has come out of the past, cannot love
because it cannot be receptive. It can only be aggressive. So it is not
that you are loving -- you always demand love. And even if you act
loving, it is only to force the demand. There is a cunning logic.</p><p>It is always demanding, "Give me love." And if I give you love, that
is only to demand, to make the demand more forceful. The human mind
cannot love.</p><p>So if you ask those who have really known love, if you ask Buddha, he
will say, "Unless the mind dies, love cannot be born." And unless there
is love, you cannot feel grace, because only in love do you become
open.</p><p>And you cannot love a particular individual because it is impossible
to be open to a particular individual and closed to all. This is one of
the most impossible things to do.</p><p>If I say, "I love you," it is just like saying, "Whenever you are
beside me I breathe, otherwise I do not breathe." If this were the case,
then another time you will come to me, and you will find me dead. But
breathing is not something which I can do and not do; love is not
something like that. But whatever is known to us as love is like that.
That is why sooner or later a lover will find that the other's love has
gone dead, and both will know this. Both will know that there is no love
now.</p><p>The more lovers know each other, the more unfortunate is the
situation. The more they become acquainted with each other, the lesser
the hope and the more the disillusionment.</p><p>They know that the love has gone dead. You so narrowed it, demanded
so narrow a passage, that it could not be alive.</p><p>One has to be loving, not a lover. This loving must come as an
intensive, natural manifestation, not as something added as an
attribute, as a quality. It must come as an inner flowering, not as
something perfumed from without. This love can happen. One has to be
aware of one's total past. And the moment you have transcended, you are
beyond it, because that which is aware is not the mind.</p><p>That which becomes aware of the mind is consciousness which carries
no past with it --</p><p>which is eternal, which is always in the now, which is always new,
which is always here and now. That consciousness is known only when you
become aware of your mind. Then you are not identified with your mind.
There is a gap between you and your mind. You know this is the mind --
this aggressiveness, this hatred, this whole hell, is the mind.</p><p>And this mind goes on continuing. This mind will go on continuing,
unless you become aware. And this is a miracle: that the moment you
become aware the continuity is broken.</p><p>Now you will be, but not of the past. Now you will be of the moment
-- fresh, young, new. Now each moment you will die, and you will be
reborn.</p><p>Somewhere, St.Â Augustine says, "I die every moment." One who has
become aware of one's whole mind and its whole process, the continuity,
the past continuing itself and carrying on and forcing itself into the
future -- one who has become aware of this will die each moment. Each
moment the past will be thrown out. One will be fresh, new and young,
ready to jump into the new moment that is coming on. Only this fresh
consciousness, this young consciousness -- eternally young -- is
receptive, is open. There are no walls to it, no boundary walls to it.
It is completely open, just like space.</p><p>The Upanishads call it the inner space of the heart. There is a
space, simply a space. That is consciousness, sakshi -- the expression
of awareness. This</p><p>transcendence of the mind, of the past, makes you open and vulnerable
from all sides, to all the dimensions. Then grace is falling on you from
everywhere -- from the trees, from the sky, from human beings, from
animals, from everywhere. Even a dead stone is graceful then. You feel
grace falling toward you.</p><p>Then you cannot say this is simply an existence. Then you say, "This
is God." This metamorphosis, this transformation of your own mind, this
transformation of the dead mind into an eternally living consciousness,
from the junk of the mind to the open sky of the consciousness... this
transformation changes your attitude toward existence. Then the whole
existence is just a flow of love -- friendly, compassionate, loving,
graceful. Then you are loved through thousands of hands.</p><p>So Hindu religion has created deities with a thousand hands. It means
that from everywhere is the hand; nowhere can you go where the divine
hand will not be upon you.</p><p>Everywhere is the embrace. You can go everywhere, now there is
nowhere where the divine is not.</p><p>Nanak went to Kaaba. He was tired when he reached the mosque, and he
just put down his small bundle, whatever it was, and went to sleep. The
priest was furious because his legs were toward the holy stone. So he
dragged him out and said, "What foolishness are you doing here? You do
not even have this much respect -- that the legs should not be toward
the holy stone. Are you an atheist?" Nanak's sleep was broken, and he
sat up. He said, "Put my legs in that direction where God is not, and do
not disturb me."</p><p>There is no direction where God is not, because the direction itself
is divine, existence is divine, but you must be open to it.</p><p>This whole tragedy, this dilemma of the human mind, is that the mind
is closed. The mind is closed and it goes on searching for that which
will be freedom. The mind is an imprisonment, and this imprisonment goes
on seeking freedom. This is the whole tragedy of human existence.</p><p>This mind is a prison. It cannot find any freedom anywhere. It must
die before freedom comes to you. But we have taken the mind as us, we
are identified with it. This death of mind never happens to us, it never
occurs to us.</p><p>Mind is something other than "me." But we go on being identified with
the mind. How then can you come out of the past if you have become
identified with the past? The one who has forgotten that he is a
prisoner is the most imprisoned, because there is no possibility of his
freedom then. But even that prisoner may become aware. An even greater
prisoner is the one who has become one with the imprisonment, one with
the prison, who has become identified. The walls of the prison are his
body. The whole arrangement of the imprisonment is his mind.</p><p>Be aware, be conscious of your mind. And you can be, because you are
something different. The dream can be broken, because you are not the
dream. The dream is occurring to you, but you are not the dream. You can
shatter this imprisonment and come out, because you are not the
imprisonment. But there is such a long association with the body and the
mind.</p><p>And understand this well: that the body is new, each birth is new.
Each beginning is new, but the mind is old. It is continuing from your
past births. That is why if someone says your body is ill, you are never
angry, you feel that he is sympathetic to you. But if someone says your
mind is mad, your mind is ill, you are mentally deranged, then you
become angry. Then you do not feel he is sympathetic to you. He does not
seem friendly.</p><p>With the body this is a new association, only of this birth. Other
bodies have died with which you have been in association, but this body
association is broken with each death.</p><p>It has been broken so many times that one thinks himself a body, even
he is not identified with his body. So if his body falls ill, something
else has fallen ill.</p><p>I was reading about an alcoholic's life. He was sentenced so many
times... For the tenth time the same judge is sending him to jail. So
the judge says in his judgment, "It is only the alcohol, the alcohol,
the alcohol, which is the root cause of your problems." The man says,
"Thank you, sir. You are the only person who has not made me
responsible.</p><p>Everyone else says I am at fault. You are the only man who
understands that alcohol is at fault, that I am not responsible at
all."</p><p>With the body, if there is some fault, you do not feel you are
responsible. But if the mind feels some fault, then you feel that you
are responsible. The identity is</p><p>keen and deeper. It has to be, because the body is the outer layer of
your being. The mind is the inner layer. It is the inner you, you can be
more identified with it. It has been with you for so many lives. The
mind is the old, always the old, the continuity. But you are not the
mind. And this can be known, and there is no difficulty in knowing about
it.</p><p>Just be a witness. Whenever the mind is working, just sit aside and
see it -- how it works.</p><p>Do not interfere. Do not come in. The coming in will again create the
strength which makes the identity. Do not come in. Do not say anything.
Do not be a judge. Just sit aside as if the traffic is passing on the
road and you are sitting by the side, just looking. Do not make any
judgement. And if even for a single moment you can sit aside and look at
the mind's traffic, the continuous traffic, you will see the gap -- the
gap between you and the mind. Then this gap can be made greater, wider
unbridgeable.</p><p>When the gap is such, when the interval is such, then there is no
bridge. You have seen from all possible points that the circle of the
mind is somewhere where you are not. You are always inside -- somewhere
else. When this is not a theory but a realized fact, then you are open.
Then you have jumped into an inner space, into the inner sky, into the
inner space of the heart. You have jumped in. Now you are there, and you
are open.</p><p>You will know then that you have always been open. You have been
sleeping in an open sky but dreaming that you are in prison, and
thoughts are not any other substance than dreams are made of. They are
of the same stuff. In the day you call them thoughts, and at night you
call them dreams. But because the thoughts are transparent, identifying
becomes easier. With anything transparent you can forget it is
there.</p><p>If there is a totally transparent glass between you and me, I will
forget the glass. I will think that I am seeing you directly. It means
that I become so totally identified with the glass that it is not there.
My eyes and the glass have become one.</p><p>Thoughts are transparent, more transparent than any glass you can
look through. They are not at all a hindrance then. That is why the
identity becomes deeper. The transparency of thoughts is so close to
you, you forget totally that there</p><p>exists a mind which is always around you, always between you and the
world. Always, wherever you are -- between you and your lover, between
you and your friend, between you and your God -- it is always there.</p><p>Wherever you go, your mind is a step ahead of you. It is not only
that it follows you like a shadow, it is always one step ahead of you,
it has reached before you. But you are never aware of it because it is
so transparent.</p><p>Whenever you are entering a temple, your mind has entered before you.
When you are going to a friend, when you are embracing him, your mind
has embraced before. And this you can know, your mind is always
rehearsing. That stepping ahead is always rehearsing.</p><p>Before you speak, it is always rehearsing what to speak. Before you
act, it is always rehearsing what to act. Before you do anything or do
not do anything, it is rehearsing.</p><p>The rehearsal means that the mind is preparing itself before you, it
is always one step ahead. And that is a constant, transparent barrier
between you and everything else that you will come across, that you will
encounter.</p><p>Thus an encounter can never be real, authentic, because something
else is always in between. Neither can you love, nor can you pray. You
cannot do anything which requires the removal of this barrier. The grace
is not felt because the barrier is there, always surrounding you like a
transparent shell. Grace or love or existence are not open to them.</p><p>When someone is open, he becomes the receiver. But then too we will
not say that he has become a receiver. The ego is competitive. We will
say he has received grace. We are denying him anything. Now we say, "God
has become graceful to him."</p><p>It is good that we should say God is graceful because now nothing
exists except God.</p><p>Once the barrier is not, there is nothing upon which to stand the
ego. He cannot say "I,"</p><p>so he cannot say, "I have become capable of receiving grace." He can
only say "I" have received because "I" was not there. "I" was the
barrier. So once "I" is</p><p>not, he can always say, "It is due to God's grace. What can I do? I
is no more."</p><p>It is right when he says so, but it is not right when we say so. We
are again deceiving ourselves. We are deceiving ourselves because we are
not recognizing a great transformation. The ego will not let us
recognize it. The ego will say, "God is graceful to him and not to me."
We create this very misguiding notion that God is graceful to someone.
He is grace.</p><p>If someone is ready to receive, he is always giving. He is not even
ready to give</p><p>-- he is giving. When you are not receiving, then too he is giving.
When you are closed, then too he is raining, his blessings are raining.
Be open and know it. Be conscious and be open, and only then you can
know what love is, what grace is, what compassion is. And they are one
and the same thing, they are not different things. Basically they are
one and the same.</p><p>Only then can you know what prayer is. When the barrier is not, then
prayer is not to ask for something, it is not begging. Then it is
thanksgiving. So wherever there is a prayer that begs for something, the
barrier is there. The begging is the barrier, the mind is the
barrier.</p><p>Whenever there is a prayer which thanks for something, not even for
something but thanks for all that is... Whenever grace is received, you
feel gratitude. On God's part it is grace, on the receiver's end it is
gratitude.</p><p>We have not known gratitude at all. We cannot know unless we know
grace. We cannot be grateful unless we know grace. And this can be
known.</p><p>Do not begin a search, do not begin an inquiry for the divine,
because that is metaphysical and useless. It has been going on for
centuries that the philosophers have been thinking about what are the
attributes of God. So there have been metaphysicians who will say, "This
is an attribute of God and that is not."</p><p>Someone will say he is attributeless -- nirguna. Someone will say he
is with attributes --</p><p>saguna. But how can we know what we have not known ourselves? And how
can we decide whether God is with attributes or without attributes,
whether he is loving or not?</p><p>Just by thinking we are going to decide it? This is not possible.</p><p>So metaphysics will lead us into absurdity. When human imagination
becomes logical, then we think that we have achieved something. We have
not achieved anything.</p><p>Imagination is ours, and logic is ours. We have not known
anything.</p><p>Always begin with yourself if you are to escape from metaphysics. And
if you cannot escape from metaphysics, you cannot be religious.
Metaphysics and religion are opposite pillars. Do not begin with God at
all. Always begin with your mind -- where you are.</p><p>Always begin from there. If you begin from your mind, then something
can be done.</p><p>Then you can know something, then something can be transformed. Then
it is within your capacity to do something. And if your capacity to do
something with yourself is used completely, you will grow, you will
expand, your barrier will be gone, your consciousness will be naked.
Only then can you begin with the divine.</p><p>When you have begun, when you are in contact with the divine, then
you know what grace is, what gratitude is. Grace is that which you feel
showering upon you from everywhere, and gratitude is that which you feel
within your heart, at the center of that space upon which the whole is
showering his love, his compassion, his grace. Only then is it
meaningful to say, "Oh God" or Hare Ram. Otherwise our words are just
words --</p><p>not known from existence, but only learned from language, learned
from the scriptures.</p><p>So I will not say what are the attributes of God. As far as I am
concerned, as far as I know, God has no attributes. But it does not mean
that when we come in contact with him we will not feel his love, we will
not feel his grace. It only means that these are not his attributes,
these are his nature. This is how he happens to be, and he cannot be
otherwise. When you are close to him, when you are just giving back to
him, then too he is the same.</p><p>It is just like light -- your eyes are closed, but the light is still
there. It will not go</p><p>into nonexistence just because your eyes are closed. Open your eyes!
The light is there, it has always been there. Begin with your eyes.</p><p>You can never think anything about light. How can you think? And any
thinking, any contemplating, will be wrong; from the very beginning it
will be wrong. You cannot think, you have not known.</p><p>Thinking about that which is known will go on in circles. It can
never touch the unknown, it can never conceive of the unknown. The
unknown is not for thinking. That is why thinkers will go on denying
God, because he is not known to them. When someone says God is not, it
is not that he is against God, it is only that he is a man who thinks;
it is nothing else. He is not against God, because to be against God
will have to be preceded by knowing him. He is not against God. One who
knows cannot be against. One who has known -- how can he be against? It
only shows that he just goes on thinking. And thinking cannot conceive
of the unknown, so he denies it.</p><p>Do not begin with God. That is a false beginning, it always leads to
nonsense. All metaphysics is nonsense. It goes on thinking about things
about which nothing can be thought. It goes on giving statements about
the existence, about which no statements can be given. Only silence can
be a statement about it.</p><p>But if you begin with yourself, then much that is solid can be said.
If you begin with yourself, then you begin with the right beginning.</p><p>Religion means to begin with oneself, and metaphysics means to begin
with God. So metaphysics is madness -- of course, with a method. All
madmen are metaphysicians without method, and all metaphysicians are mad
but with methodology. Because of their methodology, they seem to be
talking sense, and they go on talking nonsense.</p><p>Begin with yourself. Do not ask whether God exists. Ask whether I
exists. Do not ask whether love is an attribute of the divine. Ask
whether love is an attribute of mine --</p><p>whether "I" have ever loved. Do not ask about grace. Ask whether I
have ever felt gratitude, because that is the pole which is just nearby,
which is just a step from us. We can know it.</p><p>Always begin from the beginning. Never begin from the end, because
then it is</p><p>no beginning at all. One who begins from the beginning always reaches
the end, and one who begins from the end does not even reach the
beginning, because to begin from the end is impossible. You can just go
on and on.</p><p>Make God not a metaphysical notion but a religious experience. Go
inward. He is there always waiting for you. But then you have to do
something with yourself. That doing is meditation; that doing is yoga.
Do something with yourself. As you are, you are closed.</p><p>As you are, you are dead. As you are, you are not in any dialogue --
you cannot be in any dialogue -- with the divine, with the existence. So
transform yourself. Open some doors, break open some spaces, make some
windows, jump outside of your mind, your past.</p><p>And then it is not only that you will know, but you will live. You
will live with the grace of the divine; you live with the love, you will
be part of it, just a ripple of it. And once you have become a ripple of
it, a wave of the divine, only then is there authentic divineness.</p><p>So I am not a metaphysician at all. You can call me an
anti-metaphysician. Religion is existential. Begin from yourself, begin
transforming your aggressive mind. Let it be just receptive.</p><p>I would like to tell you... Buddha tried for six years continuously
to know what the divine is, and it cannot be said that he left anything
undone. He did everything that is humanly possible, even some things
which seem humanly impossible. He did everything.</p><p>Whatever was known up to his day he practiced. Whatever methods were
taught to him, he became a master of them.</p><p>He went to all the gurus that existed in his time, to everyone. And
whatever they could teach, he learned, he practiced. And then he said,
"Anything more, Sir?" And the guru said, "Now you can go, because all
that I could give you I have given, and I cannot say, as I say in other
cases, that you have not practiced. You have practiced. This is all that
I can give." Buddha said, "I have not known the divine yet."</p><p>With each guru this happened. Then he left all the gurus. Then he
invented his own methods. Continuously, for six years, he was in a
struggle of life and death.</p><p>He did everything that could be done. Then, at last, he was so tired
of doing, so deadly tired, that one day when he was taking his evening
bath in the Niranjana River near Bodhgaya, he felt so weak and so tired
that he could not come out of the river. He just clung to a root of a
tree and a thought came to his mind, "I have become so weak, I cannot
even cross this small river. How will I be alive to cross the whole
ocean of the world? I have done everything, and I have not found the
divine. I have only tired my body."</p><p>He felt that he was on the verge of death. At that very moment he
felt that he had done everything, and now there was nothing to do. He
relaxed, and new energy came upon him because of his relaxation. All
that was suppressed through those six years flowered. He came out of the
river, he felt just like a feather, a bird's feather -- weightless. He
relaxed under a Bodhi tree.</p><p>It was a bright fullmoon night. Someone came -- a girl, a shudra girl
named Sujata. The name shows that the girl must have been a shudra
because to have the name Sujata means she has not come from a higher
caste. Sujata means wellborn. She had promised the Bodhi tree to pay it
some homage daily, so she has come with some sweets.</p><p>Buddha is there -- tired, pale, bloodless, but relaxed, absolutely
unburdened -- and it is a fullmoon night with nobody around. The girl,
Sujata, felt that the deity of the tree had come to receive her homage.
Had it been another day, Buddha could have refused. He would not rest in
the night, he would not eat any food. But today he was totally
relaxed.</p><p>He took the food, and he slept. This was the first night after six
years that he really slept.</p><p>He was relaxed with nothing to do. Then there was no worry. There was
no tomorrow even, because tomorrow exists only because one has to do
something. If one has not to do anything, then there is no tomorrow.
Then the moment is enough.</p><p>Buddha slept, and in the morning, at five o'clock, when the last star
was withering away, he was out of the sleep. He saw the last star
disappearing, with no mind, because when you have nothing to do there is
no mind. The mind is just a faculty for doing something, a technical
faculty. No mind, nothing to do, no effort on his part, indifferent to
whether he was alive or dead, he just opened</p><p>his eyes, and he began to dance. He had come to that knowing to which
he could not come through so many efforts.</p><p>Whenever someone would ask him how he achieved, he would say, "The
more I tried to achieve, the more I was at a loss. I could not achieve.
So how can I say I have achieved?</p><p>The more I tried, the more I was involved. I could not achieve. The
mind was trying to transcend itself, which was impossible. It is just
like trying to be a father to yourself, just trying to give birth to
yourself."</p><p>So Buddha would say, "I cannot say I achieved. I can only say I tried
so much that I was annihilated. I tried so much that any effort became
absurd. And the moment came when I was not trying, when the mind was
not, when I was not thinking. Then there was no future because there was
no past. Both were always together. Past is behind, future is in front;
they are always conjoined. If one drops, the other drops simultaneously.
Then there was no future, no past, no mind. I was mindless, I was
I-less. Then something happened, and I cannot say that this something
happened in that moment. I can only say that this was always happening,
only I was not aware. It was always happening, only I was closed.</p><p>So I cannot say I have achieved something."</p><p>Buddha said, "I can only say I have lost something -- the ego, the
mind -- I have not achieved anything at all. Now I know that all that I
have was always there. It was in every layer, it was in every stone, in
every flower, but now I recognize it was always so. Only I was blind. So
I have lost my blindness; I have not achieved anything, I have lost
something."</p><p>If you begin with the divine, then you begin to achieve. If you begin
with yourself, then you begin to lose. Things will begin to disappear,
and ultimately you will disappear. And when you are not, the divine is
-- with all its grace, with all its love, with all its compassion, but
only when you are not.</p><p>Your nonexistence is the categorical condition. For no one can it be
relaxed. It is categorical, it is the absolute. You are the barrier.
Fall down, and then you know. And only when you know, you know. You
cannot understand it, I cannot explain it to you. I cannot make you
understand it. So whatever I am saying, I am not saying anything
metaphysical. I am only trying to show you that you must begin with
yourself.</p><p>If you begin with yourself, you will end with the divine, because
that is your other part, the other pole. But begin from this bank. Do
not begin from the other, where you are not.</p><p>You cannot begin from there. Begin from where you are, and the more
you will go deep, the less you will be.</p><p>The more you will know yourself, the less a self you will be. And
once you have come to total understanding about yourself, you will be
annihilated, you will go into nonexistence, you will be totally negative
-- not. And in that not, in that total negation, you will know the grace
which is always falling, which is always raining down from eternity. You
will know the love which is always around you. It has always been, but
you have not paid any attention to it. Be annihilated, and you will be
aware of it.</p><p>I Am the Gate Chapter #5</p><p>Chapter title: Meditation and the paths to inner awakening 28 April
1971 pm in Bombay, India</p><p>Archive code:</p><p>7104285</p><p>ShortTitle: GATE05</p><p>Audio:</p><p>Yes Video: No Question 1</p><p>BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>HOW DOES MEDITATION REALLY WORK? HOW CAN ONE ACHIEVE A CONSTANT
MEDITATIVE STATE? AND IN WHAT WAY DOES KUNDALINI PRACTICE RELATE TO
MEDITATION?</p><p>Meditation is an adventure, an adventure into the unknown -- the
greatest adventure that the human mind can take. And by adventure I mean
that you cannot be cultivated in it.</p><p>First, you cannot know anything beforehand. Unless you know it, you
cannot know it.</p><p>Everything said ultimately means nothing: truth remains unsaid. Much
has been said, much has been said about nothing; however, not a single
word of truth has been uttered.</p><p>Unless you know it, you cannot know it. But something about it can be
indicated. It will never be to the point, it cannot be. The nature of
the thing is such that this is impossible.</p><p>You cannot say that this is meditation. All that is possible is to
say that this is not meditation, this is not meditation, that is not
meditation. The remaining is. And the remaining is left unindicated.</p><p>Many reasons for it are there. Meditation is something greater than
the mind. It is not something which happens in the mind. It is something
which happens to the mind, not in the mind; otherwise the mind will be
capable of defining it, the mind will be capable of knowing it,
understanding it. It is not something happening in the mind, but to the
mind.</p><p>The happening is just like death happens to life. Death never happens
in life, it happens to life.</p><p>Meditation is just like death to the mind, as death is to life. We
can say that meditation is a deeper death -- not physical, but psychic.
The deeper the death, the deeper is the possibility to be reborn. When
there is physical death, you will be reborn physically. As far as you
are concerned, nothing will have happened at all, nothing. You will
remain the same -- the same continuity, the same old one.</p><p>The deeper the death, the deeper is the resurrection. If you die
psychologically, if the mind dies, then you are reborn. And this rebirth
is not just like physical</p><p>rebirth, because then the body is replaced; a new one replaces it.
But when there is mental, psychic death, the mind is not replaced.
Consciousness remains without the mind.</p><p>So meditation is consciousness without the mind -- an open sky
without any walls around it. We can destroy the walls of this house, but
not the room, becausÃ¨room' means nothing but space. So now the room will
be the roomness. The room will be there under the open sky. Of course
you will no longer see it as the room, because now you cannot define it,
it has become one with the sky. But the room is there more than before,
only the walls are not. So if you define the room as the roomness, the
emptiness between the walls, then without the walls the room will still
be there. It will have become greater, infinite.</p><p>So as the mind dies -- when I say the mind dies, I only mean the
walls of the mind -- the emptiness within this space remains, becomes
greater. That is consciousness. Make a distinction. I call the emptiness
within, consciousness, and the walls around it the mind.</p><p>Or you can say it like this: mind with a small `m' dies, mind with a
capital `M' goes on living. Then it is not your mind, it cannot be
yours. If these walls are removed, this room will not be mind. The room
will be there, but it will not be mind, because mind can only be the
walls, mind can only be the limitations. This pure emptiness cannot be
mind. So then the mind with a small `m' dies, and the mind with a
capital `M' is there; you are not there. And you are not replaced by any
other mind, you are not replaced at all.</p><p>So meditation is a subtle death -- a deep death of you, your mind,
your ego, of all that makes you defined. But that which is within is
there. That is pure consciousness.</p><p>So firstly, the walls of the mind, the mental processes, are not
meditation, they are obstacles. What are walls of the mind? How has the
mind defined itself? How has it become a limited thing? Where are the
boundaries, the walls, due to which the mind has become separated from
the Mind?</p><p>There are three things: the first is memory. The greater part of the
mind is memory. And this memory is a long one, it goes back to all the
infinite lives that you have lived. The mind accumulates everything, not
only that which you have collected consciously. When you are asleep the
mind is collecting. When you are</p><p>even in a coma, completely unconscious, the mind is collecting. The
mind goes on collecting. Nothing escapes it. The unconscious mind is a
great Chinese wall of memories -- a very long one.</p><p>This memory is not only a part of your brain, but in fact a part of
each and every cell of your being, of each and every cell of your body.
That is why twenty-four cells from the male and twenty-four cells from
the female begin to create you. They have a built-in program, they have
a built-in memory. One day we will be capable of knowing what type of a
nose you will have even when you are in the womb the first day. The new
egg will indicate what type of eyes you will have, how great will be
your age, how much intelligence, how much ego.</p><p>That so simple looking cell is as complex as you are. It is all the
memories of the whole race. It carries on the collective mind. And then
your soul, your ego, your mind, penetrates in it. So the body has its
own memories, and your mind has its own. You are a crossroads -- a mind
with so many memories, and a body with so many memories of the whole
collective race, the whole collective mind. Bodily memories are stronger
than the mind. So you always are a victim to them. Howsoever you may
think against them, when the moment comes the body wins. Your mind is
nothing before it, because it is a racial mind. That is why all the
religions fell in a trap when they began to fight the body. You cannot
fight it. If you begin to fight it, you will only be wasting your
life.</p><p>You cannot fight with the body because, in fact, it is the race --
not only the race, it is the whole history of the being itself. Things
go on living in you. Everything that has existed goes on living in you
body. Your own self carries everything within it. That is why a child in
the womb has to pass through all those stages through which the human
being passes in evolution.</p><p>Those nine months in the womb are total evolution compressed. One
begins just as an amoeba, the first primitive cell. One begins just in
the same situation as the amoeba had to begin in sea water. The womb
contains the same chemical conditions as the sea water.</p><p>The womb water in which the cell swims has the same components as the
sea water, exactly the same.</p><p>In the womb the evolution begins again. Of course, it is a miniature
evolution. But the whole thing has to begin again, because the cell has
a memory, it cannot</p><p>work otherwise.</p><p>It will go again through the same process. The time will be short.
The amoeba had to pass millions of years, then it was able to come on
the earth from the sea. This cell, this egg cell within the womb, will
pass within a week. But in those seven days there will be the same
evolution, compressed from millions of years, and the same stages. These
nine months are compressed evolution, and the cell has a built-in
program.</p><p>So in a way your body is the whole evolution. In a very compressed
atomic state the body has a memory of its own. One who desires or longs
to be in meditation will first have to understand his body memory, the
physiological memory. Do not fight with it. If you begin fighting you
are taking the wrong step. You will be more and more disturbed. Be
cooperative, there is no other way. Let the body be completely at ease.
Do not create any tension between you and the body. Your real fight is
not with the body, not with the body memory but with ego memory -</p><p>- your psyche, your mind. And that is another thing, completely
different. So do not fight with the body.</p><p>When we fight with the body, we never have time to fight with the
mind. And if we begin to fight with the body, it will go on and on. It
will be suicidal, it will be destructive, it will just sow seeds of its
own defeat. One is bound to be defeated -</p><p>- a single cell fighting the whole humanity, fighting the whole being
as such; that is impossible.</p><p>So do not take bodily memories as your memories. For example, hunger
is a body memory. You can fight with it, but to win will be very
difficult, very arduous, nearly impossible. If you win, your victory
will be your total defeat, because if you can win over your hunger you
have taken a suicidal step. Within ninety days you will be dead. Even
the body will not indicate to you that now is the time to feed it. So it
is good that you never win over it, otherwise it will be suicidal. Then
between you and your body memories there will be no bridge. That is the
only way to win -- but you are not winning really, you are going to
murder yourself.</p><p>So there are methods which can break the bridge between you and your
body. There are methods, so many hatha yoga methods to break the bridge.
The body goes on crying hunger, hunger, hunger... but you never know,
the bridge is broken. The body goes on, but you never know about it, you
become insensitive</p><p>to it. Never practice anything which makes your body or you
insensitive, because meditation is total sensitivity.</p><p>When you become meditative, your body will become so sensitive -- you
cannot conceive now how sensitive the body organs can be. We never hear
exactly, we never see exactly -</p><p>- just so-so. You pass through a garden, you seem to be looking but
you just look, you do not see. The eyes have become insensitive, you
have been fighting with the eyes. The body has become insensitive, you
have been fighting the body.</p><p>The whole culture is against the body -- this whole culture, wherever
it is, East or West, it makes no difference. The culture that has
developed on this planet is, in a way, diseased.</p><p>It is against the body, and the body is a great mystery. If you go
against the body, then in a way you have gone against the universe; it
is a miniature universe. Your relationship to the universe, your bridge
to the universe, your instruments to the universe, are all through the
body. Your body is just a midway station.</p><p>So do not fight with the body. Always make a clear distinction of
what is the body memory and what is the mind memory. Hunger is the body
memory, and you can know it. But the mind has its own memories also.
They are not existential; they have no survival value, in fact. Body
memories have a survival value, and that is the basic distinction. If
you deny the body memories, if you fight against them, you will not
survive. But psychological memories have no survival value really. They
are simply waste accumulation -- something which is to be thrown if you
have accumulated it, something which needs to be thrown. You have only
burdened yourself with it. And these mind memories are long.</p><p>Whenever you are in anger, there are two possibilities: it may be a
body memory, it may be a mind memory. A certain distinction is to be
made between them. If your anger has a survival value, if you cannot
survive without it, then it has a bodily medium, But if your anger has
no survival value, then it is just a habit of the mind, just a
mechanical repetition of the mind. Then it is a mind memory. You have
been angry so many times, it has become a conditioning with you.
Whenever someone just pushes you, just pushes the button, you are angry
again. So be aware.</p><p>One who is never mentally angry, not habitually angry... his bodily
anger will have a beauty of its own. It will never be ugly. Then it will
only mean that someone is living, not dead. But the more you are
habitually angry, the less will be your capacity to be bodily angry, and
your anger will be just ugly. It will not add anything to you, it will
just be disturbing to yourself and to others.</p><p>We can understand it from another route also, for example, sex. It
can be a bodily memory, then it has a survival value. But it can be just
cerebral, mental, just out of habit.</p><p>Then it has no survival value. And one who has become trapped in the
habitual pattern, his sex will become an ugly thing. Neither will it
have any love, nor will it have any beauty. Neither will it have any
music, nor will it have any deeper response. The more cerebral the sex,
the less your body will be capable. You will think about it more, and
you will not be able to know what it is exactly, what is its deepest
mystery. The mind will go on thinking about sex, and the body will have
to follow the mind. And whenever the body follows the mind, there is no
life in it; it is just dragged along as a dead weight.</p><p>It may be anything -- sex or anger or greed. Always make a
distinction as to whether it has a survival value, then you do not have
to fight with it. If it is just a mental habit, then be aware of it.
This mental memory of all our past actions has become a conditioned
thing. You go on repeating them, you act just like a machine. Be
conscious of this. You will be surprised to know, if there is no mind in
your anger and if it is just a total response to a situation with the
whole body in it and no mental preconditioning, then there will be no
repentance. You have acted totally in the situation, as the situation
required. Then there need be no repentance at all.</p><p>Another thing: when there is no repentance, there will be no
psychological accumulation.</p><p>Nothing will be a habit with you. You need not accumulate anything.
Why does the mind need to accumulate memories? Because it is not
confident whether it can act totally in a situation. It prepares, it has
to go through so many rehearsals. If there is such and such a situation,
it is not confident of what it will do. It must know all of what
happened, it must sort things out, it must make programs of what is to
be done in a particular situation. That is why the mind accumulates
memories, and the more it accumulates, the less is your capacity to act
totally.</p><p>And the less your capacity to act totally, the more the mind will be
needed.</p><p>So act with the body, do not act with the mind. This will look
strange, like something never expected from a religious man -- act from
the body. Then the act is immeasurable, the response is total. Do not
let your mind come in. Then there will be no memory, there will be no
mental accumulation, there will be no repentance. The act is just over.
Things were such, the situation was such, you acted totally with no part
remaining behind. So no one can repent. You were total to it. Otherwise,
the part that is withheld repents later on.</p><p>The body can act totally; the mind can never act totally. Mind is
always divided, mind works in dichotomies. So one part of the mind is
angry, another part is simultaneously repenting or preparing to repent.
This should also be noted -- whenever there is a part constantly against
another part, know that you are acting through the mind not through the
body. The body is always total; it cannot act dividedly. The body is
just a flow, there are no divisions. When you fall in love, it is the
whole body which has fallen in love. You cannot make any distinction
such as that the head has fallen or that the hands begin to love. The
whole body is in it, but the mind can never be totally in anything. A
part of it will always be criticizing, judging, commanding,
appreciating; a part of it will always be sitting in the chair to judge,
to condemn. So whenever you see that some part of your mind is working
against the act, you know that you are doing it cerebrally,
mentally.</p><p>Begin to do things bodily. When you are eating, eat bodily. The body
knows well when to stop, but the mind never knows. One part will go on
eating and another part will go on condemning. One part will go on
saying stop, and another part will go on eating. The body is total, so
ask the body. Do not ask the mind whether to eat or not to eat, to stop
or not to stop. Your body knows what is needed. It has accumulated the
wisdom of centuries and centuries. It knows when to stop.</p><p>Do not ask the mind, ask the body. Rely on the body's wisdom. The
body is more wise than you. That is why animals live more wisely than
us. They live more wisely, but, of course, they do not think. The moment
they think they will be just like us: This is a miracle: that animals
can live more wisely than human beings. It seems absurd. They know
nothing, but they go on living more wisely. The only ability in which
the human being has become efficient is to interfere with everything.
You go on interfering with you body. Do not interfere, let the body</p><p>work. Do not come in its way, and then you will have a clear
distinction of what is mental memory and what is body memory.</p><p>Memory in the body is a help to survive; mental memory is
obstructive. This mental memory is to be destroyed. When I say
destroyed, I do not mean that you will not remember anything. In fact,
when I say to destroy the memory, I mean that you should not be
identified with the memory, you should not become one with it. The
memory must not be an autonomous affair, it must not perpetuate
itself.</p><p>It goes on perpetuating. You are sitting, and the memory is working.
You are sleeping, and the memory is working. You are working, and the
memory is working. The memory goes on continuously working. What is it
doing? What can memory do? It can only desire the same for the future.
It can do nothing else. It can perpetuate and project itself into the
future: "All that has been should be again, or something that has been
should not be."</p><p>The memory is always weaving a pattern for the future around you. And
once you allow it to weave a pattern for you, you will never be free.
You will always be in a pattern. That pattern constitutes the walls
around the emptiness of consciousness. Before you take one step into the
future, memory has taken many. The path is not an open path, it has
become an imprisonment. The memory is always narrowing it down. But we
are deceived by it because we think that the memory is helping us to
live the future better. It is not helping.</p><p>It is just helping you to make your future the same as the past.</p><p>The memory cannot project anything which it has not known. It can
only project the known: it will project it. Do not fall into the trap.
Do not allow the mind to project for the future even for a moment. Of
course, it will take time to be without this dead habit. To begin to be
aware of it is meditation. And once you are aware, completely aware,
intensely aware, alert, the memory will not weave the future for you; it
can only weave when you are dreaming.</p><p>To be dreaming is a basic condition for the memory to work. That is
why, in sleep, it creates real looking dreams -- more real looking than
the reality. When you are just sitting in your easy chair, then there
are day dreams, there are reveries. Just be a little sleepy, and the
memory begins to weave, begins to project. Be alert, conscious, and the
memory stops working for the future.</p><p>Alertness, more alertness within and without, is the beginning of
meditation.</p><p>This alertness can be created in so many ways. By telling you to be
alert I know that you are not going to become alert. You will hear this
in a dreaming state, and the memory will project: "Yes, I will be alert
tomorrow." And the memory will work upon this and make it a project. If
you hear this, "Be alert," you will make it a project. You will say,</p><p>"Yes, I will be alert sometime." And if I say that happiness follows
alertness, if I say that bliss is bound to come to you through
alertness, you will be more dreamy. And the memory will project
events.</p><p>Only telling you to be alert will not make you meditative; it will
not make any difference.</p><p>So I create devices, I create situations, in which you cannot help
but be alert, situations in which dreaminess is impossible.</p><p>I will tell you something.â¦ Dreaminess becomes more possible if there
is more carbon dioxide around you; you will be more dreamy. That is why
in the day you cannot be so dreamy as in the night. The chemical
components change. At night there is more carbon dioxide in the air and
the oxygen is less. So if the reverse is possible, if the oxygen in you
and around you is more and carbon dioxide is thrown out, you cannot be
dreamy. That is why I insist on vigorous breathing. It is nothing but a
chemical device to change the chemical atmosphere in you. Oxygen must be
there more and more. The more the oxygen, the less you fall victim to
the dream. And your memories cannot work without the medium of
dreaminess.</p><p>In the morning we feel freshness. What happens in the morning with
the rising sun? The carbon dioxide decreases and the oxygen increases.
So the same chemical change is needed within you. The technique which we
are using in our meditation camps nowadays is the most powerful method
to create excess oxygen in the body. And after the first three stages,
in the fourth, the student becomes charged with tremendous life energy
that makes him very alert.</p><p>Another device to make you alert is kundalini practice. It is a
system to transform sex energy for meditation and awareness. It is
useful to a person whose sex energy can be easily and naturally
channeled for meditation purposes. In the days of the Vedas and
Upanishads, in ancient India, the people were</p><p>simple and natural and they could easily convert their sex energy.
For them sex was not a mental problem at all, it was not at all a
problem. Once it is a problem, it becomes mental.</p><p>Today, the modern world is so sexually perverse and sexually
exploited that kundalini --</p><p>the movement of psychic energy in a particular psychic channel -- has
become difficult.</p><p>But through this method, sometimes the kundalini is felt to be
rising. That is another thing. If someone feels his kundalini rising,
then I begin to work on his kundalini, then I begin to give him
techniques for working on it. But unless there is a spontaneous feeling
of kundalini, I will not even touch the point. I will not talk about it.
You can by-pass it, and this age is such that you will have to by- pass
it. Only with natural, physical sex, with no mind in it, can kundalini
work -- with innocent minds it can work.</p><p>Somewhere on the way, when you have gone deeper in meditation, your
mind loses its grip. As I have said to you, when you go deeper in
meditation, then you make a distinction and separation of these two
memories, then you become less and less mental about the body and let
the body function by itself through its own wisdom.</p><p>Then sometimes kundalini will become active. So if it works
automatically, then it is good. I won't allow its practice directly.
Indirectly, it comes to work itself. And it comes so many times. At
least thirty to forty percent of people working on this method feel
kundalini. When they feel it, then I am ready. Then they can proceed.
Then through this method they proceed through the door of kundalini. But
this method is only indirectly connected to kundalini, not directly.</p><p>As far as I am concerned there is no future for direct kundalini
methods, unless the whole world takes sex as a natural phenomenon. And
there are no kundalini techniques that are used before sex maturity.
Unless the track for kundalini is created within you before sex
maturity, there is every possibility -- even if sex is taken naturally
-- that you may not turn out to be a pervert, but you will turn out to
be just an animal.</p><p>I will tell you a story from the Upanishads.â¦</p><p>A rishi is sitting with his wife and son. A man passes by there and
he falls in love with the wife. He asks her to accompany him to his
residence. The wife goes away with the man. There is no criticism or
objection from the rishi, but the son becomes angry and he says to his
father, "This is just animalistic. This is just like animals do. This
cannot be allowed. When I will make a moral code, I will not allow this.
This is just like animals do." The father says, "This is not just like
animals do. But on the contrary, your rage, your anger, is just like
animals do. It is a projection of moral violence, just like an
animal.</p><p>In fact no animal will allow what just happened, he will fight. No
animal will hold on to a possession forever."</p><p>This attitude, the father's attitude, is really a higher one. It
cannot be understood. He says your attitude is just like an animal's.
Animals fight for their mates. They have a territorial possessive sense.
And if you trespass it, they will fight. But the father says, "I am
human.</p><p>If someone sees your mother and falls in love, no one is at fault.
And if your mother is ready, who am I? I have also fallen in love with
her the same way. It makes no difference. Just like this I have fallen
in love with her. She agreed to be married, she agreed to be my wife,
but not my possession. Someone else has fallen. I know human weakness
because I know myself, I have also fallen myself. So nothing wrong is
happening. And I am not an animal, so I cannot fight for this. I know he
is a human being just like me. And your mother is beautiful. I have also
fallen in love with her."</p><p>But this is a very high morality, and this can only be cultivated
before sex maturity, if you have trained -- otherwise not. After sex
maturity you will not be able to channel the energy; it is very
difficult. But if channels are ready before, then the energy just flows
in them as naturally as it flows in sex. And this man, this father, this
rishi, must have known kundalini otherwise he could not have been as he
was. It is impossible. This rishi had kundalini development -- energy
going upward -- otherwise this attitude would never come.</p><p>Downward energy is always toward violence. Upward energy is always
toward love, understanding, compassion.</p><p>So this method is an indirect method. It works through so many doors.
If your kundalini can be used, the method will use it. It will take its
route, it is flexible.</p><p>The method is absolutely flexible. If your kundalini is ready and
cannot use it, if it is dangerous, it will not use it. Then there are
other channels, other routes. It can use other routes.</p><p>Those other routes are not named, because no ancient teaching used
them. But there are other routes. Mahavira never talked about kundalini,
never. Buddha never talked about kundalini, never. Christ never knew
about it, Lao Tse never heard about it. They had been through other
routes.</p><p>The way Buddha went could not have been through kundalini. His sex
had become absolutely a boredom to him, he was not in the least
interested in sex. And that was bound to happen, because his father
arranged for him so many beautiful girls of his kingdom. Every girl who
was beautiful was in his palace. He just became disgusted. It was bound
to happen; everyone would become disgusted like that. He became so
disgusted with sex that he could not conceive that the same energy could
be converted.</p><p>He never tried for it. And even if someone had said to him that sex
energy can become divine energy, he would not have listened to him,
because he had known sex so much, and there was nothing divine about it
to him. It was just carnal. Buddha used another route. He did not talk
about kundalini at all, but he talked about centers, chakras. He worked
for chakras.</p><p>If you work for kundalini, then there is a gradual process. Kundalini
is a continuity, it has a continuity just like a thermometer. It rises
just like a thermometer, slowly, slowly. The passage is a continuous
one. Buddha never used that passage, but he talked about chakras working
in sudden jumps. From one chakra one jumps to another. There is no
continuity, one just jumps. Because of this jumping process, Buddha
conceived of the whole world in a very new way. He said that there is no
continuity in the world, only jumps.</p><p>Nothing is continuous. The flower is not continuous with the bud; the
flower is a jump.</p><p>Youth is not a continuity of childhood; it is a jump. And so Buddhist
philosophers nowadays are very happy, because today science also says
that there is no continuity.</p><p>Everything jumps, there is just a jump. We see continuity only
because we cannot see the gaps between.</p><p>You see this light continuously; it is not continuous. Electrons are
jumping, but the gaps are so small that your eyes cannot know them. It
is not continuous; it is jumping. But the jumps are so speedily taken
that when one electric particle is dead and the other has come, the gap
in between is not noticed. There is just a sudden jump. You light the
flame in the evening, and in the morning when you put it out, you will
think that you are putting out the same flame. The flame has jumped
thousands and thousands of times. It has gone, evaporated, and the new
one has come. But it looks so continuous.</p><p>Heraclitus said that you can never step twice in the same river.
Because the river is flowing, you can never step in it twice. Buddha
will say you cannot step even once because the river is flowing. As soon
as you have touched the surface, it is gone. Before you have gone
deeper, it is gone again. Even one step, and so many rivers have
gone.</p><p>And it is always a jumping process.</p><p>This jumping concept came to Buddha because he never passed through
kundalini. He passed through a jump, one chakra to another. So he talks
about seven chakras, that also is possible. I can come to your house
jumping, so I touch only some points. The gaps are there, there is no
continuity.</p><p>Mahavira never talks about chakras or jumps, he talks of explosions.
You are this, and then you are that. There are not even many stations to
jump. This is another route --</p><p>explosion, you just explode. One moment before you are this, and one
moment after you are that. There is neither a continuity nor a jump,
there is an explosion. There is no midpoint to be crossed.</p><p>In Zen, there are two sects: one sect is known as the sudden school
of Zen; the other is the gradual school of Zen. But even gradual Zen
does not talk about kundalini. It has used another route. So there is no
talk about kundalini in Zen, not even in the gradual school; another
route was used.</p><p>The body has so many routes. It is a great world in itself. You can
work through breathing, and through breathing you can take the jump. You
can work through sex, and through sex you can take the jump. You can
work through awareness -- that is, directly through consciousness -- and
you can take the jump. This working directly on consciousness has been
one of the deepest routes, but even</p><p>one single route can be used in so many ways. You must understand the
complexity of this.</p><p>For example, one road can be used in so many ways. One can use it
with a car, another with a cart, and another by just walking. The route
is the same, but the method is absolutely different. What is common
between walking and sitting in a car? Nothing is common. In the car you
are just sitting and not doing at all. You are not doing anything.</p><p>So someone can say, "I passed this route just sitting," and he is not
saying anything false.</p><p>But one who has only walked and who has never known how one can pass
the route only sitting will deny this route. He too is right.</p><p>Even a single route can be used in different ways, for example,
awareness. Gurdjieff uses it, but he will call it remembering, and the
method is different. The route is the same.</p><p>Consciousness is to be used, but as remembering, not as awareness.
And what is the difference? Remembering means you are on this street,
just remember you are. Stand for a moment, remember you are. Look around
completely remembering that you are. Never forget for a single moment
that you are.</p><p>But we forget, we never remember. If I see you, I forget myself and I
see you. The awareness becomes one arrowed, the other arrow is not
there. Gurdjieff says to make it double arrowed. You are listening to a
discourse. To listen to what the speaker says is the first arrow, and if
you are aware of yourself -- of the listener -</p><p>- then that is the second arrow. Do not forget yourself when you are
listening, remember that you are listening.</p><p>Someone is speaking, and you are listening; be beyond both and
remember. Make yourself double arrowed. The route is the same, but the
method is different.</p><p>Krishnamurti will say, "Do not remember this way, it will become a
tense effort. Just be aware of the totality. Do not choose that you are
here and he is there. Do not choose. Just let there be an all-inclusive
awareness. Do not focus it -- unfocused awareness." I am speaking; you
are sitting; the horn is there; the car is passing... Things are -- and
awareness is unfocused. Do not make it arrowed,</p><p>make it unfocused. The route is the same, but the method is quite
different.</p><p>Tantra used the same method, the same route, in a different way. It
was unimaginable.</p><p>They used intoxicants -- bhang, charas, ganja, wine. And the method
was this: take the intoxicant, and be aware. Do not lose awareness. Go
on taking the intoxicant, and be aware that you are aware. Do not lose
consciousness. There are methods in which no intoxicant will be of any
effect, so snake poison was used. The snake is made to bite on the
tongue. And when the snake bites on the tongue and you are still aware,
only then have you taken the jump -- otherwise not. The route is the
same, but the method is quite different.</p><p>In this Tantra practice, if no intoxicants work and you go on
remaining conscious, you behave consciously, then something has
crystallized within you. Something has gone beyond body chemistry.
Otherwise the chemistry will affect you. Now you are beyond chemistry.
The chemistry is somewhere working in the body, but you are aloof, it
cannot touch you.</p><p>So there are so many routes, and each route can be used with so many
methods. My method is not directly concerned with any route. It is just
like a vehicle which can fly, swim and go on the road. Whatever is the
need of your personality, the need will change the method, the route.
You may call it a multi- method. It is indirect, it cannot be direct. I
give you the method; your body, your being, will give the route. And the
awakened energy can use any route: Tantric, Buddhist, Jain, Gurdjieff's,
Sufi... it can use any route.</p><p>And when I say this, it is not just a hypothesis. When I say this I
have worked so.</p><p>People have come to me who have worked on different routes. When they
use this method, it begins to help them in their route. If someone is
working on kundalini and comes to me, then works with this method, it
helps him on his own route. He says, "This method is wonderful; the
previous kundalini method was not working so intensely and so intently."
And this is not a kundalini method at all. But this is flexible. The
method will find out the route. You are to do it, and all else will be
done by the method itself.</p><p>And for the coming world, and also for today's world, only such
flexible methods can be used because there are so many types of people
now. In the old</p><p>world, that was not the case. In a particular region, a particular
type existed. If there were Hindus, there were only Hindus, there were
no Moslems. In fact, they never heard about one another. They never knew
about each other's practices, so they were never confused. They were of
a single type. If they were Tibetan Buddhists, they were Tibetan
Buddhists; they never heard about anything else. Everyone's conditioning
was the same, everyone was brought up in the same milieu. So one method
was needed that worked.</p><p>Now that is all difficult. Minds are confused; in fact, there is no
single type. Everyone is a multi-type. There are so many influences,
contradictory influences. All religions say, "Do not study others. Do
not go to other teachers." That is not simply dogmatism. It looks like
it is dogmatic, it was basically just to protect their type. This led to
unnecessary confusion. Otherwise, no method would be used fully --
neither that nor this. This was done so that one should not be confused,
but now that is impossible.</p><p>But now everyone is confused, and there is no help. Now there can be
no single type, and a type cannot be protected. So we need new methods
which belong to no type and can be used by every type. So this method is
flexible. I am not particularly concerned with kundalini, not
particularly concerned with anything, but deeply concerned with all.</p><p>You use this method, and the method will find the route -- the route
which can be worked out in you. I leave this to the method. The method
finds it, and it finds it more exactly than you can find it. But this
finding is unconscious. It just puts you in a situation, just like there
is fire in the house. You are in a situation. If you can run, run. If
you can jump, jump. The situation is there, and the situation will push
you toward whatever is possible for you.</p><p>And the unconscious mind always chooses the route of least
resistance. That is necessarily the mathematics, the inner economy of
mind. You never unconsciously choose any long route, you always choose
the shortest. Only with the conscious mind do you begin to choose routes
which lead nowhere or are so much longer that you are dead before you
reach. But the unconscious always chooses the shortest route. So this
method will create the situation, and your unconscious will take the
route which is potentially its type.</p><p>I Am the Gate</p><p>Chapter #6</p><p>Chapter title: The secrets of spiritual explosion 8 June 1971 pm in
Bombay, India</p><p>Archive code:</p><p>7106085</p><p>ShortTitle:</p><p>GATE06</p><p>Audio:</p><p>Yes Video: No Question 1</p><p>BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>YOU HAVE SAID THAT WHENEVER THE ULTIMATE SPIRITUAL EXPLOSION</p><p>HAPPENS TO A PERSON, THERE THEN STARTS AROUND HIM A PROCESS OF</p><p>SPIRITUAL EXPLOSION WHICH EFFECTS OTHER SEEKERS LIKE A CHAIN</p><p>REACTION. SO PLEASE TELL US WHETHER A CHAIN REACTION OF</p><p>SPIRITUAL EXPLOSION HAS STARTED AROUND YOU? ARE THERE PERSONS</p><p>WHO HAVE UNDERGONE A HIGHER SPIRITUAL EXPLOSION? ARE</p><p>THERE</p><p>PERSONS NEAR YOU PHYSICALLY WHO ARE GOING TO EXPLODE IN THE</p><p>VERY NEAR FUTURE?</p><p>First, one has to understand what is meant by spiritual explosion.
Many things are implied. One, the explosion is something for which you
cannot do anything directly.</p><p>Your efforts are meaningless, it is not something that you can
manage. Explosion happens to you. You cannot do anything positive to
make explosion happen, because if the explosion is done by you, it will
not be an explosion at all. You will remain, and you will continue. Even
after the explosion you will be there. If you have attained it, then you
will not explode in it. So positively no effort is possible toward
explosion; this is the first thing, the first basic implication in
explosion.</p><p>Explosion means a discontinuity with the past. The old has gone
completely, and the new has come. There is no continuity between the
two. This new is not connected with the old. There is no causal link, it
is not caused by the old. If it is caused by the old, then there is no
explosion. Then there is continuity, the old has continued in a new
form. Then you may have gained something, you may have added something
to yourself. But you are the same, the central being remains the same.
Only on the periphery has something been added and accumulated. Your ego
becomes more strengthened, stronger than before; you will be richer. So
there is no explosion in continuity.</p><p>Explosion means the old has died completely and the new has come into
being. There is no causal link between the two. There is a gap -- an
unbridgeable gap, an abyss. Then you can call it explosion. This is very
difficult to understand. In our lives everything is easy to understand,
everything is causal. Our whole logical thinking is based on causality;
everything is connected, everything is related and is in continuity with
something else.</p><p>Nothing is new, everything is just a modification of the old -- so it
can be understood.</p><p>This is because the mind is the continuity. The mind is filled with
accumulated</p><p>knowledge, with memory. The mind can always understand the old, but
the new is incomprehensible to it. The new cannot be understood by the
mind. And if your mind tries to understand the new, it will transform it
into terms of the past. It will give shape to it, meaning to it, and
will categorize it. If things are connected with the old, then the mind
is at ease because it can understand.</p><p>Explosion is something which cannot be understood by the mind.
Really, in explosion, the mind explodes and is thrown out completely. So
the second thing to be understood is this: you will not be able to
understand explosion. All that you understand will not be explosion. You
will change something into something old which is known. You may think
that what I am talking about is like any other explosion, but spiritual
explosion is not similar to any other phenomenon.</p><p>If a bomb explodes, everything is destroyed. The old order is gone,
and there is chaos.</p><p>But this chaos is caused by the old; it is a continuity. Nothing new
has come into being.</p><p>This whole chaos, this whole disorder, is just a continuity with the
old order. It is the old in a disordered way. No material explosion can
even be symbolic or used metaphorically for spiritual explosion. The
word comes from a material happening and has a connotation which is
quite misleading. Spiritual explosion does not mean that the old is
disordered, that the old has become chaotic. Spiritual explosion means
something new is created, something new has come into being.</p><p>Material explosion is destructive. Spiritual explosion is creative.
But if we try to understand it by analogy, then we will not be able to
know it. Something new, something quite new, comes into being. You
cannot give it meaning because you are the old. You cannot create it.
You have just to be vacant. You can only help it negatively by your
absence, by your not being. If you are absent, then the explosion will
take place. Your cooperation is needed only in a negative way. But to do
something positively is easy, to do something negatively is very
arduous.</p><p>To cooperate is easy, not to cooperate is easy; but to cooperate
negatively is very difficult. To cooperate negatively means not to
create hindrances. And we all go on creating hindrances for the new to
come into being. We always emphasize the</p><p>old, we always stick with the old, are identified with the old. The
old is really the "we", the "I".</p><p>When I say the "I", it is the total past. So how can "I" help the
new? How can "I" help the future, "I" being the past? Whenever you say
"I", it is the whole past in a single word. All that is dead now, all
that must be buried now, stands behind this "I". So this "I" becomes the
hindrance, the only obstacle, the only obstruction, for the new to come
in.</p><p>So you cannot do anything with the "I" positively, but negatively you
can do something.</p><p>Understand that you are the old, and let this understanding go deep,
penetrate you to your innermost depth. Become completely aware that you
cannot help the new to come into being. Unless the new comes in, there
is no spirituality. Unless the new explodes, you will not be reborn, you
will not be in the dimension of the divine.</p><p>It is not that "I" am to be freed; rather, there will be freedom from
the I, freedom from myself. It is not that I am to do something; rather,
I must not do anything so that this phenomenon can happen. But we
continue to do something or other.</p><p>This comes out of</p><p>"me"; it prolongs, it continues "me." It projects "me" into the
future, and there can be no explosion.</p><p>The dead past, which accumulates like dust, goes on accumulating on
my mirror- like consciousness, and the mirror-like consciousness is lost
and only the dust is there. We become identified with the dust. Can you
imagine yourself without your past? If your total past is destroyed,
where will you live? What will you do then? Who will you be? If
everything from the past is taken away, by and by you will feel you are
disintegrating and disappearing.</p><p>When there is no past, who are you? Where are you? With what then
will you be identified? If there is no past, still you exist, but not
the same way. Really, you will be diametrically opposite to that which
you were. If the whole past is taken away, you will be just a
consciousness. Then you cannot be an ego.</p><p>The ego is the accumulated events, the past. If it is taken away from
you, then you will be just like a mirror, mirroring everything with a
new identity. If you</p><p>become aware that you are the hindrance, then you do not have to do
anything. This very awareness will destroy the old identity. And when
the old identity is completely destroyed, when there is a gap between
your real being and your memories, when there is a space between your
ego and you, then within that space the explosion comes in. Within that
space is the explosion.</p><p>This explosion cannot be comprehended intellectually in any way
whatsoever. The more you will try to understand it, the less you will
understand it. So do not be tense about it, just be relaxed. And do not
try to understand me, but rather feel inside yourself what I am saying.
If I say you are the past, then do not just hear my words and think
whether they are right or wrong. Just go in and feel whatever is being
said. Think in terms of fact. They are facts.</p><p>Go inside, and see whether you are the past, whether what I am saying
is really a fact.</p><p>Have you anything more than the past? Are you the dead past or is
there something living in you which is not part and parcel of the past?
What is that? You cannot confine it to yourself, because the "I" is the
confinement. As the past is limited, you can confine it.</p><p>The past can be confined, it has happened, it is finite. But when you
become aware of something in you which is not of the past, but is the
here and now, then even if the whole past is destroyed, it will still
be.</p><p>If there is something in you which will not be destroyed by the
destruction of the past, but will continue to be, it is just a
mirror-like consciousness -- pure consciousness. Then</p><p>"you" are not in it, but you are just a mirror which mirrors
everything. Then you will feel the gap between your ego and you, you
will feel the space. And if you can remain in this understanding and in
this awareness, then it becomes a meditation. If you can just remain in
this understanding and awareness, in this space between your real being
-- your consciousness -- and your past, then the accumulated being, the
ego, becomes just an outer layer.</p><p>It becomes just a boundary line, and in the center is pure
consciousness. Remain in it. It will be very uneasy; it will be very
inconvenient and arduous, because we have never remained so. We always
run to the periphery, we always become identified with the periphery. We
live on the periphery and never in the center.</p><p>The periphery is the ego, because all events happen on the periphery,
on the circumference.</p><p>The circumference is the point from which you are in touch with
others. If I love you, the happening of love is on the periphery,
because only my periphery can be in touch with and in contact with your
periphery. Everything in this world happens on the periphery, on the
boundary line. So we always remain on the boundary line. That is the
field of activity, but the being is always in the center. So if you can
remain in this gap, in this space, and if you can be yourself -- not on
the periphery but in the center -- if you can become aware of the
periphery as the dead past, as a surface, as a body, the "you" is lost.
I am not talking about this physical body. Really, the ego is the
body.</p><p>So if there is this space, not intellectually comprehended, not
logically understood but existentially felt, it will become
inconvenient. You will become uneasy, as if you are dying, because you
have always remained on the periphery; that has been your life. So if
you go back to the center, it will be just like dying, because at
present the periphery has become the life. You do not know any other
life. You will feel just like sinking, dying, as if suffocated, and the
mind will say, "Go back to the periphery. The life is there."</p><p>But on the periphery there is no life -- only action. There is only
doing, not being. That is why when you have not to do anything, that not
doing becomes so difficult that you cannot remain with it, you begin to
do something. You may read a newspaper, you may put on the radio, you
may do anything. Or if there is nothing to do, then you may go to sleep.
But remaining in non-doing is the most arduous thing. Not for a single
moment are you in non-doing. And the being is only revealed to those who
can remain in the non-doing, who remain in the center.</p><p>That is what is meant by negative cooperation -- your cooperation is
needed in a negative way. You are not to do something; you are to remain
in non-doing. And then the explosion takes place.</p><p>It just happens to you. And when it has happened, you will always be
in the center. It does not mean that you will not be able to do
anything. You will be able to do, but the quality of the action will be
altogether different. Now a different kind of love will be possible from
the center, a different kind of activity will be possible from the
center. Now love will not be an act, but a state of mind.</p><p>It will not be that sometimes you love and sometimes you do not love.
Now it will become your very existence. You will be loving, and every
action and every relationship will have a different quality, a different
meaning, a different depth. Through this explosion you will be totally
unidentified with the mind, with the ego, with the body, with the
periphery -- totally unidentified.</p><p>Destruction of the identification is the explosion. You will not be
continuous now, because any continuity is on the periphery. This is not
something continuous with the periphery, it is a jump. If you go on
running on the periphery, then it is a continuity. If you go round and
round on the periphery you may run for a lifetime, but each step is
bound with the previous one, and each step leads you to the next. It is
a linked process.</p><p>But jumping from the periphery to the center is not continuous with
the old. It is discontinuous -- not a further step and not caused by
your previous step. It is completely new and uncaused.</p><p>This becomes difficult to understand, because in this world of
happenings and events nothing is uncaused. But modern physics has come
nearer to this point; modern physics has come to a parallel situation.
The behavior of the electron is discontinuous. So the whole physical
science, because of this behavior of electrons, has taken a new
dimension.</p><p>Before this century, physics was the system most based on scientific
method. Everything was caused, everything was a continuity, and
everything was certain, because only with a causal link is there a
certainty. When things can happen uncaused, then there is no certainty,
then there are really no laws that can be applied.</p><p>The whole science is wavering today because they cannot decide the
behavior of the electron. It behaves without causes. Sometimes it
disappears from one point and then appears on another without any
continuity in between. From point A, the electron disappears; on point
B, it appears. And there is no continuity of existence between A and B.
It has not been continuous, it has not traveled. This becomes
mysterious, but I take it as an analogy.</p><p>There are two types of thinking: one is logical thinking and the
other is analogical thinking. Logical thinking proceeds in sequence:
"This is so, therefore, that will happen."</p><p>The cause is determined, so the effect will follow. The logical
process is a definite, certain process. Given particular premises,
particular results will follow automatically.</p><p>There is no freedom, in logical thinking, there is no freedom.
Everything is caused by the past, so it is dominated by the past. If I
will give you a particular amount of poison, you will die; you are not
free. A particular amount of poison will cause death. Death must follow;
it is a certainty, a continuity, a causal link.</p><p>Analogical thinking is quite different -- altogether different.
Analogical thinking is in a way poetic. You jump from one thing to
another simply through analogy, not through logical sequences. For
example, I may love someone and may write a poem in which I say, "My
beloved is just like the moon." There is no connection. There is no
causal link between the face of my beloved and the moon. There is no
relationship at all, only analogy. I have jumped from one point to
another without traveling in between in any sequence. It is just like
the behavior of the electron.</p><p>Poets have always been behaving like that, they jump from one point
to another simply through analogy. There may be no obvious resemblance
even, but if it appears to the poet that it somehow resembles, something
has a resonance, that is enough. Something is re-echoed. Then there is a
jump, an analogical jump.</p><p>The whole literature of mysticism is analogical. Mystics can only
give you analogy, that is why there are so many parables. They were all
analogical; Jesus was talking in analogy, Buddha also, and everyone.
They are not giving any logical reasons and arguments. Really, Jesus has
never argued any point. There is no argument, but just analogy.</p><p>If you are sympathetic, only then can you understand analogical
thinking. If you are not sympathetic, then you cannot understand,
because analogy depends not on reasoning but on your sympathetic
attitudes and on whether you can continue the same process inside
yourself.</p><p>So for analogy, I take the behavior of the electron; just like this
is the spiritual explosion.</p><p>The old just drops on the periphery. There is no link between the
periphery and the center, there is no travel. You do not travel from the
periphery to the center. If you travel, then there will be a link from
the periphery, then the first step</p><p>toward the center will be taken on the periphery, and it must be
connected with the previous one. Then there is a causal link.</p><p>You are on the periphery, and suddenly you find yourself at the
center. There is no travel in between. That is explosion. We will take
another analogy, because physics may not be known to you. For example,
you sleep in Bombay and dream that you are in London. In the morning
when the dream is over and the sleep is over, will you have to travel
back from London to Bombay? Again, you dream that you are in London
while sleeping in Bombay. Someone comes and wakes you up, and you were
in London. Will you awaken in London or in Bombay? You will awaken in
Bombay. But how did you come back?</p><p>Did you travel any distance? If you travel the distance, then you
will not wake up, because the distance can only be traveled in dreams.
If you travel the distance, if you take a plane, then the plane will be
a part of the dream. If you simply wake up, then the dream will be
discontinued in London; you will wake up in Bombay, and there will be no
travel in between. So the waking is something new. It is not a
continuity with the dream.</p><p>So the periphery is the dream -- the dream of the doing, the dream of
the ego. That is why in India mystics have said, "This is illusion."
They have said, "This is just a dream; the whole world is just a dream."
And when Shankara and others have said that this whole world is a dream,
this is an analogy and must not be misunderstood. It has been
misunderstood. You can point out what nonsense they are telling. Is this
world a dream?</p><p>It is so real! The Indian mystic philosopher Shankara also knew this.
Really, this is real.</p><p>But he is talking in analogy.</p><p>"The world is a dream." When it is said, it is not meant that the
world is actually a dream.</p><p>It only means that if you are awakened in it, the previous awareness
will be discontinued.</p><p>You will not find any connection between dream and waking. You will
not find any connection whatsoever, any relation whatsoever. You will be
just bewildered how you were in London and how you came back.</p><p>But no one is bewildered really. When one is out of the dream, one is
never bewildered.</p><p>Are you ever bewildered? You just say, "Oh! It was a dream," and the
chapter is closed.</p><p>You never think about it. The same thing happens whenever the
explosion is there. You know, "Oh! The dreaming entity has dissolved. It
was a dream, and now I am in the center." You never ask, "How? How was I
on the periphery, and how did I come back to the center again? Hod did I
travel?"</p><p>People would ask Buddha: "How did you become enlightened?" The
question is absurd.</p><p>It is just like asking someone how he came out of a dream. What is
the method? What is the technique? How can you practice coming out of a
dream? The dream is just broken, but the dream has its own ways of being
broken. Sometimes a dream becomes a nightmare, it becomes unbearable.
Then the very unbearableness of it, the anguish of it, causes it to be
broken.</p><p>So if life on the periphery has become a nightmare, if living as we
live has become hellish, then all of this will put you out of the dream.
But when you are out of it, you will know it is not caused, it is not a
continuity. That is why we call it an explosion.</p><p>Something new happens in it -- something totally new. It cannot be
understood in terms of the old.</p><p>So what can you do even negatively? You can do at least three things
negatively. One, be aware -- even if you can be aware for only a single
moment. Be aware that you have become identified with a past which is
not your being. The being is in the present, here and now, and you are
identified with something which is not here and now. Be aware of this.
Let this awareness come to you suddenly, anywhere. You are walking on
the street --</p><p>stop for a moment, be suddenly aware. Anywhere, in any situation,
stop for a moment and be suddenly aware where you are -- on the
periphery or in the center? Are you identified with the memory or are
you not identified with the memory? In the beginning this can come only
for a moment, or not even a moment. There will be just a glimpse for
part of a moment. You will feel it, and</p><p>it will be gone. But that glimpse will deepen, and there will be a
new movement from the periphery to the center -- a movement just like
the electron -- a jump, a leap from one point to another. The situation
will deepen.</p><p>Remain aware as much as you can, and use any and every situation. For
example, the breath has gone out, and the breath has not come in. There
is a gap</p><p>-- a very minute, a very small gap between the two. Neither are you
taking the breath nor is the breath going out. Become aware of that gap.
Remain in it for a single moment; you will feel the center, and you will
be far away from the periphery. You will be out of the dream.</p><p>You are going to sleep, be aware that sleep is coming in, is
descending on you; you are sinking in it. Then there is a moment when
you are neither awake nor asleep. The mind is changing its dimension.
For a single moment there is neither sleep nor are you awake. Be aware
of it and remain in the gap, and you will be thrown to the center. You
will be off the periphery.</p><p>In the morning you are returning from a state of sleep. Feel the
moment when you have not yet become awake, but sleep has gone. There is
always a moment. Whenever the mind changes from one state to another,
there is a gap. Everywhere there is a gap, because without the gap
change is impossible; and in that gap you are never on the periphery.
That gap is discontinuous with the periphery. You must understand
exactly what I am saying. No gap is on the periphery; every gap is at
the center.</p><p>The only continuity is on the periphery -- one event happening,
another event happening.</p><p>And in between, in the gap, is always the center. You always go back
to the center, and for another moment you always come back on the
periphery. But this happening is so rapid, it is so timeless in a way,
that ordinarily you cannot become aware of it. But if you become aware,
attentive, watchful and careful, then by and by you will have
glimpses.</p><p>You love someone, and the love has gone and the hatred has not yet
set in. There is a moment. The love happens on the periphery, the hatred
happens on the periphery, but the gap in between them always happens at
the center. So when you love, you are on the periphery; when you hate,
you are on the periphery. But when you change from love to hate or hate
to love, you are not on the periphery.</p><p>The gap is always at the center. You are thrown back. You cannot
change on the periphery because on the periphery you are only doing. The
being is at the center. You must come back to change, but this coming
and going is so rapid, is so timelessly rapid, that ordinarily you
cannot become alert about it.</p><p>Be alert in any change. You have been ill, now the illness has gone,
and the health has not yet come in. Be aware -- you will be at the
center. No change is possible on the periphery itself. That is why
everyone needs sleep, because in sleep a great change happens. If you
cannot sleep deeply you will not be able to live, because life needs
certain changes every day. Every day, much is to be changed in the body,
in the mind, in the emotions. There is much change every day. So nature
has a way of making you unconscious, because consciously you will not
remain in the center for long. You are thrown unconscious so that you
are not on the periphery, you are not running to the periphery. You are
asleep, you are unconscious. So you are at the center, and you have
settled in the being.</p><p>But even when you are awake there are changes. As an analogy, you
change a gear in your car. For a very short time you put the car in
neutral. It is always through the neutral position that you change the
gear. Neutral means no gear. If you shift from the first gear to the
second, you cannot shift it directly. It must be put in neutral first,
then it can be changed. The more expert you become, the less time it
takes. Really, an expert driver becomes unaware that every time a gear
is changed it passes through neutral. It is changed so swiftly that he
need not be aware of it. Only one who is learning is aware, no one is
aware otherwise. And neutral is always the difficulty in learning.
Whenever you change from one action to another, you come back to the
neutral state, to the center. So be aware.</p><p>Someone has insulted you, now you will change, you cannot remain the
same. You will have to change on the periphery. The same face has become
irrelevant, you will have to change the total face. Now be aware of what
is happening inside. You will have to go to the center, again come back
to the periphery, and then you can change your face. So when someone
insults you, meditate inside. Go in. He has given a point of change.</p><p>Tantra has used intoxicants to make the seeker aware of the changing
state of consciousness. They will go on giving you some intoxicant, and
the teacher will say, "Be aware of the gap." Up to that moment you were
aware, and now you are losing awareness. So be aware of the moment when
you change from consciousness to unconsciousness. One is always
changing, and if one becomes</p><p>aware of these changing moments, one becomes aware of the center.</p><p>A Zen master will throw you out of the window and will cry from
behind, "Be aware!"</p><p>You have been thrown, you are in between, you are just passing the
window, and you are about to hit the ground. He cries, "Be aware!" You
have fallen on the ground, your face must change. Now the situation is
quite different. You have come to ask some metaphysical question, and he
has done something completely con-metaphysical. He has thrown you out of
the window; you were asking whether God is or not.</p><p>It is absolutely irrelevant to throw one through the window. But he
says, "Be aware!" in the exact moment when you will be changing faces,
changing a state. When you are just passing through the window, it is
not only your body that is passing through a change, your state of
consciousness will be passing through a change also. And a teacher knows
exactly when it changes. That exact moment he will cry, "Be aware!" And
if you can listen to him for that moment, you will be at the center --
thrown out of the periphery.</p><p>So whenever there is any changing situation, be careful to look
inside. There is no traveling. There is only a jump from the periphery
to the center and from the center to the periphery. And the behavior is
just like the electron, or just like dreams. Deepen this awareness. This
is all that you can do. This is negative because awareness is not a
doing, awareness is not an act.</p><p>Whenever you are in a changing state, be aware, and there will be no
action. Action will be withheld whenever you are aware. If you become
aware, then there will be no breath even. If I put a dagger at your
throat, even the breath stops. You become so aware that everything
stops. You are thrown to the center. Awareness is not action. The
addiction with action is only to escape awareness, and we all have
become addicted -- one must do something. This addiction is helping the
continuity.</p><p>Use any opportunity to be alert -- any opportunity. And there are
thousands and thousands of opportunities every day. Be alert, and you
will feel the jump from the periphery to the center. This being at the
center can become easy for you. You are outside the house; it has become
hot. Just come in. Whenever you feel like coming in, you can come in.
Whenever you are feeling like going out, you</p><p>can go out. There is no difficulty.</p><p>When this movement from the periphery to the center has become just
like this, then you will have explosion.</p><p>I use the word `then'; I use the word `slowly'; I say `gradually'; I
say `by and by'; these words are all irrelevant. But because I cannot do
anything else, I have to use these words.</p><p>They are irrelevant as far as explosion is concerned. It is never
gradual, it is never slowly, it is never by and by. It is sudden. But
you will not be able to understand it. So for your understanding, or if
you like, your misunderstanding, these words are used.</p><p>The whole pattern of language is made for the periphery. Nothing else
can be done.</p><p>Language is created by those minds that are on the periphery. It is
needed by those minds that are on the periphery. It is a necessity of
the periphery and not of the center. The center is absolutely silent, no
language is needed there. So we have to interpret the center in the
language of the periphery, then this is bound to happen.</p><p>So do not misunderstand me when I say gradually. I never mean
gradually. The explosion will never come by and by. So these words are
only for your confidence, so that you may hope, so that it may become
conceivable for you, so that something on the periphery may be
understood. It is just like talking about the world of waking
consciousness to a person who is in a dream.</p><p>One has to use dream language which is absurd. Any language is
absurd. Any expression is absurd in a way, but nothing can be done. One
feels completely helpless, and the helplessness is so great.</p><p>One knows something. For example, I know what is meant by explosion,
I know what is meant by being at the center. But I cannot tell you. You
ask me; I tell you something, and I know all the time that I cannot tell
you. And I know what is meant by explosion, what is meant by being at
the center. The moment I begin to speak, I begin to use the language of
the periphery. The moment periphery language is used, everything becomes
distorted. So understand these implications.</p><p>You ask about chain explosions. Whenever there is an explosion, many
things begin to happen. Because the phenomenon is so great, whenever an
individual goes through it, wherever he is, he cannot help but become
infectious. He may not want it, but this begins to happen. His being at
the center will push anyone near him to the center also. And because of
this, so many times people will begin to feel repulsed by him.</p><p>For example, Gurdjieff was felt to be repulsive by many people. They
just wanted to run away from him because by being near him they would be
pushed unknowingly. Many women seekers ran away from Gurdjieff because
they felt as if they were hit in the sex center, just by being near him.
They felt he was doing something. He was not doing anything, but because
out only working center is the sex center, the first hit is always felt
there. If male seekers will come to Gurdjieff they will not feel it so
much. But women seekers will feel it. This is because the physical body
of a male has positive bio-electricity, and the physical body of a
female has negative bio-electricity, so the opposite sexes attract each
other. The enlightened male radiates a tremendous energy for female
seekers. And both things will happen: women seekers will be attracted
toward a person like Gurdjieff and at the same time be repulsed also.
The inner hit will be felt in so many ways, and each one will feel it in
his own way.</p><p>In the West, it was felt very deeply for so many reasons. One is that
the preliminaries were lacking. In India the seeker must touch the feet
of the guru. It seems unnecessary, it looks formal, but there are
secrets. If you just bow down to a teacher, you just touch his feet,
your sex center will not be hit by his presence, because the moment you
surrender, his energy will be felt in the whole body. A surrendered body
becomes a whole. You may not have felt it, but when I tell you, now you
will feel it and know it.</p><p>So the Indian way of touching the feet is lying down completely on
the earth. All the parts of the body should touch the earth. We call it
sashtang. It means all the parts of the body touch the earth when you
are just lying on the earth. Many scientific things begin to happen.
Your body becomes one and the impact vibrates on the whole body and not
just on one center. It does not penetrates a particular center, but the
whole body. You are horizontal, and the impact goes through you from the
head toward the legs. If you are vertical, standing, the same impact
passes through you, but it cannot go through your whole body; it cannot
pass through your legs. The only sensitive part in you is the sex
center, so it passes through the sex center. If you are standing with a
teacher who is in the</p><p>center, his impact, his vibrations, will pass through your center. It
may become repulsive or it may become attractive. In either case, there
will be difficulties. If you are lying down, then the flow passes
through you, touches you, flows in you from one end to the other end.
And it has a soothing effect.</p><p>In this country, where they developed this inner science, it took
centuries. And they know only by so many experiences, because man cannot
be experimented upon like a pig. It took centuries to know these things
-- through experiences and happenings only. They made it a basic
condition that one should begin with trust, faith. If you are faithful
then you become open. If you are doubting, then you are closed. If you
are closed, then the same energy which would have helped you toward your
explosion will go round and round. It cannot penetrate you, you are
closed. It will not be possible to help you. If you are open and
trusting, then it goes deep inside. Then the explosion becomes a chain
explosion. And this can happen, this always happens. So a trusting
attitude creates great chains of explosion.</p><p>Sometimes the chain explosion goes on continuously, even when the
original teacher has died. For example, in the tradition of the Sikhs,
the tenth guru is the last. Up to the tenth, gurus continued, one was
followed by another. But with the tenth, the tradition was stopped and
broken. What is the reason? Why did Govind Singh stop the chain? It was
continuous from Nanak to Govind Singh. It was a living force, but with
Govind Singh it was stopped. It could not be delivered and transferred,
as no one was capable. No one was open to receive it completely,
totally, and it cannot be given partially. Either you are totally open
or not.</p><p>Partial trust is no trust. It is just deception. It is not that you
believe ninety-nine percent, even ninety-nine point nine per cent will
not do. And the one-tenth percent doubt will be enough to kill the whole
thing, because the one-tenth percent doubt will make you closed.</p><p>If you trust openly, then there is a chain reaction; then you come
completely into the touch. Then the touch is not just a touch, it
becomes part and parcel of your being.</p><p>If you are open, it does not mean that you are taking anything from
me. There is no "me"</p><p>as such. It is not that you are taking something from someone else,
it is only that you yourself are reflected in your own self. We just
look separate because of the ego. If you are open, then the chain can
continue for centuries. For example, Buddha's chain still continues. Of
course, it is not so broad today; it has become a very narrow stream,
but it continues.</p><p>When Bodhidharma went to China from India it was not to teach someone
or to give the message of Buddha to the Chinese and to others. It was
only to search for a man who can be given the explosion, who is so open
that before Bodhidharma died he could transfer everything. So he was
sitting in China for nine years, continuously facing a wall. If you
would have gone to him, he would not even have looked at you. His back
was toward all the visitors. So many people asked, "What is this? Why
are you sitting like this?"</p><p>Bodhidharma would say, "I have been facing persons for many years,
but I have never found in their faces anything else than a wall. No one
is receptive; everyone is just like a wall. So it makes no difference
now. When you come to me not as a wall, then I will face you, then I
will look at you."</p><p>For nine years continuously no one came who was capable, whom
Bodhidharma could face. Then come Hui Neng. He came, stood behind, then
cut off his hand and gave it to Bodhidharma and said, "Now make an about
turn, otherwise I will cut my head."</p><p>Bodhidharma just faced Hui Neng and said, "Now the man has come. For
you I have traveled the whole of the Himalayas." And there was a
transmission without scriptures.</p><p>There was no scripture with Bodhidharma, so they say the transmission
was given without scripture. He just looked in the eyes of Hui Neng and
there was transmission, just like from one point to another with no
travel in between.</p><p>So this too must be understood. The chain of explosion is again a
jump. When something from my consciousness goes to your consciousness,
it is a leap. It was here, and then it is there, and it was never in
between. There is no process. If you are receptive, if you are open, the
flame that is here will be found there instantaneously. There will be no
time gap. The chain can continue forever, but it never does. It is very
difficult because even with a living teacher it is difficult to be
open.</p><p>The mind tries in every way to be closed because to be open is to
die. For the mind it is death. So it will try. It will argue, it will
find many reasons to be closed. It will find very absurd things. In
other moments, later on, you cannot conceive that these things could
have made you doubt, that these meaningless things made you skeptical.
These things which have no meaning at all create barriers. And if you
are not open, then the chain, the transmission, is not possible.</p><p>All your meditation, and all my stress and emphasis on meditation, is
just to make you open. Any moment you will be open, and there will be
transmission.</p><p>Minor explosions happen daily. They are only the glimpses of the
center. But that glimpse is not enough. It can help, but do not be
satisfied with it. Ordinarily we become satisfied with this. There is a
glimpse, and one becomes satisfied. One makes it a treasure, then one
goes on remembering it. When the glimpse is changed from the center to
the periphery, then it becomes a memory. Then you nourish it, then you
remember it, then you feel elated by it. Then you always wonder when it
will happen again. Then it has become a part of the periphery, of the
memory. It is useless.</p><p>Minor explosions can even be fatal if you nourish them as memory.
Throw them, forget them. Do not ask for their repetition. Only then the
major will be possible. Only then the total explosion will be
possible.</p><p>So there are minor explosions, but I never pay any attention to them.
And you should not pay any attention to them either, because then they
only become a part of the memory.</p><p>They cannot destroy the memory; on the contrary, they can strengthen
it. So a small experience, a petty experience, cannot do. Throw it.
Unless the total is achieved, do not be contented.</p><p>Before the ultimate explosion, do not be satisfied. Remain
discontented. Never remember anything that has happened. No experience
should be accumulated and nourished. As it happens, throw it, forget it,
go ahead. Unless there is a total explosion... nothing short of that
will do, so do not pay any attention.</p><p>Things have happened, things are happening, but I never talk about
minor explosions. If someone comes to me and says that there is this
minor explosion, I will just try to throw it. It should not be
remembered, it will be a barrier.</p><p>Continue to the center, until you reach to the point from where there
is no coming back. When that point comes it is never a part of memory.
You remember only the things which are lost. That which is always with
you, you need not remember.</p><p>Really, you become aware only when the experience is lost. If you
say, "I love you very much," be aware that there is every possibility
that the love is ending. It may have gone already. It is only an ego of
the past. That is why you emphasize, "I love you very much."</p><p>"Very much" is an effort to fill the gap, and there is a gap. The
love has gone. When love exists, you feel it and live it, silence is
enough. When it is gone, you chatter about it. Now silence is not
enough. On the contrary, in silence the dead love will be exposed. In
silence, you cannot hide it. Now you begin to chatter about it.
Ordinarily, we are not speaking to tell things. On the contrary, we are
speaking to hide things. In silence, you cannot hide it with words.</p><p>Whenever you become aware of any minor explosion, do not nourish the
memory, and do not long for its repetition. It has gone, it has become a
part of the dead past. Throw it. Let the dead be buried, and go ahead.
And when the real explosion, the major explosion, the ultimate
explosion, happens, you will not remember it. You will not need to
remember it, it will be with you. It will be your center. It will be
your being, you cannot forget it.</p><p>There is no meaning to remembering or forgetting. And unless the
major happens, the minor has no meaning.</p><p>And you also asked whether the people who are around me are going
through explosion.</p><p>Yes, they are going toward it. If they are not going toward it, they
cannot remain with me for long, they cannot continue. So whenever
incapable ones come to me, either they will go by themselves or I will
create situations in which they will go. With them nothing can be done.
But those who remain with me, continue with me. I allow them to do so
only if they are going toward the explosion, if their understanding is
deepening, if they are becoming more alert and aware. Of course, the
path is arduous and there are many pitfalls. One goes one step and then
falls two steps back; it happens daily. The path is not straight; it is
criss-cross. And it is not on a plane; it is just like on a hilly track.
So many</p><p>times you come to the same point, only on a slightly higher
level.</p><p>I allow only those to be near me in whom I see possibilities,
potentialities, otherwise I create situations in which they leave by
themselves. It is very easy to create a situation for someone to leave.
It is very difficult to create a situation for someone to stay.</p><p>Everyone is ready to leave, because to come to the center is really
the only arduous adventure. And with me, they will be always in a
struggle. With me, they cannot exist on the periphery. Their minds will
try every method to be on the periphery, but they can only stay with me
if they are proceeding toward the center.</p><p>When you are with me, you continue to be on the periphery, and I
continue to be on the center. The whole process is the same as the inner
struggle in each one of you. Your being remains at the center, and your
ego remains on the periphery. There is struggle and tension. And when
you come to me, you become the periphery, I become the center, and the
same struggle begins. But being with me helps in many ways. If you can
continue to be with me for some time, you will be able to remain with
your being, with your center, more easily. This phenomenon is the same
as it is within each individual; there is no difference.</p><p>When I talk to you, I talk to you as your center. When you are with
me it is as if you are with your center. And when one day you will
explode to the center, then you will know.</p><p>Before that you cannot know, before that you will have to just trust
me.</p><p>When you come to your center, then you will know that you have not
lived with me before, you have only lived in your center's reflection.
But that comes only later on when you pass through it. But this will
happen. Everyone is potentially capable. If he hinders himself, that is
another thing. Otherwise, if you do not hinder yourself, if you are not
an enemy to yourself, you are as capable as any buddha, and the thing
will happen.</p><p>I Am the Gate Chapter #7</p><p>Chapter title: The occult mysteries of initiation</p><p>10 June 1971 pm in Bombay, India Archive</p><p>code:</p><p>7106105</p><p>ShortTitle:</p><p>GATE07</p><p>Audio:</p><p>Yes Video: No Question 1</p><p>BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE INITIATED INTO THE SPIRITUAL LIFE? WHAT
IS</p><p>THE DEEPER OCCULT AND ESOTERIC SIGNIFICANCE OF INITIATION? WHAT</p><p>SORT OF INITIATION ARE YOU GIVING TO THE NON-SANNYASINS AND TO</p><p>THE SANNYASINS? PLEASE TELL US ABOUT THEM IN DETAIL.</p><p>Man exists as if in sleep. Man is asleep. Whatsoever is known as
waking is also a sleep.</p><p>Initiation means to be intimate contact with one who is awakened.
Unless you are in intimate contact with one who is awakened, it is
impossible to come out of your sleep, because the mind is capable even
to dream that it is out of sleep. The mind can dream that now there is
no more sleep, and in any dream you cannot know that it is a dream. You
can only know that it was a dream when you are out</p><p>of it.</p><p>You can never know a dream in the present. You always become aware of
it when it has gone, when it has passed. No one can ever say, "This is a
dream." No present tense can be used for a dream. You always say that
this was a dream, because in a dream, the dream itself appears to be
real. If a dream is not appearing as real, it will be broken. Only if
there is an appearance of reality can dream be created.</p><p>When I say man is asleep, this is to be understood. We are dreaming
continuously twenty-four hours a day. In the night we are closed to the
outward world, dreaming inside. In the day our senses are opened toward
the outside world, but the dream continues inside. Close your eyes for a
moment, and you can be again in a dream. It is a continuity inside. You
are aware of the outside world, but the awareness is not without the
dreaming mind. It is over, and imposed on, the dreaming mind, but inside
the dream continues. That is why we are not seeing what is real, even
when we are so-called awake.</p><p>We impose our dreams on reality. We never see what is, we always see
our projections.</p><p>If I look at you and there is a dream in me, you will become an
object of projection. I will project my dream on you, and whatsoever I
understand about you will be mixed with my dream, with my projection.
When I love you, you appear to me one way. When I do not love you, you
appear to me completely different. You are not the same. I have used you
just as a screen and projected my dreaming mind on you. When I love you
then the dream is different, so you appear different. When I do not love
you, you are the same, the screen is the same, but the projection is
different. Now I am using you as a screen for another dream of mine.
Again the dream can change. Again I can love you, then you will again
appear different to me. We are never seeing what is. We are always
seeing our own dream projected on what is.</p><p>So the dreaming mind creates a world around it which is not real.
That is what is meant by maya, illusion. By illusion it is not meant
that the world is not, the noise outside on the street is not. It is but
as it is. We can never know it unless the dreaming mind stops
inside.</p><p>For someone the noise may be music, for someone else just
disturbance. In some</p><p>moment you may not be aware of the noise, in another you will become
aware. In some moments you will tolerate it, in some moments it will
become unbearable, intolerable. The noise is the same, the street is the
same, the traffic is the same, but your dreaming mind changes.</p><p>With your dreaming mind the whole thing around you takes on new
colors. When we say the world is illusion, maya, it does not mean that
the world is not; it is. But as we see it, that seeing is illusion. It
is nowhere to be found. So when someone is awakened it is not that this
world just disappears, but the world that was known by him before his
awakening disappears completely. An altogether new world, an objective
world, comes in its place. All the colors that were given by you, all
the shapes, all the meanings and interpretations that were given by you
according to your dreaming mind, are no more.</p><p>As far as this world of maya, this world of illusion, this world of
projection is concerned, we never live in one world. Each man lives in
his own world. And there are as many worlds as there are dreaming
persons. I am not the same to each one of you. Each one projects onto me
something. I am one as far as I am concerned. But if I myself am
dreaming, then even for me, I am different each moment. For each moment
my interpretation will differ. If I am awakened then I am the same.
Buddha says somewhere that the test of the enlightened one is that he is
the same always, just like the sea water.</p><p>Anywhere, everywhere, it is salty.</p><p>If I am awakened, then for me I am the same -- not only in this life,
but I have been the same in all lives that have gone. I have been the
same for eternity. The real me has remained the same. It is
unchangeable, only the projection changes. The screen remains the same,
the film changes, the picture changes. But the screen is never seen. You
see the picture on it projected. When there is no projection then you
see the screen, otherwise the screen is never seen. And the screen
remains the same. The picture changes, and you see a change in me. If I
am awakened, I will be the same for me, but you will look at me in so
many ways, because you will come to me with your dreaming mind which
will project.</p><p>To someone I may look like a friend and to someone I may look like an
enemy. He will project himself. We create a world around ourselves, and
everyone lives in his own world. That is why there is a collision;
worlds collide, your world and mine. So when two persons begin to live
in one room, there are two worlds</p><p>living there, and the collision is inevitable. There are not only two
persons living in the room, the room has enough place for two persons --
but the room has not enough space for two worlds. Whenever there are two
persons in a room, there are two worlds.</p><p>The whole conflict of human society, of human relationship, is
between worlds, not between persons. If, really, I am a person without a
world created by my dreams and you are also a person without a world
created by your dreams, we can live in a room for eternity without any
collision, because this room is enough for two persons. But for two
worlds even the whole planet is not enough. There exist so many worlds,
as every individual is a world. And he lives inside his world and is
closed. This is a sleep. You have around yourself a filmy enclosure of
projections, ideas, notions, conceptions, interpretations. You are a
projector going on and on projecting things which are nowhere, only
inside you, and the whole world becomes a screen. You can never be aware
by yourself that you are in deep sleep.</p><p>There is a sufi saint Hijra... an angel appears in his dream. He says
to him that he should save as much water as possible because tomorrow
morning all the water of this world is going to be poisoned by the
devil, and everyone who will drink this water will become mad. So the
fakir saves as much water, the whole night, as possible. And really the
phenomenon happens. Everyone become mad that next morning. No one knows
the whole city has become mad. Only the fakir is not mad, but the whole
city talks as if the fakir has gone mad. He knows it is everyone else
who is mad, but no one believes him.</p><p>He goes on drinking his water and remains alone, but he cannot
continue. The whole city is living in an altogether different world. No
one listens to him, and now there is a rumor that he will be caught and
sent to prison.</p><p>They have come one morning to get hold of him. Either he should be
treated as ill or should go to prison. He cannot be allowed freedom. He
has become absolutely mad.</p><p>Whatsoever he says is not understandable, he talks in a different
language. The fakir is at a loss to understand. He tries to help them to
remember their past, but they have forgotten everything. They do not
know anything of the past, anything about before that maddening morning.
They cannot understand, the fakir has become incomprehensible. They are
around his house, they have caught hold of</p><p>him.</p><p>And the fakir says, "Give me one moment more. I shall treat myself."
He runs to the common well, drinks the water, and he becomes all right.
Now the whole city is happy.</p><p>The fakir is okay now. Now he is not mad. Really, he has gone mad
now! But now he is part and parcel of the common world. If everyone is
asleep, you will never be aware even that you are asleep. If everyone is
mad, and you are mad, you will never be aware of it.</p><p>By initiation is meant that you have surrendered to someone who is
awakened. You say,</p><p>"I do not understand it. I cannot understand, and I am part of the
world which is mad and asleep. I am dreaming all the time. My reasoning
is phony, because whenever I act, I act from the irrational part of my
mind. I always act unconsciously, then later on I rationalize it. I fall
in love with someone, and then I begin to rationalize why I love --
where is the reason? The phenomenon happens this way. First I begin to
like something, and then I find reasons why I like it. The liking comes
first, then follows rationalization. And the liking is irrational."</p><p>This feeling can come even from a sleeping person, because a sleep is
not always deep. It wavers, becoming very deep, then coming up and
becoming very shallow. Sleep is never on one plane. There are
fluctuations in sleep, even in ordinary sleep there are fluctuations. In
the whole night you are not on the same plane. Sometimes you go very
deep, so deep that you cannot remember anything about it later on. If
you have slept very deeply, then in the morning you say, "I have not
dreamed anything." You have dreamed, but the sleep was so deep that you
cannot remember. Now there are implements which can show that you have
dreamed. You deny because no memory is there. You were so deep, the
distance was so much from your conscious memory, that the mind could not
get anything from the dream. Sometimes sleep is very shallow, just on
the border. Then you can remember your dream. Ordinarily we always
remember only morning dreams, just before we are coming out of the
sleep, because the sleep is very shallow and the gap is very little.</p><p>Ordinary sleep is a fluctuation between so many levels, so many
planes.</p><p>Sometimes you are just wavering between waking and sleep. You can
hear something from the outside when you are wavering, when the
fluctuations are just on the border. You have gone to sleep. You hear
something, someone is talking about something, something is understood,
something is lost, and you can hear. But then you are fast asleep, in a
deep sleep. Then someone is talking and you cannot hear. There is no
question of interpretation, there is no question of meaning, you cannot
hear.</p><p>Just like in this ordinary sleep, the same happens in the
metaphysical sleep I am talking about. Sometimes you are just on the
border line, very near to the buddha. Then you can understand something
of what the buddha is talking about, what he is saying. You can
understand something, but, of course, it will never be exactly as it is
said. But at least you have something, you have a glimpse of the
truth.</p><p>So a person who is on his border of metaphysical sleep will like to
be initiated. He can hear something, he can understand something, he
sees something. Everything is as if it is in a mist, but still he feels
something. So he can approach a person who is awakened and surrender
himself. This much can be done by a sleepy person. This much can be done
so that he can surrender. This surrendering means he understands that
something quite different from his sleep is happening. Somewhere he
feels it. He cannot know it correctly, but he feels it.</p><p>Whenever a buddha passes, those who are on the borderline of sleep
feel that something has happened to this man. He behaves differently, he
speaks differently, he lives differently, he walks differently.
Something has happened to this man. Those who are on the borderline can
feel it, but they are asleep. And this borderline is not permanent.
Again they may go in a deep sleep, but even a word can pull them out. So
before they fall down into deeper unconsciousness they can surrender to
the awakened one.</p><p>This is initiation from the side of the initiated. He says, "I cannot
do anything myself. I am helpless. And I know that if I do not surrender
in this moment, I may go again into deep sleep. Then it will be
impossible to surrender." So there are moments which cannot be lost. And
one who loses those moments may not be able to get them again for
centuries, for lifetimes, because it is not in one's hands to come to
the borderline.</p><p>Sometimes it happens for so many reasons beyond your control. You
cannot</p><p>control your sleep. Sometimes it happens that a buddha is passing.
You can surrender, but only if you are on the border.</p><p>There is a very meaningful story in Buddha's life.â¦</p><p>When he himself became awakened, for seven days continuously he was
silent. He did not feel like speaking. This is a very beautiful story.
The gods became uneasy, because if Buddha remains silent what will
become of those on the borderline? He cannot do anything for those who
are in a deep sleep, even a Buddha cannot do anything for them.</p><p>And he cannot do anything for those who are already awakened, they do
not need any help from him. But there are a few who are just on the
edge, and just a small push will awaken them. His very presence may be
enough to awaken them.</p><p>So the gods came to Buddha, prayed to him, and asked him to speak.
Buddha said to them that there are persons who cannot be helped. They
are so asleep, it is useless to speak with them. Those who can listen to
me, they are already awake. So there is no need to talk with them
either. So why do you ask me to talk? It is meaningless. Let me remain
silent. And the gods said, "But there is still a category that is left.
Those who are not so awake that they can understand that they are just
on the border. They may not even listen to all you say, but even a word
may pull them out. You must speak."</p><p>It is only after thousands and thousands of years that a person
becomes a buddha. He must speak, he must not remain silent. The
opportunity must not be lost. Buddha became convinced. Yes, there is a
third category. That third category is the category of the initiates,
the mid-category.</p><p>From the one who is being initiated it is surrender, and nothing else
will do. Initiation means to be surrendered. The Buddhist term for
initiation and the one who is being initiated is shrotapann, one who has
come in the current. Then you will have your aims, your goal to reach
somewhere.</p><p>So there are persons who come to the enlightened one, but they will
begin to argue. They will want reasons, they will ask proof, they will
like to be convinced. This way is struggle</p><p>-- they fight with the enlightened one. This does not harm the
enlightened one,</p><p>but this harms you because the moment is being lost. You were in the
mid- category, that is why you have come. But now you are losing the
moment; it may be that you will go again in deep sleep. Surrendering
means one who begins to flow with the stream, who gives himself to the
stream.</p><p>Now the stream flows; he follows it. He is just in a let-go, a total
let-go. So for the initiated, initiation is a let-go, a complete trust,
a complete surrender. It can never be partial. If you surrender
partially, you are not surrendering; you are deceiving yourself.</p><p>There can be no partial surrender, because in a partial surrender you
are withholding something. And that withholding may push you again into
deep sleep. That non-surrendering part will prove fatal; any moment you
may be again in deep sleep. Surrender is always total. That is why faith
was required and will always be required in initiation.</p><p>Faith is required as a total condition, as a total requirement. And
the moment you surrender totally, things begin to change. Now you cannot
go back to your dreamland.</p><p>This surrendering shatters the whole projection. This surrender
shatters the whole projecting mind, because this projecting mind is
tethered to an ego. It cannot live without the ego. The ego is the main
center of it. I call someone my friend. Why? I call someone my enemy.
Why? The enemy is one who has hurt my ego, and the friend is one who has
fed it, who has nourished it. That is why we say, "A friend in need is a
friend indeed."</p><p>Why need? What is the need? The need comes when your ego is starving,
then the friend is known. Our whole dreaming world, our dreaming mind,
is based on the pedestal of ego. If you surrender, you have surrendered
the very base. You have given up completely. Now you cannot continue
wavering, because the dream is given up.</p><p>So from the side of the initiate, it is a total surrender. For the
initiated one it is not very difficult to understand what initiation is.
It is very simple. It is just a person who is asleep asking for help to
be awakened, and he surrenders to someone who is awake. This is very
simple. The thing is not very complex.</p><p>But for the one who initiates you, the thing is very complex, very
difficult. Ordinarily we think that surrendering is very difficult. You
are helpless, you</p><p>cannot do anything. You may not surrender, but when you know more you
will come to the point of surrendering.</p><p>One day it is bound to come because you cannot do anything else. You
cannot continue with a non-surrendering attitude, because this will
create miseries, agony and hell for you. You cannot continue. There is
bound to come one moment when out of your frustration, out of your own
nightmare, you will surrender. This is not the difficult part of the
initiation. This is a very simple thing. But for the one who initiates
you, it is a very complex affair; there are many things involved. Many
things are ESOteric, not EXOteric.</p><p>It is good that we should understand from the exoteric, the outer
things, and then proceed to the esoteric, the inner things.</p><p>The first thing corresponding to surrender is responsibility. The one
who is asleep surrenders, the one who is awake takes the responsibility.
When you go to a Buddha, to a Jesus or to a Mohammed, and surrender
yourself, he takes the whole responsibility. What you are surrendering
is that which is with you. You cannot surrender anything more --</p><p>you are nothing more than sleep and dream. You surrender this. Your
sleep, your dreaming, your whole nonsense of the past... you
surrender.</p><p>Surrendering is always of the past, responsibility is always for the
future. You have no future, you are only a dreamy past. A long number of
memories, of dreams, of many lives, is surrendered. That too you
surrender very arduously. It is so difficult to surrender even this,
just a dusty past. Nothing more is with you. You have been asleep and
dreamy.</p><p>You have a record of so many dreams -- good or bad, beautiful or
ugly, but dreams all the same. You surrender before being lost: that too
with great hardship, that too is very difficult, a struggle; that too
you try to withhold, to resist. Something must be saved.</p><p>What have you got? Nothing but a long series of dreams, a long
sleep.</p><p>So from the initiated it is a surrendering of the past. From the one
who initiates you, it is a responsibility for the future. He becomes
responsible, and only he can be responsible.</p><p>You can never be responsible. How can one who is asleep be
responsible? Responsibility is never a part of sleep. If you commit a
murder in your sleep, if you are a somnambulist walking in your sleep
and you commit a murder, no court will make you responsible, because
there is no responsibility.</p><p>A person who is in deep sleep, how is he responsible? You never feel
responsible for your dreams. You may commit anything in your dreams, but
you never feel any responsibility. You may murder, but you say that it
was just a dream. Responsibility comes with awakening. This is really a
fundamental law of life. One who is asleep is not responsible even for
himself, and one who is awakened is responsible even for others.</p><p>A person who is enlightened, who is awakened, feels he is even
responsible for the whole mess that you have created. A buddha feels
compassion. A buddha feels guilty for your crimes, for your sins; he
feels involved, he feels responsible. He knows that you do not know; he
is fully aware. For example, the third world war is going to come. The
one who is awakened knows full well that it is coming. It is coming
nearer daily. Soon it will be over us. You are asleep and deep in it. He
is not in a sleep, he is not in a dream. He is fully conscious like
radar; he knows the future that is coming. He feels guilty, he must do
something. For example, you are in a plane, flying in the sky. You are
asleep, dreamy, but the pilot is aware. If anything is going to happen,
if the engine begins to make a noise, a very slight noise; if no one
knows about it but something has gone wrong, only he will be
responsible. No one else is responsible. He is fully awake, and the only
one.</p><p>A buddha will feel responsible for all our crimes and sins. The whole
story of Jesus is based on this responsibility. The whole of
Christianity, the whole concept, begins from this responsibility. Jesus
feels responsible for all the sins of man from Adam to us. Jesus feels
responsible, so he takes the cross on his shoulders in order that our
sins may be pardoned, forgiven. He is in no way responsible. If Adam has
done something and the whole human mind has done something, why should
he be responsible? Dogmatic Christians have discussed this for
centuries. Jesus has not committed any sins; still, I say he feels
responsible because he is awakened. By the very phenomenon of awakening
he has become responsible for all that the sleepy ones have done. His
burden is added, his cross is heavy. His crucifixion is symbolic; it is
for us that he dies so that we may live.</p><p>That is why the crucifixion of Jesus has become a historic event.</p><p>He is a person who has felt responsible for the whole human race, and
dies for it so that man may be transformed. But even with his death we
are not transformed. His message was heard in our dream, and we
interpret it in our own ways. Then his life becomes a part of our
dreaming world. We create churches and dogmas, we create sects. Then
there are Catholic and Protestant sects and so many others. The whole
nonsense returns in so many new ways, and the world remains the
same.</p><p>We begin to worship him. That is, we begin to dream about him, that
he is the son of God. We are not initiated, we are not transformed.
Rather, on the contrary, we transform his reality into our dream. We
create a church for him, we create an idol of him, we worship him -- and
continue our sleep. Really, we use him as a tranquilizer. It becomes a
Sunday affair. For one hour in the week we go to him, and then we
continue on our own track. He helps us to sleep well; our conscience
becomes easy, we feel religious. We go to the church to pray, worship,
and are back home the same. We become more easy. Now there is no burden
to be religious, to be transformed. We are religious already, because we
have been to church where we have worshipped and prayed. We are
religious already, and the whole thing goes on the same way.</p><p>Corresponding to surrender is responsibility. Responsibility means
answerability. It means Jesus feels answerable for you. He feels that if
there is any God, he will be responsible. He will be asked and he will
have to answer why this or that has happened to humanity. Responsibility
means this. He feels it as a natural happening with him. And if you come
to him and surrender to him, then he becomes particularly responsible
for you.</p><p>Krishna could say to Arjuna, "Leave everything. Come to me, surrender
at my feet."</p><p>Jesus could say, "I am the truth. I am the door, I am the gate. Come
to me, pass through me. I will be the witness on the last day of your
judgment. I will answer for you." This is all analogical. Every day is
the day of judgment, and every moment is the moment of judgment. There
is not going to be any last day. This is just what could be understood
by the people to whom Jesus was speaking. "I will be responsible for
you, and I will answer for you when the divine asks, and I will be there
as a witness. You surrender to me; I will be your witness," Jesus
said.</p><p>This is a great responsibility. No one who is asleep can take it,
because even to carry your own responsibility becomes difficult in
sleep. You cannot carry others' responsibility.</p><p>You can carry others' responsibility only when your responsibility is
no more, when you are unburdened completely -- really, when you are no
more! This declaration of being no more is being made in so many
ways.</p><p>When Jesus said, "I am the son of the father who is in heaven," what
he meant really is that he is not a son of the person who is known as
his father, he is not the son of Mary who is known as his mother. Why?
Sometimes it seems very cruel. One day he was standing in a crowd and
someone said, "Your mother, Mary, has come. She is calling you outside
this crowd, she is waiting for you." And Jesus said, "I have no mother!
Who is my mother? Who is my father? No one is my mother, no one is my
father." It appears cruel. The mother is standing outside the crowd. She
is waiting, and Jesus says to tell her,</p><p>"No one is my mother, no one is my father." Why? He is just denying
the pattern of your dreaming. "This is my father, mother, wife,
brother..." This is the pattern of the dreaming mind, the dreaming
world, the world of projection. Jesus just denies it. And the moment you
deny the mother, you have denied the whole world, because with her
everything begins -- the whole world. That is the beginning, the root of
coming into this dreamy world, the root of relationship, the root of
sansara.</p><p>If you deny your mother, you have denied everything. It appears cruel
to those who are fast asleep, but it is just a fact. The emphasis that
"I am the son of the one who is in heaven," is just to say, "I am not an
individual. I am not Jesus, the son of Mary. I am part and parcel of the
divine force, the cosmic force."</p><p>One who feels like that, like part of the cosmic, can initiate you.
Otherwise, no one can initiate you. No particular individual can
initiate anyone. And it happens so many times, it is happening every day
-- those who are themselves asleep will initiate those who are also
asleep; the blind leading the blind. Both fall into the ditch. No one
who is asleep can initiate anyone. But the ego wants to initiate; this
egoistic attitude has proved very dangerous.</p><p>The whole initiation, the whole mystery of it, the whole beauty of
it, became ugly because of those who were not entitled to initiate. Only
one who has no ego</p><p>inside, who has no sleep inside, who has no dream inside, can
initiate. Otherwise, initiation is the greatest sin, because then you
are deceiving not only others but yourself also -- because initiation is
a great responsibility, the ultimate responsibility. Now you are
becoming responsible for another. To become responsible for someone is
not just a play, this is taking the impossible in your hands. You are
becoming responsible for someone else who is at folly.</p><p>So this responsibility can be taken only when there is total
surrender; otherwise it cannot be taken. One who is withholding himself,
his responsibility cannot be taken, because he will continue himself; he
will not listen to you. He will interpret you in his own ways.</p><p>There is a Sufi story.â¦</p><p>A rich man died. He was not only rich, he was wise also, which
happens very rarely. His son was only ten or twelve years of age, so he
made a will in which he wrote to the eldest of the village, the
panchayat. He proclaimed in that will, "From my property, whatsoever you
like most, you take, then you give it to my child."</p><p>The will was as clear as the sunrise. The five elders divided the
whole property. All that was of any worth, they divided among
themselves. Nothing was left except a bit which was useless. No one was
ready to take that, so it was given to the child. But the old dying man
had given a letter to the boy also, which he was to open when he came of
age. So when he was of age he opened the letter in which his father had
written, "The elders, may, of course, interpret the will in their own
way. When you are of age, give it this interpretation. This is my
interpretation, this is what I mean to say: Take all that you like most,
and then, all that you like most, give it to my child. "</p><p>The son produced the letter before the elders. They never conceived
of any such meaning, so they had divided everything amongst themselves.
They returned the whole thing, because now the meaning was clear, and
the boy was ready. And the father had also written: "It is good that
they should interpret in their own way until the time for you to take it
comes, because if I give it to you directly, before you are of age, it
will be destroyed by these elders. Let them protect it as their own
property until you are ready to take it over." And they had protected it
as if it were their own.</p><p>So whenever there is a partial surrender, you will interpret any
message, any commandment, any order to you, in the way which appeals to
you most. In your sleep, you will make it meaningful through your sleepy
mind. So unless one surrenders totally, the responsibility cannot be
taken. And when one surrenders totally, the total responsibility comes
to the teacher, to the awakened one. Then it is total.</p><p>In the old days, initiation was not easy; it was the most difficult
thing. The very phenomenon was such that it had to be difficult. One had
to wait for years to be initiated.</p><p>Even for a whole life one may wait, because unless one is ready he
will not be initiated.</p><p>This waiting stage was really a testing ground. Are you patient? Can
you wait? Only in waiting is your maturity revealed. A child cannot wait
even for a single moment. If he wants a toy, he wants it just now; he
cannot wait. So the more impatient the mind, the less mature. So before
initiation in the old days, one had to wait for so many years. This
waiting was a testing ground, and this waiting was also a
discipline.</p><p>For example, Sufis will only initiate when you have waited for a
particular period. You wait without questioning just for the moment when
the teacher himself will answer. One had to do many things. For example,
a Sufi may be a shoemaker. If you are to be initiated, you will have to
help him for years in shoemaking. And not even this can be questioned.
What will happen by the shoemaking? How are you going to be a
self-realized one? How are you going to be the divine? This shoemaking,
what is the relevance? Even if this relevance is asked about, you will
be thrown out, because that is not your business.</p><p>It is the teacher's business to know what is relevant. How can you
know? You do not know the divine, so you cannot know how shoemaking is
related to the divine; you cannot know. For five years one is just
waiting and helping the teacher in shoemaking.</p><p>He will never talk of prayer or meditation. He will never talk of
anything except shoemaking. You have waited for five years, but this is
a meditation. It is no ordinary meditation, you will be cleansed through
it.</p><p>This simple, unquestioned waiting, this relying, will make the ground
ready for</p><p>complete surrender. And sometimes it looks so easy from the outside.
It is not so easy, it is very difficult. Your mind will resist, your
mind will ask questions, your mind will raise problems. It will ask,
"What am I doing? Am I doing something rightly or am I just wasting my
time? Is this man really worth being with, with this shoemaking? Is it
in any way related to the search?"</p><p>The mind will continue to ask. Inside you will be bubbling, and yet
you cannot ask. You have to rely, you have to wait for the moment. If
you can wait for even one year, the mind will become silent by itself.
It cannot continue unless you feed it daily, unless you help it daily.
Unless you become daily disturbed by it, it cannot continue. You have
been just waiting, and the mind is just chattering, raising
questions.</p><p>You have waited and waited and waited, then the question will become
meaningless. The mind will just be exhausted. It will just lose
interest, it will just go dead. And though you are waiting, a moment
will come when there is no questioning. When there is no questioning,
the teacher will answer.</p><p>Exactly the moment of no questioning within the disciple is the
moment for the teacher to answer, because now you can hear. Your
chattering has stopped; now you are silent, now you have become a
passage. But ordinarily we feed the mind daily. We are disturbed. We
will not even wait for an hour, to see whether it can continue for one
hour. You will not even wait and see whether this mind can continue. It
cannot continue, because with the mind nothing is permanent. It will go
by itself.</p><p>A Tibetan teacher, Milarepa, had it as a rule that if some question
came to him he would answer only after you waited for seven days. This
is the price one has to pay for everything. If you asked this moment, he
would throw you out: "Wait for seven days, stay with the question." And,
really, you cannot stay with it for seven days. Seven days are too
long.</p><p>Sometimes someone comes to me and asks me a question, and if I can
dodge him and talk even for two minutes about something else, he forgets
the question; he never comes again for his question. He can talk for one
hour and will not raise that question again. It was just a whim, just a
wave. It means nothing. So if you can wait for five years, you will not
be the same.</p><p>Waiting will be a great difficulty. In the old days initiation was
done after a long</p><p>waiting.</p><p>Then surrender was easy, and responsibility too could be taken. Now
the whole thing has become different, no one is ready to wait. The most
acute disease of the modern mind is hurry. The new phenomenon of the
modern mind is time consciousness, the basic change that has come in the
mind is time consciousness. We have become so time conscious that not
for a single moment can we wait. It is an impossibility.</p><p>That is why this whole age has become childish. There is no maturity
anywhere, because maturity is always a by-product of waiting. And
waiting is only possible with timeless consciousness, not with time
consciousness. Because of this time consciousness, initiation has become
impossible. You cannot be initiated. You run past Buddha and ask him,
"Will you initiate me?" You meet Buddha on the street while you are
running, and even this utterance of four or five words has not been from
a standing position. You have been running.</p><p>Maturity has become impossible. But why this time consciousness which
is a barrier --</p><p>the greatest barrier? Why was it not there before? Why is it now
great?</p><p>Time consciousness deepens only when you become fearful of death. You
may not be aware of it, but the more you become aware of death, the more
you become time conscious. Not a single moment should be lost! Death is
there. Every moment lost is lost forever, and death comes near; you are
going to die. So use every moment! You cannot wait, because waiting only
means waiting for death. Death is coming. No one can wait, no one knows
what is going to happen tomorrow, the next moment. Death may come.</p><p>You become uneasy, you begin trembling, you begin to run. This whole
running of the modern mind is because of the fear of death.</p><p>For the first time man is so fearful of death, because for the first
time man has become absolutely unaware of the deathless. If you are
aware of the deathless, then there is no hurry. You live in eternity,
and there is always enough time, more than enough. Nothing is lost,
because time is eternal. So if a moment is lost does not mean that less
time will be left. The time remains the same because it is eternal. From
a treasury which is immeasurable, you cannot lose anything. You may go
on losing, it makes no difference; what remains is the same. You
cannot</p><p>take anything out of it. But we are short of time. Time is short, and
death is there.</p><p>We are only conscious of the body which is going to die. We are not
conscious of the inner consciousness which is deathless. In ancient days
there were people who were conscious of the deathless. Because of their
consciousness, deathlessness, they created an atmosphere, a new sphere,
in which there was no hurry. Things would move slowly if they moved at
all. Then initiation was easy, then waiting was easy, then surrender was
easy, then responsibilities were easy. They all have become difficult
now. But still, there is no alternative, initiation is needed. The old
initiation has become impossible, so a new initiation must replace it.
The old must be replaced by a newer one. My whole effort is toward
that.</p><p>If you are in a hurry, then I will give initiation in your running
state of affairs, because otherwise there will be no initiation. So I
cannot ask you to wait as a precondition. I must initiate you first and
then prolong your waiting in so many ways. Through so many devices I
will persuade you to wait, because without waiting there is no maturity.
So when you will be ready there will be a second initiation, which would
have been the first in the old days. It cannot now be the first.</p><p>Sometimes people are bewildered. Sometimes someone comes to me; he
has not even heard me, he has not even known me, and I initiate him into
sannyas. This is absurd, not understandable at all. But I know. And
whatsoever I am doing, I am doing very considerately. This is just the
beginning, this initiation, because only through this initiation will I
be able to create devices for his waiting; otherwise he cannot wait. If
I tell him, "Wait five years, and then I will give you initiation," he
cannot wait. If I give it to him this very moment, then he can wait.</p><p>So let it be like this, it makes no difference. The same will be the
process. Because you cannot wait, I change. I will allow you to wait
afterwards, and then there will be a second initiation. This is the
formal initiation, the second one will be informal. The second one will
be like a happening. You will not ask me, I will not give you. It will
happen. In the innermost being it will happen, and you will know it when
it happens.</p><p>Now there is no other way possible for this world, for this moment.
For this time</p><p>conscious mind, there is no other way. First I will push you, then I
will have to work on you. The working is also going to be quite
different. It cannot be the same. For example, I will have to work much
with your intellect, which was never before needed. It was always
thought of as a barrier. I also know it is a barrier, I also am aware
that nothing really can happen with the intellect. But I will have to
work and labor with your intellect, because now if someone says that
your intellect is not needed, this statement will be interpreted by your
intellect. You will be just disconnected with the person, there will be
no further intimacy. This will be a closing of the door. Today that
cannot be said. Of course, it is a basic truth, but it cannot be
uttered. It could be uttered in the old days.</p><p>Now I will have to do much with your intellect. And only when I have
worked with your intellect so much, in a way it has never before been
worked with, more than your capacity, only then will you be ready for
the statement, "Throw the intellect" -- not before. If you become
convinced -- and intellect becomes convinced very easily because it is a
very superficial part -- that whatsoever is said is rational only, then
I can begin with the irrational. There is the real beginning.</p><p>But to come to your heart I will have to go round and round through
your intellectual by-passes. The labyrinth of intellect has to be
traveled unnecessarily, but for this age that has become necessary. Now,
even the irrational will have to be found by a rational effort.</p><p>This period of waiting will be a training for the intellect toward
the beyond, and simultaneously I will force you and push you toward
meditation. In the old days meditation was very secret, very esoteric.
It would be given to you only when you were totally ready, because it is
the most secret key of the most secret treasure. It could only be given
when you were completely ready, otherwise it could not be given.</p><p>But if I wait for your readiness, it is not going to be given to you
at all. So I will give you a key -- of course, a false one. You can toy
with it, and with that you can wait. More than that key, the waiting
will help. Even with a false key, you will be more at ease. But the key
is made in such a way that if you go on using it, it will become an
authentic one. The key is made in such a way that if you go on using
it.â¦</p><p>It cannot unlock the door this very moment. They key is false, it has
corners</p><p>which it should not have. But if you go on trying with it, those
corners will fall down, will wither.</p><p>It will become a real key, and daily it will move more. I think you
understand me. I am not going to replace it with another key. The same
key will become authentic by much using. The unnecessary corners of it
will have withered. But I cannot wait for you to be ready to be given a
ready key which can open the door this very moment. The door is ready,
the key is ready, but you are not ready.</p><p>So there are two ways. The old way is that you should wait. I will
say, "Wait five years.</p><p>This is the key, that is the door, but wait for five years. Do not
ask again where is the key, do not touch the door even in curiosity, do
not go near the lock. Wait! Even if I see that you are looking at the
lock, I will turn you out. Just wait. Never look to the lock, never have
avarice. This is the key. I will give it to you when you are ready."
This was the old way. People waited for years. Even for lives people
have waited.</p><p>There is a story.â¦</p><p>One disciple waited for three lives. The teacher was experimenting
with him to see how much he could wait. He said, "I am going to know how
much you can wait."</p><p>The disciple said, "Okay, I will also see how much you can wait." It
is going to be a waiting for both; never think that it is going to be a
waiting for you alone. If you are waiting, I am also waiting. And I am
in more of a hurry than you because I may not be again." So the disciple
said, "Let us see who can wait more."</p><p>It became difficult for the teacher. He had to come for three lives
again, and the disciple waited. Each time he would come and sit, and
each time the same story was repeated.</p><p>In the end the teacher lost patience, and he said, "Take this key.
You have won; I am defeated."</p><p>The disciple said, "Why are you in such a hurry? I can wait still
more."</p><p>He said, "You can wait, but I have to come to this earth
unnecessarily for this waiting, and it looks as if you can continue
forever. So take this key."</p><p>But the disciple said, "The key has come to me because such long
waiting has itself become a key. I do not need it now."</p><p>The teacher said, "This was also one reason why I was in such a hurry
-- because if you wait still more there will be no need for the key to
be given! This very waiting will become a key."</p><p>This was the old way. Wait first, then the key will be given. Now
that is not possible, so I have to change the whole thing. I give you
the key, then you can play with it. You cannot wait unoccupied, but you
can wait occupied. Now you have the key, you have the lock, the door,
you have rumors about the treasury; you have everything. I go on
rumoring about the treasury. You have the key. You can wait, you can
play with the lock and key.</p><p>And by this very playing and waiting the false key will turn into an
authentic one.</p><p>The responsibility of the teacher corresponds to your surrender.
There are many other things the teacher does which are not in any
correspondence with the disciple. Only in one thing is the teacher in
correspondence with the disciple, that is the bridge. Surrender from the
disciple, responsibility from the teacher -- that is the bridge. There
are many things which are only with the teacher. Really, the disciple
has not to do much. The teacher has to do much. And that is right also,
that is how it should be. The disciple always thinks that he is doing
much, but it is the teacher who has to do much.</p><p>So he can just indicate something. He has to work with you on many
layers simultaneously. He has to work with your body, which you cannot
understand, because you are completely unaware of your body, you do not
know anything about your body.</p><p>You only know your body when you feel hungry, when you feel pain,
disease; that is all.</p><p>That is the only contact with your body. You do not know what a great
phenomenon your body is.</p><p>The teacher has to do much with your body, because unless your body
transforms, the innermost cannot be tackled. And he has to do it in such
a way that you should not become aware that he is doing something with
your body, because if you become aware, the very consciousness will
create disturbance in your body. And the teacher will not be able to do
it, because this is a secret phenomenon of the body; it works when you
are not conscious of it. If you become conscious, it will not work.</p><p>You can make an experiment. Tomorrow, be conscious when you are
eating, and then be conscious that the stomach is working to change the
food into living nourishment. Be conscious for twenty-four hours and you
will feel sick, your stomach will be disturbed.</p><p>You will not be able to be nourished by the food, it will become
poison. You will have to throw it away completely, the whole system will
be disturbed. That is why you need sleep. In sleep, the body can
function better. You are not conscious.</p><p>If someone is ill, the doctor will see first whether his sleep is
good. Otherwise no medicine will do, no help can be given. He cannot be
helped, because his body cannot work -- he is too conscious.
Unnecessarily, we continue so many diseases because of this
consciousness. Once your stomach is disturbed, you become conscious
about it. Then the stomach is all right, but the consciousness
continues; then this consciousness will disturb.</p><p>And this will become a vicious circle -- your consciousness is
disturbed by your stomach, and your stomach is disturbed by your
consciousness. Now you cannot be out of it. You will go on in it, and
this will become a lifelong thing.</p><p>One day your sleep is disturbed. Another day you are all right, but
now you have become conscious. Now you are thinking it may be that today
also sleep is not going to come.</p><p>Today you have become conscious. Sleep will not come, you are too
conscious. Now the next morning you will be even more conscious.</p><p>So with your body the teacher has to work many things which he cannot
tell you about.</p><p>Even a touch will be doing something. Even a hand on your head will
be doing</p><p>something. In the old world, with ancient people, it was very easy.
They were not so body conscious. With time consciousness there is a
corresponding corollary of body consciousness. I say it is death
consciousness. Really, the more you are death conscious, the more you
will be body conscious.</p><p>Today everyone has become so body conscious that you cannot touch him
without his becoming self-conscious. The moment he becomes
self-conscious, the touch, the inner meaning of it, the inner working of
is, has stopped. We have become so touchy, everyone is constantly aware
that no one should touch. You are standing in a crowd: everyone is
touching, but somewhere inside you are trying all the time not to be
touched. Things have become difficult in this way, unnecessarily
difficult.</p><p>In so many ways, I have to create devices in which your body can be
changed. In my meditation method, I have added a cathartic part only to
change your body center. No old meditation has this part added, because
that part can be done only by the teacher. His touching, just a single
touch on any center, could have so much catharsis. But now that is very
difficult.</p><p>For example, the Zen teacher will have a staff in his hand. He will
beat with his staff. No Westerner could understand what is the meaning
of it -- not even these who are sympathetic. And then, a Zen teacher
will not tell what is meant by it. It is not just a beating, it is
hammering on a particular center. It is not a beating at all. But it has
to be hidden. He is beating on your backbone, on a particular part. And
if he says to you, "I am touching on this center to help your body to
work in a particular way," you will become self-conscious. He will not
say that. He will say, "I feel that you are sleepy, so I beat you."
Whenever you will feel sleepy, he will come and beat you, and this
beating is a hidden trick to camouflage the whole affair. You will
think, "He is beating me." You will not become aware of the center he
has hammered. Now that too cannot be used.</p><p>Asanas are used to change your inner current. Mudras were used, but
they all have to be practised a long time. No one can practise so long
now. And they have to be practised in a very isolated atmosphere, not in
the marketplace, because when you practise particular asanas and mudras,
the particular centers become so sensitive that you must remain
isolated. Otherwise you will get many unnecessary disturbing influences
inside -- because your centers are open.</p><p>So the teacher has much to do with your body in so many methods. It
is always</p><p>up to him to devise new methods, because old methods become useless.
This is because the more you know, the more you become self-conscious.
So new methods are to be used, and only the enlightened ones can use new
methods. All those who are initiating and are not enlightened
themselves, will have to rely on old methods, because they cannot devise
the new. they do not even know what is meant by the old. They know only
the outer gestures.</p><p>So they will continue to use hatha yoga, pranayam; they will
continue. With every new enlightened person, this world gets new
devices. Otherwise it cannot get new devices, and each new age needs new
devices because the mind has changed.</p><p>So the teacher has to do much with your body; that is the beginning.
And the difficult part of it is that you must no be aware of it. That is
why it is meaningful to live with a teacher, to live in an ashram, to
sleep with a teacher -- because then your body is more vulnerable for
his work, without your knowing. Teachers have even used intoxicants to
make you unconscious, to work with your body. Anesthetics are not only
used by surgeons.</p><p>Teachers have also used them in their own way. When you are
completely unaware, then they can work. And the work which cannot be
done in a year ordinarily can be done in a moment, because then the
exact point can be touched, turned, changed. The whole current can be
made different.</p><p>Then things become even more difficult, because the energy that is to
be used lies in the sex center. It becomes even more difficult. That too
is a part of the whole complex. I am talking about time consciousness,
death consciousness, sex consciousness, these are all parts. The more
you become death conscious, the more you feel sexual -- because sex is
the antidote. Sex is the beginning of life, and death is the end. If you
are more conscious of death, you will become more conscious of sex. Only
a society which is not conscious of death will be unconscious of sex. It
does not mean that it will not be sexual, but it will be unconscious of
it. It will be just a natural thing.</p><p>You can go to a primitive society and touch the breast of a woman and
ask her what it is.</p><p>She will just reply in an automatic way; no reference to any
morality, no reference to any body consciousness, no reference to sex.
She will say that this is</p><p>to give the milk to the child.</p><p>The energy lies in the sex center. And we have become so conscious of
the sex center, we guard it so continuously and we have become so tense,
it goes on being more and more difficult to help. I have created many
new devices, and I have to talk about very different things from so many
dimensions. For example, I have talked so much about moving from sex to
superconsciousness only to relax you. If you can become relaxed at your
sex center, if there is no tension, then the energy can be released
upwards.</p><p>The first thing for the initiator is to help your body change. It has
to be changed, because a new phenomenon is going to happen to your body.
It has to be prepared for the new explosion which is going to come,
which is going to descend, for the new energy which will soon be your
guest. So you have to be made a host. The whole arrangement has to be
changed.</p><p>This arrangement, as we exist ordinarily, will not do. This is a
biological arrangement.</p><p>This structure of the body, this pattern of the body, is biological.
It is used only as a sex vehicle. The whole process is just to continue
it. Nothing more is expected from your body as far as nature is
concerned, so it is arranged in that way. Now you want not only to
continue the race, you want to change the whole biological process and
to create a new dimension that is absolutely non- biological, spiritual.
The whole structure of the body will have to be changed.</p><p>So the teacher has to work more with your body, then much with your
emotions, and now even much with your intellect. This is the conscious,
exoteric part. The teacher is going to do something to the outer parts
in initiation. But there is the inner part, the esoteric. That is being
worked on by telepathic messages, through your dreams, through visions,
through secret communications. Your intellect can be pacified directly.
It can be talked to and pacified directly, but not your emotions, here
one has to work indirectly. One has to create milieus through which your
emotions are changed, transformed.</p><p>But that too is outer. Your emotions, your intellect, your body,
these are the outer self of your body. You reside within, your being is
deeper inside. That being is also to be transformed. That is being done
through telepathic, through esoteric, secret paths. Your dreams can be
used, they are used. It happens ordinarily that</p><p>you may not be aware of your dreams, but your teacher is. And he is
more interested in your dreams than your waking state. Your so-called
waking consciousness is false. It is not real, you are not expressed in
it; you only act. Your dreams are more real.</p><p>Freud just used analysis of dreams because of some alchemical
tradition which became known to him. Something from some esoteric circle
leaked. He used it and created a whole science. Of course, he could not
know your dreams directly; he had to make you confess, show your dream,
remember your dream, talk about your dream. Then he could analyze it.
But in initiation the teacher knows your dreams. He can go into your
dreams, he can be a witness to your dreams. And then he knows more
secret things about you then you yourself are aware.</p><p>Edgar Cayce could go into an auto-hypnotic coma in which you tell him
something about your dream. There are your missing links. He could go
into the dream in his unconscious state. He could see the whole picture
of your dream. Then he would tell you that these are the missing links,
this is your full dream. And you will be surprised that no one remembers
his full dream in the morning -</p><p>- it is impossible.</p><p>The moment the conscious mind takes charge it distorts the whole
thing, because the message is from the unconscious. It is against the
conscious, it distorts, it interprets. It causes something to be
missing, something to be added, and the whole thing becomes just
nonsense. You say this is just a dream -- meaningless. No dream is
meaningless; dreams have a deeper meaning than your waking moments.</p><p>So the teacher has to work with your dreams. And unless he works with
your dreams, he cannot work for your awakening, because the
dream-creating source inside you is the whole thing. It has to be
destroyed, it has to be uprooted from your consciousness. The complete
mechanism of dreaming has to be broken, completely uprooted. When it is
uprooted completely, first you will feel that you have lost dreaming,
then you will feel that you have lost sleep. You will sleep, but
something will remain aware. The body will be refreshed in the morning,
but you will know that you have remained conscious. If dreaming is lost,
sleep will be lost.</p><p>You may be surprised that the dreaming is a constant help to sleep.
You cannot sleep without dreaming. Dreaming helps to continue your
sleep. For example,</p><p>you are feeling hungry in sleep, then the sleep will be broken. The
body will break it, "Go and take something!" You are feeling thirsty;
the body will say, "Go and drink something." But the dream structure
will help completely; it will say, "Okay." The dream structure will
create a dream. You are drinking water in the dream, then there is no
need to break the sleep.</p><p>You have taken something which was needed. The dream has substituted,
and now you can continue sleeping.</p><p>Your alarm clock is ringing, it is five o'clock and you have to rise.
The dream structure will create a dream. You are in a temple, and a bell
is ringing. The alarm ringing outside has been transferred and made a
part of the dream. Now the bell is ringing in the temple, now there is
no need to rise, you can continue sleeping.</p><p>The dream is a help for continuing sleep; otherwise you cannot sleep.
The sleep will be broken so many times, because there are so many
happenings outside that the body cannot tolerate. Even a single mosquito
will disturb your sleep, but the dream can help there also. It may
create a dream, and the music of the mosquito will become a music in the
dream. Then you continue to sleep and dream.</p><p>So the whole structure of dreaming consciousness has to be uprooted,
and the teacher has to work for it. And when he destroys the whole
mechanism of dreaming, then only the inner doors are open and he can
communicate directly. Now there is no need of language, no need of
words. He can communicate directly. And when there is direct
communication without words, only the truth can be revealed to you,
otherwise not. So the most esoteric part is with your dreaming
consciousness -- to change it.</p><p>Something may leak out, and there has been such a phenomenon so many
times. There are even sciences based on a single leak, a single point
that has come from the esoteric world. You can create a science on it.
It is going to be faulty, always imperfect. Freud's analysis can never
be perfect because he does not know the whole thing. He has come upon,
he has stumbled somewhere, on a single point. He has worked it out
completely, but the point itself is a part. The whole is not known.</p><p>When dreaming consciousness has been washed away, then the real
esoteric work begins.</p><p>The teacher can take your hand in his hand and lead you anywhere --
to any reality, to any depth of this universe. But that cannot be talked
about, that cannot be discussed.</p><p>Teachers have lead their pupils to heaven, hell, to every nook and
corner of the universe, to every planet, to higher realms. But that can
only happen when your dreaming consciousness is gone completely. You
cannot project anything, you have just to become a screen. Then this
world will be different for you because then you will be different.</p><p>This world will remain the same, but you will not be projecting
anything.</p><p>And there still are many things for which, if you are interested, you
will have to go in.</p><p>You cannot be informed about these things. They can be made known to
you. I can help you, I can work with you, I can push you into an inner
dimension. But I cannot inform you. Even all I am informing you of is
more than ever allowed. But I can inform you about many things which
were never allowed because I always drop some key points.</p><p>You cannot work them up.</p><p>Something is always missing -- not to me, but to you. It is always
missing unless the phenomenon happens to you. Then everything will be
complete, it will be linked. So I talk about many links. There are
always some missing links which will be fulfilled only by your efforts.
I talk about these unlinked links so that you may be persuaded to work
hard. The more you work hard, the more missing links I will talk about.
But the chief link will never be talked about. It can only be
experienced. But I am ready to help you to experience it, and the nature
of things is such that it can only be experienced.</p><p>Do your part, and remember that you are capable of doing your part.
Whenever you are able to surrender, the teacher will come. The teacher
is there. Teachers have always been in existence. The world has never
lacked teachers, it has always lacked disciples. But no teacher can
begin anything unless someone surrenders. So whenever you have a moment
to surrender, do not lose it. Even if you do not find anyone to whom to
surrender, then just surrender to existence. But whenever there is a
moment to surrender, do not lose it, because then you are on the
borderline where you are in between sleep and waking. Just
surrender!</p><p>If you can find someone, that is good. If you cannot find anyone,
just surrender to the universe. And the teacher will appear, he will
come. He rushes whenever there is surrender. You become vacant, you
become empty; spiritually, you become empty. Then the spiritual force
rushes toward you and fills you. So always remember that whenever you
feel like surrendering, do not lose the moment. It may not come again or
it may come after centuries and lives have been unnecessarily wasted.
Whenever the moment comes, just surrender.</p><p>But the mind has a trick. If you are angry, you will be angry that
very moment. But if you feel like surrendering. you will think about it,
you will plan about it, you will wait. And with the mind, it is always
only in a moment when it is on the boundary. So just surrender to the
divine, to anything, even to a tree, because the real thing is not to
whom you surrender -- the real thing is surrendering. Surrender to a
tree, and the tree will become a teacher to you. Many things will be
revealed to you from the tree which no scripture can reveal to you.</p><p>Surrender to a stone, and the stone will become a god. And the stone
will reveal things which no god can reveal to you. The real thing is
surrendering. Whenever there is surrendering, one always appears who
becomes responsible for you. This is what is meant by initiation.</p><p>I Am the Gate Chapter #8</p><p>Â </p><div class=toc><p><a href=part1 class=toc0>Chapter title: I am the gate</a></p></div><p>Â Â </p><p>Â </p><p><a href=part1>Next ></a></p><p>Â Â </p></div><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Chapter title: I am the gate</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>&lt; Previous | Contents

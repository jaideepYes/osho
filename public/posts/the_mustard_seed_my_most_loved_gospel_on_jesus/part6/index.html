ONE OF THEM WENT ASTRAY WHICH WAS THE LARGEST.\nHE LEFT BEHIND THE NINETY-NINE, HE SOUGHT FOR THE ONE UNTIL HE FOUND IT.\nHAVING TIRED HIMSELF OUT, HE SAID TO THE SHEEP: I LOVE THEE MORE THAN THE NINETY-NINE.\nOne of the most puzzling problems has been: what will happen to the sinners, those who have gone astray? What is the relationship between the divine and the sinner? Is the sinner going to be punished? Is there going to be a hell? ... Because all the priests have been insisting that the sinner is going to be thrown into hell, he is to be punished. But can God punish anybody? Is there not compassion enough? And if God cannot forgive, then who will be able to forgive?\nMany answers have been given, but Jesus’ answer is the most beautiful. Before we enter into this saying many other things have to be understood; they will give you the background.\nWhenever we punish a person, whatsoever rationalizations we may like to make, our reasons are different; and remember the distinction between reason and rationalization. You may be a father or a mother, and your child has done something of which you don’t approve. It doesn’t matter whether he has done something right or wrong, because who knows what is right and what is wrong? But\nyou disapprove and whatsoever you disapprove of becomes wrong. It may be, it may not be, that is not the point – whatsoever you approve of is right. So it depends on your approval and disapproval.\nAnd when a child goes astray, is doing something wrong in your view, you punish him. The deep reason is that he has disobeyed, not that he has done something wrong; the deep reason is that your ego feels hurt. The child has been in conflict with you, he has asserted himself. He has said no to you, the father, the authority, the powerful one, so you punish the child. The reason is that your ego is hurt and punishment is a sort of revenge.\nBut the rationalization is different: you say that it is because he has done wrong and he has to be put right – unless he is punished how is he going to be put right? So he should be punished when he moves in a wrong way, and he should be rewarded when he follows you. That’s how he is to be conditioned for a right life. This is the rationalization, this is how you talk about it in your mind, but this is not the basic unconscious reason.\nThe unconscious reason is totally different: it is to put the child in his place, to remind him that you are the boss and he is not the boss, that you will decide what is wrong and what is right, that it is you who are going to give him direction; that he is not free, that you possess him, that you are the owner – and if he disobeys then he will suffer.\nIf you ask the Depth Psychologists they will say that in all behavior this distinction between reason and the rationalization has to be understood well. Rationalization is a very cunning device – it hides the real reason and gives a false thing to you, but looks absolutely okay on the surface. And this is happening not only between a father and a child, a mother and a child, it is also happening between society and those children who have gone astray. That’s why prison exists, the law exists – it is a revenge, a revenge taken by society.\nSociety cannot tolerate somebody who is rebellious, because he will destroy the whole structure. He may be right: Athens could not tolerate Socrates, not because he was wrong – he was absolutely right – but Athens could not tolerate him because if he had been tolerated then the whole structure of the society would have gone, been thrown to the dogs; then the society could not have existed. So Socrates had to be sacrificed to society.\nAnd Jesus was crucified, not because whatsoever he was saying was wrong – never have such true words been asserted on this earth – but he was sacrificed to the society because the way he was talking, the way he was behaving, was dangerous to the structure.\nSociety cannot tolerate this so it will punish you. But it also rationalizes: it says this is just to put you right, it punishes you for your own good. And nobody ever bothers whether that good is ever achieved or not. We have been punishing criminals for thousands of years, but nobody bothers whether those criminals are ever transformed through our punishment or not. Criminals go on increasing: as prisons increase, prisoners increase; the more laws, the more criminals; the more courts, the more punishments. The result is absolutely absurd – more criminality.\nWhat is the problem? The criminal can also feel that it is a rationalization, that he is punished for doing wrong – really he is punished because he has been caught. So he also has his rationalization: next time he has to be more cunning and more clever, that’s all. This time he has been caught\nbecause he was not alert, not because he has done wrong. Society proved more clever than him, so next time he will see – he is going to prove himself more cunning, clever, intelligent, and then he will not be caught. A prisoner, a criminal who is punished always thinks that he is punished, not for the thing he has committed, but because he has been caught. So the only thing he is going to learn from the punishment is not to be caught again.\nSo whenever a prisoner comes out of prison he is a better criminal than ever: he has lived with experienced people inside the prison, with more advanced adepts who know much, who have been punished much and who have suffered long – who have been caught – and who have been deceiving in many, many ways; who are very advanced on the path of crime. Living with them, serving them, becoming a disciple to them, he learns; he learns through experience that next time he is not to be caught. Then he is a better criminal.\nNobody is stopped by punishment, but society goes on thinking that it is because the wrong has to be stopped that we punish. Both are wrong: society has some other reason – it takes revenge. And the criminal, he also understands – because egos understand each other’s language very easily, howsoever unconscious – the criminal also thinks, “Okay, I will take revenge when my time comes, I will see.” Then a conflict exists between the criminal’s ego and society’s ego.\nIs God the same? – just like a justice, a magistrate, just like a father or a boss? Is God also cruel in the same way as society is? Is God also the same deep down, an egoist as we are? Will he take revenge if you disobey? Will he punish you? Then he is no longer divine, then he is just an ordinary man like us.\nThis is one of the profoundest problems: how will God behave with a sinner who has gone astray? Will he be kind? Then there are other things implied. And if he wants to be just, he cannot have compassion, because justice and compassion cannot exist together. Compassion means unconditional forgiveness, but it is not just, because it is possibleA saint prayed continuously his\nwhole life, never did anything wrong; was always afraid of moving beyond the boundary, lived in his own confinement, created an imprisonment for himself; never did anything wrong, remained virtuous his whole life; never allowed himself any enjoyment of the senses, was very austere. And then there was another man who lived, indulged, did whatsoever came to his mind; went wherever his senses led him, enjoyed whatsoever the world gave; did all types of things, all types of sins – and then both reached the divine, both reached God’s world.\nWhat will happen? If the saint is not rewarded and the sinner is not punished, it will be very unjust. If both are rewarded, that too will be unjust, because the saint will think: “I have lived a good life, but nothing special is given to me for it.” If the sinner is also rewarded in the same way, then what is the use of being a saint? The whole thing becomes futile. Then God may be compassionate, but he is not just.\nIf he is just, then the arithmetic will be clear in our minds: the sinner has to be punished, the saint has to be rewarded. But then he cannot have compassion – a just man has to be cruel because otherwise justice cannot be done. A just man has to live in the head, not in the heart.\nA magistrate should not have a heart, otherwise his justice will waver. He should not have any kindness in him, because kindness will become a barrier to doing justice. A man who is just must\nbecome like a computer, just a head: laws, rewards, punishments – no heart enters into it, no feeling should be allowed. He should remain a spectator, unfeeling, as if there is no heart in him. But then a difficult problem arises, because for centuries we have been saying that God is both just and compassionate; kind, loving, and yet just. Then it is a contradiction, a paradox – how to solve it?\nJesus has one answer, and the most beautiful. Now try to understand his answer. It will be difficult because it will go against all your preconceptions, against all your prejudices, because Jesus is not a believer in punishment. Nobody like Jesus can be a believer in punishment, because deep down punishment is revenge. A Buddha, a Krishna, a Jesus, they cannot believe in punishment. Rather, on the contrary, they can drop the very quality of justice from God. But compassion cannot be dropped, because justice is a human ideal, compassion is divine. Justice has conditions attached to it: “Do this and you will achieve this. Don’t do that, otherwise you will miss this.” Compassion has no conditions.\nGod is compassionate. And to understand his compassion we have to start from the sinner.\nJESUS SAID: THE KINGDOM IS LIKE A SHEPHERD WHO HAD ONE HUNDRED SHEEP. ONE OF THEM WENT ASTRAY, WHICH WAS THE LARGEST. HE LEFT BEHIND THE NINETY-NINE, HE SOUGHT FOR THE ONE UNTIL HE FOUND IT. HAVING TIRED HIMSELF OUT, HE SAID TO THE SHEEP: I LOVE THEE MORE THAN THE NINETY-NINE.\nAbsurd, illogical – but true. Try to understand: THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS LIKE A SHEPHERD WHO HAD ONE HUNDRED SHEEP. ONE OF THEM WENT ASTRAY, WHICH WAS THE\nLARGEST. It is always so – the one who goes astray is always the best. If you are a father and you have five children, only the best child will try to resist and deny you, only the best child will assert himself. The mediocre ones will always yield to you, but the one who is not mediocre will rebel, because the very quality of his mind is rebellious. Intelligence is rebellious: the more intelligent, the more rebellious. And those who are not rebellious, who are yea-sayers, are almost dead; you may like them, but they have no life in them. They follow you not because they love you, they follow you because they are weak, they are afraid, they cannot stand alone, they cannot stand against – they are weaklings, impotent.\nLook around: people whom you think are good are almost always those who are weak. Their goodness does not come out of their strength, it comes out of their weakness. They are good because they cannot dare to be bad. But what type of goodness is this which comes out of weakness? Goodness must come out of overflowing strength, only then is it good, because then it has life, a floodlike life.\nSo whenever a sinner becomes a saint, the saintliness has its own glory. But whenever an ordinary man becomes a saint because of his weakness, the saintliness is pale and dead, there is no life in it. You can become a saint out of weakness – but remember, then you will miss. Only if you become a saint out of your strength will you reach. A man who is good because he cannot be bad is not really good. The moment he becomes stronger he will become bad; give him power and power will corrupt him immediately.\nThis happened in this country: Gandhi had a great following, but it seems that the goodness of his followers came out of weakness. They were good when they were not in power, but when they came to power, when they became the rulers of this country, then the power corrupted them immediately.\nCan power corrupt a powerful man? Never, because he is already powerful. If power could corrupt him, power would have corrupted him already! Power corrupts only if you are weak and your goodness comes out of weakness. Lord Acton has said, “Power corrupts and corrupts absolutely!” But I would like to make it conditional; this statement is not unconditional, not categorical, it cannot be. Power corrupts if goodness comes out of weakness; if goodness comes out of strength, no power can corrupt. How can power corrupt if you know it already, when it is there already? But it is very difficult to find from where your goodness comes. If you are not a thief because you are afraid of being caught, the day you become certain that now nobody can catch you, you will become a thief – because then who will prevent you? Only your fear was preventing you; you were not going to murder your enemy because you knew you would be caught. But if a situation arises where you can murder the man and you cannot be caught, you cannot be punished for it, you will murder him immediately. So it is only through weakness that you are good.\nBut how can goodness arise out of weakness? Goodness needs overflowing energy. Goodness is a luxury, remember, saintliness is a luxury – it comes out of affluence. When there is too much energy, so much that you are flooded with it, then you start sharing it. Then you cannot exploit because there is no need. Then you can give out of your heart because you have so much that really you are burdened. You would like to share and renounce, you would like to throw everything and give all your life as a gift.\nWhen you have something you would like to give it – remember this law: you cling to something only when you don’t really own it; if you own it you can give it. Only when you can give something happily are you the owner. If you are still clinging to it, then deep down you are afraid and you are not the master of it. You know deep down that it does not belong to you, and sooner or later it will be taken away from you. That is why you cannot give. So only when a person gives his love does he show that he has love; only when a person gives his whole life does he show that he is alive. There is no other way to know it.\nOut of weakness much goodness appears. It is an appearance, it is a false coin, and a false coin is just like a paper flower or a plastic flower. Whenever a tree flowers it flowers only because it is flooded with too much energy. Flowers are luxuries – a tree flowers only when it can afford to. If water is not given in the right proportion, if fertilizers are not given in the right proportion, if the soil is not rich, then the tree may have leaves but it cannot have flowers.\nThere is a hierarchy: the highest can exist only when there is energy to move to the highest. If you are not fed well, intelligence will disappear first because that is a flowering. In a poor country the real poverty is not of the body, the real poverty is of intelligence, because if the country is very poor intelligence cannot exist – it is a flowering. Only when all the bodily needs are fulfilled does energy move higher; when the bodily needs are not fulfilled, the energy moves to fulfill the bodily needs first, because the base has to be protected first, the root has to be protected first. If there is no root there cannot be any flowering; if there is no body then where will the intelligence exist? And compassion is even higher than intelligence, and meditation still higher.\nIn India, Buddha and Mahavira were produced when the country was very rich. Since then so-called saints have existed, but not a man like Buddha. Difficult, very difficult – because such a flowering is possible only when there is useless energy, energy which cannot be used; only then does the energy start enjoying itself. And when energy starts enjoying itself it begins to turn inwards, it becomes an inner turning. Then it becomes meditation, then a Buddha is born, then ecstasy exists.\nDon’t give water to the tree and first the flowers will disappear, then the leaves will disappear; then the branches will die and only at the last moment will the roots die – because with roots things can come up again, so the tree will protect its roots. The root is the lowest, but the lowest has to be protected because it is the foundation. When good days come, when the rains come and there is water, then again the root can sprout, again the leaves will come, and again there will be a flowering. This same hierarchy exists in you.\nBe good out of your energy, never be good out of your weakness. I am not saying be bad... because out of weakness, how can you be either? Badness needs energy as much as goodness. You cannot be bad, you cannot be evil without energy, and you cannot be good without energy – because both are real. Then what can you be without energy? You can just have a false face: you will not be anything, you will just be a facade, a deception, a ghost, not a real person – whatsoever you do will be ghostlike. And this is what is happening. Then you will create a false goodness, a false saintliness. You will think you are a saint because you have not committed any sin, not because you have attained the divine.\nWhen you attain the divine it is an achievement, a positive energy achievement. Then you become godlike, and then there is no effort to be godlike – it flows spontaneously. You can resist being bad, but that is negative. When you resist, the desire is there; and if the desire is there to do evil, you have committed it – it makes no difference. That is the difference between sin and crime.\nCrime has to be an act. You can go on thinking about committing crime, but no court can punish you because no court has authority over the mind, only over the body – a crime has to be an act. I can go on thinking of murdering the whole world, but no court can punish me just because I go on thinking about it. I can say I enjoy it, but I have not murdered anybody, it has not become an act. Action comes under the law, not thought, and this is the difference between crime and sin.\nSin doesn’t make any distinction between your acts and your thoughts: if you think, the seed is there; whether it sprouts in the act or not is not the problem. If it becomes an act then it will be a crime. But if you have thought it you have already committed the sin – for the divine you have become a criminal, you have gone astray. But this is the point to be understood, a very difficult one: that those who go astray are always more powerful than those who remain on the path.\nThose who go astray are always the best. Go to a madhouse and see: you will find the most intelligent people have gone mad. Look at the past seventy years of this century: the most intelligent people have gone mad, not the mediocre ones. Nietzsche, one of the best intelligences ever born, went mad, had to go mad – he had so much energy; so much energy that it could not be confined, so much energy that it had to become a flood; it could not be a gentle stream, he could not channel it – it was like an ocean, wild. Nietzsche went mad, Nijinsky went mad. Look at the seventy years of this century and you will find the best, the cream, the very best went mad, and the mediocrities were sane.\nThis looks very absurd: mediocrities are sane and genius goes mad. Why does a mediocre person remain sane? No energy to move astray. A child becomes a problem child when he has overflowing energy, he has to do something or other. Only a bloodless child remains in the corner; if you say to him, “Repeat Ram, Ram, Ram,” he will repeat it, if you give him a rosary he will do it. But if the child is really alive then he will throw away the rosary and he will say, “This is stupid! I’m going to play and I’m going to climb in the trees, I’m going to do something!”\nLife is energy. Only a bloodless, anemic mind will not go astray, cannot, because it is difficult to afford that much energy, it is difficult to move to that extreme, to that abyss. But those who go astray – if they are ever found – they become buddhas. If Nietzsche had ever gone into meditation he would have become a buddha. He had the energy to become mad, so he had the energy to become enlightened – it is the same energy, only the direction changes. A potential buddha will become mad if he is not going to become a buddha – where will the energy go? If you cannot be creative, energy becomes destructive. Go to the madhouses: you will find the most intelligent men there; they are mad only because they are not mediocre; they are mad because they can see further than you, deeper than you. And when they see deeper than you, illusions disappear.\nThe whole of life is such a puzzling thing that if you can see deeper it will be very difficult to remain sane, very difficult. One remains sane because one cannot see: you see only two percent of life, and ninety-eight percent, psychologists say, has been closed, because if you come to see it, it will be such a flood that you will not be able to tolerate it – you will go insane, berserk.\nNow a few psychologists, those who have been studying madness very deeply, like R.D.Laing and others, are stumbling on certain facts. One of the facts is this: that people who go mad are the best, people who go into crime are the most rebellious. They can become great saints and it is not a surprise if a Valmiki becomes a saint. Valmiki was a dacoit, a murderer, he lived by murder and loot. A sudden happening – and he became enlightened.\nOne enlightened person was passing, and Valmiki, a murderer, a man who lived by theft, caught hold of this enlightened man. The enlightened man said, “What are you going to do?”\nValmiki said, “I am going to rob you of all that you have!”\nThe enlightened man said, “If you could do that I would be happy, because I have something very inner – steal it, you are welcome!”\nValmiki could not understand it, but he said, “I am concerned only with outward things.” The enlightened man said, “But they won’t help much. And why are you doing this?”\nValmiki replied, “Because of my family, for my family – my mother, my wife, my children – they will starve if I don’t do this; and I only know this art.”\nSo the enlightened man said, “Bind me to a tree so I cannot escape, and go back and tell your mother and your wife and your children that you are committing sin for them. Ask them if they are ready to share the punishment. When you are before God, when the last judgment comes, will they be ready to share the punishment?”\nFor the first time Valmiki started thinking. He said, “You may be right. I should go and ask.”\nHe went back, asked his wife, and she said, “Why should I share the punishment? I have not done anything. If you do anything it’s your responsibility.”\nAnd his mother said, “Why should I share it? I am your mother, it is your duty to feed me. I don’t know how you bring the bread, that’s your responsibility.”\nNobody was ready to share the punishment – and Valmiki became converted. He came back, fell at the feet of the enlightened man and said, “Now give me the inner, I’m not interested in the outer. Now let me be the robber of the inner, because I have understood that I am alone and whatsoever I do, it is my responsibility, nobody is going to share it. I am born alone, I will die alone, and whatsoever I do is my individual personal responsibility; nobody is going to share it. So now I must look inwards and find who I am. Finished! I am finished with this whole business!” This man was converted in a second.\nThe same story happened with Buddha. There was one man who was almost mad, a mad murderer. He had taken a vow that he would kill one thousand people, not less than that, because the society had not treated him well. He would take his revenge by killing one thousand people. And from every person killed he would take one finger and make a rosary around his neck – one thousand fingers. Because of this his name became Angulimala: the man with a rosary of fingers.\nHe killed nine hundred and ninety-nine people. Nobody would move in those parts; wherever people came to know that Angulimala was, the traffic would stop. And then it became very difficult for him to find one man, and only one more man was needed.\nBuddha was passing a forest; people came to him from the villages and they said, “Don’t go! Angulimala is there, that mad murderer! He doesn’t think twice, he simply murders; and he will not think that you are a buddha. Don’t go that way; there is another way, you can move by that one, but don’t go through this forest!”\nBuddha said, “If I don’t go, then who will go? And he is waiting for one more, so I have to go.”\nAngulimala had almost completed his vow. And he was a man of energy because he was fighting the whole society: only one man – and he had killed a thousand people. And kings were afraid of him, generals were afraid, and the government and the law and the police – nobody could do anything. But Buddha said, “He is a man, he needs me. I must take the risk. Either he will kill me or I will kill him.” This is what buddhas do: they stake, they risk their lives. Buddha went. Even the closest disciples who had said that they would remain with him up to the very end, they started lagging behind – because this was dangerous!\nSo when Buddha reached the hill where Angulimala was sitting on a rock, there was no one behind him, he was alone. All the disciples had disappeared. Angulimala looked at this innocent man; childlike, so beautiful, he thought, that even a murderer felt compassion for him. He thought, “This man seems to be absolutely unaware that I am here, otherwise nobody goes along this path.” And the man looked so innocent, so beautiful, that even Angulimala thought, “It is not good to kill this man. I’ll leave him, I can find somebody else.”\nThen he said to Buddha, “Go back! Stop there now and go back! Don’t move a step forward! I am Angulimala, and these are nine hundred and ninety-nine fingers here, and I need one finger more – even if my mother comes I will kill her and fulfill my vow! So don’t come near, I’m dangerous! And I am not a believer in religion, I’m not bothered who you are. You may be a very good monk, a great saint maybe, but I don’t care! I only care about the finger, and your finger is as good as anybody else’s so don’t come a single step further, otherwise I will kill you. Stop!” But Buddha continued moving.\nThen Angulimala thought, “Either this man is deaf or mad!” He again shouted, “Stop! Don’t move!”\nBuddha said, “I stopped long ago; I am not moving, Angulimala, you are moving. I stopped long ago. All movement has stopped because all motivation has stopped. When there is no motivation, how can movement happen? There is no goal for me, I have achieved the goal so why should I move? You are moving – and I say to you: you stop!”\nAngulimala was sitting on the rock and he started laughing. He said, “You are really mad! I am sitting and you say to me that I am moving, and you are moving and you say that you have stopped. You are really a fool or mad – or I don’t know what type, what manner of man you are!”\nBuddha came near and he said, “I have heard that you need one more finger. As far as this body is concerned, my goal is achieved, this body is useless. When I die people will burn it, it will be of no use to anyone. You can use it, your vow can be fulfilled: cut off my finger and cut off my head. I have come on purpose because this is the last chance for my body to be used in some way; otherwise people will burn it.”\nAngulimala said, “What are you saying? I thought that I was the only madman around here. And don’t try to be clever because I am dangerous, I can still kill you!”\nBuddha said, “Before you kill me, do one thing, just the wish of a dying man: cut off a branch of this tree.” Angulimala hit his sword against the tree and a big branch fell down. Buddha said, “Just one thing more: join it again to the tree!”\nAngulimala said, “Now I know perfectly that you are mad – I can cut but I cannot join.”\nThen Buddha started laughing and he said, “When you can only destroy and cannot create, you should not destroy because destruction can be done by children, there is no bravery in it. This branch can be cut by a child, but to join it a master is needed. And if you cannot even join back a branch to the tree, how can you cut off human heads? Have you ever thought about it?”\nAngulimala closed his eyes, fell down at Buddha’s feet, and he said, “You lead me on that path!” And it is said that in a single moment he became enlightened.\nNext day he was a bhikkhu, a beggar, Buddha’s beggar, and begging in the city. The whole city was closed. People were so afraid, they said, “Even if he has become a beggar he cannot be believed. That man is so dangerous!” People were not out on the roads. When Angulimala came to beg nobody was there to give him food, because who would take the risk? People were standing on their terraces looking down. And then they started throwing stones at him because he had killed nine hundred and ninety-nine men of that town. Almost every family had been a victim, so they started throwing stones.\nAngulimala fell down on the street, blood was flowing from all over his body, he had many wounds. And Buddha came with his disciples and he said, “Look! Angulimala, how are you feeling?”\nAngulimala opened his eyes and said, “I am so grateful to you. They can kill the body but they cannot touch me, and that is what I was doing my whole life and never realized the fact.”\nBuddha said, “Angulimala has become enlightened, he has become a brahmin, a knower of Brahma.”\nIt can happen in a single moment if the energy is there. If the energy is not there, then it is difficult. The whole system of yoga is how to create energy, more energy. The whole dynamics of tantra is how to create more energy in you, so you become a floodlike phenomenon. Then you can become good or bad.\nJESUS SAYS: ONE OF THEM WENT ASTRAY, WHICH WAS THE LARGEST.\nOnly those who are great, who are the best, go astray. The sinners are the most beautiful people in the world – gone wrong, of course. They can become saints any moment. Saints are beautiful, sinners are beautiful, but the people who are just in between, they are ugly... because impotence is the only ugliness: when you don’t have any energy, when you are already a dead thing, a corpse, somehow carrying yourself, or having others carry you.\nWhy do the best, why do the great go astray? There is a secret to be understood: the process of growth is that first you have to attain the ego. If you don’t attain to a crystallized ego surrender is never possible. Looks paradoxical, but this is how it is. First, you have to attain a very crystallized ego, and then you have to drop it. If you don’t attain to a crystallized ego, surrender can never happen to you. How can you surrender something which you have not got?\nA rich man can renounce his riches, but what should a beggar do? He has no riches to renounce. A great scholar can throw his intellect, but what will a mediocre person do? How can he throw it when he has not got it? If you have knowledge you can renounce it and become ignorant, humble; but if you don’t have any knowledge, how can you renounce it?\nSocrates could say, “I don’t know anything.” This is the second part: he knew much, then he realized that all knowledge is useless. But this cannot be attained by a person who has not moved like Socrates. The intellect has to be trained, knowledge has to be gained, the ego has to be crystallized; this is the first part of life. When you have the riches, then you can renounce them – the difference is great.\nA beggar on the street and Buddha on the street are both beggars, but the quality differs absolutely: Buddha is a beggar by his own will. He is not forced to be a beggar, it is his freedom. Buddha is a beggar because he has tasted riches and found them futile; Buddha is a beggar because he has lived through desire and found it futile, useless. Buddha is a beggar because the kingdom of this world has failed. So Buddha’s beggary has a richness about it – no king can be so rich, because he is still half way round and Buddha has completed the circle.\nBut a beggar who has never been rich also standing on the road... his begging is simply begging, because he does not know the taste of riches. How can he renounce a desire which he has not fulfilled? How can he say that palaces are useless? He has no experience of them. How can he say that beautiful women are worthless? He cannot say that because he has not known beautiful women. Only experience can give you the key to renounce. Without experience you can console yourself, and many poor people, poor in many ways, do that.\nIf you don’t have a beautiful wife you go on saying, “What is there? The body is just the body, and the body is mortal and it is the abode of death.” But deep down, deep down the desire remains, and desire can go only when experience has happened, when you have come to know – this is a consolation. A poor man can console himself that there is nothing in palaces, but he knows there is; otherwise, why is everybody mad for riches? And he himself is obsessed and mad: in his dreams he lives in palaces, in his dreams he becomes the emperor. But in the daytime, when he is a beggar on the street, he goes on saying, “I don’t bother, I don’t care, I have renounced!” This consolation is of no use; it is dangerous, it is false.\nThe first part of life for a rightly maturing person is to attain the ego; and the second part, then the circle becomes complete, is to renounce it.\nA child grows only when he resists his parents, when he fights with the parents; when he moves away from them, against them, he attains his own individual ego. If he goes on clinging to his parents, following them, he will never be an individual in his own right. He has to go astray – this is how life is meant to be. He has to become independent, and there is pain in becoming independent. There is a fight; and you can fight only if you feel you are. And this is a circle: if you feel you are, you can fight more; if you fight more, you become more, you are more – you feel, “I am.” The child attains maturity when he becomes totally independent. Because of this independence he has to go astray.\nThe sinner may be seeking independence from the society, from the mother, from the father – but the sinner is seeking independence and ego in a wrong way. The saint is also seeking independence, but in a right way. The ways are different, but wrong ways are always easier. To become a saint is difficult, because to become a saint you must have been a sinner first. Try to understand this: to be a sinner you need not be a saint first, but to be a saint you need to be a sinner first. Otherwise, your saintliness will be poor, it will not be rich; it will be flat, pale, it will not be alive; it will be a summer stream, not a flooded river.\nONE OF THEM WENT ASTRAY, WHICH WAS THE LARGEST.\nAs far as I know, the word ‘largest’, in the world of sheep, carries the meaning of ‘the best’. Because the largest sheep is the best sheep – it carries more wool, it carries more fat, so it costs more to purchase – if you sell it you will gain more. The larger the sheep the better, the smaller the sheep the poorer. ‘Largest’ means the best – and the best went astray. It is symbolic.\nThe shepherd left behind the ninety-nine – they were not worthwhile.\nWhy does Jesus always choose the shepherd and the sheep? It is very meaningful, his symbology is meaningful: the whole crowd of mediocre minds is just like sheep, they live in a crowd. Look at sheep moving on the road: they move as if they have a collective mind, not like independent beings – hugging to each other, huddled, afraid to move alone. They move in a crowd.\nI have heard: one schoolteacher was asking a small boy whose father was a shepherd, “If there are ten sheep and one jumps over the fence around your house, how many will remain behind?”\nThe boy said, “None!” The teacher said, “What are you saying? I am giving you an arithmetical problem to solve – what are you saying? Ten sheep were there, one has jumped out; how many are left behind?”\nThe boy said, “You may know arithmetic, but I know sheep – none!” ... Because sheep have a collective mind, they move as a crowd: if one jumps, they will all jump.\nThe shepherd left the ninety-nine sheep behind and went in search of the one sheep who had gone astray.\nJesus always says that God will go in search of the sinner, not in search of the mediocre, the middle class – because the mediocre one is not worthwhile, he has not earned that much worth. And, moreover, he is always on the path, so there is no need to seek him, no need to search for him – and he cannot go astray. That’s why the shepherd left ninety-nine sheep in the forest, in the dark night, and went in search of the one who had gone astray: because this one had become individual, this one had attained the ego; the other ninety-nine were without egos, they were a crowd.\nLook at your whole being: is it still a crowd, or have you become an ego? If you have become an ego, then God will be in search of you because it is worthwhile – you have to be sought, you have to be found. You have gained half the circle, and now the other half is surrender; now the other half can be attained through God. Only you can do the first half, the other half will be completed by the divine. When you have an ego, then somewhere, in some form, God is in search of you because you have done your part, you have become an individual. Now, if you lose individuality you will become universal.\nThis is the difference: before individuality you are just a crowd – not universal, just a crowd, the local crowd. Then you attain individuality, you go astray; you become independent, you become an ego – and then when you lose this ego you become the ocean, you become the whole.\nRight now you are not, so you cannot become the whole. Right now the crowd exists, you are just numbers in the crowd. They do it well in the military, they give numbers to the soldiers: one, two, three, four – no names, because really you don’t have any name, you have not earned it. You are just a number, a digit: one, two, three, four... so when somebody dies, they can write on the board that such and such numbers have fallen. They are numbers and numbers can be replaced. When ‘number one’ has fallen he can be replaced by another person, and he becomes ‘number one’. In the military there are sheep, and the military is the perfect society, the perfect antlike society, the crowd. If you want to know the crowd mind look at the military: they have to discipline you completely, in such a way that you lose all independence. An order is an order, you are not to think about it. They order, “Right turn!” and you right turn! And this becomes so deep.\nI have heard that the wife of one colonel was very much disturbed, because whenever the colonel slept on his left side he would snore. And it was difficult for her because it was not an ordinary snore – a colonel’s snore. It was like a roar, so it was impossible for her to sleep. But whenever he lay on his right side, then he would not snore. So she went to a psychoanalyst and asked about it. He said, “It is simple: whenever he snores, turn him to the right.”\nShe said, “That’s difficult! He’s a heavy man and then he gets angry. If I shake him and wake him up he gets angry; and it happens so many times in the night that my whole night would be lost doing this.”\nThe psychoanalyst said, “Don’t worry – simply whisper in the colonel’s ear, ‘Right turn!’ and it will do.” And it did! An order is an order – it goes so deep in the unconscious.\nA society exists as a crowd. You can turn it into an army immediately, with no trouble. That’s why Hitler could succeed in turning his whole country into an army camp. Mao has succeeded in turning his whole country into an army camp. The society lives just on the boundary, you can switch it immediately: a little discipline and the society can be turned into a military camp. There is no individuality because individuality is not allowed, you should not assert yourself. This is the sheeplike crowd, the sheeplike mind.\nHave you got any consciousness of your own? Or do you simply live as a part of the society you were born in? You are a Hindu, a Mohammedan, a Christian, a Sikh, a Jaina – but are you a man? You cannot say that you are a man, because a man has no society. A Socrates is a man, a Jesus is a man, a Nanak is a man – but not you! You belong, but a man belongs to no one, he stands on his own feet. That is what Jesus says: The best goes astray. And once the best goes astray, the shepherd... left behind the ninety-nine, and he sought for the one until he found it.\nYou go on praying for God but he is not in search of you, that’s why you miss him. First become yourself, then he will be in search of you. There is no need to seek God – and how can you seek him? You don’t know the address, you don’t know his abode. You only know meaningless words and theories; they will not help.\nI have heard that one priest arrived in a new town. The taxis were on strike and he had to reach the church, because he had to deliver the sermon that evening. So he asked a small boy where the church was and the boy led him there. When he reached the church he thanked the boy and said to him, “I am very grateful that you helped me – not only did you show me, you came with me. If you are at all interested in knowing where God is, come this evening to my sermon, my talk. I am going to talk about the way to the abode of the divine.”\nThe boy laughed and he said, “You don’t know the way to the church; how will you know the way to the divine? I’m not coming!”\nBut I tell you, even if you know the way to the church it makes no difference. Everybody knows the way to the church, but that makes no difference because the church is not his abode, it has never been! You cannot seek him because you don’t know him. He can seek you because he knows you – and this is one of the basic teachings of Jesus: that man cannot reach the divine, but the divine can reach man. And he always reaches whenever you are ready.\nSo the question is not to seek him, the question is just to be ready and wait. And the first readiness is to become individual, ‘to go astray’. The first thing is to be rebellious, because only then do you gain the ego. The first thing is to go beyond the crowd – that is what going astray means: to go beyond the clearcut, formulated, limited scope of the society, because beyond it is the wilderness, beyond it exists the vastness of God.\nThe society is just a clearing in the forest. It is not real, it is man-created. All your laws are man- created; whatsoever you call virtue, whatsoever you call sin, is just man-created. You don’t really know what virtue is. This word ‘virtue’ from the Latin origin is very beautiful: the word from the Latin means ‘powerful’; it doesn’t mean ‘good’, it means ‘virile’, it means ‘powerful’.\nBe powerful, assert yourself, stand on your own. Don’t fall a victim to the crowd. Start thinking, start being yourself. And follow your lonely path – don’t be a sheep!\nNinety-nine sheep can be left in the forest – there is no fear about them. They will not be lost because they will huddle together, so they can be found any moment. The problem is not with them but with the one, the best, who has left the fold. Whenever a sheep can leave the fold it means power exists there, and the sheep is not afraid of the forest, not afraid of the wild animals, not afraid at all; the sheep has become fearless – only then can she leave the fold. And fearlessness is the first step of being ready.\nEgo is the first step to surrender. It looks absolutely paradoxical. You will think that I am mad, because you think that humbleness is needed. I say, no! – first ego is needed, otherwise your humbleness will be false. First ego is needed – sharp, sharp like a sword. That will give you a clarity of being, a distinctness, and then you can drop it; when you have it you can drop it. Then a humbleness comes and that humbleness is totally different: it is not the humbleness of the poor, it is not the humbleness of the weak – it is the humbleness of the strong, it is the humbleness of the powerful. Then you can yield, but not before that.\nHE LEFT BEHIND THE NINETY-NINE, HE SOUGHT FOR THE ONE UNTIL HE FOUND IT.\nAnd remember you need not go to seek God, he will come to you. Just become worthy and he will find you, he has to make a path towards you. The moment someone somewhere becomes crystallized, the whole divine energy moves towards him. He may reach you as an enlightened man, he may reach you as a master, as a guru – in millions of ways he can reach you. But how he reaches you is not the point – that is for him to worry about, it is not for you to worry about. First attain the ego, be ready, become individual, and then the universal can happen to you.\nHAVING TIRED HIMSELF OUT, HE SAID TO THE SHEEP: I LOVE YOU MORE.\nThe one who has become rebellious, God loves him more. Priests will say, “What nonsense! One who has gone astray, God loves him more?” The priests cannot believe it, but this is how it happens. Jesus is the lost sheep, Buddha is the lost sheep, Mahavira is the lost sheep. The crowd goes on moving in its mediocrity, while a Mahavira, a Buddha and a Jesus are sought out – God rushes towards them.\nThis happened under the bodhi tree where Buddha was sitting, perfectly individual, with all the chains of society, culture, religion broken – all the chains broken, perfectly alone. Then God rushed from everywhere, from all directions – because he is in all directions – and Buddha became a god. And he had denied that there is a God, because that was one of the ways to go astray. He had said, “There is no God, I don’t believe in any God.” He had said that there is no society, no religion. He denied the Vedas, he denied the caste system – brahmins, sudras. He denied the whole Hindu structure of thinking. He said, “I am not a Hindu, and I don’t belong to any society, and I don’t believe in any theories. Unless I know the truth I am not going to believe in anything!”\nHe went on denying. A moment came when he was alone and there was no link with anything, absolutely broken. He became an island, absolutely alone. Under that bodhi tree, twenty-five centuries ago, God rushed from everywhere to this man, to this sheep who had gone astray, and told Buddha.Having tired himself out, he said to the sheep: I love thee more than the ninety-nine.\nThis was also said to Jesus, this has always been so, this is the foundational law. God seeks the man, not the man God – man just has to be ready.\nAnd how to be ready? Become individual, be a revolutionary. Go beyond the society, be fearless, break all chains, all relationships. Be alone and exist as if you are the center of the world. Then God rushes towards you, and in his rush your ego is lost, the island disappears into the ocean – suddenly you are no more.\nFirst the society has to be dropped – and that is the inner mechanics – because your ego can exist only with the society. If you go on dropping the society, there will come a moment when the ego will be alone because the society has been dropped. But then without the society the ego cannot exist, because society helps you to exist as an ego. If you go on dropping the society, by and by the base is dropped. When there is no ‘thou’ the ‘I’ cannot exist. At the final stage ‘I’ disappears because ‘thou’ has been dropped. When there is no ‘you’, ‘I’ am not. The ‘you’ has to be dropped, then the ‘I’ drops. But by dropping ‘you’ first, the ‘I’ becomes sharper, crystallized, centered, beautiful, powerful. Then it is consumed – this is the rush of the divine.\nJesus was crucified because of these sayings. He was making people rebellious, he was teaching them to go astray. He was saying that God loves the one who has gone astray – the sinner, the rebel, the egoist. The Jews could not tolerate it, it was too much. This man had to be silenced: “This man has to be stopped – he is going too far, he will destroy the whole society!” He was creating a situation in which the priests would not be able to stand, the church would dissolve.\nHe was against the crowd – and the crowd is all that is around you – and the crowd became panic- stricken. They thought, “This man is the enemy, he is destroying the very base. Without the crowd how can we live?” By going and teaching the ninety-nine sheep to go astray, they will huddle together more. And if you go on teaching them they will take revenge, they will kill you, they will say, “Enough is enough!”\nWe live in the crowd, we are part of the crowd. Alone we cannot exist. We don’t know how to be alone, we always exist with the other. The other is needed, it is a must. Without the other who are you? Your identity is lost.\nThis is the problem: ninety-nine sheep create all religions, and the real religion happens only to the one sheep who has gone astray.\nBe courageous! Move beyond the clearing, go to the wild. Life is there, and only then will you grow. There may be suffering, because there is no growth without suffering. There may be a cross, crucifixion, because without it there is no maturity. Society may take revenge through crucifixion – accept it. That is bound to happen, because when the one sheep comes back the ninety-nine will say, “This is the sinner! This sheep went astray, this one is no part of us, this sheep doesn’t belong to us!”\nAnd those ninety-nine sheep will be absolutely unable to conceive that the shepherd is carrying that sheep on his shoulders – because this is the lost sheep and it has been found.\nJesus says the shepherd will go back to his home, he will call his friends, and he will have a feast because a sheep was lost and a sheep has been found. Jesus says whenever a sinner enters into heaven there is rejoicing, because a sheep has been lost and a sheep has been found.\nEnough for today.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9463","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_mustard_seed_my_most_loved_gospel_on_jesus/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_mustard_seed_my_most_loved_gospel_on_jesus/>The Mustard Seed.

ONE OF THEM WENT ASTRAY WHICH WAS THE LARGEST.</p><p>HE LEFT BEHIND THE NINETY-NINE, HE SOUGHT FOR THE ONE UNTIL HE FOUND
IT.</p><p><br></p><p>HAVING TIRED HIMSELF OUT, HE SAID TO THE SHEEP: I LOVE THEE MORE THAN
THE NINETY-NINE.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the most puzzling problems has been: what will happen to the
sinners, those who have gone astray? What is the relationship between
the divine and the sinner? Is the sinner going to be punished? Is there
going to be a hell? ... Because all the priests have been insisting that
the sinner is going to be thrown into hell, he is to be punished. But
can God punish anybody? Is there not compassion enough? And if God
cannot forgive, then who will be able to forgive?</p><p><br></p><p>Many answers have been given, but Jesus’ answer is the most
beautiful. Before we enter into this saying many other things have to be
understood; they will give you the background.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever we punish a person, whatsoever rationalizations we may like
to make, our reasons are different; and remember the distinction between
reason and rationalization. You may be a father or a mother, and your
child has done something of which you don’t approve. It doesn’t matter
whether he has done something right or wrong, because who knows what is
right and what is wrong? But</p><p>you disapprove and whatsoever you disapprove of becomes wrong. It may
be, it may not be, that is not the point – whatsoever you approve of is
right. So it depends on your approval and disapproval.</p><p><br></p><p>And when a child goes astray, is doing something wrong in your view,
you punish him. The deep reason is that he has disobeyed, not that he
has done something wrong; the deep reason is that your ego feels hurt.
The child has been in conflict with you, he has asserted himself. He has
said no to you, the father, the authority, the powerful one, so you
punish the child. The reason is that your ego is hurt and punishment is
a sort of revenge.</p><p><br></p><p>But the rationalization is different: you say that it is because he
has done wrong and he has to be put right – unless he is punished how is
he going to be put right? So he should be punished when he moves in a
wrong way, and he should be rewarded when he follows you. That’s how he
is to be conditioned for a right life. This is the rationalization, this
is how you talk about it in your mind, but this is not the basic
unconscious reason.</p><p><br></p><p>The unconscious reason is totally different: it is to put the child
in his place, to remind him that you are the boss and he is not the
boss, that you will decide what is wrong and what is right, that it is
you who are going to give him direction; that he is not free, that you
possess him, that you are the owner – and if he disobeys then he will
suffer.</p><p><br></p><p>If you ask the Depth Psychologists they will say that in all behavior
this distinction between reason and the rationalization has to be
understood well. Rationalization is a very cunning device – it hides the
real reason and gives a false thing to you, but looks absolutely okay on
the surface. And this is happening not only between a father and a
child, a mother and a child, it is also happening between society and
those children who have gone astray. That’s why prison exists, the law
exists – it is a revenge, a revenge taken by society.</p><p><br></p><p>Society cannot tolerate somebody who is rebellious, because he will
destroy the whole structure. He may be right: Athens could not tolerate
Socrates, not because he was wrong – he was absolutely right – but
Athens could not tolerate him because if he had been tolerated then the
whole structure of the society would have gone, been thrown to the dogs;
then the society could not have existed. So Socrates had to be
sacrificed to society.</p><p><br></p><p>And Jesus was crucified, not because whatsoever he was saying was
wrong – never have such true words been asserted on this earth – but he
was sacrificed to the society because the way he was talking, the way he
was behaving, was dangerous to the structure.</p><p><br></p><p>Society cannot tolerate this so it will punish you. But it also
rationalizes: it says this is just to put you right, it punishes you for
your own good. And nobody ever bothers whether that good is ever
achieved or not. We have been punishing criminals for thousands of
years, but nobody bothers whether those criminals are ever transformed
through our punishment or not. Criminals go on increasing: as prisons
increase, prisoners increase; the more laws, the more criminals; the
more courts, the more punishments. The result is absolutely absurd –
more criminality.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the problem? The criminal can also feel that it is a
rationalization, that he is punished for doing wrong – really he is
punished because he has been caught. So he also has his rationalization:
next time he has to be more cunning and more clever, that’s all. This
time he has been caught</p><p>because he was not alert, not because he has done wrong. Society
proved more clever than him, so next time he will see – he is going to
prove himself more cunning, clever, intelligent, and then he will not be
caught. A prisoner, a criminal who is punished always thinks that he is
punished, not for the thing he has committed, but because he has been
caught. So the only thing he is going to learn from the punishment is
not to be caught again.</p><p><br></p><p>So whenever a prisoner comes out of prison he is a better criminal
than ever: he has lived with experienced people inside the prison, with
more advanced adepts who know much, who have been punished much and who
have suffered long – who have been caught – and who have been deceiving
in many, many ways; who are very advanced on the path of crime. Living
with them, serving them, becoming a disciple to them, he learns; he
learns through experience that next time he is not to be caught. Then he
is a better criminal.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody is stopped by punishment, but society goes on thinking that it
is because the wrong has to be stopped that we punish. Both are wrong:
society has some other reason – it takes revenge. And the criminal, he
also understands – because egos understand each other’s language very
easily, howsoever unconscious – the criminal also thinks, “Okay, I will
take revenge when my time comes, I will see.” Then a conflict exists
between the criminal’s ego and society’s ego.</p><p><br></p><p>Is God the same? – just like a justice, a magistrate, just like a
father or a boss? Is God also cruel in the same way as society is? Is
God also the same deep down, an egoist as we are? Will he take revenge
if you disobey? Will he punish you? Then he is no longer divine, then he
is just an ordinary man like us.</p><p><br></p><p>This is one of the profoundest problems: how will God behave with a
sinner who has gone astray? Will he be kind? Then there are other things
implied. And if he wants to be just, he cannot have compassion, because
justice and compassion cannot exist together. Compassion means
unconditional forgiveness, but it is not just, because it is
possible<span class=s4></span>A saint prayed continuously his</p><p>whole life, never did anything wrong; was always afraid of moving
beyond the boundary, lived in his own confinement, created an
imprisonment for himself; never did anything wrong, remained virtuous
his whole life; never allowed himself any enjoyment of the senses, was
very austere. And then there was another man who lived, indulged, did
whatsoever came to his mind; went wherever his senses led him, enjoyed
whatsoever the world gave; did all types of things, all types of sins –
and then both reached the divine, both reached God’s world.</p><p><br></p><p>What will happen? If the saint is not rewarded and the sinner is not
punished, it will be very unjust. If both are rewarded, that too will be
unjust, because the saint will think: “I have lived a good life, but
nothing special is given to me for it.” If the sinner is also rewarded
in the same way, then what is the use of being a saint? The whole thing
becomes futile. Then God may be compassionate, but he is not just.</p><p><br></p><p>If he is just, then the arithmetic will be clear in our minds: the
sinner has to be punished, the saint has to be rewarded. But then he
cannot have compassion – a just man has to be cruel because otherwise
justice cannot be done. A just man has to live in the head, not in the
heart.</p><p><br></p><p>A magistrate should not have a heart, otherwise his justice will
waver. He should not have any kindness in him, because kindness will
become a barrier to doing justice. A man who is just must</p><p>become like a computer, just a head: laws, rewards, punishments – no
heart enters into it, no feeling should be allowed. He should remain a
spectator, unfeeling, as if there is no heart in him. But then a
difficult problem arises, because for centuries we have been saying that
God is both just and compassionate; kind, loving, and yet just. Then it
is a contradiction, a paradox – how to solve it?</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus has one answer, and the most beautiful. Now try to understand
his answer. It will be difficult because it will go against all your
preconceptions, against all your prejudices, because Jesus is not a
believer in punishment. Nobody like Jesus can be a believer in
punishment, because deep down punishment is revenge. A Buddha, a
Krishna, a Jesus, they cannot believe in punishment. Rather, on the
contrary, they can drop the very quality of justice from God. But
compassion cannot be dropped, because justice is a human ideal,
compassion is divine. Justice has conditions attached to it: “Do this
and you will achieve this. Don’t do that, otherwise you will miss this.”
Compassion has no conditions.</p><p><br></p><p>God is compassionate. And to understand his compassion we have to
start from the sinner.</p><p><br></p><p>JESUS SAID: THE KINGDOM IS LIKE A SHEPHERD WHO HAD ONE HUNDRED SHEEP.
ONE OF THEM WENT ASTRAY, WHICH WAS THE LARGEST. HE LEFT BEHIND THE
NINETY-NINE, HE SOUGHT FOR THE ONE UNTIL HE FOUND IT. HAVING TIRED
HIMSELF OUT, HE SAID TO THE SHEEP: I LOVE THEE MORE THAN THE
NINETY-NINE.</p><p><br></p><p>Absurd, illogical – but true. Try to understand: THE KINGDOM OF GOD
IS LIKE A SHEPHERD WHO HAD ONE HUNDRED SHEEP. ONE OF THEM WENT ASTRAY,
WHICH WAS THE</p><p>LARGEST. It is always so – the one who goes astray is always the
best. If you are a father and you have five children, only the best
child will try to resist and deny you, only the best child will assert
himself. The mediocre ones will always yield to you, but the one who is
not mediocre will rebel, because the very quality of his mind is
rebellious. Intelligence is rebellious: the more intelligent, the more
rebellious. And those who are not rebellious, who are yea-sayers, are
almost dead; you may like them, but they have no life in them. They
follow you not because they love you, they follow you because they are
weak, they are afraid, they cannot stand alone, they cannot stand
against – they are weaklings, impotent.</p><p><br></p><p>Look around: people whom you think are good are almost always those
who are weak. Their goodness does not come out of their strength, it
comes out of their weakness. They are good because they cannot dare to
be bad. But what type of goodness is this which comes out of weakness?
Goodness must come out of overflowing strength, only then is it good,
because then it has life, a floodlike life.</p><p><br></p><p>So whenever a sinner becomes a saint, the saintliness has its own
glory. But whenever an ordinary man becomes a saint because of his
weakness, the saintliness is pale and dead, there is no life in it. You
can become a saint out of weakness – but remember, then you will miss.
Only if you become a saint out of your strength will you reach. A man
who is good because he cannot be bad is not really good. The moment he
becomes stronger he will become bad; give him power and power will
corrupt him immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>This happened in this country: Gandhi had a great following, but it
seems that the goodness of his followers came out of weakness. They were
good when they were not in power, but when they came to power, when they
became the rulers of this country, then the power corrupted them
immediately.</p><p>Can power corrupt a powerful man? Never, because he is already
powerful. If power could corrupt him, power would have corrupted him
already! Power corrupts only if you are weak and your goodness comes out
of weakness. Lord Acton has said, “Power corrupts and corrupts
absolutely!” But I would like to make it conditional; this statement is
not unconditional, not categorical, it cannot be. Power corrupts if
goodness comes out of weakness; if goodness comes out of strength, no
power can corrupt. How can power corrupt if you know it already, when it
is there already? But it is very difficult to find from where your
goodness comes. If you are not a thief because you are afraid of being
caught, the day you become certain that now nobody can catch you, you
will become a thief – because then who will prevent you? Only your fear
was preventing you; you were not going to murder your enemy because you
knew you would be caught. But if a situation arises where you can murder
the man and you cannot be caught, you cannot be punished for it, you
will murder him immediately. So it is only through weakness that you are
good.</p><p>But how can goodness arise out of weakness? Goodness needs
overflowing energy. Goodness is a luxury, remember, saintliness is a
luxury – it comes out of affluence. When there is too much energy, so
much that you are flooded with it, then you start sharing it. Then you
cannot exploit because there is no need. Then you can give out of your
heart because you have so much that really you are burdened. You would
like to share and renounce, you would like to throw everything and give
all your life as a gift.</p><p>When you have something you would like to give it – remember this
law: you cling to something only when you don’t really own it; if you
own it you can give it. Only when you can give something happily are you
the owner. If you are still clinging to it, then deep down you are
afraid and you are not the master of it. You know deep down that it does
not belong to you, and sooner or later it will be taken away from you.
That is why you cannot give. So only when a person gives his love does
he show that he has love; only when a person gives his whole life does
he show that he is alive. There is no other way to know it.</p><p>Out of weakness much goodness appears. It is an appearance, it is a
false coin, and a false coin is just like a paper flower or a plastic
flower. Whenever a tree flowers it flowers only because it is flooded
with too much energy. Flowers are luxuries – a tree flowers only when it
can afford to. If water is not given in the right proportion, if
fertilizers are not given in the right proportion, if the soil is not
rich, then the tree may have leaves but it cannot have flowers.</p><p>There is a hierarchy: the highest can exist only when there is energy
to move to the highest. If you are not fed well, intelligence will
disappear first because that is a flowering. In a poor country the real
poverty is not of the body, the real poverty is of intelligence, because
if the country is very poor intelligence cannot exist – it is a
flowering. Only when all the bodily needs are fulfilled does energy move
higher; when the bodily needs are not fulfilled, the energy moves to
fulfill the bodily needs first, because the base has to be protected
first, the root has to be protected first. If there is no root there
cannot be any flowering; if there is no body then where will the
intelligence exist? And compassion is even higher than intelligence, and
meditation still higher.</p><p>In India, Buddha and Mahavira were produced when the country was very
rich. Since then so-called saints have existed, but not a man like
Buddha. Difficult, very difficult – because such a flowering is possible
only when there is useless energy, energy which cannot be used; only
then does the energy start enjoying itself. And when energy starts
enjoying itself it begins to turn inwards, it becomes an inner turning.
Then it becomes meditation, then a Buddha is born, then ecstasy
exists.</p><p>Don’t give water to the tree and first the flowers will disappear,
then the leaves will disappear; then the branches will die and only at
the last moment will the roots die – because with roots things can come
up again, so the tree will protect its roots. The root is the lowest,
but the lowest has to be protected because it is the foundation. When
good days come, when the rains come and there is water, then again the
root can sprout, again the leaves will come, and again there will be a
flowering. This same hierarchy exists in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Be good out of your energy, never be good out of your weakness. I am
not saying be bad... because out of weakness, how can you be either?
Badness needs energy as much as goodness. You cannot be bad, you cannot
be evil without energy, and you cannot be good without energy – because
both are real. Then what can you be without energy? You can just have a
false face: you will not be anything, you will just be a facade, a
deception, a ghost, not a real person – whatsoever you do will be
ghostlike. And this is what is happening. Then you will create a false
goodness, a false saintliness. You will think you are a saint because
you have not committed any sin, not because you have attained the
divine.</p><p>When you attain the divine it is an achievement, a positive energy
achievement. Then you become godlike, and then there is no effort to be
godlike – it flows spontaneously. You can resist being bad, but that is
negative. When you resist, the desire is there; and if the desire is
there to do evil, you have committed it – it makes no difference. That
is the difference between sin and crime.</p><p><br></p><p>Crime has to be an act. You can go on thinking about committing
crime, but no court can punish you because no court has authority over
the mind, only over the body – a crime has to be an act. I can go on
thinking of murdering the whole world, but no court can punish me just
because I go on thinking about it. I can say I enjoy it, but I have not
murdered anybody, it has not become an act. Action comes under the law,
not thought, and this is the difference between crime and sin.</p><p><br></p><p>Sin doesn’t make any distinction between your acts and your thoughts:
if you think, the seed is there; whether it sprouts in the act or not is
not the problem. If it becomes an act then it will be a crime. But if
you have thought it you have already committed the sin – for the divine
you have become a criminal, you have gone astray. But this is the point
to be understood, a very difficult one: that those who go astray are
always more powerful than those who remain on the path.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who go astray are always the best. Go to a madhouse and see:
you will find the most intelligent people have gone mad. Look at the
past seventy years of this century: the most intelligent people have
gone mad, not the mediocre ones. Nietzsche, one of the best
intelligences ever born, went mad, had to go mad – he had so much
energy; so much energy that it could not be confined, so much energy
that it had to become a flood; it could not be a gentle stream, he could
not channel it – it was like an ocean, wild. Nietzsche went mad,
Nijinsky went mad. Look at the seventy years of this century and you
will find the best, the cream, the very best went mad, and the
mediocrities were sane.</p><p>This looks very absurd: mediocrities are sane and genius goes mad.
Why does a mediocre person remain sane? No energy to move astray. A
child becomes a problem child when he has overflowing energy, he has to
do something or other. Only a bloodless child remains in the corner; if
you say to him, “Repeat Ram, Ram, Ram,” he will repeat it, if you give
him a rosary he will do it. But if the child is really alive then he
will throw away the rosary and he will say, “This is stupid! I’m going
to play and I’m going to climb in the trees, I’m going to do
something!”</p><p>Life is energy. Only a bloodless, anemic mind will not go astray,
cannot, because it is difficult to afford that much energy, it is
difficult to move to that extreme, to that abyss. But those who go
astray – if they are ever found – they become buddhas. If Nietzsche had
ever gone into meditation he would have become a buddha. He had the
energy to become mad, so he had the energy to become enlightened – it is
the same energy, only the direction changes. A potential buddha will
become mad if he is not going to become a buddha – where will the energy
go? If you cannot be creative, energy becomes destructive. Go to the
madhouses: you will find the most intelligent men there; they are mad
only because they are not mediocre; they are mad because they can see
further than you, deeper than you. And when they see deeper than you,
illusions disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole of life is such a puzzling thing that if you can see deeper
it will be very difficult to remain sane, very difficult. One remains
sane because one cannot see: you see only two percent of life, and
ninety-eight percent, psychologists say, has been closed, because if you
come to see it, it will be such a flood that you will not be able to
tolerate it – you will go insane, berserk.</p><p><br></p><p>Now a few psychologists, those who have been studying madness very
deeply, like R.D.Laing and others, are stumbling on certain facts. One
of the facts is this: that people who go mad are the best, people who go
into crime are the most rebellious. They can become great saints and it
is not a surprise if a Valmiki becomes a saint. Valmiki was a dacoit, a
murderer, he lived by murder and loot. A sudden happening – and he
became enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>One enlightened person was passing, and Valmiki, a murderer, a man
who lived by theft, caught hold of this enlightened man. The enlightened
man said, “What are you going to do?”</p><p><br></p><p>Valmiki said, “I am going to rob you of all that you have!”</p><p><br></p><p>The enlightened man said, “If you could do that I would be happy,
because I have something very inner – steal it, you are welcome!”</p><p><br></p><p>Valmiki could not understand it, but he said, “I am concerned only
with outward things.” The enlightened man said, “But they won’t help
much. And why are you doing this?”</p><p>Valmiki replied, “Because of my family, for my family – my mother, my
wife, my children – they will starve if I don’t do this; and I only know
this art.”</p><p><br></p><p>So the enlightened man said, “Bind me to a tree so I cannot escape,
and go back and tell your mother and your wife and your children that
you are committing sin for them. Ask them if they are ready to share the
punishment. When you are before God, when the last judgment comes, will
they be ready to share the punishment?”</p><p><br></p><p>For the first time Valmiki started thinking. He said, “You may be
right. I should go and ask.”</p><p><br></p><p>He went back, asked his wife, and she said, “Why should I share the
punishment? I have not done anything. If you do anything it’s your
responsibility.”</p><p><br></p><p>And his mother said, “Why should I share it? I am your mother, it is
your duty to feed me. I don’t know how you bring the bread, that’s your
responsibility.”</p><p>Nobody was ready to share the punishment – and Valmiki became
converted. He came back, fell at the feet of the enlightened man and
said, “Now give me the inner, I’m not interested in the outer. Now let
me be the robber of the inner, because I have understood that I am alone
and whatsoever I do, it is my responsibility, nobody is going to share
it. I am born alone, I will die alone, and whatsoever I do is my
individual personal responsibility; nobody is going to share it. So now
I must look inwards and find who I am. Finished! I am finished with this
whole business!” This man was converted in a second.</p><p><br></p><p>The same story happened with Buddha. There was one man who was almost
mad, a mad murderer. He had taken a vow that he would kill one thousand
people, not less than that, because the society had not treated him
well. He would take his revenge by killing one thousand people. And from
every person killed he would take one finger and make a rosary around
his neck – one thousand fingers. Because of this his name became
Angulimala: the man with a rosary of fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>He killed nine hundred and ninety-nine people. Nobody would move in
those parts; wherever people came to know that Angulimala was, the
traffic would stop. And then it became very difficult for him to find
one man, and only one more man was needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha was passing a forest; people came to him from the villages and
they said, “Don’t go! Angulimala is there, that mad murderer! He doesn’t
think twice, he simply murders; and he will not think that you are a
buddha. Don’t go that way; there is another way, you can move by that
one, but don’t go through this forest!”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “If I don’t go, then who will go? And he is waiting for
one more, so I have to go.”</p><p><br></p><p>Angulimala had almost completed his vow. And he was a man of energy
because he was fighting the whole society: only one man – and he had
killed a thousand people. And kings were afraid of him, generals were
afraid, and the government and the law and the police – nobody could do
anything. But Buddha said, “He is a man, he needs me. I must take the
risk. Either he will kill me or I will kill him.” This is what buddhas
do: they stake, they risk their lives. Buddha went. Even the closest
disciples who had said that they would remain with him up to the very
end, they started lagging behind – because this was dangerous!</p><p><br></p><p>So when Buddha reached the hill where Angulimala was sitting on a
rock, there was no one behind him, he was alone. All the disciples had
disappeared. Angulimala looked at this innocent man; childlike, so
beautiful, he thought, that even a murderer felt compassion for him. He
thought, “This man seems to be absolutely unaware that I am here,
otherwise nobody goes along this path.” And the man looked so innocent,
so beautiful, that even Angulimala thought, “It is not good to kill this
man. I’ll leave him, I can find somebody else.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then he said to Buddha, “Go back! Stop there now and go back! Don’t
move a step forward! I am Angulimala, and these are nine hundred and
ninety-nine fingers here, and I need one finger more – even if my mother
comes I will kill her and fulfill my vow! So don’t come near, I’m
dangerous! And I am not a believer in religion, I’m not bothered who you
are. You may be a very good monk, a great saint maybe, but I don’t care!
I only care about the finger, and your finger is as good as anybody
else’s so don’t come a single step further, otherwise I will kill you.
Stop!” But Buddha continued moving.</p><p>Then Angulimala thought, “Either this man is deaf or mad!” He again
shouted, “Stop! Don’t move!”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “I stopped long ago; I am not moving, Angulimala, you
are moving. I stopped long ago. All movement has stopped because all
motivation has stopped. When there is no motivation, how can movement
happen? There is no goal for me, I have achieved the goal so why should
I move? You are moving – and I say to you: you stop!”</p><p><br></p><p>Angulimala was sitting on the rock and he started laughing. He said,
“You are really mad! I am sitting and you say to me that I am moving,
and you are moving and you say that you have stopped. You are really a
fool or mad – or I don’t know what type, what manner of man you
are!”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha came near and he said, “I have heard that you need one more
finger. As far as this body is concerned, my goal is achieved, this body
is useless. When I die people will burn it, it will be of no use to
anyone. You can use it, your vow can be fulfilled: cut off my finger and
cut off my head. I have come on purpose because this is the last chance
for my body to be used in some way; otherwise people will burn it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Angulimala said, “What are you saying? I thought that I was the only
madman around here. And don’t try to be clever because I am dangerous, I
can still kill you!”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “Before you kill me, do one thing, just the wish of a
dying man: cut off a branch of this tree.” Angulimala hit his sword
against the tree and a big branch fell down. Buddha said, “Just one
thing more: join it again to the tree!”</p><p><br></p><p>Angulimala said, “Now I know perfectly that you are mad – I can cut
but I cannot join.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then Buddha started laughing and he said, “When you can only destroy
and cannot create, you should not destroy because destruction can be
done by children, there is no bravery in it. This branch can be cut by a
child, but to join it a master is needed. And if you cannot even join
back a branch to the tree, how can you cut off human heads? Have you
ever thought about it?”</p><p><br></p><p>Angulimala closed his eyes, fell down at Buddha’s feet, and he said,
“You lead me on that path!” And it is said that in a single moment he
became enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>Next day he was a bhikkhu, a beggar, Buddha’s beggar, and begging in
the city. The whole city was closed. People were so afraid, they said,
“Even if he has become a beggar he cannot be believed. That man is so
dangerous!” People were not out on the roads. When Angulimala came to
beg nobody was there to give him food, because who would take the risk?
People were standing on their terraces looking down. And then they
started throwing stones at him because he had killed nine hundred and
ninety-nine men of that town. Almost every family had been a victim, so
they started throwing stones.</p><p><br></p><p>Angulimala fell down on the street, blood was flowing from all over
his body, he had many wounds. And Buddha came with his disciples and he
said, “Look! Angulimala, how are you feeling?”</p><p><br></p><p>Angulimala opened his eyes and said, “I am so grateful to you. They
can kill the body but they cannot touch me, and that is what I was doing
my whole life and never realized the fact.”</p><p>Buddha said, “Angulimala has become enlightened, he has become a
brahmin, a knower of Brahma.”</p><p><br></p><p>It can happen in a single moment if the energy is there. If the
energy is not there, then it is difficult. The whole system of yoga is
how to create energy, more energy. The whole dynamics of tantra is how
to create more energy in you, so you become a floodlike phenomenon. Then
you can become good or bad.</p><p><br></p><p>JESUS SAYS: ONE OF THEM WENT ASTRAY, WHICH WAS THE LARGEST.</p><p><br></p><p>Only those who are great, who are the best, go astray. The sinners
are the most beautiful people in the world – gone wrong, of course. They
can become saints any moment. Saints are beautiful, sinners are
beautiful, but the people who are just in between, they are ugly...
because impotence is the only ugliness: when you don’t have any energy,
when you are already a dead thing, a corpse, somehow carrying yourself,
or having others carry you.</p><p><br></p><p>Why do the best, why do the great go astray? There is a secret to be
understood: the process of growth is that first you have to attain the
ego. If you don’t attain to a crystallized ego surrender is never
possible. Looks paradoxical, but this is how it is. First, you have to
attain a very crystallized ego, and then you have to drop it. If you
don’t attain to a crystallized ego, surrender can never happen to you.
How can you surrender something which you have not got?</p><p><br></p><p>A rich man can renounce his riches, but what should a beggar do? He
has no riches to renounce. A great scholar can throw his intellect, but
what will a mediocre person do? How can he throw it when he has not got
it? If you have knowledge you can renounce it and become ignorant,
humble; but if you don’t have any knowledge, how can you renounce
it?</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates could say, “I don’t know anything.” This is the second part:
he knew much, then he realized that all knowledge is useless. But this
cannot be attained by a person who has not moved like Socrates. The
intellect has to be trained, knowledge has to be gained, the ego has to
be crystallized; this is the first part of life. When you have the
riches, then you can renounce them – the difference is great.</p><p><br></p><p>A beggar on the street and Buddha on the street are both beggars, but
the quality differs absolutely: Buddha is a beggar by his own will. He
is not forced to be a beggar, it is his freedom. Buddha is a beggar
because he has tasted riches and found them futile; Buddha is a beggar
because he has lived through desire and found it futile, useless. Buddha
is a beggar because the kingdom of this world has failed. So Buddha’s
beggary has a richness about it – no king can be so rich, because he is
still half way round and Buddha has completed the circle.</p><p><br></p><p>But a beggar who has never been rich also standing on the road... his
begging is simply begging, because he does not know the taste of riches.
How can he renounce a desire which he has not fulfilled? How can he say
that palaces are useless? He has no experience of them. How can he say
that beautiful women are worthless? He cannot say that because he has
not known beautiful women. Only experience can give you the key to
renounce. Without experience you can console yourself, and many poor
people, poor in many ways, do that.</p><p>If you don’t have a beautiful wife you go on saying, “What is there?
The body is just the body, and the body is mortal and it is the abode of
death.” But deep down, deep down the desire remains, and desire can go
only when experience has happened, when you have come to know – this is
a consolation. A poor man can console himself that there is nothing in
palaces, but he knows there is; otherwise, why is everybody mad for
riches? And he himself is obsessed and mad: in his dreams he lives in
palaces, in his dreams he becomes the emperor. But in the daytime, when
he is a beggar on the street, he goes on saying, “I don’t bother, I
don’t care, I have renounced!” This consolation is of no use; it is
dangerous, it is false.</p><p>The first part of life for a rightly maturing person is to attain the
ego; and the second part, then the circle becomes complete, is to
renounce it.</p><p>A child grows only when he resists his parents, when he fights with
the parents; when he moves away from them, against them, he attains his
own individual ego. If he goes on clinging to his parents, following
them, he will never be an individual in his own right. He has to go
astray – this is how life is meant to be. He has to become independent,
and there is pain in becoming independent. There is a fight; and you can
fight only if you feel you are. And this is a circle: if you feel you
are, you can fight more; if you fight more, you become more, you are
more – you feel, “I am.” The child attains maturity when he becomes
totally independent. Because of this independence he has to go
astray.</p><p>The sinner may be seeking independence from the society, from the
mother, from the father – but the sinner is seeking independence and ego
in a wrong way. The saint is also seeking independence, but in a right
way. The ways are different, but wrong ways are always easier. To become
a saint is difficult, because to become a saint you must have been a
sinner first. Try to understand this: to be a sinner you need not be a
saint first, but to be a saint you need to be a sinner first. Otherwise,
your saintliness will be poor, it will not be rich; it will be flat,
pale, it will not be alive; it will be a summer stream, not a flooded
river.</p><p>ONE OF THEM WENT ASTRAY, WHICH WAS THE LARGEST.</p><p><br></p><p>As far as I know, the word ‘largest’, in the world of sheep, carries
the meaning of ‘the best’. Because the largest sheep is the best sheep –
it carries more wool, it carries more fat, so it costs more to purchase
– if you sell it you will gain more. The larger the sheep the better,
the smaller the sheep the poorer. ‘Largest’ means the best – and the
best went astray. It is symbolic.</p><p>The shepherd left behind the ninety-nine – they were not
worthwhile.</p><p><br></p><p>Why does Jesus always choose the shepherd and the sheep? It is very
meaningful, his symbology is meaningful: the whole crowd of mediocre
minds is just like sheep, they live in a crowd. Look at sheep moving on
the road: they move as if they have a collective mind, not like
independent beings – hugging to each other, huddled, afraid to move
alone. They move in a crowd.</p><p>I have heard: one schoolteacher was asking a small boy whose father
was a shepherd, “If there are ten sheep and one jumps over the fence
around your house, how many will remain behind?”</p><p>The boy said, “None!” The teacher said, “What are you saying? I am
giving you an arithmetical problem to solve – what are you saying? Ten
sheep were there, one has jumped out; how many are left behind?”</p><p>The boy said, “You may know arithmetic, but I know sheep – none!” ...
Because sheep have a collective mind, they move as a crowd: if one
jumps, they will all jump.</p><p><br></p><p>The shepherd left the ninety-nine sheep behind and went in search of
the one sheep who had gone astray.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus always says that God will go in search of the sinner, not in
search of the mediocre, the middle class – because the mediocre one is
not worthwhile, he has not earned that much worth. And, moreover, he is
always on the path, so there is no need to seek him, no need to search
for him – and he cannot go astray. That’s why the shepherd left
ninety-nine sheep in the forest, in the dark night, and went in search
of the one who had gone astray: because this one had become individual,
this one had attained the ego; the other ninety-nine were without egos,
they were a crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at your whole being: is it still a crowd, or have you become an
ego? If you have become an ego, then God will be in search of you
because it is worthwhile – you have to be sought, you have to be found.
You have gained half the circle, and now the other half is surrender;
now the other half can be attained through God. Only you can do the
first half, the other half will be completed by the divine. When you
have an ego, then somewhere, in some form, God is in search of you
because you have done your part, you have become an individual. Now, if
you lose individuality you will become universal.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the difference: before individuality you are just a crowd –
not universal, just a crowd, the local crowd. Then you attain
individuality, you go astray; you become independent, you become an ego
– and then when you lose this ego you become the ocean, you become the
whole.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now you are not, so you cannot become the whole. Right now the
crowd exists, you are just numbers in the crowd. They do it well in the
military, they give numbers to the soldiers: one, two, three, four – no
names, because really you don’t have any name, you have not earned it.
You are just a number, a digit: one, two, three, four... so when
somebody dies, they can write on the board that such and such numbers
have fallen. They are numbers and numbers can be replaced. When ‘number
one’ has fallen he can be replaced by another person, and he becomes
‘number one’. In the military there are sheep, and the military is the
perfect society, the perfect antlike society, the crowd. If you want to
know the crowd mind look at the military: they have to discipline you
completely, in such a way that you lose all independence. An order is an
order, you are not to think about it. They order, “Right turn!” and you
right turn! And this becomes so deep.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that the wife of one colonel was very much disturbed,
because whenever the colonel slept on his left side he would snore. And
it was difficult for her because it was not an ordinary snore – a
colonel’s snore. It was like a roar, so it was impossible for her to
sleep. But whenever he lay on his right side, then he would not snore.
So she went to a psychoanalyst and asked about it. He said, “It is
simple: whenever he snores, turn him to the right.”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “That’s difficult! He’s a heavy man and then he gets angry.
If I shake him and wake him up he gets angry; and it happens so many
times in the night that my whole night would be lost doing this.”</p><p><br></p><p>The psychoanalyst said, “Don’t worry – simply whisper in the
colonel’s ear, ‘Right turn!’ and it will do.” And it did! An order is an
order – it goes so deep in the unconscious.</p><p>A society exists as a crowd. You can turn it into an army
immediately, with no trouble. That’s why Hitler could succeed in turning
his whole country into an army camp. Mao has succeeded in turning his
whole country into an army camp. The society lives just on the boundary,
you can switch it immediately: a little discipline and the society can
be turned into a military camp. There is no individuality because
individuality is not allowed, you should not assert yourself. This is
the sheeplike crowd, the sheeplike mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you got any consciousness of your own? Or do you simply live as
a part of the society you were born in? You are a Hindu, a Mohammedan, a
Christian, a Sikh, a Jaina – but are you a man? You cannot say that you
are a man, because a man has no society. A Socrates is a man, a Jesus is
a man, a Nanak is a man – but not you! You belong, but a man belongs to
no one, he stands on his own feet. That is what Jesus says: The best
goes astray. And once the best goes astray, the shepherd... left behind
the ninety-nine, and he sought for the one until he found it.</p><p><br></p><p>You go on praying for God but he is not in search of you, that’s why
you miss him. First become yourself, then he will be in search of you.
There is no need to seek God – and how can you seek him? You don’t know
the address, you don’t know his abode. You only know meaningless words
and theories; they will not help.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that one priest arrived in a new town. The taxis were on
strike and he had to reach the church, because he had to deliver the
sermon that evening. So he asked a small boy where the church was and
the boy led him there. When he reached the church he thanked the boy and
said to him, “I am very grateful that you helped me – not only did you
show me, you came with me. If you are at all interested in knowing where
God is, come this evening to my sermon, my talk. I am going to talk
about the way to the abode of the divine.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy laughed and he said, “You don’t know the way to the church;
how will you know the way to the divine? I’m not coming!”</p><p><br></p><p>But I tell you, even if you know the way to the church it makes no
difference. Everybody knows the way to the church, but that makes no
difference because the church is not his abode, it has never been! You
cannot seek him because you don’t know him. He can seek you because he
knows you – and this is one of the basic teachings of Jesus: that man
cannot reach the divine, but the divine can reach man. And he always
reaches whenever you are ready.</p><p><br></p><p>So the question is not to seek him, the question is just to be ready
and wait. And the first readiness is to become individual, ‘to go
astray’. The first thing is to be rebellious, because only then do you
gain the ego. The first thing is to go beyond the crowd – that is what
going astray means: to go beyond the clearcut, formulated, limited scope
of the society, because beyond it is the wilderness, beyond it exists
the vastness of God.</p><p><br></p><p>The society is just a clearing in the forest. It is not real, it is
man-created. All your laws are man- created; whatsoever you call virtue,
whatsoever you call sin, is just man-created. You don’t really know what
virtue is. This word ‘virtue’ from the Latin origin is very beautiful:
the word from the Latin means ‘powerful’; it doesn’t mean ‘good’, it
means ‘virile’, it means ‘powerful’.</p><p><br></p><p>Be powerful, assert yourself, stand on your own. Don’t fall a victim
to the crowd. Start thinking, start being yourself. And follow your
lonely path – don’t be a sheep!</p><p>Ninety-nine sheep can be left in the forest – there is no fear about
them. They will not be lost because they will huddle together, so they
can be found any moment. The problem is not with them but with the one,
the best, who has left the fold. Whenever a sheep can leave the fold it
means power exists there, and the sheep is not afraid of the forest, not
afraid of the wild animals, not afraid at all; the sheep has become
fearless – only then can she leave the fold. And fearlessness is the
first step of being ready.</p><p><br></p><p>Ego is the first step to surrender. It looks absolutely paradoxical.
You will think that I am mad, because you think that humbleness is
needed. I say, no! – first ego is needed, otherwise your humbleness will
be false. First ego is needed – sharp, sharp like a sword. That will
give you a clarity of being, a distinctness, and then you can drop it;
when you have it you can drop it. Then a humbleness comes and that
humbleness is totally different: it is not the humbleness of the poor,
it is not the humbleness of the weak – it is the humbleness of the
strong, it is the humbleness of the powerful. Then you can yield, but
not before that.</p><p><br></p><p>HE LEFT BEHIND THE NINETY-NINE, HE SOUGHT FOR THE ONE UNTIL HE FOUND
IT.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember you need not go to seek God, he will come to you. Just
become worthy and he will find you, he has to make a path towards you.
The moment someone somewhere becomes crystallized, the whole divine
energy moves towards him. He may reach you as an enlightened man, he may
reach you as a master, as a guru – in millions of ways he can reach you.
But how he reaches you is not the point – that is for him to worry
about, it is not for you to worry about. First attain the ego, be ready,
become individual, and then the universal can happen to you.</p><p><br></p><p>HAVING TIRED HIMSELF OUT, HE SAID TO THE SHEEP: I LOVE YOU MORE.</p><p><br></p><p>The one who has become rebellious, God loves him more. Priests will
say, “What nonsense! One who has gone astray, God loves him more?” The
priests cannot believe it, but this is how it happens. Jesus is the lost
sheep, Buddha is the lost sheep, Mahavira is the lost sheep. The crowd
goes on moving in its mediocrity, while a Mahavira, a Buddha and a Jesus
are sought out – God rushes towards them.</p><p><br></p><p>This happened under the bodhi tree where Buddha was sitting,
perfectly individual, with all the chains of society, culture, religion
broken – all the chains broken, perfectly alone. Then God rushed from
everywhere, from all directions – because he is in all directions – and
Buddha became a god. And he had denied that there is a God, because that
was one of the ways to go astray. He had said, “There is no God, I don’t
believe in any God.” He had said that there is no society, no religion.
He denied the Vedas, he denied the caste system – brahmins, sudras. He
denied the whole Hindu structure of thinking. He said, “I am not a
Hindu, and I don’t belong to any society, and I don’t believe in any
theories. Unless I know the truth I am not going to believe in
anything!”</p><p><br></p><p>He went on denying. A moment came when he was alone and there was no
link with anything, absolutely broken. He became an island, absolutely
alone. Under that bodhi tree, twenty-five centuries ago, God rushed from
everywhere to this man, to this sheep who had gone astray, and told
Buddha.<span class=s4></span>Having tired himself out, he said to the
sheep: I love thee more than the ninety-nine.</p><p>This was also said to Jesus, this has always been so, this is the
foundational law. God seeks the man, not the man God – man just has to
be ready.</p><p>And how to be ready? Become individual, be a revolutionary. Go beyond
the society, be fearless, break all chains, all relationships. Be alone
and exist as if you are the center of the world. Then God rushes towards
you, and in his rush your ego is lost, the island disappears into the
ocean – suddenly you are no more.</p><p><br></p><p>First the society has to be dropped – and that is the inner mechanics
– because your ego can exist only with the society. If you go on
dropping the society, there will come a moment when the ego will be
alone because the society has been dropped. But then without the society
the ego cannot exist, because society helps you to exist as an ego. If
you go on dropping the society, by and by the base is dropped. When
there is no ‘thou’ the ‘I’ cannot exist. At the final stage ‘I’
disappears because ‘thou’ has been dropped. When there is no ‘you’, ‘I’
am not. The ‘you’ has to be dropped, then the ‘I’ drops. But by dropping
‘you’ first, the ‘I’ becomes sharper, crystallized, centered, beautiful,
powerful. Then it is consumed – this is the rush of the divine.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was crucified because of these sayings. He was making people
rebellious, he was teaching them to go astray. He was saying that God
loves the one who has gone astray – the sinner, the rebel, the egoist.
The Jews could not tolerate it, it was too much. This man had to be
silenced: “This man has to be stopped – he is going too far, he will
destroy the whole society!” He was creating a situation in which the
priests would not be able to stand, the church would dissolve.</p><p><br></p><p>He was against the crowd – and the crowd is all that is around you –
and the crowd became panic- stricken. They thought, “This man is the
enemy, he is destroying the very base. Without the crowd how can we
live?” By going and teaching the ninety-nine sheep to go astray, they
will huddle together more. And if you go on teaching them they will take
revenge, they will kill you, they will say, “Enough is enough!”</p><p><br></p><p>We live in the crowd, we are part of the crowd. Alone we cannot
exist. We don’t know how to be alone, we always exist with the other.
The other is needed, it is a must. Without the other who are you? Your
identity is lost.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the problem: ninety-nine sheep create all religions, and the
real religion happens only to the one sheep who has gone astray.</p><p><br></p><p>Be courageous! Move beyond the clearing, go to the wild. Life is
there, and only then will you grow. There may be suffering, because
there is no growth without suffering. There may be a cross, crucifixion,
because without it there is no maturity. Society may take revenge
through crucifixion – accept it. That is bound to happen, because when
the one sheep comes back the ninety-nine will say, “This is the sinner!
This sheep went astray, this one is no part of us, this sheep doesn’t
belong to us!”</p><p><br></p><p>And those ninety-nine sheep will be absolutely unable to conceive
that the shepherd is carrying that sheep on his shoulders – because this
is the lost sheep and it has been found.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says the shepherd will go back to his home, he will call his
friends, and he will have a feast because a sheep was lost and a sheep
has been found. Jesus says whenever a sinner enters into heaven there is
rejoicing, because a sheep has been lost and a sheep has been found.</p><p><br></p><p>Enough for today.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

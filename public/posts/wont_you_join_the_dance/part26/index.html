Love brings wisdom. Wisdom is the shadow of love; without love there is no wisdom. Without love knowledge is possible, much knowledge is possible, but wisdom impossible. Wisdom is the function of the heart, and without love the heart remains dormant. It is the force of love that moves the dynamo of the heart and once the heart is stirred, the seed of wisdom that we are carrying within us starts growing. Sooner or later there is a tree of great wisdom.\nThe tree of knowledge is not the tree of wisdom. In fact the tree of knowledge should be called the tree of ignorance, because nothing keeps man more ignorant than knowledge. It is only by dropping knowledge that someone comes to wisdom. The day one realises ‘I don’t know anything’ is a great day in life. From that moment the heart starts functioning.\nPrem means love jenny means god’s gracious gift. Love is the greatest gift that god has given to us. It is greater than life, because life itself without love is meaningless. Life becomes significant only if it starts growing towards love, if it becomes love\nLife is only an opportunity; love is the fulfilment. Life is a seed; love, the fragrance.\nDeva means divine alva means white, whiteness – divine whiteness. White is a symbol of purity, of utter cleanliness, not even a particle of dust in the soul. When the mirror is so clean that not even a particle of dust is on it, it reflects that which is. The heart has to be also that purity, mirrorlike, only then can god be known.\nGod cannot be known by logical thinking and cannot be known by stupid rituals; it is not that cheap. God can only be known by the purity of the heart. What is the purity of the heart? The purity of the heart is the silence undisturbed by thought, stillness uncontaminated by the mind. The mind is the\nimpure thing. The heart is naturally pure, but the mind is imposed on the heart. The society has put the mind as the master. The master is chained and the slave is ruling: this is the situation.\nSannyas means changing everything from topsy-turvy, putting the master back into its place and reducing the servant to its own work. The mind is beautiful if it is a servant, but not beautiful as a master; then it is a tyrant. The heart is beautiful when it is the master, because it can see what is, and it can live according to that which is, it can follow reality and god.\nIf the heart follows god and the heart is followed by the mind, your life is religious. But right now the situation is that the mind is the leader, the heart has to follow the mind, and god has become completely disconnected from us.\nLet the mind follow the heart, and the heart will automatically follow god. Its very purity is the guarantee.\nPrem means love, arne means black or dark. Darkness has something beautiful about it, it has depth. Light is always shallow because light is always defined. Darkness is undefined, unbounded. Light makes every- thing de-mystified, and the moment things are de-mystified they lose all beauty. Darkness mystifies everything. It makes everything look tremendously enchanting, wonderful; it creates the mysterious. Darkness is also of immense value, because to grow the seed has to go into the dark soil, and to grow the child has to go into the darkness of the mother’s womb. Everything grows in darkness, all energies grow in darkness. Only when they have become mature can they come into the light, otherwise not.\nLove also grows in darkness. One day it comes into the world of light, but the roots always remain in the dark; only the flowers come into the light. To be total a man has to be both, the roots and the flowers. He has to be both rooted in deep darkness and yet looking at the farthest star. In that totality is benediction, that totality is benediction.\nSat means truth, frank means free, freedom. Jesus says ‘Truth liberates.’ That’s exactly the meaning of your name: truth is freedom. Not to know is to be in bondage. Our chains and imprisonments consist of ignorance, and the greatest imprisonment is self-ignorance. To know is to be free, and the first and the greatest freedom is self-knowledge; then everything else follows of its own accord.\nThe essential core of all religions has always been the same: Man, know thyself Modern psychology has stumbled upon the fact that if you can know a certain thing that has been crippling you, the very knowing of it becomes its disappearance. If a dream has been persisting in your life again and again and again, if it is analysed, understood, it disappears; then it never comes. The message has been understood; there is no point now for it to come again. If you understand why you are afraid, you are no more afraid. To know the cause, just to know the cause, brings freedom without any other effort.\nThis has been the greatest discovery of religions; now psychology has again discovered an ancient truth.\n[A sannyasin, leaving, says: I’m totally closed up when I look at you; I can’t relax. I don’t know... I’m sweating now.]\nYes, some fear is there, and the fear has some meaning! The meaning is really good, it is not bad news. People who are really so afraid of me are simply saying that their mind is giving them a signal: no more movement towards this man – there is danger!\nBut now you cannot resist. The temptation is greater than the fear, so just wait! [Osho gives an ‘energy darshan’ to a sannyasin with a terminal disease.]\nVery good! You are doing so well, defeating death! Don’t be worried. You are almost doing the impossible. Anybody in your place would have been born at least nine years before. They would have been nine years old by now! Things are good!\nAll the mediums come here. There are just a few things I have to talk to you about.\nThe first thing to be remembered is that the work that is now given to you is of immense importance, it is no ordinary work. And this is only the beginning; it will have many many dimensions soon. So only those who really surrender totally will be chosen for further dimensions.\nThe function of the medium is to be utterly absent so that I can penetrate your being totally, so that my energy can start flowing through you. Your energy has to become attuned with my energy. The energy that you have is stored at the sex centre; all energy is stored at the sex centre, all energy is basically sexual.\nSo the first arousal of the energy will have a sensuality about it. You are not to repress it, you are not to suppress it; you have to help it to go up. It is the same energy that at a certain point becomes spiritual, divine, but only at a certain point, at a certain intensity. But our minds start repressing it before it reaches that intensity. So many taboos, so many inhibitions, so many stupid ideas, have been taught down the ages that they function automatically. It is not that you repress; just as the sexual energy starts moving, an automatic repression comes in. You have to destroy that automatic reaction in yourself You have to enjoy the sensuous feel of the energy rising, with no fear, with great welcoming and receptivity.\nWhen I say that the energy is rising up in you, you have to start moving and swaying with the energy. It has to be very graceful, very subtle, very aesthetic. You have to be sensitive, because you are moving on very subtle planes; grossness is not needed. But you have to be available to me on all levels, from the lowest to the highest, the whole ladder of your being, so that I can help your energy to reach to the highest peak.\nSo when the energy starts moving it will almost feel as if you are making love. And in fact it is so: you are making love to existence itself So start moving, swaying, in the same way that you will move while you are making deep love, while you are in deep intimacy with somebody. Abandon yourself and go totally into it. The same thrust will be there, the same movements, the same sounds of joy will start coming. Don’t repress them; let them, allow them, help them. Meaningless sounds and words will come, sometimes from your past lives, sometimes when you were animalS. sometimes when you were birds, and sometimes when you were trees – the past is infinite. Like clouds, fragmentS Will start coming; you have to allow them.\nWhen I say ‘Go ecstatic’ you have to allow everything; you have to be totally in a state which will be thought of as mad. All this time the light will remain off, because the energies can grow only in darkness. And the moment I put the light on. three are the possibilities. One: I may put the light on while you are in that mad ecstatic state; you are not to repress it. If I put the light on, you have to continue in your mad ecstatic state. The second possibility is: before putting the light on, I will say ‘Cool down and let the energy disappear into the earth.’ Then you cool down and let the energy disappear; then you will become very silent, very still. No wind, and the trees are just still. But still your face will have the fragrance of ecstasy. It will not be like a laughter, it will be like a smile, very subtle – a grace, a joy, a rejoicing, but not loud, not wild. Your hands will be in a receptive mood, your body will be in a graceful posture. Then I will put the light on.\nThe third possibility is that I may put the light on and you are in a wild state and suddenly I say ‘Stop!’. Then without relaxing the energy and letting it go into the earth, stop as you are: if your hand is raised then your hand is raised, if your eyes are turned upwards then your head remains that way. Whatsoever the state, immediately become frozen. These are the three possibilities. It will depend on the person who has come for the close-up. I will call the person the guest.\nHe is a guest in my energy-field. I am the host; you are my bridges to him. So it will depend on the guest what kind of situation will be more helpful to him – wild, ecstatic, sudden stop; or a very very cool, slow settling. Good.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1854","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/wont_you_join_the_dance/part26/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/wont_you_join_the_dance/>Won\'t You Join the Dance</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">26</h1><div class=post-meta>9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1854 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Wont_You_Join_the_Dance/part26.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part25>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Love is the most courageous quality of human consciousness, because love can risk all. It is the very centre of courage, because it can even encounter death. The man of fear cannot love and cannot even allow anybody to love him. The man who can love and can allow himself to be loved, slowly slowly forgets what fear is; fear becomes a forgotten language. It should become a forgotten language, but that very rarely happens. What happens is that love becomes a forgotten language. For the majority of human beings, love means nothing; it is an empty word. Fear means all; it is very substantial.\nFor the sannyasin, there is needed to be a total conversion. Fear becomes nothing, an empty word, and love becomes all. Then god is not far away, because love is god.\nDeva means divine; alf means wise, wisdom – divinely wise or divine wisdom. Knowledge is human, hence knowledge never becomes wisdom. Knowledge is a creation of your mind; it always remains so-so, arbitrary, hypothetical. Wisdom descends. It is not a creation of the mind – on the contrary, when the mind ceases to function, when it gives way for the divine ray to enter in you, then only does it happen. It is a gift from god, hence it is infallible. And it is not a hypothesis, it is absolute. The whole world will go on changing but wisdom remains the same. All Buddhas say the same thing. The languages differ, obviously, the expressions differ, certainly, but what is expressed, what is indicated, is exactly the same. It may be Jesus or Confucius or Socrates; it makes no difference at all. All those fingers are pointing to the same moon.\nDon’t be confined to human knowledge and inhuman knowledge. Strive to be open, surrendered, for the divine to descend in you. And the moment one is open, it immediately happens, instantly happens. It is just for the asking or just for the taking.\nChristian means to be with Christ. And that’s exactly what sannyas is all about – to be with Christ.\nChrist is not the name of any person. Jesus is only one of the Christs; there have been many, there will be many.\nChrist is not a personal name, it is a state of consciousness. Lao Tzu is a Christ, Jalaluddin is a Christ, and the day you become enlightened you are a Christ. But meanwhile, when you are not enlightened and you are not a Christ, the best thing to be, the next best thing to be is to be a Christian, at least – to be with Christ, to aspire, to long for the Christ-consciousness.\nMeditation is the bridge which will make you a Christ. Never be satisfied with being just a Christian. That is the beginning, and it is beautiful as a beginning, but it is not the end: the end is to be Christ. And each human being has the potential to be Christ. If we don’t fulfil it, we will remain in discontent. It has to be fulfilled. Once it is fulfilled there is all contentment, all joy, all celebration.\nVeet means beyond. Thomas is one of the apostles of Jesus, but because he was of a doubting nature, full of doubts – which is very natural, human – his name has become a symbol of doubt: Doubting Thomas. But one thing has to be remembered: doubt arises only when one tries to trust. It is not necessarily a calamity. It never arises in people who are not searching for trust. There are millions of people who have no doubt; that does not mean that they have trust, that simply means that they don’t care, that they are not bothered. They are not searching for truth, hence there is no doubt either.\nWhen one starts searching for trust, when one wants to trust, doubt arises. So, doubt is not necessarily evil; it is a by-product of the searching, enquiring mind. But I am not saying that it is something to be protected, saved, treasured, no. One has to go beyond it. One has to go through it and one has to go beyond it. So there are two steps: one of doubt, and another of trust.\nVeet means: go beyond the doubting mind, transcend it. To be in trust is a tremendously blissful state. Worries simply disappear, hesitations wither away, darkness is no more there. All those things are created by doubt; doubt starts eating the very roots of your being.\nThere are three kinds of people. The first one has no doubt but no trust either – that is the state of the majority of people, a very ugly state; the desire for truth has not arisen yet. Then the second person, in whom the desire has arisen, and with the desire, the shadow of doubt; it is far better than the first. And then the third is one who has arrived in trust; the shadow has disappeared, it is all light.\nIt is said that in heaven, people walk but no shadows are created. It is a beautiful symbol: when trust is total there is no shadow of doubt. Trust is so transparent that it is like glass, so transparent that it makes no shadow. That is the goal.\nPrem means love, christine means a follower of Christ. Love is the message of Christ. Moses is more a law, a commandment, a code of conduct. He was more concerned with what to do, what not to do – but that was the need of the people in those days. That was the first step, to create character. Once character is created, then the shift is possible from character to consciousness.\nJesus is the second step. Moses brings law to the world, Jesus brings love. Love does not think in terms of what to do and what not to do, but in terms of what to be. It is a deeper quality. Action is on the surface, being is at the centre.\nSomebody asked Saint Augustine ‘I am very ignorant, I don’t know anything of religion and the scriptures; but can you tell me in short, very short, the essence of all religion, so that I can follow it?’\nIt is said that Augustine closed his eyes, meditated for a time, then opened his eyes and said ‘Love. That is the very essence – and if you love, then whatsoever you do is right. Out of love, wrong is impossible; and without love, right is impossible.’\nSo if one really wants to attain to Christ-consciousness, then love is the way.\nAnand means bliss – and I also don’t know what rheba means, but that is irrelevant. Be blissful, that is the point. Be a blissful Rheba, whatsoever it means! And you can be very blissful, you have the quality, and it is easily available.\nThere are people who have the quality, everybody has the quality to be blissful, but it is hidden behind so much rubbish that if you go on digging and digging and digging, only then one day, maybe after years or after lives, will you find the treasure.\nBut your treasure is not very far away. Just a little cleaning – not digging, just dusting, even a vacuum cleaner will do – and the bliss will start!\n[A sannyasin, leaving, says: I’m not sure if I’m going to be more remembering or forgetting myself. Osho checks his energy.]\nGood. Go into absolute forgetfulness. Forget remembering; that won’t help you. Your eyes are already turning upwards, mm? That is a sign of forgetfulness, and that is going to help you.\nThese are the two paths: either remember totally or be drowned totally; and the eyes immediately show what exactly will be helpful to you, what will be natural to you. Don’t try to remember, try to forget everything – forget yourself, forget everything. Just be a forgetfulness, and in that very forgetfulness you will start feeling god. God will not come to you as truth; god will come to you as beauty, as love. God will never come to you like a concept, but it will be a feeling.\nSo you can choose easily, and there is no problem in it. Don’t create a confusion.\n[A Japanese sannyasin says he has difficulty opening to anything western because of his traditional japanese background and language.]\nIf something is really good, clinging is not needed, one can be simply open. If something is really good, it does not require clinging; you can be open because you know that the thing is going to remain there. In fact it is the fear that keeps you clinging and closed. Deep down you are afraid that what you call good is not good, may not be good. Deep down you are afraid that if you open up, your cherished tradition may disappear. It is fear and doubt. If you really love something and you know it is good, you remain open – what is the fear? You remain vulnerable, you can face it. And if something is wrong and drops, it is for the good; nothing is wrong. Even if it is Japanese and is wrong and drops, good!\nBut be open. To be open is very decisive – because when you are open, then only that which is really good can remain with you, and that which is not really good automatically disappears.\nIt is hard, I know. It is harder for a Japanese than for anybody else: he has been brought up very traditionally, and he is very proud. But you will have to be open. If you really want to decide what is good and what is not good, it can be decided only by being open. This is the miracle of openness: the false disappears and the true settles. So if something is good in the Japanese tradition, and there is much good, that will remain, that will abide with you. So drop fear.\nI have lived totally openly, but anything that is good anywhere has not left me – in fact it has become more and more deeply rooted in me. Not only the Indian, but all that is good, anywhere, in any culture, in any race, in any country, has become part of me. The more open you are, the bigger is your heritage; you can contain the whole universe.\nOpen up! Good.\n[Before giving the ‘come close energy darshans’, Osho addresses all the mediums.]\nThe first thing: to be a medium means a shift of energy from the left-side hemisphere of your brain to the right-side hemisphere. People are living only fifty percent of their life; only half of their mind is functioning – and the mind that is functioning is the mundane mind that calculates, that is cunning, that does all the business. The mind that is functioning is not of any worth. At the most it gives you a living but not a life.\nThe other mind, which is far superior, the right hemisphere, is completely blocked. The right hemisphere contains all poetry, all music, all love, all that is beautiful, all that is worth living for, all that makes life meaningful and significant.\nTo become a medium means to shift the energy. And the only possible way to shift the energy, I say the only way, is through your sexual energy. Your sexual energy is still part of the right-side hemisphere. That is the only possible hope left for humanity. That is the only thin thread through which you can move to the right-side hemisphere, otherwise everything has been taken possession of by the left side.\nSo while you are absorbing my energy feel utterly sexual, sensuous. In the beginning it will look very sexual. Soon there comes a point of intensity when it starts changing, when it starts becoming something that you have not known before at all, something that can only be called spiritual – but only later on, and only if you go totally into it. If you inhibit, your taboos come in and you stop yourself, then it remains sexual, it never becomes spiritual.\nAll taboos, all inhibitions, have to be dropped; only then at a certain intensity does the transformation happen. Suddenly you are thrown from the left hemisphere to the right hemisphere – and the right hemisphere is the hemisphere of the mystics.\nThere is an ancient fable of a Hassid mystic. He asked one of his disciples ‘What do we mean when we use the word ’god’?’ The disciple wouldn’t answer. Thrice the master asked and the disciple wouldn’t answer. The master was really angry and he said ‘Why don’t you answer me?’ And the\ndisciple said ‘Because I don’t know god!’ The master started laughing and he said ‘Do you think I know?’\nGod is not a question of knowing at all, it is a question of feeling. Nobody has ever known god. Those who think they have known, have not really known but felt. It is the function of the right hemisphere of the mind. So the deeper you enter into the right hemisphere, and as your energies start moving in the right hemisphere, you are more and more close to me, to god, to yourself, to everything that is.\nThis is the first thing to remember. The second thing to remember is: when you are joyous your energy flows into the other; when you are sad you start sucking energy from the other. So while functioning as mediums, be as joyous, ecstatically joyous, as possible; only then will your energy start moving into the guest. Only then will you shower your energy into the guest, only then will he start overflowing. Joy is contagious. So you are not to be a medium out of duty; it has to be a joyous celebration.\nThe third thing: your bodies are musical instruments. The medium has to be just a harp in the hands of the master, sol can play on the music of your body, sol can help the music become awake in you. It has to be a very musical process, very graceful, very caressing, loving. When you play upon a musical instrument, you caress it with each touch. You have to become my harps, and you have to remember that – to be very very soft, open, vulnerable, available.\nA little resistance from your side and the music will disappear. Then you can go on moving in an empty gesture. It will be empty, of no use; it will make you tired. If you are not making an empty gesture, the guest is going to be helped and you are going to be helped; both are benefited. In fact the mediums will be benefited more, because they will be available every day.\nThe fourth thing: the first medium, on whom I will be working more, has to function as a triggering point. So whatsoever starts happening in the first medium, you have to fall in tune with her, you have to just move with the first, you have to be just one with the first. And you will be surprised: what is happening to the first will start happening to you all, exactly the same, because it is not a question of the physical body, it is a question of an energy-field. I am just creating an energyfield: if you are ready, the first will be the triggering point and soon you will be taken possession of. So wherever you are – a few people will be standing here behind the guest, a few mediums will be sitting.Those\nwho are sitting, they can also participate just by sitting there.\nThe fifth thing: this is not only a small experiment to help the guest; this is to transform the whole energy-field of the commune. Right now it is a small commune. I was waiting for the new commune, but I think it will be delayed a little more, hence I decided that the work has to start. But in a way it is good: if you can fill these six acres of land with your energy, then it will make you able to fill the new commune. The new commune will be big, at least three square miles. But if you can fill six acres of land with your energy, it will not be difficult to fill the three square miles. It is not a question of how big the place is; the question is whether you have got the knack of it.\nSo before the new commune happens I am trying to give you the knack of it. And it has started happening: the whole commune is affected. Even people who have not participated, who have not been here at all, even in their rooms they are affected.\nFrom tomorrow, the time for energy communion will be the time when all the lights in the ashram will go off. All activities will stop; for that half hour or forty-five minutes there will be utter darkness and all activities will stop.\nPeople, wherever they are, have to sit silently and be in a receptive mood, and whatsoever starts happening to them – there in their room, in the garden, wherever they are sitting, on the roof – they have to allow.\nSo this will be the beginning, and once the experiment succeeds here, then I can prepare a bigger group for the new commune, because then there will be the need of a bigger group.\nThe sixth point: the people who are sitting here in silent darshan, they can also participate. But they have to be aware: when the group is ecstatic, they can be ecstatic; when the group falls silent, they have to fall silent; when the group becomes absolutely quiet, they have to become quiet, otherwise they will be a disturbance. But when the group is going into ecstasy, into movement, into wild laughter, they can also. So you can also participate with closed eyes.\n\u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"3031","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/wont_you_join_the_dance/part28/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/wont_you_join_the_dance/>Won\'t You Join the Dance</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">28</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3031 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Wont_You_Join_the_Dance/part28.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part27>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p><span id=bookmark27>‌</span>CHAPTER <span class=s3>28</span></p><p><br></p><p>28 February 1979 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium</p><p><br></p><p>Prem means love, eberhard means brave.

in whom the desire has arisen, and with the desire, the shadow of doubt;
it is far better than the first. And then the third is one who has
arrived in trust; the shadow has disappeared, it is all light.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that in heaven, people walk but no shadows are created. It
is a beautiful symbol: when trust is total there is no shadow of doubt.
Trust is so transparent that it is like glass, so transparent that it
makes no shadow. That is the goal.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem means love, christine means a follower of Christ. Love is the
message of Christ. Moses is more a law, a commandment, a code of
conduct. He was more concerned with what to do, what not to do – but
that was the need of the people in those days. That was the first step,
to create character. Once character is created, then the shift is
possible from character to consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus is the second step. Moses brings law to the world, Jesus brings
love. Love does not think in terms of what to do and what not to do, but
in terms of what to be. It is a deeper quality. Action is on the
surface, being is at the centre.</p><p>Somebody asked Saint Augustine ‘I am very ignorant, I don’t know
anything of religion and the scriptures; but can you tell me in short,
very short, the essence of all religion, so that I can follow it?’</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that Augustine closed his eyes, meditated for a time, then
opened his eyes and said ‘Love. That is the very essence – and if you
love, then whatsoever you do is right. Out of love, wrong is impossible;
and without love, right is impossible.’</p><p><br></p><p>So if one really wants to attain to Christ-consciousness, then love
is the way.</p><p><br></p><p>Anand means bliss – and I also don’t know what rheba means, but that
is irrelevant. Be blissful, that is the point. Be a blissful Rheba,
whatsoever it means! And you can be very blissful, you have the quality,
and it is easily available.</p><p><br></p><p>There are people who have the quality, everybody has the quality to
be blissful, but it is hidden behind so much rubbish that if you go on
digging and digging and digging, only then one day, maybe after years or
after lives, will you find the treasure.</p><p><br></p><p>But your treasure is not very far away. Just a little cleaning – not
digging, just dusting, even a vacuum cleaner will do – and the bliss
will start!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, leaving, says: I’m not sure if I’m going to be more
remembering or forgetting myself. Osho checks his energy.]</p><p>Good. Go into absolute forgetfulness. Forget remembering; that won’t
help you. Your eyes are already turning upwards, mm? That is a sign of
forgetfulness, and that is going to help you.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the two paths: either remember totally or be drowned
totally; and the eyes immediately show what exactly will be helpful to
you, what will be natural to you. Don’t try to remember, try to forget
everything – forget yourself, forget everything. Just be a
forgetfulness, and in that very forgetfulness you will start feeling
god. God will not come to you as truth; god will come to you as beauty,
as love. God will never come to you like a concept, but it will be a
feeling.</p><p><br></p><p>So you can choose easily, and there is no problem in it. Don’t create
a confusion.</p><p><br></p><p>[A Japanese sannyasin says he has difficulty opening to anything
western because of his traditional japanese background and
language.]</p><p><br></p><p>If something is really good, clinging is not needed, one can be
simply open. If something is really good, it does not require clinging;
you can be open because you know that the thing is going to remain
there. In fact it is the fear that keeps you clinging and closed. Deep
down you are afraid that what you call good is not good, may not be
good. Deep down you are afraid that if you open up, your cherished
tradition may disappear. It is fear and doubt. If you really love
something and you know it is good, you remain open – what is the fear?
You remain vulnerable, you can face it. And if something is wrong and
drops, it is for the good; nothing is wrong. Even if it is Japanese and
is wrong and drops, good!</p><p>But be open. To be open is very decisive – because when you are open,
then only that which is really good can remain with you, and that which
is not really good automatically disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>It is hard, I know. It is harder for a Japanese than for anybody
else: he has been brought up very traditionally, and he is very proud.
But you will have to be open. If you really want to decide what is good
and what is not good, it can be decided only by being open. This is the
miracle of openness: the false disappears and the true settles. So if
something is good in the Japanese tradition, and there is much good,
that will remain, that will abide with you. So drop fear.</p><p><br></p><p>I have lived totally openly, but anything that is good anywhere has
not left me – in fact it has become more and more deeply rooted in me.
Not only the Indian, but all that is good, anywhere, in any culture, in
any race, in any country, has become part of me. The more open you are,
the bigger is your heritage; you can contain the whole universe.</p><p><br></p><p>Open up! Good.</p><p><br></p><p>[Before giving the ‘come close energy darshans’, Osho addresses all
the mediums.]</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing: to be a medium means a shift of energy from the
left-side hemisphere of your brain to the right-side hemisphere. People
are living only fifty percent of their life; only half of their mind is
functioning – and the mind that is functioning is the mundane mind that
calculates, that is cunning, that does all the business. The mind that
is functioning is not of any worth. At the most it gives you a living
but not a life.</p><p><br></p><p>The other mind, which is far superior, the right hemisphere, is
completely blocked. The right hemisphere contains all poetry, all music,
all love, all that is beautiful, all that is worth living for, all that
makes life meaningful and significant.</p><p><br></p><p>To become a medium means to shift the energy. And the only possible
way to shift the energy, I say the only way, is through your sexual
energy. Your sexual energy is still part of the right-side hemisphere.
That is the only possible hope left for humanity. That is the only thin
thread through which you can move to the right-side hemisphere,
otherwise everything has been taken possession of by the left side.</p><p><br></p><p>So while you are absorbing my energy feel utterly sexual, sensuous.
In the beginning it will look very sexual. Soon there comes a point of
intensity when it starts changing, when it starts becoming something
that you have not known before at all, something that can only be called
spiritual – but only later on, and only if you go totally into it. If
you inhibit, your taboos come in and you stop yourself, then it remains
sexual, it never becomes spiritual.</p><p><br></p><p>All taboos, all inhibitions, have to be dropped; only then at a
certain intensity does the transformation happen. Suddenly you are
thrown from the left hemisphere to the right hemisphere – and the right
hemisphere is the hemisphere of the mystics.</p><p><br></p><p>There is an ancient fable of a Hassid mystic. He asked one of his
disciples ‘What do we mean when we use the word ’god’?’ The disciple
wouldn’t answer. Thrice the master asked and the disciple wouldn’t
answer. The master was really angry and he said ‘Why don’t you answer
me?’ And the</p><p>disciple said ‘Because I don’t know god!’ The master started laughing
and he said ‘Do you think I know?’</p><p><br></p><p>God is not a question of knowing at all, it is a question of feeling.
Nobody has ever known god. Those who think they have known, have not
really known but felt. It is the function of the right hemisphere of the
mind. So the deeper you enter into the right hemisphere, and as your
energies start moving in the right hemisphere, you are more and more
close to me, to god, to yourself, to everything that is.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the first thing to remember. The second thing to remember is:
when you are joyous your energy flows into the other; when you are sad
you start sucking energy from the other. So while functioning as
mediums, be as joyous, ecstatically joyous, as possible; only then will
your energy start moving into the guest. Only then will you shower your
energy into the guest, only then will he start overflowing. Joy is
contagious. So you are not to be a medium out of duty; it has to be a
joyous celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>The third thing: your bodies are musical instruments. The medium has
to be just a harp in the hands of the master, sol can play on the music
of your body, sol can help the music become awake in you. It has to be a
very musical process, very graceful, very caressing, loving. When you
play upon a musical instrument, you caress it with each touch. You have
to become my harps, and you have to remember that – to be very very
soft, open, vulnerable, available.</p><p><br></p><p>A little resistance from your side and the music will disappear. Then
you can go on moving in an empty gesture. It will be empty, of no use;
it will make you tired. If you are not making an empty gesture, the
guest is going to be helped and you are going to be helped; both are
benefited. In fact the mediums will be benefited more, because they will
be available every day.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth thing: the first medium, on whom I will be working more,
has to function as a triggering point. So whatsoever starts happening in
the first medium, you have to fall in tune with her, you have to just
move with the first, you have to be just one with the first. And you
will be surprised: what is happening to the first will start happening
to you all, exactly the same, because it is not a question of the
physical body, it is a question of an energy-field. I am just creating
an energyfield: if you are ready, the first will be the triggering point
and soon you will be taken possession of. So wherever you are – a few
people will be standing here behind the guest, a few mediums will be
sitting.<span class=s4></span>Those</p><p>who are sitting, they can also participate just by sitting there.</p><p><br></p><p>The fifth thing: this is not only a small experiment to help the
guest; this is to transform the whole energy-field of the commune. Right
now it is a small commune. I was waiting for the new commune, but I
think it will be delayed a little more, hence I decided that the work
has to start. But in a way it is good: if you can fill these six acres
of land with your energy, then it will make you able to fill the new
commune. The new commune will be big, at least three square miles. But
if you can fill six acres of land with your energy, it will not be
difficult to fill the three square miles. It is not a question of how
big the place is; the question is whether you have got the knack of
it.</p><p><br></p><p>So before the new commune happens I am trying to give you the knack
of it. And it has started happening: the whole commune is affected. Even
people who have not participated, who have not been here at all, even in
their rooms they are affected.</p><p>From tomorrow, the time for energy communion will be the time when
all the lights in the ashram will go off. All activities will stop; for
that half hour or forty-five minutes there will be utter darkness and
all activities will stop.</p><p><br></p><p>People, wherever they are, have to sit silently and be in a receptive
mood, and whatsoever starts happening to them – there in their room, in
the garden, wherever they are sitting, on the roof – they have to
allow.</p><p><br></p><p>So this will be the beginning, and once the experiment succeeds here,
then I can prepare a bigger group for the new commune, because then
there will be the need of a bigger group.</p><p><br></p><p>The sixth point: the people who are sitting here in silent darshan,
they can also participate. But they have to be aware: when the group is
ecstatic, they can be ecstatic; when the group falls silent, they have
to fall silent; when the group becomes absolutely quiet, they have to
become quiet, otherwise they will be a disturbance. But when the group
is going into ecstasy, into movement, into wild laughter, they can also.
So you can also participate with closed eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part27>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/turn_on_tune_in_and_drop_the_lot/part28/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>28</span>

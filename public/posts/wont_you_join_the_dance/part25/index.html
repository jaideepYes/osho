Prem means love, vincent means victory – victory that comes through love, the victory that love is. Any other kind of victory is only apparent, only love gives you the real thing, because every other kind of victory is forced, violent; sooner or later there is going to be vengeance, revolt, reaction.

Any other kind of victory is only apparent, only love gives you the real thing, because every other kind of victory is forced, violent; sooner or later there is going to be vengeance, revolt, reaction. Only love knows no revolt, because love is not an enforcement: it is a gift.\nAnd love is a paradox, because it becomes victorious – not by becoming victorious but by surrendering, not by conquering but by surrendering. It allows itself to be defeated; that is the mystery of love. And in that very thing is the secret of victory. That victory is eternal which comes through love.\n[A sannyasin, leaving, says she has many things to say, but: but seeing you is enough.]\nJust remember that life knows no death. Remember that you are not the body, not the illness. Remember that you will be forever and forever.\nOnce this is understood, all fears disappear. We are part of god, we are gods. We have been here forever and we are going to be here forever; only forms will change. And It Is good that the form changes; when one form has been used, it has to be thrown – another form, another life another dimension. Each end is a new beginning.\nAnd remain rejoicing. Whatsoever happens to the body, don’t be worried: it is not happening to you. And I will be with you!\nSat means being; jani is Hebrew, it means god’s gracious gift. The greatest gift has already been given to us – that is our being. The greatest gift is that we are; nothing more can be greater than this. Everything else becomes possible only because of this. This is the opportunity for everything\nelse; without it nothing is possible. But there are millions of people who never think to thank god for life, for being, for existence. On the contrary, they go on complaining about small things, trivia.\nThe turning point in life comes only when complaints disappear, and instead of complaints, gratitude arises – that conversion. And sannyas has to be that conversion. From this moment, think of life as a precious gift and remain thankful each moment for it.\nAnand means bliss, sonal means golden – golden bliss. Man can live in the dark valleys of life, but he can also climb to the sunlit peaks. Man has both the alternatives open. Man is a ladder. You can go to hell on the same ladder as you can go to heaven. All depends on the direction; the ladder is the same. Man can be just dust unto dust, and man can also be divine.\nLife is an opportunity to transform the lower into the higher, to transform the darker into the lighter, to transform dust into the divine. Sannyas can make it possible. Sannyas is nothing but an alchemy.\nPrem means love; in Latin cornelis is the name of a tree – tree of love. Man is only a seed, he has to become a tree. The seed we bring with us, but very few people ever make any effort to find the right soil. Very few people really are aware that they are only seeds, potentialities, not actualities. Ninetynine point nine percent of people take life for granted, as if it has already happened – it has not happened yet! It has happened to a Jesus, to a Buddha, but it has not happened to everybody. It can happen, but it can be missed also.\nEach step has to be taken very carefully, because the true door is one and the false are many. To reach the goal is almost an impossibility, because it is so dark and we are so blind and we have no idea of who we are, from where we come, to where we are going, or why in the first place we are here. We have no idea, no notion; it is groping in the dark. But the groping can be done with more alertness, with more attentiveness, with more totality, with more intensity – and then, slowly slowly, the darkness is not so dark; a little light starts arising.\nOut of our own intensity, light is born. Out of our own totality in any act, a certain luminosity arises; and those small acts which become luminous become lamps on the way. Even to have a small lamp is enough. One should not be worried: ‘How am I going to travel such a long journey with such a small lamp? – because it throws light out only three feet ahead.’ That is enough; when you have moved three feet, it again throws light three feet ahead.\nLao Tzu says that with a small lamp the distance of ten thousand miles can be crossed. Sannyas is a small lamp, a small step, but it carries within it the infinity.\nAnand means blissful; nicolee is Greek, it means victory – blissful victory. Life can become a blissful victory. Ordinarily it becomes only a miserable defeat. If we don’t do anything, it is going to become a failure. The failure comes of its own accord. One need not be very intelligent to bring it, one need not make any effort to arrive at the failure. It comes searching for you. It is easier to fall, because it is downhill. It takes a little effort, risk, courage, to go uphill – and victory is uphill; it is going to the sunlit peaks of life. And the higher you go, the lonelier you will feel. The lower you are, the more you will feel surrounded by the crowds.\nLife is like a pyramid. The base is very big; as you go higher, at the highest point you will be alone. That’s why much courage is needed to be victorious – the courage to be alone, the courage to be free, free from the crowd, free from the crowd-mind, free from the psychology of the mob. One has to be a lion; to be victorious, not a sheep. But each step towards victory is a blessing. Only those who reach to the highest peaks of life know what a precious gift has been given and how people are wasting it.\nDeva means divine; nikolaus is Greek; it means victory – divine victory. Remember, all victory is God’s victory, and all defeat is our defeat. All that is good is his, and all that is bad is ours.\nEvil is our creation, it is man’s invention. We have created a very ugly and miserable world, but God is not responsible for it. He gave us paradise; we refused it. We refused for a stupid reason: we wanted to eat the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. So we have enough knowledge and no life, enough knowledge and no love, enough knowledge and no wonder, enough knowledge and nothing worth living for or nothing to live for.\nThis is something very fundamental: whatsoever reason, intellect says is real, is not worth living for; and whatsoever the heart says is worth living for, reason says that it is unreal, it is imagination and nothing else. This is the dichotomy of man. Those who listen to the head go on living a life which is more like a wasteland than a garden. Listen to the heart, and slowly slowly the desert is transformed into an oasis. But whatsoever happens, thank God for it; and whenever you go wrong, feel responsible for going wrong. All is good is his, all bad is ours. Let this be your work upon yourself.\nPrem means love; joyce is Old French, it means rejoicing. Rejoice in love, and that is all there is to prayer. Rejoice in love, and that is all there is to god. Those who can rejoice in love need no other religion. Love is the highest religion, in fact the only religion.\nBut, down the centuries, the priests have made people very sad – because they based their religion on a kind of paranoia, fear, they based their religion on pathology. They did not create a holy man, because they did not create a whole man. They created saints but they were not wholly, they were partial. They were not perfect circles; much was denied. And when you deny much, the life juices stop flowing in you. When you deny much, you have to cut many roots, you have to depend on fewer roots than you needed. When you deny much, you become uprooted, and life becomes sad, loses joyousness – the song, the poetry, the music. Religions created a sad earth.\nMy effort through sannyas is to bring rejoicing back to religion, so people can again dance for god, in god, through god – so god is no more a sad concept but laughter, is no more theology but poetry. Then a totally different kind of life arises out of it.\nAnd remember one fundamental fact. Jesus says ‘Those who have, more shall be given to them; and those who don’t have, even that which they have will be taken away.’\nIt is one of the greatest sayings ever. In fact I have not come across any other saying of any other enlightened person that can be compared to this statement. It is a very strange statement. On the surface it looks unfair, unjust: ‘Those who have, more shall be given to them; and those who don’t have, even that which they have will be taken away.’\nBut what can Jesus do? It is so: if you rejoice, more and more joy will be showering on you. If you are sad, all the sadness from every nook and corner of life will start flowing to you. We attract that which we become... now let it become your very existence.\n[A sannyasin was supposed to have an ‘energy darshan’ with Osho last night, but had developed a fever and was unable to attend. He feels part of him was resistant, fighting.]\nDon’t ask for the impossible. You cannot do anything totally at this moment, at this stage. Whatsoever you do, if it is sixty, seventy percent, that is almost perfect. To be one hundred percent total means to become enlightened. Nothing is remaining then; what will the barrier be?\nAt the most, right now do whatsoever the major part of your being wants to do. So what do you want? If you want an energy darshan you can have it. Or if you are still afraid and more afraid, then...\n[After giving him an ‘energy darshan’ Osho says:]\nYou were unnecessarily afraid. Things are perfectly good. Next time I will give you a bigger dose!\n[Osho spoke about the come close darshans in the discourse this morning. He had been talking about energy]\nEnergy is delight. Desire is energy, energy is delight. Contemplate over it – just pure desire, just overflowing energy, for no particular object, with no destination. That’s what you have to remember when you come to me for an energy darshan, for a close-up. Just become pure desire, just an overflowing desire for nothing in particular. Don’t wait for any experience. Experiences will come, but don’t wait for them. If you wait, you will miss, because when you are waiting for the experience you are no more in the herenow. You have already missed the point; the mind has come in. The object has obstructed the purity of the desire.\nWhen you are in an energy darshan with me, when you are partaking of something of my energy, just be pure desire – going nowhere, moving nowhere, just thrilled for no reason at all, just madly ecstatic for no reason at all. And in those few moments you will have the contact with me, because those few moments are my reality.\nBut if you are sitting there, waiting to have some great experience of light inside you, then maybe you may experience some light, but you missed: you threw the diamonds away and gathered pebbles on the shore. You may be waiting for your kundalini to rise: you may have a certain sensation rising in your spine, but what is it? It is pointless! It may give you a kick, a spiritual kick, but then it is gone.\nWith me, be just pure desire – swaying with me, moving with me, dancing with me, allow me to penetrate you to your deepest core, to the deepest core of your desire, to the very seed. Then something immense, something incredible, something you cannot imagine, is possible: an entry of the beyond into you, the meeting of the earth and the sky.…\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2142","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/wont_you_join_the_dance/part25/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/wont_you_join_the_dance/>Won\'t You Join the Dance</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">25</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2142 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Wont_You_Join_the_Dance/part25.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part24>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

across any other saying of any other enlightened person that can be
compared to this statement. It is a very strange statement. On the
surface it looks unfair, unjust: ‘Those who have, more shall be given to
them; and those who don’t have, even that which they have will be taken
away.’</p><p>But what can Jesus do? It is so: if you rejoice, more and more joy
will be showering on you. If you are sad, all the sadness from every
nook and corner of life will start flowing to you. We attract that which
we become... now let it become your very existence.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin was supposed to have an ‘energy darshan’ with Osho last
night, but had developed a fever and was unable to attend. He feels part
of him was resistant, fighting.]</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t ask for the impossible. You cannot do anything totally at this
moment, at this stage. Whatsoever you do, if it is sixty, seventy
percent, that is almost perfect. To be one hundred percent total means
to become enlightened. Nothing is remaining then; what will the barrier
be?</p><p><br></p><p>At the most, right now do whatsoever the major part of your being
wants to do. So what do you want? If you want an energy darshan you can
have it. Or if you are still afraid and more afraid, then...</p><p><br></p><p>[After giving him an ‘energy darshan’ Osho says:]</p><p><br></p><p>You were unnecessarily afraid. Things are perfectly good. Next time I
will give you a bigger dose!</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho spoke about the come close darshans in the discourse this
morning. He had been talking about energy<span class=s4></span>]</p><p><br></p><p>Energy is delight. Desire is energy, energy is delight. Contemplate
over it – just pure desire, just overflowing energy, for no particular
object, with no destination. That’s what you have to remember when you
come to me for an energy darshan, for a close-up. Just become pure
desire, just an overflowing desire for nothing in particular. Don’t wait
for any experience. Experiences will come, but don’t wait for them. If
you wait, you will miss, because when you are waiting for the experience
you are no more in the herenow. You have already missed the point; the
mind has come in. The object has obstructed the purity of the
desire.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are in an energy darshan with me, when you are partaking of
something of my energy, just be pure desire – going nowhere, moving
nowhere, just thrilled for no reason at all, just madly ecstatic for no
reason at all. And in those few moments you will have the contact with
me, because those few moments are my reality.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you are sitting there, waiting to have some great experience
of light inside you, then maybe you may experience some light, but you
missed: you threw the diamonds away and gathered pebbles on the shore.
You may be waiting for your kundalini to rise: you may have a certain
sensation rising in your spine, but what is it? It is pointless! It may
give you a kick, a spiritual kick, but then it is gone.</p><p><br></p><p>With me, be just pure desire – swaying with me, moving with me,
dancing with me, allow me to penetrate you to your deepest core, to the
deepest core of your desire, to the very seed. Then something immense,
something incredible, something you cannot imagine, is possible: an
entry of the beyond into you, the meeting of the earth and the sky.…</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part24>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

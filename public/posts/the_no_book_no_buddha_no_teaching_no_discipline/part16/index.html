They are good people but they are trapped and it happens that good people are easily trapped because they are not cunning. It is very difficult to trap cunning persons. The people who are searching and have a vague desire for god, who are not satisfied with the world as it is, who are not satisfied the way they are, start seeking and searching, and naturally whatsoever is available they fall into.\nAnd the established religion is always available. It is very difficult to find a master but teachers are always available, the priest is always available. You need not go anywhere: he is just int he neighbourhood.\nSo when people start seeking and searching the first thing they stumble upon is the priest, and naturally one of their own religion in which they have been brought up. It fits with their conditioning, it appeals to their ego; they can understand its language. Everything seems to be right – and nothing is right.\nTell them: seek the christ and don’t be trapped by the priest. The priest has always been against christ and will always remain against christ. You will find many beautiful souls there – help them!\nVeet Chinta.… It means the end of worry... and let this moment be the end of all your worries. You have worried enough, more than was needed. Now drop them; now let them disappear. And remember one thing about worrying – that it has no beginning and no end. If you want to continue,\nyou can continue them forever; they are eternal. One worry creates ten more. Even the very solution that you bring in to end one worry will bring ten worries, so it goes on and on.\nThe very effort to solve a worry is to continue it. The moment one understands this viciousness of worry, one simply jumps out of it. It has not to be solved, it cannot be solved, but one can get out of it; one can grow out of it.\nLet this be your fee for sannyas: drop the worries! Give them to me – simply be free from this moment. Even if because of past habit they come sometimes, just say goodbye. Say ‘I’m finished; I am no more interested.’ Don’t get distracted by them, don’t even fight with them. If they come let them be there, remain indifferent, and within a few weeks you will find that they are coming less and less and less, and one day suddenly they are not there.\nThe day when one finds oneself without worries is a great day. One is really born that day and one has, for the first time, a glimpse of what life is. It is the smoke of worries that doesn’t allow you to see the flame of life.\nDeva Tapudana: divine sage... The sage is there although asleep, but he can be awakened. And it is very close to the morning; you have come in the right moment. A few people come who are in their deep slumber, in the middle of the night; to wake them will be painful. Mm? they are lost in beautiful dreams; it will hurt. But your morning is very close. You are already coming out of sleep, the night is disappearing, so it is not going to be painful. It is going to be very joyful! Something you would like to say to me?\n[The new sannyasin says: I feel as if I’m riding a horse and I’ve let go of the reins and the horse is just... ]\nYes, just let go the reins – don’t be worried, mm? Now I will take care of the horse! You just leave the reins, there is no need to control. Control creates conflict, control creates confusion and control creates duality. The very idea that you are the rider and that something like a horse is there, is a wrong idea. You are the horse and you are the rider, the horse is not separate from you. But religions have been teaching this nonsense: control the horse. In the very idea they divide you: your body becomes the horse and you become the rider. And naturally the ego feels very good that you are the rider. The body feels very bad so it goes on taking revenge. It will throw you into this ditch and into that ditch and will say to you, ‘Now see who is the rider and who is the horse!’ It is not right to make this division. You are the horse and you are the rider, so there is no need to control. Be more and more flowing, easy, relaxed.\nThe horse is already going towards god. It cannot go anywhere else because there is nowhere else to go. This whole world is his, so wherever you end up you will end up in him. Don’t be worried: one can go with absolute trust!\nDeva means divine, tarsa means thirst. The english word ‘thirst’ comes from tarsa; the root is the same: a thirst for the divine. And there is a difference between a thirst for the divine and a desire for the divine. A desire is of the mind; your totality is not involved in it. A thirst is total: your mind, your body, your heart, your soul, your all, is involved in it.\nA desire can be easily forgotten, the thirst cannot be forgotten. It bums there, it remains there: even when you are asleep it is there. You may do a thousand and one things but it will be there. A desire can easily be forgotten – you get involved in something else and you forget the desire, it disappears – because desire is only a very very tiny thing in the mind.\nThirst is all over: from the toes to the head it burns like a flame. When god is only a desire, one cannot reach. God demands you in your totality. When one becomes thirsty, only then does one start moving.\nPrem means love and tushir means a quiver in the heart – a quiver of love in the heart. And let the heart start quivering for love; it is almost a physical quiver. Whenever you see anything that reminds you of god let the heart dance for it. You see a rose flower: don’t be in a hurry, wait a little there. Say hello... Let your heart have a contact with the flower. It is raining: stand under the sky, dance with the rain and let your heart dance with the rains.\nWherever you can find an opportunity to thank god, to be grateful, don’t miss it. And there are millions of opportunities given every day. Each moment of life brings unaccountable gifts from god but we go on missing because our hearts have become so hard. They don’t quiver, they don’t welcome, and god can only enter from the heart. The heart has become like a rock. Melt it! And it melts only if you dance, sing, love.\nDon’t miss any opportunity to sing a song or dance a dance. Don’t miss any opportunity where you can be loving. Be loving! That’s what real prayer is. And this whole earth is the temple of god so wherever you are, you are moving on holy earth. Be full of awe, wonder, surprise. Let your eyes start feeling the mystery of existence.\nIt is incredible; it is just that we are blind. It is unbelievable, but we live behind a curtain, a thick curtain, and we go on missing. So become more open, be more nude with nature, and things will start happening!\nAnand means bliss, tarika means a small star – a small star of bliss. And get more and more in tune with the stars: whenever there are stars in the night and the night is clear, just lie down on the earth and look at the stars. If you feel attached to a certain star then concentrate on that. While concentrating on that think of yourself as being a small lake and that a star is reflected deep inside you. So see the star outside and see it reflected inside you. This will become your meditation, and great joy will arise out of it. Once you get in tune with it you can simply close your eyes and see that star, your star, but first you have to find it.\nIn the East they have a myth that everybody has a certain star. All those stars are not for everybody: everybody has a particular star. That myth is beautiful.\nAs far as meditation is concerned, you can find one star that belongs to you and to which you belong. There will arise a certain affinity between you and the star, because we are made of light as are the stars; we vibrate as light as do the stars. You can always find a star with which you simply feel in tune, which is on the same wavelength. That is your star; meditate over it.\nBy and by, allow it inside. Look at it then close your eyes and see it within. Open your eyes, look at it, close your eyes, see it within; soon you will find it is within you. Then whenever you close your\neyes you will find it there. And when you start feeling it inside, feel it just near the navel – below the navel, two inches. Deposit it there, go on depositing it, and soon you will feel great light arising inside you as if a star has already in reality burst forth. And it will not be only that you feel it, others will start feeling, it... that a certain kind of light has started surrounding your body, your face, has become your aura.…\nJust look for a few nights and you will be able to find your star.\n[A sannyasin says he has not been able to wear orange while in the West, and has hidden his mala inside. He doesn’t like people asking questions about it.]\nThat’s not good.… Let them ask! You can have a small written thing with you – just give it to them. If you don’t want to talk, if you don’t have time, just give them a handbill. A few of them will come to me so why not help them? They may be not just curious, they may be really interested.\nThis orange, this mala, is given to you for a specific purpose; you may not be alert of it. It has many implications in it: one is that, too – that people who are really seeking and searching may find a way through your orange, through your mala, towards me.\nI am not going anywhere, I simply sit in my room and I am not going to move out of my room, so how am I going to manage for thousands of people who need me and for whom I am waiting?\nThis is just a small strategy to bring all those people to me. Many are here who have just come by this way: they saw somebody in orange – they asked, ‘What is the matter?’ Maybe they asked simply out of curiosity. They were not even aware of their own unconscious desire and had not thought that asking was going to be risky... that by asking it their whole life might be changed and transformed. They have come here and now they are in orange.\nAnd secondly, I want my sannyasins to be completely free of the fear of public opinion; that is a cowardliness.\nAnd this orange and this mala constantly keep you alert. They do not allow you to lose yourself in sleep. Wherever you are going people will look, people will become attentive: what manner of man is coming? What has happened to this man? And when they are attentive, you are alert.\nPeople like to remain anonymous for a certain reason: that keeps you asleep. You remain a part of an anonymous crowd – you are nobody, mm? just part of the crowd. Nobody takes note of you so you need not take any note of yourself.\nThis is basically meant to create that situation. It is a device to constantly keep you arrowed from everywhere. You are never left so that you can relax and relapse into your sleep.\nThat’s not good; next time don’t do that. Be courageous, mm?\n[A sannyasin said he had left the encounter group on the sixth night because he felt mad:... and the only words that come to me now are madness and surrender.]\nRight! They are exactly the right words – and both are good! Both are perfectly good. And it is not madness; it is a higher kind of sanity that is going to happen to you. It is not the average kind that’s true; it is a higher kind of sanity. It looks mad... because you compare it with the ordinary, average mind; then it looks mad.\nPsychologists still go on thinking that jesus was neurotic. If you compare him with the average, normal mind, he is abnormal. And abnormal does not have a good connotation in the psychological world: it means mad, that something is wrong. Either you are below the normal, then you are abnormal, or you are above the normal; then too you are abnormal. And they don’t make any distinction between these two, totally different, kinds of things.\nSomething above the normal is going to happen – just allow it; that’s why madness and surrender. Just surrender; there is no need to be worried.\nAnd in the group also people felt something; they became afraid? They started thinking you are a witch or something?\nA witch means a wise woman; that is the real meaning of the word ‘witch’ It became condemned because of male chauvinism, otherwise ‘witch’ is a very very respectful word. It means ‘a wise woman’ – it means exactly what ‘buddha’ means – but it became condemned because of christians. They started witch-hunting and destroying women who were of some other dimension. They really destroyed one of the greatest possibilities of human growth. They stopped women from growing. All exceptional women were destroyed in the middle ages; only very ordinary women survived. It is one of the greatest crimes... but it happens.\nWhenever a woman starts becoming something exceptional, the man will become very much afraid because he cannot understand it. When a man becomes exceptional he can understand because the difference is only of quantity. But when a woman becomes abnormal or super-normal the man cannot understand at all because this is a totally different kind of energy – the female energy. He has no understanding about it; it is very dangerous. And man has always remained afraid of woman because woman is more intuitive. Intellect man can understand but intuition he cannot understand; it seems uncanny.\nPerfectly good. But don’t be worried that you are a witch: something good is going to happen! [An ashram therapist says he has a conflict between surrendering and trying to respect himself.]\nNo, you are creating an unnecessary problem. By surrendering for the first time you will gain respect for yourself. You have never respected yourself, you may think you have but you have not. And if you call it respect, it is not respect; it is something else. It is just an ego that you have been calling ‘self-respect’. By dropping that ego for the first time you will find something new arising in you.\n[A participant of the new anatta group said he found it boring.]\nBoring? That’s very good! That’s very good, that’s a good beginning. That shows you are still alive, that shows you are intelligent – because only man gets bored, buffaloes don’t! That’s a good indication!\n[The participant then says he went crazy three times and now he’s happy.]\nMm mm... that’s very good! Sometimes to go crazy is very good: it simply shows that one is not satisfied with the ordinary run of things so one wants to jump beyond the boundaries.\nAll good people are a little crazy... all rare people are freaks. Don’t be worried! Enjoy it here – you cannot find a more crazy place anywhere! Here even the craziest person looks very sane! Good!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2781","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_no_book_no_buddha_no_teaching_no_discipline/part16/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_no_book_no_buddha_no_teaching_no_discipline/>The No Book (No Buddha, No Teaching, No Discipline)</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">16</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2781 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_No_Book_No_Buddha_No_Teaching_No_Discipline/part16.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

thing in the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Thirst is all over: from the toes to the head it burns like a flame.
When god is only a desire, one cannot reach. God demands you in your
totality. When one becomes thirsty, only then does one start moving.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem means love and tushir means a quiver in the heart – a quiver of
love in the heart. And let the heart start quivering for love; it is
almost a physical quiver. Whenever you see anything that reminds you of
god let the heart dance for it. You see a rose flower: don’t be in a
hurry, wait a little there. Say hello... Let your heart have a contact
with the flower. It is raining: stand under the sky, dance with the rain
and let your heart dance with the rains.</p><p><br></p><p>Wherever you can find an opportunity to thank god, to be grateful,
don’t miss it. And there are millions of opportunities given every day.
Each moment of life brings unaccountable gifts from god but we go on
missing because our hearts have become so hard. They don’t quiver, they
don’t welcome, and god can only enter from the heart. The heart has
become like a rock. Melt it! And it melts only if you dance, sing,
love.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t miss any opportunity to sing a song or dance a dance. Don’t
miss any opportunity where you can be loving. Be loving! That’s what
real prayer is. And this whole earth is the temple of god so wherever
you are, you are moving on holy earth. Be full of awe, wonder, surprise.
Let your eyes start feeling the mystery of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>It is incredible; it is just that we are blind. It is unbelievable,
but we live behind a curtain, a thick curtain, and we go on missing. So
become more open, be more nude with nature, and things will start
happening!</p><p><br></p><p>Anand means bliss, tarika means a small star – a small star of bliss.
And get more and more in tune with the stars: whenever there are stars
in the night and the night is clear, just lie down on the earth and look
at the stars. If you feel attached to a certain star then concentrate on
that. While concentrating on that think of yourself as being a small
lake and that a star is reflected deep inside you. So see the star
outside and see it reflected inside you. This will become your
meditation, and great joy will arise out of it. Once you get in tune
with it you can simply close your eyes and see that star, your star, but
first you have to find it.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East they have a myth that everybody has a certain star. All
those stars are not for everybody: everybody has a particular star. That
myth is beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>As far as meditation is concerned, you can find one star that belongs
to you and to which you belong. There will arise a certain affinity
between you and the star, because we are made of light as are the stars;
we vibrate as light as do the stars. You can always find a star with
which you simply feel in tune, which is on the same wavelength. That is
your star; meditate over it.</p><p><br></p><p>By and by, allow it inside. Look at it then close your eyes and see
it within. Open your eyes, look at it, close your eyes, see it within;
soon you will find it is within you. Then whenever you close your</p><p>eyes you will find it there. And when you start feeling it inside,
feel it just near the navel – below the navel, two inches. Deposit it
there, go on depositing it, and soon you will feel great light arising
inside you as if a star has already in reality burst forth. And it will
not be only that you feel it, others will start feeling, it... that a
certain kind of light has started surrounding your body, your face, has
become your aura.…</p><p><br></p><p>Just look for a few nights and you will be able to find your
star.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says he has not been able to wear orange while in the
West, and has hidden his mala inside. He doesn’t like people asking
questions about it.]</p><p><br></p><p>That’s not good.… Let them ask! You can have a small written thing
with you – just give it to them. If you don’t want to talk, if you don’t
have time, just give them a handbill. A few of them will come to me so
why not help them? They may be not just curious, they may be really
interested.</p><p><br></p><p>This orange, this mala, is given to you for a specific purpose; you
may not be alert of it. It has many implications in it: one is that, too
– that people who are really seeking and searching may find a way
through your orange, through your mala, towards me.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not going anywhere, I simply sit in my room and I am not going
to move out of my room, so how am I going to manage for thousands of
people who need me and for whom I am waiting?</p><p><br></p><p>This is just a small strategy to bring all those people to me. Many
are here who have just come by this way: they saw somebody in orange –
they asked, ‘What is the matter?’ Maybe they asked simply out of
curiosity. They were not even aware of their own unconscious desire and
had not thought that asking was going to be risky... that by asking it
their whole life might be changed and transformed. They have come here
and now they are in orange.</p><p><br></p><p>And secondly, I want my sannyasins to be completely free of the fear
of public opinion; that is a cowardliness.</p><p><br></p><p>And this orange and this mala constantly keep you alert. They do not
allow you to lose yourself in sleep. Wherever you are going people will
look, people will become attentive: what manner of man is coming? What
has happened to this man? And when they are attentive, you are
alert.</p><p><br></p><p>People like to remain anonymous for a certain reason: that keeps you
asleep. You remain a part of an anonymous crowd – you are nobody, mm?
just part of the crowd. Nobody takes note of you so you need not take
any note of yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>This is basically meant to create that situation. It is a device to
constantly keep you arrowed from everywhere. You are never left so that
you can relax and relapse into your sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s not good; next time don’t do that. Be courageous, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin said he had left the encounter group on the sixth night
because he felt mad:... and the only words that come to me now are
madness and surrender.]</p><p>Right! They are exactly the right words – and both are good! Both are
perfectly good. And it is not madness; it is a higher kind of sanity
that is going to happen to you. It is not the average kind that’s true;
it is a higher kind of sanity. It looks mad... because you compare it
with the ordinary, average mind; then it looks mad.</p><p><br></p><p>Psychologists still go on thinking that jesus was neurotic. If you
compare him with the average, normal mind, he is abnormal. And abnormal
does not have a good connotation in the psychological world: it means
mad, that something is wrong. Either you are below the normal, then you
are abnormal, or you are above the normal; then too you are abnormal.
And they don’t make any distinction between these two, totally
different, kinds of things.</p><p><br></p><p>Something above the normal is going to happen – just allow it; that’s
why madness and surrender. Just surrender; there is no need to be
worried.</p><p><br></p><p>And in the group also people felt something; they became afraid? They
started thinking you are a witch or something?</p><p><br></p><p>A witch means a wise woman; that is the real meaning of the word
‘witch’ It became condemned because of male chauvinism, otherwise
‘witch’ is a very very respectful word. It means ‘a wise woman’ – it
means exactly what ‘buddha’ means – but it became condemned because of
christians. They started witch-hunting and destroying women who were of
some other dimension. They really destroyed one of the greatest
possibilities of human growth. They stopped women from growing. All
exceptional women were destroyed in the middle ages; only very ordinary
women survived. It is one of the greatest crimes... but it happens.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever a woman starts becoming something exceptional, the man will
become very much afraid because he cannot understand it. When a man
becomes exceptional he can understand because the difference is only of
quantity. But when a woman becomes abnormal or super-normal the man
cannot understand at all because this is a totally different kind of
energy – the female energy. He has no understanding about it; it is very
dangerous. And man has always remained afraid of woman because woman is
more intuitive. Intellect man can understand but intuition he cannot
understand; it seems uncanny.</p><p><br></p><p>Perfectly good. But don’t be worried that you are a witch: something
good is going to happen! [An ashram therapist says he has a conflict
between surrendering and trying to respect himself.]</p><p>No, you are creating an unnecessary problem. By surrendering for the
first time you will gain respect for yourself. You have never respected
yourself, you may think you have but you have not. And if you call it
respect, it is not respect; it is something else. It is just an ego that
you have been calling ‘self-respect’. By dropping that ego for the first
time you will find something new arising in you.</p><p><br></p><p>[A participant of the new anatta group said he found it boring.]</p><p><br></p><p>Boring? That’s very good! That’s very good, that’s a good beginning.
That shows you are still alive, that shows you are intelligent – because
only man gets bored, buffaloes don’t! That’s a good indication!</p><p>[The participant then says he went crazy three times and now he’s
happy.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm mm... that’s very good! Sometimes to go crazy is very good: it
simply shows that one is not satisfied with the ordinary run of things
so one wants to jump beyond the boundaries.</p><p><br></p><p>All good people are a little crazy... all rare people are freaks.
Don’t be worried! Enjoy it here – you cannot find a more crazy place
anywhere! Here even the craziest person looks very sane! Good!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

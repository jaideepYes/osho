She has a fever afterwards. Since the group it has been happening many times to her. Osho tells her to go into it while he checks her energy.]\nYou have stumbled upon a beautiful method of meditation. It has been used in a few christian communities in the past! It is of immense good. We were using it here too; we have changed it just now (the devavani meditation). But it is of immense help; don’t think anything wrong about it. Just start doing it every day at least for one hour.\nClose your door, sit in the middle of the room – exactly in the middle. It will be good if you are naked; be naked or have very loose clothes so the whole body is free, no constriction – and then start it. And enjoy it... Let it become almost orgasmic. You will have an orgasm through it. Your whole body will start moving, gestures will come, postures will come, and your body will have deep sexual orgasm through it. But don’t be afraid at all; you will be immensely benefited. Go on talking and really get animated; don’t be just lukewarm. Become passionate about it, talk in passion. And this gibberish will become your greatest meditation.\nBut when it happens on its own everybody thinks that something is wrong – that some spirit is there or some evil thing has happened. Has some evil possessed them or what? – because it is so... Yes, you are right! You say ‘cuckoo’; it is so cuckoo but it is so beautiful!\nIf you were not here and it had happened anywhere else they would have thought you had gone insane. But it is one of the most ancient methods. You must have heard about it.\nYes, you have heard about it; it is not a question of belief! My feeling is that in your past life you must have practised it so it has suddenly bubbled up. Here the atmosphere is of meditation, the vibe is of\nmeditation, and it happens to many people that whatsoever they have been doing in their past life comes back to consciousness. The milieu helps it to come back. You must have practised it and you must have practised it very deeply.\nJust get passionate about it and happy about it and let it be a celebration... and do it every day. Do it for three weeks and then report to me. Those three weeks will change you utterly. Mm? something great is going to happen through it!...\nDon’t worry! Even if it comes in the group allow it. And you have my approval that you are not cuckoo, mm? Good!\n[A visitor, who is leaving, says she is afraid of many things... the aeroplane, returning to the West, men smiling at her, her own anger... she is unsure whether to finish her teaching job.]\nI can understand your fearSomething is happening to you; that’s why the fear. Something that\nyou always wanted to happen is stirring. This is just the beginning, just glimpses of it, and you are afraid that back home you will lose track of it again. It is not really the aeroplane, it is not really the going back. It is that something joyful is happening to you or you have the hope that it is around the corner – and that you have never felt; for the first time you are feeling hopeful.\n[She says she was feeling joyful after a group, but when she heard a sudden noise, she became fearful again.]\nMm mm, that is there. That is there only because the joy has not happened, so you are afraid. Fear has many causes and for different people, different causes. For you, especially, the cause is that you are afraid to die; you are afraid that something may go wrong. And your joy has not happened yet. You have not lived your life yet, you have not bloomed yet. If something goes wrong – the hotel burns or the plane falls or is hijacked or something – and you have not attained anything, your life will be a sheer wastage.\nYour fear is coming because you are not feeling any fulfillment the way you are; the things that have happened up to now are not fulfilling. Your fear is coming because joy has not happened. Yes, there may have been moments, but those moments simply make you more thirsty for joy and nothing else. They create even more anxiety – that it is possible and it is not happening. Because you have seen glimpses. If you had not even seen those glimpses then there would have been no fear: you would have accepted that this is the way life is, there is no more to it. But you know that there is more to it. And you are afraid that something may be cut short, that you may lose track of it, that you will be no more in the body or will die or something else will happen.\nWhen a person attains to real joy he becomes completely unafraid of death – because there is nothing to be afraid of. He is fulfilled. He has sung his song, he has danced his dance, he has loved, he has been loved. There is fulfillment, there is contentment. If death comes it is perfectly okay; there is no fear. But when nothing has happened and the bud has not opened, naturally fear arises that if somebody comes and cuts the bud and the flower has been missed...\nYou can come back after three months, and then be here for a longer period. A long period will be helpful so that you can forget England completely and can move into things.\nDeva means divine, nimeesha means moment – divine moment. And a particular moment is called a divine moment – when one attains to one’s self, when one comes to know one’s self. That moment is called ‘divine moment’. the moment of realisation. That moment is not part of time at all; it is timeless. In fact to call it a moment is not right, but language is not adequate. It is a momentless moment; it is just the gap between two moments, just the small interval. One moment has passed and another is coming, and just in between – that small door. It is timeless... it is part of eternity.\nFrom that small door one enters into oneself. And I would like you, while you are away, to just wait for this moment. Just sit silently and do nothing; every day for at least forty minutes just sit silently. Close the doors, make the light very dim, a candle is perfectly good, and having a certain kind of fragrance will be helpful, whatsoever you like. Incense is good, but the same incense, and a very dim light, candlelight; it should be neither bright light nor dark. And sit relaxed, if it is not too cold, naked. If it is too cold then just have some loose thing thrown over your body. Just sit silently with closed eyes waiting for that moment, not doing anything at all.\nIf thoughts come, let them come, let them pass. No need to fight with them, no need to tell them to stop; remain indifferent, just a witness. And within these three months some day you will have a glimpse of that moment; then you will understand the meaning of your name.\nThis word ‘nimeesha’ is a very significant word. In english there is no synonymous word for it, that’s why I am translating it as ‘moment’. If you can do this meditation at exactly the same time and in the same room, that will be the best. If it is not possible then you can change the time or change the room, but first try to make it absolutely regular so that the body/mind, both are ready for it. It is really waiting for that time: your body is waiting, your mind is waiting, you are waiting.When all these three meet in a certain wavelength, then that moment happens.\nOne should not be hungry and one should not be too full. One should not be too tired, too sleepy; these things have to be taken care of. So if you find it is good in the morning, then in the morning. If by the evening you are too tired, sleepy, and you will fall asleep, then do it in the morning. If you feel that the evening is perfectly good, you are not tired, you can do it in the evening.\nAnd don’t be hungry, because when you are feeling hungry the consciousness goes into the stomach; it roams there. When you are too full, when you have eaten too much, one starts feeling sleepy; one feels like falling into unconsciousness. Take a shower and sit silently with a certain fragrance, with a certain light; just sit doing nothing, waiting for something to penetrate.\nIt comes just out of the blue. You cannot bring it, you cannot pull it, you cannot manage it. You cannot do anything about it: you can just be in a receptive mood. So whenever that receptivity happens, it comes. And once you have tasted that moment you know the way to Then any time you can fall into that wavelength. Again you can invite it and it will be coming.\nThat moment by and by starts growing, becomes bigger. bigger, bigger; a time comes when it starts overlapping your whole being.\nAnd don’t be afraid – just go, mm? We have a centre there.… So go to the centre... meet orange people, mm? Good!\n[A sannyasin says: In the last couple of groups I did, the general feedback I get is that I’m aloof and I act as if I’m above what’s happening... outside the group as well, I feel as if I’m only letting a very few people into my heart and with the great majority I’m very superficial.\nHe also says he has done many groups in the ashram. Osho checks his energy.]\nNothing to be worried about, not at all. Simply don’t be bothered about the feedback that you have been getting.\n[The group leader] is right – that you have a certain perceptivity, an intellectual understanding, and because of that understanding people will look superficial. But you don’t actually experience at the heart centre... but that is going to happen. Don’t make it a worry and don’t make it a problem.\nThis same perception that is in the intellect right now will slowly, slowly, seep into the heart. I cannot say that same thing to everybody but to you I am saying it – that this same perceptivity that is in the head right now, slowly, slowly, will get into your heart, because there is no barrier between the head and the heart.\nThere are people who have great barriers. When the barriers exist it is difficult; first the barriers have to be broken. You don’t have any barriers, any walls. It is true – your perception is in the intellect, but there is no wall so it will seep through; it will go automatically into the heart. You need not be worried at all, don’t think about this problem. And now there is no need to do any groups, mm? Just enjoy being here... meditate and just enjoy. And it is going to happen, mm? – some day listening in the talk in the morning it will happen! Good.Nothing to be worried about!\n[A sannyasin, who is leaving, says: I just have a very hard time surrendering totally. I feel my own strength and I like to rely on it, on who I am, and so I’ve always felt very much to rely on myself. It’s very hard for me to give up to someone else, in a lot of ways.]\nBut I’m not somebody else!...\nIt’s no problem. I’m your deepest being; there is no conflict. If you are really for yourself, surrender is simple – because I am not, in any way, standing against you and I am not in any way imposing any ideals on you. I am not giving you any programme of how you should be. I am just a support: whatsoever you want to be you can be. I am not even directing you to go to the north or to the east or to the west; wherever you are going I’m simply blessing you.\nSo I can understand: surrender is difficult and there are so many pseudo-gurus in the world that it is good that it is difficult. Otherwise you will surrender anywhere and that will be a sheer wastage of your time, your life energy.…\nBut with me there is no problem. The problem is not there because I am not standing against you in any way. I am absolutely for you, more than you are for yourself. If there is going to be any conflict between me and you, the conflict will be that I am more for you than you are. So the more you understand me, the easier it will become. It is only a question of time and understanding. But it is coming, it is happening.and there is no hurry either!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2264","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_no_book_no_buddha_no_teaching_no_discipline/part24/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_no_book_no_buddha_no_teaching_no_discipline/>The No Book (No Buddha, No Teaching, No Discipline)</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">24</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2264 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_No_Book_No_Buddha_No_Teaching_No_Discipline/part24.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part23>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

moment’. the moment of realisation. That moment is not part of time at
all; it is timeless. In fact to call it a moment is not right, but
language is not adequate. It is a momentless moment; it is just the gap
between two moments, just the small interval. One moment has passed and
another is coming, and just in between – that small door. It is
timeless... it is part of eternity.</p><p><br></p><p>From that small door one enters into oneself. And I would like you,
while you are away, to just wait for this moment. Just sit silently and
do nothing; every day for at least forty minutes just sit silently.
Close the doors, make the light very dim, a candle is perfectly good,
and having a certain kind of fragrance will be helpful, whatsoever you

candlelight; it should be neither bright light nor dark. And sit

no synonymous word for it, that’s why I am translating it as ‘moment’.
If you can do this meditation at exactly the same time and in the same
room, that will be the best. If it is not possible then you can change
the time or change the room, but first try to make it absolutely regular
so that the body/mind, both are ready for it. It is really waiting for

not tired, you can do it in the evening.</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t be hungry, because when you are feeling hungry the
consciousness goes into the stomach; it roams there. When you are too
full, when you have eaten too much, one starts feeling sleepy; one feels
like falling into unconsciousness. Take a shower and sit silently with a
certain fragrance, with a certain light; just sit doing nothing, waiting
for something to penetrate.</p><p><br></p><p>It comes just out of the blue. You cannot bring it, you cannot pull
it, you cannot manage it. You cannot do anything about it: you can just
be in a receptive mood. So whenever that receptivity happens, it comes.
And once you have tasted that moment you know the way to Then any time
you can fall into that wavelength. Again you can invite it and it will
be coming.</p><p><br></p><p>That moment by and by starts growing, becomes bigger. bigger, bigger;
a time comes when it starts overlapping your whole being.</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t be afraid – just go, mm? We have a centre there.… So go to
the centre... meet orange people, mm? Good!</p><p>[A sannyasin says: In the last couple of groups I did, the general
feedback I get is that I’m aloof and I act as if I’m above what’s
happening... outside the group as well, I feel as if I’m only letting a
very few people into my heart and with the great majority I’m very
superficial.</p><p><br></p><p>He also says he has done many groups in the ashram. Osho checks his
energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing to be worried about, not at all. Simply don’t be bothered
about the feedback that you have been getting.</p><p><br></p><p>[The group leader] is right – that you have a certain perceptivity,
an intellectual understanding, and because of that understanding people
will look superficial. But you don’t actually experience at the heart
centre... but that is going to happen. Don’t make it a worry and don’t
make it a problem.</p><p><br></p><p>This same perception that is in the intellect right now will slowly,
slowly, seep into the heart. I cannot say that same thing to everybody
but to you I am saying it – that this same perceptivity that is in the
head right now, slowly, slowly, will get into your heart, because there
is no barrier between the head and the heart.</p><p><br></p><p>There are people who have great barriers. When the barriers exist it
is difficult; first the barriers have to be broken. You don’t have any
barriers, any walls. It is true – your perception is in the intellect,
but there is no wall so it will seep through; it will go automatically
into the heart. You need not be worried at all, don’t think about this
problem. And now there is no need to do any groups, mm? Just enjoy being
here... meditate and just enjoy. And it is going to happen, mm? – some
day listening in the talk in the morning it will happen! Good.<span class=s4></span>Nothing to be worried about!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, who is leaving, says: I just have a very hard time
surrendering totally. I feel my own strength and I like to rely on it,
on who I am, and so I’ve always felt very much to rely on myself. It’s
very hard for me to give up to someone else, in a lot of ways.]</p><p><br></p><p>But I’m not somebody else!...</p><p><br></p><p>It’s no problem. I’m your deepest being; there is no conflict. If you
are really for yourself, surrender is simple – because I am not, in any
way, standing against you and I am not in any way imposing any ideals on
you. I am not giving you any programme of how you should be. I am just a
support: whatsoever you want to be you can be. I am not even directing
you to go to the north or to the east or to the west; wherever you are
going I’m simply blessing you.</p><p><br></p><p>So I can understand: surrender is difficult and there are so many
pseudo-gurus in the world that it is good that it is difficult.
Otherwise you will surrender anywhere and that will be a sheer wastage
of your time, your life energy.…</p><p><br></p><p>But with me there is no problem. The problem is not there because I
am not standing against you in any way. I am absolutely for you, more
than you are for yourself. If there is going to be any conflict between
me and you, the conflict will be that I am more for you than you are. So
the more you understand me, the easier it will become. It is only a
question of time and understanding. But it is coming, it is
happening.<span class=s4></span>and there is no hurry either!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part23>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

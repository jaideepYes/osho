Feel love for anybody and for everybody... for all, with no conditions.…\n... Shift from the intellectual to the world of feeling. Intellectuality is just rubbish. Words cannot fulfil, logic cannot satisfy. One can have beautiful philosophies but one remains ugly; those philosophies don’t help. The real question is not what to think but what to be, and that being comes from feeling. Through thinking only memory goes on growing: you don’t grow. Through feeling you grow... and that is the real growth. The growth of memory is just like a computer being fed. New information is being fed to the computer: it goes on growing. Memory is a bio-computer.\nNow biologists say that memory transplantation is possible. When a man dies his memory can be transplanted in a child; it is just a mechanical part. Sooner or later it is going to happen: when an albert einstein dies there is no need to lose his memory. His memory can be transplanted on a small child and the small child will know all that Albert Einstein used to know – without learning; he will simply know it.\nMemory is just mechanical. It can be separated from you. It can be transplanted, it will be transplanted. But real growth happens in you, and that is a totally different dimension of existence: it is not intellectual. And intellectuals are more or less stupid people, because this is stupidity – not to grow and just go on accumulating knowledge.\nIntelligence is totally different than intellect. This is intelligence – the idea coming to you that you should start feeling more. This is intelligence – that you should stop intellectualising and should move towards the heart more; this is intelligence.\n[To a newly arrived sannyasin Osho says:]\nBe here and enjoy. And don’t make it a work; it is a play. Let it be fun, don’t get serious about it, then things happen far more deeply, far more easily and faster. When you become serious and you want to force, you become so tense that it is not possible for anything to happen. Things happen only when you are non-tense: when you are non-tense incredible things happen! When you are tense your doors are closed; no light can enter, no breeze can enter. Then one starts feeling suffocated. That’s what people are feeling: they go on feeling suffocated but they don’t drop their defences and they don’t open their doors. They are so afraid of the fresh air, they have become so addicted to the stale air, and they go on recycling the same air again and again and again. Christians, Mohammedans, Hindus just go on recycling the same stale ideology. And they don’t see outside that god goes on creating continuously. Each moment something new is happening.\nGod has not stopped creating, as Christians say, after six days; he is still creating. But for them he has stopped because they have closed their eyes. They think that god created the world in six days and on the seventh day he rested; that’s not true. He has never rested: he cannot go on a holiday otherwise the whole universe will disappear! He cannot afford that!\nWhat really happened is that after six days christians closed their eyes and since then they have not opened them. Just be here and enjoy! Good.\n[A sannyasin, who is leaving, says: I wrote you a letter about your being a guide and then somehow you disappearing. Now I don’t have anything inside.]\nThat happens... that happens. It is part of the whole growth. Many times I will be there and many times I will disappear. It is not really I who is disappearing – it is you. Sometimes you are open and sometimes you become closed. When you become closed I disappear; when you become open you will find me there. I am always there; it just depends on you opening your eyes. And this is part of the human mind – that it cannot remain open for twenty-four hours or for a longer period of time; it has to close. It is just as the eyes blink.\nAnd the next time you see me, you will find me deeper in you. For you I may have disappeared but that is not true from my side; I am continuously working on you. Next time you will find me deeper, and each time that I disappear and come again, you will find me deeper. So nothing to be worried about.\nAnd that too is natural – that insight is sometimes there and sometimes there is great confusion and you are lost in mist. Then you don’t know who you are, you don’t know what you are doing and what is happening. This is part of the inner melting.\nWe exist on many layers. In zen they have the perfect saying for it. They say that in the beginning for the seeker mountains are mountains, rivers are rivers. In the middle mountains are no more mountains and rivers are no more rivers. In the end, again mountains are mountains and rivers are riversAnd this happens many times; it is not a single process.\nMan is like an onion, layers upon layers. When one layer is broken you will be confused. Soon you will settle on another layer, deeper, better, but again that layer has to be broken; then again you will be confused. This is going to happen many times, but each confusion will lead you to a better fusion. And one day, it happens that the whole onion has been peeled off and only emptiness is left in your hand.\nThat emptiness is the goal. That is where one becomes absolutely clear, and that never disappears: once it has happened, it has happened!\n... And continue to meditate. Even sometimes if you feel you are missing me, you need not worry. Just go on remembering me and continue to meditate. You are on the right track, that much I can promise to you.\nFor you it may not be clear where you are going, but it cannot be. For you it cannot be clear: you are moving from the known into the unknown. But slowly, slowly, you will become accustomed to this phenomenon that is happening to you, and you will be immensely joyful once you start feeling what is happening.\n[Osho gives sannyas to someone who practises archery.]\nVeet means beyond and chanchat means wavering – beyond wavering. Wavering means the mind: beyond wavering means gone beyond the mind. The mind is constantly wavering; ripples and waves – that’s what the mind is. When all ripples and waves disappear and the surface is silent, a different kind of being arises.\nAnd because you are an archer, that’s why I am giving you the name. The real archery starts only when the mind disappears. You cannot miss when the mind is not there. If your mind is continuously working, you can be technically right but not spiritually... and archery is a great technique of meditation.\nThe thing that I was telling you was not clear to you last time; I would like to say it again.You can\ngo on participating in competitions but you need not be competitive. You can simply aet as if you are a competitor. You can go on competing. The competition remains just on the surface; deep inside you are no more involved in it.\nThe inner involvement has to disappear. That will do both things: you can grow in archery and you will not be growing in ego. And finally, you have to become part of this family and teach archery to my sannyasins!\nRight ?\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1318","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_no_book_no_buddha_no_teaching_no_discipline/part18/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_no_book_no_buddha_no_teaching_no_discipline/>The No Book (No Buddha, No Teaching, No Discipline)</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">18</h1><div class=post-meta>7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1318 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_No_Book_No_Buddha_No_Teaching_No_Discipline/part18.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

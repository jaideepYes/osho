The mother says her daughter wants to ask Osho about dying. She wants Osho to tell her where everything goes when it dies.]\nThat’s very good.All children are interested in death; it is one of the natural curiosities. But rather\nthan answering them – because all answers will be false...\nSo never answer – just say that you don’t know, that we will die and we will see. And let that be a very very tacit understanding about all those things for which you don’t know the answers.\nWhen a child asks anything that you don’t know accept your ignorance. Never feel that acceptance of ignorance can be harmful; it never is. Parents always think that to accept that we don’t know will be harmful, our images will fall down before the child, but in fact just the opposite is the case. Sooner or later the child is going to find that you never knew and still you answered and you answered as if you knew. And the day it is recognised, the child will feel that you have been cheating, and then all respect disappears. Sooner or later the child is bound to find that the parents are as ignorant as anybody else, as powerless as anybody else, as groping in the dark as anybody elsebut they\npretended – and that pretension is very destructive. So whenever there is something you don’t know, say ‘I don’t know; I’m searching and seeking.’\nAnd death is one of those things about which nothing can be said except one thing – that we go back home, we go to the same place from where we have come. We don’t know either. We come from some unknown source and we go back to that unknown source. Death is the completion of the circle, but both ends, the beginning and the end, are hidden in mystery.\nIt is just as if a bird enters into a room from one window, flutters there for a few seconds and escapes from another window outside. We know only when the bird is inside the room. We don’t know from\nwhere it comes; we don’t know where it has gone. All that we know is that small time, that interval, when the bird was inside the room. We had seen the bird entering from one window and escaping from another window; we don’t know from where or to where.\nAnd this is the state of the whole of life. We see a child is born; the bird has entered – from where nobody knows. And then one day a person is dead; the bird has flown. And life is just between birth and death... a small passage.\nMake the child aware of the mystery. Rather than giving the answer it is better to make the child aware of the mysterious that’s all around, so the child starts feeling more awe, more wonder. Rather than giving a flat answer, it is better to create an enquiry. Help the child to be more curious, help the child to be more enquiring. Rather than giving the answer, make the child ask more questions. If the child’s heart becomes enquiring, that’s enough; that’s all parents can do for the child. Then the child will seek his or her own answers in his or her own way. Never give answers. That has been one of the most dangerous things that man has practised down the ages, the greatest calamity – that we are very arrogant when we give answers; we lose all humbleness. We forget that life remains unknown – something ‘x’. We live it and yet it remains unknown; we are in it and yet it remains unknown. Its unknowability is something that seems to be fundamental. We have known many things but the unknowability remains the same – untouched. Man has progressed in knowledge much, much is known every day; thousands of research papers go on being added to human knowledge, thousands of books go on being added. But still the fundamental remains the same. Before the fundamental we are humble and helpless.\nSo help her to feel the mystery more and more, mm?\nDeva means divine, paradha means mercury.… Mercury is a symbol of constant change, of aliveness, of flux, of liquidity... and these are all the qualities of a sannyasin. A sannyasin should be like mercury – never predictable, never confined by any structure.\nA sannyasin is absolute freedom. You cannot catch hold of it, you cannot keep it in your fist. There is no way to imprison that quality of consciousness; it is utter freedom.…\n[A new sannyasin tells Osho she is a salesman in the West.] Salesman? Start selling me too!...\nIt is needed!...\nIt is needed... many more people are hungry and they need it. It is very essential. Millions are missing it and they don’t know how to find; they don’t know where to move. In fact they don’t even know whether they need it or not.\nThe greatest problem is that man is unaware of his own basic need. If you know that you are hungry you will do something- to find something and you will find something or other, but if you are not even aware of your hunger you are going to die.\nJust think of a person who is hungry and by some mechanism is prevented from being aware of hunger. He is bound to starve himself and die, and he will never become aware that he could have\nlived if he had eaten. The hunger was there, he was there, but something was disconnected between the hunger and his mind. That’s what has happened between our need for god and our mind. A lingering suspicion is felt that something is missing... but what is it? By and by we start becoming adjusted to this feeling that something is missing. We tend to forget it because it is inconvenient and uncomfortable.\nIt is needed. You will become my walking salesman! That’s why I create sannyasins. The purpose is to send them to people who are hungry and who have forgotten completely that they are hungry. Just seeing you, seeing your joy and seeing your happiness, something will start stirring in their hearts. They will start enquiring, and once they enquire, they are caught. That very enquiry starts their journey. If we can help people just to enquire, that’s enough. Then they start groping. Something clicks and their minds start feeling their need; then they start knowing what is missing.\nIn the ancient times it was never so. Everybody was aware that god was missing and everybody was trying and searching and finding. Now people are still trying but they try something else – a good house, a good job, more money, this and that, and they think these are the things that are missing. Once they have these things there will be no problem. But they are living in a fool’s land.\nOnce these needs are fulfilled, suddenly for the first time there is the real problem. Now they have a good house, a good family, a secure job, money, everything. Suddenly everything falls flat and they recognise that the thing that was missing is still missing. It is missing even more so, because now all is there that they used to think would be a fulfillment. It is there and there is no fulfillment.\nNothing fails like success in the world: once you succeed you have come to the brink of failure. Those who are not successful can go on hoping but what is there for the successful to hope for? what is there for a Rockefeller to hope for? He has all that can be hoped for... more than he could have ever dreamed. Now what?\nThat’s why it happens that when people are a little richer they become religious... when a society becomes a little affluent. It is not just accidental that I have more Germans from Europe than anybody else – because they are now the richest people in Europe. It is not accidental. When there is richness, suddenly one starts feeling that richness won’t do; then the real need is felt.\nSo Germany needs many salesmen and many saleswomen, mm?\n[Osho explains the meaning of Prem Neelesh – god of the sky of love. And love has the quality of the sky – the same depth, the same infinity, unboundedness, the same purity]\nMillions of things happen but the sky remains unpolluted. Everything else becomes polluted – the air becomes polluted, the water becomes polluted. There is only one thing in existence which remains unpolluted – the sky. Because it is not; it is just a name for emptiness, a name for space, spaciousness. So clouds come and go, and the sky remains untouched.\nThat is also the quality of love. It is the only thing which is incorruptible, which no poison can destroy. And it is not that clouds don’t come – they come. Jealousy comes, that’s a cloud; possessiveness comes, that is a cloud. Anger comes, hatred comes – these are clouds. And sometimes the clouds are so many that you cannot even see the sky. It is completely covered but it is still there, and absolutely pure.\nSo always remember: the mind can become very much clouded by anger, but don’t be too worried about it. The sky behind remains there, always virgin; its virginity cannot be destroyed. Clouds come and go but there is something which never comes and never goes – that is the sky. And that’s what love is.\nThe experience of love is liberating and the experience of love gives you infinity – an experience, a taste, of infinity. So become more and more like the sky and like love. Be less and less identified with the clouds, with moods, whims, ideas, emotions, sentiment; become less and less identified. The day that one suddenly shifts one’s whole consciousness from the clouds to the sky is a day of great realisation.\nAnd both are there; it is only a question of emphasis. You can see both – both alternatives are always possible. So always seek the infinite, look for the infinite, and beware of the finite because the finite is only momentary. It is only tentative, it is arbitrary; it is accidental. The infinite is essential, and with the essential there is joy; with the accidental there is misery. If you get too attached to the accidental you will be in misery because the accidental cannot remain forever.\nThat which remains and remains and which there is no way to lose – that is what has to be searched for.\n[A sannyasin who is doing the encounter group says: A lot of fear coming up, a lot of anger coming up... just everything. It’s been very exciting.]\nMm mm, it is good when one starts becoming more alive. When one starts becoming more alive these things come up. They will go, they are not going to stay long; just don’t repress them again. Because we go on repressing, we go on carrying them as a substratum. Encounter must have broken some layer and things have started coming out. It is pus oozing out, but it has to be thrown out. Once one is free of pus, one is heathy and whole. Then life has a new beginning and is far more grounded.\nFar more positively one can start... because these are all negative emotions. If we go on carrying a lot of negative emotions underneath then our life remains negative. At the most we can pretend that we are not negative. We can smile and we can have a mask, but in fact you are fooling yourself because behind your smile you know there is no smile... and it hurts. When you say ‘I am okay’, you know you are not okay, and it hurts. When you say ‘Everything is beautiful’, you know that you are using a lie... just to save face. By and by one becomes very accustomed to these lies and then they don’t even hurt because one is not even conscious of what one is saying.\nAll those negativities go on moving in your blood, in your heartbeat, in your breathing, so whatsoever you do, even with good wishes, the consequences are not good. Even if you love your anger will affect your love – although it is hidden. You may not be angry with your friend, with your beloved, you may never show it, but it has its own way of coming in.\nAnything negative carried in the system makes life sad, a joyless affair. Then there is no excitement and no ecstasy; one simply lives a routine life, a middle-class life, a bourgeois life. Just because one cannot commit suicide one goes on living, but that is not enough reason to live.\nBy and by these negative emotions inside go on poisoning you and that becomes a slow suicide. By and by all aliveness disappears; one becomes frozen, cold... a stone. Stones don’t bloom and don’t flower and no fragrance ever comes. And life is worthwhile only when there is fragrance, when there is a kind of dance... when one is so happy that one can thank god... when the gratitude is real, not just a routine prayer. When the gratitude is out of the heart, one can really say ‘I am thankful because you gave me a chance to live and to see and to hear and to be.’\nOne great Indian poet, Rabindranath, was dying. He was a rare man – particularly in the east where people are very life-negative, where all the religions have been teaching life-negation, where people have been taught for centuries that life is a punishment, that because of your past karmas you are thrown into life as a punishment; when your punishment is over you will go back and then you will never come to life again.\nThis man, Rabindranath, was dying and a monk came to see him. He said, ‘Pray to god that he should not give you any more life. Pray, because this last prayer is meaningful.’\nRabindranath opened his eyes and said, ‘Stop all this nonsense! I am praying because he gave me such a beautiful life. I am asking that it be given to me again. I am so grateful! What nonsense are you talking? Life was immensely beautiful, and if there was misery it was because of me – I did not know how to live it; next time I will know better. If there was anything that was wrong, it was not because of life; it was just because of me. I was foolish, that’s why there was misery. Not that life is misery; it was just my foolishness. If I suffered, I suffered because of myself; that’s my responsibility. I cannot complain. At this moment when I am dying, how can I complain? How can I ask not to be born again? That will be the greatest complaint against god!’\n... And I love this man! This is how it should be!\nIf you have really lived a life of song and dance and celebration you will thank god from the very bottom of your heart. And this is the paradox – that those who can thank god deeply disappear: they don’t come again. This is the paradox. If somebody asks me I will say that this monk will have to come back and Rabindranath will not. There is no need: he has learned the lesson.\nHis being is transformed. That’s why he can unconditionally thank god and he can say, ‘If you send me a thousand and one times, I will still be thrilled. Your life is so beautiful, your gift was so immensely precious – how can I thank you? My debt is infinite; I cannot repay it.’\nThis man is not going to come back. There is no need for him because there is nothing else to learn. He has learned joy, he has learned celebration. He has learned thankfulness, he has learned gratitude – what else is there to learn? He has learned prayer.…\nSo let those negative emotions come up – don’t repress them. And come back again; whenever you can manage, come back!\n[A sannyasin who is leaving says that she has separated from her husband and has two children. The older one, aged twelve, is against anything new which she has done. They are staying with her parents and she does not know how to influence him to accept her sannyas.]\nNo, don’t try directly; don’t try. Just let him feel you. Just be loving and let him be the way he is. Let him see this difference – that since you came back from india you have become more loving – that’s all, and that will prepare him. Next time when you come, he himself will ask. Don’t you say anything: if he asks, then bring him. And once he is here things will change.\nJust meditate and be loving, and if he sometimes enquires about what it is, you can tell him but never in any way persuade him, never! Let him be persuaded of his own accord. He seems to be a strong child and the way to win a strong person is never to go direct, never, otherwise he will become more defensive and will shrink more and will become aggressive against you.\nJust be as if you are not interested in any way in converting him, then he will come; he will become interested. Then he will start enquiring. Take books, leave the books in his room so he can see. Play the tapes so if he wants to listen he can, but never in any way give him the hint that you are interested in his conversion, no; otherwise he will become very very stubborn and can create trouble. My feeling is that if you are a little aware and without any interference on your part, he will relax. And it is good that he should be helped to relax, because that will become his whole life’s pattern.\nIf he is only twelve... And these are the most important days of his life. If he does not change before fourteen then that will remain his style of life. Once the child’s sexuality has become mature then things become difficult to change. So whatsoever he is at the time of sexual maturity he will remain; one tends to remain that.\nPeople’s mental age remains near about fourteen. They never grow beyond that, very few grow beyond that. The body goes on growing; the mind stops. For all practical purposes nature no more helps you to grow. Nature’s purpose is fulfilled by the time a child is ready biologically to produce; nature’s interest is only in that. Once the child is ready to give birth to another child, nature is no more interested; nature’s work is done. Now, if you want to grow you will have to go on your own.\nAfter the age of fourteen if somebody grows it is an individual growth, it is a spiritual growth. Up to fourteen it is biological growth... but millions of people remain near about fourteen. They never take on any other growth beyond that which nature gives them; they are simply stuck there.\nSo this is a very pregnant time for the child. Simply be non-interfering. It will be difficult for you, but if you love the child then become absolutely non-interfering. Yes, make everything available so if he wants to he can use it. But don’t even hint. If he feels that you will be happy by his coming to india, he will never come. If he feels it is his happiness to come – you are not concerned at all, you don’t care – then he will become interested.\nOne has to be very very intelligent with children because they are intelligent people. So, just be loving, be helpful, and wait. My feeling is that he will come. I will start working on him through you!\n[A sannyasin who has completed some groups, says she has started losing, misplacing, her belongings... ]\nIt must be that you have just become too happy! It happens... because to remember things one needs a different kind of consciousness. When you become a little happier then you have a different kind of consciousness; you are no more interested in things as you were before. Money does not\nmatter too much when you are happy; when you are miserable it is everything. So when one is unhappy it is very difficult to lose money; one remembers perfectly. But when one is happy one can lose; one tends to forget the non-essential. It happens to many people – this is not accidental. Mm ? when you are feeling very floating, happy, joyous, you tend to lose your materialist’s consciousness. That is a materialist’s consciousness that keeps you alert about where your moneybag is and where your passport is.\nIt is a good indication.… You will have to learn a new kind of awareness, non-materialistic. Not that you are concerned with money and that’s why you remember it, no. That is not the right reason to remember it, but one has to remember everything that one is doing. Just as part of training, a discipline for awareness you will have to learn that. Do you follow me? If you are too money-minded, you need not be attentive; you go on remembering money.\nIt happens sometimes that even in sleep a money-minded person goes on remembering his money. It is very difficult, even when he is asleep, to take his money out of his pocket; he will immediately wake up. So this is one kind of attentiveness that is because we are too much concerned with the money, with this and that.\nOnce you start becoming a different kind of person this awareness will disappear. You will have to learn another kind of attentiveness. One has to learn to be attentive about everything – not because everything is valuable but because attentiveness is valuable. Then the shift has to change from matter to consciousness.\nSo now you have to be alert. Not that it is a passport and if it is lost there will be trouble, no, but because you are not to lose any opportunity to be alert; whether it is a passport or anything else, that doesn’t matter. Whether it is money or an ordinary paper doesn’t matter, but you have to be alert. Alertness has to be there; that you will have to learn.\nAnd that happens to many people: the first kind of awareness disappears; they have to learn a second kind of awareness.

<a href=part27>Next ></a></p><p><span id=bookmark25>‌</span>CHAPTER <span class=s3>26</span></p><p><br></p><p>26 August 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho gives a three-year-old girl sannyas. The mother says her
daughter wants to ask Osho about dying. She wants Osho to tell her where
everything goes when it dies.]</p><p><br></p><p>That’s very good.<span class=s4></span>All children are interested
in death; it is one of the natural curiosities. But rather</p><p>than answering them – because all answers will be false...</p><p><br></p><p>So never answer – just say that you don’t know, that we will die and
we will see. And let that be a very very tacit understanding about all
those things for which you don’t know the answers.</p><p><br></p><p>When a child asks anything that you don’t know accept your ignorance.
Never feel that acceptance of ignorance can be harmful; it never is.
Parents always think that to accept that we don’t know will be harmful,
our images will fall down before the child, but in fact just the
opposite is the case. Sooner or later the child is going to find that
you never knew and still you answered and you answered as if you knew.
And the day it is recognised, the child will feel that you have been
cheating, and then all respect disappears. Sooner or later the child is
bound to find that the parents are as ignorant as anybody else, as
powerless as anybody else, as groping in the dark as anybody else<span class=s4></span>but they</p><p>pretended – and that pretension is very destructive. So whenever
there is something you don’t know, say ‘I don’t know; I’m searching and
seeking.’</p><p><br></p><p>And death is one of those things about which nothing can be said
except one thing – that we go back home, we go to the same place from
where we have come. We don’t know either. We come from some unknown
source and we go back to that unknown source. Death is the completion of
the circle, but both ends, the beginning and the end, are hidden in
mystery.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just as if a bird enters into a room from one window, flutters
there for a few seconds and escapes from another window outside. We know
only when the bird is inside the room. We don’t know from</p><p>where it comes; we don’t know where it has gone. All that we know is
that small time, that interval, when the bird was inside the room. We
had seen the bird entering from one window and escaping from another
window; we don’t know from where or to where.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the state of the whole of life. We see a child is born;
the bird has entered – from where nobody knows. And then one day a
person is dead; the bird has flown. And life is just between birth and
death... a small passage.</p><p><br></p><p>Make the child aware of the mystery. Rather than giving the answer it
is better to make the child aware of the mysterious that’s all around,
so the child starts feeling more awe, more wonder. Rather than giving a
flat answer, it is better to create an enquiry. Help the child to be
more curious, help the child to be more enquiring. Rather than giving
the answer, make the child ask more questions. If the child’s heart
becomes enquiring, that’s enough; that’s all parents can do for the
child. Then the child will seek his or her own answers in his or her own
way. Never give answers. That has been one of the most dangerous things
that man has practised down the ages, the greatest calamity – that we
are very arrogant when we give answers; we lose all humbleness. We
forget that life remains unknown – something ‘x’. We live it and yet it
remains unknown; we are in it and yet it remains unknown. Its
unknowability is something that seems to be fundamental. We have known
many things but the unknowability remains the same – untouched. Man has
progressed in knowledge much, much is known every day; thousands of
research papers go on being added to human knowledge, thousands of books
go on being added. But still the fundamental remains the same. Before
the fundamental we are humble and helpless.</p><p><br></p><p>So help her to feel the mystery more and more, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine, paradha means mercury.… Mercury is a symbol of
constant change, of aliveness, of flux, of liquidity... and these are
all the qualities of a sannyasin. A sannyasin should be like mercury –
never predictable, never confined by any structure.</p><p><br></p><p>A sannyasin is absolute freedom. You cannot catch hold of it, you
cannot keep it in your fist. There is no way to imprison that quality of
consciousness; it is utter freedom.…</p><p><br></p><p>[A new sannyasin tells Osho she is a salesman in the West.] Salesman?
Start selling me too!...</p><p>It is needed!...</p><p><br></p><p>It is needed... many more people are hungry and they need it. It is
very essential. Millions are missing it and they don’t know how to find;
they don’t know where to move. In fact they don’t even know whether they
need it or not.</p><p><br></p><p>The greatest problem is that man is unaware of his own basic need. If
you know that you are hungry you will do something- to find something
and you will find something or other, but if you are not even aware of
your hunger you are going to die.</p><p><br></p><p>Just think of a person who is hungry and by some mechanism is
prevented from being aware of hunger. He is bound to starve himself and
die, and he will never become aware that he could have</p><p>lived if he had eaten. The hunger was there, he was there, but
something was disconnected between the hunger and his mind. That’s what
has happened between our need for god and our mind. A lingering
suspicion is felt that something is missing... but what is it? By and by
we start becoming adjusted to this feeling that something is missing. We
tend to forget it because it is inconvenient and uncomfortable.</p><p><br></p><p>It is needed. You will become my walking salesman! That’s why I
create sannyasins. The purpose is to send them to people who are hungry
and who have forgotten completely that they are hungry. Just seeing you,
seeing your joy and seeing your happiness, something will start stirring
in their hearts. They will start enquiring, and once they enquire, they
are caught. That very enquiry starts their journey. If we can help
people just to enquire, that’s enough. Then they start groping.
Something clicks and their minds start feeling their need; then they
start knowing what is missing.</p><p><br></p><p>In the ancient times it was never so. Everybody was aware that god
was missing and everybody was trying and searching and finding. Now
people are still trying but they try something else – a good house, a
good job, more money, this and that, and they think these are the things
that are missing. Once they have these things there will be no problem.
But they are living in a fool’s land.</p><p><br></p><p>Once these needs are fulfilled, suddenly for the first time there is
the real problem. Now they have a good house, a good family, a secure
job, money, everything. Suddenly everything falls flat and they
recognise that the thing that was missing is still missing. It is
missing even more so, because now all is there that they used to think
would be a fulfillment. It is there and there is no fulfillment.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing fails like success in the world: once you succeed you have
come to the brink of failure. Those who are not successful can go on
hoping but what is there for the successful to hope for? what is there
for a Rockefeller to hope for? He has all that can be hoped for... more
than he could have ever dreamed. Now what?</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why it happens that when people are a little richer they
become religious... when a society becomes a little affluent. It is not
just accidental that I have more Germans from Europe than anybody else –
because they are now the richest people in Europe. It is not accidental.
When there is richness, suddenly one starts feeling that richness won’t
do; then the real need is felt.</p><p><br></p><p>So Germany needs many salesmen and many saleswomen, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho explains the meaning of Prem Neelesh – god of the sky of love.
And love has the quality of the sky – the same depth, the same infinity,
unboundedness, the same purity<span class=s4></span>]</p><p><br></p><p>Millions of things happen but the sky remains unpolluted. Everything
else becomes polluted – the air becomes polluted, the water becomes
polluted. There is only one thing in existence which remains unpolluted
– the sky. Because it is not; it is just a name for emptiness, a name
for space, spaciousness. So clouds come and go, and the sky remains
untouched.</p><p><br></p><p>That is also the quality of love. It is the only thing which is
incorruptible, which no poison can destroy. And it is not that clouds
don’t come – they come. Jealousy comes, that’s a cloud; possessiveness
comes, that is a cloud. Anger comes, hatred comes – these are clouds.
And sometimes the clouds are so many that you cannot even see the sky.
It is completely covered but it is still there, and absolutely pure.</p><p>So always remember: the mind can become very much clouded by anger,
but don’t be too worried about it. The sky behind remains there, always
virgin; its virginity cannot be destroyed. Clouds come and go but there
is something which never comes and never goes – that is the sky. And
that’s what love is.</p><p><br></p><p>The experience of love is liberating and the experience of love gives
you infinity – an experience, a taste, of infinity. So become more and
more like the sky and like love. Be less and less identified with the
clouds, with moods, whims, ideas, emotions, sentiment; become less and
less identified. The day that one suddenly shifts one’s whole
consciousness from the clouds to the sky is a day of great
realisation.</p><p><br></p><p>And both are there; it is only a question of emphasis. You can see
both – both alternatives are always possible. So always seek the
infinite, look for the infinite, and beware of the finite because the
finite is only momentary. It is only tentative, it is arbitrary; it is
accidental. The infinite is essential, and with the essential there is
joy; with the accidental there is misery. If you get too attached to the
accidental you will be in misery because the accidental cannot remain
forever.</p><p><br></p><p>That which remains and remains and which there is no way to lose –
that is what has to be searched for.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin who is doing the encounter group says: A lot of fear
coming up, a lot of anger coming up... just everything. It’s been very
exciting.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm mm, it is good when one starts becoming more alive. When one
starts becoming more alive these things come up. They will go, they are
not going to stay long; just don’t repress them again. Because we go on
repressing, we go on carrying them as a substratum. Encounter must have
broken some layer and things have started coming out. It is pus oozing
out, but it has to be thrown out. Once one is free of pus, one is heathy
and whole. Then life has a new beginning and is far more grounded.</p><p><br></p><p>Far more positively one can start... because these are all negative
emotions. If we go on carrying a lot of negative emotions underneath
then our life remains negative. At the most we can pretend that we are
not negative. We can smile and we can have a mask, but in fact you are
fooling yourself because behind your smile you know there is no smile...
and it hurts. When you say ‘I am okay’, you know you are not okay, and
it hurts. When you say ‘Everything is beautiful’, you know that you are
using a lie... just to save face. By and by one becomes very accustomed
to these lies and then they don’t even hurt because one is not even
conscious of what one is saying.</p><p><br></p><p>All those negativities go on moving in your blood, in your heartbeat,
in your breathing, so whatsoever you do, even with good wishes, the
consequences are not good. Even if you love your anger will affect your
love – although it is hidden. You may not be angry with your friend,
with your beloved, you may never show it, but it has its own way of
coming in.</p><p><br></p><p>Anything negative carried in the system makes life sad, a joyless
affair. Then there is no excitement and no ecstasy; one simply lives a
routine life, a middle-class life, a bourgeois life. Just because one
cannot commit suicide one goes on living, but that is not enough reason
to live.</p><p>By and by these negative emotions inside go on poisoning you and that
becomes a slow suicide. By and by all aliveness disappears; one becomes
frozen, cold... a stone. Stones don’t bloom and don’t flower and no
fragrance ever comes. And life is worthwhile only when there is
fragrance, when there is a kind of dance... when one is so happy that
one can thank god... when the gratitude is real, not just a routine
prayer. When the gratitude is out of the heart, one can really say ‘I am
thankful because you gave me a chance to live and to see and to hear and
to be.’</p><p><br></p><p>One great Indian poet, Rabindranath, was dying. He was a rare man –
particularly in the east where people are very life-negative, where all
the religions have been teaching life-negation, where people have been
taught for centuries that life is a punishment, that because of your
past karmas you are thrown into life as a punishment; when your
punishment is over you will go back and then you will never come to life
again.</p><p><br></p><p>This man, Rabindranath, was dying and a monk came to see him. He
said, ‘Pray to god that he should not give you any more life. Pray,
because this last prayer is meaningful.’</p><p><br></p><p>Rabindranath opened his eyes and said, ‘Stop all this nonsense! I am
praying because he gave me such a beautiful life. I am asking that it be
given to me again. I am so grateful! What nonsense are you talking? Life
was immensely beautiful, and if there was misery it was because of me –
I did not know how to live it; next time I will know better. If there
was anything that was wrong, it was not because of life; it was just
because of me. I was foolish, that’s why there was misery. Not that life
is misery; it was just my foolishness. If I suffered, I suffered because
of myself; that’s my responsibility. I cannot complain. At this moment
when I am dying, how can I complain? How can I ask not to be born again?
That will be the greatest complaint against god!’</p><p><br></p><p>... And I love this man! This is how it should be!</p><p><br></p><p>If you have really lived a life of song and dance and celebration you
will thank god from the very bottom of your heart. And this is the
paradox – that those who can thank god deeply disappear: they don’t come
again. This is the paradox. If somebody asks me I will say that this
monk will have to come back and Rabindranath will not. There is no need:
he has learned the lesson.</p><p><br></p><p>His being is transformed. That’s why he can unconditionally thank god
and he can say, ‘If you send me a thousand and one times, I will still
be thrilled. Your life is so beautiful, your gift was so immensely
precious – how can I thank you? My debt is infinite; I cannot repay
it.’</p><p><br></p><p>This man is not going to come back. There is no need for him because
there is nothing else to learn. He has learned joy, he has learned
celebration. He has learned thankfulness, he has learned gratitude –
what else is there to learn? He has learned prayer.…</p><p><br></p><p>So let those negative emotions come up – don’t repress them. And come
back again; whenever you can manage, come back!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin who is leaving says that she has separated from her
husband and has two children. The older one, aged twelve, is against
anything new which she has done. They are staying with her parents and
she does not know how to influence him to accept her sannyas.]</p><p>No, don’t try directly; don’t try. Just let him feel you. Just be
loving and let him be the way he is. Let him see this difference – that
since you came back from india you have become more loving – that’s all,
and that will prepare him. Next time when you come, he himself will ask.
Don’t you say anything: if he asks, then bring him. And once he is here
things will change.</p><p><br></p><p>Just meditate and be loving, and if he sometimes enquires about what
it is, you can tell him but never in any way persuade him, never! Let
him be persuaded of his own accord. He seems to be a strong child and
the way to win a strong person is never to go direct, never, otherwise
he will become more defensive and will shrink more and will become
aggressive against you.</p><p><br></p><p>Just be as if you are not interested in any way in converting him,
then he will come; he will become interested. Then he will start
enquiring. Take books, leave the books in his room so he can see. Play
the tapes so if he wants to listen he can, but never in any way give him
the hint that you are interested in his conversion, no; otherwise he
will become very very stubborn and can create trouble. My feeling is
that if you are a little aware and without any interference on your
part, he will relax. And it is good that he should be helped to relax,
because that will become his whole life’s pattern.</p><p><br></p><p>If he is only twelve... And these are the most important days of his
life. If he does not change before fourteen then that will remain his
style of life. Once the child’s sexuality has become mature then things
become difficult to change. So whatsoever he is at the time of sexual
maturity he will remain; one tends to remain that.</p><p><br></p><p>People’s mental age remains near about fourteen. They never grow
beyond that, very few grow beyond that. The body goes on growing; the
mind stops. For all practical purposes nature no more helps you to grow.
Nature’s purpose is fulfilled by the time a child is ready biologically
to produce; nature’s interest is only in that. Once the child is ready
to give birth to another child, nature is no more interested; nature’s
work is done. Now, if you want to grow you will have to go on your
own.</p><p><br></p><p>After the age of fourteen if somebody grows it is an individual
growth, it is a spiritual growth. Up to fourteen it is biological
growth... but millions of people remain near about fourteen. They never
take on any other growth beyond that which nature gives them; they are
simply stuck there.</p><p><br></p><p>So this is a very pregnant time for the child. Simply be
non-interfering. It will be difficult for you, but if you love the child
then become absolutely non-interfering. Yes, make everything available
so if he wants to he can use it. But don’t even hint. If he feels that
you will be happy by his coming to india, he will never come. If he
feels it is his happiness to come – you are not concerned at all, you
don’t care – then he will become interested.</p><p><br></p><p>One has to be very very intelligent with children because they are
intelligent people. So, just be loving, be helpful, and wait. My feeling
is that he will come. I will start working on him through you!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin who has completed some groups, says she has started
losing, misplacing, her belongings... ]</p><p><br></p><p>It must be that you have just become too happy! It happens... because
to remember things one needs a different kind of consciousness. When you
become a little happier then you have a different kind of consciousness;
you are no more interested in things as you were before. Money does
not</p><p>matter too much when you are happy; when you are miserable it is
everything. So when one is unhappy it is very difficult to lose money;
one remembers perfectly. But when one is happy one can lose; one tends
to forget the non-essential. It happens to many people – this is not
accidental. Mm ? when you are feeling very floating, happy, joyous, you
tend to lose your materialist’s consciousness. That is a materialist’s
consciousness that keeps you alert about where your moneybag is and
where your passport is.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a good indication.… You will have to learn a new kind of
awareness, non-materialistic. Not that you are concerned with money and
that’s why you remember it, no. That is not the right reason to remember
it, but one has to remember everything that one is doing. Just as part
of training, a discipline for awareness you will have to learn that. Do
you follow me? If you are too money-minded, you need not be attentive;
you go on remembering money.</p><p><br></p><p>It happens sometimes that even in sleep a money-minded person goes on
remembering his money. It is very difficult, even when he is asleep, to
take his money out of his pocket; he will immediately wake up. So this
is one kind of attentiveness that is because we are too much concerned
with the money, with this and that.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you start becoming a different kind of person this awareness
will disappear. You will have to learn another kind of attentiveness.
One has to learn to be attentive about everything – not because
everything is valuable but because attentiveness is valuable. Then the
shift has to change from matter to consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>So now you have to be alert. Not that it is a passport and if it is
lost there will be trouble, no, but because you are not to lose any
opportunity to be alert; whether it is a passport or anything else, that
doesn’t matter. Whether it is money or an ordinary paper doesn’t matter,
but you have to be alert. Alertness has to be there; that you will have
to learn.</p><p><br></p><p>And that happens to many people: the first kind of awareness
disappears; they have to learn a second kind of awareness. In the gap
there will be a little trouble, mm? so don’t carry too much money with
you! Only carry things that you can afford to lose... and the remaining,
[ashram] can take care of, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part25>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

The man explains they have to travel on separate days because the wife had come to poona after him.]\nMm mm, separately?...\nThat’s very good... that’s very good! We come separately and we go separately, and all our meetings are just on the way, mm? One should remember it – that we are strangers – and one should never take the other for granted; that destroys all love. She is a stranger to you as you are a stranger to her. You have come separately and you will be going separately and you are growing separately.\nAloneness is utter; there is no way to be together with anybody. Even when we are together, we are alone. The deepest core of our being remains private, we cannot share it. Even if we want to, we cannot; it is simply not possible. We can overlap each other’s boundaries but the centres still remain separate. We can penetrate each other’s bodies and minds but our souls remain absolutely untouched.\nAnd if this is remembered many ugly phenomena can be avoided. One of them is taking the other for granted. We start doing that: it happens unconsciously. If you are living with a woman or a man for a few days, by and by you start taking the other for granted. You think you know the other, and the moment you think you know, love is hindered; a great obstacle has arisen. Knowledge is very very antagonistic to love, so remain strangers and remember perfectly well – never for a single moment forget it – that you are alone.\nIn love we don’t come together, in love only two lonelinesses come close. And it is beautiful that you remain alone: the other cannot really possess you and you cannot possess the other. You cannot become property and you cannot make the other property; the other’s freedom remains intact. We\nmay not remember it, we may tend to forget it, but that is dangerous. One should remember it, one should never forget it. Love together but with the full awareness that you are alone, and then there will be great compassion for the other... because the other is also alone.\nThe other is also groping in the dark as you are; the other is also searching and seeking as you are, and nobody is perfect. Then you don’t expect and you don’t have any ideals that the other should fulfill. Then you are always careful about the other’s aloneness: you don’t try to occupy the other’s aloneness. You remain careful when the other wants to be alone: you leave the other alone because you know the sacredness of aloneness.\nOtherwise lovers start interfering, lovers start trespassing. (to the husband) And if she wants to be alone, you will feel hurt; that is not love. If you want to be alone she feels hurt; that is not love. If you want to be alone, if she loves you, when you become aware that you want to be alone, even before that, she will become aware that you want to be alone and she will leave you.\nOne has to respect the other’s aloneness, because that is the other’s soul. And when lovers respect each other’s aloneness, love starts becoming spiritual; it is no more physical. The physical dimension may be there but now it is no more only that: something deeper, something greater, something higher starts descending.\nSo good – that’s true: you come alone, you go alone.\n[The wife asks what to do in the West... she loves making things: spinning and weaving.] That’s very good, mm? Spinning is very good, weaving is very good. Make it meditative. That’s very good – to do anything that is creative is very good and very helpful to growth.\nWe come closer to the creator when we become creators. If you create something you are close to god – whatsoever it is: a poetry, a poem, a chair. If you create something, in those moments of creating it you are very close to god. In fact when you are completely lost in your work you are not there – only god is there, because only god creates; how can man create?\nThat’s why in India particularly in the ancient days... We don’t know who has written the vedas. We don’t know who has written the Upanishads: it is one of the most beautiful scriptures of the world but we don’t know who has written it because the writers have not left even their names and signatures. The idea was that they were not – only god had been speaking through them, so who were they to sign it for god? They were nobody: they effaced themselves completely.\nThousands of poets must have composed the Vedas, it is not one man’s work, but nobody has left his name just because of this understanding – that whenever something is really created it is god who creates.\nWhen you create something then it is at the most a production, not a creation; you become a producer. You can become a producer but you cannot become a creator... and to become a creator is totally different to being a producer. A producer functions through the ego and the creator functions through no-ego.\nContinue to do your things and get deeper into them, and next time you come you will be able to move more deeply here, mm? Continue to meditate! Keep this with you (Osho passes them both boxes and touches their heads).\n[A sannyasin who is leaving to do a year’s army service says: When I was doing the ‘Who am I?’ I had some very nice moments. Maybe I should do it more deeply or should I just do it spontaneously when I remember?]\nTry to do it, and when it happens spontaneously then go into it also, but make it a point to devote at least one hour every day to it. Both things are to be done: for one hour make it a regular practice to do it, whether you feel like or not, and then if sometimes you feel like doing it for other than that one hour, you can.\nAnd this has to be understood – that real meditations always happen spontaneously, but those spontaneous moments come only if you practise, otherwise they don’t come. In practising you will not find those great moments coming, so don’t be worried about that; don’t think that nothing is happening. In those moments when you are practising nothing may happen; nothing to be worried about. But it will create in you a kind of energy that will explode sometimes spontaneously, and then something will happen: something really deep will happen.\nIf you think that now there is no need for this practise – you can wait for the spontaneous moment, those spontaneous moments will not come or they will come less and less and by and by they will disappear. So continue both, mm?\n... Finish the army, mm? and convert a few army people! I send my people everywhere to convert! And that one year will be very good to meditate... and help others to meditate. Good... good!\n[A new sannyasin says: I surrender!]\nI know; you have said it without saying it. When the surrender is there, it is there; it is immediately communicated. When it is not there, you can say, but just by saying it doesn’t show the reality. When it is there it vibrates. It is the deepest kind of love: every gesture, every move, says it. It is good to express it in language but language remains a secondary expression when it is there. When it is not there then language is the only expression, and language is a great method of falsifying.\nPeople have become falsified so much that if you say to them that you love them, only then will they understand; they understand only language. If you don’t say you love them, you can go on loving for years and they will not understand. And even if you don’t love and you say you love them, they will think you love. They will not look into your eyes, they will not look into your face and they will not look into your being. That is almost non-existential for people.\nPeople live in language, so whatsoever is said is believed. Whatsoever people read they believe. A printed word creates great belief in them. So there are people like dale carnegie who suggest that even if you don’t love your wife, go on repeating again and again that you love her and she will believe it. Dale carnegie is one of the prophets in america; the sale of his books is only second to that of the bible. This shows how people have become completely lost to reality, as if there is only one reality – the word. You have said it without saying it. It is there!\n[Deva Smrati – divine remembrance. Whenever you have time, Osho is saying, just remember – remember the beauty of the whole, the celebration that goes on continuously. When you see the sun, see the light of god; that will become a remembrance. When you see the moon, see god. When you are with people, don’t just see their surfaces, look into their depth. Look into their eyes and you will find god. Soon you will find god everywhere, throbbing, breathing, living... all that lives is god. Then slowly, slowly, one becomes so attuned that there is no need to even remember; one simply knows it is so. This is what sufis call zikr. That is their only method – to continuously remember god.]\nOnce it happened that a sufi went to a western country. It was his first day in the hotel. He asked for water and then thanked god and tears started flowing from his eyes. He drank the water and thanked again.\nA few people who were just sitting around the table started ridiculing him about what he was doing. They started laughing at him, and laughingly they asked, ‘Is it done by everybody in your country?’ The sufi said, ‘Except for the pigs, everybody does it.’\nA real man is constantly remembering god. In fact a man is different from animals only because he remembers god and animals cannot. The answer of the sufi is perfectly true – except for the pigs! So start remembering...\n[An sannyasin says she has pains in her right leg when doing dynamic and kundalini meditations. Osho checks her energy.]\nDon’t do them. You have a little too much difference between both sides so anything very vigorous will not fit you. Nobody’s sides are ever both the same, nobody’s are the same, but yours are very distant. So whenever these two sides are very far away from each other, anything vigorous can make the distance even more, and that can create trouble. That can give pain and you can start losing energy from the side.\nStop all vigorous methods. You can do sufi dancing; that will be perfectly okay. You can do chanting, you can join the music group – just soft things. And then too you have to do them very softly. Even if the others are doing them vigorously, you go very softly – you have to remember that. And everything will settle, nothing to be worried about, but be very soft.…\nDo the sufi dancing and chanting for at least two months and then the camps are there – you can do the nadabrahma. After two months you ask me again, mm ?\nRight now it is not good to say anything. Right now your energies are really disturbed; let them first settle.. But they will settle: within four to eight weeks they will settle. After two months we will decide what to do, mm?\nAnd you have to be very careful about it, otherwise sometimes it can start having harmful affects, it can almost give you a kind of paralysis. But it will settle; nothing to be worried about.

there!</p><p>[Deva Smrati – divine remembrance. Whenever you have time, Osho is
saying, just remember – remember the beauty of the whole, the
celebration that goes on continuously. When you see the sun, see the
light of god; that will become a remembrance. When you see the moon, see
god. When you are with people, don’t just see their surfaces, look into
their depth. Look into their eyes and you will find god. Soon you will
find god everywhere, throbbing, breathing, living... all that lives is
god. Then slowly, slowly, one becomes so attuned that there is no need
to even remember; one simply knows it is so. This is what sufis call
zikr. That is their only method – to continuously remember god.]</p><p><br></p><p>Once it happened that a sufi went to a western country. It was his
first day in the hotel. He asked for water and then thanked god and
tears started flowing from his eyes. He drank the water and thanked
again.</p><p><br></p><p>A few people who were just sitting around the table started
ridiculing him about what he was doing. They started laughing at him,
and laughingly they asked, ‘Is it done by everybody in your country?’
The sufi said, ‘Except for the pigs, everybody does it.’</p><p><br></p><p>A real man is constantly remembering god. In fact a man is different
from animals only because he remembers god and animals cannot. The
answer of the sufi is perfectly true – except for the pigs! So start
remembering...</p><p><br></p><p>[An sannyasin says she has pains in her right leg when doing dynamic
and kundalini meditations. Osho checks her energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t do them. You have a little too much difference between both
sides so anything very vigorous will not fit you. Nobody’s sides are
ever both the same, nobody’s are the same, but yours are very distant.
So whenever these two sides are very far away from each other, anything
vigorous can make the distance even more, and that can create trouble.
That can give pain and you can start losing energy from the side.</p><p><br></p><p>Stop all vigorous methods. You can do sufi dancing; that will be
perfectly okay. You can do chanting, you can join the music group – just
soft things. And then too you have to do them very softly. Even if the
others are doing them vigorously, you go very softly – you have to
remember that. And everything will settle, nothing to be worried about,
but be very soft.…</p><p><br></p><p>Do the sufi dancing and chanting for at least two months and then the
camps are there – you can do the nadabrahma. After two months you ask me
again, mm ?</p><p><br></p><p>Right now it is not good to say anything. Right now your energies are
really disturbed; let them first settle.. But they will settle: within
four to eight weeks they will settle. After two months we will decide
what to do, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>And you have to be very careful about it, otherwise sometimes it can
start having harmful affects, it can almost give you a kind of
paralysis. But it will settle; nothing to be worried about. Good!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part11>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

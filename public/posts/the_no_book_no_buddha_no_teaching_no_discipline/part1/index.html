It is like a small lamp, but it is more potential than the whole darkness of the whole universe because the darkness is impotent, the darkness cannot win over it. Howsoever long it takes for the light to win, the final victory is with the light, because light is and darkness is not. Darkness is just the absence of light; it does not exist in its own right. It has no positive being, it is just the absence.\nAbsence cannot win, only the presence can win – but darkness is vast. It is big, it is huge, its very hugeness creates fear; and the still, small voice of the conscious is just a small ray in the dark night of the soul. But it has the possibility of a seed. Yes, the seed is small, but it carries tremendous possibilities. Once it starts exploding its being then nothing can prevent it.\nAnd darkness is impotent, I say, because it cannot prevent light; it cannot even fight with light. The moment you bring a lamp into the dark room the darkness simply disappears. It never even gives a single fight; it is very cowardly. It cannot face light so how can it fight light? It is there, enormously there, when the light is not there. It looks big when the light is not present, but when the light is there it is simply not.\nSo a very small part of human beings is conscious – and that is the misery, because the human mind is the only mind on the earth which is in conflict. The animals arc not in conflict, the trees are not in conflict, the rocks are not in conflict, because they have a unitary being. They are fully\n2\nunconscious so the duality does not exist. In a way there is great silence and great peace, but that peace is not worth much.\nWhen man becomes peaceful like a tree, it is similar in a way and not similar at all. When man becomes peaceful it means he becomes totally conscious, the unconsciousness disappears; again a new unity has arisen on a higher plane. The tree exists as a unity on a lower plane: all is dark and there is unity. Buddha exists on the highest plane: all is light and there is unity. And between those two is man – the major part of his being being pulled by the unconscious and just a small fragment being pulled by the conscious. That’s the conflict between god and devil. God and devil are just metaphors; the devil means the dark, the unconscious, the mechanical. And man is torn apart. Where to go?\nThere is only one possibility to go beyond it, and that is to become fully conscious... because we cannot go back. The path simply disappears, the bridge is no more there; you cannot go back. Man has tried in a thousand and one ways to go back.\nThat’s why alcohol is so important, that’s why drugs of all kinds from soma to LSD, have great appeal, because they give you a momentary feeling as if you have again become part of this nature They help you chemically to forget your small conscious island. Again you become the vast continent, one, and a certain unity and a certain organicness... and naturally there is joy!\nBut it is momentary. Sooner or later you come back and you are more frustrated than ever because now you have known a kind of unity; now you will be more frustrated in your ordinary life. That’s what happens to people who are drunkards: they are happy only when they are not, when they are unconscious; they are unhappy when they are.\nAnd there is no way to drop it permanently – this consciousness. It has already happened, there is no way to unlearn it... and it is good that there is no way to unlearn it otherwise the major part of humanity would have unlearned it. Because there is no way to regress one can only go ahead. Yes, unity can be attained, but on a new plane, as a new being, as a totally new being, as a buddha... as an awakened soul.\nThat’s why all the religions have been against drugs. Not that they are against drugs: they are against drugs because drugs give you an illusion of unity. It is just illusory, like a dream, a chemical projection of the paradise lost. You have a feeling that it is regained through drugs but it is not really regained because you fall back again and again. It never becomes your very being, and unless paradise becomes your very being, it is meaningless.\nUnless you become paradise, unless you become god, it is meaningless. Just through a drug trip the feeling that ‘I am god’, is just megalomania. You are tricking yourself, you are befooling yourself and destroying a great opportunity. The same time and the same energy can be put to the only work, the only work that is worthwhile – that is, how to transform the whole being into consciousness.\nIf a small part has become transformed it is indicative that it is possible for the whole consciousness. It is possible, that much is certain, because a small part has already become conscious – the tip of the iceberg. But if the tip can come out of the ocean why not the whole iceberg? There seems to be no intrinsic difficulty; one just has to put one’s energies into it.\nAnd I can see great possibilities in you, so rather than putting your energies into small trivia, direct your energies towards only one thing, and that is how to become more aware, how to become more alert, how to live in a conscious way, deliberately conscious.\nIn the beginning you have to make an effort to be conscious. Once the effort penetrates and has transformed another chunk of your being, then you can forget about it. it remains conscious. Once it becomes conscious, it remains conscious; it cannot fall back – there is no way to fall back. Then you can work on another chunk of your being, and slowly, slowly, inch by inch one starts penetrating one’s own palace. And the deeper you go, the more blissful you become. The day your whole being is full of light is the day of rejoicing!\nThat’s what jesus means when he says, ‘The kingdom of god is within you. But be awake,’ he repeats a thousand and one times. ‘Be awake, remain awake!’\nOne time somebody asked ‘What do you mean by it ?’ He said, ‘It is like the man who went on a long journey. He told his servants, “Remain awake because I can come back any time and I would not like you to be asleep when I come.” He did not tell them when he would be coming – tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, this month, next month, this year or the next year. The servants had to be continuously alert because the master could come any moment!’ Jesus said ‘Like that, god can come any moment into you. Be alert!’ In fact, by being alert you send an invitation to god.\nBy ‘god’ I simply mean all the energy that has already become conscious in existence. I don’t-mean the christian god, one who has created the world – no, all the energy all the buddhas. Christ is a buddha, so is mohammed. The energy of all the people who have become enlightened is there in existence... goes on increasing. Each enlightened person pours his being into it; that’s what god is. The total consciousness that has already happened in existence – that’s what god is.\nIf you make efforts to become aware, that awareness starts flowing towards you because the same attracts the same. If you are unconscious then the unconscious flows towards you because the same attracts the same. So just a small effort to become conscious and you will find more is happening than you are making effort for... and that’s where you start feeling god’s help, never otherwise.\nWhen you make a small effort and you see that the result is too much, more than the effort made, something plus, then for the first time you become aware that god is flowing towards you. Your effort brings something, but something more is happening for which you have not made any effort at all, that’s what is called grace. When the ultimate happens it is not mathematically proportionate to your efforts; your efforts are very tiny. You had asked only for a drop and the whole ocean pours into your being.\nAnd one thing more about buddha that will be helpful to you.Buddha is the only enlightened person\nin the world who has not given any outer structure to be followed. He has given total freedom. He is not like moses; he has no commandments. He never says, ‘Do this, don’t do that.’ Those dos and don’ts may be good for school children but not for grown-up people. And the world has really grown up, hence moses is losing his hold, seems out of date. Buddha is gaining a hold.seems to be very\nvery relevant to the modern mind.\nTwo thousand, five hundred years have passed but the man suddenly is becoming contemporary! Nobody else is so contemporary: krishna is not so contemporary, moses is not so contemporary, not\neven jesus is as contemporary as buddha. Buddha has a tremendous quality, a tremendous appeal for the modern consciousness, and the reason is that he has no outer character to impose. He simply says only one thing has to be learned, and that is awareness; everything will take care of itself. Be alert and nothing can go wrong. Be unconscious and go on following all the commandments and everything will go wrong.\nAn unconscious person cannot be expected to do right – that’s what Buddha’s message is – so it is stupid to teach people to do this and to do that, because they are unconscious and in unconsciousness nothing right is possible. An unconscious man tends to do things wrong. Even if you give him gold he will turn it into mud; his very touch pollutes. His very unconsciousness is poisonous, so it is meaningless to teach man to become virtuous; he cannot. If he becomes virtuous without being conscious he will simply become righteous. That will be an ego trip and he will become more unconscious through it.\nSo Buddha does not want one to become virtuous – he wants one to become aware... and then virtue follows, but it has a totally different quality; you are not imposing it.\nOne great zen master, Rinzai, said to his disciples – this was his last message – ’If on your way you meet the buddha, kill himO you, disciples of the truth, make an effort to free yourselves from\nevery object. O you, with the eyes of moles! I say to you: No Buddha, No Teaching, No Discipline!\n‘What are you ceaselessly looking for in your neighbour’s house ? What then is lacking to you in yourselves ? That which you have at this moment does not differ from that of which the buddha is made.’\nBuddha is the greatest liberator. His own last message to his disciples was, ‘Be a light unto yourself. Buddhas can only point the way.’\nI also don’t give any discipline to my disciples. I don’t initiate you into any kind of character, pattern, shoulds; I don’t give you any ideals. I simply give you one small thing that has to, be worked out within your heart – and that is to be more alert. Do whatsoever you want to do: do it with more consciousness.\nWalking on the road, walk more consciously; keep alert that you are walking. Breathing, doing nothing, just breathe conscious that you are breathing. The breath is going in – be conscious of it; the breath is going out – be conscious of it.\nMake every opportunity a device to become more conscious, and soon more and more consciousness will be flowing in you, will be flooding you.more than you were working for. Then\nyou will see the hands of the divine helping you. And once those hands have been seen, trust arises. Then you know that you are not alone.\nAll those who have ever become enlightened are behind you. Much is at stake in you. It is not only a question of your individual liberation: the whole existence is involved in you. If you become liberated the whole existence is going to become enriched. So it is not the question only of being selfish – that one wants to become peaceful, wants to attain samadhi, wants to attain this and that; this is not simply selfish. It is the greatest altruistic act one can do – to become aware – because by becoming\naware you release awareness into existence, fresh awareness again released. And the quantity, the total quantity of awareness, increases in the world whenever a man becomes alert. The day the total quantity of awareness in the world is more than the total quantity of unawareness there will be a great universal change. Up to now only individuals have become enlightened. That day, the whole humanity will take a quantum leapAnd that day is coming closer. If people work hard, the day is\ncoming closer. So, be a light into yourself! And I saw your letter.…\n[The new sannyasin has written to Osho about his job as a lecturer in microbiology, and whether he should drop it.]\nDrop that – that’s my message: drop it! Follow yourself. It is risky but it is tremendously alive! And never be afraid, because there is nothing to lose, and never compromise, because through compromise one goes on sel!ing one’s soul. The only way to be blissful is to be yourself. If you compromise, if you listen to everybody’s advice and every tom, harry and dick goes on manipulating you, and you allow it, you will be lost.\nIt is nobody’s business to interfere in your life. Just listen to your heart.\nAnd my feeling is that if you drop others’ adviceand it will be easier now by becoming a sannyasin;\nit will become very very easymy feeling is that you will start loving your job, because teaching can\nbe a beautiful phenomenon. But don’t become a teacher; that can create a tension and a heaviness.\nTeaching is good; don’t become a teacher. Enjoy it, explore it, go into it; at the most be a friend to your students, an elderly brother, but not a teacher, not infallible. That brings such a rock-like feeling on the heart, one is crushed. It is so psuedo and hypocritical and so false, pretentious: one goes on just pretending things which are not true.\nJust be a true human being, with all the limitations, with all the fallibility. If you don’t know the answer of a certain question, you can say, ‘I don’t know! Tomorrow I will find out. You also find out; you may find a better answer!’ Get down from the pedestal! I call that ‘pedestalitis’. Get down from the pedestal and you will be unburdened. You also be a student!\nAnd teaching is the best way to learn; one never learns in a better way.When you start teaching people and if you don’t become a teacher and still remain a learner, you learn more than you can ever learn in any other way. By making things clear to others they become clear to you; by teaching others you teach yourselfbut great humbleness is needed.\nMy feeling about you is that you are not troubled by your job as such; you are troubled by some other things. You have become a teacher and that is crippling you. Forget about being a teacher; just be a friend! Enjoy the whole thing! Don’t pretend that you know all – nobody does. Don’t try to become the omnipotent or the omniscient; that’s what teachers down the ages have been doing. That creates a barrier between you and the students, you are standing far away, and that creates a resistance also and a rebellion. Become less serious, bring in more humour, start laughing and be friendlyand fallible. There is no need to become the pope: there is no need to pretend that one is\ninfallible.\nAnd whenever there is a humble teacher, it is a beauty. It is very difficult to find a humble teacher, but if you can then it is a rare joy. And only a humble teacher is a real teacher; all others are just braggards. Pedagogues are not real teachers. Start dropping the dust of others!\nThis sannyas is going to create radical change: it will bring humour, it will bring you down from the pedestal. And become friendly. For a few days try friendship. It will be difficult in the beginning but once it starts flowing you will love it. There is no other joy as beautiful as being a teacher.\nAll the great people of the world, a socrates, a christ, a buddha, are all teachers! We have forgotten the fact that only teachers have given beautiful things to the world.\nA painter works on a canvas, a dead thing, with dead colours. A teacher works on consciousness, on alive people: his canvas is life! And certainly whatsoever he creates has tremendous value. A scientist goes on working on objects; a doctor goes on working on dead limbs, dissecting bodies, treating illnesses.\nA teacher goes on working on the conscious part, that small conscious part. And it is a great joy when you see the conscious part flaring up, when somebody blooms into a new understanding, when you have helped somebody to attain an insight. It is such a joy that I don’t see that there is any joy which can be compared to it.\nSo make it a joy, make it more artful. Mm ? I would like you to become a real teacher! [The new sannyasin says he taught TM till he found EST.]\nYou found rightly! TM is ordinary... a mind trick. EST is far more profound. [The sannyasin replies: Then I discovered you!]\nMm! if you go into EST sooner or later you will discover me! All that is really authentic and is happening anywhere will bring people to me, because once something real happens you hanker for more. When you have tasted something, even a small bite, you hanker for more; then unreal things cannot satisfy you. So EST is going to help many people to come to me. Werner was here a few days ago.…\n[Another sannyasin says: I have to learn much.]\nThat’s true! Everybody has to learn much... and it remains true always. You can learn as much as possible and still it will remain true that one has to learn much; it is never finished.\nLife is such an inexhaustible energy that you can go on learning and learning and learning and still the infinite remains there to be known; it is never finished! And that’s why it is so beautiful – because the exploration can go on and on forever, one can remain in wonder forever. Yes, you have to learn much!\nIf one is ready to learn, one can learn much. In fact people create all kinds of obstacles against learning, because to learn one thing is needed very basically, and that is humbleness. And that is difficult; the ego goes on saying ‘You know it already.’ The ego goes on saying that there is no need to be humble, there is no need to show that you don’t know. The ego goes on pretending knowledgeability.\nOne has to be humble, open, vulnerable, and then life itself becomes the teacher, and life teaches in mysterious ways. Start meditating, do a few groups, mm ? And much is going to happen!\n[A visitor said that when she first read Osho’s books in the west she fell in love with him, but since she has been here she feels further away – the ashram, groups, and sannyasins seems to come between her and Osho.]\nI understand. In fact, reality never conforms to your imagination, and it has no obligation to, either.\nWhen you arr far away from me and you have only heard about me, it is your imagination, your dream; I am not responsible for it. You visualise your own dream, you put in your own colours. Those colours come from your desires; they have nothing to do with me. For example, if you have been missing a father-figure you will create a father-figure of me. If you have been missing a lover you will create a lover of me.\nSo those things that you were imagining were your desires.When you come here the reality is totally different and it may not fit with your desires. It cannot fit with everybody’s desires; so many people, thousands of people, come. If I try to fit with everybody’s desire it will be impossible... so I am myself.\nAnd you have to learn to see the reality. When one drops one’s dreams it hurts, but those dreams are not going to help. I can help you! The Osho of your dreams cannot help you... and if you really want to be helped then it is better to drop all those dreams and encounter me as I am.\nAnd this ashram and these people around me are managed by me. They are not hindrances, they are bridges. The day you understand, you will see that they bridge you with me. The groups and the groupleaders and everything that is happening around here is going to bridge you to me.\nRight now, the way you are, you cannot be bridged. You will have to pass through a few groups. Those groups will shatter many things in you; they will destroy many things which have to be destroyed; they will uproot many weeds. They will prepare the ground, then I can sow the seeds; otherwise it is difficult. You follow me ?\nAnd these sannyasins are creating a certain milieu. You can grow only in that milieu: it is an atmosphere, a climate. You don’t know how you can grow, you don’t know the ways of growth. If you are alone here with me it may be impossible for you to have any contact with me.\nIt is just like [the interpreter]: she is interpreting. If she is not here there will be no bridge. You speak one language, I speak another language; somebody is needed to interpret. And the same is true about many things: I speak a totally different kind of language. Many people are needed to interpret it in many ways so it can reach you.\nOf course in the beginning you will feel ‘Why are so many people standing in between ? Why not give me way so I can go direct ?’ I can understand your desire but that desire is not going to help you. If you have really come it is better to settle with the reality... and you will be benefited. Once you have entered into the reality of things here you will be able to see that all your dreams were meaningless; it is good that they have disappeared.\nEverybody comes with many many reveries. It is not only you, it is everybody’s case. And of course they feel difficulties. They come here and they want to be with me for twenty-four hours, but there is the appointment and Laxmi and the secretary and the office. Then there is Maneesha sniffing (at the gate before darshan) and she will throw you out and will not allow you. So you have to pass through all kinds of difficulties; it is an obstacle course!\nBut it is good! It tests you – your patience, your love, your longing, how long you can wait. How much you love me will depend on how long you can wait. That will show your love, and your love will grow. The day you are ready there is nobody hindering your path, nobody. These people are hindering you only till you are ready.\nSo what about your sannyas now ?\n[She says she doesn’t know yet because she felt rejected... not right now but in these situations.]\nMm mm, so wait, mm? and do a few groups and go through these people. What can they do ? Don’t be afraid of them!\nDo a few groups and soon you will feel that you are coming closer to me, closer to my reality rather than to your dreams. And remain available. You have come; try to be open and try to see what is really happening here. If you carry too many ideas of how it should happen you will not be able to learn anything and if you miss you miss at your own risk.\nFor example if you come with the idea that the door will be of gold, then you enter the temple and find the door is of wood.Are you concerned with the temple or with the door ? Even the temple is\nirrelevant! Are you concerned with the deity inside the temple or with the temple ?\nRemain concerned with the essential and remain open, mm ? The sannyas is going to happen: you cannot escape!\n[A sannyasin who is leaving says he is the only sannyasin in the state where he lives... he was teaching yoga and introduced Osho’s meditations to his class.]\nSo you start helping people to become sannyasins! If I have one sannyasin that is enough, mm ? then many more will be coming.\nYou introduce more methods and help people, mm ? One sannyasin is enough to convert the whole state! A small spark is enough to burn the whole forest, mm ?.and these orange people are fire!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"4438","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_no_book_no_buddha_no_teaching_no_discipline/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_no_book_no_buddha_no_teaching_no_discipline/>The No Book (No Buddha, No Teaching, No Discipline)</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">1</h1><div class=post-meta>21 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;4438 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_No_Book_No_Buddha_No_Teaching_No_Discipline/part1.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |
<a href=part2>Next ></a></p><p><span id=bookmark0>‌</span>CHAPTER <span class=s3>1</span></p><p><br></p><p>1 August 1977 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium</p><p><br></p><p>Anand means bliss, blissfulness, and buddha means the awakened state
of consciousness – the utterly awakened state when there is no more any
unconscious desire, when there is no dark corner left, when all is
consciousness within... when the conscious goes on spreading, spreading,
and takes over the whole territory of the unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a very minute part is conscious now, just a small potential; it
is small, but it is very potential. It is like a small lamp, but it is
more potential than the whole darkness of the whole universe because the
darkness is impotent, the darkness cannot win over it. Howsoever long it
takes for the light to win, the final victory is with the light, because
light is and darkness is not. Darkness is just the absence of light; it
does not exist in its own right. It has no positive being, it is just
the absence.</p><p><br></p><p>Absence cannot win, only the presence can win – but darkness is vast.
It is big, it is huge, its very hugeness creates fear; and the still,
small voice of the conscious is just a small ray in the dark night of
the soul. But it has the possibility of a seed. Yes, the seed is small,
but it carries tremendous possibilities. Once it starts exploding its
being then nothing can prevent it.</p><p><br></p><p>And darkness is impotent, I say, because it cannot prevent light; it
cannot even fight with light. The moment you bring a lamp into the dark
room the darkness simply disappears. It never even gives a single fight;
it is very cowardly. It cannot face light so how can it fight light? It
is there, enormously there, when the light is not there. It looks big
when the light is not present, but when the light is there it is simply
not.</p><p><br></p><p>So a very small part of human beings is conscious – and that is the
misery, because the human mind is the only mind on the earth which is in
conflict. The animals arc not in conflict, the trees are not in
conflict, the rocks are not in conflict, because they have a unitary
being. They are fully</p><p><br></p><p>2</p><p>unconscious so the duality does not exist. In a way there is great
silence and great peace, but that peace is not worth much.</p><p><br></p><p>When man becomes peaceful like a tree, it is similar in a way and not
similar at all. When man becomes peaceful it means he becomes totally
conscious, the unconsciousness disappears; again a new unity has arisen
on a higher plane. The tree exists as a unity on a lower plane: all is
dark and there is unity. Buddha exists on the highest plane: all is
light and there is unity. And between those two is man – the major part
of his being being pulled by the unconscious and just a small fragment
being pulled by the conscious. That’s the conflict between god and
devil. God and devil are just metaphors; the devil means the dark, the
unconscious, the mechanical. And man is torn apart. Where to go?</p><p><br></p><p>There is only one possibility to go beyond it, and that is to become
fully conscious... because we cannot go back. The path simply
disappears, the bridge is no more there; you cannot go back. Man has
tried in a thousand and one ways to go back.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why alcohol is so important, that’s why drugs of all kinds
from soma to LSD, have great appeal, because they give you a momentary
feeling as if you have again become part of this nature They help you
chemically to forget your small conscious island. Again you become the
vast continent, one, and a certain unity and a certain organicness...
and naturally there is joy!</p><p><br></p><p>But it is momentary. Sooner or later you come back and you are more
frustrated than ever because now you have known a kind of unity; now you
will be more frustrated in your ordinary life. That’s what happens to
people who are drunkards: they are happy only when they are not, when
they are unconscious; they are unhappy when they are.</p><p><br></p><p>And there is no way to drop it permanently – this consciousness. It
has already happened, there is no way to unlearn it... and it is good
that there is no way to unlearn it otherwise the major part of humanity
would have unlearned it. Because there is no way to regress one can only
go ahead. Yes, unity can be attained, but on a new plane, as a new
being, as a totally new being, as a buddha... as an awakened soul.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why all the religions have been against drugs. Not that they
are against drugs: they are against drugs because drugs give you an
illusion of unity. It is just illusory, like a dream, a chemical
projection of the paradise lost. You have a feeling that it is regained
through drugs but it is not really regained because you fall back again
and again. It never becomes your very being, and unless paradise becomes
your very being, it is meaningless.</p><p><br></p><p>Unless you become paradise, unless you become god, it is meaningless.
Just through a drug trip the feeling that ‘I am god’, is just
megalomania. You are tricking yourself, you are befooling yourself and
destroying a great opportunity. The same time and the same energy can be
put to the only work, the only work that is worthwhile – that is, how to
transform the whole being into consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>If a small part has become transformed it is indicative that it is
possible for the whole consciousness. It is possible, that much is
certain, because a small part has already become conscious – the tip of
the iceberg. But if the tip can come out of the ocean why not the whole
iceberg? There seems to be no intrinsic difficulty; one just has to put
one’s energies into it.</p><p>And I can see great possibilities in you, so rather than putting your
energies into small trivia, direct your energies towards only one thing,
and that is how to become more aware, how to become more alert, how to
live in a conscious way, deliberately conscious.</p><p><br></p><p>In the beginning you have to make an effort to be conscious. Once the
effort penetrates and has transformed another chunk of your being, then
you can forget about it. it remains conscious. Once it becomes
conscious, it remains conscious; it cannot fall back – there is no way
to fall back. Then you can work on another chunk of your being, and
slowly, slowly, inch by inch one starts penetrating one’s own palace.
And the deeper you go, the more blissful you become. The day your whole
being is full of light is the day of rejoicing!</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what jesus means when he says, ‘The kingdom of god is within
you. But be awake,’ he repeats a thousand and one times. ‘Be awake,
remain awake!’</p><p><br></p><p>One time somebody asked ‘What do you mean by it ?’ He said, ‘It is
like the man who went on a long journey. He told his servants, “Remain
awake because I can come back any time and I would not like you to be
asleep when I come.” He did not tell them when he would be coming –
tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, this month, next month, this year or
the next year. The servants had to be continuously alert because the
master could come any moment!’ Jesus said ‘Like that, god can come any
moment into you. Be alert!’ In fact, by being alert you send an
invitation to god.</p><p><br></p><p>By ‘god’ I simply mean all the energy that has already become
conscious in existence. I don’t-mean the christian god, one who has
created the world – no, all the energy all the buddhas. Christ is a
buddha, so is mohammed. The energy of all the people who have become
enlightened is there in existence... goes on increasing. Each
enlightened person pours his being into it; that’s what god is. The
total consciousness that has already happened in existence – that’s what
god is.</p><p><br></p><p>If you make efforts to become aware, that awareness starts flowing
towards you because the same attracts the same. If you are unconscious
then the unconscious flows towards you because the same attracts the
same. So just a small effort to become conscious and you will find more
is happening than you are making effort for... and that’s where you
start feeling god’s help, never otherwise.</p><p><br></p><p>When you make a small effort and you see that the result is too much,
more than the effort made, something plus, then for the first time you
become aware that god is flowing towards you. Your effort brings
something, but something more is happening for which you have not made
any effort at all, that’s what is called grace. When the ultimate
happens it is not mathematically proportionate to your efforts; your
efforts are very tiny. You had asked only for a drop and the whole ocean
pours into your being.</p><p><br></p><p>And one thing more about buddha that will be helpful to you.<span class=s4></span>Buddha is the only enlightened person</p><p>in the world who has not given any outer structure to be followed. He
has given total freedom. He is not like moses; he has no commandments.
He never says, ‘Do this, don’t do that.’ Those dos and don’ts may be
good for school children but not for grown-up people. And the world has
really grown up, hence moses is losing his hold, seems out of date.
Buddha is gaining a hold.<span class=s4></span>seems to be very</p><p>very relevant to the modern mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Two thousand, five hundred years have passed but the man suddenly is
becoming contemporary! Nobody else is so contemporary: krishna is not so
contemporary, moses is not so contemporary, not</p><p>even jesus is as contemporary as buddha. Buddha has a tremendous
quality, a tremendous appeal for the modern consciousness, and the
reason is that he has no outer character to impose. He simply says only
one thing has to be learned, and that is awareness; everything will take
care of itself. Be alert and nothing can go wrong. Be unconscious and go
on following all the commandments and everything will go wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>An unconscious person cannot be expected to do right – that’s what
Buddha’s message is – so it is stupid to teach people to do this and to
do that, because they are unconscious and in unconsciousness nothing
right is possible. An unconscious man tends to do things wrong. Even if
you give him gold he will turn it into mud; his very touch pollutes. His
very unconsciousness is poisonous, so it is meaningless to teach man to
become virtuous; he cannot. If he becomes virtuous without being
conscious he will simply become righteous. That will be an ego trip and
he will become more unconscious through it.</p><p><br></p><p>So Buddha does not want one to become virtuous – he wants one to
become aware... and then virtue follows, but it has a totally different
quality; you are not imposing it.</p><p><br></p><p>One great zen master, Rinzai, said to his disciples – this was his
last message – ’If on your way you meet the buddha, kill him<span class=s4></span>O you, disciples of the truth, make an effort to free
yourselves from</p><p>every object. O you, with the eyes of moles! I say to you: No Buddha,
No Teaching, No Discipline!</p><p><br></p><p>‘What are you ceaselessly looking for in your neighbour’s house ?
What then is lacking to you in yourselves ? That which you have at this
moment does not differ from that of which the buddha is made.’</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha is the greatest liberator. His own last message to his
disciples was, ‘Be a light unto yourself. Buddhas can only point the
way.’</p><p><br></p><p>I also don’t give any discipline to my disciples. I don’t initiate
you into any kind of character, pattern, shoulds; I don’t give you any
ideals. I simply give you one small thing that has to, be worked out
within your heart – and that is to be more alert. Do whatsoever you want
to do: do it with more consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Walking on the road, walk more consciously; keep alert that you are
walking. Breathing, doing nothing, just breathe conscious that you are
breathing. The breath is going in – be conscious of it; the breath is
going out – be conscious of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Make every opportunity a device to become more conscious, and soon
more and more consciousness will be flowing in you, will be flooding
you.<span class=s4></span>more than you were working for. Then</p><p>you will see the hands of the divine helping you. And once those
hands have been seen, trust arises. Then you know that you are not
alone.</p><p><br></p><p>All those who have ever become enlightened are behind you. Much is at
stake in you. It is not only a question of your individual liberation:
the whole existence is involved in you. If you become liberated the
whole existence is going to become enriched. So it is not the question
only of being selfish – that one wants to become peaceful, wants to
attain samadhi, wants to attain this and that; this is not simply
selfish. It is the greatest altruistic act one can do – to become aware
– because by becoming</p><p>aware you release awareness into existence, fresh awareness again
released. And the quantity, the total quantity of awareness, increases
in the world whenever a man becomes alert. The day the total quantity of
awareness in the world is more than the total quantity of unawareness
there will be a great universal change. Up to now only individuals have
become enlightened. That day, the whole humanity will take a quantum
leap<span class=s4></span>And that day is coming closer. If people
work hard, the day is</p><p>coming closer. So, be a light into yourself! And I saw your
letter.…</p><p><br></p><p>[The new sannyasin has written to Osho about his job as a lecturer in
microbiology, and whether he should drop it.]</p><p>Drop that – that’s my message: drop it! Follow yourself. It is risky
but it is tremendously alive! And never be afraid, because there is
nothing to lose, and never compromise, because through compromise one
goes on sel!ing one’s soul. The only way to be blissful is to be
yourself. If you compromise, if you listen to everybody’s advice and
every tom, harry and dick goes on manipulating you, and you allow it,
you will be lost.</p><p>It is nobody’s business to interfere in your life. Just listen to
your heart.</p><p><br></p><p>And my feeling is that if you drop others’ advice<span class=s4></span>and it will be easier now by becoming a sannyasin;</p><p>it will become very very easy<span class=s4></span>my feeling is
that you will start loving your job, because teaching can</p><p>be a beautiful phenomenon. But don’t become a teacher; that can
create a tension and a heaviness.</p><p><br></p><p>Teaching is good; don’t become a teacher. Enjoy it, explore it, go
into it; at the most be a friend to your students, an elderly brother,
but not a teacher, not infallible. That brings such a rock-like feeling
on the heart, one is crushed. It is so psuedo and hypocritical and so
false, pretentious: one goes on just pretending things which are not
true.</p><p>Just be a true human being, with all the limitations, with all the
fallibility. If you don’t know the answer of a certain question, you can
say, ‘I don’t know! Tomorrow I will find out. You also find out; you may
find a better answer!’ Get down from the pedestal! I call that
‘pedestalitis’. Get down from the pedestal and you will be unburdened.
You also be a student!</p><p>And teaching is the best way to learn; one never learns in a better
way.When you start teaching people and if you don’t become a teacher and
still remain a learner, you learn more than you can ever learn in any
other way. By making things clear to others they become clear to you; by
teaching others you teach yourself<span class=s4></span>but great
humbleness is needed.</p><p>My feeling about you is that you are not troubled by your job as
such; you are troubled by some other things. You have become a teacher
and that is crippling you. Forget about being a teacher; just be a
friend! Enjoy the whole thing! Don’t pretend that you know all – nobody
does. Don’t try to become the omnipotent or the omniscient; that’s what
teachers down the ages have been doing. That creates a barrier between
you and the students, you are standing far away, and that creates a
resistance also and a rebellion. Become less serious, bring in more
humour, start laughing and be friendly<span class=s4></span>and
fallible. There is no need to become the pope: there is no need to
pretend that one is</p><p>infallible.</p><p><br></p><p>And whenever there is a humble teacher, it is a beauty. It is very
difficult to find a humble teacher, but if you can then it is a rare
joy. And only a humble teacher is a real teacher; all others are just
braggards. Pedagogues are not real teachers. Start dropping the dust of
others!</p><p>This sannyas is going to create radical change: it will bring humour,
it will bring you down from the pedestal. And become friendly. For a few
days try friendship. It will be difficult in the beginning but once it
starts flowing you will love it. There is no other joy as beautiful as
being a teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>All the great people of the world, a socrates, a christ, a buddha,
are all teachers! We have forgotten the fact that only teachers have
given beautiful things to the world.</p><p><br></p><p>A painter works on a canvas, a dead thing, with dead colours. A
teacher works on consciousness, on alive people: his canvas is life! And
certainly whatsoever he creates has tremendous value. A scientist goes
on working on objects; a doctor goes on working on dead limbs,
dissecting bodies, treating illnesses.</p><p><br></p><p>A teacher goes on working on the conscious part, that small conscious
part. And it is a great joy when you see the conscious part flaring up,
when somebody blooms into a new understanding, when you have helped
somebody to attain an insight. It is such a joy that I don’t see that
there is any joy which can be compared to it.</p><p><br></p><p>So make it a joy, make it more artful. Mm ? I would like you to
become a real teacher! [The new sannyasin says he taught TM till he
found EST.]</p><p>You found rightly! TM is ordinary... a mind trick. EST is far more
profound. [The sannyasin replies: Then I discovered you!]</p><p>Mm! if you go into EST sooner or later you will discover me! All that
is really authentic and is happening anywhere will bring people to me,
because once something real happens you hanker for more. When you have
tasted something, even a small bite, you hanker for more; then unreal
things cannot satisfy you. So EST is going to help many people to come
to me. Werner was here a few days ago.…</p><p><br></p><p>[Another sannyasin says: I have to learn much.]</p><p><br></p><p>That’s true! Everybody has to learn much... and it remains true
always. You can learn as much as possible and still it will remain true
that one has to learn much; it is never finished.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is such an inexhaustible energy that you can go on learning and
learning and learning and still the infinite remains there to be known;
it is never finished! And that’s why it is so beautiful – because the
exploration can go on and on forever, one can remain in wonder forever.
Yes, you have to learn much!</p><p><br></p><p>If one is ready to learn, one can learn much. In fact people create
all kinds of obstacles against learning, because to learn one thing is
needed very basically, and that is humbleness. And that is difficult;
the ego goes on saying ‘You know it already.’ The ego goes on saying
that there is no need to be humble, there is no need to show that you
don’t know. The ego goes on pretending knowledgeability.</p><p>One has to be humble, open, vulnerable, and then life itself becomes
the teacher, and life teaches in mysterious ways. Start meditating, do a
few groups, mm ? And much is going to happen!</p><p><br></p><p>[A visitor said that when she first read Osho’s books in the west she
fell in love with him, but since she has been here she feels further
away – the ashram, groups, and sannyasins seems to come between her and
Osho.]</p><p><br></p><p>I understand. In fact, reality never conforms to your imagination,
and it has no obligation to, either.</p><p><br></p><p>When you arr far away from me and you have only heard about me, it is
your imagination, your dream; I am not responsible for it. You visualise
your own dream, you put in your own colours. Those colours come from
your desires; they have nothing to do with me. For example, if you have
been missing a father-figure you will create a father-figure of me. If
you have been missing a lover you will create a lover of me.</p><p><br></p><p>So those things that you were imagining were your desires.When you
come here the reality is totally different and it may not fit with your
desires. It cannot fit with everybody’s desires; so many people,
thousands of people, come. If I try to fit with everybody’s desire it
will be impossible... so I am myself.</p><p><br></p><p>And you have to learn to see the reality. When one drops one’s dreams
it hurts, but those dreams are not going to help. I can help you! The
Osho of your dreams cannot help you... and if you really want to be
helped then it is better to drop all those dreams and encounter me as I
am.</p><p><br></p><p>And this ashram and these people around me are managed by me. They
are not hindrances, they are bridges. The day you understand, you will
see that they bridge you with me. The groups and the groupleaders and
everything that is happening around here is going to bridge you to
me.</p><p><br></p><p>Right now, the way you are, you cannot be bridged. You will have to
pass through a few groups. Those groups will shatter many things in you;
they will destroy many things which have to be destroyed; they will
uproot many weeds. They will prepare the ground, then I can sow the
seeds; otherwise it is difficult. You follow me ?</p><p><br></p><p>And these sannyasins are creating a certain milieu. You can grow only
in that milieu: it is an atmosphere, a climate. You don’t know how you
can grow, you don’t know the ways of growth. If you are alone here with
me it may be impossible for you to have any contact with me.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like [the interpreter]: she is interpreting. If she is not
here there will be no bridge. You speak one language, I speak another
language; somebody is needed to interpret. And the same is true about
many things: I speak a totally different kind of language. Many people
are needed to interpret it in many ways so it can reach you.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course in the beginning you will feel ‘Why are so many people
standing in between ? Why not give me way so I can go direct ?’ I can
understand your desire but that desire is not going to help you. If you
have really come it is better to settle with the reality... and you will
be benefited. Once you have entered into the reality of things here you
will be able to see that all your dreams were meaningless; it is good
that they have disappeared.</p><p>Everybody comes with many many reveries. It is not only you, it is
everybody’s case. And of course they feel difficulties. They come here
and they want to be with me for twenty-four hours, but there is the
appointment and Laxmi and the secretary and the office. Then there is
Maneesha sniffing (at the gate before darshan) and she will throw you
out and will not allow you. So you have to pass through all kinds of
difficulties; it is an obstacle course!</p><p><br></p><p>But it is good! It tests you – your patience, your love, your
longing, how long you can wait. How much you love me will depend on how
long you can wait. That will show your love, and your love will grow.
The day you are ready there is nobody hindering your path, nobody. These
people are hindering you only till you are ready.</p><p><br></p><p>So what about your sannyas now ?</p><p><br></p><p>[She says she doesn’t know yet because she felt rejected... not right
now but in these situations.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm mm, so wait, mm? and do a few groups and go through these people.
What can they do ? Don’t be afraid of them!</p><p><br></p><p>Do a few groups and soon you will feel that you are coming closer to
me, closer to my reality rather than to your dreams. And remain
available. You have come; try to be open and try to see what is really
happening here. If you carry too many ideas of how it should happen you
will not be able to learn anything and if you miss you miss at your own
risk.</p><p><br></p><p>For example if you come with the idea that the door will be of gold,
then you enter the temple and find the door is of wood.<span class=s4></span>Are you concerned with the temple or with the door ?
Even the temple is</p><p>irrelevant! Are you concerned with the deity inside the temple or
with the temple ?</p><p><br></p><p>Remain concerned with the essential and remain open, mm ? The sannyas

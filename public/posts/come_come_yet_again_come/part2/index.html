YOU SAY\nSANNYAS MEANS TO GET RID OF ALL CONDITIONING AND TO ESCAPE OUT\nOF EVERY CAGE WHETHER IT IS RELIGIOUS, PHILOSOPHICAL OR\nPOLITICAL. BUT ISN'T CAPITALISM A CAGE TOO? WHY CAN'T WE LIVE A CREATIVE LIFE IN WEALTH AND FREEDOM WITHOUT ANY \"ISMS\"?\nSwami Prem Vardan, capitalism is not an \"ism\" at all; just don't get too obsessed by the word. Sometimes words become too important to us and we tend to forget the reality.\nCapitalism is not an ideology; it is not imposed on the society, it is a natural growth. It is not like communism, or fascism, or socialism -- these are ideologies; they have to be imposed. Capitalism has come on its own. In fact, the word \"capitalism\" has been given by the anticapitalist thinkers: the communists, the socialists and others. Capitalism is a state of freedom; that's exactly why I am in support of it. It allows you all kinds of freedoms. Communism will not allow you all kinds of freedoms; communism will give you only one ideology to believe in -- there is no question of choice.\nI am reminded of Henry Ford.…\nWhen he made his first model, those cars were only made in one color -- black. And he himself used to take the customers round his showroom; he would go around with them and show them the cars. He used to say to people, \"You are free to choose any color, provided it is black!\"\nThat's exactly the attitude of communism: you are free to choose any ideology, any philosophy, any religion, provided it is communism. In a communist society there is no hope for a multidimensional humanity to grow; it can allow only a certain type to grow: it is linear. You cannot conceive that in a communist pattern even Karl Marx would be possible; he would not be allowed. You cannot conceive a Jesus, a Buddha, a Krishna, or a Lao Tzu being born in a communist society; they would be destroyed at the very beginning.\nBefore the Russian revolution, Russia produced the greatest novelists in the world.\nBefore the revolution, Russia passed through an immense period of creativity; it was almost an explosion. Nowhere else, in no other time, were so many great artists born together: Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Anton Chekhov, Maxim Gorky, Turgenev, and many more. What happened to all that creativity after the Russian revolution? Not a single Tolstoy, not a single Dostoevsky, not a single\nMaxim Gorky has appeared. It is impossible, because the government directs you about what to write, what not to write.\nThe bureaucracy dictates everything. You cannot paint according to your own heart, you cannot sing the song that you want to sing; you have to dance to the tune that the government plays. Naturally, only mediocre people have been happy in Russia.\nUntalented people will find it very good, but talented people, who are the salt of the earth, will be retarded.\nOnly one outlet is there, to go into politics, and that too is not easy. Once you are in power it is very difficult for anybody else to replace you. Joseph Stalin remained in power longer than any other person, and he was hated by the people from their very guts, but nobody was able to say anything. He killed more people than Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, Nadirshah; even Adolf Hitler comes second to him. And he killed very methodically. It is estimated that he must have killed several million people at least, with no guilt.\nThe day he died and Krushchev came into power, Krushchev started saying things against him. Even his dead body was removed from the Kremlin, from the place where it had been ceremoniously placed. It was dragged from the grave in a very insulting way and removed to a faraway place which nobody visits.\nKrushchev had always served Stalin as a servant, and when he started saying things against him.… In one of the meetings of communist workers he was talking against Stalin, and a worker shouted from the back row, \"Where were you when he was alive?\nWhy didn't you say these things when he was alive?\"\nFor a moment there was a very uneasy silence. Even Krushchev could not find any words. Then he asked, \"Can I ask one thing, sir? Can you stand up, comrade? Who has asked this question?\" And Krushchev laughed and he said, \"Now you know! That's my answer!\"\nCommunism is an \"ism\"; capitalism is not an \"ism.\" Capitalism is simply a natural phenomenon that has come on its own. There are no capitalist philosophers, there is no capitalist party, there is no capitalist economy which has been enforced on people; it is a growth.\nBut you seem, Vardan, to be too attached to the word. Rather than looking at the reality you have become distracted by the word \"capitalism.\" It simply means a state of LAISSEZ-FAIRE, a state of freedom where one is allowed to be himself. Capitalism is not an \"ism\" but a natural state of society which is capable of producing capital, which is capable of producing wealth.\nNow for sixty years or more communism has existed in Russia. Still, communism existing in Russia has not been able to make it a rich society; it is a poor country. Of course they go on competing as far as war technology is concerned, but the people are poor. America is far richer; in fact, it is the richest society that has ever existed on the earth. Even the poorest man in America is in a far better situation than any Russian, for the simple reason that people are allowed to produce wealth if they choose to. If they choose not to produce wealth, if they want to be painters, poets, they are allowed -- that is their freedom, that is their birthright. In communism you don't have any birthright.\nAnd remember, equality is a very unpsychological idea. People are not equal. Albert Einstein, Karl Marx, Gautam Buddha, Jesus, Mohammed, Ghalib -- can you consider that these people are equal? The society consists of thousands of types; it is beautiful because of the variety. Communism destroys variety. It makes people in a certain pattern, it gives them a certain structure. The whole society becomes like an army: everybody is regimented, everybody is following a certain ideal.\nDon't be too obsessed with the simple word \"capitalism.\" But we live in words...the very word, the mention of the word, can create anger in you. That simply shows anger is there.\nAnd it is a natural phenomenon, particularly when you are the disciple of a master -- deep down you are angry at him. There are reasons for it, because surrendering is going against your ego, and the ego is always ready to take revenge -- any excuse will do.\nJudas betrayed Jesus. Do you think he simply betrayed Jesus because of thirty silver coins? That is not the case. Judas would not have betrayed him for only thirty silver coins. He had lived for a long time with Jesus, had loved him, worshipped him, was surrendered to him. Then what came over him? And he felt immensely guilty: the day Jesus was crucified...within twenty-four hours Judas committed suicide out of sheer guilt.\nWhat had he done? He could not survive, he could not live -- the guilt was too heavy.\nBut nobody has looked into the psychology of Judas. So many people have researched deeply into the psychology of Jesus, but nobody has bothered to look into the psychology of Judas, which is worth studying because masters are few and disciples are many, and their psychology should be understood. And it is not the first case.…\nGautam Buddha was betrayed by his own cousin-brother who was a disciple; Devadatta was his name. Mahavira was betrayed by his own son-in-law who was his disciple. It is almost an inevitable phenomenon that each master has been betrayed by somebody who was very close. Why? There must be some hidden reason. Don't just condemn Judas; Judas is only one of the examples.\nTo surrender to a master creates anger. Unwillingly you have to surrender, finding no other way. You have tried every possible way to be on your own, but the more efforts you have made, the deeper you have gone into the mess. So ultimately, as a last resort, you surrender. But the unwillingness is there. You would have been far more happy if there had been no need to surrender. But because there is nothing else to do -- you have done everything and it has all failed -- you need somebody's help and support, you need somebody's guidance. And in spiritual matters, guidance is possible only if you trust, if you surrender, if you put your ego aside. So you put it aside, but very unwillingly, reluctantly, and it waits for its own time to take revenge. So any small excuse becomes a very big thing.\nNow the word \"capitalism\" is torturing you. If you understand me, what you are saying is exactly what I mean by capitalism.\nYou say: \"Why can't we live a creative life in wealth and freedom without any ìsms'?\"\nThat's exactly what capitalism is! Drop the word \"ism,\" find something else. I am not much concerned with words. I am not a linguist, not a grammarian.\nNoah Webster, the lexicographer, was in his office making love to his secretary, when Mrs. Webster walked in.\n\"Noah!\" she gasped. \"I am surprised!\"\nQuickly pulling his trousers up, he replied, \"Not so, my dear. You are shocked, I am surprised!\"\nThe grammarian, the lexicographer, the linguist, is continuously thinking of words. He is right! He says, \"No, you are shocked -- you are using the wrong word -- I am surprised!\"\nBut it is not a question of words at all.\nDon't get too obsessed with words; otherwise you will be getting angry again and again.\nIf you want to be angry, that's another matter; then you can find any excuse. And you will find a thousand and one -- I can provide you with as many excuses as possible!\n\"You say sannyas means to get rid of all conditioning \" Yes, and it includes the\nobsession with words too. And you say, \"to escape out of every cage \" True.\nCapitalism is the only state where you are not forced to live in a cage, you are free. But capitalism is in a very dangerous state, for the simple reason that there are only a few people who are capable of creating wealth, and they create great jealousy in others. Those who cannot create wealth become jealous -- and there are more of them.\nJust think: if society were ruled by poets, people would be angry at poetry, because only a few people are capable of creating poetry -- a Shakespeare, a Milton, a Kalidas, a Rabindranath.… Only very few people are able to create poetry, and they would be the rulers. What about the ninety-nine point nine percent of people who are absolutely unpoetic? They would become very angry. Or if the society were ruled by musicians, then what about those who cannot produce music, who are not creative in that dimension? Then Beethoven, Mozart, Wagner...a few people would be able to dominate; they would be at the top. And what about the others? The millions would feel angry. The same is true with capitalism: very few people are capable of creating wealth; it is a dimension of creativity. Not everybody is a Ford or a Morgan or a Rockefeller. This is bound to be so.\nBut to understand your jealousy and to get rid of it is sannyas. To understand your jealousy will help you tremendously to find your dimension of creativity.\nEverybody is born with a certain potential, but it is not the same and it is good that it is not the same.\nIf everybody was a Shakespeare, literature would lose all joy. If everybody was a Jesus, carrying his own cross, the whole scene would look very crazy! And those Jesuses would go on carrying their crosses, and who would crucify them? They would not find anyone to crucify them! It would be a very very long and tedious journey to nowhere. They would die natural deaths, carrying their crosses unnecessarily. It is good that everybody is not a Jesus, not a Buddha.…\nEverybody has to be himself, and capitalism simply gives you the possibility to be yourself. Certainly you will have to prove your mettle, you will have to work; you will have to create, you will have to bring your total energy to a focus. But only then will you be able to shine forth.\nCapitalism is basically individualism, it is not a social structure. It is more than that; it is just democracy and freedom. But when you allow everybody to be himself, certainly you will feel very jealous, because you can only be one thing and there will be many people who can be many other things. Somebody will be a poet, somebody will be a sculptor, somebody will be a novelist, somebody will be a musician, a dancer, an architect, a scientist...and maybe you are just a boxer. But there is no need to be worried -- you can be the greatest boxer in the world! One has to look within oneself and discover one's potential.\nCapitalism gives you the freedom to be yourself; that's why I support it. My support has reasons behind it. I am not supporting it as an economical phenomenon; there is much more involved in my support. And to my understanding, capitalism will bring a socialism of its own kind as a by-product, because when people have created too much wealth, what are they going to do with it? What will you do with the wealth when you have created it?\nAlbert Einstein discovers the theory of relativity, the secret of atomic energy; then it becomes part of the whole society, then sooner or later everybody is going to be benefited by it. A few people will create wealth, but they will reveal the secrets of how to create wealth. Sooner or later this whole society will be benefited by it.\nA real socialism will come out of capitalism as a by-product. When too much wealth is created, people will not be so greedy; the greed arises only because the\nwealth is very scarce. And you can see it very clearly -- you can see it here. The poor person is very greedy, the rich person is not so greedy. The people who are coming from the West are less greedy than the people who are living in India. The Indians TALK about no-greed, greedlessness, but they are the most greedy people in the world. They have to be -- they are so poor, they have to cling.\nIt happens almost every day: some Western sannyasin will turn up at the office and will say, \"I would like to donate ten lakh rupees, but I don't want my name to be mentioned because this is not such a big thing.\" But no Indian turns up even with ten rupees! If you want ten rupees from Indians you have to go to them and persuade them. Then too it will be very difficult for them. They will give you ten rupees only if you convince them: \"You will be getting a thousandfold more in the other world.\" Then they will give; otherwise not. Unless they are convinced and you prove through the scriptures that they will get a thousandfold, exactly a thousandfold more; unless it is a business proposal.… And it is a really good business! You give ten rupees here, and you get a thousandfold more there!\nWhere can you get that much interest? It is almost like winning a lottery! Then it is worth risking ten rupees.\nI had to stop Indians completely. I have told my office people, \"Don't accept from Indians, because we don't want money with any conditions.\" They bring their conditions also -- they are donating ten rupees, but they will bring their conditions. And these conditions have to be fulfilled: \"Osho should not say this; Osho should say this.\" Just because they are donating ten rupees they want to control everything -- how sannyasins should behave, how they should move around in the society. Just because of their ten rupees all the sannyasins have to follow a certain moral code decided by them.\nYou can see it easily: the West has created enough wealth; the greed is disappearing. But in the East, the greed has gone on increasing more and more. In fact, because there is so much greed, people talk about greedlessness. The saints go on teaching people, \"Don't be greedy,\" because they know they are greedy; otherwise, why would they teach that? It would be stupid to talk that way.\nI have seen the most ancient scriptures. They all talk about greedlessness, nonattachment; they all talk about nonviolence, no stealing, no adultery. Look on everybody's wife as your mother or sister or daughter, as the case may be...the\nmost ancient scriptures! All these rules of conduct prove only one thing: that man has always been just the opposite; otherwise, why so much fuss about committing adultery? The most ancient scriptures talk about it: \"Don't commit adultery.\" People must have been committing adultery! Either the people were committing adultery or these people who were writing the scriptures were crazy!\nPeople must have been very greedy, because all the Jaina scriptures, almost on every page, talk about greedlessness, as if that was the only obsession of the people.\n\"Renounce,\" they all say; \"gold is dust.\" If gold is dust, why renounce it? Nobody renounces dust! Even those scriptures don't say, \"Renounce dust because dust is just gold and nothing else, so renounce it. Don't touch dust because it is just gold.\" But they all talk about renouncing gold, and in the same breath they go on saying it is dust. They are contradicting themselves. And the people they are talking to must have been very greedy, must have been clutching at gold.\nAnd the people who are talking, at the same time as they say to people, \"Renounce gold,\"\nthey say, \"Donate gold to the temples.\" Donate dust to the temples...? Donate the dust of the whole world to the temples -- will that make any sense? But, \"Donate gold.…\" And that too, Jaina monks in their scriptures say, \"Donate only to Jaina temples.\" Donating dust only to Jaina temples? Why not to Hindu temples too? Why not to Buddhist temples too? And the Buddhists go on saying the same: \"Donate only to the Buddhist temples, because they are TRUE temples.\" What difference does it make whether the temple is true or untrue? You are only donating dust! Even if you donate to the untrue temple, what is wrong with it?\nBrahmins say, \"Only donate to the brahmins.\" Jainas say, \"Only donate to the Jaina monks.\" And Buddhists say, \"Only donate to the Buddhist monks.\" All others are charlatans; THEY are the true people. That shows their real intention.\nRemember, a society is possible which will not be greedy, but that is possible not through socialism; it is possible only through the growth of capitalism, through the growth of freedom. Talented people have to be given absolute freedom to create whatsoever they can -- poetry, wealth, music. Whatsoever they can create let them create, and their creativity will raise the society to higher levels.\nCapitalism is pure freedom. Of course, everybody is not capable of creating wealth, hence it creates jealousy. But we should not be dominated by jealousy, we should not be dominated by those who are uncreative. If we are dominated by the uncreative, by the jealous, then we will destroy all the talented people. And they are the real people, they are the people who raise humanity to higher levels.\nHumanity owes all its growth to very few people, not to the masses -- not at all. The masses have been the hindrance; they are like rocks preventing the growth of society.\nSociety has been benefited only by a few scientists, a few mystics, a few creators; the others have been just hindering in every possible way. And these others constitute the majority, and of course they are jealous. But nobody says directly, \"I am jealous.\" They will talk about equality, socialism, communism...beautiful words to hide something ugly.\nPrem Vardan, whenever I say something, meditate over it. Being angry is not going to help. Anger simply shows that something in you is hurt, some wound is there. Maybe you have come believing in socialism, communism, and all that kind of nonsense. There are many sannyasins who have belonged to political ideologies in their past. When they come to me it becomes difficult for them to drop all their rubbish -- but you have to drop all your rubbish.\nIt is easy for you when I say, \"Don't be a Christian,\" because in fact you are not a Christian at all. When I say, \"Don't be a Mohammedan or a Hindu,\" who is a Mohammedan, who is a Hindu? These are only formalities. But when I say, \"Don't be a communist or a socialist,\" then it hurts more, because particularly the new generation is very much addicted to the communist ideology.\nCapitalism is not an ideology at all, that's why I prefer it. The second question:\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nI AM SEVENTY-FIVE YEARS OLD. I WANT TO BECOME A SANNYASIN, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY I AM HESITATING.\nPrakash Chandra Sethia, I think you should wait a little more! Let death come first, then I can initiate you into sannyas...because when death has already happened, there will be no hesitation: you will not be there at all. Seventy-five years old and still hesitating? One leg is already in the grave! Ninety-nine percent is almost dead. Only one percent can become a sannyasin now, and even then you are hesitating. It almost always happens with old people.\nThe people who followed Jesus were all young, almost all of them his own age. The people who followed Buddha were his age or nearabout. The same was true with Mahavira. The older a person becomes, the more cautious he becomes, and one can understand why. He has lived in the world with so many deceptive people all around. He has been deceived again and again, he has been cheated, so he becomes very cautious, hesitant. He clings to the familiar and becomes afraid of the unknown.\nBut sometimes it happens that your very cautiousness can be the most destructive thing in your life, because to be very cautious means to die before your death. It is a well-known psychological fact that people die nearabout thirty years of age. Of course, they live on afterwards, and they actually die nearabout seventy or eighty. So what are these fifty years? It is a kind of posthumous existence.\nThe gay couple were strolling down a Paris street. One kept saying to the other, \"Watch out, dearie, don't step in the doggie-doo! Watch out dearie, don't step in the doggie-doo.\nOh shit! I just stepped in the doggie-doo!\"\nMaking the other cautious, he has forgotten completely about himself!\nYou are becoming too wary, too cautious, and soon you will fall in the doggie- doo! And then it will be too late -- it is already late. It is evening time, the sun is setting. Don't waste time.\nAn old man of ninety-seven and his wife of ninety-two were appearing before the judge because they wanted a divorce.\nThe judge was very surprised. \"You're so old,\" he said. \"Why do you want to separate now, after all these years of being together?\"\nThe old man did not answer. But after some minutes his wife said very shyly, \"Your honor, we wanted to wait till all our children died.\"\nNow, Prakash Chandra Sethia, what are you waiting for -- all the children to die first?\nNow, what is the point of waiting? You have waited enough! And remember, death will not ask you, it will not even inform you, it will not even knock on your doors. It simply comes, and before you have recognized it you are finished.\nBefore death happens, let sannyas happen, because sannyas in fact has two functions. For you now it can fulfill only one function. It has two functions: the first is the art of life and the second is the art of dying. The first you have missed\n-- next time you are around don't miss it! But the second is still possible; you can learn the art of dying. You can die peacefully, silently, blissfully, surrendered to God. And in fact, the second part is far more important than the first part, because the first ultimately leads to the second. The art of life is only a preparation for the art of death.\nIf one can dance, sing and celebrate one's own death, if one can die in deep consciousness, with no complaint, with no grudge, but in immense gratitude towards God, one has fulfilled one's mission in life.\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nARE ALL DESIRES INSANE?\nNarayano, yes, all desires are insane. Desire as such is insane because desire means living in the future, and the future does not exist at all. What exists is the present.\nTo live in the present is the only sanity there is, but to live in the present you have to drop all desiring. Desire takes you away from now and here. Desire means fantasizing about the tomorrow. Desire means: \"If this happens, if I can manage this, then I will live.\" You are sacrificing the present for the future, and the present is and the future is not.\nSacrificing that which is, for that which is not, is insanity, sheer insanity.\nA high-pressure salesman for a milking-machine company seemed unable to convince a farmer to buy his appliance.\n\"There's no use talking,\" persisted the farmer, \"I've only got one cow to milk.\"\n\"But this machine will save you time in milking even one cow,\" he insisted. \"Look! It is just about milking time now. Let's go to the barn and I'll show you.\"\nIn the barn the salesman set up his machine and began the demonstration, carrying on meanwhile his persuasive flow of talk. The old man began to take a keen interest in the proceedings as he beheld the wondrous efficiency of the milker.\n\"Well, mister,\" the farmer conceded at last, \"I admit it's wonderful. I'd like mighty well to have it, but I've got no money and no way of borrowing any.\"\nHe paused and looked longingly at the shining machine. \"I tell you, though, what I'm willing to do,\" he went on, \"I'll let you take the cow as the first payment.\"\nThat's what you all are doing -- sacrificing the present for the future, sacrificing that which you have for that which you have not yet and may not have ever. The tomorrow never comes. All that comes is always today, and you can become addicted to sacrificing the today for the tomorrow. Then you will go on doing the same thing your whole life --\nalways sacrificing the now for something which is not.\nThis is how people are living. That's why their life remains a desert with no oasis; nothing flowers, nothing blossoms, no fragrance, no festivity. People look so sad, with such long faces. The whole earth seems to have suddenly turned very religious.\nEverybody looks like a saint -- so dead, so serious, so sad, that if the old saints come back to the earth they will be very much puzzled: \"What has happened? Has the whole world become saintly?\" Of course, they will find a few exceptions\n-- my sannyasins! And they will think that my sannyasins are crazy. That's what the whole world thinks about my sannyasins because they are still enjoying, living, loving, dancing, singing.\nJust the other day I received a letter from an old woman -- I loved her letter. Her son was a sannyasin and he died just two weeks ago in a car accident. She writes to me: \"I am grateful to you, because just before he died he came to see me after many many days, and he was so happy. I have never seen him so happy -- he was almost dancing. And he was so loving to me...I have never seen him so loving. There has never been such a communion between me and him. There was always something like a wall separating us, but the day he came to see me, all barriers dropped. Although he died and I will never be able to see him again, I am immensely happy and grateful to you that you had made him laugh and sing and enjoy and you had helped him to drop his seriousness. He died joyously.\"\nIt is from a mother. It is very difficult for a mother to accept the death of her son. But she could accept even the death, although she knows nothing of sannyas and she has never been here. But the one thing she understood was that something very essential had changed in the life of her son. She is not at all sad about his death. She is happy that before he died he had attained something; he had not lived in vain.\nDesires are crazy. They make you sad in two ways: if they are not fulfilled you will be sad, frustrated; if they are fulfilled you will be sad and frustrated -- in fact, more so, because when your desires are fulfilled, then you suddenly recognize that you have been chasing shadows, illusions. You have been trying to catch hold of a rainbow, and all that you find is that your hands are wet, that's all!\nPeople go on asking for the impossible; in fact, the more impossible a thing is, the more attractive it appears because it gives a challenge to your ego. The ego is not interested in the easy, it is interested in the difficult, and if it is impossible it is immensely interested.\nThe ego exists only through the difficult and the impossible. That's why the ego is not interested in God, because God is the most simple phenomenon in the world. You don't have to do anything to achieve God, because he is already inside. You don't have to do a thing. You have just to sit silently and watch and look in, and you will find him. It is so easy; that's why the ego is not interested in it at all. The ego is interested in climbing Everest. And what are you going to find there? What did Edmund Hillary find on Everest? Nobody asks him; there was nothing to find.\nI have just heard one story.…\nWhen he reached the peak of Everest, Edmund Hillary was feeling very great to be the first man to reach there. Then he suddenly saw an Indian monk squatting on the ground.\nHe was very shocked -- somebody had already reached there before him! He was so shocked he could not even say, \"Hi! How are you?\"\nBefore he could say anything, the Indian monk said, \"How much for the watch?\"\nAnd people are going to the moon! And what do you think there is on the moon? Nothing at all! They go on bringing back a few rocks. You could have gathered those rocks here, anywhere; there was no need to go so far away!\nOne story I have heard.…\nWhen the Americans reached the moon for the first time they were very puzzled, because from the other side of the moon there was such a noise. So they went to see what was happening, and there were at least ten thousand Chinese talking and talking. And when the Chinese talk, \"Ching, ching, chang, ching \"\nThe Americans were very puzzled. They said, \"What is going on? How did you manage to get here? We didn't think you had the technology yet.\"\nAnd the Chinese said, \"What technology are you talking about? There is no need for any technology. We simply went on standing upon each other and we reached! What technology? Our population is enough that we can reach any planet we decide to -- and we have only come for a holiday, a picnic!\"\nPeople are more interested in reaching Everest, the moon, Mars, than in reaching their own innermost self, because that is no challenge to the ego.\nGod is so obvious; that's why he is missed. Truth is so easily available; that's why nobody is interested in it. Nirvana is now, and the mind is not interested in now at all, it is always somewhere else.\nA long time ago in China, a mandarin had three beautiful daughters. He wished to marry them off to nobles of wealth and status. In those days a man's position in society was indicated by the number of dragons embroidered on the front of\nhis robe.\nThe mandarin called his daughters, announced his intentions and asked the eldest what kind of man she wished to marry.\n\"Oh, Daddy,\" she said, \"I'd like to marry a man with three dragons on his chest!\"\n\"Very good,\" replied the father, \"I will arrange it.\" Then turning to the second daughter he asked, \"What kind of man would YOU like?\"\n\"Oh, Daddy, get me a man with two dragons on his chest!\"\nThe father was very pleased, and turning to the youngest daughter said, \"I suppose you want to marry a man with one dragon on his chest?\"\nIn a voice charged with emotion she replied, \"Oh no, Daddy, I want a man with one draggin' on the floor!\"\nAll desires are insane!\nThe only sanity is to be desireless. The only sanity is to be herenow. This moment is more than enough. And the last question:\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nI AM A CATHOLIC NUN. CAN I ALSO BECOME A SANNYASIN?\nMary, certainly! I am here just to destroy monks and nuns; that's my very purpose for hanging around. It is to sabotage the old idea of monks and nuns, it is to bring a new kind of sannyasin into the world. The monks and nuns of all the religions -- Catholic, Protestant, Hindu, Mohammedan, Jaina, Buddhist -- have all been escapists. They are people who are basically afraid of life.\nI teach you fearlessness.\nLive as totally and passionately as possible, because it is through intense living that you will find God. God is nothing but life lived at the optimum, with total abandon, a dance danced so totally that the dancer disappears; only the dance remains. Then you have found and you have come home.\nMary, if you are a Catholic nun, then be quick! There is no time to waste, because it will take time for me to uncondition you. The Catholics condition people in a very scientific way, in a far more scientific way than Hindus and Mohammedans and Buddhists can do, because the West knows the latest methods, techniques, strategies to condition people.\nBuddhist strategies are twenty-five centuries old; Jaina strategies are even older, perhaps fifty centuries old. Christianity has been learning continuously whatsoever becomes available through psychological research, and has been trying to use all the modern methods of conditioning which have been developed by Pavlov, Skinner, Delgado and others.\nSo it will take a little longer for me to help you get rid of your nunhood. But I am also aware of the latest -- not only the latest, I am also aware of many other techniques which have not yet been developed. I have come a little ahead of my time, at least one hundred years before, so all those things can be sabotaged. I can dynamite.…\nYou are welcome. Don't hesitate at all.\nThe saints were really bored, so they sent Mary, The Holy Virgin, to Poona to see what was going on and make a daily telephone report back to them.\nThe first call was answered by Peter. \"Hello, Peter, this is Mary, The Holy Virgin. Today I dyed all my clothes orange. What do you think about it?\"\n\"That's okay,\" said Peter, \"if everybody does it.\"\nThe next call came: \"Hello, Peter, this is Mary, The Holy Virgin. Today I did Dynamic Meditation, what do you think about that?\"\n\"Well,\" responded Peter, \"if everybody does it, it's all right.\"\nOn the third day the call came: \"Hey, Peetsey Weetsey, this is Veet Mary, the Holy...um...er Ciao, bello!\"\nMary, don't waste time!\nMalcolm and Eddie were out joyriding when they smashed into a brick wall. When they arrived at the gates of Heaven, Saint Peter said to Malcolm, \"Since you were a good boy and didn't sin very much we're going to give you this new Buick to get around in up here.\"\nPeter turned to Eddie and said, \"You were not so good, my son, so you drive this Volkswagen.\"\nJust as the boys were about to get into their new cars, a big Lincoln Continental pulled up. Inside, a fat guy smoking a big cigar sat behind the wheel. He smiled and drove on.\n\"Who was that?\" Malcolm asked.\n\"Oh,\" said St. Peter, \"that was the last pope John!\"\nMalcolm and Eddie drove off in their new cars, out to tour Heaven. Later that day Malcolm saw Eddie's Volkswagen parked along the side of the road. Eddie was a little way away, rolling on the grass, laughing hysterically.\n\"What's so funny, Eddie?\"\n\"You won't believe this!\" Eddie roared. \"I just saw Jesus coming down the road on roller skates!\"\nEnough for today.\nCome, Come, Yet Again Come Chapter #6\nChapter title: A Thousand and One Ways to Laugh 1 November 1980 am in Buddha Hall\nArchive code:\n8011010\nShortTitle:\nCOME06\nAudio:\nYes Video:\nYes Length:\n0\nmins\nQ2 on video\nThe first question:\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHE OTHER DAY IN DISCOURSE YOU MENTIONED THAT WHEN A WOMAN\nWEARS RED LIPSTICK IT IS UGLY, BECAUSE IT IS NOT NATURAL. I AM\nFROM NEW YORK WHERE IT IS REQUIRED THAT WOMEN SHAVE THEIR\nLEGS, UNDERARMS, DRESS STYLISHLY, HAVE THEIR HAIR NEATLY COMBED, WEAR MAKEUP, AND ACT IN A LADYLIKE MANNER.\nYES, IT IS ALL VERY ADMIRABLE HOW YOUR SANNYASINS ARE SO\nNATURAL, BUT THE GIRLS AT THE ASHRAM DO NOT EXCITE ME. YOU SEE, NATURAL IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST OR THE MOST BEAUTIFUL.\nMY FEELING IS THAT YOU ARE SO AGAINST MAKEUP BECAUSE YOU HAVE\nNEVER SEEN GOOD MAKEUP. I AM A FREELANCE MAKEUP ARTIST AND\nWOULD LIKE TO DO A MAKEOVER ON AN ASHRAMITE SO THAT YOU CAN\nSEE HOW MAKEUP CAN BE USED TO SPIRITUALLY ENHANCE A WOMAN'S\nNATURAL BEAUTY. ANYTHING TO SAY?\nPhilip Sobel, there are many things to say. First, makeup is the invention of the ugly people. It is not that makeup is ugly, but makeup itself is the invention of the ugly. The ugly feels inferior compared to the naturally beautiful -- jealous, competitive. The ugly tries to compensate for it with artificial methods. The natural has no need to compensate.\nBut naturally beautiful people are very few; hence makeup has become almost a routine thing.\nFor thousands of years, man has been trying to hide in every possible way all that is ugly in him -- in the body, in the mind, in the soul. Even people who were naturally beautiful started imitating the ugly and the artificial, for the simple reason that the artificial can deceive. For example, breasts naturally are not as good looking as they can be made to look. Even if a woman has naturally beautiful breasts, she will start feeling that the women who have no natural beauty in their breasts can at least pretend and show that they are far more beautiful. So the naturally beautiful also start imitating.\nMakeup, and the whole idea of makeup, is basically hypocrisy. One should love and accept one's nature -- and not only on the physical level, because that is\nwhere the journey starts. If you are false there, then why not pretend the same falseness as far as mind is concerned? Then what is wrong in pretending to be a saint, a sage, when you are not? The logic will be the same. And sometimes it happens that the pretender can defeat the real, because the pretender can practice, can rehearse, can manage and manipulate in many ways.\nIt happened in the life of Charlie Chaplin.…\nOn one of his birthdays his friends arranged a competition for who could act most like Charlie Chaplin. There were going to be three prizes, and from all over the world many people participated in the competition. And the final competition was going to be held in London. Charlie Chaplin, just to have fun, entered the competition from a faraway place.\nAnd because there were so many pretenders, nobody could even see that Charlie Chaplin was part of the competition. He was certainly hoping -- in fact, he was absolutely certain\n-- that he would win the first prize and that he would have the last laugh. But it turned out otherwise. He got the second prize. Somebody else was more authentically Charlie Chaplin than Charlie Chaplin himself.\nIt is possible that a woman with makeup can, as you say, Sobel, look very beautiful. But she has to be ugly in the first place; otherwise why should she bother? And it is not that I have not seen good makeup; I have seen it. For thousands of lives what have I been doing here? Although I have not seen YOU, I have seen so many people like you that I can say many things even about you.\nThe first thing is that you must be fat. If you are not you can stand up and everybody can judge. Only fat people become interested in makeup. Secondly, you must be a \"homo,\"\nbecause only \"homos\" become interested in the artificial. And if so many beautiful women here are not turning you on, that simply means one thing: that a woman as such cannot turn you on; you need men to turn you on. In that way, homosexuality is a very great spiritual development, because heterosexuality is just natural, it is biological; homosexuality is an invention of man. The bisexual person, who is both, of course, is far more rich. He can be turned on by both men and women; he has a far richer sexuality.\nAnd from your name it is clear that you are a Jew. Now, a Jew, \"homo\" and fat...what else is needed to become a freelance makeup artist? You have all the qualifications for it.\nYou say, \"The other day in discourse you mentioned that when a woman wears red lipstick it is ugly because it is not natural.\" In the first place, that woman is ugly -- that's why she wears lipstick. If she had beautiful lips, who would bother to paint those beautiful lips with something tasteless, ugly? -- ugly in the sense that your lips are no longer part of your face. They stand out, they become separate; they are no longer an organic unity.\nI would like women to have red lips, but those red lips should come through the inner health -- through blood circulating within your body, through exercise, through breathing; through long walks, through sunbaths, lips should become red. It is beautiful to have red lips, but to pretend...! And for whom are you trying to pretend? Everybody can see the lipstick is there. The lipstick does not hide your lips, it simply reveals that something ugly is hidden behind it. And I am not saying that all that is not natural is bad. Nature CAN be improved upon. That's what intelligence is for, but it should not be against nature. For example, the lips can be red through better food, through better exercise, through better medicine. That too is improving upon nature, but improving upon nature in a natural way.\nPutting on lipstick is cheap; it is not really improving. It is good for the stage. Makeup artists are needed for the stage, not for real life. On the stage it is good, because the people who are looking at you are far away from you; they don't have to kiss you. They can throw kisses from far away; that's perfectly okay. But they don't have to taste your lipstick. Layers and layers of lipstick! It is so rotten and old, and continuously your saliva is giving it all kinds of germs. In each single kiss at least one hundred thousand germs pass between the lovers. And that is when the lips are without lipstick. With lipstick nobody has yet counted what is being transferred. And when the lipstick is there you never come in contact with the lips.\nYou must have misunderstood me. I am not saying that improving upon nature is bad. I am not saying that. Women can shave their legs and underarms. It is good, it is hygenic; nothing is wrong in it. Unless you take every care to clean your body.…\nSobel, your New York women must not be taking baths every day it seems. If you take a bath every day and clean your body, then the hairs under your arms are not bad. There is nothing wrong about it. There is no need to remove them, they have their place. But if you are not taking a bath and if you are not being hygenic and clean, then certainly they will collect dust and they will collect perspiration and they will stink. Then it is good to remove them. I am not against removing them. It is beautiful to shave the hairs on your legs and give your legs a beautiful shape.\nImprove upon nature, rather than impose. Make people more aware of their beauty and how to take care of it. Help them in natural ways. Man is the only animal who can go beyond nature, but he should go through nature, not cover nature. So I am not saying that that which is not natural is necessarily ugly.\nBut you must have misunderstood me. You must have heard with your freelance makeup artist's mind.\nOne Negro from South Africa was sent by his family to study at the university. So he went to the director to ask for admission.\n\"Which branch would you like to take?\" asked the director. \"Can't I have a desk like everybody else?\"\nNow the poor fellow is coming from Africa. His mind can understand only in his own way...!\nSex was a big problem on the American nuclear submarine which was at sea for months at a stretch. The captain, however, had solved the problem by buying a lifesize rubber doll which he put to frequent use. In fact, he became so satisfied that his crew became suspicious of his good moods and soon discovered the reason.\nWhen the captain was on the bridge, they began to sneak into his cabin to visit the doll.\nA few months later, when the submarine returned to San Francisco, the captain went along to the shop where he had originally purchased the doll.\n\"Look,\" he said, \"I want to congratulate you guys on the lifelike qualities of that\ndoll I bought. You know, it is so good I even got syphilis.\" Be natural. Try to improve upon it.\nIt is good in films, on the stage and in theater to have makeup, because people are simply looking at you -- and from a distance. You can deceive them. But when you are living with a person, in love, as a wife, as a husband, as a son, as a father, as a mother -- how can you go on deceiving? The truth will be known -- your false breasts will be discovered!\nYou can deceive others, but how can you deceive people who are close to you? And is it right to deceive them? And if they love you because of your breasts, the moment they discover that the breasts are false -- plastic or rubber -- will their love remain? It will disappear. The whole of humanity has become false. The idea seems to be to deceive, to pretend.\nI am not against your art, Sobel, but it has its own place. Life is not its place; life should be lived naturally. Yes, if some woman is so ugly, or some man is so ugly that he is disgusting, help him. Then your art can be helpful, because to be disgusting is immoral.\nWhen a woman passes by and you feel like vomiting, then certainly Philip Sobel is needed, just to protect people from falling sick!\nHe has written a letter to me in which he says that he is not turned on by any sannyasin, although they are so beautiful. But he was turned on by an Indian woman in the Blue Diamond Hotel who was wearing lipstick and everything that he would like everyone else to wear.\nMy own understanding is that people become attracted only to persons who are unavailable. Now that Indian woman is almost an impossibility for Sobel. She will not be available -- that creates attraction. Whatsoever is impossible is attractive.\nMy sannyasins are very natural people; they are not pretenders. They are open, vulnerable, available. If love knocks on their doors, they will not reject it. But there are many people who are attracted only to the impossible, for the simple reason that they cannot get it. Getting it creates troubles, so it is better to be infatuated with something you can never get.\nIndian women can be very attractive to Westerners, because they are closed, completely closed, and they are absolutely unavailable. And that very thing makes them so far away, like stars, that you can become interested. In fact it is one of the oldest strategies of women to make themselves as unavailable as possible. That creates infatuation in people, that creates sexuality in people. That keeps people tethered to the lowest kind of sexuality. Hence, people are interested in Indian women, they are interested in film actresses, because they will not be available to them. They will not be able to pay, they will not be able to afford them. They are always attracted to something which is beyond their reach. It gives them a challenge.\nMy effort here is to make this commune sexually free. And when I say sexually free, it has two meanings. In the beginning, people will be easily available to each other, and in the end the very availability will make their minds transcend sex. And that is happening every day.\nHundreds of sannyasins write to me, \"What has happened? When we came, we were so full of sex, and now all that has disappeared. There seems to be no desire for it. Even if we are interested in somebody, it is more like friendship than any sexual relationship. We love to be together, but there is no need to jump into bed immediately.\"\nIn fact, there are many sannyasins writing to me that sex has so completely disappeared, that for months or for years they have been celibate. Go and ask a Catholic monk or a Hindu sannyasin: they are trying to be celibate, and their minds are full of sex. We are not trying to be celibate here, but celibacy is happening.\nWhatsoever is easily available, automatically becomes uninteresting.\nIn the West many people are turning towards homosexuality, lesbianism, for the simple reason that a man seems for another man to be a faraway goal because he is so unnatural; a woman, for a woman, seems to be a faraway goal, it seems so unnatural. A man and woman relationship is natural. So people are turning into homosexuals, lesbians. The reason is that when you make anything difficult, condemn it, repress it, it will become more and more attractive.\nIn my commune nothing is repressed, hence everything, by and by, loses its attraction.\nOne becomes more and more calm and quiet and settled.\nYou say, Sobel, that in New York the women act in a ladylike manner. They have been forced for centuries to act in a ladylike manner. They have been changed from women into ladies. To be a woman is beautiful; to be a lady is ugly -- ugly for the simple reason that acting like a lady is phony, it is snobbish. Acting like a woman is a natural phenomenon. And of course, when you want to act like a lady then you will have to have many kinds of makeups on many planes: physical, psychological, spiritual. You will go on hiding yourself behind curtains. You will never show your real face, your authenticity.\nYou will become just a phony phenomenon.\nThe word \"phony\" is beautiful. It came into current use when telephones were invented, because when you speak on a telephone you do not sound real. It does not sound exactly like you; it becomes PHONEY. The word \"phony\" is beautiful\n-- you are not in direct contact.\nWhen I am talking to you, it is a direct contact. When it is a long-distance call, you sound phony, I sound phony. But that's how people are living. They are not allowing closeness; they are creating all kinds of barriers to create distance. Lipstick is a distance, so that lips should not come in direct contact. It gives a phoniness. All makeup is phony.\nBut let me remind you, Sobel, I am not saying that anything that is natural is good. It is not inevitably good. It can be improved upon -- it has to be improved upon. But it should be improved according to nature, not against nature. Nature should be helped to go beyond itself, it should not be repressed.\nIf nature is repressed, you start becoming schizophrenic. You start having double individualities: one that you are; one that you show to others. And you can get very messed up within yourself. Who are you? -- this or that? It is not only a question of having two personalities, you will have to have many personalities. The mother will have one personality towards the child -- she has to pretend to be a mother -- and to the husband she has to pretend to be a wife. And to the lover she has to pretend to be a lover, and so on, so forth. So she will have many personalities around herself, and in the jungle of all these personalities her own individuality will be lost. She will find it very difficult to discover her original face.\nYou say to me, \"Makeup can be used to spiritually enhance a woman's natural beauty \"\nThat is sheer nonsense. Spirituality cannot be enhanced by any makeup. Spiritual beauty has nothing to do with anything that can be done from the outside. Spirituality is your original face; it is the discovery of your intrinsic nature. It has not to be tampered with, it has not to be painted, it has not to be arranged. It has no hairs on the legs because there are no legs, no armpits, no lips.\nYour innermost being is pure consciousness. It needs no makeup.\nBut I understand Sobel's standpoint. People are even pretending there. That's what your so-called saints are doing. They are trying to cultivate spirituality. They are trying to condition themselves in a certain pattern of being holier-than- thou. But the really spiritual person is very simple, simple in the sense that he is in a natural flow; he is in a let-go with existence.\nI will not allow you, Sobel, to work on any one of my sannyasins -- not at all. It is hard work for me somehow to remove their lipstick, and somehow to make them drop their phoniness, and somehow to help them to discover their original face. I don't want you to do some makeup, and I don't see that you can make any of my sannyasins more beautiful in any way by makeup. The makeup will simply make her somebody else; she will not be herself. She may look like an actress, she may look like a model, but she will not be herself.\nMy whole effort here is to help you to be yourself, to be totally free from personalities.\nPersonality is the false thing that surrounds you, and individuality is the gift of God. It is already there inside you. If you drop your personalities, you will discover it. The moment personalities are removed, it wells up.\nRather than doing that, Philip Sobel, I can help you to be natural. If you are fat, your fatness can disappear. Become a little more loving, become a little more natural. Your fatness will disappear. Fat people are people who are in some way repressing their sexuality. Whenever you repress your sexuality, you will start eating more. That's a substitute. You will go on stuffing yourself. Hence, I suspect your Hindu monks --\nbecause they are all so fat.\nHave you seen Muktananda's guru's picture? If you have not seen it, it is worth seeing. It is a rare treat. I think he is unique -- Nityananda IS unique. You may have seen people with big bellies: Nityananda is a belly with a head! The belly is so big, you cannot say that he has a big belly. You can only say that the belly has a small man. And this is bound to happen to sexually repressed people.\nBut rationalizations.… Muktananda writes in his memoirs that when he was practicing his great SIDDHA YOGA, his KUNDALINI started rising. And what really happened he describes in detail. Not knowing anything about Freud, Jung, Adler, Wilhelm Reich...these Indian so-called gurus are absolutely uncontemporary. They don't know anything that has happened in these last one thousand years. They are at least one thousand years behind. So when he talks about kundalini, he says that his genital organs became so strong, so erect, that they started hurting; that his prick was so erect it started touching his belly button. Kundalini rising...!\nThese fools go on teaching the West that this is the kundalini rising. This is simply repressed sex and nothing else. It is such a simple fact.\nWhen the kundalini rises, something just the opposite happens.\nAn African native was bathing in the river by his village when a group of tourists arrived on the scene. They stared in awe at the enormity of his prick.\nThe native looked back at them, embarrassed, and said, \"Why is it so amusing? Don't yours shrink in cold water?\"\nWhen the kundalini rises it is taking a bath in cold water, in ice-cold water...!\nBut Nityananda's disciple cannot be anything else. Whenever you repress your sex, you will start eating more, you will become fat. You will become ugly, you will lose all proportion.\nPhilip Sobel, rather than trying makeup out on any of my sannyasins, allow some of my sannyasins to remove some fat from you. That will be far more enhancing for your spiritual beauty. And if you are not turned on by the beautiful sannyasins here, that simply shows that you have become fixed, fixated on homosexuality. Jews have suffered the longest from homosexuality -- from the\ndays of the Old Testament. Three thousand years of homosexuality -- it has become almost natural to them by now.\nLet my people help you to become a little bit natural. It is beautiful to be attracted to a woman. It is a little bit berserk to be attracted to a man; something is wrong. It never happens to the wild animals when they are in a natural state. It always happens when you put them in a zoo. In a zoo, animals start behaving homosexually.\nThe reason is that each animal needs a certain space and freedom. There is a categorical imperative: each animal needs a certain space for his territory. When that space is disturbed, he goes crazy. Then he cannot see any difference, who is who -- who is man, who is woman; who is male, who is female. He forgets all that, and he becomes so tense that he wants to release his sexual energy on anybody.\nMankind has become too overcrowded; that is creating homosexuality. The earth has become like a zoo. Nobody has space, which is an absolute necessity for growth, for natural growth. So everybody is becoming a little crazy. Homosexuality is not a good sign. It simply shows something has remained retarded in you.\nWhen a child is born, he passes through many stages. The first stage is masturbatory, because he loves himself. So every child wants to play with his genital organ; that's a natural development. Then he moves to a second phase, and that is homosexuality. The boys become interested in boys, and the girls become interested in girls. That's how friendships arise, and that's how later on you will always feel that those friendships of your childhood were something superb. Nothing like that happens again. It cannot happen; it was confined to a particular phase of your life. And if things don't go wrong, then homosexuality turns into heterosexuality. This is natural growth.\nThe child first loves himself. He is the center of his world, he does not relate with anybody else. That is dangerous, because if he remains stuck there he will never be able to get on with people. He will remain very egoistic, selfish; he will never be able to share.\nThe second step is: he moves towards the boys if he is a boy, or towards girls if she is a girl, because moving from oneself to the same sex is easier. And then\nfrom that point he can move to the opposite sex. The boy starts becoming interested in girls, the girls become interested in the boys -- that's natural growth.\nThese are the three natural phenomena. And the fourth, celibacy, is going beyond nature.\nThat is the most beautiful phenomenon.\nSo I am not saying all that is natural is beautiful, but that the transcendental should come through the natural. The natural should be transformed into the transcendental.\nCelibacy comes at the fourth stage, when you have lived with the woman or with the man, and you have gone through all the pleasures and all the pains. You have suffered, you have enjoyed, and you have become ripe enough, mature enough, to see that that too is a game -- a beautiful game, very engaging, but a game is a game. Then you start moving beyond it. Then sexuality disappears; then silence descends in you. You relate with people without any sexual idea behind it. Your relating with people then has a pure fragrance of love, and it comes more and more close to prayer.\nI am all for transcendence, Sobel, and transcendence is not natural. But I am not for artificiality. Your art can be used by my theater group, by my fashion people, by my other artists; you can be of immense help to them. But remember, it is only for the stage.\nIt is showmanship; it has nothing to do with the real life.\nThe real life has to be natural, and the real life has to go one day beyond nature. But nature has to become its foundation -- not against nature, not hiding it, but discovering the innermost core of nature. Then is the transcendence, and that is the most beautiful experience. It beautifies you, your body, your mind, your soul. It not only beautifies you, it beautifies even people who come in contact with you. This beauty belongs to the beyond; it is called grace. Something descends from the above and floods you.\nThe second question: Question 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nWHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT FOR ME TO LAUGH?\nSudheer, it must be that you have come here conditioned by wrong people. And the wrong people constitute the majority, almost ninety-nine point nine percent. The religious, the moralists, the puritans -- they are all serious people. They destroy the very possibility of laughter in you. They destroy the very sense of humor in you. To them, humor is something earthly, mundane.\nThat's why Christians say Jesus never laughed. That is absolutely wrong. I know Jesus. It is impossible that Jesus never laughed. It cannot happen. But the Christians go on believing in this -- that Jesus never laughed. Two thousand years of seriousness has made it incomprehensible that a man like Jesus can have a sense of humor.\nLook at the statues of Jesus that Christians have made. He looks so serious, as if he has been on the cross for thirty-three years. And the cross became very significant to Christianity for the simple reason that the very idea of the cross will destroy all sense of humor in you. The cross has become the symbol of their religion.\nKrishna is far closer to life. The flute is the symbol of life, not the cross. And have you seen the pictures of Krishna? Dressed beautifully, standing in a dancing posture, the flute in his hands on his lips, it looks like he is going to sing a song at any moment. He looks so alive, and he is wearing a beautiful crown of flowers with peacock feathers. This is far truer to life. That's how life is. It is tremendous joy.\nBut Buddhists say that Buddha does not even smile. And Jainas say that Mahavira has no sense of humor, cannot have. All these people are trying to create a certain idea of religiousness which is devoid of laughter. It is as if man's misery is not enough for them, and they want man to become even more miserable. They tell you, \"Carry your cross on your shoulders\" -- as if your life is not already a cross.\nSudheer, your conditioning of a wrong approach towards life is why you cannot laugh.\nBut you will have to learn laughter here, because to me laughter is one of the\nmost essential qualities of a religious man. If you cannot laugh you can never be a sage. If you cannot laugh totally, then something is missing in you. Then you have not understood the beauty of existence, you have not understood the mystery of existence.\nBodhidharma laughed for seven days when he became enlightened -- nonstop. His friends became very worried; they thought he had gone insane. They asked him, \"What is the matter? Why are you laughing?\"\nHe said, \"I am laughing because now I see the whole ridiculousness of my search. I have been searching for lives together for the truth, and it has always been within me. What I was searching for was in the seeker himself. I was looking everywhere and it was within me. I was running hither and thither and there was no need to run anywhere. I could have just calmed myself down, and it was mine. It has always been mine. From the very beginning it was within me. It is my innermost being, my very being.\n\"The seeker is the sought -- that's why I am laughing. I cannot believe how I could remain in such a deception for so long, how I managed to be such a fool. And I am also laughing because I see all around millions of people searching in the same way --\nsearching for bliss, for God, for truth, for nirvana -- and all that they are searching and seeking and looking for can be found within themselves. There is no need to go anywhere. There is no need to do anything. Just close your eyes and look within, and the kingdom of God is yours. Hence, I cannot stop laughing.\"\nThe sense of humor is very significant, particularly for my sannyasins, because I am introducing a new kind of religiousness to the world: a non-escapist religiousness, a religiousness which is not against life. I would like you to be Zorba the Greek and Gautam the Buddha together, simultaneously. Less than that won't do. Zorba represents the earth with all its flowers and greenery and mountains and rivers and oceans. Buddha represents the sky with all its stars and clouds, and the rainbows.\nThe sky without the earth will be empty. The sky cannot laugh without the earth.\nThe earth without the sky will be dead.\nBoth together -- and a dance comes into existence. The earth and the sky dancing together\n-- and there is laughter, there is joy, there is celebration.\nSudheer, look around, watch life. Don't be too bothered with religious scriptures. Ninety-nine percent of those religious scriptures are written by people who know nothing of religion. They are written by scholars, theologians. They are written by ascetics, anti-life people. The person who is anti-life is bound to be anti- laughter, anti-love -- he will be anti-everything. His whole life is nothing but a denial, a constant denial. He is suicidal, he goes on cutting himself chunk by chunk. He is destructive, he destroys himself -- how can he laugh?\nI teach you life, I teach you love, I teach you how to sing, how to dance. I teach you how to transform your life into a festival, into a carnival of delight. Hence, laughter has to be one of the most essential qualities. Even if you cry and weep, your tears should have the quality of laughter in them. They should come dancing and singing; they should not be tears of sadness and misery. They should be tears of overflowing cheerfulness, of bliss.\nThis is possible not through scriptures, but only if you look at life. All that is needed is a clarity.\nSudheer, you are an Indian -- that creates difficulty. When you look at life, inside you are reciting the BHAGAVADGITA, RAMAYANA...VEDAS are going on and on. You are chanting VISHNU SAHASTRANAM -- the one thousand names of God. How can you see life? Stop all this nonsense.\nBe silent and look at life, and you will find surprises everywhere -- each moment, on each step.\nDuring the second world war, a house in a London suburb is nearly totally destroyed by a direct hit of a rocket. All the inhabitants survive; only one man is missing. Suddenly, they hear a tremendous laughter coming out of the toilet which stands undestroyed amongst the ruins.\nThe man climbs out of it still laughing loudly, and they ask him, \"What the hell are you laughing about?\"\n\"Well,\" he says, \"isn't it funny? I pull the chain and the whole house collapses!\" Just look around and you will find a thousand and one ways to laugh.…\nLittle Siddhartha, our great sannyasin, walks up to a little girl, another sannyasin, and asks her to dance.\nShe replies, \"No, thank you.\"\nHe replies, \"Don't thank me. Thank God someone asked.\"\nA few sannyasins were talking. One asked the others, \"What is long, hard, and when put into something warm and wet, gets soft and drippy?\"\nAnd little Siddhartha answered, \"Spaghetti.\"\nThe big boss and his wife had accepted the junior executive's dinner invitation. And as dinner was being served, the little son and daughter of the host left their beds and walked through the dining room absolutely naked. The polite guests ignored them.\nAt the first opportunity, the furious father went upstairs to scold them. But before he could say anything, the little boy cried, \"Ah, Daddy, it is wonderful. We rubbed ourselves all over with Mummy's vanishing cream, and when we went downstairs to the dining room nobody saw us!\"\nIn a small German town a Catholic priest caught red-handed a young boy picking out all of the raisins from a big loaf of bread which the priest had just brought from a nearby bakery shop.\n\"Are you not ashamed, my son, picking out all the raisins from this bread?\" inquired the priest.\nThe boy looked straight at him and said, \"Firstly, I am not your son. Secondly, my mother ordered a loaf without raisins. And thirdly, I am Protestant anyway.\"\nWhile visiting Pierino's parents, a woman keeps telling them how much she would like to have a child like him, but that the stork has unfortunately not brought her anything.\nPierino says, \"Why don't you change to a cock?\"\nJust look around, Sudheer, and you will find a thousand and one things to laugh about.\nLife is full of laughter, full of ridiculousness, full of absurdities. But if you are serious you will miss all that. If you are nonserious you will be available. If you are nonserious you will be capable of seeing it.\nPaddy had died from dysentery. While they prepared the body for burial, it was still excreting. The undertaker thought carefully for a moment, then went away to get a cork.\nTwo hours later, O'Reilly and Muldoon came to carry the prepared corpse downstairs for the wake. As soft music played, the two friends solemnly carried the body down the stairs. Suddenly there was a loud pop, and a fountain of shit poured over O'Reilly's head.\nHe promptly dropped the body, which slid down the stairs into the crowd of waiting guests.\nThe undertaker rushed up to O'Reilly saying, \"What did you do, you clumsy bastard?\"\nO'Reilly looked at him coolly and said, \"Look man, if he can shit, he can fucking walk!\"\nSartini stalked into a police station and told the desk sergeant he wanted to swear out a complaint against a truck driver for assault and battery.\n\"What happened?\" asked the bored cop.\n\"I was in a phone booth, and this creep came along and wanted to use the phone,\"\nexplained Sartini. \"I told him to wait a while, but he could not. Finally, he slammed open the door and yanked me out of there.\"\n\"No wonder you got mad,\" agreed the sergeant.\n\"Damned right, I got mad,\" said the Italian. \"The son-of-a-bitch did not even give my girlfriend time to put her panties on.\"\nLady Maria's business is doing badly. As a whore in downtown Rome she tries hard, but for some reason or other it does not work out well.\nOne night she gets a great idea: \"I will buy me a few small firecrackers, and when I am making love to a guy I will set one on fire and start screaming that something inside me has been torn and he should pay extra for it.\"\nThat night she happens to meet a man and takes him to her room, where they start making love on the bed. She slips one hand under the bed and lights a firecracker. Unfortunately she lights the whole box full of fireworks, and an enormous explosion follows.\n\"Oh, oh!\" she screams, \"you hurt me inside. Ten dollars extra.\"\nThe man looks at her and groans, \"How about a hundred dollars if you can find my balls?\"\nEnough for today.\nCome, Come, Yet Again Come Chapter #7\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"12623","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/come_come_yet_again_come/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/come_come_yet_again_come/>Come, Come, Yet Again Come</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: Let Sannyas Happen</h1><div class=post-meta>60 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;12623 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Come_Come_Yet_Again_Come/part2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

YOU SAY</p><p>SANNYAS MEANS TO GET RID OF ALL CONDITIONING AND TO ESCAPE OUT</p><p>OF EVERY CAGE WHETHER IT IS RELIGIOUS, PHILOSOPHICAL OR</p><p>POLITICAL. BUT ISN'T CAPITALISM A CAGE TOO? WHY CAN'T WE LIVE A
CREATIVE LIFE IN WEALTH AND FREEDOM WITHOUT ANY "ISMS"?</p><p>Swami Prem Vardan, capitalism is not an "ism" at all; just don't get
too obsessed by the word. Sometimes words become too important to us and
we tend to forget the reality.</p><p>Capitalism is not an ideology; it is not imposed on the society, it
is a natural growth. It is not like communism, or fascism, or socialism
-- these are ideologies; they have to be imposed. Capitalism has come on
its own. In fact, the word "capitalism" has been given by the
anticapitalist thinkers: the communists, the socialists and others.
Capitalism is a state of freedom; that's exactly why I am in support of
it. It allows you all kinds of freedoms. Communism will not allow you
all kinds of freedoms; communism will give you only one ideology to
believe in -- there is no question of choice.</p><p>I am reminded of Henry Ford.…</p><p>When he made his first model, those cars were only made in one color
-- black. And he himself used to take the customers round his showroom;
he would go around with them and show them the cars. He used to say to
people, "You are free to choose any color, provided it is black!"</p><p>That's exactly the attitude of communism: you are free to choose any
ideology, any philosophy, any religion, provided it is communism. In a
communist society there is no hope for a multidimensional humanity to
grow; it can allow only a certain type to grow: it is linear. You cannot
conceive that in a communist pattern even Karl Marx would be possible;
he would not be allowed. You cannot conceive a Jesus, a Buddha, a
Krishna, or a Lao Tzu being born in a communist society; they would be
destroyed at the very beginning.</p><p>Before the Russian revolution, Russia produced the greatest novelists
in the world.</p><p>Before the revolution, Russia passed through an immense period of
creativity; it was almost an explosion. Nowhere else, in no other time,
were so many great artists born together: Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor
Dostoevsky, Anton Chekhov, Maxim Gorky, Turgenev, and many more. What
happened to all that creativity after the Russian revolution? Not a
single Tolstoy, not a single Dostoevsky, not a single</p><p>Maxim Gorky has appeared. It is impossible, because the government
directs you about what to write, what not to write.</p><p>The bureaucracy dictates everything. You cannot paint according to
your own heart, you cannot sing the song that you want to sing; you have
to dance to the tune that the government plays. Naturally, only mediocre
people have been happy in Russia.</p><p>Untalented people will find it very good, but talented people, who
are the salt of the earth, will be retarded.</p><p>Only one outlet is there, to go into politics, and that too is not
easy. Once you are in power it is very difficult for anybody else to
replace you. Joseph Stalin remained in power longer than any other
person, and he was hated by the people from their very guts, but nobody
was able to say anything. He killed more people than Genghis Khan,
Tamerlane, Nadirshah; even Adolf Hitler comes second to him. And he
killed very methodically. It is estimated that he must have killed
several million people at least, with no guilt.</p><p>The day he died and Krushchev came into power, Krushchev started
saying things against him. Even his dead body was removed from the
Kremlin, from the place where it had been ceremoniously placed. It was
dragged from the grave in a very insulting way and removed to a faraway
place which nobody visits.</p><p>Krushchev had always served Stalin as a servant, and when he started
saying things against him.… In one of the meetings of communist workers
he was talking against Stalin, and a worker shouted from the back row,
"Where were you when he was alive?</p><p>Why didn't you say these things when he was alive?"</p><p>For a moment there was a very uneasy silence. Even Krushchev could
not find any words. Then he asked, "Can I ask one thing, sir? Can you
stand up, comrade? Who has asked this question?" And Krushchev laughed
and he said, "Now you know! That's my answer!"</p><p>Communism is an "ism"; capitalism is not an "ism." Capitalism is
simply a natural phenomenon that has come on its own. There are no
capitalist philosophers, there is no capitalist party, there is no
capitalist economy which has been enforced on people; it is a
growth.</p><p>But you seem, Vardan, to be too attached to the word. Rather than
looking at the reality you have become distracted by the word
"capitalism." It simply means a state of LAISSEZ-FAIRE, a state of
freedom where one is allowed to be himself. Capitalism is not an "ism"
but a natural state of society which is capable of producing capital,
which is capable of producing wealth.</p><p>Now for sixty years or more communism has existed in Russia. Still,
communism existing in Russia has not been able to make it a rich
society; it is a poor country. Of course they go on competing as far as
war technology is concerned, but the people are poor. America is far
richer; in fact, it is the richest society that has ever existed on the
earth. Even the poorest man in America is in a far better situation than
any Russian, for the simple reason that people are allowed to produce
wealth if they choose to. If they choose not to produce wealth, if they
want to be painters, poets, they are allowed -- that is their freedom,
that is their birthright. In communism you don't have any
birthright.</p><p>And remember, equality is a very unpsychological idea. People are not
equal. Albert Einstein, Karl Marx, Gautam Buddha, Jesus, Mohammed,
Ghalib -- can you consider that these people are equal? The society
consists of thousands of types; it is beautiful because of the variety.
Communism destroys variety. It makes people in a certain pattern, it
gives them a certain structure. The whole society becomes like an army:
everybody is regimented, everybody is following a certain ideal.</p><p>Don't be too obsessed with the simple word "capitalism." But we live
in words...the very word, the mention of the word, can create anger in
you. That simply shows anger is there.</p><p>And it is a natural phenomenon, particularly when you are the
disciple of a master -- deep down you are angry at him. There are
reasons for it, because surrendering is going against your ego, and the
ego is always ready to take revenge -- any excuse will do.</p><p>Judas betrayed Jesus. Do you think he simply betrayed Jesus because
of thirty silver coins? That is not the case. Judas would not have
betrayed him for only thirty silver coins. He had lived for a long time
with Jesus, had loved him, worshipped him, was surrendered to him. Then
what came over him? And he felt immensely guilty: the day Jesus was
crucified...within twenty-four hours Judas committed suicide out of
sheer guilt.</p><p>What had he done? He could not survive, he could not live -- the
guilt was too heavy.</p><p>But nobody has looked into the psychology of Judas. So many people
have researched deeply into the psychology of Jesus, but nobody has
bothered to look into the psychology of Judas, which is worth studying
because masters are few and disciples are many, and their psychology
should be understood. And it is not the first case.…</p><p>Gautam Buddha was betrayed by his own cousin-brother who was a
disciple; Devadatta was his name. Mahavira was betrayed by his own
son-in-law who was his disciple. It is almost an inevitable phenomenon
that each master has been betrayed by somebody who was very close. Why?
There must be some hidden reason. Don't just condemn Judas; Judas is
only one of the examples.</p><p>To surrender to a master creates anger. Unwillingly you have to
surrender, finding no other way. You have tried every possible way to be
on your own, but the more efforts you have made, the deeper you have
gone into the mess. So ultimately, as a last resort, you surrender. But
the unwillingness is there. You would have been far more happy if there
had been no need to surrender. But because there is nothing else to do
-- you have done everything and it has all failed -- you need somebody's
help and support, you need somebody's guidance. And in spiritual
matters, guidance is possible only if you trust, if you surrender, if
you put your ego aside. So you put it aside, but very unwillingly,
reluctantly, and it waits for its own time to take revenge. So any small
excuse becomes a very big thing.</p><p>Now the word "capitalism" is torturing you. If you understand me,
what you are saying is exactly what I mean by capitalism.</p><p>You say: "Why can't we live a creative life in wealth and freedom
without any ìsms'?"</p><p>That's exactly what capitalism is! Drop the word "ism," find
something else. I am not much concerned with words. I am not a linguist,
not a grammarian.</p><p>Noah Webster, the lexicographer, was in his office making love to his
secretary, when Mrs. Webster walked in.</p><p>"Noah!" she gasped. "I am surprised!"</p><p>Quickly pulling his trousers up, he replied, "Not so, my dear. You
are shocked, I am surprised!"</p><p>The grammarian, the lexicographer, the linguist, is continuously
thinking of words. He is right! He says, "No, you are shocked -- you are
using the wrong word -- I am surprised!"</p><p>But it is not a question of words at all.</p><p>Don't get too obsessed with words; otherwise you will be getting
angry again and again.</p><p>If you want to be angry, that's another matter; then you can find any
excuse. And you will find a thousand and one -- I can provide you with
as many excuses as possible!</p><p>"You say sannyas means to get rid of all conditioning " Yes, and it
includes the</p><p>obsession with words too. And you say, "to escape out of every cage "
True.</p><p>Capitalism is the only state where you are not forced to live in a
cage, you are free. But capitalism is in a very dangerous state, for the
simple reason that there are only a few people who are capable of
creating wealth, and they create great jealousy in others. Those who
cannot create wealth become jealous -- and there are more of them.</p><p>Just think: if society were ruled by poets, people would be angry at
poetry, because only a few people are capable of creating poetry -- a
Shakespeare, a Milton, a Kalidas, a Rabindranath.… Only very few people
are able to create poetry, and they would be the rulers. What about the
ninety-nine point nine percent of people who are absolutely unpoetic?
They would become very angry. Or if the society were ruled by musicians,
then what about those who cannot produce music, who are not creative in
that dimension? Then Beethoven, Mozart, Wagner...a few people would be
able to dominate; they would be at the top. And what about the others?
The millions would feel angry. The same is true with capitalism: very
few people are capable of creating wealth; it is a dimension of
creativity. Not everybody is a Ford or a Morgan or a Rockefeller. This
is bound to be so.</p><p>But to understand your jealousy and to get rid of it is sannyas. To
understand your jealousy will help you tremendously to find your
dimension of creativity.</p><p>Everybody is born with a certain potential, but it is not the same
and it is good that it is not the same.</p><p>If everybody was a Shakespeare, literature would lose all joy. If
everybody was a Jesus, carrying his own cross, the whole scene would
look very crazy! And those Jesuses would go on carrying their crosses,
and who would crucify them? They would not find anyone to crucify them!
It would be a very very long and tedious journey to nowhere. They would
die natural deaths, carrying their crosses unnecessarily. It is good
that everybody is not a Jesus, not a Buddha.…</p><p>Everybody has to be himself, and capitalism simply gives you the
possibility to be yourself. Certainly you will have to prove your
mettle, you will have to work; you will have to create, you will have to
bring your total energy to a focus. But only then will you be able to
shine forth.</p><p>Capitalism is basically individualism, it is not a social structure.
It is more than that; it is just democracy and freedom. But when you
allow everybody to be himself, certainly you will feel very jealous,
because you can only be one thing and there will be many people who can
be many other things. Somebody will be a poet, somebody will be a
sculptor, somebody will be a novelist, somebody will be a musician, a
dancer, an architect, a scientist...and maybe you are just a boxer. But
there is no need to be worried -- you can be the greatest boxer in the
world! One has to look within oneself and discover one's potential.</p><p>Capitalism gives you the freedom to be yourself; that's why I support
it. My support has reasons behind it. I am not supporting it as an
economical phenomenon; there is much more involved in my support. And to
my understanding, capitalism will bring a socialism of its own kind as a
by-product, because when people have created too much wealth, what are
they going to do with it? What will you do with the wealth when you have
created it?</p><p>Albert Einstein discovers the theory of relativity, the secret of
atomic energy; then it becomes part of the whole society, then sooner or
later everybody is going to be benefited by it. A few people will create
wealth, but they will reveal the secrets of how to create wealth. Sooner
or later this whole society will be benefited by it.</p><p>A real socialism will come out of capitalism as a by-product. When
too much wealth is created, people will not be so greedy; the greed
arises only because the</p><p>wealth is very scarce. And you can see it very clearly -- you can see
it here. The poor person is very greedy, the rich person is not so
greedy. The people who are coming from the West are less greedy than the
people who are living in India. The Indians TALK about no-greed,
greedlessness, but they are the most greedy people in the world. They
have to be -- they are so poor, they have to cling.</p><p>It happens almost every day: some Western sannyasin will turn up at
the office and will say, "I would like to donate ten lakh rupees, but I
don't want my name to be mentioned because this is not such a big
thing." But no Indian turns up even with ten rupees! If you want ten
rupees from Indians you have to go to them and persuade them. Then too
it will be very difficult for them. They will give you ten rupees only
if you convince them: "You will be getting a thousandfold more in the
other world." Then they will give; otherwise not. Unless they are
convinced and you prove through the scriptures that they will get a
thousandfold, exactly a thousandfold more; unless it is a business
proposal.… And it is a really good business! You give ten rupees here,
and you get a thousandfold more there!</p><p>Where can you get that much interest? It is almost like winning a
lottery! Then it is worth risking ten rupees.</p><p>I had to stop Indians completely. I have told my office people,
"Don't accept from Indians, because we don't want money with any
conditions." They bring their conditions also -- they are donating ten
rupees, but they will bring their conditions. And these conditions have
to be fulfilled: "Osho should not say this; Osho should say this." Just
because they are donating ten rupees they want to control everything --
how sannyasins should behave, how they should move around in the
society. Just because of their ten rupees all the sannyasins have to
follow a certain moral code decided by them.</p><p>You can see it easily: the West has created enough wealth; the greed
is disappearing. But in the East, the greed has gone on increasing more
and more. In fact, because there is so much greed, people talk about
greedlessness. The saints go on teaching people, "Don't be greedy,"
because they know they are greedy; otherwise, why would they teach that?
It would be stupid to talk that way.</p><p>I have seen the most ancient scriptures. They all talk about
greedlessness, nonattachment; they all talk about nonviolence, no
stealing, no adultery. Look on everybody's wife as your mother or sister
or daughter, as the case may be...the</p><p>most ancient scriptures! All these rules of conduct prove only one
thing: that man has always been just the opposite; otherwise, why so
much fuss about committing adultery? The most ancient scriptures talk
about it: "Don't commit adultery." People must have been committing
adultery! Either the people were committing adultery or these people who
were writing the scriptures were crazy!</p><p>People must have been very greedy, because all the Jaina scriptures,
almost on every page, talk about greedlessness, as if that was the only
obsession of the people.</p><p>"Renounce," they all say; "gold is dust." If gold is dust, why
renounce it? Nobody renounces dust! Even those scriptures don't say,
"Renounce dust because dust is just gold and nothing else, so renounce
it. Don't touch dust because it is just gold." But they all talk about
renouncing gold, and in the same breath they go on saying it is dust.
They are contradicting themselves. And the people they are talking to
must have been very greedy, must have been clutching at gold.</p><p>And the people who are talking, at the same time as they say to
people, "Renounce gold,"</p><p>they say, "Donate gold to the temples." Donate dust to the
temples...? Donate the dust of the whole world to the temples -- will
that make any sense? But, "Donate gold.…" And that too, Jaina monks in
their scriptures say, "Donate only to Jaina temples." Donating dust only
to Jaina temples? Why not to Hindu temples too? Why not to Buddhist
temples too? And the Buddhists go on saying the same: "Donate only to
the Buddhist temples, because they are TRUE temples." What difference
does it make whether the temple is true or untrue? You are only donating
dust! Even if you donate to the untrue temple, what is wrong with
it?</p><p>Brahmins say, "Only donate to the brahmins." Jainas say, "Only donate
to the Jaina monks." And Buddhists say, "Only donate to the Buddhist
monks." All others are charlatans; THEY are the true people. That shows
their real intention.</p><p>Remember, a society is possible which will not be greedy, but that is
possible not through socialism; it is possible only through the growth
of capitalism, through the growth of freedom. Talented people have to be
given absolute freedom to create whatsoever they can -- poetry, wealth,
music. Whatsoever they can create let them create, and their creativity
will raise the society to higher levels.</p><p>Capitalism is pure freedom. Of course, everybody is not capable of
creating wealth, hence it creates jealousy. But we should not be
dominated by jealousy, we should not be dominated by those who are
uncreative. If we are dominated by the uncreative, by the jealous, then
we will destroy all the talented people. And they are the real people,
they are the people who raise humanity to higher levels.</p><p>Humanity owes all its growth to very few people, not to the masses --
not at all. The masses have been the hindrance; they are like rocks
preventing the growth of society.</p><p>Society has been benefited only by a few scientists, a few mystics, a
few creators; the others have been just hindering in every possible way.
And these others constitute the majority, and of course they are
jealous. But nobody says directly, "I am jealous." They will talk about
equality, socialism, communism...beautiful words to hide something
ugly.</p><p>Prem Vardan, whenever I say something, meditate over it. Being angry
is not going to help. Anger simply shows that something in you is hurt,
some wound is there. Maybe you have come believing in socialism,
communism, and all that kind of nonsense. There are many sannyasins who
have belonged to political ideologies in their past. When they come to
me it becomes difficult for them to drop all their rubbish -- but you
have to drop all your rubbish.</p><p>It is easy for you when I say, "Don't be a Christian," because in
fact you are not a Christian at all. When I say, "Don't be a Mohammedan
or a Hindu," who is a Mohammedan, who is a Hindu? These are only
formalities. But when I say, "Don't be a communist or a socialist," then
it hurts more, because particularly the new generation is very much
addicted to the communist ideology.</p><p>Capitalism is not an ideology at all, that's why I prefer it. The
second question:</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I AM SEVENTY-FIVE YEARS OLD. I WANT TO BECOME A SANNYASIN, BUT I
DON'T KNOW WHY I AM HESITATING.</p><p>Prakash Chandra Sethia, I think you should wait a little more! Let
death come first, then I can initiate you into sannyas...because when
death has already happened, there will be no hesitation: you will not be
there at all. Seventy-five years old and still hesitating? One leg is
already in the grave! Ninety-nine percent is almost dead. Only one
percent can become a sannyasin now, and even then you are hesitating. It
almost always happens with old people.</p><p>The people who followed Jesus were all young, almost all of them his
own age. The people who followed Buddha were his age or nearabout. The
same was true with Mahavira. The older a person becomes, the more
cautious he becomes, and one can understand why. He has lived in the
world with so many deceptive people all around. He has been deceived
again and again, he has been cheated, so he becomes very cautious,
hesitant. He clings to the familiar and becomes afraid of the
unknown.</p><p>But sometimes it happens that your very cautiousness can be the most
destructive thing in your life, because to be very cautious means to die
before your death. It is a well-known psychological fact that people die
nearabout thirty years of age. Of course, they live on afterwards, and
they actually die nearabout seventy or eighty. So what are these fifty
years? It is a kind of posthumous existence.</p><p>The gay couple were strolling down a Paris street. One kept saying to
the other, "Watch out, dearie, don't step in the doggie-doo! Watch out
dearie, don't step in the doggie-doo.</p><p>Oh shit! I just stepped in the doggie-doo!"</p><p>Making the other cautious, he has forgotten completely about
himself!</p><p>You are becoming too wary, too cautious, and soon you will fall in
the doggie- doo! And then it will be too late -- it is already late. It
is evening time, the sun is setting. Don't waste time.</p><p>An old man of ninety-seven and his wife of ninety-two were appearing
before the judge because they wanted a divorce.</p><p>The judge was very surprised. "You're so old," he said. "Why do you
want to separate now, after all these years of being together?"</p><p>The old man did not answer. But after some minutes his wife said very
shyly, "Your honor, we wanted to wait till all our children died."</p><p>Now, Prakash Chandra Sethia, what are you waiting for -- all the
children to die first?</p><p>Now, what is the point of waiting? You have waited enough! And
remember, death will not ask you, it will not even inform you, it will
not even knock on your doors. It simply comes, and before you have
recognized it you are finished.</p><p>Before death happens, let sannyas happen, because sannyas in fact has
two functions. For you now it can fulfill only one function. It has two
functions: the first is the art of life and the second is the art of
dying. The first you have missed</p><p>-- next time you are around don't miss it! But the second is still
possible; you can learn the art of dying. You can die peacefully,
silently, blissfully, surrendered to God. And in fact, the second part
is far more important than the first part, because the first ultimately
leads to the second. The art of life is only a preparation for the art
of death.</p><p>If one can dance, sing and celebrate one's own death, if one can die
in deep consciousness, with no complaint, with no grudge, but in immense
gratitude towards God, one has fulfilled one's mission in life.</p><p>The third question:</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>ARE ALL DESIRES INSANE?</p><p>Narayano, yes, all desires are insane. Desire as such is insane
because desire means living in the future, and the future does not exist
at all. What exists is the present.</p><p>To live in the present is the only sanity there is, but to live in
the present you have to drop all desiring. Desire takes you away from
now and here. Desire means fantasizing about the tomorrow. Desire means:
"If this happens, if I can manage this, then I will live." You are
sacrificing the present for the future, and the present is and the
future is not.</p><p>Sacrificing that which is, for that which is not, is insanity, sheer
insanity.</p><p>A high-pressure salesman for a milking-machine company seemed unable
to convince a farmer to buy his appliance.</p><p>"There's no use talking," persisted the farmer, "I've only got one
cow to milk."</p><p>"But this machine will save you time in milking even one cow," he
insisted. "Look! It is just about milking time now. Let's go to the barn
and I'll show you."</p><p>In the barn the salesman set up his machine and began the
demonstration, carrying on meanwhile his persuasive flow of talk. The
old man began to take a keen interest in the proceedings as he beheld
the wondrous efficiency of the milker.</p><p>"Well, mister," the farmer conceded at last, "I admit it's wonderful.
I'd like mighty well to have it, but I've got no money and no way of
borrowing any."</p><p>He paused and looked longingly at the shining machine. "I tell you,
though, what I'm willing to do," he went on, "I'll let you take the cow
as the first payment."</p><p>That's what you all are doing -- sacrificing the present for the
future, sacrificing that which you have for that which you have not yet
and may not have ever. The tomorrow never comes. All that comes is
always today, and you can become addicted to sacrificing the today for
the tomorrow. Then you will go on doing the same thing your whole life
--</p><p>always sacrificing the now for something which is not.</p><p>This is how people are living. That's why their life remains a desert
with no oasis; nothing flowers, nothing blossoms, no fragrance, no
festivity. People look so sad, with such long faces. The whole earth
seems to have suddenly turned very religious.</p><p>Everybody looks like a saint -- so dead, so serious, so sad, that if
the old saints come back to the earth they will be very much puzzled:
"What has happened? Has the whole world become saintly?" Of course, they
will find a few exceptions</p><p>-- my sannyasins! And they will think that my sannyasins are crazy.
That's what the whole world thinks about my sannyasins because they are
still enjoying, living, loving, dancing, singing.</p><p>Just the other day I received a letter from an old woman -- I loved
her letter. Her son was a sannyasin and he died just two weeks ago in a
car accident. She writes to me: "I am grateful to you, because just
before he died he came to see me after many many days, and he was so
happy. I have never seen him so happy -- he was almost dancing. And he
was so loving to me...I have never seen him so loving. There has never
been such a communion between me and him. There was always something
like a wall separating us, but the day he came to see me, all barriers
dropped. Although he died and I will never be able to see him again, I
am immensely happy and grateful to you that you had made him laugh and
sing and enjoy and you had helped him to drop his seriousness. He died
joyously."</p><p>It is from a mother. It is very difficult for a mother to accept the
death of her son. But she could accept even the death, although she
knows nothing of sannyas and she has never been here. But the one thing
she understood was that something very essential had changed in the life
of her son. She is not at all sad about his death. She is happy that
before he died he had attained something; he had not lived in vain.</p><p>Desires are crazy. They make you sad in two ways: if they are not
fulfilled you will be sad, frustrated; if they are fulfilled you will be
sad and frustrated -- in fact, more so, because when your desires are
fulfilled, then you suddenly recognize that you have been chasing
shadows, illusions. You have been trying to catch hold of a rainbow, and
all that you find is that your hands are wet, that's all!</p><p>People go on asking for the impossible; in fact, the more impossible
a thing is, the more attractive it appears because it gives a challenge
to your ego. The ego is not interested in the easy, it is interested in
the difficult, and if it is impossible it is immensely interested.</p><p>The ego exists only through the difficult and the impossible. That's
why the ego is not interested in God, because God is the most simple
phenomenon in the world. You don't have to do anything to achieve God,
because he is already inside. You don't have to do a thing. You have
just to sit silently and watch and look in, and you will find him. It is
so easy; that's why the ego is not interested in it at all. The ego is
interested in climbing Everest. And what are you going to find there?
What did Edmund Hillary find on Everest? Nobody asks him; there was
nothing to find.</p><p>I have just heard one story.…</p><p>When he reached the peak of Everest, Edmund Hillary was feeling very
great to be the first man to reach there. Then he suddenly saw an Indian
monk squatting on the ground.</p><p>He was very shocked -- somebody had already reached there before him!
He was so shocked he could not even say, "Hi! How are you?"</p><p>Before he could say anything, the Indian monk said, "How much for the
watch?"</p><p>And people are going to the moon! And what do you think there is on
the moon? Nothing at all! They go on bringing back a few rocks. You
could have gathered those rocks here, anywhere; there was no need to go
so far away!</p><p>One story I have heard.…</p><p>When the Americans reached the moon for the first time they were very
puzzled, because from the other side of the moon there was such a noise.
So they went to see what was happening, and there were at least ten
thousand Chinese talking and talking. And when the Chinese talk, "Ching,
ching, chang, ching "</p><p>The Americans were very puzzled. They said, "What is going on? How
did you manage to get here? We didn't think you had the technology
yet."</p><p>And the Chinese said, "What technology are you talking about? There
is no need for any technology. We simply went on standing upon each
other and we reached! What technology? Our population is enough that we
can reach any planet we decide to -- and we have only come for a
holiday, a picnic!"</p><p>People are more interested in reaching Everest, the moon, Mars, than
in reaching their own innermost self, because that is no challenge to
the ego.</p><p>God is so obvious; that's why he is missed. Truth is so easily
available; that's why nobody is interested in it. Nirvana is now, and
the mind is not interested in now at all, it is always somewhere
else.</p><p>A long time ago in China, a mandarin had three beautiful daughters.
He wished to marry them off to nobles of wealth and status. In those
days a man's position in society was indicated by the number of dragons
embroidered on the front of</p><p>his robe.</p><p>The mandarin called his daughters, announced his intentions and asked
the eldest what kind of man she wished to marry.</p><p>"Oh, Daddy," she said, "I'd like to marry a man with three dragons on
his chest!"</p><p>"Very good," replied the father, "I will arrange it." Then turning to
the second daughter he asked, "What kind of man would YOU like?"</p><p>"Oh, Daddy, get me a man with two dragons on his chest!"</p><p>The father was very pleased, and turning to the youngest daughter
said, "I suppose you want to marry a man with one dragon on his
chest?"</p><p>In a voice charged with emotion she replied, "Oh no, Daddy, I want a
man with one draggin' on the floor!"</p><p>All desires are insane!</p><p>The only sanity is to be desireless. The only sanity is to be
herenow. This moment is more than enough. And the last question:</p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I AM A CATHOLIC NUN. CAN I ALSO BECOME A SANNYASIN?</p><p>Mary, certainly! I am here just to destroy monks and nuns; that's my
very purpose for hanging around. It is to sabotage the old idea of monks
and nuns, it is to bring a new kind of sannyasin into the world. The
monks and nuns of all the religions -- Catholic, Protestant, Hindu,
Mohammedan, Jaina, Buddhist -- have all been escapists. They are people
who are basically afraid of life.</p><p>I teach you fearlessness.</p><p>Live as totally and passionately as possible, because it is through
intense living that you will find God. God is nothing but life lived at
the optimum, with total abandon, a dance danced so totally that the
dancer disappears; only the dance remains. Then you have found and you
have come home.</p><p>Mary, if you are a Catholic nun, then be quick! There is no time to
waste, because it will take time for me to uncondition you. The
Catholics condition people in a very scientific way, in a far more
scientific way than Hindus and Mohammedans and Buddhists can do, because
the West knows the latest methods, techniques, strategies to condition
people.</p><p>Buddhist strategies are twenty-five centuries old; Jaina strategies
are even older, perhaps fifty centuries old. Christianity has been
learning continuously whatsoever becomes available through psychological
research, and has been trying to use all the modern methods of
conditioning which have been developed by Pavlov, Skinner, Delgado and
others.</p><p>So it will take a little longer for me to help you get rid of your
nunhood. But I am also aware of the latest -- not only the latest, I am
also aware of many other techniques which have not yet been developed. I
have come a little ahead of my time, at least one hundred years before,
so all those things can be sabotaged. I can dynamite.…</p><p>You are welcome. Don't hesitate at all.</p><p>The saints were really bored, so they sent Mary, The Holy Virgin, to
Poona to see what was going on and make a daily telephone report back to
them.</p><p>The first call was answered by Peter. "Hello, Peter, this is Mary,
The Holy Virgin. Today I dyed all my clothes orange. What do you think
about it?"</p><p>"That's okay," said Peter, "if everybody does it."</p><p>The next call came: "Hello, Peter, this is Mary, The Holy Virgin.
Today I did Dynamic Meditation, what do you think about that?"</p><p>"Well," responded Peter, "if everybody does it, it's all right."</p><p>On the third day the call came: "Hey, Peetsey Weetsey, this is Veet
Mary, the Holy...um...er Ciao, bello!"</p><p>Mary, don't waste time!</p><p>Malcolm and Eddie were out joyriding when they smashed into a brick
wall. When they arrived at the gates of Heaven, Saint Peter said to
Malcolm, "Since you were a good boy and didn't sin very much we're going
to give you this new Buick to get around in up here."</p><p>Peter turned to Eddie and said, "You were not so good, my son, so you
drive this Volkswagen."</p><p>Just as the boys were about to get into their new cars, a big Lincoln
Continental pulled up. Inside, a fat guy smoking a big cigar sat behind
the wheel. He smiled and drove on.</p><p>"Who was that?" Malcolm asked.</p><p>"Oh," said St. Peter, "that was the last pope John!"</p><p>Malcolm and Eddie drove off in their new cars, out to tour Heaven.
Later that day Malcolm saw Eddie's Volkswagen parked along the side of
the road. Eddie was a little way away, rolling on the grass, laughing
hysterically.</p><p>"What's so funny, Eddie?"</p><p>"You won't believe this!" Eddie roared. "I just saw Jesus coming down
the road on roller skates!"</p><p>Enough for today.</p><p>Come, Come, Yet Again Come Chapter #6</p><p>Chapter title: A Thousand and One Ways to Laugh 1 November 1980 am in

I AM</p><p>FROM NEW YORK WHERE IT IS REQUIRED THAT WOMEN SHAVE THEIR</p><p>LEGS, UNDERARMS, DRESS STYLISHLY, HAVE THEIR HAIR NEATLY COMBED, WEAR
MAKEUP, AND ACT IN A LADYLIKE MANNER.</p><p>YES, IT IS ALL VERY ADMIRABLE HOW YOUR SANNYASINS ARE SO</p><p>NATURAL, BUT THE GIRLS AT THE ASHRAM DO NOT EXCITE ME. YOU SEE,
NATURAL IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST OR THE MOST BEAUTIFUL.</p><p>MY FEELING IS THAT YOU ARE SO AGAINST MAKEUP BECAUSE YOU HAVE</p><p>NEVER SEEN GOOD MAKEUP. I AM A FREELANCE MAKEUP ARTIST AND</p><p>WOULD LIKE TO DO A MAKEOVER ON AN ASHRAMITE SO THAT YOU CAN</p><p>SEE HOW MAKEUP CAN BE USED TO SPIRITUALLY ENHANCE A WOMAN'S</p><p>NATURAL BEAUTY. ANYTHING TO SAY?</p><p>Philip Sobel, there are many things to say. First, makeup is the
invention of the ugly people. It is not that makeup is ugly, but makeup
itself is the invention of the ugly. The ugly feels inferior compared to
the naturally beautiful -- jealous, competitive. The ugly tries to
compensate for it with artificial methods. The natural has no need to
compensate.</p><p>But naturally beautiful people are very few; hence makeup has become
almost a routine thing.</p><p>For thousands of years, man has been trying to hide in every possible
way all that is ugly in him -- in the body, in the mind, in the soul.
Even people who were naturally beautiful started imitating the ugly and
the artificial, for the simple reason that the artificial can deceive.
For example, breasts naturally are not as good looking as they can be
made to look. Even if a woman has naturally beautiful breasts, she will
start feeling that the women who have no natural beauty in their breasts
can at least pretend and show that they are far more beautiful. So the
naturally beautiful also start imitating.</p><p>Makeup, and the whole idea of makeup, is basically hypocrisy. One
should love and accept one's nature -- and not only on the physical
level, because that is</p><p>where the journey starts. If you are false there, then why not
pretend the same falseness as far as mind is concerned? Then what is
wrong in pretending to be a saint, a sage, when you are not? The logic
will be the same. And sometimes it happens that the pretender can defeat
the real, because the pretender can practice, can rehearse, can manage
and manipulate in many ways.</p><p>It happened in the life of Charlie Chaplin.…</p><p>On one of his birthdays his friends arranged a competition for who
could act most like Charlie Chaplin. There were going to be three
prizes, and from all over the world many people participated in the
competition. And the final competition was going to be held in London.
Charlie Chaplin, just to have fun, entered the competition from a
faraway place.</p><p>And because there were so many pretenders, nobody could even see that
Charlie Chaplin was part of the competition. He was certainly hoping --
in fact, he was absolutely certain</p><p>-- that he would win the first prize and that he would have the last
laugh. But it turned out otherwise. He got the second prize. Somebody
else was more authentically Charlie Chaplin than Charlie Chaplin
himself.</p><p>It is possible that a woman with makeup can, as you say, Sobel, look
very beautiful. But she has to be ugly in the first place; otherwise why
should she bother? And it is not that I have not seen good makeup; I
have seen it. For thousands of lives what have I been doing here?
Although I have not seen YOU, I have seen so many people like you that I
can say many things even about you.</p><p>The first thing is that you must be fat. If you are not you can stand
up and everybody can judge. Only fat people become interested in makeup.
Secondly, you must be a "homo,"</p><p>because only "homos" become interested in the artificial. And if so
many beautiful women here are not turning you on, that simply means one
thing: that a woman as such cannot turn you on; you need men to turn you
on. In that way, homosexuality is a very great spiritual development,
because heterosexuality is just natural, it is biological; homosexuality
is an invention of man. The bisexual person, who is both, of course, is
far more rich. He can be turned on by both men and women; he has a far
richer sexuality.</p><p>And from your name it is clear that you are a Jew. Now, a Jew, "homo"
and fat...what else is needed to become a freelance makeup artist? You
have all the qualifications for it.</p><p>You say, "The other day in discourse you mentioned that when a woman
wears red lipstick it is ugly because it is not natural." In the first
place, that woman is ugly -- that's why she wears lipstick. If she had
beautiful lips, who would bother to paint those beautiful lips with
something tasteless, ugly? -- ugly in the sense that your lips are no
longer part of your face. They stand out, they become separate; they are
no longer an organic unity.</p><p>I would like women to have red lips, but those red lips should come
through the inner health -- through blood circulating within your body,
through exercise, through breathing; through long walks, through
sunbaths, lips should become red. It is beautiful to have red lips, but
to pretend...! And for whom are you trying to pretend? Everybody can see
the lipstick is there. The lipstick does not hide your lips, it simply
reveals that something ugly is hidden behind it. And I am not saying
that all that is not natural is bad. Nature CAN be improved upon. That's
what intelligence is for, but it should not be against nature. For
example, the lips can be red through better food, through better
exercise, through better medicine. That too is improving upon nature,
but improving upon nature in a natural way.</p><p>Putting on lipstick is cheap; it is not really improving. It is good
for the stage. Makeup artists are needed for the stage, not for real
life. On the stage it is good, because the people who are looking at you
are far away from you; they don't have to kiss you. They can throw
kisses from far away; that's perfectly okay. But they don't have to
taste your lipstick. Layers and layers of lipstick! It is so rotten and
old, and continuously your saliva is giving it all kinds of germs. In
each single kiss at least one hundred thousand germs pass between the
lovers. And that is when the lips are without lipstick. With lipstick
nobody has yet counted what is being transferred. And when the lipstick
is there you never come in contact with the lips.</p><p>You must have misunderstood me. I am not saying that improving upon
nature is bad. I am not saying that. Women can shave their legs and
underarms. It is good, it is hygenic; nothing is wrong in it. Unless you
take every care to clean your body.…</p><p>Sobel, your New York women must not be taking baths every day it
seems. If you take a bath every day and clean your body, then the hairs
under your arms are not bad. There is nothing wrong about it. There is
no need to remove them, they have their place. But if you are not taking
a bath and if you are not being hygenic and clean, then certainly they
will collect dust and they will collect perspiration and they will
stink. Then it is good to remove them. I am not against removing them.
It is beautiful to shave the hairs on your legs and give your legs a
beautiful shape.</p><p>Improve upon nature, rather than impose. Make people more aware of
their beauty and how to take care of it. Help them in natural ways. Man
is the only animal who can go beyond nature, but he should go through
nature, not cover nature. So I am not saying that that which is not
natural is necessarily ugly.</p><p>But you must have misunderstood me. You must have heard with your
freelance makeup artist's mind.</p><p>One Negro from South Africa was sent by his family to study at the
university. So he went to the director to ask for admission.</p><p>"Which branch would you like to take?" asked the director. "Can't I
have a desk like everybody else?"</p><p>Now the poor fellow is coming from Africa. His mind can understand
only in his own way...!</p><p>Sex was a big problem on the American nuclear submarine which was at
sea for months at a stretch. The captain, however, had solved the
problem by buying a lifesize rubber doll which he put to frequent use.
In fact, he became so satisfied that his crew became suspicious of his
good moods and soon discovered the reason.</p><p>When the captain was on the bridge, they began to sneak into his
cabin to visit the doll.</p><p>A few months later, when the submarine returned to San Francisco, the
captain went along to the shop where he had originally purchased the
doll.</p><p>"Look," he said, "I want to congratulate you guys on the lifelike
qualities of that</p><p>doll I bought. You know, it is so good I even got syphilis." Be
natural. Try to improve upon it.</p><p>It is good in films, on the stage and in theater to have makeup,
because people are simply looking at you -- and from a distance. You can
deceive them. But when you are living with a person, in love, as a wife,
as a husband, as a son, as a father, as a mother -- how can you go on
deceiving? The truth will be known -- your false breasts will be
discovered!</p><p>You can deceive others, but how can you deceive people who are close
to you? And is it right to deceive them? And if they love you because of
your breasts, the moment they discover that the breasts are false --
plastic or rubber -- will their love remain? It will disappear. The
whole of humanity has become false. The idea seems to be to deceive, to
pretend.</p><p>I am not against your art, Sobel, but it has its own place. Life is
not its place; life should be lived naturally. Yes, if some woman is so
ugly, or some man is so ugly that he is disgusting, help him. Then your
art can be helpful, because to be disgusting is immoral.</p><p>When a woman passes by and you feel like vomiting, then certainly
Philip Sobel is needed, just to protect people from falling sick!</p><p>He has written a letter to me in which he says that he is not turned
on by any sannyasin, although they are so beautiful. But he was turned
on by an Indian woman in the Blue Diamond Hotel who was wearing lipstick
and everything that he would like everyone else to wear.</p><p>My own understanding is that people become attracted only to persons
who are unavailable. Now that Indian woman is almost an impossibility
for Sobel. She will not be available -- that creates attraction.
Whatsoever is impossible is attractive.</p><p>My sannyasins are very natural people; they are not pretenders. They
are open, vulnerable, available. If love knocks on their doors, they
will not reject it. But there are many people who are attracted only to
the impossible, for the simple reason that they cannot get it. Getting
it creates troubles, so it is better to be infatuated with something you
can never get.</p><p>Indian women can be very attractive to Westerners, because they are
closed, completely closed, and they are absolutely unavailable. And that
very thing makes them so far away, like stars, that you can become
interested. In fact it is one of the oldest strategies of women to make
themselves as unavailable as possible. That creates infatuation in
people, that creates sexuality in people. That keeps people tethered to
the lowest kind of sexuality. Hence, people are interested in Indian
women, they are interested in film actresses, because they will not be
available to them. They will not be able to pay, they will not be able
to afford them. They are always attracted to something which is beyond
their reach. It gives them a challenge.</p><p>My effort here is to make this commune sexually free. And when I say
sexually free, it has two meanings. In the beginning, people will be
easily available to each other, and in the end the very availability
will make their minds transcend sex. And that is happening every
day.</p><p>Hundreds of sannyasins write to me, "What has happened? When we came,
we were so full of sex, and now all that has disappeared. There seems to
be no desire for it. Even if we are interested in somebody, it is more
like friendship than any sexual relationship. We love to be together,
but there is no need to jump into bed immediately."</p><p>In fact, there are many sannyasins writing to me that sex has so
completely disappeared, that for months or for years they have been
celibate. Go and ask a Catholic monk or a Hindu sannyasin: they are
trying to be celibate, and their minds are full of sex. We are not
trying to be celibate here, but celibacy is happening.</p><p>Whatsoever is easily available, automatically becomes
uninteresting.</p><p>In the West many people are turning towards homosexuality,
lesbianism, for the simple reason that a man seems for another man to be
a faraway goal because he is so unnatural; a woman, for a woman, seems
to be a faraway goal, it seems so unnatural. A man and woman
relationship is natural. So people are turning into homosexuals,
lesbians. The reason is that when you make anything difficult, condemn
it, repress it, it will become more and more attractive.</p><p>In my commune nothing is repressed, hence everything, by and by,
loses its attraction.</p><p>One becomes more and more calm and quiet and settled.</p><p>You say, Sobel, that in New York the women act in a ladylike manner.
They have been forced for centuries to act in a ladylike manner. They
have been changed from women into ladies. To be a woman is beautiful; to
be a lady is ugly -- ugly for the simple reason that acting like a lady
is phony, it is snobbish. Acting like a woman is a natural phenomenon.
And of course, when you want to act like a lady then you will have to
have many kinds of makeups on many planes: physical, psychological,
spiritual. You will go on hiding yourself behind curtains. You will
never show your real face, your authenticity.</p><p>You will become just a phony phenomenon.</p><p>The word "phony" is beautiful. It came into current use when
telephones were invented, because when you speak on a telephone you do
not sound real. It does not sound exactly like you; it becomes PHONEY.
The word "phony" is beautiful</p><p>-- you are not in direct contact.</p><p>When I am talking to you, it is a direct contact. When it is a
long-distance call, you sound phony, I sound phony. But that's how
people are living. They are not allowing closeness; they are creating
all kinds of barriers to create distance. Lipstick is a distance, so
that lips should not come in direct contact. It gives a phoniness. All
makeup is phony.</p><p>But let me remind you, Sobel, I am not saying that anything that is
natural is good. It is not inevitably good. It can be improved upon --
it has to be improved upon. But it should be improved according to
nature, not against nature. Nature should be helped to go beyond itself,
it should not be repressed.</p><p>If nature is repressed, you start becoming schizophrenic. You start
having double individualities: one that you are; one that you show to
others. And you can get very messed up within yourself. Who are you? --
this or that? It is not only a question of having two personalities, you
will have to have many personalities. The mother will have one
personality towards the child -- she has to pretend to be a mother --
and to the husband she has to pretend to be a wife. And to the lover she
has to pretend to be a lover, and so on, so forth. So she will have many
personalities around herself, and in the jungle of all these
personalities her own individuality will be lost. She will find it very
difficult to discover her original face.</p><p>You say to me, "Makeup can be used to spiritually enhance a woman's
natural beauty "</p><p>That is sheer nonsense. Spirituality cannot be enhanced by any
makeup. Spiritual beauty has nothing to do with anything that can be
done from the outside. Spirituality is your original face; it is the
discovery of your intrinsic nature. It has not to be tampered with, it
has not to be painted, it has not to be arranged. It has no hairs on the
legs because there are no legs, no armpits, no lips.</p><p>Your innermost being is pure consciousness. It needs no makeup.</p><p>But I understand Sobel's standpoint. People are even pretending
there. That's what your so-called saints are doing. They are trying to
cultivate spirituality. They are trying to condition themselves in a
certain pattern of being holier-than- thou. But the really spiritual
person is very simple, simple in the sense that he is in a natural flow;
he is in a let-go with existence.</p><p>I will not allow you, Sobel, to work on any one of my sannyasins --
not at all. It is hard work for me somehow to remove their lipstick, and
somehow to make them drop their phoniness, and somehow to help them to
discover their original face. I don't want you to do some makeup, and I
don't see that you can make any of my sannyasins more beautiful in any
way by makeup. The makeup will simply make her somebody else; she will
not be herself. She may look like an actress, she may look like a model,
but she will not be herself.</p><p>My whole effort here is to help you to be yourself, to be totally
free from personalities.</p><p>Personality is the false thing that surrounds you, and individuality
is the gift of God. It is already there inside you. If you drop your
personalities, you will discover it. The moment personalities are
removed, it wells up.</p><p>Rather than doing that, Philip Sobel, I can help you to be natural.
If you are fat, your fatness can disappear. Become a little more loving,
become a little more natural. Your fatness will disappear. Fat people
are people who are in some way repressing their sexuality. Whenever you
repress your sexuality, you will start eating more. That's a substitute.
You will go on stuffing yourself. Hence, I suspect your Hindu monks
--</p><p>because they are all so fat.</p><p>Have you seen Muktananda's guru's picture? If you have not seen it,
it is worth seeing. It is a rare treat. I think he is unique --
Nityananda IS unique. You may have seen people with big bellies:
Nityananda is a belly with a head! The belly is so big, you cannot say
that he has a big belly. You can only say that the belly has a small
man. And this is bound to happen to sexually repressed people.</p><p>But rationalizations.… Muktananda writes in his memoirs that when he
was practicing his great SIDDHA YOGA, his KUNDALINI started rising. And
what really happened he describes in detail. Not knowing anything about
Freud, Jung, Adler, Wilhelm Reich...these Indian so-called gurus are
absolutely uncontemporary. They don't know anything that has happened in
these last one thousand years. They are at least one thousand years
behind. So when he talks about kundalini, he says that his genital
organs became so strong, so erect, that they started hurting; that his
prick was so erect it started touching his belly button. Kundalini
rising...!</p><p>These fools go on teaching the West that this is the kundalini
rising. This is simply repressed sex and nothing else. It is such a
simple fact.</p><p>When the kundalini rises, something just the opposite happens.</p><p>An African native was bathing in the river by his village when a
group of tourists arrived on the scene. They stared in awe at the
enormity of his prick.</p><p>The native looked back at them, embarrassed, and said, "Why is it so
amusing? Don't yours shrink in cold water?"</p><p>When the kundalini rises it is taking a bath in cold water, in
ice-cold water...!</p><p>But Nityananda's disciple cannot be anything else. Whenever you
repress your sex, you will start eating more, you will become fat. You
will become ugly, you will lose all proportion.</p><p>Philip Sobel, rather than trying makeup out on any of my sannyasins,
allow some of my sannyasins to remove some fat from you. That will be
far more enhancing for your spiritual beauty. And if you are not turned
on by the beautiful sannyasins here, that simply shows that you have
become fixed, fixated on homosexuality. Jews have suffered the longest
from homosexuality -- from the</p><p>days of the Old Testament. Three thousand years of homosexuality --
it has become almost natural to them by now.</p><p>Let my people help you to become a little bit natural. It is
beautiful to be attracted to a woman. It is a little bit berserk to be
attracted to a man; something is wrong. It never happens to the wild
animals when they are in a natural state. It always happens when you put
them in a zoo. In a zoo, animals start behaving homosexually.</p><p>The reason is that each animal needs a certain space and freedom.
There is a categorical imperative: each animal needs a certain space for
his territory. When that space is disturbed, he goes crazy. Then he
cannot see any difference, who is who -- who is man, who is woman; who
is male, who is female. He forgets all that, and he becomes so tense
that he wants to release his sexual energy on anybody.</p><p>Mankind has become too overcrowded; that is creating homosexuality.
The earth has become like a zoo. Nobody has space, which is an absolute
necessity for growth, for natural growth. So everybody is becoming a
little crazy. Homosexuality is not a good sign. It simply shows
something has remained retarded in you.</p><p>When a child is born, he passes through many stages. The first stage
is masturbatory, because he loves himself. So every child wants to play
with his genital organ; that's a natural development. Then he moves to a
second phase, and that is homosexuality. The boys become interested in
boys, and the girls become interested in girls. That's how friendships
arise, and that's how later on you will always feel that those
friendships of your childhood were something superb. Nothing like that
happens again. It cannot happen; it was confined to a particular phase
of your life. And if things don't go wrong, then homosexuality turns
into heterosexuality. This is natural growth.</p><p>The child first loves himself. He is the center of his world, he does
not relate with anybody else. That is dangerous, because if he remains
stuck there he will never be able to get on with people. He will remain
very egoistic, selfish; he will never be able to share.</p><p>The second step is: he moves towards the boys if he is a boy, or
towards girls if she is a girl, because moving from oneself to the same
sex is easier. And then</p><p>from that point he can move to the opposite sex. The boy starts
becoming interested in girls, the girls become interested in the boys --
that's natural growth.</p><p>These are the three natural phenomena. And the fourth, celibacy, is
going beyond nature.</p><p>That is the most beautiful phenomenon.</p><p>So I am not saying all that is natural is beautiful, but that the
transcendental should come through the natural. The natural should be
transformed into the transcendental.</p><p>Celibacy comes at the fourth stage, when you have lived with the
woman or with the man, and you have gone through all the pleasures and
all the pains. You have suffered, you have enjoyed, and you have become
ripe enough, mature enough, to see that that too is a game -- a
beautiful game, very engaging, but a game is a game. Then you start
moving beyond it. Then sexuality disappears; then silence descends in
you. You relate with people without any sexual idea behind it. Your
relating with people then has a pure fragrance of love, and it comes
more and more close to prayer.</p><p>I am all for transcendence, Sobel, and transcendence is not natural.
But I am not for artificiality. Your art can be used by my theater
group, by my fashion people, by my other artists; you can be of immense
help to them. But remember, it is only for the stage.</p><p>It is showmanship; it has nothing to do with the real life.</p><p>The real life has to be natural, and the real life has to go one day
beyond nature. But nature has to become its foundation -- not against
nature, not hiding it, but discovering the innermost core of nature.
Then is the transcendence, and that is the most beautiful experience. It
beautifies you, your body, your mind, your soul. It not only beautifies
you, it beautifies even people who come in contact with you. This beauty
belongs to the beyond; it is called grace. Something descends from the
above and floods you.</p><p>The second question: Question 2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT FOR ME TO LAUGH?</p><p>Sudheer, it must be that you have come here conditioned by wrong
people. And the wrong people constitute the majority, almost ninety-nine
point nine percent. The religious, the moralists, the puritans -- they
are all serious people. They destroy the very possibility of laughter in
you. They destroy the very sense of humor in you. To them, humor is
something earthly, mundane.</p><p>That's why Christians say Jesus never laughed. That is absolutely
wrong. I know Jesus. It is impossible that Jesus never laughed. It
cannot happen. But the Christians go on believing in this -- that Jesus
never laughed. Two thousand years of seriousness has made it
incomprehensible that a man like Jesus can have a sense of humor.</p><p>Look at the statues of Jesus that Christians have made. He looks so
serious, as if he has been on the cross for thirty-three years. And the
cross became very significant to Christianity for the simple reason that
the very idea of the cross will destroy all sense of humor in you. The
cross has become the symbol of their religion.</p><p>Krishna is far closer to life. The flute is the symbol of life, not
the cross. And have you seen the pictures of Krishna? Dressed
beautifully, standing in a dancing posture, the flute in his hands on
his lips, it looks like he is going to sing a song at any moment. He
looks so alive, and he is wearing a beautiful crown of flowers with
peacock feathers. This is far truer to life. That's how life is. It is
tremendous joy.</p><p>But Buddhists say that Buddha does not even smile. And Jainas say
that Mahavira has no sense of humor, cannot have. All these people are
trying to create a certain idea of religiousness which is devoid of
laughter. It is as if man's misery is not enough for them, and they want
man to become even more miserable. They tell you, "Carry your cross on
your shoulders" -- as if your life is not already a cross.</p><p>Sudheer, your conditioning of a wrong approach towards life is why
you cannot laugh.</p><p>But you will have to learn laughter here, because to me laughter is
one of the</p><p>most essential qualities of a religious man. If you cannot laugh you
can never be a sage. If you cannot laugh totally, then something is
missing in you. Then you have not understood the beauty of existence,
you have not understood the mystery of existence.</p><p>Bodhidharma laughed for seven days when he became enlightened --
nonstop. His friends became very worried; they thought he had gone
insane. They asked him, "What is the matter? Why are you laughing?"</p><p>He said, "I am laughing because now I see the whole ridiculousness of
my search. I have been searching for lives together for the truth, and
it has always been within me. What I was searching for was in the seeker
himself. I was looking everywhere and it was within me. I was running
hither and thither and there was no need to run anywhere. I could have
just calmed myself down, and it was mine. It has always been mine. From
the very beginning it was within me. It is my innermost being, my very
being.</p><p>"The seeker is the sought -- that's why I am laughing. I cannot
believe how I could remain in such a deception for so long, how I
managed to be such a fool. And I am also laughing because I see all
around millions of people searching in the same way --</p><p>searching for bliss, for God, for truth, for nirvana -- and all that
they are searching and seeking and looking for can be found within
themselves. There is no need to go anywhere. There is no need to do
anything. Just close your eyes and look within, and the kingdom of God
is yours. Hence, I cannot stop laughing."</p><p>The sense of humor is very significant, particularly for my
sannyasins, because I am introducing a new kind of religiousness to the
world: a non-escapist religiousness, a religiousness which is not
against life. I would like you to be Zorba the Greek and Gautam the
Buddha together, simultaneously. Less than that won't do. Zorba
represents the earth with all its flowers and greenery and mountains and
rivers and oceans. Buddha represents the sky with all its stars and
clouds, and the rainbows.</p><p>The sky without the earth will be empty. The sky cannot laugh without
the earth.</p><p>The earth without the sky will be dead.</p><p>Both together -- and a dance comes into existence. The earth and the
sky dancing together</p><p>-- and there is laughter, there is joy, there is celebration.</p><p>Sudheer, look around, watch life. Don't be too bothered with
religious scriptures. Ninety-nine percent of those religious scriptures
are written by people who know nothing of religion. They are written by
scholars, theologians. They are written by ascetics, anti-life people.
The person who is anti-life is bound to be anti- laughter, anti-love --
he will be anti-everything. His whole life is nothing but a denial, a
constant denial. He is suicidal, he goes on cutting himself chunk by
chunk. He is destructive, he destroys himself -- how can he laugh?</p><p>I teach you life, I teach you love, I teach you how to sing, how to
dance. I teach you how to transform your life into a festival, into a
carnival of delight. Hence, laughter has to be one of the most essential
qualities. Even if you cry and weep, your tears should have the quality
of laughter in them. They should come dancing and singing; they should
not be tears of sadness and misery. They should be tears of overflowing
cheerfulness, of bliss.</p><p>This is possible not through scriptures, but only if you look at
life. All that is needed is a clarity.</p><p>Sudheer, you are an Indian -- that creates difficulty. When you look
at life, inside you are reciting the BHAGAVADGITA, RAMAYANA...VEDAS are
going on and on. You are chanting VISHNU SAHASTRANAM -- the one thousand
names of God. How can you see life? Stop all this nonsense.</p><p>Be silent and look at life, and you will find surprises everywhere --
each moment, on each step.</p><p>During the second world war, a house in a London suburb is nearly
totally destroyed by a direct hit of a rocket. All the inhabitants
survive; only one man is missing. Suddenly, they hear a tremendous
laughter coming out of the toilet which stands undestroyed amongst the
ruins.</p><p>The man climbs out of it still laughing loudly, and they ask him,
"What the hell are you laughing about?"</p><p>"Well," he says, "isn't it funny? I pull the chain and the whole
house collapses!" Just look around and you will find a thousand and one
ways to laugh.…</p><p>Little Siddhartha, our great sannyasin, walks up to a little girl,
another sannyasin, and asks her to dance.</p><p>She replies, "No, thank you."</p><p>He replies, "Don't thank me. Thank God someone asked."</p><p>A few sannyasins were talking. One asked the others, "What is long,
hard, and when put into something warm and wet, gets soft and
drippy?"</p><p>And little Siddhartha answered, "Spaghetti."</p><p>The big boss and his wife had accepted the junior executive's dinner
invitation. And as dinner was being served, the little son and daughter
of the host left their beds and walked through the dining room
absolutely naked. The polite guests ignored them.</p><p>At the first opportunity, the furious father went upstairs to scold
them. But before he could say anything, the little boy cried, "Ah,
Daddy, it is wonderful. We rubbed ourselves all over with Mummy's
vanishing cream, and when we went downstairs to the dining room nobody
saw us!"</p><p>In a small German town a Catholic priest caught red-handed a young
boy picking out all of the raisins from a big loaf of bread which the
priest had just brought from a nearby bakery shop.</p><p>"Are you not ashamed, my son, picking out all the raisins from this
bread?" inquired the priest.</p><p>The boy looked straight at him and said, "Firstly, I am not your son.
Secondly, my mother ordered a loaf without raisins. And thirdly, I am
Protestant anyway."</p><p>While visiting Pierino's parents, a woman keeps telling them how much
she would like to have a child like him, but that the stork has
unfortunately not brought her anything.</p><p>Pierino says, "Why don't you change to a cock?"</p><p>Just look around, Sudheer, and you will find a thousand and one
things to laugh about.</p><p>Life is full of laughter, full of ridiculousness, full of
absurdities. But if you are serious you will miss all that. If you are
nonserious you will be available. If you are nonserious you will be
capable of seeing it.</p><p>Paddy had died from dysentery. While they prepared the body for
burial, it was still excreting. The undertaker thought carefully for a
moment, then went away to get a cork.</p><p>Two hours later, O'Reilly and Muldoon came to carry the prepared
corpse downstairs for the wake. As soft music played, the two friends
solemnly carried the body down the stairs. Suddenly there was a loud
pop, and a fountain of shit poured over O'Reilly's head.</p><p>He promptly dropped the body, which slid down the stairs into the
crowd of waiting guests.</p><p>The undertaker rushed up to O'Reilly saying, "What did you do, you
clumsy bastard?"</p><p>O'Reilly looked at him coolly and said, "Look man, if he can shit, he
can fucking walk!"</p><p>Sartini stalked into a police station and told the desk sergeant he
wanted to swear out a complaint against a truck driver for assault and
battery.</p><p>"What happened?" asked the bored cop.</p><p>"I was in a phone booth, and this creep came along and wanted to use
the phone,"</p><p>explained Sartini. "I told him to wait a while, but he could not.
Finally, he slammed open the door and yanked me out of there."</p><p>"No wonder you got mad," agreed the sergeant.</p><p>"Damned right, I got mad," said the Italian. "The son-of-a-bitch did
not even give my girlfriend time to put her panties on."</p><p>Lady Maria's business is doing badly. As a whore in downtown Rome she
tries hard, but for some reason or other it does not work out well.</p><p>One night she gets a great idea: "I will buy me a few small
firecrackers, and when I am making love to a guy I will set one on fire
and start screaming that something inside me has been torn and he should
pay extra for it."</p><p>That night she happens to meet a man and takes him to her room, where
they start making love on the bed. She slips one hand under the bed and
lights a firecracker. Unfortunately she lights the whole box full of
fireworks, and an enormous explosion follows.</p><p>"Oh, oh!" she screams, "you hurt me inside. Ten dollars extra."</p><p>The man looks at her and groans, "How about a hundred dollars if you
can find my balls?"</p><p>Enough for today.</p><p>Come, Come, Yet Again Come Chapter #7</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

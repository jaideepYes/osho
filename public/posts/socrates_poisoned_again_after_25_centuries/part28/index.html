BEING WITH YOU, I FEEL VERY FINE AND TENDER LOVE THAT MAKES ME FEEL HAPPY AND WHOLE AND FREE. IT’S SUCH A SIMPLE AND ORDINARY FEELING THAT MY MIND TELLS ME THERE MUST BE SOMETHING GREATER AND MORE INTENSE. IS THIS AGAIN MY EGO, OR IS THERE MORE TO IT?\nThe mind is always asking for more, It is a beggar. I will tell you an ancient parable...\nA beggar knocked on the doors of the palace. By chance the king was just coming out for his morning walk in the garden, so he himself opened the door. The beggar said, “It seems to be a fortunate day for you.”\nThe king said, “For me or for you?”\nThe beggar said, “By the end of the day it will be decided. I am a beggar and I ask only one thing. I have got this begging bowl; can you fill it up – with anything you like?”\nThe beggar looked a little strange. His eyes were those of a mystic; his speaking was not that of a beggar but of an emperor. His whole aura was of tremendous authority. The king ordered his prime minister to fill the beggar’s bowl with gold coins, so that he would remember that he had knocked on the door of a king, and that he was fortunate. The beggar laughed.\nThe king said, “What is the matter?”\nHe said, “By the evening everything will be decided.” His behavior was strange but very attractive too. He was a beautiful man.\nAnd then the trouble started. As the prime minister brought a bag of gold coins to fill the bowl, they all disappeared, and the bowl remained empty. More coins, more coins... all the coins that were in the treasury were brought, and they all disappeared. The whole town gathered there and the news spread like wildfire.\nThe king said, “Whatever the case, bring all the diamonds, rubies, emeralds, but fill the beggar’s bowl.” But everything disappeared in it and the bowl remained as empty as ever.\nFinally the king lost everything. It was evening. The whole day there had been great excitement all over the capital. The king was stubborn – but now there was no point, he had nothing else to give. He fell at the feet of the beggar and asked him the secret of the bowl. “Is it a magic bowl? It is evening and you have been telling me again and again, ‘By the evening, by sunset, everything will be decided.’ Now it is time. And in a way everything is decided, I have been defeated by a beggar. But you are not an ordinary beggar. All I want to know is, what is the secret of this begging bowl?”\nThe beggar said, “It is not a secret, it is something everybody knows. Just look closely at the begging bowl. It is made of the skull of a man.”\nThe king said, “I don’t understand.”\nThe beggar said, “Nobody understands. Inside the skull of man is his mind. You go on pouring everything in it and everything disappears. It is always asking for more; it is always empty. It is always a beggar, you cannot change it. You can only understand it and get rid of it.”\nThis is your situation too.\nYou were thinking that religiousness is something extraordinary, very special, is attained by very special people. It was not your thinking; this has been told to you for centuries. This is the way the whole of humanity has been deceived for thousands of years: religiousness is something so extraordinary, it happens only to special people, prophets, messiahs, saviors, incarnations of God. It is not for the ordinary and the common people. And you have accepted that conditioning. That conditioning is acceptable to the mind because it gives mind an immense scope to ask for more. It gives mind the opportunity never to be satisfied; there must be more.\nMy whole approach is that religiousness is just like freedom, just like your heartbeat. It is nothing special, it is nothing extraordinary; it is not something to be achieved – there is no question of excitement. Mind is not needed at all. If you are going to achieve something, then mind is needed, then mind’s support is needed; then mind has to think of ways and means of how to achieve it.\nBut religiousness is your nature. You are born religious. Every child is born religious; it is the society that makes him irreligious, it is the society that corrupts him. It is your religious leaders who are responsible for making the whole of humanity irreligious.\nYour religious leaders, your popes, your shankaracharyas, imams, Ayatollah Khomeini – these are all in the service of the devil. They are destroying the innocence of the child, which is the very center of religiousness. They are destroying the pure humanity of the child by making him a Jew, a Christian, a Hindu, a Buddhist. They are putting masks on the child, conditionings on his mind; and they are giving you this desire that you have to achieve religiousness – which is a rare adventure.\nYou have been befooled for centuries.\nAnd mind is in absolute cooperation with the cheaters, exploiters, because if religion is something like a goal far away, and only special and extraordinary people achieve it, then mind is very happy. That is its desire – to be special, to be somebody extraordinary, higher than others, holier than others, a saint, a prophet, a messiah. The mind is not happy with being just an ordinary and normal human being; it is ready to sacrifice everything to become extraordinary.\nBut whatever it does it can never become religious, because religion is not there, far away, as a goal. Religion is your source.\nIt is your very being.\nYou are not to achieve it, you are simply to remember it. So when I say to you, you are religious, you have only forgotten it... you have been made to forget it. Your innocence has been covered with all kinds of ugly, stupid theologies; you have been given all kinds of faces. But your original face has been lost in these artificial faces.\nYour original face is the face of the religious man. You brought it into the world; you came into the world absolutely natural, pure, innocent, loving. You came into the world playful, nonserious, enjoying the small things of the world – collecting seashells on the beach, running after butterflies, collecting flowers, colored stones – and you were so happy, as if you had found the world’s greatest treasure.\nYou had unprejudiced eyes, you had an unpolluted heart.\nHence I say again: Religiousness is only a question of remembering what has been forgotten. It is an ordinary human phenomenon. Your mind is cheating you, deceiving you still. Although you are feeling serene, you are feeling peaceful, you are feeling happy, the mind goes on saying to you, “There must be something more.” It will go on saying the same to you even if you meet God – who does not exist. The mind will say, “This god is okay, but there must be some bigger god. This god looks so normal, made in the image of man. There must be a huge god.”\nYou cannot satisfy yourself if you listen to the mind; if you don’t listen to the mind, right this very moment, contentment is yours. You can choose between the misery of the mind... because mind will always remain miserable, asking for more and more; that desire is unending.\nI had a friend who was a very rich man. He was not born rich; he was a poor man’s son, and we were friends when he was a poor man’s son. He was adopted by one of the richest families in India because they had no son. Suddenly he became the richest man in India. He should have enjoyed it. He would not have been able to attain such great riches even if he had worked for hundreds of lives. Suddenly he got it without any effort – but he was not happy. He wanted more.\nJust money was not enough, he wanted to become a great leader too. And he had the money, so he fought the election and became a member of parliament. But that was not enough. Again more: he wanted to be a cabinet minister. Because of his money he managed to become a deputy minister – but that was not enough.\nHe told me, “I want to be a cabinet minister.” I said, “Do you think that will be enough?” He said, “I think so.”\nI said, “Right now you think so. Once you become a cabinet minister, you will not think the same way.”\nHe became a cabinet minister, and immediately when he came to see me he said, “You were right. The day I became a cabinet minister my mind said to me, ‘You have come a long way. Now to be the prime minister of the country is not far away. Just a few steps more and you can become the prime minister.’ But now I am so tense, so worried, I cannot sleep, I cannot enjoy anything. While I am eating I am thinking of politics. While I am making love to my wife I am thinking of the prime ministership. Everything has become mixed up. Help me to find some peace of mind.”\nI said, “First you become prime minister. Your mind will say, ‘Now become the president of the country.’ If you go on listening to the mind, you cannot have any peace; if you want peace, stop listening to the mind. And drop all those things that you have attained by listening to the mind. As a poor man you were so happy, so joyous. You had nothing, but you had a beautiful being. I am not saying throw away your money. Just don’t let your mind dominate you. Then wherever you are you will be peaceful.”\nIf your mind dominates you, even in paradise it will say, “This is paradise? – there must be something more!” All the houses look so old and rotten and used, because they have been there for eternity. All the people look so sad and serious; they have also been there for eternity. So much dust has gathered on them, and they have nothing to do there, they have lost their dignity. They have attained paradise, but they have lost their humanness, they cannot laugh.\nLaughter is prohibited in paradise, did you know? No scripture of the world, of any religion, says that humor is a religious quality – except me. Nobody is willing to allow humor into religiousness. What will those dead, dry-as-a-bone saints be doing in paradise, can you conceive? They cannot love, they cannot play cards, they cannot even have a football match. They cannot watch television – it is so unsaintly; they cannot drink even a cup of tea, no coffee break, and no work at all... Their days are empty, their nights are empty; they must be hankering to come back to the earth. At least here they were worshiped as saints; there, nobody worships them because everybody is a saint.\nBut nobody can come back from paradise. It has an entrance, but no exit. So before entering paradise, think twice – this is going to be the last act, then you are finished. It is entering almost into your own grave. But the mind will say certainly, “This is not paradise. Find out! Look for paradise. This seems to be some mockery, the devil seems to be behind it. It seems to be a great joke to call this paradise.” Even in paradise your mind will not allow you to have peace: peace and mind don’t meet.\nOne of America’s very famous rabbis, Joshua Liebman, has written a book, PEACE OF MIND. I wrote him a letter – the book is a great seller – saying, “Whatever you know about mind seems to be rubbish. You don’t even know that peace of mind is a contradiction of terms, and that is the title of your book. The title should be, PEACE OR MIND.”\nHe must have been shocked by my letter – he never replied. I wrote to him again. “This cowardliness is not good on the part of a rabbi. Either change the title or give me the explanation.” Neither has he changed the title nor has he given me any explanation, and I have asked a simple thing. Peace of mind... such a thing does not exist.\nEither peace exists, then there is no mind, or mind exists and there is no peace. The right title would be peace or mind. But he cannot change it because that is the whole theme in the book: peace of mind, and how to attain it. He is showing methods, ways how to attain to peace of mind. The change of title will not fit with the book.\nHe can understand that I am putting him into a difficult situation; if he changes the title then the book will not fit with the title. He will have to write the whole book again, and he cannot write the whole book again because he does not understand that mind is the source of all your tensions, anxieties, worries. It cannot be peaceful, that is impossible.\nThis is the whole essence of the East’s experiments in spirituality for thousands of years: peace or mind. The choice is yours. Peace is a very normal, very ordinary, very simple phenomenon. And you are experiencing it, but by the side the mind goes on giving a commentary, “There must be something more. Don’t stop. Go on searching.”\nYou have to say to the mind, “Shut up!” It is your mind and you have the right to tell it to shut up, that you are not going to bother about its nonsense for more and more...\nEnjoy whatever you have got and the more you enjoy it the more it grows. This is the paradox: mind asks for more and more and becomes more and more worried: without mind, you live peace, you live love, you live silence. And by living it, it becomes more and more – deeper and deeper. Slowly, slowly your happiness starts having wings, starts becoming a blessing, a blissfulness, a benediction.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHIS MORNING YOU TALKED ABOUT THE MISERY IMPLANTED IN OUR MINDS BY SOCIETY, PRIESTS AND SO ON THAT IS NOT OURS. BUT HOW COULD THIS GAME DEVELOP – PRIESTS ON THE ONE HAND, PEOPLE ON THE OTHER? WHAT QUALITIES ARE THERE IN MAN SO THAT THINGS DEVELOP THIS WAY?\nIt is a very simple question. Man, as a child, is the most helpless amongst the children of all the animals. Without the father and mother the child cannot survive. He needs absolute protection, nourishment, warmth; otherwise he will shrink and die. The human child is the weakest child in the whole of existence, but his weakness is a blessing in disguise.\nBut it can also be exploited – and that’s what has been done down the centuries. The parents never allowed the weakness, helplessness and dependence of the child to turn into independence, strength, integrity, individuality; they were happy that the child remain obedient. Naturally, an obedient child is not a trouble. A disobedient child is a continuous trouble, but a disobedient child is a real human being.\nThe obedient child is just simple cow dung. A child who cannot say no has no integrity, and a child who cannot say no to something, his yes is meaningless. The yes gives meaning only when the child is capable of saying no too. Then it is up to his intelligence to decide.\nBut it is easier for parents that a child always says yes. He is rewarded for being obedient; he is punished for being disobedient. The situation is the same in the schools: the obedient child is rewarded, the disobedient is punished.\nIn my high school, for one year continuously in the ninth class, I was kept standing outside the class, not allowed to be inside. The first few days I was allowed in, but my interest was more in the trees outside, the birds, the beautiful sky changing its colors, and I was always looking out of the window.\nThe teacher told me, “If you look out of the window then I will send you out of the class. Then you can look wherever you want. But this is insulting to me; I want you to look at the board.”\nI told him, “As far as the window and board are concerned, the window is more alive, more beautiful than your blackboard with your ugly handwriting. I don’t want to see it... and don’t be worried, because whatever you are teaching I will manage in the examination.”\nThat was too much. He told me to get out of the room and stand there. Then the next day he said, “It is better that you remain outside. What is the point? – every day the same argument, and I have to send you out.”\nI said, “I am immensely grateful. You are the greatest teacher in this school. Outside the air is good, the sky is beautiful. Just behind the school is a beautiful forest. And I am at freedom; I don’t have to ask you whether I can go anywhere or not, I am already out. So I can go into the forest, I can go up to the trees, I can climb the trees – the mangoes are ripe – and who cares about your blackboard? There is no juice in you; mangoes are so sweet and so juicy.”\nHe said, “I don’t want to listen to anything – because you will corrupt the minds of others. They are also thinking of being with you outside and then who am I going to teach? You just remain silent and enjoy whatsoever you want. I will see you at the examination time.”\nI said, “Before that, I will see you.” He said, “What do you mean?”\nI said, “You will know when I see you.”\nHe used to live in a small house just a few houses away from my house. He was a bachelor, he never married; perhaps no woman ever agreed to marry him. It is better to avoid teachers as husbands and lady teachers as wives because they start behaving with you as if they are teachers.\nBefore the examinations I simply went on his roof – just by the side of his house there was a big tall tree, a peepal tree – I climbed the tree, went on his roof and removed a few tiles. He was asleep – it must have been twelve o’clock in the night – and just from the hole that I had made by removing two or three tiles, I dropped a rope.\nIn the markets there were rubber snakes available, and I had tied a rubber snake on the rope, and the snake touched his mouth once or twice. He threw it away but it came back again. Finally he had to open his eyes, and seeing a snake hanging over him, he screamed so loudly that... I have been teaching dynamic meditation for years and I never heard such a scream. I have been teaching the primal scream – but this was something even more than the primal scream.\nThe next day on the board I made a picture of the snake and wrote, “Now you have seen me, and remember it in the examination; otherwise, I am going to visit you again!”\nThe whole year I enjoyed being outside. And he gave me a hundred percent mark because he did not want me to do anything more. He was thinking, “This boy can bring anything...” He still believed that it was a real snake.\nTeachers want you to be obedient; it is easier for them to control you, to dominate you. All my teachers were complaining to my father, and my father was telling them, “Who am I to complain to? Do you think I am in power? Do you think he is going to listen to me? Do whatsoever you want to do: punish him, expel him from the school – whatsoever you want to do I absolutely agree. But don’t bother me about him, because the whole day... have I nothing else to do? Or have I just to go on listening to what he has done to this teacher, that teacher, this neighbor, that neighbor?”\nAnd he told me, “You can do anything you want, but don’t spoil my business. Everybody is coming and I think they are customers... but it turns out they are your customers.”\nI suggested to my father, “You do one thing. In your big shop, just in the corner you can write on a small board COMPLAINTS HERE in the back. You are saved... and I will see those people. Let them come.”\nHe said, “The idea is good, but have you seen in any shop a complaints box? People will think those complaints are against me and the shop; nobody will think they are against you. And you will play more mischief on those poor guys who have come in to complain.”\nI said, “It was just a suggestion to help you.”\nIt is difficult for parents, it is difficult for teachers, it is difficult for priests, it is difficult for everybody to allow any kind of disobedience. Even God – who is omnipotent, all-powerful, the greatest despot, the greatest dictator – could not allow; even he could not tolerate a small disobedience from Adam\nand Eve. They were thrown out of the Garden of Eden and they had committed no sin. In fact, hearing that it was an apple tree I have been eating apples as much as possible. I don’t see any sin arising out of eating the fruit from an apple tree.\nBut the question was not the apple tree. The question was disobedience.\nYou are asking me why it happened in the beginning. It is happening every time a child is born. Every child is a beginning. And just looking at every child’s life, you can understand the beginning of all the people who have existed on the earth.\nSo the first thing is that obedience has to be forced; for obedience, fear has to be used. That fear becomes in religious terms, hell. For obedience, reward has to be used; in religious terms, that becomes paradise or heaven. And to keep control over everything a father figure is needed – so God becomes the father.\nI know why they have not made God a mother. I know from my own experience that my mother would hide me in the house when my father was searching for me because I had done something and he was very angry. When my father would refuse to give me any money because I had done something that he had prohibited, my mother would manage to give me money. So I know that the mother cannot be such a disciplinarian as the father can be.\nAnd a mother can be persuaded very easily, because she is nothing but love, she is nothing but heart. The father is head, logic, reason, discipline. The father is man, and the society is man-made. My mother even used to enjoy it when I would come and say to her, “I have done something, and I am in urgent need of help.”\nShe would say, “But first tell me what you have done. I will save you, I will try my best, but first tell me the whole story. You bring such juicy stories that I wonder why your father gets angry. He should enjoy them.”\nThe priests, the father in heaven, the parents here on the earth, the teachers, the political leaders, they all want absolute obedience from everybody so that there is no question of any rebellion, no revolution, no change, so their vested interests are protected. We have all become victims of their vested interests. It is time that things should be changed.\nThe obedient child is always mediocre; to be disobedient means a little intelligence is needed. The obedient child becomes a good citizen, goes to the church every Sunday; the disobedient child is unreliable. What will he do in his life? He may become a painter, he may become a musician, he may become a dancer – which are not very profitable professions – or he may become just nobody, a vagabond, enjoying his freedom.\nOne of my friends, a very intelligent man I know, had a doctorate in philosophy, but he never worked. He always cheated people, borrowed money from this one and that one. He had a few things in him which attracted people: he was a good card player, a good chess player, a good drinker, things like that. He would never get drunk; you could go on giving him drink and he would remain in his senses.\nHe was a very friendly and loving person, so wherever he went he would always find friends from whom he would borrow money.\nI asked him once – because he used to come once in a while, when there was nowhere else to go he used to come to stay with me – I asked him, “How long can you manage it?”\nHe said, “You don’t know the population of the world. I never deceive the same person twice. You should appreciate my ingenuity; I have never deceived the same person again. I could have done it – but no, it is not my principle. I am a man of principle: I deceive a person only once. The world is so populated, I always find somebody else who is willing to be deceived. If nobody deceives him he will feel bad, I tell you!”\nHe is still doing that. He has become old and he has learned even more tricks. He is still doing the same, and the people he has deceived do not think badly about him, they understand him. “That man has so many qualities that if he has deceived us for a little money it is not bad. If he had worked he would have been earning more money. If he had just been a showman showing his tricks with cards and other things, like our work, he would have earned more.” Nobody felt hurt that he deceived them; in fact everybody knew that he was going to borrow money and never return it, because he had no money, no sources of income.\nI was the only person he never borrowed money from. He said, “I will not borrow money from you because there are bad days in business and I need a shelter. You are my shelter – so I can at least come to the house, and food and everything is available, and I can rest here before I find new victims.”\nSo he used to come once or twice a year and stay one or two weeks, and then he would start moving again. He had no address; all his letters used to come to my address, and they would accumulate for six or eight months. When he came I would give him the whole lot, a hundred or two hundred letters, and he would say, “Now it is too late, they have already been answered. Burn them. Why bother ... after eight months who is waiting for the reply?” He never read those letters.\nThe society is afraid. It creates fear, it creates greed, it creates ambition. And the most cunning people in the society become priests, because their business is the most cunning one.\nI used to visit a place in India called Surat. Once it was a big port; the Britishers had first landed in Surat. At that time Bombay was nothing, just a small village of fishermen, and Surat was at its peak.\nIn Surat there is a small community of Mohammedans who believe that their leader, their chief priest, is in direct connection with God. So if you want to transfer any money from this world to the other world, you give it to the priest and he will give you a note saying, “I have received one million dollars” – or something – “from this man, and it should be given to him when he reaches heaven.” The chief priest gives the note with a seal, and that note is put with the dead man when he goes into his grave.\nCan you believe that?\nI used to stay in a house that belonged to the same sect. I said, “Do you think there can be more conmanship than what this priest is doing?”\nMy friend said, “There is no conmanship; the money really reaches to the other place. People earn for their whole lives, save their money so they can have an account in the other world. And he is in direct contact...”\nI took him to the graveyard one night and I said, “Dig up a grave.” He said, “For what?”\nI said, “I want to see whether the man has taken that receipt, or if the receipt is still there. Only that will give you some sense.”\nHe said, “But it is against my religion.”\nI said, “It may be against your religion, but I can dig.” I brought out that receipt and showed him, and I told him, “The receipt is here. The bank account has not been transferred.”\nHe said, “My God, but we have all been believing.I am not alone; thousands of followers all do\nthis when they die. Before death they give as much money as they can.”\nSo one thing: the priests are the most cunning people in the world. Man, as a child, is more helpless than any animal’s child. Just join these two things – man’s helplessness and the cunningness of the priests – and this is the whole story of all your religions.\nAnd it is not just a question of what happened in the beginning. Every child is a beginning, and every child is born out of parents. Those parents are already under the control of some priesthood, of some religion, and they force the child also to be under the influence of the priest. The parents don’t have any bad intentions; they have been befooled. What has been done to them by their parents, they are doing the same to their children. Somewhere the circle has to be broken.\nI want my people to jump out of this circle. Drop all fear. There is nothing to fear. There is no hell to be worried about and there is no paradise for which you have to be greedy.\nThis life, this sun, this ocean... What more do you want?\nParadise is here. And if we drop the idea of paradise beyond death, we can make this paradise a thousandfold more beautiful.\nOnce the priest disappears, the most criminal part of humanity will have disappeared. Freedom from religions is the fundamental principle if you want to be religious. To be religious needs no fear, no greed; to be religious needs no churches, no synagogues, no temples. This whole existence is the temple.\nAll these trees – just look at the tree I am sitting under; it is a tremendously unique tree. For thousands of years its fruits have been used for weighing gold, because it is the only tree in the whole of existence which produces fruits of exactly the same weight – I think in Greek they call it\ncarob – and from carob trees has come the word ‘carat’. Gold is still weighed in carats; carob is the name of the fruit of this tree. The miracle is that thousands of fruits would come, but of exactly the same weight, so the most precious metal, gold, could be weighed using those fruits.\nExistence is so beautiful, so unique, with all these birds chirping and singing, that you need not be bothered about any paradise or any hell.\nMan has to be free of his childhood fears, his childhood greed for rewards; then religions will disappear, priests will be gone, and there will be an immense freedom to grow your individuality and your world.\nI know that within you there is something which will go on living beyond death. But it is not a concern for the moment. If you know how to live this moment, if you know how to live life, you will know how to live death and how to pass through death without any scratch.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nYESTERDAY, SOMEBODY TOLD ME I’M ACTING LIKE A CHILD AND I FELT INFERIOR. PLEASE COMMENT.\nThat’s strange. You should feel superior, not inferior. Acting like a child is a great quality.\nYes, the crowd, the mob of retarded people will think that something has gone wrong: you are acting like a child... Let them think it. But you should not be hurt by what they say.\nJust look at me. My whole life... I don’t think any man in the whole of history has been so much condemned, with so many lies, allegations, charges from all over the world. Reasonable, unreasonable, true, untrue – nothing has made me even think about them. It simply proves that we are living in an insane world.\nMy sannyasins have to be like small children – with the same joy, with the same innocence, with the same beautiful eyes, looking at the world with great excitement and ecstasy.\nDon’t be worried if people see you and you are running and catching butterflies. There is no harm. If they see you collecting colored stones on the sea beach, let them laugh.\n\u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"5716","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/socrates_poisoned_again_after_25_centuries/part28/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/socrates_poisoned_again_after_25_centuries/>Socrates Poisoned Again After 25 Centuries</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">28 Peace or mind</h1><div class=post-meta>27 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5716 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Socrates_Poisoned_Again_After_25_Centuries/part28.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part27>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p><span id=bookmark27>‌</span>CHAPTER <span class=s3>28</span></p><p><br></p><p>Peace or mind</p><p><br></p><p>5 March 1986 am in</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I USED TO THINK THAT RELIGIOUS FEELINGS WERE SOMETHING GREAT,
SOMETHING EXCITING AND EXTRAORDINARY WHICH HAPPENED TO ONLY VERY
SENSITIVE PEOPLE. BEING WITH YOU, I FEEL VERY FINE AND TENDER LOVE THAT
MAKES ME FEEL HAPPY AND WHOLE AND FREE. IT’S SUCH A SIMPLE AND ORDINARY
FEELING THAT MY MIND TELLS ME THERE MUST BE SOMETHING GREATER AND MORE
INTENSE. IS THIS AGAIN MY EGO, OR IS THERE MORE TO IT?</p><p><br></p><p>The mind is always asking for more, It is a beggar. I will tell you
an ancient parable...</p><p>A beggar knocked on the doors of the palace. By chance the king was
just coming out for his morning walk in the garden, so he himself opened
the door. The beggar said, “It seems to be a fortunate day for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, “For me or for you?”</p><p><br></p><p>The beggar said, “By the end of the day it will be decided. I am a
beggar and I ask only one thing. I have got this begging bowl; can you
fill it up – with anything you like?”</p><p>The beggar looked a little strange. His eyes were those of a mystic;
his speaking was not that of a beggar but of an emperor. His whole aura
was of tremendous authority. The king ordered his prime minister to fill
the beggar’s bowl with gold coins, so that he would remember that he had
knocked on the door of a king, and that he was fortunate. The beggar
laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, “What is the matter?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “By the evening everything will be decided.” His behavior
was strange but very attractive too. He was a beautiful man.</p><p><br></p><p>And then the trouble started. As the prime minister brought a bag of
gold coins to fill the bowl, they all disappeared, and the bowl remained
empty. More coins, more coins... all the coins that were in the treasury
were brought, and they all disappeared. The whole town gathered there
and the news spread like wildfire.</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, “Whatever the case, bring all the diamonds, rubies,
emeralds, but fill the beggar’s bowl.” But everything disappeared in it
and the bowl remained as empty as ever.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally the king lost everything. It was evening. The whole day there
had been great excitement all over the capital. The king was stubborn –
but now there was no point, he had nothing else to give. He fell at the
feet of the beggar and asked him the secret of the bowl. “Is it a magic
bowl? It is evening and you have been telling me again and again, ‘By
the evening, by sunset, everything will be decided.’ Now it is time. And
in a way everything is decided, I have been defeated by a beggar. But
you are not an ordinary beggar. All I want to know is, what is the
secret of this begging bowl?”</p><p><br></p><p>The beggar said, “It is not a secret, it is something everybody
knows. Just look closely at the begging bowl. It is made of the skull of
a man.”</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, “I don’t understand.”</p><p><br></p><p>The beggar said, “Nobody understands. Inside the skull of man is his
mind. You go on pouring everything in it and everything disappears. It
is always asking for more; it is always empty. It is always a beggar,
you cannot change it. You can only understand it and get rid of it.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is your situation too.</p><p><br></p><p>You were thinking that religiousness is something extraordinary, very
special, is attained by very special people. It was not your thinking;
this has been told to you for centuries. This is the way the whole of
humanity has been deceived for thousands of years: religiousness is
something so extraordinary, it happens only to special people, prophets,
messiahs, saviors, incarnations of God. It is not for the ordinary and
the common people. And you have accepted that conditioning. That
conditioning is acceptable to the mind because it gives mind an immense
scope to ask for more. It gives mind the opportunity never to be
satisfied; there must be more.</p><p><br></p><p>My whole approach is that religiousness is just like freedom, just
like your heartbeat. It is nothing special, it is nothing extraordinary;
it is not something to be achieved – there is no question of excitement.
Mind is not needed at all. If you are going to achieve something, then
mind is needed, then mind’s support is needed; then mind has to think of
ways and means of how to achieve it.</p><p>But religiousness is your nature. You are born religious. Every child
is born religious; it is the society that makes him irreligious, it is
the society that corrupts him. It is your religious leaders who are
responsible for making the whole of humanity irreligious.</p><p><br></p><p>Your religious leaders, your popes, your shankaracharyas, imams,
Ayatollah Khomeini – these are all in the service of the devil. They are
destroying the innocence of the child, which is the very center of
religiousness. They are destroying the pure humanity of the child by
making him a Jew, a Christian, a Hindu, a Buddhist. They are putting
masks on the child, conditionings on his mind; and they are giving you
this desire that you have to achieve religiousness – which is a rare
adventure.</p><p><br></p><p>You have been befooled for centuries.</p><p><br></p><p>And mind is in absolute cooperation with the cheaters, exploiters,
because if religion is something like a goal far away, and only special
and extraordinary people achieve it, then mind is very happy. That is
its desire – to be special, to be somebody extraordinary, higher than
others, holier than others, a saint, a prophet, a messiah. The mind is
not happy with being just an ordinary and normal human being; it is
ready to sacrifice everything to become extraordinary.</p><p><br></p><p>But whatever it does it can never become religious, because religion
is not there, far away, as a goal. Religion is your source.</p><p>It is your very being.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not to achieve it, you are simply to remember it. So when I
say to you, you are religious, you have only forgotten it... you have
been made to forget it. Your innocence has been covered with all kinds
of ugly, stupid theologies; you have been given all kinds of faces. But
your original face has been lost in these artificial faces.</p><p><br></p><p>Your original face is the face of the religious man. You brought it
into the world; you came into the world absolutely natural, pure,
innocent, loving. You came into the world playful, nonserious, enjoying
the small things of the world – collecting seashells on the beach,
running after butterflies, collecting flowers, colored stones – and you
were so happy, as if you had found the world’s greatest treasure.</p><p><br></p><p>You had unprejudiced eyes, you had an unpolluted heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence I say again: Religiousness is only a question of remembering
what has been forgotten. It is an ordinary human phenomenon. Your mind
is cheating you, deceiving you still. Although you are feeling serene,
you are feeling peaceful, you are feeling happy, the mind goes on saying
to you, “There must be something more.” It will go on saying the same to
you even if you meet God – who does not exist. The mind will say, “This
god is okay, but there must be some bigger god. This god looks so
normal, made in the image of man. There must be a huge god.”</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot satisfy yourself if you listen to the mind; if you don’t
listen to the mind, right this very moment, contentment is yours. You
can choose between the misery of the mind... because mind will always
remain miserable, asking for more and more; that desire is unending.</p><p>I had a friend who was a very rich man. He was not born rich; he was
a poor man’s son, and we were friends when he was a poor man’s son. He
was adopted by one of the richest families in India because they had no
son. Suddenly he became the richest man in India. He should have enjoyed
it. He would not have been able to attain such great riches even if he
had worked for hundreds of lives. Suddenly he got it without any effort
– but he was not happy. He wanted more.</p><p><br></p><p>Just money was not enough, he wanted to become a great leader too.
And he had the money, so he fought the election and became a member of
parliament. But that was not enough. Again more: he wanted to be a
cabinet minister. Because of his money he managed to become a deputy
minister – but that was not enough.</p><p><br></p><p>He told me, “I want to be a cabinet minister.” I said, “Do you think
that will be enough?” He said, “I think so.”</p><p>I said, “Right now you think so. Once you become a cabinet minister,
you will not think the same way.”</p><p><br></p><p>He became a cabinet minister, and immediately when he came to see me
he said, “You were right. The day I became a cabinet minister my mind
said to me, ‘You have come a long way. Now to be the prime minister of
the country is not far away. Just a few steps more and you can become
the prime minister.’ But now I am so tense, so worried, I cannot sleep,
I cannot enjoy anything. While I am eating I am thinking of politics.
While I am making love to my wife I am thinking of the prime
ministership. Everything has become mixed up. Help me to find some peace
of mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “First you become prime minister. Your mind will say, ‘Now
become the president of the country.’ If you go on listening to the
mind, you cannot have any peace; if you want peace, stop listening to
the mind. And drop all those things that you have attained by listening
to the mind. As a poor man you were so happy, so joyous. You had
nothing, but you had a beautiful being. I am not saying throw away your
money. Just don’t let your mind dominate you. Then wherever you are you
will be peaceful.”</p><p><br></p><p>If your mind dominates you, even in paradise it will say, “This is
paradise? – there must be something more!” All the houses look so old
and rotten and used, because they have been there for eternity. All the
people look so sad and serious; they have also been there for eternity.
So much dust has gathered on them, and they have nothing to do there,
they have lost their dignity. They have attained paradise, but they have
lost their humanness, they cannot laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>Laughter is prohibited in paradise, did you know? No scripture of the
world, of any religion, says that humor is a religious quality – except
me. Nobody is willing to allow humor into religiousness. What will those
dead, dry-as-a-bone saints be doing in paradise, can you conceive? They
cannot love, they cannot play cards, they cannot even have a football
match. They cannot watch television – it is so unsaintly; they cannot
drink even a cup of tea, no coffee break, and no work at all... Their
days are empty, their nights are empty; they must be hankering to come
back to the earth. At least here they were worshiped as saints; there,
nobody worships them because everybody is a saint.</p><p>But nobody can come back from paradise. It has an entrance, but no
exit. So before entering paradise, think twice – this is going to be the
last act, then you are finished. It is entering almost into your own
grave. But the mind will say certainly, “This is not paradise. Find out!
Look for paradise. This seems to be some mockery, the devil seems to be
behind it. It seems to be a great joke to call this paradise.” Even in
paradise your mind will not allow you to have peace: peace and mind
don’t meet.</p><p><br></p><p>One of America’s very famous rabbis, Joshua Liebman, has written a
book, PEACE OF MIND. I wrote him a letter – the book is a great seller –
saying, “Whatever you know about mind seems to be rubbish. You don’t
even know that peace of mind is a contradiction of terms, and that is
the title of your book. The title should be, PEACE OR MIND.”</p><p><br></p><p>He must have been shocked by my letter – he never replied. I wrote to
him again. “This cowardliness is not good on the part of a rabbi. Either
change the title or give me the explanation.” Neither has he changed the
title nor has he given me any explanation, and I have asked a simple
thing. Peace of mind... such a thing does not exist.</p><p><br></p><p>Either peace exists, then there is no mind, or mind exists and there
is no peace. The right title would be peace or mind. But he cannot
change it because that is the whole theme in the book: peace of mind,
and how to attain it. He is showing methods, ways how to attain to peace
of mind. The change of title will not fit with the book.</p><p><br></p><p>He can understand that I am putting him into a difficult situation;
if he changes the title then the book will not fit with the title. He
will have to write the whole book again, and he cannot write the whole
book again because he does not understand that mind is the source of all
your tensions, anxieties, worries. It cannot be peaceful, that is
impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the whole essence of the East’s experiments in spirituality
for thousands of years: peace or mind. The choice is yours. Peace is a
very normal, very ordinary, very simple phenomenon. And you are
experiencing it, but by the side the mind goes on giving a commentary,
“There must be something more. Don’t stop. Go on searching.”</p><p><br></p><p>You have to say to the mind, “Shut up!” It is your mind and you have
the right to tell it to shut up, that you are not going to bother about
its nonsense for more and more...</p><p><br></p><p>Enjoy whatever you have got and the more you enjoy it the more it
grows. This is the paradox: mind asks for more and more and becomes more
and more worried: without mind, you live peace, you live love, you live
silence. And by living it, it becomes more and more – deeper and deeper.
Slowly, slowly your happiness starts having wings, starts becoming a
blessing, a blissfulness, a benediction.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THIS MORNING YOU TALKED ABOUT THE MISERY IMPLANTED IN OUR MINDS BY
SOCIETY, PRIESTS AND SO ON THAT IS NOT OURS. BUT HOW COULD THIS GAME
DEVELOP – PRIESTS ON THE ONE HAND, PEOPLE ON THE OTHER? WHAT QUALITIES
ARE THERE IN MAN SO THAT THINGS DEVELOP THIS WAY?</p><p>It is a very simple question. Man, as a child, is the most helpless
amongst the children of all the animals. Without the father and mother
the child cannot survive. He needs absolute protection, nourishment,
warmth; otherwise he will shrink and die. The human child is the weakest
child in the whole of existence, but his weakness is a blessing in
disguise.</p><p><br></p><p>But it can also be exploited – and that’s what has been done down the
centuries. The parents never allowed the weakness, helplessness and
dependence of the child to turn into independence, strength, integrity,
individuality; they were happy that the child remain obedient.
Naturally, an obedient child is not a trouble. A disobedient child is a
continuous trouble, but a disobedient child is a real human being.</p><p><br></p><p>The obedient child is just simple cow dung. A child who cannot say no
has no integrity, and a child who cannot say no to something, his yes is
meaningless. The yes gives meaning only when the child is capable of
saying no too. Then it is up to his intelligence to decide.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is easier for parents that a child always says yes. He is
rewarded for being obedient; he is punished for being disobedient. The
situation is the same in the schools: the obedient child is rewarded,
the disobedient is punished.</p><p><br></p><p>In my high school, for one year continuously in the ninth class, I
was kept standing outside the class, not allowed to be inside. The first
few days I was allowed in, but my interest was more in the trees
outside, the birds, the beautiful sky changing its colors, and I was
always looking out of the window.</p><p><br></p><p>The teacher told me, “If you look out of the window then I will send
you out of the class. Then you can look wherever you want. But this is
insulting to me; I want you to look at the board.”</p><p><br></p><p>I told him, “As far as the window and board are concerned, the window
is more alive, more beautiful than your blackboard with your ugly
handwriting. I don’t want to see it... and don’t be worried, because
whatever you are teaching I will manage in the examination.”</p><p><br></p><p>That was too much. He told me to get out of the room and stand there.
Then the next day he said, “It is better that you remain outside. What
is the point? – every day the same argument, and I have to send you
out.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am immensely grateful. You are the greatest teacher in
this school. Outside the air is good, the sky is beautiful. Just behind
the school is a beautiful forest. And I am at freedom; I don’t have to
ask you whether I can go anywhere or not, I am already out. So I can go
into the forest, I can go up to the trees, I can climb the trees – the
mangoes are ripe – and who cares about your blackboard? There is no
juice in you; mangoes are so sweet and so juicy.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I don’t want to listen to anything – because you will
corrupt the minds of others. They are also thinking of being with you
outside and then who am I going to teach? You just remain silent and
enjoy whatsoever you want. I will see you at the examination time.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Before that, I will see you.” He said, “What do you
mean?”</p><p>I said, “You will know when I see you.”</p><p><br></p><p>He used to live in a small house just a few houses away from my
house. He was a bachelor, he never married; perhaps no woman ever agreed
to marry him. It is better to avoid teachers as husbands and lady
teachers as wives because they start behaving with you as if they are
teachers.</p><p><br></p><p>Before the examinations I simply went on his roof – just by the side
of his house there was a big tall tree, a peepal tree – I climbed the
tree, went on his roof and removed a few tiles. He was asleep – it must
have been twelve o’clock in the night – and just from the hole that I
had made by removing two or three tiles, I dropped a rope.</p><p><br></p><p>In the markets there were rubber snakes available, and I had tied a
rubber snake on the rope, and the snake touched his mouth once or twice.
He threw it away but it came back again. Finally he had to open his
eyes, and seeing a snake hanging over him, he screamed so loudly that...
I have been teaching dynamic meditation for years and I never heard such
a scream. I have been teaching the primal scream – but this was
something even more than the primal scream.</p><p><br></p><p>The next day on the board I made a picture of the snake and wrote,
“Now you have seen me, and remember it in the examination; otherwise, I
am going to visit you again!”</p><p><br></p><p>The whole year I enjoyed being outside. And he gave me a hundred
percent mark because he did not want me to do anything more. He was
thinking, “This boy can bring anything...” He still believed that it was
a real snake.</p><p><br></p><p>Teachers want you to be obedient; it is easier for them to control
you, to dominate you. All my teachers were complaining to my father, and
my father was telling them, “Who am I to complain to? Do you think I am
in power? Do you think he is going to listen to me? Do whatsoever you
want to do: punish him, expel him from the school – whatsoever you want
to do I absolutely agree. But don’t bother me about him, because the
whole day... have I nothing else to do? Or have I just to go on
listening to what he has done to this teacher, that teacher, this
neighbor, that neighbor?”</p><p><br></p><p>And he told me, “You can do anything you want, but don’t spoil my
business. Everybody is coming and I think they are customers... but it
turns out they are your customers.”</p><p><br></p><p>I suggested to my father, “You do one thing. In your big shop, just
in the corner you can write on a small board COMPLAINTS HERE in the
back. You are saved... and I will see those people. Let them come.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “The idea is good, but have you seen in any shop a
complaints box? People will think those complaints are against me and
the shop; nobody will think they are against you. And you will play more
mischief on those poor guys who have come in to complain.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It was just a suggestion to help you.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is difficult for parents, it is difficult for teachers, it is
difficult for priests, it is difficult for everybody to allow any kind
of disobedience. Even God – who is omnipotent, all-powerful, the
greatest despot, the greatest dictator – could not allow; even he could
not tolerate a small disobedience from Adam</p><p>and Eve. They were thrown out of the Garden of Eden and they had
committed no sin. In fact, hearing that it was an apple tree I have been
eating apples as much as possible. I don’t see any sin arising out of
eating the fruit from an apple tree.</p><p><br></p><p>But the question was not the apple tree. The question was
disobedience.</p><p>You are asking me why it happened in the beginning. It is happening
every time a child is born. Every child is a beginning. And just looking
at every child’s life, you can understand the beginning of all the
people who have existed on the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing is that obedience has to be forced; for obedience,
fear has to be used. That fear becomes in religious terms, hell. For
obedience, reward has to be used; in religious terms, that becomes
paradise or heaven. And to keep control over everything a father figure
is needed – so God becomes the father.</p><p><br></p><p>I know why they have not made God a mother. I know from my own
experience that my mother would hide me in the house when my father was
searching for me because I had done something and he was very angry.
When my father would refuse to give me any money because I had done
something that he had prohibited, my mother would manage to give me
money. So I know that the mother cannot be such a disciplinarian as the
father can be.</p><p><br></p><p>And a mother can be persuaded very easily, because she is nothing but
love, she is nothing but heart. The father is head, logic, reason,
discipline. The father is man, and the society is man-made. My mother
even used to enjoy it when I would come and say to her, “I have done
something, and I am in urgent need of help.”</p><p><br></p><p>She would say, “But first tell me what you have done. I will save
you, I will try my best, but first tell me the whole story. You bring
such juicy stories that I wonder why your father gets angry. He should
enjoy them.”</p><p><br></p><p>The priests, the father in heaven, the parents here on the earth, the
teachers, the political leaders, they all want absolute obedience from
everybody so that there is no question of any rebellion, no revolution,
no change, so their vested interests are protected. We have all become
victims of their vested interests. It is time that things should be
changed.</p><p><br></p><p>The obedient child is always mediocre; to be disobedient means a
little intelligence is needed. The obedient child becomes a good
citizen, goes to the church every Sunday; the disobedient child is
unreliable. What will he do in his life? He may become a painter, he may
become a musician, he may become a dancer – which are not very
profitable professions – or he may become just nobody, a vagabond,
enjoying his freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my friends, a very intelligent man I know, had a doctorate in
philosophy, but he never worked. He always cheated people, borrowed
money from this one and that one. He had a few things in him which
attracted people: he was a good card player, a good chess player, a good
drinker, things like that. He would never get drunk; you could go on
giving him drink and he would remain in his senses.</p><p>He was a very friendly and loving person, so wherever he went he
would always find friends from whom he would borrow money.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked him once – because he used to come once in a while, when
there was nowhere else to go he used to come to stay with me – I asked
him, “How long can you manage it?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You don’t know the population of the world. I never deceive
the same person twice. You should appreciate my ingenuity; I have never
deceived the same person again. I could have done it – but no, it is not
my principle. I am a man of principle: I deceive a person only once. The
world is so populated, I always find somebody else who is willing to be
deceived. If nobody deceives him he will feel bad, I tell you!”</p><p><br></p><p>He is still doing that. He has become old and he has learned even
more tricks. He is still doing the same, and the people he has deceived
do not think badly about him, they understand him. “That man has so many
qualities that if he has deceived us for a little money it is not bad.
If he had worked he would have been earning more money. If he had just
been a showman showing his tricks with cards and other things, like our
work, he would have earned more.” Nobody felt hurt that he deceived
them; in fact everybody knew that he was going to borrow money and never
return it, because he had no money, no sources of income.</p><p><br></p><p>I was the only person he never borrowed money from. He said, “I will
not borrow money from you because there are bad days in business and I
need a shelter. You are my shelter – so I can at least come to the
house, and food and everything is available, and I can rest here before
I find new victims.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he used to come once or twice a year and stay one or two weeks,
and then he would start moving again. He had no address; all his letters
used to come to my address, and they would accumulate for six or eight
months. When he came I would give him the whole lot, a hundred or two
hundred letters, and he would say, “Now it is too late, they have
already been answered. Burn them. Why bother ... after eight months who
is waiting for the reply?” He never read those letters.</p><p><br></p><p>The society is afraid. It creates fear, it creates greed, it creates
ambition. And the most cunning people in the society become priests,
because their business is the most cunning one.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to visit a place in India called Surat. Once it was a big
port; the Britishers had first landed in Surat. At that time Bombay was
nothing, just a small village of fishermen, and Surat was at its
peak.</p><p><br></p><p>In Surat there is a small community of Mohammedans who believe that
their leader, their chief priest, is in direct connection with God. So
if you want to transfer any money from this world to the other world,
you give it to the priest and he will give you a note saying, “I have
received one million dollars” – or something – “from this man, and it
should be given to him when he reaches heaven.” The chief priest gives
the note with a seal, and that note is put with the dead man when he
goes into his grave.</p><p><br></p><p>Can you believe that?</p><p><br></p><p>I used to stay in a house that belonged to the same sect. I said, “Do
you think there can be more conmanship than what this priest is
doing?”</p><p>My friend said, “There is no conmanship; the money really reaches to
the other place. People earn for their whole lives, save their money so
they can have an account in the other world. And he is in direct
contact...”</p><p><br></p><p>I took him to the graveyard one night and I said, “Dig up a grave.”
He said, “For what?”</p><p>I said, “I want to see whether the man has taken that receipt, or if
the receipt is still there. Only that will give you some sense.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “But it is against my religion.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It may be against your religion, but I can dig.” I brought
out that receipt and showed him, and I told him, “The receipt is here.
The bank account has not been transferred.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “My God, but we have all been believing.<span class=s4></span>I am not alone; thousands of followers all do</p><p>this when they die. Before death they give as much money as they
can.”</p><p><br></p><p>So one thing: the priests are the most cunning people in the world.
Man, as a child, is more helpless than any animal’s child. Just join
these two things – man’s helplessness and the cunningness of the priests
– and this is the whole story of all your religions.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is not just a question of what happened in the beginning.
Every child is a beginning, and every child is born out of parents.
Those parents are already under the control of some priesthood, of some
religion, and they force the child also to be under the influence of the
priest. The parents don’t have any bad intentions; they have been
befooled. What has been done to them by their parents, they are doing
the same to their children. Somewhere the circle has to be broken.</p><p><br></p><p>I want my people to jump out of this circle. Drop all fear. There is
nothing to fear. There is no hell to be worried about and there is no
paradise for which you have to be greedy.</p><p><br></p><p>This life, this sun, this ocean... What more do you want?</p><p>Paradise is here. And if we drop the idea of paradise beyond death,
we can make this paradise a thousandfold more beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>Once the priest disappears, the most criminal part of humanity will
have disappeared. Freedom from religions is the fundamental principle if
you want to be religious. To be religious needs no fear, no greed; to be
religious needs no churches, no synagogues, no temples. This whole
existence is the temple.</p><p><br></p><p>All these trees – just look at the tree I am sitting under; it is a
tremendously unique tree. For thousands of years its fruits have been
used for weighing gold, because it is the only tree in the whole of
existence which produces fruits of exactly the same weight – I think in
Greek they call it</p><p>carob – and from carob trees has come the word ‘carat’. Gold is still
weighed in carats; carob is the name of the fruit of this tree. The
miracle is that thousands of fruits would come, but of exactly the same
weight, so the most precious metal, gold, could be weighed using those
fruits.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence is so beautiful, so unique, with all these birds chirping
and singing, that you need not be bothered about any paradise or any
hell.</p><p><br></p><p>Man has to be free of his childhood fears, his childhood greed for
rewards; then religions will disappear, priests will be gone, and there
will be an immense freedom to grow your individuality and your
world.</p><p><br></p><p>I know that within you there is something which will go on living
beyond death. But it is not a concern for the moment. If you know how to
live this moment, if you know how to live life, you will know how to
live death and how to pass through death without any scratch.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YESTERDAY, SOMEBODY TOLD ME I’M ACTING LIKE A CHILD AND I FELT
INFERIOR. PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p>That’s strange. You should feel superior, not inferior. Acting like a
child is a great quality.</p><p>Yes, the crowd, the mob of retarded people will think that something
has gone wrong: you are acting like a child... Let them think it. But
you should not be hurt by what they say.</p><p><br></p><p>Just look at me. My whole life... I don’t think any man in the whole
of history has been so much condemned, with so many lies, allegations,
charges from all over the world. Reasonable, unreasonable, true, untrue
– nothing has made me even think about them. It simply proves that we
are living in an insane world.</p><p><br></p><p>My sannyasins have to be like small children – with the same joy,
with the same innocence, with the same beautiful eyes, looking at the
world with great excitement and ecstasy.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be worried if people see you and you are running and catching
butterflies. There is no harm. If they see you collecting colored stones
on the sea beach, let them laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part27>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_path_of_the_mystic/part28/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>28 Nowhere to go</span>

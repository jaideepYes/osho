DO YOU THINK THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR IS AFRAID OF YOU?
Absolutely – otherwise there is no reason to make a law that I cannot enter Germany. I have never been in Germany; I have never committed any crime against German law.

I have never been in Germany; I have never committed any crime against German law. I have not even applied for any tourist visa, so from my side there has been no question of entering Germany. It must be his own phobia.\nHe is certainly afraid; that can be said categorically. And the reason for his fear is that the German youth is deeply in love with me. The German youth is finished with the politicians. The day Adolf Hitler died an ignominious death, German politicians died for the younger generation; all politics became ugly.\nGerman priests are also afraid. They may be behind the chancellor in a joint conspiracy, because this is the first time in the whole of history that Christians are facing a man who is taking the youth, the very cream, the intelligent people, educated people, the talented people, out of their fold. Christians have been trying to do it for centuries around the world, but they have never been successful in changing the cultured, the educated, the intelligent, the talented. They have been successful only in changing the beggars, the starving, the orphans.\nTo change an orphan into a Christian or a beggar into a Christian is not much of a conversion, because the person is not going for Christianity, he is going against his poverty. The people who\nhave come to me have not come against any poverty, they have come for a spiritual search, which the church has not been able to provide. To change a Hindu into a Christian, or a Jew into a Christian, or a Buddhist into a Christian, is an easy job; it is simply changing the prisoner from one prison to another prison.\nI have taken you out of the prison into the open sky. I don’t have any prison to give to you.\nThe politicians are afraid, the religious heads are afraid – and it is a good sign. It means that we are winning and they are losing. People become afraid only when they are losing. Why should the German chancellor be so afraid? I was not coming into his country, but he is as afraid as if he is living in my country.\nI will come to Germany, because the law is absolutely illegal, criminal. My sannyasins are going to fight it in every court of law, and I will come triumphant into Germany and challenge the chancellor to face me openly before the public.\nHe has taken a very idiotic step. He will repent for it. Question 2\nTHERE IS NO WAY FOR THE PEOPLE OF EAST GERMANY TO COME TO CRETE. ARE YOU GOING TO VISIT THEM IN EAST BERLIN?\nI have many sannyasins in East Berlin – and very brave people. They wanted to make a commune in East Berlin; I had to stop them. I had to tell them, “Remain underground.” The same is true about the Soviet Union. I have thousands of sannyasins who are underground.\nThe KGB has been able to find out about two hundred sannyasins and they are persecuting them, harassing them. They have taken their books, they have taken their tapes, they have taken their videos. But there is nothing that they can say is against... I stand for a higher communism than the Soviet Union stands for. According to me the Soviet Union is not communist yet.\nThe rich and the poor, the old classes, are no longer there, but now a bigger distance between people has arisen: the bureaucrats, the people who have power, and the people who don’t have any power. The rich were never so powerful, and the poor were always able – if they had talent and intelligence – to move into higher strata of society. But in Russia there is no movement possible, it is a static society, a dead society.\nI love the idea of communism, but a communism can only be true, authentic, when it is based on anarchism. If it is based on the dictatorship of the proletariat, it is not going to be authentic communism. It will be simply poverty distributed equally.\nI would like no poverty at all; all the people should be rich in every possible way. My communism means equal opportunity for everybody to be unique and unequal – because psychologically nobody is equal, and if you want them to be equal you have to force them to be equal. And any equality\nwhich is dependent on force is not worth the name. You have to take all freedom, you have to take all individuality. You have to sacrifice the real individual at the feet of an unreal society.\nThe society does not exist – it is only a name. If you search for society you will not find it anywhere. Wherever you will go, you will come across individuals. My communism is individualistic, and my communism is anarchistic.\nI would love to go to East Berlin. Right now they allow me at least to pass on the road. I will use that opportunity – my people can meet me on the road.\nAnd the number of sannyasins will be growing faster in Russia for a psychological reason: for seventy years Russian people have been denied every spiritual urge. It is going to explode any day.\nThe Russian youth is burning with a desire to know more about the mysteries of life, not only about materialism, which is already dead. Friedrich Nietzsche has said, “God is dead.” He was wrong on two counts: first, God has never been there, so how can he be dead? On the second count, modern physics has found that there is no matter. Matter is illusion, it only appears. What exists is energy, not matter.\nSo the old God is dead, the old materialism is dead. A new world is arising which will be based on energy and its transformations. And that is my work: how to transform your energy from sleeping to waking, from conscious to superconscious; how to destroy all unconscious corners in your being and make your whole existence full of light and consciousness.\nThere is tremendous appeal for me in Russia. People are handwriting books, typing books, cyclostyling books and spreading them underground. This is the only movement in Russia which is going on underground, the only spiritual movement in Russia. Soon we will have enough people so that they will not need to be underground.\nI will ask the permission of the Soviet Union to visit my people there. And it will be a good chance for the Soviet Union to slap the face of America. If they allow me, and stop persecuting my sannyasins – who are absolutely innocent, who have no political goals – I will support the Soviet Union against America all over the world.\nBut if they don’t allow me to enter Russia, then sooner or later my people will have to fight, inside Russia, legal battles for my entry, because I do not want to break any country’s law. I am a law- abiding person.\nBut I will find ways to meet them. I have been finding ways to send them literature, to send them tapes. I will be moving around Russia where people can come and meet me. Even if I’m against some law, I will not break it. I would like the law to be withdrawn, only then I will enter that country.\nAnd it does not matter... My people in Russia are spreading so fast that soon they will have a tremendous force. They are all young people and all the bureaucrats are old, almost dead. For seventy years, since the revolution, the same clique of people has been ruling Russia with one leg almost in the grave. Soon younger people will be coming to power, and the moment younger people come to power in any country, then I am in power.\nWith the young heart I have a synchronicity.\nMy heart beats with the younger heart. There is a tremendous communion – not only with words, but even with silence. But I will try to reach East Berlin and I will try to reach the Soviet Union and other communist countries – because this whole world is one, and I don’t believe in the bogus boundaries of nations. I don’t believe in the discrimination of religions, and I don’t believe in the discrimination of nations.\nThe world needs to be one, only then can this world be a paradise. Question 3\nWILL YOU GO TO THE GERMAN BORDER TO TALK TO THE GERMAN SANNYASINS, IF THERE IS NO PERMISSION GRANTED TO ENTER WEST GERMANY?\nCertainly. Question 4\nRIGHT NOW YOU ARE NOT FAR AWAY FROM THE CITY OF ROME. ARE THERE ANY PLANS TO MEET WITH THE POPE?\nI never make plans; that is not my way of life. But existence may have some plan. If it has brought me so close to Rome, it may take me exactly to the Vatican.\nI would love to encounter this bogus pope, who represents nobody because there is no God. Jesus represented God – he was a crackpot. And these popes are representing Jesus – these are bigger crackpots! And particularly this pope. He is not only a crackpot, he is a Polack too!\nI would love to discuss openly, publicly with him amongst his own people, because I know there is no evidence for God. For centuries people have worked and have not been able to produce any evidence. There is no evidence that Jesus is the only son of God. When God is doubtful, Jesus becomes doubtful. And claiming to be the only begotten son of God is a really egoistic attitude, a megalomania. And that too, two thousand years ago, when there was no birth control!\nWhy is Jesus the only begotten son of God? Has he got birth control? As far as the pill is concerned, only recently it has been invented for men; up to now it has been only for women. I don’t think that the pill for men was available for God. And there is no mother. The Christian trinity is ugly. It is derogatory to women.\nIt would have been far more natural: God the father, God the mother, God the son – that would have looked like a natural unit. This guy, the holy ghost, has no place in any family. What is his purpose? And to what gender does he belong? Is he man or woman?\nAnd Jesus is so fanatic about it. When his mother comes to meet him – he is preaching in a crowd – somebody in the crowd shouts, “Jesus, your mother has come to see you.” And the way he answers is so ugly that all his preachings about love and peace are destroyed. He says, “Tell that woman” –\nhe does not use the word ‘mother’ – “tell that woman that I know only my father, who is in heaven. I don’t have any mother, any father, other than God.”\nThese popes are representing Jesus. These popes are representing THE HOLY BIBLE – which is the most unholy book in existence. Five hundred pages in THE HOLY BIBLE are sheer pornography. I would like to discuss with him that if this is not pornography, then what is?\nThe pope is thought to be infallible. Just five minutes before his election he was fallible, he was just a cardinal. And after the election some miracle happens – and this is an election! – and he becomes infallible.\nNobody can elect an enlightened person. Election is basically political.\nTruth does not depend on an election. If truth were to depend on an election, you would have been primitive even today. Galileo would have been defeated. He was alone in saying that the earth goes round the sun, not vice-versa. In his old age, sick, dying, he was dragged to the court of the pope, and the pope forced him to change that sentence in his book. Galileo must have been a man of immense sense of humor. He said, “I have no difficulty. I will change the sentence, but I want to remind you that my changing the sentence is not going to change the earth from moving around the sun.”\nHe changed the sentence in his book, and in the footnote he wrote, “I have changed the sentence because it goes against THE BIBLE, but the earth still goes round the sun. The earth has no obligation to follow THE BIBLE.”\nIf truth were to be decided by majority voting, then Gautam Buddha would never have been chosen, because he was a rebellious person amongst the Hindus. He was condemning the VEDAS – which are worth condemning. He would not have got any votes. Then Lao Tzu would not have been chosen as a great enlightened man, because he was against Confucius, who had immense power over the whole land of China and all the politicians.\nTruth stands on its own authority. I do not represent anybody except myself. Truth is never a carbon copy, it is never second hand. It is always fresh and new, and from its freshness comes the authority.\nTruth is not authoritative.\nI want to make a distinction between these two words. Truth has an authority; its very presence changes something in you. It is not authoritative. It cannot force you to change, to convert, to follow another ideology. It has no mundane power; its power is spiritual.\nI would really love, if existence plans it that way... because I have never planned my life, and I have loved the art of not planning life. It has given me tremendous blissfulness, because nothing disappoints me and each day takes care of itself.\nI have left myself in the hands of existence.\nIf it can manage millions of stars, millions of planets, millions of solar systems... I am just an ordinary man, it can manage life for me too.\nI am in an utter let-go.\nWherever existence takes me, I am willing.\nThere is every possibility that you may find me in the Vatican. Please come. Don’t miss the opportunity!\nQuestion 5\nFOR YEARS THE GERMAN POPULATION HAS BEEN DECREASING. OBVIOUSLY GERMAN WOMEN DON’T WANT TO HAVE BABIES WITH THEIR OWN HUSBANDS. WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND?\nGerman people are fortunate that their population is decreasing. The problem is not with decreasing population, the problem is with increasing population. Thirty years ago when I started teaching about birth control and abortion in India I was stoned, attempts on my life were made because I was teaching something immoral, against God. But at that time India’s population was four hundred million. If they had listened to me they would not have been in such a mess as they are now. Now India’s population is nine hundred million, more than twice as much.\nIt was estimated five years ago that by the end of this century India will have a population of one billion. That will mean that for the first time India will be ahead of all nations as far as population is concerned – even ahead of China. But just now the population explosion has been going beyond the estimates of economists and mathematicians. Now they say, by the end of the century India will not have a population of one billion, it will have a population of one billion and eight hundred million – almost two billions.\nNow, this country is going to die. No nuclear bombs are needed, its own hunger, its own starvation is going to kill it.\nIt always happens: poor countries increase their population, richer countries decrease their population. There is some fundamental law behind it. The poor countries increase their population because they don’t have any entertainment other than sex. The rich countries have many other entertainments, have more exciting explorations available to them – sex becomes secondary.\nSecondly, the richer a country is, the more women are going to be liberated from man’s drawn-out slavery. In the poor countries a woman is simply a child-producing machine. Twelve children is normal; fifteen, eighteen, even two dozen children are not unheard of. Her whole life the woman goes on producing children. No education, no music, no art, no dance – there is no time – just bringing up children takes her whole life. It destroys her beauty, makes her body ugly.\nIn a richer country the woman is not going to allow it. She is now educated; she is now demanding liberation. And why should she destroy her body by producing children, when children can be produced in test tubes? Why destroy a beautiful woman, her proportionate body, her beautiful breasts? In no cultured country will a woman be ready to feed the child with her own breasts.\nThe breasts cannot remain round if children are going to feed from them. The round breast, as you see in the statues of great art, is very much against the child. If the breast remains round, the child\nwill kill himself by drinking milk, because his nose will be closed by the breast. He cannot breathe and drink milk together – either he can breathe or he can drink the milk. The breast has to be long; then the child is capable of breathing and feeding together.\nThe scientists say that man has the capacity to go on renewing his life for at least three hundred years, if the right food, the right exercise, the right environment is made available. But man has been dying at nearabout seventy; that is the traditional time to die.\nA woman, in a country like Germany, should insist that there is no need to increase the population. You can adopt children from poor countries. That will help in two ways: it will help the rich countries and their people to keep their health and their bodies, and it will help the poor countries.\nSecondly, the question is that the women in Germany are not ready to produce children by their own husbands. This is very significant to understand, that being a husband is one thing and being a father is another. The functions are totally different. Being a wife is one thing and being a mother is totally another.\nYou can fall in love with a woman – that’s okay. You can get married, but as far as children are concerned, it is better that the scientists, the medical board, decides who is the right man for the woman, or the right woman for the man, to give the child a better life, a beautiful body, more intelligence. This should be simply a part of intelligent people’s lives. Why insist that your child should be YOUR child? What difference does it make? Can you recognize your child when he is just a living atomic cell? Can you recognize which is your child?\nMan’s function in producing children is not more than a syringe. In each lovemaking the man releases almost one million living sperm, and that is where politics starts: a great race – because only one will be able to reach the mother’s egg. It is a very small passage to us, but for those sperm proportionately it is almost two miles long. For two miles one million sperm are rushing madly to reach to the post of the chancellor! And my feeling is, the best ones will stand aside from the crowd.\nThe best people are not so mad, not so ambitious. The best people want to be left alone. In such a rush hour they would like to wait a little; when the crowd has gone, then they can move – but then they have lost the chance. Only one sperm will enter into the mother’s egg, and then the egg closes. Sometimes it happens that two sperm reach at exactly the same time – that’s why twins are born. Sometimes three, sometimes four... the record is nine, but that is a rare thing.\nThe person who reaches first may not be the best person in those one million sperm. He may not be an Albert Einstein, he may not be a Picasso, he may not be a Gautam Buddha... and I’m certain he is not; otherwise, the world would not be so full of stupid people. The mob, the masses, are almost retarded.\nIn the first world war for the first time intelligence was tested, the IQ was discovered. And it was a shock: the average individual on the earth has a mental age of only thirteen. He may be seventy physically, but mentally he is only thirteen years of age. This is a strange thing.\nIt is perfectly good that a woman should decide – and the husband should help her to decide. Take advice from the experts about who will be the right man for the woman. Finally, just as there are\nbloodbanks, there should be spermbanks. And generous people should go there and donate their sperm. Out of those millions of sperm, the best people can be chosen. We can fill the earth with geniuses.\nSo I am not against what is happening in Germany, it is just the beginning, the beginning of something more that is going to come. A sperm can be chosen by the medical people, and that can be injected in the woman. And one should be happy that one has a beautiful child; why insist that it should be yours? This possessiveness is primitive. It should be the best, it should be the most healthy; it should be a contribution to the world – its beauty, its grandeur, its fragrance.\nIt is one thing to live with one person; it is totally a different thing to give birth to a child. For that different laws are needed. And this stupid possessiveness – “The child should be mine” – has to be dropped. If the population is falling, it is very good. If all the rich countries follow the same pattern and their populations start falling, they all can adopt children from poor countries, and we can balance the world in a better way.\nAnd remember, crossbreeding is not only helpful in animals, in birds, in fruits. Crossbreeding is a tremendous phenomenon, but man is so unscientific that he has not tried it. If more and more people from other, faraway countries – Ethiopia, India, Thailand, where people are dying from poverty – if their children are adopted by the rich countries, their blood will bring something new to you. Soon they will be able to produce children. Their children will be far higher in every possible way. This is a scientific truth that I am telling you.\nDecreasing population is a blessing. Increasing population is a curse.\nQuestion 6\nYOU ONCE SAID THAT SANNYASINS SHOULD MAKE LOVE TO THEIR FRIENDS’ WOMEN. IS THIS STILL VALID?\nIt is more valid than it ever was. I am against marriage. Marriage is one of the sicknesses which have tortured humanity for centuries. It has not given anything, but it has taken away much.\nMy idea is, the family should disappear. It is out of date. People should live in communes – five thousand people living together. The whole village becomes a commune. Nobody is married to anybody, but whomever you love, you live with that person. There is no reason why law should come in between you and your lover. The policeman, the magistrate, the registrar of marriages, the priest and the church... why this whole queue?\nLove is enough.\nThis queue was invented because people became aware: today you may be in love with someone and tomorrow the love disappears. All real things are changing; only unreal things don’t change.\nIf your love is made of plastic, it won’t change; but if it is made of roses, it is going to change. And love is a roseflower. In the morning it is so beautiful, it seems that it is immortal; shining in the sun\nwith the dewdrops on it, dancing in the breeze, releasing its fragrance, it seems it is going to remain there forever. But by the evening the petals have fallen down, the rose has disappeared.\nExistence is constant change, flux.\nThe idea of permanency is a product of man’s own mind. To make love permanent has been one of the greatest crimes. You cannot do it; you cannot make a roseflower permanent. To make love permanent marriage was invented; to make it permanent laws were invented; to make it permanent, divorce or anything that changes it was condemned. The people who have lived their whole lives together have a certain respectability; nobody knows their inner agony.\nI have heard about a couple who were known in the city as the best couple. They had lived for fifty years together, and nobody had ever heard anything against the couple. Their love seemed to be eternal.\nTheir friends were gathered on their fiftieth marriage anniversary to celebrate it. Everybody was celebrating, but they were surprised because the man was missing. Somebody went out. He was sitting in the garden under a tree, very sad. The friend asked him, “What is the matter? We are all celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of your marriage, and you are sitting here so sad.”\nHe said, “There is a reason. Fifty years ago I went to my attorney to enquire about divorce. He said, ‘In this country it is not possible, and if you try it you will get at least fifty years in prison.’ And I am thinking that if I had not listened to that man, today I would have been free. Fifty years I have been in prison. That attorney is dead; otherwise I would have shot him. That idiot made me afraid; otherwise, I would be celebrating, dancing, because I would have come out of prison. There seems to be nowhere for me except death.”\nWhat happens? People fall in love. They are not pretending; it is true for the moment, and in that intensity of the moment they start promising, “I will love you forever”; and if you are born somewhere in India or in the Eastern part of the world, people even promise, “I will love you for many, many lives to come.” The intensity of love of that moment makes them promise, not knowing what is going to come tomorrow.\nA man of understanding never promises, because what can be said about the next moment? – I may be dead.\nAnd once they get married... Nobody is made for anybody, remember. And even if somebody was made for you, it would be so difficult to find him or her among five billion people on the earth that for your whole life you would go on searching! By the time you had found them, life would have slipped out of your hands.\nI have heard of a woman who said that she remained unmarried because she wanted a perfect husband. And she searched and searched...\nThe friend she was relating it to asked her, “Did you not find a single perfect man?” She said, “I found one, but he was looking for a perfect woman.”\nMeeting on the beach, meeting in a disco, dancing, is one thing. Falling in love is very easy, but remaining twenty-four hours a day with the man or the woman is a totally different affair. Then you come to know the reality. What you had fallen in love with was a mask. You were pretending to be your best; she was pretending to be her best – but you cannot go on pretending twenty-four hours, year after year. Sooner or later you start seeing the reality of the person and both become disillusioned. At that point marriage prevents them from separating, religion prevents them from separating, the government prevents them from separating. Originally the problem was the children: if they separate what will happen to the children? Their duty towards their children prevents them from separating.\nMy simple idea is that the family should disappear; people should live in communes. There should be no marriage; hence there will be no possibility of any divorce. People should love and be together as long as they feel love is still alive. The moment they see love declining, it is time to depart – and depart with friendship, depart with gratitude for all those moments that you have lived in the past; depart as friends.\nAs far as children are concerned, the commune should take care of the children. Everybody who is part of the commune should contribute to the commune, whether they have children or not. All children are the commune’s.\nThis will give the children also a richness of experience: so many uncles, so many aunts. They will not get what psychologists call fixation: father fixation, mother fixation. Every boy gets a mother fixation because he comes to know only one woman and he becomes fixated with that idea of the woman. And his whole life, unconsciously, he is searching for the same woman.\nHe is not going to find her. He wanted to make love to his mother; she wanted to make love to her father. But that was not possible, and now they are searching for their fathers and their mothers. You cannot find them; existence does not produce similar people, it always produces unique people.\nSo the man is looking in his wife for his mother, and he does not find her; the woman is looking for her father and she does not find him – and both are disappointed. Psychologists say, if we can give the child a richer experience of many people, he will not have a fixation. He will have some idea of what a woman is, but the idea will be vague and it will be possible for him to adjust that idea to any woman he likes, or to any man the woman likes. She has known so many uncles, who were all loving. And remember, uncles are more loving than fathers, aunts are more loving than mothers – because they don’t have to suffer your trouble and your nuisance.\nIn the TALMUD God says to the people, “I am not your uncle, I am not a nice person; I am a very jealous God.” What is important is that he makes the statement, “I am not your uncle; I am your father.”\nIf the commune takes the responsibility for the children, no burden of the children will be on the people. You can meet them – they can come to meet you. They will only see your beauty, your love. They will not see the mother nagging the father; they will not see the father beating the mother; they will not see the mother throwing things around, breaking plates... throwing pillows at each other.\nThe child will not see all these ugly scenes, and he will not have any idea that these things have to be done. In his own life he will not repeat it because he has no conception of it.\nIf there is no marriage, jealousy will disappear automatically – which is almost a cancer of the soul. Every man is jealous, every woman is jealous, and jealousy is pure poison; it destroys your love. You become each other’s jailers. What we have done up to now has not been a blessing to humanity. Things have to be changed from the very roots.\nQuestion 7\nWHEN YOU WERE IN THE HIMALAYAS YOU ASKED YOUR SANNYASINS TO STAY AT HOME: NO VISITORS, NO TALKS. ISN’T IT A RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOU WHEN HUNDREDS OF SANNYASINS WILL BE COMING TO CRETE NOW?\nIt is my joy.\nIn India I told sannyasins not to come to Kulu Manali because we wanted to purchase land and houses in Kulu Manali, and if thousands of sannyasins had started coming, immediately the orthodox, the old-fashioned people would have started freaking out. And the politicians are always looking for an opportunity...\nThose few days that I was not with my sannyasins, not talking to them, not looking in their eyes, not looking at their faces, not listening to their laughter, I felt undernourished.\nSo it is not a responsibility, it is absolute blissfulness for me to be with my people.\nAnd here, I can call them because here we are not going to have a commune, so we don’t care what the government thinks, what the bishop thinks. And they are already thinking stupid things. Just the other day I saw that the bishop of Crete called a meeting of other priests, because he has been informed that two thousand sannyasins are going to be here, and he is afraid for the traditional values. He is afraid that my sannyasins will not fit with their society, with their church.\nCertainly I have the most misfit people around the whole world, who don’t fit anywhere – but they fit with me absolutely! And I don’t see the point. I have such nice people, such beautiful people, such loving people; you cannot find anywhere else such people together. But the society is afraid.\nI had to leave Kulu Manali only for that reason, because the government was ready to give me land, to allow me to purchase houses there, but with conditions.\nI don’t accept any conditions.\nThe conditions were that no foreign sannyasins would be allowed, that no foreign news media would be allowed. So they were going to cut me off from my own people around the world. And this whole world belongs to me; there is nobody who is a foreigner.\nI refused. I moved out of Kulu Manali immediately, the moment I heard their conditions. I said, “I would rather live in an airplane and move around the earth, meeting my people – so they need not worry about a commune and visas, and you preventing them and governments preventing them. I can move around the world; that is easier.” And I am ready to do that.\nIf some government is not going to give me unconditionally a place where twenty to forty thousand sannyasins can gather at a time, then I am not going to stay anywhere. Then it means no country belongs to me. I am country-less, homeless. And I will remain a wanderer, moving around the world, meeting my people wherever they are.\nIt is not a responsibility, it is an immense joy to me. QUESTIONS FROM NIEUWE REVUE, HOLLAND.\nQuestion 8\nBEFORE I LEFT HOLLAND I ASKED MY DAUGHTER IF SHE HAD SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU, SO THESE FOUR ARE FROM HER:\nQuestion 9\nYOU HAVE NICE EYES, BUT WHY DON’T YOU SHAVE YOUR BEARD?\nI may have nice eyes, but you have a wrong question. You should ask your poppa why he has been shaving his beard. I have not been growing it, it grows itself!\nJust look at your poppa. I have seen him. He would look far more beautiful with a little beard, mustache. Ask him why he has been cutting something natural.\nJust think, if a woman takes certain hormones and starts growing a beard and mustache, how she will look. Do you think she will look beautiful? She will be simply horrible.\nAnd the same is true about man. The moment he starts shaving his beard and mustache, he is doing something unconsciously: because every woman looks beautiful to him, he thinks perhaps the beauty is because there is no mustache and no beard. So the poor fellow cuts his own beard and his own mustache. But he forgets that to a woman he will look just like another woman. Unless she is a lesbian, he will have no interest for her.\nA woman loves a beard; a woman loves a mustache. Man and woman should remain as distinct as nature has made them. The more distinct they are, the more attractive they are to each other; the closer they come, the more the attraction disappears.\nNow there is coming into fashion a certain dress which can be used by both the sexes. That will destroy much. And if you go to the logical conclusion, you should tell your poppa, “You should cut off your genitals also”!\nI have never cut my beard. These are my original hairs. If they fall by themselves I cannot help it, but it will be very difficult for you to find a man who has his original hairs – and I love originality. I have never shaved, I have never cut them – it is ugly.\nBut there are people who are doing it simply because women look beautiful; they think they will also look beautiful. But women look beautiful from the man’s eyes, from the man’s hormones. The\nwoman has different eyes and different hormones. Without a beard and mustache you will not look beautiful to her. She may tolerate you because it is the fashion, but once she understands what you are trying to do she is not going to tolerate you. No woman should ask her husband to shave his beard or the mustache, because by shaving his beard and mustache he loses something of his manliness.\nQuestion 10\nIF YOU HAD THREE FREE WISHES, WHAT WOULD THEY BE?\nI don’t have any. Question 11\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE FOOD?\nA difficult question, because I don’t know the name. Question 12\nDO YOU LIKE THE MUSIC OF MADONNA, THE POPSTAR?\nI hate it!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6314","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/socrates_poisoned_again_after_25_centuries/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/socrates_poisoned_again_after_25_centuries/>Socrates Poisoned Again After 25 Centuries</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">4 The art of not planning life</h1><div class=post-meta>30 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6314 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Socrates_Poisoned_Again_After_25_Centuries/part4.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

enter Germany. I have never been in Germany; I have never committed any
crime against German law. I have not even applied for any tourist visa,
so from my side there has been no question of entering Germany. It must
be his own phobia.</p><p><br></p><p>He is certainly afraid; that can be said categorically. And the
reason for his fear is that the German youth is deeply in love with me.
The German youth is finished with the politicians. The day Adolf Hitler
died an ignominious death, German politicians died for the younger
generation; all politics became ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>German priests are also afraid. They may be behind the chancellor in
a joint conspiracy, because this is the first time in the whole of
history that Christians are facing a man who is taking the youth, the
very cream, the intelligent people, educated people, the talented
people, out of their fold. Christians have been trying to do it for
centuries around the world, but they have never been successful in
changing the cultured, the educated, the intelligent, the talented. They
have been successful only in changing the beggars, the starving, the
orphans.</p><p>To change an orphan into a Christian or a beggar into a Christian is
not much of a conversion, because the person is not going for
Christianity, he is going against his poverty. The people who</p><p>have come to me have not come against any poverty, they have come for
a spiritual search, which the church has not been able to provide. To
change a Hindu into a Christian, or a Jew into a Christian, or a
Buddhist into a Christian, is an easy job; it is simply changing the
prisoner from one prison to another prison.</p><p><br></p><p>I have taken you out of the prison into the open sky. I don’t have
any prison to give to you.</p><p>The politicians are afraid, the religious heads are afraid – and it
is a good sign. It means that we are winning and they are losing. People
become afraid only when they are losing. Why should the German
chancellor be so afraid? I was not coming into his country, but he is as
afraid as if he is living in my country.</p><p><br></p><p>I will come to Germany, because the law is absolutely illegal,
criminal. My sannyasins are going to fight it in every court of law, and
I will come triumphant into Germany and challenge the chancellor to face
me openly before the public.</p><p><br></p><p>He has taken a very idiotic step. He will repent for it. Question
2</p><p>THERE IS NO WAY FOR THE PEOPLE OF EAST GERMANY TO COME TO CRETE. ARE
YOU GOING TO VISIT THEM IN EAST BERLIN?</p><p><br></p><p>I have many sannyasins in East Berlin – and very brave people. They
wanted to make a commune in East Berlin; I had to stop them. I had to
tell them, “Remain underground.” The same is true about the Soviet
Union. I have thousands of sannyasins who are underground.</p><p><br></p><p>The KGB has been able to find out about two hundred sannyasins and
they are persecuting them, harassing them. They have taken their books,
they have taken their tapes, they have taken their videos. But there is
nothing that they can say is against... I stand for a higher communism
than the Soviet Union stands for. According to me the Soviet Union is
not communist yet.</p><p><br></p><p>The rich and the poor, the old classes, are no longer there, but now
a bigger distance between people has arisen: the bureaucrats, the people
who have power, and the people who don’t have any power. The rich were
never so powerful, and the poor were always able – if they had talent
and intelligence – to move into higher strata of society. But in Russia
there is no movement possible, it is a static society, a dead
society.</p><p><br></p><p>I love the idea of communism, but a communism can only be true,
authentic, when it is based on anarchism. If it is based on the
dictatorship of the proletariat, it is not going to be authentic
communism. It will be simply poverty distributed equally.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like no poverty at all; all the people should be rich in
every possible way. My communism means equal opportunity for everybody
to be unique and unequal – because psychologically nobody is equal, and
if you want them to be equal you have to force them to be equal. And any
equality</p><p>which is dependent on force is not worth the name. You have to take
all freedom, you have to take all individuality. You have to sacrifice
the real individual at the feet of an unreal society.</p><p><br></p><p>The society does not exist – it is only a name. If you search for
society you will not find it anywhere. Wherever you will go, you will
come across individuals. My communism is individualistic, and my
communism is anarchistic.</p><p><br></p><p>I would love to go to East Berlin. Right now they allow me at least
to pass on the road. I will use that opportunity – my people can meet me
on the road.</p><p><br></p><p>And the number of sannyasins will be growing faster in Russia for a
psychological reason: for seventy years Russian people have been denied
every spiritual urge. It is going to explode any day.</p><p><br></p><p>The Russian youth is burning with a desire to know more about the
mysteries of life, not only about materialism, which is already dead.
Friedrich Nietzsche has said, “God is dead.” He was wrong on two counts:
first, God has never been there, so how can he be dead? On the second
count, modern physics has found that there is no matter. Matter is
illusion, it only appears. What exists is energy, not matter.</p><p><br></p><p>So the old God is dead, the old materialism is dead. A new world is
arising which will be based on energy and its transformations. And that
is my work: how to transform your energy from sleeping to waking, from
conscious to superconscious; how to destroy all unconscious corners in
your being and make your whole existence full of light and
consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>There is tremendous appeal for me in Russia. People are handwriting
books, typing books, cyclostyling books and spreading them underground.
This is the only movement in Russia which is going on underground, the
only spiritual movement in Russia. Soon we will have enough people so
that they will not need to be underground.</p><p><br></p><p>I will ask the permission of the Soviet Union to visit my people
there. And it will be a good chance for the Soviet Union to slap the
face of America. If they allow me, and stop persecuting my sannyasins –
who are absolutely innocent, who have no political goals – I will
support the Soviet Union against America all over the world.</p><p><br></p><p>But if they don’t allow me to enter Russia, then sooner or later my
people will have to fight, inside Russia, legal battles for my entry,
because I do not want to break any country’s law. I am a law- abiding
person.</p><p><br></p><p>But I will find ways to meet them. I have been finding ways to send
them literature, to send them tapes. I will be moving around Russia
where people can come and meet me. Even if I’m against some law, I will
not break it. I would like the law to be withdrawn, only then I will
enter that country.</p><p><br></p><p>And it does not matter... My people in Russia are spreading so fast
that soon they will have a tremendous force. They are all young people
and all the bureaucrats are old, almost dead. For seventy years, since
the revolution, the same clique of people has been ruling Russia with
one leg almost in the grave. Soon younger people will be coming to
power, and the moment younger people come to power in any country, then
I am in power.</p><p>With the young heart I have a synchronicity.</p><p><br></p><p>My heart beats with the younger heart. There is a tremendous
communion – not only with words, but even with silence. But I will try
to reach East Berlin and I will try to reach the Soviet Union and other
communist countries – because this whole world is one, and I don’t
believe in the bogus boundaries of nations. I don’t believe in the
discrimination of religions, and I don’t believe in the discrimination
of nations.</p><p><br></p><p>The world needs to be one, only then can this world be a paradise.
Question 3</p><p>WILL YOU GO TO THE GERMAN BORDER TO TALK TO THE GERMAN SANNYASINS, IF
THERE IS NO PERMISSION GRANTED TO ENTER WEST GERMANY?</p><p><br></p><p>Certainly. Question 4</p><p>RIGHT NOW YOU ARE NOT FAR AWAY FROM THE CITY OF ROME. ARE THERE ANY
PLANS TO MEET WITH THE POPE?</p><p><br></p><p>I never make plans; that is not my way of life. But existence may
have some plan. If it has brought me so close to Rome, it may take me
exactly to the Vatican.</p><p><br></p><p>I would love to encounter this bogus pope, who represents nobody
because there is no God. Jesus represented God – he was a crackpot. And
these popes are representing Jesus – these are bigger crackpots! And
particularly this pope. He is not only a crackpot, he is a Polack
too!</p><p><br></p><p>I would love to discuss openly, publicly with him amongst his own
people, because I know there is no evidence for God. For centuries
people have worked and have not been able to produce any evidence. There
is no evidence that Jesus is the only son of God. When God is doubtful,
Jesus becomes doubtful. And claiming to be the only begotten son of God
is a really egoistic attitude, a megalomania. And that too, two thousand
years ago, when there was no birth control!</p><p><br></p><p>Why is Jesus the only begotten son of God? Has he got birth control?
As far as the pill is concerned, only recently it has been invented for
men; up to now it has been only for women. I don’t think that the pill
for men was available for God. And there is no mother. The Christian
trinity is ugly. It is derogatory to women.</p><p><br></p><p>It would have been far more natural: God the father, God the mother,
God the son – that would have looked like a natural unit. This guy, the
holy ghost, has no place in any family. What is his purpose? And to what
gender does he belong? Is he man or woman?</p><p><br></p><p>And Jesus is so fanatic about it. When his mother comes to meet him –
he is preaching in a crowd – somebody in the crowd shouts, “Jesus, your
mother has come to see you.” And the way he answers is so ugly that all
his preachings about love and peace are destroyed. He says, “Tell that
woman” –</p><p>he does not use the word ‘mother’ – “tell that woman that I know only
my father, who is in heaven. I don’t have any mother, any father, other
than God.”</p><p><br></p><p>These popes are representing Jesus. These popes are representing THE
HOLY BIBLE – which is the most unholy book in existence. Five hundred
pages in THE HOLY BIBLE are sheer pornography. I would like to discuss
with him that if this is not pornography, then what is?</p><p><br></p><p>The pope is thought to be infallible. Just five minutes before his
election he was fallible, he was just a cardinal. And after the election
some miracle happens – and this is an election! – and he becomes
infallible.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody can elect an enlightened person. Election is basically
political.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth does not depend on an election. If truth were to depend on an
election, you would have been primitive even today. Galileo would have
been defeated. He was alone in saying that the earth goes round the sun,
not vice-versa. In his old age, sick, dying, he was dragged to the court
of the pope, and the pope forced him to change that sentence in his
book. Galileo must have been a man of immense sense of humor. He said,
“I have no difficulty. I will change the sentence, but I want to remind
you that my changing the sentence is not going to change the earth from
moving around the sun.”</p><p><br></p><p>He changed the sentence in his book, and in the footnote he wrote, “I
have changed the sentence because it goes against THE BIBLE, but the
earth still goes round the sun. The earth has no obligation to follow
THE BIBLE.”</p><p><br></p><p>If truth were to be decided by majority voting, then Gautam Buddha
would never have been chosen, because he was a rebellious person amongst
the Hindus. He was condemning the VEDAS – which are worth condemning. He
would not have got any votes. Then Lao Tzu would not have been chosen as
a great enlightened man, because he was against Confucius, who had
immense power over the whole land of China and all the politicians.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth stands on its own authority. I do not represent anybody except
myself. Truth is never a carbon copy, it is never second hand. It is
always fresh and new, and from its freshness comes the authority.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth is not authoritative.</p><p><br></p><p>I want to make a distinction between these two words. Truth has an
authority; its very presence changes something in you. It is not
authoritative. It cannot force you to change, to convert, to follow
another ideology. It has no mundane power; its power is spiritual.</p><p><br></p><p>I would really love, if existence plans it that way... because I have
never planned my life, and I have loved the art of not planning life. It
has given me tremendous blissfulness, because nothing disappoints me and
each day takes care of itself.</p><p><br></p><p>I have left myself in the hands of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>If it can manage millions of stars, millions of planets, millions of
solar systems... I am just an ordinary man, it can manage life for me
too.</p><p>I am in an utter let-go.</p><p><br></p><p>Wherever existence takes me, I am willing.</p><p><br></p><p>There is every possibility that you may find me in the Vatican.
Please come. Don’t miss the opportunity!</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5</p><p><br></p><p>FOR YEARS THE GERMAN POPULATION HAS BEEN DECREASING. OBVIOUSLY GERMAN
WOMEN DON’T WANT TO HAVE BABIES WITH THEIR OWN HUSBANDS. WHAT DO YOU
RECOMMEND?</p><p><br></p><p>German people are fortunate that their population is decreasing. The
problem is not with decreasing population, the problem is with
increasing population. Thirty years ago when I started teaching about
birth control and abortion in India I was stoned, attempts on my life
were made because I was teaching something immoral, against God. But at
that time India’s population was four hundred million. If they had
listened to me they would not have been in such a mess as they are now.
Now India’s population is nine hundred million, more than twice as
much.</p><p><br></p><p>It was estimated five years ago that by the end of this century India
will have a population of one billion. That will mean that for the first
time India will be ahead of all nations as far as population is
concerned – even ahead of China. But just now the population explosion
has been going beyond the estimates of economists and mathematicians.
Now they say, by the end of the century India will not have a population
of one billion, it will have a population of one billion and eight
hundred million – almost two billions.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this country is going to die. No nuclear bombs are needed, its
own hunger, its own starvation is going to kill it.</p><p><br></p><p>It always happens: poor countries increase their population, richer
countries decrease their population. There is some fundamental law
behind it. The poor countries increase their population because they
don’t have any entertainment other than sex. The rich countries have
many other entertainments, have more exciting explorations available to
them – sex becomes secondary.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, the richer a country is, the more women are going to be
liberated from man’s drawn-out slavery. In the poor countries a woman is
simply a child-producing machine. Twelve children is normal; fifteen,
eighteen, even two dozen children are not unheard of. Her whole life the
woman goes on producing children. No education, no music, no art, no
dance – there is no time – just bringing up children takes her whole
life. It destroys her beauty, makes her body ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>In a richer country the woman is not going to allow it. She is now
educated; she is now demanding liberation. And why should she destroy
her body by producing children, when children can be produced in test
tubes? Why destroy a beautiful woman, her proportionate body, her
beautiful breasts? In no cultured country will a woman be ready to feed
the child with her own breasts.</p><p><br></p><p>The breasts cannot remain round if children are going to feed from
them. The round breast, as you see in the statues of great art, is very
much against the child. If the breast remains round, the child</p><p>will kill himself by drinking milk, because his nose will be closed
by the breast. He cannot breathe and drink milk together – either he can
breathe or he can drink the milk. The breast has to be long; then the
child is capable of breathing and feeding together.</p><p><br></p><p>The scientists say that man has the capacity to go on renewing his
life for at least three hundred years, if the right food, the right
exercise, the right environment is made available. But man has been
dying at nearabout seventy; that is the traditional time to die.</p><p><br></p><p>A woman, in a country like Germany, should insist that there is no
need to increase the population. You can adopt children from poor
countries. That will help in two ways: it will help the rich countries
and their people to keep their health and their bodies, and it will help
the poor countries.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, the question is that the women in Germany are not ready to
produce children by their own husbands. This is very significant to
understand, that being a husband is one thing and being a father is
another. The functions are totally different. Being a wife is one thing
and being a mother is totally another.</p><p><br></p><p>You can fall in love with a woman – that’s okay. You can get married,
but as far as children are concerned, it is better that the scientists,
the medical board, decides who is the right man for the woman, or the
right woman for the man, to give the child a better life, a beautiful
body, more intelligence. This should be simply a part of intelligent
people’s lives. Why insist that your child should be YOUR child? What
difference does it make? Can you recognize your child when he is just a
living atomic cell? Can you recognize which is your child?</p><p><br></p><p>Man’s function in producing children is not more than a syringe. In
each lovemaking the man releases almost one million living sperm, and
that is where politics starts: a great race – because only one will be
able to reach the mother’s egg. It is a very small passage to us, but
for those sperm proportionately it is almost two miles long. For two
miles one million sperm are rushing madly to reach to the post of the
chancellor! And my feeling is, the best ones will stand aside from the
crowd.</p><p><br></p><p>The best people are not so mad, not so ambitious. The best people
want to be left alone. In such a rush hour they would like to wait a
little; when the crowd has gone, then they can move – but then they have
lost the chance. Only one sperm will enter into the mother’s egg, and
then the egg closes. Sometimes it happens that two sperm reach at
exactly the same time – that’s why twins are born. Sometimes three,
sometimes four... the record is nine, but that is a rare thing.</p><p><br></p><p>The person who reaches first may not be the best person in those one
million sperm. He may not be an Albert Einstein, he may not be a
Picasso, he may not be a Gautam Buddha... and I’m certain he is not;
otherwise, the world would not be so full of stupid people. The mob, the
masses, are almost retarded.</p><p><br></p><p>In the first world war for the first time intelligence was tested,
the IQ was discovered. And it was a shock: the average individual on the
earth has a mental age of only thirteen. He may be seventy physically,
but mentally he is only thirteen years of age. This is a strange
thing.</p><p><br></p><p>It is perfectly good that a woman should decide – and the husband
should help her to decide. Take advice from the experts about who will
be the right man for the woman. Finally, just as there are</p><p>bloodbanks, there should be spermbanks. And generous people should go
there and donate their sperm. Out of those millions of sperm, the best
people can be chosen. We can fill the earth with geniuses.</p><p><br></p><p>So I am not against what is happening in Germany, it is just the
beginning, the beginning of something more that is going to come. A
sperm can be chosen by the medical people, and that can be injected in
the woman. And one should be happy that one has a beautiful child; why
insist that it should be yours? This possessiveness is primitive. It
should be the best, it should be the most healthy; it should be a
contribution to the world – its beauty, its grandeur, its fragrance.</p><p><br></p><p>It is one thing to live with one person; it is totally a different
thing to give birth to a child. For that different laws are needed. And
this stupid possessiveness – “The child should be mine” – has to be
dropped. If the population is falling, it is very good. If all the rich
countries follow the same pattern and their populations start falling,
they all can adopt children from poor countries, and we can balance the
world in a better way.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, crossbreeding is not only helpful in animals, in birds,
in fruits. Crossbreeding is a tremendous phenomenon, but man is so
unscientific that he has not tried it. If more and more people from
other, faraway countries – Ethiopia, India, Thailand, where people are
dying from poverty – if their children are adopted by the rich
countries, their blood will bring something new to you. Soon they will
be able to produce children. Their children will be far higher in every
possible way. This is a scientific truth that I am telling you.</p><p><br></p><p>Decreasing population is a blessing. Increasing population is a
curse.</p><p>Question 6</p><p><br></p><p>YOU ONCE SAID THAT SANNYASINS SHOULD MAKE LOVE TO THEIR FRIENDS’
WOMEN. IS THIS STILL VALID?</p><p><br></p><p>It is more valid than it ever was. I am against marriage. Marriage is
one of the sicknesses which have tortured humanity for centuries. It has
not given anything, but it has taken away much.</p><p><br></p><p>My idea is, the family should disappear. It is out of date. People
should live in communes – five thousand people living together. The
whole village becomes a commune. Nobody is married to anybody, but
whomever you love, you live with that person. There is no reason why law
should come in between you and your lover. The policeman, the
magistrate, the registrar of marriages, the priest and the church... why
this whole queue?</p><p><br></p><p>Love is enough.</p><p><br></p><p>This queue was invented because people became aware: today you may be
in love with someone and tomorrow the love disappears. All real things
are changing; only unreal things don’t change.</p><p><br></p><p>If your love is made of plastic, it won’t change; but if it is made
of roses, it is going to change. And love is a roseflower. In the
morning it is so beautiful, it seems that it is immortal; shining in the
sun</p><p>with the dewdrops on it, dancing in the breeze, releasing its
fragrance, it seems it is going to remain there forever. But by the
evening the petals have fallen down, the rose has disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence is constant change, flux.</p><p><br></p><p>The idea of permanency is a product of man’s own mind. To make love
permanent has been one of the greatest crimes. You cannot do it; you
cannot make a roseflower permanent. To make love permanent marriage was
invented; to make it permanent laws were invented; to make it permanent,
divorce or anything that changes it was condemned. The people who have
lived their whole lives together have a certain respectability; nobody
knows their inner agony.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about a couple who were known in the city as the best
couple. They had lived for fifty years together, and nobody had ever
heard anything against the couple. Their love seemed to be eternal.</p><p><br></p><p>Their friends were gathered on their fiftieth marriage anniversary to
celebrate it. Everybody was celebrating, but they were surprised because
the man was missing. Somebody went out. He was sitting in the garden
under a tree, very sad. The friend asked him, “What is the matter? We
are all celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of your marriage, and you
are sitting here so sad.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “There is a reason. Fifty years ago I went to my attorney to
enquire about divorce. He said, ‘In this country it is not possible, and
if you try it you will get at least fifty years in prison.’ And I am
thinking that if I had not listened to that man, today I would have been
free. Fifty years I have been in prison. That attorney is dead;
otherwise I would have shot him. That idiot made me afraid; otherwise, I
would be celebrating, dancing, because I would have come out of prison.
There seems to be nowhere for me except death.”</p><p><br></p><p>What happens? People fall in love. They are not pretending; it is
true for the moment, and in that intensity of the moment they start
promising, “I will love you forever”; and if you are born somewhere in
India or in the Eastern part of the world, people even promise, “I will
love you for many, many lives to come.” The intensity of love of that
moment makes them promise, not knowing what is going to come
tomorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of understanding never promises, because what can be said about
the next moment? – I may be dead.</p><p><br></p><p>And once they get married... Nobody is made for anybody, remember.
And even if somebody was made for you, it would be so difficult to find
him or her among five billion people on the earth that for your whole
life you would go on searching! By the time you had found them, life
would have slipped out of your hands.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard of a woman who said that she remained unmarried because
she wanted a perfect husband. And she searched and searched...</p><p><br></p><p>The friend she was relating it to asked her, “Did you not find a
single perfect man?” She said, “I found one, but he was looking for a
perfect woman.”</p><p>Meeting on the beach, meeting in a disco, dancing, is one thing.
Falling in love is very easy, but remaining twenty-four hours a day with
the man or the woman is a totally different affair. Then you come to
know the reality. What you had fallen in love with was a mask. You were
pretending to be your best; she was pretending to be her best – but you
cannot go on pretending twenty-four hours, year after year. Sooner or
later you start seeing the reality of the person and both become
disillusioned. At that point marriage prevents them from separating,
religion prevents them from separating, the government prevents them
from separating. Originally the problem was the children: if they
separate what will happen to the children? Their duty towards their
children prevents them from separating.</p><p><br></p><p>My simple idea is that the family should disappear; people should
live in communes. There should be no marriage; hence there will be no
possibility of any divorce. People should love and be together as long
as they feel love is still alive. The moment they see love declining, it
is time to depart – and depart with friendship, depart with gratitude
for all those moments that you have lived in the past; depart as
friends.</p><p><br></p><p>As far as children are concerned, the commune should take care of the
children. Everybody who is part of the commune should contribute to the
commune, whether they have children or not. All children are the
commune’s.</p><p><br></p><p>This will give the children also a richness of experience: so many
uncles, so many aunts. They will not get what psychologists call
fixation: father fixation, mother fixation. Every boy gets a mother
fixation because he comes to know only one woman and he becomes fixated
with that idea of the woman. And his whole life, unconsciously, he is
searching for the same woman.</p><p><br></p><p>He is not going to find her. He wanted to make love to his mother;
she wanted to make love to her father. But that was not possible, and
now they are searching for their fathers and their mothers. You cannot
find them; existence does not produce similar people, it always produces
unique people.</p><p><br></p><p>So the man is looking in his wife for his mother, and he does not
find her; the woman is looking for her father and she does not find him
– and both are disappointed. Psychologists say, if we can give the child
a richer experience of many people, he will not have a fixation. He will
have some idea of what a woman is, but the idea will be vague and it
will be possible for him to adjust that idea to any woman he likes, or
to any man the woman likes. She has known so many uncles, who were all
loving. And remember, uncles are more loving than fathers, aunts are
more loving than mothers – because they don’t have to suffer your
trouble and your nuisance.</p><p><br></p><p>In the TALMUD God says to the people, “I am not your uncle, I am not
a nice person; I am a very jealous God.” What is important is that he
makes the statement, “I am not your uncle; I am your father.”</p><p><br></p><p>If the commune takes the responsibility for the children, no burden
of the children will be on the people. You can meet them – they can come
to meet you. They will only see your beauty, your love. They will not
see the mother nagging the father; they will not see the father beating
the mother; they will not see the mother throwing things around,
breaking plates... throwing pillows at each other.</p><p><br></p><p>The child will not see all these ugly scenes, and he will not have
any idea that these things have to be done. In his own life he will not
repeat it because he has no conception of it.</p><p>If there is no marriage, jealousy will disappear automatically –
which is almost a cancer of the soul. Every man is jealous, every woman
is jealous, and jealousy is pure poison; it destroys your love. You
become each other’s jailers. What we have done up to now has not been a
blessing to humanity. Things have to be changed from the very roots.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 7</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN YOU WERE IN THE HIMALAYAS YOU ASKED YOUR SANNYASINS TO STAY AT
HOME: NO VISITORS, NO TALKS. ISN’T IT A RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOU WHEN
HUNDREDS OF SANNYASINS WILL BE COMING TO CRETE NOW?</p><p><br></p><p>It is my joy.</p><p><br></p><p>In India I told sannyasins not to come to Kulu Manali because we
wanted to purchase land and houses in Kulu Manali, and if thousands of
sannyasins had started coming, immediately the orthodox, the
old-fashioned people would have started freaking out. And the
politicians are always looking for an opportunity...</p><p><br></p><p>Those few days that I was not with my sannyasins, not talking to
them, not looking in their eyes, not looking at their faces, not
listening to their laughter, I felt undernourished.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is not a responsibility, it is absolute blissfulness for me to
be with my people.</p><p><br></p><p>And here, I can call them because here we are not going to have a
commune, so we don’t care what the government thinks, what the bishop
thinks. And they are already thinking stupid things. Just the other day
I saw that the bishop of Crete called a meeting of other priests,
because he has been informed that two thousand sannyasins are going to
be here, and he is afraid for the traditional values. He is afraid that
my sannyasins will not fit with their society, with their church.</p><p><br></p><p>Certainly I have the most misfit people around the whole world, who
don’t fit anywhere – but they fit with me absolutely! And I don’t see
the point. I have such nice people, such beautiful people, such loving
people; you cannot find anywhere else such people together. But the
society is afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to leave Kulu Manali only for that reason, because the
government was ready to give me land, to allow me to purchase houses
there, but with conditions.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t accept any conditions.</p><p><br></p><p>The conditions were that no foreign sannyasins would be allowed, that
no foreign news media would be allowed. So they were going to cut me off
from my own people around the world. And this whole world belongs to me;
there is nobody who is a foreigner.</p><p><br></p><p>I refused. I moved out of Kulu Manali immediately, the moment I heard
their conditions. I said, “I would rather live in an airplane and move
around the earth, meeting my people – so they need not worry about a
commune and visas, and you preventing them and governments preventing
them. I can move around the world; that is easier.” And I am ready to do
that.</p><p>If some government is not going to give me unconditionally a place
where twenty to forty thousand sannyasins can gather at a time, then I
am not going to stay anywhere. Then it means no country belongs to me. I
am country-less, homeless. And I will remain a wanderer, moving around
the world, meeting my people wherever they are.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a responsibility, it is an immense joy to me. QUESTIONS
FROM NIEUWE REVUE, HOLLAND.</p><p>Question 8</p><p><br></p><p>BEFORE I LEFT HOLLAND I ASKED MY DAUGHTER IF SHE HAD SOME QUESTIONS
FOR YOU, SO THESE FOUR ARE FROM HER:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 9</p><p><br></p><p>YOU HAVE NICE EYES, BUT WHY DON’T YOU SHAVE YOUR BEARD?</p><p><br></p><p>I may have nice eyes, but you have a wrong question. You should ask
your poppa why he has been shaving his beard. I have not been growing
it, it grows itself!</p><p><br></p><p>Just look at your poppa. I have seen him. He would look far more
beautiful with a little beard, mustache. Ask him why he has been cutting
something natural.</p><p><br></p><p>Just think, if a woman takes certain hormones and starts growing a
beard and mustache, how she will look. Do you think she will look
beautiful? She will be simply horrible.</p><p><br></p><p>And the same is true about man. The moment he starts shaving his
beard and mustache, he is doing something unconsciously: because every
woman looks beautiful to him, he thinks perhaps the beauty is because
there is no mustache and no beard. So the poor fellow cuts his own beard
and his own mustache. But he forgets that to a woman he will look just
like another woman. Unless she is a lesbian, he will have no interest
for her.</p><p><br></p><p>A woman loves a beard; a woman loves a mustache. Man and woman should
remain as distinct as nature has made them. The more distinct they are,
the more attractive they are to each other; the closer they come, the
more the attraction disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>Now there is coming into fashion a certain dress which can be used by
both the sexes. That will destroy much. And if you go to the logical
conclusion, you should tell your poppa, “You should cut off your
genitals also”!</p><p><br></p><p>I have never cut my beard. These are my original hairs. If they fall
by themselves I cannot help it, but it will be very difficult for you to
find a man who has his original hairs – and I love originality. I have
never shaved, I have never cut them – it is ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>But there are people who are doing it simply because women look
beautiful; they think they will also look beautiful. But women look
beautiful from the man’s eyes, from the man’s hormones. The</p><p>woman has different eyes and different hormones. Without a beard and
mustache you will not look beautiful to her. She may tolerate you
because it is the fashion, but once she understands what you are trying
to do she is not going to tolerate you. No woman should ask her husband
to shave his beard or the mustache, because by shaving his beard and
mustache he loses something of his manliness.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 10</p><p><br></p><p>IF YOU HAD THREE FREE WISHES, WHAT WOULD THEY BE?</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t have any. Question 11</p><p>WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE FOOD?</p><p><br></p><p>A difficult question, because I don’t know the name. Question 12</p><p>DO YOU LIKE THE MUSIC OF MADONNA, THE POPSTAR?</p><p><br></p><p>I hate it!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

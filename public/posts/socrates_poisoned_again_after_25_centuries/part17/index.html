CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT ENERGIES AND EXPERIENCES, AND HOW WE CAN MOVE IN THE MARKETPLACE WITHOUT GETTING INFLUENCED BY OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT SUCH GOOD ENERGY.\nThe most basic thing to remember is that when you are feeling good, in a mood of ecstasy, don’t start thinking that it is going to be your permanent state. Live the moment as joyfully, as cheerfully as possible, knowing perfectly well that it has come and it will go – just like a breeze comes in your house, with all its fragrance and freshness, and goes out from the other door.\nThis is the most fundamental thing. If you start thinking in terms of making your ecstatic moments permanent, you have already started destroying them. When they come, be grateful; when they leave, be thankful to existence. Remain open. It will happen many times – don’t be judgmental, don’t be a chooser. Remain choiceless.\nYes, there will be moments when you will be miserable. So what! There are people who are miserable and who have not even known a single moment of ecstasy; you are fortunate. Even in your misery, remember that it is not going to be permanent; it will also pass away, so don’t get too\nmuch disturbed by it. Remain at ease. Just like day and night, there are moments of joy and there are moments of sadness; accept them as part of the duality of nature, as the very way things are.\nAnd you are simply a watcher: neither you become happiness nor you become misery. Happiness comes and goes, misery comes and goes. One thing remains always there – always and always – and that is the watcher, one who witnesses. Slowly, slowly get more and more centered into the watcher. Days will come and nights will come... lives will come and deaths will come... success will come, failure will come. But if you are centered in the watcher – because that is the only reality in you – everything is a passing phenomenon.\nJust for a moment, try to feel what I am saying: just be a watcherDo not cling to any moment\nbecause it is beautiful, and do not push any moment because it is miserable. Stop doing that. That you have been doing for lives. You have not been successful yet and you will never be successful ever.\nThe only way to go beyond, to remain beyond, is to find a place from where you can watch all these changing phenomena without getting identified.\nI will tell you an ancient Sufi story...\nA king asked his wise men in the court, “I am making a very beautiful ring for myself. I have got one of the best diamonds possible. I want to keep hidden inside the ring some message that may be helpful to me in a time of utter despair. It has to be very small so that it can be hidden underneath the diamond in the ring.”\nThey were all wise men, they all were great scholars; they could have written great treatises. But to give him a message of not more than two or three words which would help him in moments of utter despairThey thought, they looked into their books, but they could not find anything.\nThe king had an old servant who was almost like his father – he had been his father’s servant. The king’s mother had died early and this servant had taken care of him, so he was not treated like a servant. The king had immense respect for him.\nThe old man said, “I am not a wise man, knowledgeable, scholarly; but I know the message – because there is only one message. And these people cannot give it to you; it can be given only by a mystic, by a man who has realized himself.\n“In my long life in the palace I have come across all kinds of people, and once, a mystic. He had also been a guest of your father and I was put into his service. When he was departing, as a gesture of thankfulness for all my services he gave me this message” – and he wrote it on a small piece of paper, folded it and told the king, “Don’t read it, just keep it hidden in the ring. Only open it when everything else has failed – when there is no way out.”\nAnd the time came soon. The country was invaded and the king lost his kingdom. He was running away on his horse just to save his life and the enemy horses were following him. He was alone; they were many. And he came to a place where the path stopped, came to a dead end; there was a cliff and a deep valley. To fall into it was to be finished. He could not go back, the enemy was there and\nhe could hear the sounds of the hooves of the horses. He could not go forward, and there was no other way.…\nSuddenly he remembered the ring. He opened it, took out the paper, and there was a small message of tremendous value: it simply said, “This too will pass.” A great silence came over him as he read the sentence, “This too will pass.” And it passed.\nEverything passes away; nothing remains in this world. The enemies who were following him must have got lost in the forest, must have moved on a wrong way; the hooves slowly, slowly were not heard any more.\nThe king was immensely grateful to the servant and to the unknown mystic. Those words proved miraculous. He folded the paper, put it back into the ring, gathered his armies again and conquered his kingdom back. And the day he was entering his capital, victorious, there was great celebration all over the capital, music, dance – and he was feeling very proud of himself.\nThe old man was walking by the side of his chariot. He said, “This time is also right: look again at the message.”\nThe king said, “What do you mean? Now I am victorious, people are celebrating. I am not in despair, I am not in a situation where there is no way out.”\nThe old man said, “Listen. This is what the saint has said to me: this message is not only for despair, it is also for pleasure. This is not only for when you are defeated; it is also for when you are victorious – not only when you are the last, but also when you are the first.”\nAnd the king opened the ring, read the message, “This too will pass,” and suddenly the same peace, the same silence, amidst the crowds, jubilating, celebrating, dancing... but the pride, the ego was gone.\nEverything passes away.\nHe asked his old servant to come on the chariot and sit with him. He asked, “Is there anything more? Everything passes away... Your message has been immensely helpful.”\nThe old man said, “The third thing the saint said, ‘Remember, everything passes. Only you remain; you remain forever as a witness.’”\nSo this is the answer to your question: Everything passes, but you remain. You are the reality; everything else is just a dream. Beautiful dreams are there, nightmares are there... But it does not matter whether it is a beautiful dream or a nightmare; what matters is the one who is seeing the dream. That seer is the only reality.\nIn the East we don’t have anything like philosophy. Scholars have translated the Eastern word darshan, which means seeing, into philosophy – finding no other way. But they are not at all connected: philosophy is thinking, not seeing.\nA blind man can think about light, but cannot see it; the man with eyes can see the light, there is no need to think about it. In the East there is nothing comparable to philosophy; in the West there is nothing comparable to darshan. I have coined my own word to translate darshan, philosia. Philo means love, and sia means to see. Sophy means thinking, sia means seeing.\nAnd the whole East has been working only in one dimension for centuries: how to find the seer. You cannot go beyond it; that is the ultimate. Everything is in front of it; it is behind the whole reality, and everything goes on changing.…\nYou are a child, you will become young, you will become old. You are alive, you will be dead – everything goes on changing.\nBut the seer is something absolutely eternal.\nJust a little glimpse of it and all your problems will start disappearing, because a totally new perspective will arise – a new vision, a new way of life, a new way of seeing things, seeing people, responding to situations. And the seer is always present, twenty-four hours day; whatever you are doing or not doing, it is there. It has been there for centuries, for eternity, waiting for you to take note of it.\nPerhaps because it has been always there, that’s why you have forgotten it. The obvious is always forgotten. Remember it when you are feeling a well-being, a euphoria; remember it when you are in misery, in anguish. Remember it in all climates, in all moods – go on remembering it. Soon you will be able to remain centered in it, there will be no need to remember.\nAnd that is the greatest day in one’s life. That day you become enlightened.\nThat day you become awakened.\nThat day zorba changes into a buddha. Question 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nIN MY EXPLORATIONS BEFORE TAKING SANNYAS, I WAS INITIATED INTO THE FOUR MEDITATION TECHNIQUES OF GURU MAHARAJI. I HAD A VERY BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE WITH ONE OF THE TECHNIQUES DURING THE INITIATION SESSION, AND STILL FIND THE TECHNIQUES SIMPLE AND FASCINATING. HOWEVER, THERE IS MUCH CONFLICT IN ME ABOUT USING THESE TECHNIQUES SINCE I HAVE BECOME A SANNYASIN. AND I NEVER FELL IN LOVE WITH GURU MAHARAJI LIKE I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU.\nCAN YOU PLEASE GIVE SOME GUIDANCE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT IS OKAY FOR ME TO CONTINUE PRACTICING THESE TECHNIQUES WHILE BEING A SANNYASIN – OR SHOULD I DROP THEM?\nALSO, I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT GURU MAHARAJI.\nThere is no problem. If you feel good with any technique you can continue it. From where it comes does not matter, who has given it to you does not matter. If it gives you pleasant feelings, a certain silence, serenity, continue it.\nBeing my sannyasin does not mean that I monopolize you. Being my sannyasin means now the whole world is yours; enjoy everything that feels good for yourself – but remember what I was just talking about. A pleasant feeling is not real meditation, because that too will pass away. It is only a technique. I want to give you something that does not pass away. Meanwhile you can play with all kinds of toys, there is no harm.\nAnd you are asking about Guru Maharaji. First I will tell you a small story; perhaps it explains Guru Maharaji to you. It is a Tibetan story.…\nA man who later on became very famous as a saint was searching for truth. He came across a so- called master who had a great following, whose only teaching was: “Surrender to me and surrender totally, and I will take you to the ultimate state of consciousness. Don’t be worried, at the right time the explosion will happen.” It had not happened to anyone.\nBut in the East, one life is not enough to realize oneself. It takes thousands of lives to find the right moment, the right time when the explosion happens. So nobody can complain, “I have been waiting for thirty years and it has not happened.” Thirty years or thirty lives don’t count.\nBut this man really, totally surrendered. And the second day the disciples were amazed because he was walking on water. They could not believe their eyes; they asked the man, “What is the secret?”\nHe said, “You must know it because you have been with the master so long. I surrendered totally, I trust him, I just repeat his name and leave everything to him, and anything becomes possible. I can pass through fire, I can walk on water, I can jump from high mountains. You look surprised,” he said. “In fact, I should be surprised that you cannot, and you have been here for years with a great master.”\nThey rushed to the master. They said, “This man is strange. He is walking on water, and he says it is the power of your name. He simply repeats your name and he can do anything.”\nThe master himself was surprised, but he did not show his surprise to the disciples. He said, “That’s what you should all be doing. If your surrender is total, my name can take you to ultimate liberation.” But deep down he was thinking that when everybody is gone, he is going to try repeating his own name and walk on water. Because if that other guy in just one day is doing such a miracle, “then what miracles can I not do? I was not aware...” So he repeated his name, walked into the water and started drowning.\nWith difficulty he was saved, and his disciples said, “What happened?”\nHe said, “Call that strange man and let me see how he walks, because if I cannot walk repeating my own name, how can he?” The man came and he walked on water.\nThe master said, “You jump from the mountain, thousands of feet high, deep into the valley.”\nThe man jumped, and they had to walk down for hours to reach him. They were thinking they were not going to find a single bone unfractured, that the man must be splattered all over the place – but he was sitting in a lotus posture under a tree looking so beautiful. He said, “Great master, your name is such a miracle!”\nThe master had to fall at his feet. He said, “Forgive me, I’m not a master at all; I’m just a charlatan. I have been cheating people, exploiting people, but I cannot exploit you. Your trust prohibits me.”\nPeople like Guru Maharaji belong to the same category as that master. If they repeat their own name, they will start drowning in the water. The technique they have given to you, which is giving you a certain peace and silence, has not given them any peace, any silence.\nI know the man, I used to know his father. His father was also doing the same thing – pretending to be a mystic. He trained this boy, Guru Maharaji – who was just six years old at that time – to memorize a few scriptures, and that became a great attraction. He would recite scriptures in pure Sanskrit.\nHis father used to say, “In his past life he was a great master; he still remembers these things from his past life” – and I know this was not true. The master, the father of Guru Maharaji, was not at ease with his wife – just as nobody is at ease.\nI asked the wife... and she said, “He is a cheat, and now he is training his children to be cheats. He has spoiled this boy; now he is spoiling the other boy.”\nAnd just because he was six or seven years old, thousands of people would come to listen, believing that it was the memory of his past life.\nWhen the father died he announced, “This boy, Guru Maharaji, will be my successor.” Guru Maharaji became world famous – but he was only sixteen when he became world famous, and a boy of sixteen naturally fell in love with a girl. I don’t see any objection to it. But his mother, who had always been against the father for spoiling the children, was now doing the same. Those children proved to be a great business.\nBut the mother was very angry. In India, if a man has some spirituality then he has to be celibate – and he had fallen in love with an American girl. Not only that, he got married. He was not of an age to get married; the girl was twenty-one years old, he was sixteen years old. He had to appear before a court to get the permission of the judge, that he was mature enough.\nThe judge said, “There is no question about your maturity. You are world famous. You can get married.”\nThis marriage created trouble. The mother renounced the boy and renounced that he was the successor to his father. She said, “The second boy is the real successor.” So now the empire is divided into two, the smaller boy and the mother in the East, and Guru Maharaji in America.\nWhen he went to India, the followers of his own brother and mother threw stones, protested against him, and he had to leave India because of them. They would not allow him to stay there – and he is doing the same thing with his mother and his brother when they come to America. These people are simply business people; religion to them is nothing but business.\nBut this has been so for centuries: exploit the innocent, exploit the ignorant, exploit the miserable, exploit people who are in suffering, in anguish and anxiety.\nI have no problem. If you can walk on water with the name of Guru Maharaji you can do it; you should not feel any conflict – because I don’t have any conflict with anybody.\nYour question may be important for other people also, because many other people may have learned something from some other sources. There is no need to be worried. Sometimes it happens that the source may be wrong but what you have got is right. The master may be fake but he has got some techniques, handed down to him by heritage, which are significant.\nBut remember, every technique can only give you an experience; I want to give you the experiencer, not the experience. Experience comes and goes; don’t rely on it. Unless you have found the experiencer... Who is feeling joy? Who is feeling pain? Who is feeling well-being? Who is feeling sad?\nWho is this consciousness?\nEvery effort should be to reach to this innermost center of the cyclone. Your whole life is a cyclone of change, of changing scenes, changing colors, but just in the middle of the cyclone there is a silent center. That is you.\nMy effort is to help you to find yourself. Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nI ALWAYS FEEL THAT I FIND A WRONG LOVER, ALWAYS SOMETHING DOESN’T FIT WELL AND I FEEL FRUSTRATED. PLEASE, I NEED YOUR MESSAGE.\nThis is the problem everybody is facing... if not today, then tomorrow. Something is always missing, something seems to be wrong, something is not fitting; all lovers throughout history have the same problem. One has to go really deep into it, because it is not one man’s problem or one woman’s problem.\nIn the first place we are all living lives according to fictions, poetries, film stories. That has given humanity a wrong impression, the impression that when there is love everything will fit, that there will be no conflict. For centuries poets have been giving the idea that lovers are made for each other.\nNobody is made for anybody else. Everybody is different from everybody else.\nYou may love a person without knowing that you love the person only because there is so much difference between you, so much distance. The distance is a challenge, the distance is an adventure; the distance makes the woman or the man worth getting hold of. But things as they appear from a distance are not the same when they come close.\nWhen you are just courting a man or a woman, everything is beautiful, everything fits – because both want that everything should fit. Anything that does not fit is not allowed to surface; it is repressed in the unconscious. So lovers sitting on the beach looking at the moon do not know each other at all. The marriage is almost finished before the honeymoon is finished.\nIt is good that in the East there is nothing like a honeymoon; they don’t give the chance for the marriage to be finished so soon. In the East people go on living together and never feel the way you are feeling – that things are not fitting, something is missing, there is no chance at all. Husbands and wives do not choose for themselves; marriages are organized by the parents, by the astrologers, by all kinds of people except the two who are going to be married.\nThe couple cannot see each other in the daylight, they can only meet each other deep in the darkness of the night. And their two families are big, so they can talk only in whispers; fighting is out of the question. Throwing clothes will not work – no woman, no man in the East knows that clothes have to be thrown; otherwise, what kind of love affair are you having? Or that plates have to be broken, or that for each and every thing you have to argue – you say one thing and the woman understands something else; she says something, you understand something else...\nThere seems to be no communication.\nAnd it starts with the honeymoon, because there for the first time you are together twenty-four hours a day. Now you cannot pretend; you have to be real. You cannot act.\nOne of my friends was saying that he went to see a movie with his wife. He saw in the movie the actor, the hero kissing his beloved with so much joy, with such ecstasy that the wife told my friend, “Look! You never kiss me like that.”\nAnd my friend said, “Darling, that is acting. I can also act, but to be with you twenty-four hours a day and still kiss you with so much ecstasy – I am not that mad.”\nThe woman said, “You don’t understand me at all. Here they are acting, but in real life the woman is his wife too.”\nMy friend said, “My God, then he must be a real actor.” I have heard...\nOne honeymoon couple came to the beach to stay in a hotel for a few days, but there seemed to be some difficulty. As they closed the door of their room, the husband said, “First, put the light off before you go to the bathroom.”\nThe woman said, “Why?”\nThe man said, “I don’t like lights. You just put the lights off, then you go to the bathroom, change your dress and come back.”\nBut she said, “I cannot come in darkness. It is an unknown room; I may stumble on some furniture or something. That I cannot do.”\nThe man said, “This seems to be a difficulty. You will have to do it.”\nThe woman said, “I don’t understand the stubbornness. Just for five minutes you cannot remain in the light? You can close your eyes.”\nThe man said, “It is better to tell you the truth, because sooner or later I will have to tell you. One of my legs is artificial and I don’t want you to see. I wanted to put it away in darkness down the side of the bed.”\nThe woman said, “That’s good that you told me. If you are so honest, I should be honest too. Now there is no need for me to go into the bathroom. I was going to remove both of my breasts; they are false.”\nNow what do you think? Has anything remained, or is everything finished? When you live together you have to be real to the other person; you cannot hide, you cannot have any secrets. And we have been given the idea from our very childhood that between wife and husband there is always harmony, everything is always fitting, they are always together, always loving, no fight. That whole ideology is the problem.\nI would like to tell you the truth. The truth is that both the persons, whoever they are, are different individuals. If you love somebody, you have to understand it that you are going to love somebody who is not your shadow, who is not your reflection in the mirror, who has his own individuality.\nUnless you have a big enough heart to accommodate somebody who is different from you, who may have different ideas about different things, you should not get into unnecessary trouble. It is better to become a monk or a nun. Why bother? Why create hell for yourself and the other? But the hell is created because you expect heaven.\nI am telling you to accept that this is the situation: the person is going to be different. You are not the master, neither is the other the master; both are simply partners who have decided, in spite of all differences, to be together. And in fact, differences add spice to your love. If you can find a woman who is just like you, you will not find much attraction in her. The woman has to be different, distant, a mystery that invites you to explore; the same is true about the man.\nBut with two mysteries meeting together, once they drop the idea that they have to agree on everything, there is no question of any fight. The fight arises because you want agreement.\nIf you are living just like two friends – she has her own ideas, you have your own ideas, she respects your ideas, you respect her ideas; she has her way, you have your own way and nobody is trying to impose on and indoctrinate the other – then there is no question of fight. And then there is no question that things are not fitting – why should they be fitting? – that something is missing.\nNothing is missing; it is just that your idea of harmony is not there. Harmony is not something very great, it is boring. Once in a while, even if you fight, once in a while even if you get really hot, that does not mean that love disappears; that simply means love is capable of absorbing even disagreements, fights, overcoming all these hindrances. Just the old kind of ideology, of man and woman.…\nI am reminded of the old biblical story which is not told very much because it is very dangerous. First, God made one man and one woman. But as you know by looking at the world, God does not seem to be very intelligent. Here, nothing is fitting; from the very beginning you can see it. He made man and woman, two persons, and gave them a small bed – not a double bed.\nThe very first night – in the beginning of the world – was the night of a tremendous fight, because the woman wanted to sleep on the bed. The man wanted that he should sleep on the bed and she should sleep on the floor. The whole night they went on fighting, beating each other, throwing things... and in the morning the man said to God, “I asked you to give me a companion but I did not ask you to give me an enemy. If you think this is a companion... I was better alone. I don’t want this woman; there is never going to be peace between me and her.”\nNow the simple thing was to ask for a double bed. I don’t understand what kind of God that was, and what these idiots were asking. The simple question was of a double bed, or two single beds; if things were getting too bad then two single beds. But instead of that he said, “I don’t want this woman; she is trying to be equal to me.” The male chauvinist idea arose that very night.\nAnd God dismantled the woman – naturally, because God is also a male chauvinist. He dismantled the woman just the way you dismantle any mechanism. He destroyed the woman and said, “Now I will make another woman who will be lower than you and will never ask for equality.” Then he made the second woman, who was Eve, by taking one of the ribs from Adam. And out of the rib he made the woman – so that she cannot ask for equality, she is nothing but a rib.\nBut you cannot manage things like this. Just a little intelligence would have been enough; this way things have not changed. It is said that every night when Adam would come back home and go to sleep, Eve would count his ribs – because she was always afraid that if he loses any other rib, that means another woman is also somewhere around.\nThere is no need for more than friendship. Love has to be a friendly affair in which nobody is superior, in which nobody is going to decide about things, in which both are fully aware that they are different, that their approach towards life is different, that they think differently, and still – with all these differences – they love each other.\nThen you will not find any problems. Problems are created by us.\nDon’t try to create something superhuman. Be human: accept the other person’s humanity with all the frailty humanity is prone to. She will commit mistakes just as you commit mistakes – and you have to learn. To be together is a great learning – of forgiving, of forgetting, of understanding that the other is as human as you are. Just a little forgiveness...\nThere is an old proverb: “To err is human and to forgive is divine.” I don’t agree. To err is human and to forgive is also human. To forgive is divine? – then you are raising it too high, beyond human reach. Bring it within human reach and learn to forgive. Learn to enjoy forgiveness, learn to ask for an apology; you don’t lose anything when you can say to your woman, “I’m sorry, I was wrong.”\nBut no man wants to say, “I was wrong.” He is always right. No woman wants to say that she was wrong; she is always right. Man tries to prove through arguments that he is right; the woman tries through emotions to prove that she is right – screaming, crying, weeping, tears. And she WINS... The man becomes afraid of the neighbors, and just to cool her down – because the children may wake up – he says, “Cool down, perhaps you are right.” But deep down he still believes he is right.\nTo be understanding means that you can be wrong, the woman may be right. It is not a guarantee that just by being man you have the power and authority to be right; neither has the woman. If we were just a little more human and a little more friendly, and we could say to each other, “We are sorry...” And what are the things you are fighting for? – so small, so trivial that if somebody asks you, you will feel embarrassed.\nJust drop the idea that everything has to fit, drop the idea that there is going to be total harmony – because those are not good ideas. If everything fits you will get bored with each other; if everything is harmonious you will lose the whole juice of the relationship. It is good that things don’t fit. It is good that there is always a gap so there is always something to explore, something to cross over, some bridge to be made. The whole life can be a tremendous exploration of each other if we accept the differences, the basic uniqueness of each individual, and we make love not a kind of slavery but a friendship.\nTry friendship, try friendliness; and remember always, there is nothing that is going to disturb you. When you see a beautiful woman, you feel attracted; you should understand that when your wife sees a beautiful man, she must be feeling attracted. If you are understanding, you will both discuss, lovingly, what a beautiful woman she was, and what a beautiful man he was.\nBut right now the situation is that you can see from miles away whether the couple coming is married or unmarried. With the married couple, the husband moves very cautiously and very carefully; he does not look here and there – as if he has got some neck problem. And the wife is watching where he is looking, what he is looking at, and taking note of everything. This is ugly.\nI was traveling – I was going to Kashmir – and in my compartment there was a beautiful woman. Her husband was coming to her every station with ice cream and with bananas, with apples. In Kashmir, fruits are really juicy.\nI asked the woman, “How long have you been married?” She said, “Seven years.”\nI said, “Don’t lie to me.”\nShe said, “What do you mean? Why should I lie to you.”\nI said, “After seven years the husband is not going to come to every station with all these things. He is not your husband.”\nShe said, “How did you come to know?”\nI said, “How did I come to know? I can see it. If he was your husband, once he had dropped you in this compartment, then only on the last station – if you are fortunate – he would come back; otherwise he would escape. Why should he come to you every station with all these things?”\nShe said, “Strange, but you are right. He is not my husband; he is my friend’s husband, but he loves me. And what you are saying about husbands is true. That has happened between me and my husband. We live together but we are miles apart; I am thinking to divorce him.”\nI said, “Don’t do that. Go on living with him and go on loving this man, and don’t let this man divorce his wife. She will be loving somebody else, don’t be worried. Existence takes care of things. But if you divorce your husband and you get married to this man, you will not get these ice creams and these fruits and this attention and this love – all will disappear.”\nIf you are just friendly and don’t make your friendliness a legal affair of husband and wife, things will be far better – because you are not a burden to anybody, not a bondage to anybody. There is no question of fitting with each other. You can have your individuality totally free from each other, and yet be in love.\nAnd really to be totally different in individuality creates the best possibility of love. Okay, Maneesha.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5911","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/socrates_poisoned_again_after_25_centuries/part17/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/socrates_poisoned_again_after_25_centuries/>Socrates Poisoned Again After 25 Centuries</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">17 This too will pass</h1><div class=post-meta>28 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5911 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Socrates_Poisoned_Again_After_25_Centuries/part17.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part16>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

BUT STILL I’M AFRAID TO GET INFLUENCED AGAIN BY PEOPLE OUTSIDE SO THAT I
FALL BACK AGAIN INTO MY OLD MIND. CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT ENERGIES
AND EXPERIENCES, AND HOW WE CAN MOVE IN THE MARKETPLACE WITHOUT GETTING
INFLUENCED BY OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT SUCH GOOD ENERGY.</p><p><br></p><p>The most basic thing to remember is that when you are feeling good,
in a mood of ecstasy, don’t start thinking that it is going to be your
permanent state. Live the moment as joyfully, as cheerfully as possible,
knowing perfectly well that it has come and it will go – just like a
breeze comes in your house, with all its fragrance and freshness, and
goes out from the other door.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the most fundamental thing. If you start thinking in terms of
making your ecstatic moments permanent, you have already started
destroying them. When they come, be grateful; when they leave, be
thankful to existence. Remain open. It will happen many times – don’t be
judgmental, don’t be a chooser. Remain choiceless.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, there will be moments when you will be miserable. So what! There
are people who are miserable and who have not even known a single moment
of ecstasy; you are fortunate. Even in your misery, remember that it is
not going to be permanent; it will also pass away, so don’t get too</p><p>much disturbed by it. Remain at ease. Just like day and night, there
are moments of joy and there are moments of sadness; accept them as part
of the duality of nature, as the very way things are.</p><p><br></p><p>And you are simply a watcher: neither you become happiness nor you
become misery. Happiness comes and goes, misery comes and goes. One
thing remains always there – always and always – and that is the
watcher, one who witnesses. Slowly, slowly get more and more centered
into the watcher. Days will come and nights will come... lives will come
and deaths will come... success will come, failure will come. But if you
are centered in the watcher – because that is the only reality in you –
everything is a passing phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>Just for a moment, try to feel what I am saying: just be a
watcher<span class=s4></span>Do not cling to any moment</p><p>because it is beautiful, and do not push any moment because it is
miserable. Stop doing that. That you have been doing for lives. You have
not been successful yet and you will never be successful ever.</p><p><br></p><p>The only way to go beyond, to remain beyond, is to find a place from
where you can watch all these changing phenomena without getting
identified.</p><p><br></p><p>I will tell you an ancient Sufi story...</p><p><br></p><p>A king asked his wise men in the court, “I am making a very beautiful
ring for myself. I have got one of the best diamonds possible. I want to
keep hidden inside the ring some message that may be helpful to me in a
time of utter despair. It has to be very small so that it can be hidden
underneath the diamond in the ring.”</p><p><br></p><p>They were all wise men, they all were great scholars; they could have
written great treatises. But to give him a message of not more than two
or three words which would help him in moments of utter despair<span class=s4></span>They thought, they looked into their books, but they
could not find anything.</p><p><br></p><p>The king had an old servant who was almost like his father – he had
been his father’s servant. The king’s mother had died early and this
servant had taken care of him, so he was not treated like a servant. The
king had immense respect for him.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man said, “I am not a wise man, knowledgeable, scholarly; but
I know the message – because there is only one message. And these people
cannot give it to you; it can be given only by a mystic, by a man who
has realized himself.</p><p><br></p><p>“In my long life in the palace I have come across all kinds of
people, and once, a mystic. He had also been a guest of your father and
I was put into his service. When he was departing, as a gesture of
thankfulness for all my services he gave me this message” – and he wrote
it on a small piece of paper, folded it and told the king, “Don’t read
it, just keep it hidden in the ring. Only open it when everything else
has failed – when there is no way out.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the time came soon. The country was invaded and the king lost his
kingdom. He was running away on his horse just to save his life and the
enemy horses were following him. He was alone; they were many. And he
came to a place where the path stopped, came to a dead end; there was a
cliff and a deep valley. To fall into it was to be finished. He could
not go back, the enemy was there and</p><p>he could hear the sounds of the hooves of the horses. He could not go
forward, and there was no other way.…</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly he remembered the ring. He opened it, took out the paper,
and there was a small message of tremendous value: it simply said, “This
too will pass.” A great silence came over him as he read the sentence,
“This too will pass.” And it passed.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything passes away; nothing remains in this world. The enemies
who were following him must have got lost in the forest, must have moved
on a wrong way; the hooves slowly, slowly were not heard any more.</p><p><br></p><p>The king was immensely grateful to the servant and to the unknown
mystic. Those words proved miraculous. He folded the paper, put it back
into the ring, gathered his armies again and conquered his kingdom back.
And the day he was entering his capital, victorious, there was great
celebration all over the capital, music, dance – and he was feeling very
proud of himself.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man was walking by the side of his chariot. He said, “This
time is also right: look again at the message.”</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, “What do you mean? Now I am victorious, people are
celebrating. I am not in despair, I am not in a situation where there is
no way out.”</p><p><br></p><p>The old man said, “Listen. This is what the saint has said to me:
this message is not only for despair, it is also for pleasure. This is
not only for when you are defeated; it is also for when you are
victorious – not only when you are the last, but also when you are the
first.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the king opened the ring, read the message, “This too will pass,”
and suddenly the same peace, the same silence, amidst the crowds,
jubilating, celebrating, dancing... but the pride, the ego was gone.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything passes away.</p><p><br></p><p>He asked his old servant to come on the chariot and sit with him. He
asked, “Is there anything more? Everything passes away... Your message
has been immensely helpful.”</p><p><br></p><p>The old man said, “The third thing the saint said, ‘Remember,
everything passes. Only you remain; you remain forever as a
witness.’”</p><p><br></p><p>So this is the answer to your question: Everything passes, but you
remain. You are the reality; everything else is just a dream. Beautiful
dreams are there, nightmares are there... But it does not matter whether
it is a beautiful dream or a nightmare; what matters is the one who is
seeing the dream. That seer is the only reality.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East we don’t have anything like philosophy. Scholars have
translated the Eastern word darshan, which means seeing, into philosophy
– finding no other way. But they are not at all connected: philosophy is
thinking, not seeing.</p><p>A blind man can think about light, but cannot see it; the man with
eyes can see the light, there is no need to think about it. In the East
there is nothing comparable to philosophy; in the West there is nothing
comparable to darshan. I have coined my own word to translate darshan,
philosia. Philo means love, and sia means to see. Sophy means thinking,
sia means seeing.</p><p><br></p><p>And the whole East has been working only in one dimension for
centuries: how to find the seer. You cannot go beyond it; that is the
ultimate. Everything is in front of it; it is behind the whole reality,
and everything goes on changing.…</p><p><br></p><p>You are a child, you will become young, you will become old. You are
alive, you will be dead – everything goes on changing.</p><p><br></p><p>But the seer is something absolutely eternal.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a little glimpse of it and all your problems will start
disappearing, because a totally new perspective will arise – a new
vision, a new way of life, a new way of seeing things, seeing people,
responding to situations. And the seer is always present, twenty-four
hours day; whatever you are doing or not doing, it is there. It has been
there for centuries, for eternity, waiting for you to take note of
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps because it has been always there, that’s why you have
forgotten it. The obvious is always forgotten. Remember it when you are
feeling a well-being, a euphoria; remember it when you are in misery, in
anguish. Remember it in all climates, in all moods – go on remembering
it. Soon you will be able to remain centered in it, there will be no
need to remember.</p><p><br></p><p>And that is the greatest day in one’s life. That day you become
enlightened.</p><p>That day you become awakened.</p><p><br></p><p>That day zorba changes into a buddha. Question 2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>IN MY EXPLORATIONS BEFORE TAKING SANNYAS, I WAS INITIATED INTO THE
FOUR MEDITATION TECHNIQUES OF GURU MAHARAJI. I HAD A VERY BEAUTIFUL
EXPERIENCE WITH ONE OF THE TECHNIQUES DURING THE INITIATION SESSION, AND
STILL FIND THE TECHNIQUES SIMPLE AND FASCINATING. HOWEVER, THERE IS MUCH
CONFLICT IN ME ABOUT USING THESE TECHNIQUES SINCE I HAVE BECOME A
SANNYASIN. AND I NEVER FELL IN LOVE WITH GURU MAHARAJI LIKE I FELL IN
LOVE WITH YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>CAN YOU PLEASE GIVE SOME GUIDANCE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT IS OKAY FOR
ME TO CONTINUE PRACTICING THESE TECHNIQUES WHILE BEING A SANNYASIN – OR
SHOULD I DROP THEM?</p><p>ALSO, I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT GURU
MAHARAJI.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no problem. If you feel good with any technique you can
continue it. From where it comes does not matter, who has given it to
you does not matter. If it gives you pleasant feelings, a certain
silence, serenity, continue it.</p><p><br></p><p>Being my sannyasin does not mean that I monopolize you. Being my
sannyasin means now the whole world is yours; enjoy everything that
feels good for yourself – but remember what I was just talking about. A
pleasant feeling is not real meditation, because that too will pass
away. It is only a technique. I want to give you something that does not
pass away. Meanwhile you can play with all kinds of toys, there is no
harm.</p><p><br></p><p>And you are asking about Guru Maharaji. First I will tell you a small
story; perhaps it explains Guru Maharaji to you. It is a Tibetan
story.…</p><p><br></p><p>A man who later on became very famous as a saint was searching for
truth. He came across a so- called master who had a great following,
whose only teaching was: “Surrender to me and surrender totally, and I
will take you to the ultimate state of consciousness. Don’t be worried,
at the right time the explosion will happen.” It had not happened to
anyone.</p><p><br></p><p>But in the East, one life is not enough to realize oneself. It takes
thousands of lives to find the right moment, the right time when the
explosion happens. So nobody can complain, “I have been waiting for
thirty years and it has not happened.” Thirty years or thirty lives
don’t count.</p><p><br></p><p>But this man really, totally surrendered. And the second day the
disciples were amazed because he was walking on water. They could not
believe their eyes; they asked the man, “What is the secret?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You must know it because you have been with the master so
long. I surrendered totally, I trust him, I just repeat his name and
leave everything to him, and anything becomes possible. I can pass
through fire, I can walk on water, I can jump from high mountains. You
look surprised,” he said. “In fact, I should be surprised that you
cannot, and you have been here for years with a great master.”</p><p><br></p><p>They rushed to the master. They said, “This man is strange. He is
walking on water, and he says it is the power of your name. He simply
repeats your name and he can do anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>The master himself was surprised, but he did not show his surprise to
the disciples. He said, “That’s what you should all be doing. If your
surrender is total, my name can take you to ultimate liberation.” But
deep down he was thinking that when everybody is gone, he is going to
try repeating his own name and walk on water. Because if that other guy
in just one day is doing such a miracle, “then what miracles can I not
do? I was not aware...” So he repeated his name, walked into the water
and started drowning.</p><p><br></p><p>With difficulty he was saved, and his disciples said, “What
happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Call that strange man and let me see how he walks, because
if I cannot walk repeating my own name, how can he?” The man came and he
walked on water.</p><p>The master said, “You jump from the mountain, thousands of feet high,
deep into the valley.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man jumped, and they had to walk down for hours to reach him.
They were thinking they were not going to find a single bone
unfractured, that the man must be splattered all over the place – but he
was sitting in a lotus posture under a tree looking so beautiful. He
said, “Great master, your name is such a miracle!”</p><p><br></p><p>The master had to fall at his feet. He said, “Forgive me, I’m not a
master at all; I’m just a charlatan. I have been cheating people,
exploiting people, but I cannot exploit you. Your trust prohibits
me.”</p><p><br></p><p>People like Guru Maharaji belong to the same category as that master.
If they repeat their own name, they will start drowning in the water.
The technique they have given to you, which is giving you a certain
peace and silence, has not given them any peace, any silence.</p><p><br></p><p>I know the man, I used to know his father. His father was also doing
the same thing – pretending to be a mystic. He trained this boy, Guru
Maharaji – who was just six years old at that time – to memorize a few
scriptures, and that became a great attraction. He would recite
scriptures in pure Sanskrit.</p><p><br></p><p>His father used to say, “In his past life he was a great master; he
still remembers these things from his past life” – and I know this was
not true. The master, the father of Guru Maharaji, was not at ease with
his wife – just as nobody is at ease.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked the wife... and she said, “He is a cheat, and now he is
training his children to be cheats. He has spoiled this boy; now he is
spoiling the other boy.”</p><p><br></p><p>And just because he was six or seven years old, thousands of people
would come to listen, believing that it was the memory of his past
life.</p><p><br></p><p>When the father died he announced, “This boy, Guru Maharaji, will be
my successor.” Guru Maharaji became world famous – but he was only
sixteen when he became world famous, and a boy of sixteen naturally fell
in love with a girl. I don’t see any objection to it. But his mother,
who had always been against the father for spoiling the children, was
now doing the same. Those children proved to be a great business.</p><p><br></p><p>But the mother was very angry. In India, if a man has some
spirituality then he has to be celibate – and he had fallen in love with
an American girl. Not only that, he got married. He was not of an age to
get married; the girl was twenty-one years old, he was sixteen years
old. He had to appear before a court to get the permission of the judge,
that he was mature enough.</p><p><br></p><p>The judge said, “There is no question about your maturity. You are
world famous. You can get married.”</p><p><br></p><p>This marriage created trouble. The mother renounced the boy and
renounced that he was the successor to his father. She said, “The second
boy is the real successor.” So now the empire is divided into two, the
smaller boy and the mother in the East, and Guru Maharaji in
America.</p><p>When he went to India, the followers of his own brother and mother
threw stones, protested against him, and he had to leave India because
of them. They would not allow him to stay there – and he is doing the
same thing with his mother and his brother when they come to America.
These people are simply business people; religion to them is nothing but
business.</p><p><br></p><p>But this has been so for centuries: exploit the innocent, exploit the
ignorant, exploit the miserable, exploit people who are in suffering, in
anguish and anxiety.</p><p><br></p><p>I have no problem. If you can walk on water with the name of Guru
Maharaji you can do it; you should not feel any conflict – because I
don’t have any conflict with anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>Your question may be important for other people also, because many
other people may have learned something from some other sources. There
is no need to be worried. Sometimes it happens that the source may be
wrong but what you have got is right. The master may be fake but he has
got some techniques, handed down to him by heritage, which are
significant.</p><p><br></p><p>But remember, every technique can only give you an experience; I want
to give you the experiencer, not the experience. Experience comes and
goes; don’t rely on it. Unless you have found the experiencer... Who is
feeling joy? Who is feeling pain? Who is feeling well-being? Who is
feeling sad?</p><p><br></p><p>Who is this consciousness?</p><p><br></p><p>Every effort should be to reach to this innermost center of the
cyclone. Your whole life is a cyclone of change, of changing scenes,
changing colors, but just in the middle of the cyclone there is a silent
center. That is you.</p><p><br></p><p>My effort is to help you to find yourself. Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>I ALWAYS FEEL THAT I FIND A WRONG LOVER, ALWAYS SOMETHING DOESN’T FIT
WELL AND I FEEL FRUSTRATED. PLEASE, I NEED YOUR MESSAGE.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the problem everybody is facing... if not today, then
tomorrow. Something is always missing, something seems to be wrong,
something is not fitting; all lovers throughout history have the same
problem. One has to go really deep into it, because it is not one man’s
problem or one woman’s problem.</p><p><br></p><p>In the first place we are all living lives according to fictions,
poetries, film stories. That has given humanity a wrong impression, the
impression that when there is love everything will fit, that there will
be no conflict. For centuries poets have been giving the idea that
lovers are made for each other.</p><p>Nobody is made for anybody else. Everybody is different from
everybody else.</p><p>You may love a person without knowing that you love the person only
because there is so much difference between you, so much distance. The
distance is a challenge, the distance is an adventure; the distance
makes the woman or the man worth getting hold of. But things as they
appear from a distance are not the same when they come close.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are just courting a man or a woman, everything is beautiful,
everything fits – because both want that everything should fit. Anything
that does not fit is not allowed to surface; it is repressed in the
unconscious. So lovers sitting on the beach looking at the moon do not
know each other at all. The marriage is almost finished before the
honeymoon is finished.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good that in the East there is nothing like a honeymoon; they
don’t give the chance for the marriage to be finished so soon. In the
East people go on living together and never feel the way you are feeling
– that things are not fitting, something is missing, there is no chance
at all. Husbands and wives do not choose for themselves; marriages are
organized by the parents, by the astrologers, by all kinds of people
except the two who are going to be married.</p><p><br></p><p>The couple cannot see each other in the daylight, they can only meet
each other deep in the darkness of the night. And their two families are
big, so they can talk only in whispers; fighting is out of the question.
Throwing clothes will not work – no woman, no man in the East knows that
clothes have to be thrown; otherwise, what kind of love affair are you
having? Or that plates have to be broken, or that for each and every
thing you have to argue – you say one thing and the woman understands
something else; she says something, you understand something else...</p><p><br></p><p>There seems to be no communication.</p><p><br></p><p>And it starts with the honeymoon, because there for the first time
you are together twenty-four hours a day. Now you cannot pretend; you
have to be real. You cannot act.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my friends was saying that he went to see a movie with his
wife. He saw in the movie the actor, the hero kissing his beloved with
so much joy, with such ecstasy that the wife told my friend, “Look! You
never kiss me like that.”</p><p><br></p><p>And my friend said, “Darling, that is acting. I can also act, but to
be with you twenty-four hours a day and still kiss you with so much
ecstasy – I am not that mad.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman said, “You don’t understand me at all. Here they are
acting, but in real life the woman is his wife too.”</p><p><br></p><p>My friend said, “My God, then he must be a real actor.” I have
heard...</p><p>One honeymoon couple came to the beach to stay in a hotel for a few
days, but there seemed to be some difficulty. As they closed the door of
their room, the husband said, “First, put the light off before you go to
the bathroom.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman said, “Why?”</p><p>The man said, “I don’t like lights. You just put the lights off, then
you go to the bathroom, change your dress and come back.”</p><p><br></p><p>But she said, “I cannot come in darkness. It is an unknown room; I
may stumble on some furniture or something. That I cannot do.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “This seems to be a difficulty. You will have to do
it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman said, “I don’t understand the stubbornness. Just for five
minutes you cannot remain in the light? You can close your eyes.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “It is better to tell you the truth, because sooner or
later I will have to tell you. One of my legs is artificial and I don’t
want you to see. I wanted to put it away in darkness down the side of
the bed.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman said, “That’s good that you told me. If you are so honest,
I should be honest too. Now there is no need for me to go into the
bathroom. I was going to remove both of my breasts; they are false.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now what do you think? Has anything remained, or is everything
finished? When you live together you have to be real to the other
person; you cannot hide, you cannot have any secrets. And we have been
given the idea from our very childhood that between wife and husband
there is always harmony, everything is always fitting, they are always
together, always loving, no fight. That whole ideology is the
problem.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like to tell you the truth. The truth is that both the
persons, whoever they are, are different individuals. If you love
somebody, you have to understand it that you are going to love somebody
who is not your shadow, who is not your reflection in the mirror, who
has his own individuality.</p><p><br></p><p>Unless you have a big enough heart to accommodate somebody who is
different from you, who may have different ideas about different things,
you should not get into unnecessary trouble. It is better to become a
monk or a nun. Why bother? Why create hell for yourself and the other?
But the hell is created because you expect heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>I am telling you to accept that this is the situation: the person is
going to be different. You are not the master, neither is the other the
master; both are simply partners who have decided, in spite of all
differences, to be together. And in fact, differences add spice to your
love. If you can find a woman who is just like you, you will not find
much attraction in her. The woman has to be different, distant, a
mystery that invites you to explore; the same is true about the man.</p><p><br></p><p>But with two mysteries meeting together, once they drop the idea that
they have to agree on everything, there is no question of any fight. The
fight arises because you want agreement.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are living just like two friends – she has her own ideas, you
have your own ideas, she respects your ideas, you respect her ideas; she
has her way, you have your own way and nobody is trying to impose on and
indoctrinate the other – then there is no question of fight. And then
there is no question that things are not fitting – why should they be
fitting? – that something is missing.</p><p>Nothing is missing; it is just that your idea of harmony is not
there. Harmony is not something very great, it is boring. Once in a
while, even if you fight, once in a while even if you get really hot,
that does not mean that love disappears; that simply means love is
capable of absorbing even disagreements, fights, overcoming all these
hindrances. Just the old kind of ideology, of man and woman.…</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of the old biblical story which is not told very much
because it is very dangerous. First, God made one man and one woman. But
as you know by looking at the world, God does not seem to be very
intelligent. Here, nothing is fitting; from the very beginning you can
see it. He made man and woman, two persons, and gave them a small bed –
not a double bed.</p><p><br></p><p>The very first night – in the beginning of the world – was the night
of a tremendous fight, because the woman wanted to sleep on the bed. The
man wanted that he should sleep on the bed and she should sleep on the
floor. The whole night they went on fighting, beating each other,
throwing things... and in the morning the man said to God, “I asked you
to give me a companion but I did not ask you to give me an enemy. If you
think this is a companion... I was better alone. I don’t want this
woman; there is never going to be peace between me and her.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now the simple thing was to ask for a double bed. I don’t understand
what kind of God that was, and what these idiots were asking. The simple
question was of a double bed, or two single beds; if things were getting
too bad then two single beds. But instead of that he said, “I don’t want
this woman; she is trying to be equal to me.” The male chauvinist idea
arose that very night.</p><p><br></p><p>And God dismantled the woman – naturally, because God is also a male
chauvinist. He dismantled the woman just the way you dismantle any
mechanism. He destroyed the woman and said, “Now I will make another
woman who will be lower than you and will never ask for equality.” Then
he made the second woman, who was Eve, by taking one of the ribs from
Adam. And out of the rib he made the woman – so that she cannot ask for
equality, she is nothing but a rib.</p><p><br></p><p>But you cannot manage things like this. Just a little intelligence
would have been enough; this way things have not changed. It is said
that every night when Adam would come back home and go to sleep, Eve
would count his ribs – because she was always afraid that if he loses
any other rib, that means another woman is also somewhere around.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need for more than friendship. Love has to be a friendly
affair in which nobody is superior, in which nobody is going to decide
about things, in which both are fully aware that they are different,
that their approach towards life is different, that they think
differently, and still – with all these differences – they love each
other.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you will not find any problems. Problems are created by us.</p><p>Don’t try to create something superhuman. Be human: accept the other
person’s humanity with all the frailty humanity is prone to. She will
commit mistakes just as you commit mistakes – and you have to learn. To
be together is a great learning – of forgiving, of forgetting, of
understanding that the other is as human as you are. Just a little
forgiveness...</p><p>There is an old proverb: “To err is human and to forgive is divine.”
I don’t agree. To err is human and to forgive is also human. To forgive
is divine? – then you are raising it too high, beyond human reach. Bring
it within human reach and learn to forgive. Learn to enjoy forgiveness,
learn to ask for an apology; you don’t lose anything when you can say to
your woman, “I’m sorry, I was wrong.”</p><p><br></p><p>But no man wants to say, “I was wrong.” He is always right. No woman
wants to say that she was wrong; she is always right. Man tries to prove
through arguments that he is right; the woman tries through emotions to
prove that she is right – screaming, crying, weeping, tears. And she
WINS... The man becomes afraid of the neighbors, and just to cool her
down – because the children may wake up – he says, “Cool down, perhaps
you are right.” But deep down he still believes he is right.</p><p><br></p><p>To be understanding means that you can be wrong, the woman may be
right. It is not a guarantee that just by being man you have the power
and authority to be right; neither has the woman. If we were just a
little more human and a little more friendly, and we could say to each
other, “We are sorry...” And what are the things you are fighting for? –
so small, so trivial that if somebody asks you, you will feel
embarrassed.</p><p><br></p><p>Just drop the idea that everything has to fit, drop the idea that
there is going to be total harmony – because those are not good ideas.
If everything fits you will get bored with each other; if everything is
harmonious you will lose the whole juice of the relationship. It is good
that things don’t fit. It is good that there is always a gap so there is
always something to explore, something to cross over, some bridge to be
made. The whole life can be a tremendous exploration of each other if we
accept the differences, the basic uniqueness of each individual, and we
make love not a kind of slavery but a friendship.</p><p><br></p><p>Try friendship, try friendliness; and remember always, there is
nothing that is going to disturb you. When you see a beautiful woman,
you feel attracted; you should understand that when your wife sees a
beautiful man, she must be feeling attracted. If you are understanding,
you will both discuss, lovingly, what a beautiful woman she was, and
what a beautiful man he was.</p><p><br></p><p>But right now the situation is that you can see from miles away
whether the couple coming is married or unmarried. With the married
couple, the husband moves very cautiously and very carefully; he does
not look here and there – as if he has got some neck problem. And the
wife is watching where he is looking, what he is looking at, and taking
note of everything. This is ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>I was traveling – I was going to Kashmir – and in my compartment
there was a beautiful woman. Her husband was coming to her every station
with ice cream and with bananas, with apples. In Kashmir, fruits are
really juicy.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked the woman, “How long have you been married?” She said, “Seven
years.”</p><p>I said, “Don’t lie to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “What do you mean? Why should I lie to you.”</p><p>I said, “After seven years the husband is not going to come to every
station with all these things. He is not your husband.”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “How did you come to know?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “How did I come to know? I can see it. If he was your
husband, once he had dropped you in this compartment, then only on the
last station – if you are fortunate – he would come back; otherwise he
would escape. Why should he come to you every station with all these
things?”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “Strange, but you are right. He is not my husband; he is my
friend’s husband, but he loves me. And what you are saying about
husbands is true. That has happened between me and my husband. We live
together but we are miles apart; I am thinking to divorce him.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Don’t do that. Go on living with him and go on loving this
man, and don’t let this man divorce his wife. She will be loving
somebody else, don’t be worried. Existence takes care of things. But if
you divorce your husband and you get married to this man, you will not
get these ice creams and these fruits and this attention and this love –
all will disappear.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you are just friendly and don’t make your friendliness a legal
affair of husband and wife, things will be far better – because you are
not a burden to anybody, not a bondage to anybody. There is no question
of fitting with each other. You can have your individuality totally free
from each other, and yet be in love.</p><p><br></p><p>And really to be totally different in individuality creates the best
possibility of love. Okay, Maneesha.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part16>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

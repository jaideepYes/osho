HOW CAN YOU SAY WITH SUCH CERTAINTY THAT THIS EARTH IS THE ONLY PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE LIFE HAS BLOSSOMED, AND CONSCIOUSNESS HAS ARISEN?\nHOW DO YOU KNOW?\nIt is not an esoteric question; it belongs to the inner science of man. The moment one becomes enlightened, he is no longer confined in his own body; his vision is as big as the whole universe.\nSo when I said that this earth is the only place where life has blossomed, where not only life but consciousness has arisen, not only that but there have been a few people who have reached to the ultimate expression of consciousness – to me, that is godliness – I can say it with authority because it is my own vision. But a few things have to be added to it.\nThere are almost fifty thousand planets in the whole universe where life has reached to the animal stage... some planets where life has only reached to the vegetable state. But there is no planet other than earth where there exists something similar to man – not only alive... Animals are alive, but man is conscious of his life. To become conscious of one’s consciousness is the highest stage, and that is not far away.\nYou are aware of your life.\nYou can be aware of your awareness.\nSelf-awareness will reveal you the mystery of existence.\nYou have not to accept it on my word. If you accept it, it becomes esoteric for you. To me it is an actual experience, and there are many experiences which I am not telling you about for the simple reason that they will look esoteric – because you cannot conceive of them. To me they are realities, but to you they have to become realities.\nI mention this point especially, because I am immensely concerned that life on the earth is not destroyed; it is existence’s most ambitious flight.\nYou are not alive; existence is alive in you.\nYou are not conscious; existence has become conscious in you. The moment you become conscious of consciousness, existence achieves its fulfillment. You are so blessed in that moment that you can bless the whole universe; that is the meaning of the word ‘Bhagwan’. It does not mean God; it simply means the blessed one, one who is blessed and who is capable now to share his blessing with anybody who is ready to receive it.\nThere is nothing esoteric in it, but it belongs to the science of the inner journey – it is not part of the objective science. So to those who are addicted with the objective science it may look esoteric, but to those who are not addicted to the objective... and remember that the object cannot exist alone without your subjectivity; your subject, your consciousness, is the polarity.\nIt is strange that logical scientists go on denying that there is anything inner in man. They accept the outer and they deny the inner; they accept the things in their house and they deny themselves. It is simply ludicrous, but it cannot go on for long. More and more intelligent people are searching inwards because the outer search has led to death – to the ultimate death.\nThe inner search will lead you to deeper layers of life and finally to the eternal life in the same way as the outer search leads you to death, because objects are dead. Studying dead objects, and denying the living subject who is studying them... Do you think one object can study another object? – that is impossible. Do you think one stone can observe another stone? Can it do research about the other stone?\nTo enquire into the objective world, you need an inner consciousness, a subjectivity. That subjectivity is your consciousness. And objective science has come to nuclear weapons, ready to destroy the whole of life on the earth and turn it into pure objectivity without any subject. Just the opposite happens when you reach to your innermost being: everything becomes alive, conscious. The whole existence becomes a dancing, singing, rejoicing universe, and your vision has no limits; you can see things which are not possible with objective eyes.\nI had to state this just to emphasize the fact that to destroy life on the earth is going to be the greatest loss to existence, because nowhere else has it evolved to the point where a Zorba can become a Buddha. Nowhere else has it blossomed into the ultimate potential, transforming it into an actuality.\nGalileo proved that this small earth moves around the sun. It may be a factual thing, but I say unto you that the whole universe, not only the sun but the millions of other suns which you see as stars in the night, and millions of solar systems are all really moving around the earth – not factually, but in a symbolic sense because this is the only sacred place where life exists, where consciousness exists, and where a few people have been capable of achieving the ultimate expression of being, enlightenment.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nSOMEHOW I CAN’T BELIEVE MY LAUGHTER, IF IT’S TRUE, BUT I ALWAYS BELIEVE IN MY TEARS. PLEASE COMMENT.\nEverybody does it; mankind has been accustomed to misery. Misery is taken for granted; it is thought to be natural. Not to be miserable is dangerous in this vast crowd of miserable people simply because they cannot believe that someone is not miserable – something must be wrong with him.\nThe society has penetrated deep in your mind; it is not only that others will not believe your laughter, you yourself don’t. Your mind is part of the society; it has created it. Your parents, teachers, priests – they all have created your mind. A mind is something implanted in you by the society; it belongs to the society, not to you. It is society suspecting your laughter, making you afraid that perhaps you’ve gone insane – because there is no reason to laugh.\nIt is a very strange situation: when you are healthy, you don’t think that there has to be a reason to be healthy. You don’t rush to a doctor in panic saying, “Save me doctor, I am healthy! Do something immediately... something has gone wrong, I am no longer sick.” Nobody asks, “Why am I healthy?” But if you are sick you ask, “Why am I sick?”; you go to the expert to enquire about your sickness and how to cure it.\nThe same should be the situation about your inner world. Sadness is sickness, and you accept it; laughter is health, and you are afraid to accept it – you are suspicious of it. That suspicion is not yours; that suspicion belongs to your mother, to your father, to your teachers, to your priest, the church, and all kinds of so-called leaders.\nIf a child is not burdened with all this conditioning, when he is laughing he will accept it naturally. When he is sad he will enquire about why he is sad. He will go to the psychiatrist to enquire what is the cause of his sadness, why he is so serious, why he cannot laugh, why he cannot sing and dance.\nA person who cannot laugh, cannot sing, cannot dance – do you think he will be able to love? It is impossible; his love will be a sad affair, full of tears, without any joy.\nPeople are finding lovers so that they don’t feel lonely. Loneliness hurts, but they are not aware that the other person is also lonely. And two lonelinesses together make the problem multiplied; it does not dissolve the problem. You were lonely; now another person is lonely. You were sad;\nnow another person is sad. Now both will be carrying the sadnesses of each other, sicknesses, seriousness, moods of despair and anguish – now they are doubled. Before a person falls in love, he should have a right understanding about his own state... is he capable of loving? He cannot laugh, he cannot sing, he cannot enjoy music; he cannot enjoy anything... how is he going to enjoy love?\nThe priests of all the religions have poisoned everything.\nThey have poisoned your love, they have poisoned your laughter. They have poisoned your capacity to rejoice, to dance, to sing.\nJust look at your churches... The moment you enter a church you become serious – just watch it. The moment you enter a church the climate inside you changes – you become serious. You become Christian, which is simply a disease just like Hinduism, Buddhism... different names of diseases.\nCan you make love in a church? Jesus Christ hanging on the cross looking at you... It will be a very strange scene. You cannot even laugh. Have you seen any statue of Jesus smiling, laughing, dancing? No, all that you know is the crucified Jesus.\nMy own understanding is that Christianity has become the biggest religion of the world because it is a sick religion – more sick than any other religion. The cross and a serious Jesus – naturally, on the cross one has to be serious! It will look really odd if he starts laughing on the cross; he has to follow etiquette. His seriousness, his death, his cross have been helpful to millions of miserable people to join his company: “He seems to be the right person.”\nHe has told you to carry your crosses on your own shoulders, and you are carrying not wooden crosses, but far more deep psychological crosses of sadness, misery, anguish, anxiety, meaninglessness. These are your crosses. His cross was not that big, and it was something outside him; you are carrying your crosses within your hearts. There seems to be some kind of affinity between you and Jesus Christ.\nThe writer of ZORBA THE GREEK, Kazantzakis was expelled by the Greek Orthodox church because he created Zorba – a man full of joy, full of love, a man full of music, carrying no cross at all – a fiction even, and one of the best that this century has created. And the great artist Kazantzakis was expelled from the church because he had done something immensely unchristian.\nThe church does not want you to be happy. Society does not want you to be happy. The psychoanalyst does not want you to be happy. Nobody seems to be interested in your happiness; everybody wants you to be miserable. There must be some vested interest in your misery – there is: the miserable man is easily enslaved. He is already broken. He has no guts left; he cannot fight, he cannot rebel; he cannot be a revolutionary, he has no hope. It does not matter to him; he is in such misery, what more misery can slavery be?\nIndia remained for two thousand years in slavery without a single revolution worth calling a revolution. They call a few things... in 1942 Mahatma Gandhi called his movement a revolution. It is simply untrue. The whole revolution died in nine days. And a country of four hundred million people... How\nmany people participated in the revolution? And why did it die out in nine days? These are not revolutions, just little efforts towards revolution which died before they were born.\nIndia was not ready for any revolution; hence, the masses remained aloof – for them it mattered nothing. They were under the kingdom of Hindu kings before Mohammedans came; they were miserable. Mohammedans became emperors; they were miserable. Britishers came; they remained miserable. Their misery does not change. Why should they bother who is ruling them? Their hearts are so deeply sad that you cannot make them sadder.\nAll governments want people to remain miserable, and all priests want people to remain miserable, because only miserable people go to the priests for consolation. Only miserable people think of paradise; only miserable people want to be assured that blessed are the poor, blessed are the humble because they shall inherit the kingdom of God.\nFor thousands of years misery has been imposed upon you. You are born into it; it is part of your blood and bones. That is the reason that when you feel laughter, to yourself you look awkward, embarrassed. But tears are perfectly okay, because for thousands of years man has been full of tears – his whole life is nothing but tears.\nMy people are condemned all around the earth. I am condemned for the simple reason that I am telling you to throw the crosses off your shoulders. If you are so much attached to carrying something, carry a guitar – but a cross is not something to be carried.\nI have been teaching my people to be happy, rejoicing, loving, because those are natural things which have been repressed. But strange people have the majority under them. I have told my people to drop all old conceptions. For example, you have been told for centuries that love is unspiritual. Love to God is perfectly okay – that is spiritual love because there is no God, so you can go on praying and be very loving to God who does not exist. But love to a woman or a man is dangerous because the woman is real, the man is real.\nThey have tried to divert your love to a nonexistential thing so you cannot love those who are real. And they have made it clear to you that these two loves are opposite to each other: either you can love a woman or you can love God... strange! I can’t think why there should be such a competition between God and a woman. Is God a woman?... so jealous?\nWhy has a man to renounce life and its joys to attain the same pleasures in heaven? What kind of logic is this? Here everything is sin, and the same things in heaven become rewards, to the same saints who were told not even to look at a woman.\nIn India there was a saint, Surdas, who took his eyes out. His name, Surdas has become equivalent to blind man, because to call a blind man “blind man” looks a little inhuman. In India a blind man is called surdas – the name of a great saint. It simply means a blind man, but looks more sophisticated and does not hurt the blind man. Surdas took out his eyes because he was afraid that if the eyes are there and women are all around... and there are things which are beyond your control. Sometimes you see a face and you like it, you love it. It happens in such a split second that you cannot remember in that second that you are a religious man, you have renounced the world. It is better to get rid of the eyes so you will not see who is man, who is woman, who is beautiful. And this is not an exception.\nIn the Soviet Union before the revolution, there were thousands of men and women – a very fanatic Christian cult which demanded that you cut your genitals. And people were cutting their genitals to assure the church absolutely about their chastity, celibacy. The poor woman was again at a loss what to cut... the man was going far higher in spiritual growth. Then finally they started cutting their breasts. There were thousands of women who had cut their breasts and they were thought to be very religious. Men who had cut their genitals were thought more religious – they were saints.\nAll these religions have been poisoning your naturality. My effort is to throw any unnatural conditioning off you, and introduce you again to your innocence, to your nature.\nJust the other day my secretary Anando reported to me that there are reports in the newspapers that there are sexual orgies here. I said, “But I am here, and you don’t invite me either. Great things are happening and I am present, and I have to come to know about great things through newspapers. This is not right.”\nShe said, “But no orgies are happening. These are all false reports.”\nI looked into the report and I found what the reason was. It must have come from the hotels and places where my people are staying. No orgies are happening anywhere, but this is part of my teaching: whatever you do, do totally. So when my people are making love, they really love. They groan, they moan, they scream, they dance, they sing. And, you know, the hotel walls are not very thick, so all the neighbors are keeping their ears to what is happening... It must be an orgy! Two persons making so much noise... not possible!\nThey also make love, but they make love according to the tradition that the woman should not move. And to prevent her movement the man is on top of the woman. Now this is beast over the beauty – he’s muscular, he’s bigger, and the poor delicate woman is simply crushed under him. What kind of love...? And he is in a hurry to finish it soon because it is a sin – the sooner finished the better! You should not rejoice in it, you should not prolong it, and your neighbors should not know. So the woman remains quiet, silent, almost a corpse. That is the definition of a lady.\nA lady is not a woman. A lady is a dead woman; a lady simply means a good lay, she simply lies down and remains with closed eyes.\nAnd do you know why women close their eyes when you make love? – just to avoid seeing you. You are doing such a nasty thing to them, they don’t want to see; they don’t want the light on. The man is finished within seconds, because only he is making movements.\nNeither the man attains orgasm nor the woman attains orgasm. Orgasm needs a little more articulateness, a little more skill. Orgasm needs first a long foreplay – unless sex is accepted as natural, it is not possible – a foreplay with incense burning, a music record going on, Irene Pappas singing! And before you start making love – love should not be an immediate thing – you should dance, you should sing, you should prepare your bodies to rejoice, you should prepare your bodies for the thrill. And waiting is a thrill.\nYou should make love only when it happens naturally, listening to music, dancing, the beautiful fragrance of incense, flowers... Your love chamber should be a temple. I cannot use the word ‘church’; it is too ugly. That’s why I am using the word ‘temple’.\nAnd when your energies are flowing, moving, enjoying and your whole bodies are ready – not just your minds which want to make love... The woman certainly needs her whole body to be ready because her whole body is orgasmic.\nMan’s sexuality is local, genital; woman’s sexuality is all over her body. So by dancing and singing, her whole body will be throbbing, will be getting ready, will be getting warmer. The lady will be disappearing and the woman will be coming back.\nOf course the lady should be on top, never the man on top. That is inhuman. And that is purely according to sexual science, that the man should be under the woman because then he cannot move much, and if he cannot move much then his ejaculation will not be within three seconds, it will take time. Let the woman move. And when you are in joy, you shout, you scream, you moan, you groan, and you don’t care about the neighbors. Then only it is possible for both to come to an orgasm.\nOrgasm is a gift of nature that leads you to religiousness, because through orgasm you come to know a unity with existence. For a moment you disappear, time stops, mind functions no more... all is silent and all is beautiful; but it is only for moments. But once you have tasted it, you would like it to remain with you twenty-four hours.\nThe first man who must have discovered meditation... I am absolutely certain that the discovery was made through orgasm, because there is no other way to discover meditation. In orgasm all those basic elements are present which make meditation. And some adventurer, enquirer, must have thought, “Why am I feeling so euphoric, so ecstatic?” And he must have noted these three points: I disappear – a certain am-ness remains, a certain is-ness remains, but there is no I. Time disappears – there is no past, no future, just the moment, the present. Mind disappears – no thoughts.\nAnybody with a little intelligence could have figured out that if these three things can be managed without making love then the same experience will happen. This is the origin of meditation. Nobody knows how many thousand years ago some unknown explorer – the greatest explorer in the world – found it out, but it worked. Because with love you are always dependent on the other person, and for two persons there is a certain kind of dependence on each other.\nMeditation manages to make you egoless, to bring you to the present moment, and to stop the thought process – and you have a far bigger orgasm without any sex involved in it. Once you have the key in your hands you can remain twenty-four hours in your inner being in the same bliss, in the same benediction.\nSo my teachings look very contradictory to people – they are not. I teach you to make love as totally as possible so that you can transcend it, so that you can find by yourself what is making love such a joyful event – but it is only for moments. Those three ingredients which constitute orgasm you can try separately, and that’s how I have managed meditation. Those three ingredients you can attain. And once you can have an orgasmic experience alone, you are free from women, you are free from men, you are directly in contact with existence – there is no mediator. Only such a person can go beyond sex.\nGoing beyond sex does not mean that sex was sin. In fact, sex was the cause of all the spirituality\nthat arose out of it. So even the man who has gone beyond sex can enjoy sex just for fun, once in a while. Sex is not against spirituality.\nWhen you have experienced orgasm in sex, don’t forget the afterplay. Just as there is foreplay which brings you to a thrilling readiness, after orgasm, if you turn your side and you say, “Now I am feeling sleepy,” this is insulting. You don’t understand the woman; your sex is only genital. Once you have ejaculated you start feeling sleepy because you have lost energy, you have become dull. Sleep will rejuvenate you so the natural cycle seems to be falling into sleep. But the woman’s whole body was involved – she is still throbbing.\nModern sexology has come to understand that a woman is capable of multiple orgasms – one after another, at least six orgasms – and you have given her only one orgasm. She is still ready for five orgasms, and this is an ordinary situation: the husband goes to sleep, and the wife cries and weeps.\nIf the husband is more considerate – and he should be more considerate to a woman who has given him such a beautiful experience... He should be considerate: afterplay, a little more music, a little more song, a little more playfulness, or just lying down together. She will cool down; she will again become a lady. Unless she becomes a lady, you are not supposed to go to sleep; when she becomes a lady you can say goodbye and go to sleep.\nSo I know from where those reports are coming. My people are staying in hotels and they must be making a racket. And I don’t want you to prevent your rackets – it is your private affair; it is your private room. You are paying for it. Now what you do in the room is your business; it is not the business of the bishop.\nBasically, my insistence is on totality. Whatever you do be total in it, be natural in it, and soon you will discover that laughter and joy are natural. Sometimes you may like just to dance for no reason, just because you are so full of energy and the energy wants to dance. Then don’t prevent it, don’t repress it, because every repressed energy becomes poisonous.\nExpress it, and don’t be worried about the world. Take one thing for granted: since you have been with me, the world knows you are crazy. Now there is no problem. They know you are crazy; you need not be worried about them. You be crazily in love with life, nature, so that you can transcend both life and nature. And there is a transcendence waiting for you, but it is only for those who live totally.\nThen tears may also come, but they will not be of sadness; they will be of joy, they will be of gratitude, they will be of sheer blissfulness.\nTears are a language of anything overflowing.\nIf you are so full of sadness then your tears are of sadness. If you are so full of joy the tears will be of joy.\nI am not saying prevent the tears; they have their own beauty.\nBut they should be of joy, they should be of love, they should come out of your silence, out of your peace, out of your heart in tremendous gratitude that existence has given you life, has given you consciousness, and has given you a crazy friend like me.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHAT IS THE ESSENCE OF PATIENCE?\nPatience has been exploited by people.\nThere has been poverty for centuries and people have been told just to be patient, “It is a test of your trust in God.” They have been told just to be patient, “It is only a question of a few years and then you will be entering into paradise.”\nPatience has been used as part of an exploitation of people in every field, but patience itself is a beautiful quality.\nYou should not allow your patience to be exploited.\nBut to be patient, to me means trust – trust in nature, trust in existence, trust in yourself. Things are going to be better every day; whatever happens, your patience finds in it something better for you. It is a very great alchemy; it changes suffering into blessing. It is a great instrument in your hands, you just have to understand that the instrument has to be used by you, not by others on you.\nThere are continuous changes in life – life is a flux. Heraclitus says, “You cannot step twice in the same river.”\nI say to you, “You cannot even step once in the same river.”\nThe river is continuously moving... There are ups, there are downs, there are days and there are nights.\nPatience consists of seeing things in a way that everything becomes a joy to you. For example, you can see that every day has been sandwiched between two dark nights. That will give you good misery and sadness – what a life it is... just a small day and two big, dark nights.\nA man of understanding will see that every night is so small between two beautiful sunny days. Life is the same – your outlook changes. There are people who will not look at the roseflower, they will look at the thorns. They will be in deep despair that existence cannot even produce roses without thorns, but they are paying more attention to thorns than to roses.\nA man of understanding will love the rose, and will take the thorn as a protection for the rose. It is a protection; the same rosebush is supplying juice to both – to the rose and to the thorn. The thorn must have some natural function. Its function is to protect the rose – it is a soldier, a guard.\nOnce you see life just from a different angle, your heart starts throbbing in a different way. Everything can be looked at with negative eyes, and there are people who will think about everything with negative eyes; they may become good critics, but they will be utter failures in life. There is a way to see life with positive eyes.\nI was visiting a palace in Jaipur in India. Jaipur is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. The man who was creating it, Maharaja Jai Singh, wanted to defeat Paris, but he died before he could complete the project. So Jaipur has remained incomplete, but it has tremendous beauty. No city in India has that quality.\nI was visiting his palace. His grandson, who is now in the place of the grandfather, said to me, “Please, don’t take note if you see something incomplete in the palace.”\nI said, “What is the matter?”\nHe said, “My grandfather had a certain idea that nothing should be made complete, that then it has a certain kind of deadness; something should remain incomplete... possibilities for growth. And by coincidence he could not complete Jaipur. He died. And this was his whole life’s philosophy; he never made anything complete. Something will be missing in it, and the people who come with negative eyes immediately see the missing thing. The whole palace is so beautiful, but their whole concern becomes concentrated on a small stone that is missing, and they become frustrated.” Perhaps Maharaja Jai Singh had some understanding of life.\nIn life nothing is perfect, everything has some imperfection.\nImperfection means life is still growing, evolution is still happening. The day everything is complete will be the worst day in existence, because that day everything will become dead. There will be no growth, no need for evolution; everything will be stuck. Don’t look to the imperfections; look at so much beauty that surrounds small imperfections.\nIt is a change of perspective that brings patience to you. Then you know that everything is good, and everything is going to be better because it has been going on for centuries becoming better and better. There is no need to be worried about tomorrow; tomorrow is going to be better.\nThe whole existence is involved in bettering itself.\nYou have to be just a little patient, you should not be in a hurry. You should not ask that everything should be given to you right now.\nEverything comes in its own time. Everything comes when you are ripe.\nEverything comes when you deserve it – this is my experience.\nIn the last thirty years I have not felt, even for a single moment, any impatience, and I have seen that everything goes on becoming better. Existence itself is involved; we are part of it – there is no\nneed to worry. Even something that looks dark today may prove just the beginning of a new dawn. Before the dawn the night is the darkest.\nJust watch life.\nTry to understand life and patience will come to you on its own accord.\nI was in jail in America. In the first jail the sheriff of the jail asked me, “Perhaps you would never have thought that you would be in a jail.”\nI said, “I keep my future open. I can be anywhere... even in hell I will not be disturbed.”\nHe took me to my cell. He said, “It is unjust. You have been arrested without any warrant, without even giving you any calls – you have not been allowed to inform your attorneys. This is simply unjust. In my whole life I have never seen something like this happening.”\nI said, “This is a good experience for you. Things like this can happen. To me it makes no difference whether the arrest warrant was there or not, I would have been here anyway. And these days I will be in the jail are going to give me a new experience and a new perspective of life which I would have missed.”\nHe said, “You seem to be a little bit of a strange type.”\nI said, “I am. This is only the beginning. We will come to know each other more.”\nAnd just within two days he became so friendly to me that he was worried that soon I would be freed, and “We will miss you forever.” Because in those two days, thousands of telegrams, telephone calls and telexes and flowers came from all over the world, he said, “I have never seen such a thing. In my jail there have been cabinet ministers, secretaries, great politicians. Nobody cares about them but you seem to be really influential all over the world. Now my wife wants to see you, my children want your autograph, and if you don’t mind, I also want your autograph to show to people that you have been in my jail. I am proud that we had the chance to take care of you for two days.”\nHe really took good care. He put me in the hospital ward and when I left, even I started thinking, “Should I leave or not?” because all the nurses were crying. I said, “My God, this is difficult.”\nSix nurses weeping and saying, “We will miss you.”\nI said, “I can understand. I can stay here forever – for me there is no problem – but they won’t let me stay. And you should understand, you are only six; I have left five thousand people in my commune, and one million people around the world who must be crying and weeping. But looking at your faces, it feels like I should forget the world and remain here. I had never thought that jail can be such a beautiful place.”\nThey said, “It never was. It is you who changed it. When so many telegrams and so many telephone calls started coming we realized we had to clean everything because everybody was concerned about your allergy. We had not cleaned for years.”\nThe whole jail was full of flowers. They had no space to put flowers. They started asking me, “What to do? Now flowers go on coming and we don’t have place, and the whole jail looks like a flower shop.”\nEven the old man who had received me into the jail, the head of the jail, had tears in his eyes when he let me out.\nHe said, “We will remember you – in just two days you changed our whole jail. Our inmates have never been so happy. We have five hundred inmates. They all know you because they all see you on television every day, and they are happy that they had a chance to live with you for two days in the same jail. Now it is no longer a jail for them. It has become a pride for them.”\nAfter twelve days being in five jails, when I came out the last U.S. marshal who took me out of the jail said, “This is strange, you are looking better than you looked when we took you to the jail.”\nI said, “That is your fault. What can I do about it? I enjoyed the whole thing. It was such a new experience, and my doctor will be very happy that I have lost eight pounds. Having nothing to do, I was continually walking in the corridors. Not getting my food... I was just taking juice or fruits so it has been tremendously good for my health. And whenever I gain weight again I will inform you and you can arrest me. There is no need of any warrant. There was no warrant this time; next time there is no need for any warrant. And twelve days are not enough! – keep me at least for fifteen days.”\nHe said, “But nobody likes jail.”\nI said, “Who is bothering about the jail? – I like everything. I find something beautiful in it. Sitting in my cell twenty-four hours after thirty years of continually talking to people – this was a great holiday. The nurses were beautiful; they were taking every care, and the inmates were very beautiful. You think them criminals – your bureaucrats are more criminal, more inhuman than the inmates. Wherever I arrived they welcomed me behind the bars showing me the victory sign saying, ‘Osho, don’t be worried, you will be victorious because they are doing absolutely criminal and wrong things. We have been watching you on the television; we are all with you.’”\nThose twelve days are a beautiful memory to me; otherwise the very name ‘jail’ looks bad – it all depends on how you look at things. In the first jail, the jailer became so interested in me and so angry about the injustice that was being done to me, that he allowed a world press conference inside the jail.\nI said, “But it may harm you.”\nHe said, “I don’t care. I have got only two years before being retired; at the most they can retire me now.”\nI asked, “But has there ever been a press conference inside the jail for a prisoner?”\nHe said, “Never, but we will make history.” He invited all the press and we had a beautiful press conference inside the jail.\nThe whole of America was shocked.\nThe government was shocked: “What is the point of keeping this man in jail? He has gained more sympathy from people, and even from jail he is still available to people on television. Millions of people are seeing him who would have never thought about him.”\nThey regretted that they had committed a mistake, and I enjoyed that they committed a mistake. They destroyed the commune. They are fools...\nThey think a commune consists of houses and roads; they don’t understand anything higher than matter.\nMy commune consists of people.\nMy commune consists of people’s love.\nThey cannot destroy it; they have increased it. The number of sannyasins has increased all over the world. And every day it is increasing, for the simple reason that people have become aware that the governments are afraid of me. That means I have some message which can change the whole of society.\nJust be patient and be understanding. Everything always goes on going better and better – that is my experience. Whatever happens, ultimately things turn out even better.\nNow my commune has spread all over the world. The whole credit goes to the fascist government of America.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nI’M A SANNYASIN. WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND ME, I SAY THAT I AM FINISHED WITH MISERY. BUT OSHO, I AM STILL SCARED.\nI can understand your problem. To be finished with misery is going to create troubles for you in a miserable society; that’s what scares you. You become a stranger, an outsider, but don’t be worried. Miserable people can do no harm to you; they are so engrossed in their misery, they cannot do any harm to you.\nThe bishop here in St. Nicholas has been threatening for three weeks that he is going to take a protest march in the city against me. But every time he changes the date. The difficulty is that only a few old women come to this congregation. Now, taking those few old women for a protest march, he will just look like a buffoon. He calls those old ladies “the concerned citizens of St. Nicholas”!\nMy people are moving into the town and nobody is against them. The young people... Because that bishop started finding that the protest seems to be difficult, he started a signature campaign. Naturally, that is easier. If the bishop goes to somebody, just to get rid of him they will sign. But a few young men, seeing that the bishop is gathering signatures against me, have started a campaign\nof collecting signatures for me. Those young men don’t know me, and I don’t know them, but they want me here.\nThe bishop phoned the owner of this house, a famous film director, saying, “We will burn the house, and you will never be forgiven by God for becoming the host to a very dangerous man.”\nAnd the director told him, “You can burn the house because it is old and I am no longer interested in it. But before you bother about me being forgiven or not forgiven by God, you should look just above your head: Katzantzakis’ soul has not forgiven your rotten church. First get forgiveness from Katzantzakis and then think about other people.”\nBut strange things the bishop was asking the director, “Do you think Osho is a messiah?” Perhaps deep down he is also afraid – who knows?\nThe director said, “I do not know, but one thing is certain, that I am always for those who are stoned and I am against those who stone them.”\nThis bishop has no power. He has not even the guts to come here. He is deep down afraid, “Perhaps this man may be a messiah – who knows?” Jesus was not recognized by the Jews as a messiah and they crucified him. Perhaps the people of St. Nicholas don’t know that a messiah has come, and they may be unnecessarily creating a protest march... And this and that...\nWho cares about their protest march? And if he wants to burn the house, I will be in the house and he can come and burn the house. There has been one criminal act by Greece, that against Socrates; now there will be a second criminal charge against Greece. He cannot even come close to here; how is he going to burn the house... with the help of those old ladies? Great revolutionaries he has collected!\nYou need not be scared. You remain in your blissfulness. What you are saying to people is absolutely right, misery is the difference.\nThere are one million sannyasins. Not a single sannyasin has yet been killed by anybody. I received threats every day for thirty years that they are going to kill me. They have even tried three times, made attempts to kill me and failed. What can I do about it? Those are idiots. They should come first and ask me, “How to kill you?” Just as I answer everybody else, I will answer them too and show them the right way, because I don’t want that they should be caught and they should be punished after they have killed me. So I can manage everything for them!\nThree times they have tried and failed – twice in India and once in America. Even the American government failed. They had planted a bomb in the jail, underneath the chair where I was sitting. They should have asked me, “At what time are you coming? – because we have to fix the time bomb at the exact time.” I would have told them; they did not ask me. I arrived one hour earlier – what could the time bomb do? The poor time bomb waited. I left and then they had to remove the bomb.\nDon’t be scared; there is nothing to be afraid of. The whole existence is with you.\nQuestion 5 BELOVED OSHO\nCAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SO FEW BLACK SANNYASINS? WHAT IS KEEPING THEM ESPECIALLY FROM TAKING SANNYAS?\nThe black people have been treated so badly in the past that they have become afraid of getting involved in anything outside the circle of the blacks. It is just their past that is so heavy on them; – moreover, they are poor, struggling somehow to survive. They cannot be interested in consciousness, in individuality, in the higher values of life. Their poverty prevents it; their past prevents it.\nI am against all kinds of missionaries, all kinds of conversions, so I cannot send my people there. I will wait. Slowly, slowly they will be coming, but it will take time.\nIt is not only the blacks who are missing in my people. Many people from the poor countries are missing for the simple reason that they cannot think of anything other than bread; bread is all that they can think about. They don’t have any question about the meaning of life, the meaning of existence. These are faraway questions which don’t belong to them.\nI cannot help it. Unless their poverty disappears and their fear of the past disappears, it is not very likely that many black people will become sannyasins.\nOkay, Maneesha.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7529","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/socrates_poisoned_again_after_25_centuries/part22/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/socrates_poisoned_again_after_25_centuries/>Socrates Poisoned Again After 25 Centuries</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">22 The whole existence is with you</h1><div class=post-meta>36 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7529 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Socrates_Poisoned_Again_After_25_Centuries/part22.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part21>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

CERTAINTY THAT THIS EARTH IS THE ONLY PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE LIFE
HAS BLOSSOMED, AND CONSCIOUSNESS HAS ARISEN?</p><p><br></p><p>HOW DO YOU KNOW?</p><p><br></p><p>It is not an esoteric question; it belongs to the inner science of
man. The moment one becomes enlightened, he is no longer confined in his
own body; his vision is as big as the whole universe.</p><p><br></p><p>So when I said that this earth is the only place where life has
blossomed, where not only life but consciousness has arisen, not only
that but there have been a few people who have reached to the ultimate
expression of consciousness – to me, that is godliness – I can say it
with authority because it is my own vision. But a few things have to be
added to it.</p><p><br></p><p>There are almost fifty thousand planets in the whole universe where
life has reached to the animal stage... some planets where life has only
reached to the vegetable state. But there is no planet other than earth
where there exists something similar to man – not only alive... Animals
are alive, but man is conscious of his life. To become conscious of
one’s consciousness is the highest stage, and that is not far away.</p><p>You are aware of your life.</p><p><br></p><p>You can be aware of your awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>Self-awareness will reveal you the mystery of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>You have not to accept it on my word. If you accept it, it becomes
esoteric for you. To me it is an actual experience, and there are many
experiences which I am not telling you about for the simple reason that
they will look esoteric – because you cannot conceive of them. To me
they are realities, but to you they have to become realities.</p><p><br></p><p>I mention this point especially, because I am immensely concerned
that life on the earth is not destroyed; it is existence’s most
ambitious flight.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not alive; existence is alive in you.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not conscious; existence has become conscious in you. The
moment you become conscious of consciousness, existence achieves its
fulfillment. You are so blessed in that moment that you can bless the
whole universe; that is the meaning of the word ‘Bhagwan’. It does not
mean God; it simply means the blessed one, one who is blessed and who is
capable now to share his blessing with anybody who is ready to receive
it.</p><p><br></p><p>There is nothing esoteric in it, but it belongs to the science of the
inner journey – it is not part of the objective science. So to those who
are addicted with the objective science it may look esoteric, but to
those who are not addicted to the objective... and remember that the
object cannot exist alone without your subjectivity; your subject, your
consciousness, is the polarity.</p><p><br></p><p>It is strange that logical scientists go on denying that there is
anything inner in man. They accept the outer and they deny the inner;
they accept the things in their house and they deny themselves. It is
simply ludicrous, but it cannot go on for long. More and more
intelligent people are searching inwards because the outer search has
led to death – to the ultimate death.</p><p><br></p><p>The inner search will lead you to deeper layers of life and finally
to the eternal life in the same way as the outer search leads you to
death, because objects are dead. Studying dead objects, and denying the
living subject who is studying them... Do you think one object can study
another object? – that is impossible. Do you think one stone can observe
another stone? Can it do research about the other stone?</p><p><br></p><p>To enquire into the objective world, you need an inner consciousness,
a subjectivity. That subjectivity is your consciousness. And objective
science has come to nuclear weapons, ready to destroy the whole of life
on the earth and turn it into pure objectivity without any subject. Just
the opposite happens when you reach to your innermost being: everything
becomes alive, conscious. The whole existence becomes a dancing,
singing, rejoicing universe, and your vision has no limits; you can see
things which are not possible with objective eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>I had to state this just to emphasize the fact that to destroy life
on the earth is going to be the greatest loss to existence, because
nowhere else has it evolved to the point where a Zorba can become a
Buddha. Nowhere else has it blossomed into the ultimate potential,
transforming it into an actuality.</p><p>Galileo proved that this small earth moves around the sun. It may be
a factual thing, but I say unto you that the whole universe, not only
the sun but the millions of other suns which you see as stars in the
night, and millions of solar systems are all really moving around the
earth – not factually, but in a symbolic sense because this is the only
sacred place where life exists, where consciousness exists, and where a
few people have been capable of achieving the ultimate expression of
being, enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>SOMEHOW I CAN’T BELIEVE MY LAUGHTER, IF IT’S TRUE, BUT I ALWAYS
BELIEVE IN MY TEARS. PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody does it; mankind has been accustomed to misery. Misery is
taken for granted; it is thought to be natural. Not to be miserable is
dangerous in this vast crowd of miserable people simply because they
cannot believe that someone is not miserable – something must be wrong
with him.</p><p><br></p><p>The society has penetrated deep in your mind; it is not only that
others will not believe your laughter, you yourself don’t. Your mind is
part of the society; it has created it. Your parents, teachers, priests
– they all have created your mind. A mind is something implanted in you
by the society; it belongs to the society, not to you. It is society
suspecting your laughter, making you afraid that perhaps you’ve gone
insane – because there is no reason to laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a very strange situation: when you are healthy, you don’t think
that there has to be a reason to be healthy. You don’t rush to a doctor
in panic saying, “Save me doctor, I am healthy! Do something
immediately... something has gone wrong, I am no longer sick.” Nobody
asks, “Why am I healthy?” But if you are sick you ask, “Why am I sick?”;
you go to the expert to enquire about your sickness and how to cure
it.</p><p><br></p><p>The same should be the situation about your inner world. Sadness is
sickness, and you accept it; laughter is health, and you are afraid to
accept it – you are suspicious of it. That suspicion is not yours; that
suspicion belongs to your mother, to your father, to your teachers, to
your priest, the church, and all kinds of so-called leaders.</p><p><br></p><p>If a child is not burdened with all this conditioning, when he is
laughing he will accept it naturally. When he is sad he will enquire
about why he is sad. He will go to the psychiatrist to enquire what is
the cause of his sadness, why he is so serious, why he cannot laugh, why
he cannot sing and dance.</p><p><br></p><p>A person who cannot laugh, cannot sing, cannot dance – do you think
he will be able to love? It is impossible; his love will be a sad
affair, full of tears, without any joy.</p><p><br></p><p>People are finding lovers so that they don’t feel lonely. Loneliness
hurts, but they are not aware that the other person is also lonely. And
two lonelinesses together make the problem multiplied; it does not
dissolve the problem. You were lonely; now another person is lonely. You
were sad;</p><p>now another person is sad. Now both will be carrying the sadnesses of
each other, sicknesses, seriousness, moods of despair and anguish – now
they are doubled. Before a person falls in love, he should have a right
understanding about his own state... is he capable of loving? He cannot
laugh, he cannot sing, he cannot enjoy music; he cannot enjoy
anything... how is he going to enjoy love?</p><p><br></p><p>The priests of all the religions have poisoned everything.</p><p><br></p><p>They have poisoned your love, they have poisoned your laughter. They
have poisoned your capacity to rejoice, to dance, to sing.</p><p>Just look at your churches... The moment you enter a church you
become serious – just watch it. The moment you enter a church the
climate inside you changes – you become serious. You become Christian,
which is simply a disease just like Hinduism, Buddhism... different
names of diseases.</p><p><br></p><p>Can you make love in a church? Jesus Christ hanging on the cross
looking at you... It will be a very strange scene. You cannot even
laugh. Have you seen any statue of Jesus smiling, laughing, dancing? No,
all that you know is the crucified Jesus.</p><p><br></p><p>My own understanding is that Christianity has become the biggest
religion of the world because it is a sick religion – more sick than any
other religion. The cross and a serious Jesus – naturally, on the cross
one has to be serious! It will look really odd if he starts laughing on
the cross; he has to follow etiquette. His seriousness, his death, his
cross have been helpful to millions of miserable people to join his
company: “He seems to be the right person.”</p><p><br></p><p>He has told you to carry your crosses on your own shoulders, and you
are carrying not wooden crosses, but far more deep psychological crosses
of sadness, misery, anguish, anxiety, meaninglessness. These are your
crosses. His cross was not that big, and it was something outside him;
you are carrying your crosses within your hearts. There seems to be some
kind of affinity between you and Jesus Christ.</p><p><br></p><p>The writer of ZORBA THE GREEK, Kazantzakis was expelled by the Greek
Orthodox church because he created Zorba – a man full of joy, full of
love, a man full of music, carrying no cross at all – a fiction even,
and one of the best that this century has created. And the great artist
Kazantzakis was expelled from the church because he had done something
immensely unchristian.</p><p><br></p><p>The church does not want you to be happy. Society does not want you
to be happy. The psychoanalyst does not want you to be happy. Nobody
seems to be interested in your happiness; everybody wants you to be
miserable. There must be some vested interest in your misery – there is:
the miserable man is easily enslaved. He is already broken. He has no
guts left; he cannot fight, he cannot rebel; he cannot be a
revolutionary, he has no hope. It does not matter to him; he is in such
misery, what more misery can slavery be?</p><p><br></p><p>India remained for two thousand years in slavery without a single
revolution worth calling a revolution. They call a few things... in 1942
Mahatma Gandhi called his movement a revolution. It is simply untrue.
The whole revolution died in nine days. And a country of four hundred
million people... How</p><p>many people participated in the revolution? And why did it die out in
nine days? These are not revolutions, just little efforts towards
revolution which died before they were born.</p><p><br></p><p>India was not ready for any revolution; hence, the masses remained
aloof – for them it mattered nothing. They were under the kingdom of
Hindu kings before Mohammedans came; they were miserable. Mohammedans
became emperors; they were miserable. Britishers came; they remained
miserable. Their misery does not change. Why should they bother who is
ruling them? Their hearts are so deeply sad that you cannot make them
sadder.</p><p><br></p><p>All governments want people to remain miserable, and all priests want
people to remain miserable, because only miserable people go to the
priests for consolation. Only miserable people think of paradise; only
miserable people want to be assured that blessed are the poor, blessed
are the humble because they shall inherit the kingdom of God.</p><p><br></p><p>For thousands of years misery has been imposed upon you. You are born
into it; it is part of your blood and bones. That is the reason that
when you feel laughter, to yourself you look awkward, embarrassed. But
tears are perfectly okay, because for thousands of years man has been
full of tears – his whole life is nothing but tears.</p><p><br></p><p>My people are condemned all around the earth. I am condemned for the
simple reason that I am telling you to throw the crosses off your
shoulders. If you are so much attached to carrying something, carry a
guitar – but a cross is not something to be carried.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been teaching my people to be happy, rejoicing, loving,
because those are natural things which have been repressed. But strange
people have the majority under them. I have told my people to drop all
old conceptions. For example, you have been told for centuries that love
is unspiritual. Love to God is perfectly okay – that is spiritual love
because there is no God, so you can go on praying and be very loving to
God who does not exist. But love to a woman or a man is dangerous
because the woman is real, the man is real.</p><p><br></p><p>They have tried to divert your love to a nonexistential thing so you
cannot love those who are real. And they have made it clear to you that
these two loves are opposite to each other: either you can love a woman
or you can love God... strange! I can’t think why there should be such a
competition between God and a woman. Is God a woman?... so jealous?</p><p><br></p><p>Why has a man to renounce life and its joys to attain the same
pleasures in heaven? What kind of logic is this? Here everything is sin,
and the same things in heaven become rewards, to the same saints who
were told not even to look at a woman.</p><p><br></p><p>In India there was a saint, Surdas, who took his eyes out. His name,
Surdas has become equivalent to blind man, because to call a blind man
“blind man” looks a little inhuman. In India a blind man is called
surdas – the name of a great saint. It simply means a blind man, but
looks more sophisticated and does not hurt the blind man. Surdas took
out his eyes because he was afraid that if the eyes are there and women
are all around... and there are things which are beyond your control.
Sometimes you see a face and you like it, you love it. It happens in
such a split second that you cannot remember in that second that you are
a religious man, you have renounced the world. It is better to get rid
of the eyes so you will not see who is man, who is woman, who is
beautiful. And this is not an exception.</p><p>In the Soviet Union before the revolution, there were thousands of
men and women – a very fanatic Christian cult which demanded that you
cut your genitals. And people were cutting their genitals to assure the
church absolutely about their chastity, celibacy. The poor woman was
again at a loss what to cut... the man was going far higher in spiritual
growth. Then finally they started cutting their breasts. There were
thousands of women who had cut their breasts and they were thought to be
very religious. Men who had cut their genitals were thought more
religious – they were saints.</p><p><br></p><p>All these religions have been poisoning your naturality. My effort is
to throw any unnatural conditioning off you, and introduce you again to
your innocence, to your nature.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day my secretary Anando reported to me that there are
reports in the newspapers that there are sexual orgies here. I said,
“But I am here, and you don’t invite me either. Great things are
happening and I am present, and I have to come to know about great
things through newspapers. This is not right.”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “But no orgies are happening. These are all false
reports.”</p><p><br></p><p>I looked into the report and I found what the reason was. It must
have come from the hotels and places where my people are staying. No
orgies are happening anywhere, but this is part of my teaching: whatever
you do, do totally. So when my people are making love, they really love.
They groan, they moan, they scream, they dance, they sing. And, you
know, the hotel walls are not very thick, so all the neighbors are
keeping their ears to what is happening... It must be an orgy! Two
persons making so much noise... not possible!</p><p><br></p><p>They also make love, but they make love according to the tradition
that the woman should not move. And to prevent her movement the man is
on top of the woman. Now this is beast over the beauty – he’s muscular,
he’s bigger, and the poor delicate woman is simply crushed under him.
What kind of love...? And he is in a hurry to finish it soon because it
is a sin – the sooner finished the better! You should not rejoice in it,
you should not prolong it, and your neighbors should not know. So the
woman remains quiet, silent, almost a corpse. That is the definition of
a lady.</p><p><br></p><p>A lady is not a woman. A lady is a dead woman; a lady simply means a
good lay, she simply lies down and remains with closed eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>And do you know why women close their eyes when you make love? – just
to avoid seeing you. You are doing such a nasty thing to them, they
don’t want to see; they don’t want the light on. The man is finished
within seconds, because only he is making movements.</p><p><br></p><p>Neither the man attains orgasm nor the woman attains orgasm. Orgasm
needs a little more articulateness, a little more skill. Orgasm needs
first a long foreplay – unless sex is accepted as natural, it is not
possible – a foreplay with incense burning, a music record going on,
Irene Pappas singing! And before you start making love – love should not
be an immediate thing – you should dance, you should sing, you should
prepare your bodies to rejoice, you should prepare your bodies for the
thrill. And waiting is a thrill.</p><p><br></p><p>You should make love only when it happens naturally, listening to
music, dancing, the beautiful fragrance of incense, flowers... Your love
chamber should be a temple. I cannot use the word ‘church’; it is too
ugly. That’s why I am using the word ‘temple’.</p><p>And when your energies are flowing, moving, enjoying and your whole
bodies are ready – not just your minds which want to make love... The
woman certainly needs her whole body to be ready because her whole body
is orgasmic.</p><p><br></p><p>Man’s sexuality is local, genital; woman’s sexuality is all over her
body. So by dancing and singing, her whole body will be throbbing, will
be getting ready, will be getting warmer. The lady will be disappearing
and the woman will be coming back.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course the lady should be on top, never the man on top. That is
inhuman. And that is purely according to sexual science, that the man
should be under the woman because then he cannot move much, and if he
cannot move much then his ejaculation will not be within three seconds,
it will take time. Let the woman move. And when you are in joy, you
shout, you scream, you moan, you groan, and you don’t care about the
neighbors. Then only it is possible for both to come to an orgasm.</p><p><br></p><p>Orgasm is a gift of nature that leads you to religiousness, because
through orgasm you come to know a unity with existence. For a moment you
disappear, time stops, mind functions no more... all is silent and all
is beautiful; but it is only for moments. But once you have tasted it,
you would like it to remain with you twenty-four hours.</p><p><br></p><p>The first man who must have discovered meditation... I am absolutely
certain that the discovery was made through orgasm, because there is no
other way to discover meditation. In orgasm all those basic elements are
present which make meditation. And some adventurer, enquirer, must have
thought, “Why am I feeling so euphoric, so ecstatic?” And he must have
noted these three points: I disappear – a certain am-ness remains, a
certain is-ness remains, but there is no I. Time disappears – there is
no past, no future, just the moment, the present. Mind disappears – no
thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>Anybody with a little intelligence could have figured out that if
these three things can be managed without making love then the same
experience will happen. This is the origin of meditation. Nobody knows
how many thousand years ago some unknown explorer – the greatest
explorer in the world – found it out, but it worked. Because with love
you are always dependent on the other person, and for two persons there
is a certain kind of dependence on each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation manages to make you egoless, to bring you to the present
moment, and to stop the thought process – and you have a far bigger
orgasm without any sex involved in it. Once you have the key in your
hands you can remain twenty-four hours in your inner being in the same
bliss, in the same benediction.</p><p><br></p><p>So my teachings look very contradictory to people – they are not. I
teach you to make love as totally as possible so that you can transcend
it, so that you can find by yourself what is making love such a joyful
event – but it is only for moments. Those three ingredients which
constitute orgasm you can try separately, and that’s how I have managed
meditation. Those three ingredients you can attain. And once you can
have an orgasmic experience alone, you are free from women, you are free
from men, you are directly in contact with existence – there is no
mediator. Only such a person can go beyond sex.</p><p><br></p><p>Going beyond sex does not mean that sex was sin. In fact, sex was the
cause of all the spirituality</p><p>that arose out of it. So even the man who has gone beyond sex can
enjoy sex just for fun, once in a while. Sex is not against
spirituality.</p><p><br></p><p>When you have experienced orgasm in sex, don’t forget the afterplay.
Just as there is foreplay which brings you to a thrilling readiness,
after orgasm, if you turn your side and you say, “Now I am feeling
sleepy,” this is insulting. You don’t understand the woman; your sex is
only genital. Once you have ejaculated you start feeling sleepy because
you have lost energy, you have become dull. Sleep will rejuvenate you so
the natural cycle seems to be falling into sleep. But the woman’s whole
body was involved – she is still throbbing.</p><p><br></p><p>Modern sexology has come to understand that a woman is capable of
multiple orgasms – one after another, at least six orgasms – and you
have given her only one orgasm. She is still ready for five orgasms, and
this is an ordinary situation: the husband goes to sleep, and the wife
cries and weeps.</p><p><br></p><p>If the husband is more considerate – and he should be more
considerate to a woman who has given him such a beautiful experience...
He should be considerate: afterplay, a little more music, a little more
song, a little more playfulness, or just lying down together. She will
cool down; she will again become a lady. Unless she becomes a lady, you
are not supposed to go to sleep; when she becomes a lady you can say
goodbye and go to sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>So I know from where those reports are coming. My people are staying
in hotels and they must be making a racket. And I don’t want you to
prevent your rackets – it is your private affair; it is your private
room. You are paying for it. Now what you do in the room is your
business; it is not the business of the bishop.</p><p><br></p><p>Basically, my insistence is on totality. Whatever you do be total in
it, be natural in it, and soon you will discover that laughter and joy
are natural. Sometimes you may like just to dance for no reason, just
because you are so full of energy and the energy wants to dance. Then
don’t prevent it, don’t repress it, because every repressed energy
becomes poisonous.</p><p><br></p><p>Express it, and don’t be worried about the world. Take one thing for
granted: since you have been with me, the world knows you are crazy. Now
there is no problem. They know you are crazy; you need not be worried
about them. You be crazily in love with life, nature, so that you can
transcend both life and nature. And there is a transcendence waiting for
you, but it is only for those who live totally.</p><p><br></p><p>Then tears may also come, but they will not be of sadness; they will
be of joy, they will be of gratitude, they will be of sheer
blissfulness.</p><p><br></p><p>Tears are a language of anything overflowing.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are so full of sadness then your tears are of sadness. If you
are so full of joy the tears will be of joy.</p><p>I am not saying prevent the tears; they have their own beauty.</p><p>But they should be of joy, they should be of love, they should come
out of your silence, out of your peace, out of your heart in tremendous
gratitude that existence has given you life, has given you
consciousness, and has given you a crazy friend like me.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHAT IS THE ESSENCE OF PATIENCE?</p><p><br></p><p>Patience has been exploited by people.</p><p><br></p><p>There has been poverty for centuries and people have been told just
to be patient, “It is a test of your trust in God.” They have been told
just to be patient, “It is only a question of a few years and then you
will be entering into paradise.”</p><p><br></p><p>Patience has been used as part of an exploitation of people in every
field, but patience itself is a beautiful quality.</p><p><br></p><p>You should not allow your patience to be exploited.</p><p><br></p><p>But to be patient, to me means trust – trust in nature, trust in
existence, trust in yourself. Things are going to be better every day;
whatever happens, your patience finds in it something better for you. It
is a very great alchemy; it changes suffering into blessing. It is a
great instrument in your hands, you just have to understand that the
instrument has to be used by you, not by others on you.</p><p><br></p><p>There are continuous changes in life – life is a flux. Heraclitus
says, “You cannot step twice in the same river.”</p><p>I say to you, “You cannot even step once in the same river.”</p><p><br></p><p>The river is continuously moving... There are ups, there are downs,
there are days and there are nights.</p><p><br></p><p>Patience consists of seeing things in a way that everything becomes a
joy to you. For example, you can see that every day has been sandwiched
between two dark nights. That will give you good misery and sadness –
what a life it is... just a small day and two big, dark nights.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of understanding will see that every night is so small between
two beautiful sunny days. Life is the same – your outlook changes. There
are people who will not look at the roseflower, they will look at the
thorns. They will be in deep despair that existence cannot even produce
roses without thorns, but they are paying more attention to thorns than
to roses.</p><p><br></p><p>A man of understanding will love the rose, and will take the thorn as
a protection for the rose. It is a protection; the same rosebush is
supplying juice to both – to the rose and to the thorn. The thorn must
have some natural function. Its function is to protect the rose – it is
a soldier, a guard.</p><p>Once you see life just from a different angle, your heart starts
throbbing in a different way. Everything can be looked at with negative
eyes, and there are people who will think about everything with negative
eyes; they may become good critics, but they will be utter failures in
life. There is a way to see life with positive eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>I was visiting a palace in Jaipur in India. Jaipur is one of the most
beautiful cities in the world. The man who was creating it, Maharaja Jai
Singh, wanted to defeat Paris, but he died before he could complete the
project. So Jaipur has remained incomplete, but it has tremendous
beauty. No city in India has that quality.</p><p><br></p><p>I was visiting his palace. His grandson, who is now in the place of
the grandfather, said to me, “Please, don’t take note if you see
something incomplete in the palace.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “What is the matter?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “My grandfather had a certain idea that nothing should be
made complete, that then it has a certain kind of deadness; something
should remain incomplete... possibilities for growth. And by coincidence
he could not complete Jaipur. He died. And this was his whole life’s
philosophy; he never made anything complete. Something will be missing
in it, and the people who come with negative eyes immediately see the
missing thing. The whole palace is so beautiful, but their whole concern
becomes concentrated on a small stone that is missing, and they become
frustrated.” Perhaps Maharaja Jai Singh had some understanding of
life.</p><p><br></p><p>In life nothing is perfect, everything has some imperfection.</p><p><br></p><p>Imperfection means life is still growing, evolution is still
happening. The day everything is complete will be the worst day in
existence, because that day everything will become dead. There will be
no growth, no need for evolution; everything will be stuck. Don’t look
to the imperfections; look at so much beauty that surrounds small
imperfections.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a change of perspective that brings patience to you. Then you
know that everything is good, and everything is going to be better
because it has been going on for centuries becoming better and better.
There is no need to be worried about tomorrow; tomorrow is going to be
better.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole existence is involved in bettering itself.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to be just a little patient, you should not be in a hurry.
You should not ask that everything should be given to you right now.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything comes in its own time. Everything comes when you are
ripe.</p><p>Everything comes when you deserve it – this is my experience.</p><p><br></p><p>In the last thirty years I have not felt, even for a single moment,
any impatience, and I have seen that everything goes on becoming better.
Existence itself is involved; we are part of it – there is no</p><p>need to worry. Even something that looks dark today may prove just
the beginning of a new dawn. Before the dawn the night is the
darkest.</p><p><br></p><p>Just watch life.</p><p><br></p><p>Try to understand life and patience will come to you on its own
accord.</p><p><br></p><p>I was in jail in America. In the first jail the sheriff of the jail
asked me, “Perhaps you would never have thought that you would be in a
jail.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I keep my future open. I can be anywhere... even in hell I
will not be disturbed.”</p><p><br></p><p>He took me to my cell. He said, “It is unjust. You have been arrested
without any warrant, without even giving you any calls – you have not
been allowed to inform your attorneys. This is simply unjust. In my
whole life I have never seen something like this happening.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “This is a good experience for you. Things like this can
happen. To me it makes no difference whether the arrest warrant was
there or not, I would have been here anyway. And these days I will be in
the jail are going to give me a new experience and a new perspective of
life which I would have missed.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You seem to be a little bit of a strange type.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am. This is only the beginning. We will come to know each
other more.”</p><p><br></p><p>And just within two days he became so friendly to me that he was
worried that soon I would be freed, and “We will miss you forever.”
Because in those two days, thousands of telegrams, telephone calls and
telexes and flowers came from all over the world, he said, “I have never
seen such a thing. In my jail there have been cabinet ministers,
secretaries, great politicians. Nobody cares about them but you seem to
be really influential all over the world. Now my wife wants to see you,
my children want your autograph, and if you don’t mind, I also want your
autograph to show to people that you have been in my jail. I am proud
that we had the chance to take care of you for two days.”</p><p><br></p><p>He really took good care. He put me in the hospital ward and when I
left, even I started thinking, “Should I leave or not?” because all the
nurses were crying. I said, “My God, this is difficult.”</p><p><br></p><p>Six nurses weeping and saying, “We will miss you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I can understand. I can stay here forever – for me there is
no problem – but they won’t let me stay. And you should understand, you
are only six; I have left five thousand people in my commune, and one
million people around the world who must be crying and weeping. But
looking at your faces, it feels like I should forget the world and
remain here. I had never thought that jail can be such a beautiful
place.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “It never was. It is you who changed it. When so many
telegrams and so many telephone calls started coming we realized we had
to clean everything because everybody was concerned about your allergy.
We had not cleaned for years.”</p><p>The whole jail was full of flowers. They had no space to put flowers.
They started asking me, “What to do? Now flowers go on coming and we
don’t have place, and the whole jail looks like a flower shop.”</p><p><br></p><p>Even the old man who had received me into the jail, the head of the
jail, had tears in his eyes when he let me out.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “We will remember you – in just two days you changed our
whole jail. Our inmates have never been so happy. We have five hundred
inmates. They all know you because they all see you on television every
day, and they are happy that they had a chance to live with you for two
days in the same jail. Now it is no longer a jail for them. It has
become a pride for them.”</p><p><br></p><p>After twelve days being in five jails, when I came out the last U.S.
marshal who took me out of the jail said, “This is strange, you are
looking better than you looked when we took you to the jail.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That is your fault. What can I do about it? I enjoyed the
whole thing. It was such a new experience, and my doctor will be very
happy that I have lost eight pounds. Having nothing to do, I was
continually walking in the corridors. Not getting my food... I was just
taking juice or fruits so it has been tremendously good for my health.
And whenever I gain weight again I will inform you and you can arrest
me. There is no need of any warrant. There was no warrant this time;
next time there is no need for any warrant. And twelve days are not
enough! – keep me at least for fifteen days.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “But nobody likes jail.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Who is bothering about the jail? – I like everything. I find
something beautiful in it. Sitting in my cell twenty-four hours after
thirty years of continually talking to people – this was a great
holiday. The nurses were beautiful; they were taking every care, and the
inmates were very beautiful. You think them criminals – your bureaucrats
are more criminal, more inhuman than the inmates. Wherever I arrived
they welcomed me behind the bars showing me the victory sign saying,
‘Osho, don’t be worried, you will be victorious because they are doing
absolutely criminal and wrong things. We have been watching you on the
television; we are all with you.’”</p><p><br></p><p>Those twelve days are a beautiful memory to me; otherwise the very
name ‘jail’ looks bad – it all depends on how you look at things. In the
first jail, the jailer became so interested in me and so angry about the
injustice that was being done to me, that he allowed a world press
conference inside the jail.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “But it may harm you.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I don’t care. I have got only two years before being
retired; at the most they can retire me now.”</p><p><br></p><p>I asked, “But has there ever been a press conference inside the jail
for a prisoner?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Never, but we will make history.” He invited all the press
and we had a beautiful press conference inside the jail.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole of America was shocked.</p><p>The government was shocked: “What is the point of keeping this man in
jail? He has gained more sympathy from people, and even from jail he is
still available to people on television. Millions of people are seeing
him who would have never thought about him.”</p><p><br></p><p>They regretted that they had committed a mistake, and I enjoyed that
they committed a mistake. They destroyed the commune. They are
fools...</p><p>They think a commune consists of houses and roads; they don’t
understand anything higher than matter.</p><p><br></p><p>My commune consists of people.</p><p><br></p><p>My commune consists of people’s love.</p><p><br></p><p>They cannot destroy it; they have increased it. The number of
sannyasins has increased all over the world. And every day it is
increasing, for the simple reason that people have become aware that the
governments are afraid of me. That means I have some message which can
change the whole of society.</p><p><br></p><p>Just be patient and be understanding. Everything always goes on going
better and better – that is my experience. Whatever happens, ultimately
things turn out even better.</p><p><br></p><p>Now my commune has spread all over the world. The whole credit goes
to the fascist government of America.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I’M A SANNYASIN. WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THEM AND ME, I SAY THAT I AM FINISHED WITH MISERY. BUT OSHO, I AM STILL
SCARED.</p><p><br></p><p>I can understand your problem. To be finished with misery is going to
create troubles for you in a miserable society; that’s what scares you.
You become a stranger, an outsider, but don’t be worried. Miserable
people can do no harm to you; they are so engrossed in their misery,
they cannot do any harm to you.</p><p><br></p><p>The bishop here in St. Nicholas has been threatening for three weeks
that he is going to take a protest march in the city against me. But
every time he changes the date. The difficulty is that only a few old
women come to this congregation. Now, taking those few old women for a
protest march, he will just look like a buffoon. He calls those old
ladies “the concerned citizens of St. Nicholas”!</p><p><br></p><p>My people are moving into the town and nobody is against them. The
young people... Because that bishop started finding that the protest
seems to be difficult, he started a signature campaign. Naturally, that
is easier. If the bishop goes to somebody, just to get rid of him they
will sign. But a few young men, seeing that the bishop is gathering
signatures against me, have started a campaign</p><p>of collecting signatures for me. Those young men don’t know me, and I
don’t know them, but they want me here.</p><p><br></p><p>The bishop phoned the owner of this house, a famous film director,
saying, “We will burn the house, and you will never be forgiven by God
for becoming the host to a very dangerous man.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the director told him, “You can burn the house because it is old
and I am no longer interested in it. But before you bother about me
being forgiven or not forgiven by God, you should look just above your
head: Katzantzakis’ soul has not forgiven your rotten church. First get
forgiveness from Katzantzakis and then think about other people.”</p><p><br></p><p>But strange things the bishop was asking the director, “Do you think
Osho is a messiah?” Perhaps deep down he is also afraid – who knows?</p><p><br></p><p>The director said, “I do not know, but one thing is certain, that I
am always for those who are stoned and I am against those who stone
them.”</p><p><br></p><p>This bishop has no power. He has not even the guts to come here. He
is deep down afraid, “Perhaps this man may be a messiah – who knows?”
Jesus was not recognized by the Jews as a messiah and they crucified
him. Perhaps the people of St. Nicholas don’t know that a messiah has
come, and they may be unnecessarily creating a protest march... And this
and that...</p><p><br></p><p>Who cares about their protest march? And if he wants to burn the
house, I will be in the house and he can come and burn the house. There
has been one criminal act by Greece, that against Socrates; now there
will be a second criminal charge against Greece. He cannot even come
close to here; how is he going to burn the house... with the help of
those old ladies? Great revolutionaries he has collected!</p><p><br></p><p>You need not be scared. You remain in your blissfulness. What you are
saying to people is absolutely right, misery is the difference.</p><p><br></p><p>There are one million sannyasins. Not a single sannyasin has yet been
killed by anybody. I received threats every day for thirty years that
they are going to kill me. They have even tried three times, made
attempts to kill me and failed. What can I do about it? Those are
idiots. They should come first and ask me, “How to kill you?” Just as I
answer everybody else, I will answer them too and show them the right
way, because I don’t want that they should be caught and they should be
punished after they have killed me. So I can manage everything for
them!</p><p><br></p><p>Three times they have tried and failed – twice in India and once in
America. Even the American government failed. They had planted a bomb in
the jail, underneath the chair where I was sitting. They should have
asked me, “At what time are you coming? – because we have to fix the
time bomb at the exact time.” I would have told them; they did not ask
me. I arrived one hour earlier – what could the time bomb do? The poor
time bomb waited. I left and then they had to remove the bomb.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be scared; there is nothing to be afraid of. The whole
existence is with you.</p><p>Question 5 BELOVED OSHO</p><p>CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SO FEW BLACK
SANNYASINS? WHAT IS KEEPING THEM ESPECIALLY FROM TAKING SANNYAS?</p><p><br></p><p>The black people have been treated so badly in the past that they
have become afraid of getting involved in anything outside the circle of
the blacks. It is just their past that is so heavy on them; – moreover,
they are poor, struggling somehow to survive. They cannot be interested
in consciousness, in individuality, in the higher values of life. Their
poverty prevents it; their past prevents it.</p><p><br></p><p>I am against all kinds of missionaries, all kinds of conversions, so
I cannot send my people there. I will wait. Slowly, slowly they will be
coming, but it will take time.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not only the blacks who are missing in my people. Many people
from the poor countries are missing for the simple reason that they
cannot think of anything other than bread; bread is all that they can
think about. They don’t have any question about the meaning of life, the
meaning of existence. These are faraway questions which don’t belong to
them.</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot help it. Unless their poverty disappears and their fear of
the past disappears, it is not very likely that many black people will

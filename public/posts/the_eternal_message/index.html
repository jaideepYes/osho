collection of thirty immortal letters written by Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh
to Ma Yoga Bhakti, New York, U.S.A., now Ma Ananda Pratima, World
President of Neo-Sannyas International</h4><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. <strong>Materialistic societies produce hollow
men.</strong></p><p>Men with dead emptiness within.</p><p>And because of this dead emptiness one dies before one is really
born.</p><p>Remember that man cannot live by SHOPS alone. And today the holy of
holies is the SHOP.</p><h4 style=padding-left:33pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-outer-is-meaningless-without-the-inner-richness.-and-the-outer-richness-only-makes-the-inner-poverty-prominent>The
outer is meaningless without the inner richness. <span class=p>And the
outer richness only makes the inner poverty prominent</span></h4><p>Man is hollow because there is no inner growth.</p><p>And the inner grows only when one lives in the inner Inward is the
way of growth, grace and God.</p><p><br></p><p>20-4-1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. Life is non-fragmentary.</p><p>But mind makes it appear fragmentary.</p><p>And this fragmentation creates all the problems. Beware of
fragmentation.</p><p>And always look beyond them. And belove them.</p><p>And through them.</p><p>Then you will be able to see the ocean in spite of all the waves.</p><p>The waves are in the ocean.</p><p>But the waves are not the ocean. The ocean can be without the
waves</p><p>But the waves cannot be without the ocean</p><p><br></p><p>21-5-1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. A small boy with a penny tightly clutched in his hot little
hand entered the toy-shop and drove the proprietor to distraction,
asking him to show this and that and everything without ever making up
his mind.</p><p>"Look here my boy," said the storekeeper finally, "What do you want
to buy for a penny - the whole world with a fence around it?"</p><p>The boy thought for a moment and then replied "Let us see it."</p><p><br></p><p>And I say to you that ordinarily no one is different from that small
boy in this world.</p><p>But unless one is different, one is not mature. And <strong>maturity
does not come with age alone.</strong></p><p>Maturity comes through understanding the distinction between that
which is possible and that which is not possible.</p><p><br></p><p>17-4-1971.</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti, Love. Reason is not enough.</p><p>It is necessary but not enough. The Beyond must be remembered. And
always.</p><p>Because reason in itself is destructive. Alone it is nothing but a
cutting weapon. It creates man, anti-all, and pro-nothing.</p><p>It creates absolutely <strong>negative minds, which can criticize,
but cannot create.</strong></p><p>Because reason has no healing force within itself.</p><p>It is only a tiny part and not the WHOLE of life <strong>and the
healing force is always with the WHOLE.</strong></p><p>22-4-1971</p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. Now man knows more about man than ever. And yet no problem is
solved.</p><h4 style=padding-left:33pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=it-seems-that-something-is-basically-wrong-with-our-so--called-knowledge-itself.>It
seems that something is basically wrong with our so- called knowledge
itself.</h4><p>This whole knowledge is derived from analysis.</p><p>And analysis is incapable of penetrating into the depths of
consciousness.</p><p>The Analytical method is all right with matter or with things.</p><p>Because there is no INSIDE to them. But <strong>consciousness is
INSIDENESS.</strong></p><p>And to use the analytical method with consciousness is to treat it as
an object, while it is not an object at all.</p><p>And it cannot be made an object. Its very nature is subjectivity.</p><p>Its being is subjectivity.</p><p>So it must not be approached from outside.</p><p>Because then whatsoever is known about it is not about it.
Consciousness must be approached from inside.</p><p>And then the method is meditation and not analysis. Meditation is
synthetic.</p><p>It is concerned with the whole and not with the part. It is
subjective and not objective.</p><p>It is irrational or super-rational and not rational. It is religious
or mystic, and not scientific.</p><h4 style=padding-left:33pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=authentic-knowledge-of-consciousness-comes-only-through-meditation-and-all-else-is-just-superficial-acquaintance-and-basically-erroneous-because-the-very-source-of-it-is-fallacious.>Authentic
knowledge of consciousness comes only through meditation <span class=p>and all else is just superficial acquaintance and basically
erroneous because the very source of it is fallacious.</span></h4><p>And poisonous.</p><p>24-4-1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. Man is strange - very strange.</p><p>Because, he begins by deceiving others and ends with de- ceiving
himself.</p><p><br></p><p>A Fakir was walking down the village street deep in thought, when
some urchins began to throw stones at him. He was taken by surprise and
besides he was not a big man. "Don't do that and I will tell you
something of interest to you."</p><p>"All right, what is it? But no philosophy."</p><p>"The King is giving a free banquet to all comers." He just simply
lied to them.</p><p>The children ran off toward the king's palace as the Fakir warmed to
his theme, the delicacies and the delights of the entertainment ……</p><p>He looked up and saw them disappearing in the distance. And then,
suddenly he tucked up his robes and started to sprint after them.</p><p>"I would better go and see," he panted to himself, because it</p><p>MIGHT be true after all.”</p><p><br></p><p>30-4-1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. Look at yourself without thinking, evaluating or judging.</p><p>Without any liking or disliking.</p><p>That is, without any movement of the mind. Or, without the noise of
the mind.</p><p>Then you have eyes which are altogether different from your eyes.</p><p>Because they are not burdened by the past. They are innocent.</p><p>And silent.</p><p>And <strong>in this silence there is neither the observer, nor the
observed.</strong></p><p>But That-Which-Is. Undivided and one. Beginningless and endless.</p><p>You can call it God or Nirvana or anything whatsoever. The name does
not matter.</p><p>Because the name is not the thing.</p><p>And when one has known the thing, one does not bother about the
name.</p><p>1-5-1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p>Love. With thought the mind has boundaries.</p><p>But <strong>without thought the mind is just infinite
space.</strong></p><p>That is why in thoughtless awareness one stops to be a drop and
becomes oceanic.</p><p>And then there is great energy.</p><p>This energy wipes out everything which is dead.</p><h4 style=padding-left:33pt;text-indent:0;line-height:14pt;text-align:left id=it-wipes-out-the-whole-karmic-past.>It wipes out the whole Karmic
past.</h4><p>And, with no effort at all.</p><p>The greater absorbs the lesser and remains untouched.</p><p><br></p><p>2-5-1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. The purest ore is produced from the hottest furnace. And, the
brook would lose its song if we removed the rocks.</p><p><br></p><p>28-4-1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. Oh! Just drop yourself into the Divine and be purified.
Surrender and be reborn.</p><p>Do not resist. Let Go!</p><p><br></p><p>3-5-1971.</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. The attitude is everything.</p><h4 style=padding-left:33pt;text-indent:0;line-height:14pt;text-align:left id=negative-attitudes-negate-life.>Negative attitudes negate
Life.</h4><p>They are good to die, but not good to live. Life needs positive
attitudes.</p><p>Life feeds on them.</p><p>Because they not only make you happy but creative also.</p><p>Once there lived an old woman, but the older she became, the younger
she felt.</p><p>Because <strong>youthfulness has nothing to do with age.</strong></p><p>It is an attitude.</p><p>And with age and its richness one can really be younger than the
young.</p><p>The old woman was so cheerful and creative that everyone wondered at
her.</p><p>“But you must have some clouds in your life,” said a visitor.
"Clouds?" she replied, "Why of course; if there were no clouds where
would the blessed showers come from?"</p><p>In the presence of trouble, and there are troubles in life, the
positive mind grows wings, but others buy crutches.</p><p>Grow wings and do not buy crutches.</p><p><br></p><p>13-5-1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. <strong>Meditation is like the sea, receiving the dirty river
and yet remaining pure.</strong></p><p>You need not be purified before it. But you will come purified out of
it. Meditation is unconditional.</p><p>Purity is not a pre-requirement - but a consequence.</p><p>4-5-1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. When I say mutation, I do not mean simply change. Change is
from the known to the known.</p><p>A sinner becomes a saint; then it is change and not mutation.
<strong>You can practice change - but you cannot practice
mutation.</strong></p><p>Because only the known can be practiced.</p><p>And then any change is going to be only a modified past. Because the
past will be continuous in it.</p><p>And the past also will be the master of it. Because it is cultivated
by the past.</p><p>In other words, change is from This to That. It is a movement in the
known.</p><p>But <strong>mutation is explosion.</strong></p><p>From this to nothingness. From here to nowhere.</p><p>You cannot practice it.</p><p>On the contrary, <strong>you are the only hindrance.</strong></p><p>So what is to be done? Really nothing can be done.</p><p>Be aware of this helplessness. And, <strong>remain</strong> in this
helplessness. Do not do anything.</p><p>Because any doing will be escaping from this fact of
helplessness.</p><h4 style=padding-left:33pt;text-indent:0;line-height:14pt;text-align:left id=do-not-move-at-all.>Do not move at all.</h4><p>And then there is explosion. And then there is mutation.</p><p>11–5–1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. Total acceptance of existence is impossible for the mind.</p><p>Because <strong>the mind exists as denial.</strong></p><p>It exists with the NO.</p><p>And with a total YES it dies</p><p>So it continues to find reasons to say NO - even if there are no
reasons.</p><p>Walking with a disciple one day, Mulla Nasrudin saw for the first
time in his life a beautiful Lakeland scene. "What a delight!" he
exclaimed. "But if only, if only..." "If only what, Master?" asked the
disciple.</p><p>"If only they had not put water into it!”</p><p><br></p><p>17-5-1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. Thought is divisive It divides ad infinitum.</p><p>So thought can never come to the total - to the WHOLE. And, the whole
is.</p><p>While the parts are not - or they are only for the mind. And if there
is no mind then there are no parts.</p><p>With the mind and because of the mind the ONE becomes many - or
appears so.</p><p>And <strong>with the mind, and through the mind, to conceive the One
is impossible.</strong></p><p>Of course, it can think about the One, but that one is nothing but
putting together all the parts.</p><p>And that one is quite different from the ONE which is. The one which
is conceptualized by the mind is just a mathematical construct.</p><p>It is not a living whole It is not organic.</p><h4 style=padding-left:33pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=and-unless-one-experiences-the-cosmos-as-an-organic-whole-one-has-not-known-anything-at-all.>And
unless one experiences the Cosmos as an organic Whole one has not known
anything at all.</h4><p>This is not possible with thought.</p><p>But this is possible with NO-THOUGHT</p><p>13-5-1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. <strong>No ideology can help to create a new
world.</strong></p><p>Cr. a new mind.</p><p>Cr. a new human being.</p><p>Because, ideological orientation itself is the root cause of all the
conflicts and all the miseries.</p><p>Thought creates boundaries. Thought creates divisions.</p><p>And thought creates prejudices.</p><p>And thought itself cannot bridge them. That is why all ideologies
fail.</p><p>Now man must learn to live without ideologies. Religious, political
or otherwise.</p><h4 style=padding-left:33pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=when-the-mind-is-not-tethered-to-any-ideology-it-is-free-to-move-to-new-understandings.>When
the mind is not tethered to any ideology, it is free to move to new
understandings.</h4><p>And in that freedom flowers all that is good. And all that is
beautiful.</p><p>14-5-1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. Search and the ego is always somewhere behind.</p><h4 style=padding-left:33pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=search-and-in-every-act-the-ego-is-the-motivation.-but-if-one-can-find-it-so---and-can-realize-it-so---one-goes-beyond-it.>Search
and in every act the ego is the motivation. <span class=p>But if one
can find it so - and can realize it so - one goes beyond it.</span></h4><p>Because the very realization is the going beyond.</p><p><br></p><p>"Brother," said Mulla Nasrudin to a neighbour, "I am collecting to
pay the debt of a poor man who cannot meet his obligations."</p><p>"Very laudable," said the other and gave him a coin.</p><p>“Who is this person?"</p><p>"Me," said Nasrudin as he hurried away.</p><p>A few weeks later he was at the door again.</p><p>"I suppose you are calling about a debt," said the non- cynical
neighbour.</p><p>"I am."</p><p>"I suppose someone can't pay a debt, and you want a
contribution?"</p><p>"That is so.”</p><p>"I suppose it is <strong>you</strong> who owe the money?" "Not this
time."</p><p>"Well, I am glad to hear it. Take this contribution." Nasrudin
pocketed the money.</p><p>"Just one thing, Mulla. What prompts your humanitarian sentiments in
this particular case?"</p><p>"Ah, you see I am the creditor!"</p><p><br></p><p>26-5-1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. Knowledge is accumulation. That is why knowledge is always
dead. While <strong>learning is moment to moment.</strong></p><p>Because learning is not accumulation - but movement.</p><h4 style=padding-left:33pt;text-indent:0;line-height:14pt;text-align:left id=so-do-not-be-dead-with-knowledge.>So do not be dead with
knowledge.</h4><p>But move with learning. Only then you will be alive.</p><p>Do not be tethered to experience Experience is slavery.</p><h4 style=padding-left:33pt;text-indent:0;line-height:14pt;text-align:left id=always-transcend-that-which-has-been.>Always transcend that which
has been.</h4><p>So that you are ready to receive the new.</p><p>Ecstasy is always with the new, with the fresh, with the young, with
the discontinuous.</p><p>And to be always in the discontinuous is to be in the Divine.</p><p>15-5-1971</p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. <strong>Truth is never second-hand.</strong></p><p>It can not be transferred.</p><p>One has to know it and be it oneself. That is why all tradition
falsifies it. And all scriptures.</p><p>And all words.</p><p>And in the end it is nothing but the soup of Mulla Nasrudin. But
first I must tell you the story.</p><p>A kinsman came to see Nasrudin from the country and brought a duck.
Nasrudin was grateful, had the bird cooked and shared it with the
guest.</p><p>Presently another visitor arrived. "I am a friend," he said, “of the
man who gave you the duck." Nasrudin fed him as well.</p><p>This happened several times. Nasrudin’s house had become like a
restaurant for out-of-town visitors. Everyone was a friend at some
removes, of the original donor of the duck, Finally Nasrudin was
exasperated. One day there was a knock at the door and a stranger
appeared. "I am the friend of the friend of the friend of the man who
brought you the duck from the country," he said.</p><p>"Come in," said Nasrudin.</p><p>They seated themselves at the table and Nasrudin asked his wife to
bring the soup.</p><p>When the guest tasted it, it seemed to be nothing more than warm
water. "What sort of soup is this?" he asked the Mulla.</p><p>"That," said Nasrudin, "is the soup of the soup of the soup of the
soup of the duck.</p><p>21-5-1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. <strong>Religion is living without conflict.</strong></p><p>That is - without ideas, And, without ideals.</p><p>Because, whenever one lives with ideals, there is conflict. There is
conflict between that which is and that which should be.</p><p>And then life is misery. See this and go beyond.</p><p>In fact, <strong>the very seeing of the fact is going
beyond.</strong> And please, do not ask the seemingly inevitable: How?
Because there is no HOW to it.</p><p>Either you SEE it or you do not see it.</p><p>And, moreover, the How is again the creator of conflict.</p><p><br></p><p>19-5-1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p>Love. <strong>Knowledge is through experiencing. More information is
not knowledge.</strong></p><p>On the contrary, it cannot give the clarity which knowledge gives to
the mind, and may confuse one more.</p><p>Because, a confused mind is still more burdened with it.</p><p>Two men had played chess regularly together for several years. They
were quite evenly matched, and there was keen rivalry between them. And
then, one man began to beat his rival nearly every time they played. And
the other man was completely at a loss to understand this phenomenon. On
the contrary, he was expecting his game to improve because he was
reading a 4-volume set on 'HOW TO PLAY CHESS'. After much thought, he
came up with an idea. He sent the books to his friend as a gift. And it
was not long before they were evenly matched again!</p><p><br></p><p>27-5-1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p>Love. It is very easy to progress from one illusion to another.

the foundations.</p><p>Because, you remain the same.</p><h4 style=padding-left:33pt;text-indent:0;line-height:14pt;text-align:left id=so-the-real-problem-is-not-to-change-the-objects-of-desire.>So the

look into it. It was night, and as he peered into the deep water, he saw
the moon's reflection there.</p><p>"I must save the moon!" the Mulla thought. "Otherwise she will never
wane and the fasting month of Ramazan will never come to an end."</p><p>He found a rope, threw it in and called down: "Hold tight, keep
bright; succour is at hand!"</p><p>The rope caught in a rock inside the well, and Nasrudin heaved as
hard as he could. Straining back, he suddenly felt the rope give way as
it became loose, and he was thrown on his back. As he lay there,
panting, he saw the moon riding on the sky.</p><p>"Glad to be of service," said Nasrudin. "Just as well I came along,
wasn't it?"</p><p><br></p><p>22-5-1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. Anger, violence, greed or envy cannot be overcome by the
cultivation of their opposites.</p><p>Because anger itself will cultivate its opposite.</p><p>And violence will be present in its cultivated non-violence. So
<strong>always be aware of the hypnotic spell of the opposite.</strong>
It never solves any problem.</p><p>Because it is beating around the bush. Do not fall into the trap of
the opposite.</p><p>But understand anger, violence or greed or anything else
directly.</p><h4 style=padding-left:33pt;text-indent:0;line-height:14pt;text-align:left id=to-seek-the-opposite-is-a-way-of-escape.>To seek the opposite is a

is a change.</p><p>Awareness acts as a catalytic agent.</p><p>And then anger does not change into its opposite. It is not that

self-destructive.</h4><p>And ultimately suicidal.</p><p>But ordinarily the mind works that way.</p><p>Because it is only an instrument for safety and security. It detects
death only and not LIFE.</p><p>So <strong>to be completely positive is to transcend
mind.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Some Fakir was asked to talk to a group about the negative nature of
the mind. He tacked up on the wall a large sheet of perfectly white
paper. He made a black spot in the paper with a pencil. Then he asked
each man to say what he saw. Each man replied, “A black spot.” The Fakir
then said, "Yes, there is a little black spot. <strong>But not one of
you saw the big expanse of white paper. And that is the point of my
speech."</strong></p><p>22-5-1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. The mind always thinks in terms of the self. It is
ego-centric.</p><p>During the French revolution a man from Paris stopped at a village
and was asked by a friend what was happening. "They are cutting off
heads by thousands," said the visitor. "How terrible!" cried the
villager. "That could ruin my hat business!"</p><p>But this is the way of the mind.</p><p>And because of this it is never in tune with the cosmos. So how can
it know LIFE?</p><p>It cannot know it, because it cannot be one with it. Really with the
mind there is no knowing - but only superficial acquaintance.</p><h4 style=padding-left:33pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-intimate-and-deep-knowing-comes-only-with-no--mind.>The

useful than the sun."</p><p>"But, why?" asked someone.</p><p>"We need the light more during the night than during the day."</p><p>And, I say to you that all our metaphysical theories and explanations
are not of more worth than the explanation of that madman.</p><p><br></p><p>26-5-1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. There was once a man who was obsessed with the idea that there
was a secret knower in those who achieved success.</p><p>To discover this secret he devoted years to study and re- search.
Ancient Masonry, Philosophy, Astrology, Psychology, Salesmanship,
Religious beliefs, the various cults that have had their rise and fall -
all these he studied long and diligently. But no conclusion was visible.
He struggled and struggled, but still there was no conclusion. And then
instead of success in his search for the secret of success came death.
And as death approached him he realized the goal of his whole life's
efforts, and finally he gave his conclusion to those who were near him.
It came in two short words: "I WILL."</p><p>30-5-1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. Metaphysics is born out of childish curiosity. So howsoever
sublime, it remains juvenile.</p><p>And all the ultimate answers are foolish in a way.</p><p>Because the ultimate is not only unknown, it is unknowable. A mature
mind is one who understands the impossibility of knowing the
ultimate.</p><p>And, with this understanding, there is a new dimension. The dimension
of BEING.</p><h4 style=padding-left:33pt;text-indent:0;line-height:14pt;text-align:left id=knowing-is-not-possible-but-being-is.>Knowing is not possible, but
BEING is.</h4><p>Or in other words, <strong>in relation to the Ultimate only, Being is
KNOWING.</strong></p><p>This dimension is the religious dimension,</p><p>And unless one is religious in this sense, one goes on asking absurd
questions and accumulating even more absurd answers.</p><p>In a little backwoods school the teacher was at the black- board
explaining arithmetic problems. She was delighted to see her dullest
pupil giving slack-jawed attention, which was unusual for him. Her happy
thought was that, at last, the gangling lad was beginning to
understand.</p><p>When she finished she said to him, "You were so interested, Cicero,
that I am sure you want to ask some questions?" "Yes'm." drawled Cicero,
"I got one to ask. Where do these figures go when you rub them off?"</p><p><br></p><p>30-5-1971</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved Bhakti,</p><p><br></p><p>Love. If the present is just continuous with the past then it is not
present at all.</p><p>To be present, the present must be discontinuous with the past.</p><p>Only then it is young, fresh and new.</p><p>And then it is not a part of time, but is eternity itself.</p><h4 style=padding-left:33pt;text-indent:0;line-height:14pt;text-align:left id=the-now-is-eternal.>The NOW is eternal.</h4><p>But we live in the past or in the future which is nothing but a faint
echo of the past itself.</p><p>Our whole activity springs from the past or for the future which is
the same thing.</p><p>Then the present is false and dead.</p><p>And if the present is false then we cannot be real. <strong>And if
the present is dead then we cannot be alive.</strong> That is why I
insist to live in the present.</p><p>And to die each moment for the past.</p><h4 style=padding-left:33pt;text-indent:0;line-height:14pt;text-align:left id=live-atomically---moment-to-moment.>Live atomically - moment to
moment.</h4><p>And then your life will have a totally different quality - the
quality of Divine.</p><p>10-5-1971</p></div></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2024 <a href=https://osho.lol/>Osho - The complete works of Osho</a></span> ·

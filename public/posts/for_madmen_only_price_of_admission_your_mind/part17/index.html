I think she hasn’t decided whether she wants to stay her or not in this world.]\nLet her decide – give her freedom.\n[She asks: How can I watch all these problems? How can I be aware? It’s hard.]\nIt is hard, but people don’t listen to me, so... You take the responsibility, then you... People don’t listen to me. If I tell them not to have children they get angry, mm? Just yesterday one woman wrote a very angry letter because I suggested to her that it was better not to have a child – now she thinks I am a monster!\nThen it is her responsibility. Whatsoever you feel, do – and even if it is hard, you have to watch it. What can you do? It is better to be alert from the very beginning. To give birth to a child is to give birth to a thousand and one responsibilities, and one never knows... there are bound to be problems.\nWhen a person is alone there are no problems really. The only problem is that he feels lonely – and that is not a big problem at all, because if one starts being a little alert of that loneliness it turns into aloneness and one can enjoy it. But when a person is alone he feels lonely, he feels he is miserable. Then he finds a partner, falls in love, this and that. Only when he has got into a relationship does he remember how happy he was before – but now it is too late!\nAnd even if he becomes alone again he will start suffering again from the loneliness – because people’s memories are very short; they don’t remember. Again he will start looking for a woman or a man; and whenever there is a relationship there is trouble. But troubles don’t stop there: once you are related with a man, you start thinking of becoming a mother – then the third person enters\nin. Now, the third person is even more dangerous – because the man you choose you choose knowingly, knowing what type of man you are choosing. But the child? – you cannot choose the child. One never knows what type of child will enter you and what is going to happen; it is a blind game. The child comes in. Then one feels it would be better if one were without a child, but now it is too late.\nNow be alert next time you start thinking of becoming pregnant. And that’s how the mind works. The mind will say, ‘Maybe this child didn’t turn out very good – why not have another?’ And so on and so forth; one goes on wasting one’s whole life. And there is no end to it!\nNow the child will grow, there will be growth problems, the child will start doing things which you don’t like, the child may turn out to be a criminal. Or one never knows, it is unpredictable. One goes on and on, and goes on getting involved.\nKeep alert and learn a lesson from it, that these foolish things have to be avoided if you really want to grow, otherwise the whole energy and time will be wasted in these things and growth suffers.\nAnd why do people choose these things? First, they are lonely. So they w ant to avoid themselves, they want to escape from themselves. It is not love, it has nothing to do with love they simply don’t want to be lonely. It is an escape. So they find somebody – and that person also is lonely and seeking, searching for somebody. Now two lonely persons meet – it is not going to give any joy; they are too needful. They will exploit each other, dominate each other, be jealous, and always afraid that the other may leave and then again they may be lonely. So they cling to each other, and the more they cling, the more heavy the relationship becomes and the more they start thinking it would have been better if they were alone.\nBut now they are entangled, committed. They have promised; now it is difficult to go against the promises, so they carry on. Then they start thinking ‘Why not have a child?’ That child is again a trick to escape – to escape from the relationship.\nFirst you escape from yourself, fall in love, then the relationship becomes heavy. You want to have a child so that you can escape into the child, so you can forget about the husband, so you can look after the child and you can live through the child and you can hope and dream through the child. That is again an escape.\nThese are ways how one goes on escaping. So just be alert – whatsoever you have done, you have done, mm? so be watchful. And next time be mindful! Nothing can be done now about the past, but about the future much can be done. Let it be a great lesson not to get entangled unnecessarily. And when you get into any responsibility, think over it, meditate over it. Only get into it with full awareness that there may be problems.\nAlways hope for the best and expect the worst. And keep both in mind – that the worst is going to happen, is possible: expect it, so that when it happens there is no misery. Hope for the best – because without hope it will be difficult for you to live right now. You can live without hope only when you have disappeared. Then one can live without hope and without frustration, because when you don’t hope there is no expectation and there is no frustration. Then whatsoever happens one accepts it.\nBut right now just be alert and do whatsoever you can do for the child. Mm? it is your choice, and maybe it is something which is going to help you in your growth. So use the opportunity! Always use all the opportunities for growth. There is not a single opportunity which cannot be used as a jumping-board for growth. Now the child is there; the child is not according to your expectations. So learn one thing, that to expect is bad and that the world is not here to fulfill your expectations. So learn one thing and a beautiful thing can come out of it.\nNow the second thing. Who knows? – all the limitations that the child has may prove good finally. One can never say – the handicap may prove good. Just think, if adolf hitler had been born blind it would have been a great blessing to the world, or if he was crippled it would have been a great blessing to the world. But he was not crippled, he was not blind, he had enough energy: the whole world suffered.\nSo we cannot know the future. Whatsoever has happened, accept it and use it for more awareness, for more alertness. Next time, before entering into any responsibility, meditate, and remember that what you are hoping for may never turn up and something just the opposite may turn up: are you ready to accept the opposite?\nIf you are ready, then go into it. If you are not ready, it is better not to enter into it. So use this opportunity – and to me, each opportunity can be used.\nYou are feeling angry: watch the anger and analyse the anger. Enter the anger and try to find why you are feeling angry. Somebody has insulted you, but why does the insult hurt you? Because finally it is your interpretation – nobody’s insult can hurt you unless you decide to be hurt by it. So you have decided to be hurt; it is your ego. You were not expecting this; you were thinking that he would praise you, and he has insulted you. So now never expect praise, and if somebody insults you then see – it will not hurt.\nWhatsoever happens around you, you are continuously interpreting. Now the child is not healthy – that too is your interpretation. Who knows?\nJust a few days ago I was talking about Asthavakra, mm? His name means he was bent in his body at eight points – his whole body was like a camel. He could not walk properly, impossible; in eight places his body had something wrong. He was a caricature – but he proved to be one of the greatest mystics of the world.\nThe father must have cried and wept, the mother must have beaten her head when she saw this child: all wrong, nothing right. But this child proved to be one of the greatest seers india has produced. And his book, asthavakrasanta, is incomparable in the whole world’s literature. No bible, no koran, no veda, no gita, has anything comparable to it. It is simply transcendental! So, one never knows.…\nThe child is not according to your expectation, that’s why it hurts. Drop the expectation. Now the child is there: it is god’s gift – enjoy whatsoever has been given. Accept it in deep humility and gratitude, and then see what happens, mm? Good.\nPrem jiten. It means conquered by love. And that’s all that one has to do – allow love to conquer one. And love is something that is bigger than you: you cannot possess it, you can only be possessed\nby it. And people who try to possess love kill love. Then in their hands something else is left; it is not love – maybe a corpse, something dead. Only something dead can be possessed, only things can be possessed. Even if you possess a person, the person becomes a thing immediately. If you possess the wife, the wife is a thing, no more a person. If you possess a friend, the friend is a thing, no more a person – just like the house and the car.\nAll that is great and all that is beautiful, one has to allow. You cannot possess it, you can only be possessed – and that is the fear. We want everything under control. And god cannot be under control, love cannot be under control, truth cannot be under control. So we are even ready to accept lies, but at any cost we want to control, we want to remain in control.\nThis ego is the only barrier – and the ego is the idea to possess, to conquer, to have. Yes, you can have many things, but you will have a dead world. You will have king midas’ world: whatsoever he touches turns into gold – but he cannot eat gold, he cannot drink gold, he cannot love gold. And the ego has that touch: whatsoever it touches becomes a thing. And you need persons, not things; you need the whole world to be full of personality, throbbing with life and aliveness.\nSo I am giving you this name just as an indicator, to remind you again and again to learn to dispossess and to be possessed. Learn to surrender, open the gates of your heart so that the whole can overflood you, so that you are almost drowned and taken away.\nAnd that is the state of the mystic when he is possessed by love – he is a drunkard. And you can become one! That is everybody’s birthright. If we miss it, nobody else but ourselves is responsible. We could have it – it was ours just for the asking.\n[The new sannyasin said he had been training as a therapist but he dropped out, because he felt he was in it for the wrong reasons and not out of love for it.]\nThat’s very good – that feeling is very good. In fact that’s what is happening in the west. And therapy is a function of love; it has not much to do with the technique. You can be a gestalt therapist or you can be a primal therapist or you can be anything else: if you love, techniques work. In fact love works; the technique is just an excuse. The therapist works, not the therapy.\nSo sometimes when there is a man like Perls, something starts happening. It is not gestalt, mm? it is the personality of the man – his tremendous courage, compassion. He tries to help; he tries to reach the other person.\nBut our logical mind says that it must he the gestalt therapy that is helping; and that has been the fallacy down the ages. It is not christianity that helps, it was christ. And it is nothing to do with buddhism, it was buddha. For twenty-five hundred years people have been thinking that it was Buddhism that helped people. It was not Buddhism, it was Buddha. If Buddha had been saying something else, that too would have been of help. Even if he had said just the opposite to whatsoever he said, then too it would have helped. It was the person, it was the life force of that man, the compassion and his love and his understanding, that helped.\nBut our minds immediately catch hold of the techniques, of the superficial. Then the superficial becomes important and we lose contact with the primary, the essential. And there are problems:\nthe essential cannot be taught, only the non-essential can be taught. So you cannot teach Fritz Perls – you can teach gestalt. Fritz Perls happens when it happens; there is no way to teach that! But the society cannot depend on such accidental happenings. The society wants to be certain about something, so it starts teaching, and only the non-essential can be taught.\nSo all teaching goes against the teacher, because the teacher brings the essential and the teaching teaches the non-essential, only the periphery. And by and by the periphery becomes so loaded with knowledge, information, research, that the essential is completely lost track of.\nIt is very difficult to find out what buddha said, what type of man, what manner of man he was; it is almost impossible. Two thousand and five hundred years of scholarship – it is such a big jungle you cannot find where Buddha is sitting, where his bodhitree is.\nAnd you will find thousands and thousands of pretenders. Sometimes pretenders are so skillful that they can even defeat the real Buddha. That too is a problem – because a real Buddha has all the limitations of reality and the pretender has none of the limitations of reality. A Buddha is spontaneous, so he can err – but the pretender never errs because he rehearses, he practises.\n[Osho recounts how, when Charlie Chaplin entered a competition that was set up to find the person who could best imitate Charlie Chaplin, Charlie Chaplin only came second!]\nThe real can be defeated by the unreal because the unreal can practise. For the real there is no way to practise – one has to live moment-to-moment; whatsoever situation comes he will respond. The unreal knows all the situations beforehand and he knows beforehand how he has to respond – he has a script. So the teaching becomes of the non-essential, and teaching falls into the hands of the hypocrites.\nIt was good that you realised it. With that very realisation, much more becomes possible. In fact, from that very moment the journey has started towards reality. To know the false as the false – to feel that something is a pretension and you don’t have anything to give, so how can you give? – is to start moving towards the real. Mm? it was a great moment of blessing that you recognised that, and now things can move in a totally different direction. It is good that you have come!\nSo meditate here, feel my presence, drink me as much as you can... become a drunkard! [A visitor says: I’m on a honeymoon with me. It’s exciting.]\nMm mm – one can be on this honeymoon for the whole of life. One should be, but religions have destroyed the very possibility – christianity more so, and particularly catholicism. They have really poisoned all life sources, and guilt is the poison.\nThey have fabricated the whole thing, the whole conspiracy, with such skill, with such efficiency and expertise, that it is very difficult for a man to see through and through what has been done to his life. In fact the moment you ever become aware of the whole nonsense that has been done... To have that moment of awareness becomes almost impossible, because the conditioning penetrates to such deep layers of the unconscious.\n... and once the guilt is dropped, life is really a honeymoon; it is a tremendous joy. And one has to be selfish! All teachings about being unselfish and sacrificing to others and doing this and that are simply idiotic – and they don’t help anybody! You don’t become unselfish, you remain selfish; it is just that you remain guilty. They don’t destroy your life, they just poison your sources.\nSo if you are alert, and these moments are beautiful, get rid of it forever – because these habits follow you; even dead habits follow you.\n[The visitor adds: I want to say about sannyas that I couldn’t make up my mind. What is happening is that I am already a sannyasin to me, to my very existence. I have felt really a lot of pressure here at the ashram of “When are you going to do it?” It happens a lot.]\nThey know better... they know better!\nThere are a few things to be understood. It is very simple but very deep-going. It is as if a person decides alone to himself that he will not smoke, and he says nothing to anybody: there are ninety- nine chances that he will smoke. Now the second person decides that he will not smoke and he goes and tells everybody – to ali the friends, to all the society, he goes and says that he has decided not to smoke. There are ninety percent chances that he will still smoke.\nFirst there were ninety-nine chances that he would smoke; now there are ninety chances that he will still smoke, but there is nine percent less possibility.\nThe third possibility is that he joins a society of non-smokers where nobody smokes. Now there are ninety-nine percent chances that he will not smoke.\nGurdjieff used to say that if you want to do something, find a few friends so that you can do it together.\nIt is almost as if you are imprisoned in a gaol: you want to escape, but to escape alone will be very difficult. If you make a gang the possibility is more: you can kill the guard – alone it will be very difficult; you can break the wall – alone it will be very difficult. But still there is a possibility you may not be able to succeed, because your gang will be a small gang of prisoners, helpless prisoners. The forces who manage the gaol are bigger than you.\nThe third thing, the best thing, is make contact with people who are outside, who are already free, who are not in the gaol, who can supply things to you, who can manage, who can give you the map, who can bribe the guards, who can take the gaoler away for a picnic, who can manage a thousand and one things.\nSannyas has nothing to do with orangeyou will have to wear orange. But sannyas has nothing\nto do with orange: it is just a declaration, a gesture, that you are not alone, that you are part of my family.\nIt is a gesture that you are ready to stake your life with me, that you are ready to gamble. It is a gamble – who knows? I may be wrong. Who knows? I may not really be out of the gaol, maybe I am just pretending... I may be the gaoler himself! Nobody can ever be certain about it. So it is a gamble, it is a trust. Trust is always a gamble.\nJust the other day I was reading – it has come to light only within these last ten or twelve years – that if somebody has taken LSD and is high on it, turned on, sometimes it happens that if you love the person and you just sit by his side, you turn on. Now, you have not taken LSD, but if you love the person something telepathic happens, something communicates with your inner being.\nHis state of being turned on, somehow becomes an opening to you – if you love the person. If you are in a communion with the person, you suddenly feel that you are on the LSD-trip yourself.\nThis has happened only within ten, fifteen years since drugs became so available to the new generation, but in the east we have always known it. And exactly the same is the situation with spirituality – more so.\nA man is turned on: we call him the master. Just being in tune with him, suddenly your lives are turned on.\nSannyas is just to fall in tune with me. These are outward gestures of falling in tune with me. They simply show that you are ready – for the inner you are ready, and you are even ready for the outer. If the master says to go and dance naked in the streets, the disciple dances. Not that this nakedness is going to help in any way, but the gesture that he follows the master.…\n[Osho recounts the tale of Ibrahim, a Mohammedan king, whose task, before being initiated by a mystic, was to dance naked in the streets of his own kingdom, beating his head with a shoe.\nHe followed the master’s order without demurring and returned a transformed being.]\nSo these things are just gestures. Not that by wearing orange you will become enlightened, not that by becoming naked or beating your head with the shoe you will become enlightened, but these are gestures of falling in tune with me. Even if I say something which has no logic in it.Why not green,\nwhy not white, why not blue? No logic in it – it is illogical.\nI could have chosen green, but that would have been the same. I had to choose some colour – but this is just a gesture to make you part of a family, to make you part of me, so you become associated with me, so your responsibilities are my responsibilities, so we are staked together, so our commitment is together.\nIf you want to think, think about it. But the better course is to jump without thinking – and the benefit will be far more. But if you feel like thinking, you can think for a few days.\n[A sannyasin couple speak to Osho. The woman says she has difficulty adjusting to rest and work hours in her work and relationship.]\nMy feeling is that if your body rhythm does not like getting up late in the morning and going late to bed, then it is better to follow the body rhythm. Otherwise you will become irritated, and you will start taking revenge on him [the boyfriend]. It will be very unconscious revenge and that will destroy the whole beauty of the relationship. He will not even be able to know why you are getting irritated, why you said certain things. Because the body rhythm is very very important to understand. And it cannot be changed, that is one thing about it – there is no way to change the body rhythm. It settles the moment you are born.You will never be able to change it.\n[She answers: I don’t know why I do this... not allow myself to have enough sleep – I think I must do this thing and this thing... especially things that you have given me.]\nNo, no – nothing. I give you this work: to sleep as much as you can... Now there is no problem; you have to follow my instructions.\nSo now this is work and you have to do it!\nSo just watch your rhythm. If you feel like going to bed early, then go early and get up early in the morning. And once you have understood what time suits you, it is better to be regular about it. If it is possible, then be regular; if sometimes it is not possible then it’s okay, but don’t make irregularity a normal routine.\nAnd the body rhythm is more important than you are aware of. It creates many difficulties in relationship. People start trying to adjust to each other – rather than adjusting to their body rhythms, they start to adjust with each other, naturally. The wife thinks to adjust with the husband, the husband thinks to adjust with the wife – but this adjustment is impossible. So sooner or later they start taking revenge, and that is very unconscious. Small things can destroy beautiful things; very small things, not very big, just very small things can destroy.\nSo just listen to your body, and then adjust the relationship according to the body rather than adjusting the body according to the relationship. If it is difficult, if [he] feels to go to bed late, he can go. Mm? then see him in the day, meet him in the day. If it is not possible in the night, then let it be day. But first... and he has not to be forced either, mm? otherwise the other extreme can happen, that he has to go early with you and he has to get up early. That will disturb him.\nAnd this is something, that whatsoever you do, there is no way to change the rhythm. The rhythm is a fixed thing It gets into your system the day you are born and it leaves you only the day you die.\nNow much research has been done on body rhythm, and there seems to be no possibility to change it. It is something in the very cells; the cells are programmed. And it is beyond the conscious control. You can force – one can force oneself to be awake or go to sleep and take a tranquiliser and force sleep – but you cannot change the inner structure of the cell, it is there.\nMany experiments have been done on animals and on birds. There are birds who fall asleep as the sun sets. So this has been the understanding, that it is the sun: when the sun sets they feel that the darkness has come, they fall asleep. So they were put in artificial chambers and deceived. When it was night outside there was light in the chamber, and when it was day outside there was night in the chamber. They were there for months together. They became neurotic birds – they started committing suicide or killing each other – but the body rhythm could not be changed.\nThey would fall asleep while it was day in the chamber and they would become awake when it was night in the chamber. And of course it was very strange for their bodies to be awake in the night – they started feeling something eerie, something weird, and that started telling on their systems, and they became very irritated.\nMany things happen when an animal becomes irritated, his sexuality becomes perverted. Animals become homosexual when their body is too irritated, or they start masturbating. Ordinarily they\nare never mad, but they start becoming mad. Ordinarily birds never commit suicide, but in those chambers they tried to commit suicide; the whole thing became too heavy. And it was a simple thing, they just had to adjust their body rhythm – but what could they do? It is impossible, unless some day in the future they can change the very programme of the cell. It is not possible before that, and one should not try.\nSo simply follow your own rhythms – there is no obligation to adjust with the other – and then you will feel more loving. In fact, love gives freedom to the other to be the way he is – the way he feels happy, the way he feels blissful. Love gives freedom; it never forces the other to adjust to a certain artificial structure. Even if you cannot see each other as much, it is good, nothing wrong. Even seeing each other for a few hours is very good, but giving freedom to each other to be themselves is important.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"4822","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/for_madmen_only_price_of_admission_your_mind/part17/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/for_madmen_only_price_of_admission_your_mind/>For Madmen Only (Price of Admission.

been well. I think she hasn’t decided whether she wants to stay her or
not in this world.]</p><p><br></p><p>Let her decide – give her freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>[She asks: How can I watch all these problems? How can I be aware?
It’s hard.]</p><p><br></p><p>It is hard, but people don’t listen to me, so... You take the
responsibility, then you... People don’t listen to me. If I tell them
not to have children they get angry, mm? Just yesterday one woman wrote
a very angry letter because I suggested to her that it was better not to
have a child – now she thinks I am a monster!</p><p><br></p><p>Then it is her responsibility. Whatsoever you feel, do – and even if
it is hard, you have to watch it. What can you do? It is better to be
alert from the very beginning. To give birth to a child is to give birth
to a thousand and one responsibilities, and one never knows... there are
bound to be problems.</p><p><br></p><p>When a person is alone there are no problems really. The only problem
is that he feels lonely – and that is not a big problem at all, because
if one starts being a little alert of that loneliness it turns into
aloneness and one can enjoy it. But when a person is alone he feels
lonely, he feels he is miserable. Then he finds a partner, falls in
love, this and that. Only when he has got into a relationship does he
remember how happy he was before – but now it is too late!</p><p><br></p><p>And even if he becomes alone again he will start suffering again from
the loneliness – because people’s memories are very short; they don’t
remember. Again he will start looking for a woman or a man; and whenever
there is a relationship there is trouble. But troubles don’t stop there:
once you are related with a man, you start thinking of becoming a mother
– then the third person enters</p><p><br></p><p>in. Now, the third person is even more dangerous – because the man
you choose you choose knowingly, knowing what type of man you are
choosing. But the child? – you cannot choose the child. One never knows
what type of child will enter you and what is going to happen; it is a
blind game. The child comes in. Then one feels it would be better if one
were without a child, but now it is too late.</p><p><br></p><p>Now be alert next time you start thinking of becoming pregnant. And
that’s how the mind works. The mind will say, ‘Maybe this child didn’t
turn out very good – why not have another?’ And so on and so forth; one
goes on wasting one’s whole life. And there is no end to it!</p><p><br></p><p>Now the child will grow, there will be growth problems, the child
will start doing things which you don’t like, the child may turn out to
be a criminal. Or one never knows, it is unpredictable. One goes on and
on, and goes on getting involved.</p><p><br></p><p>Keep alert and learn a lesson from it, that these foolish things have
to be avoided if you really want to grow, otherwise the whole energy and
time will be wasted in these things and growth suffers.</p><p><br></p><p>And why do people choose these things? First, they are lonely. So
they w ant to avoid themselves, they want to escape from themselves. It
is not love, it has nothing to do with love they simply don’t want to be
lonely. It is an escape. So they find somebody – and that person also is
lonely and seeking, searching for somebody. Now two lonely persons meet
– it is not going to give any joy; they are too needful. They will
exploit each other, dominate each other, be jealous, and always afraid
that the other may leave and then again they may be lonely. So they
cling to each other, and the more they cling, the more heavy the
relationship becomes and the more they start thinking it would have been
better if they were alone.</p><p><br></p><p>But now they are entangled, committed. They have promised; now it is
difficult to go against the promises, so they carry on. Then they start
thinking ‘Why not have a child?’ That child is again a trick to escape –
to escape from the relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>First you escape from yourself, fall in love, then the relationship
becomes heavy. You want to have a child so that you can escape into the
child, so you can forget about the husband, so you can look after the
child and you can live through the child and you can hope and dream
through the child. That is again an escape.</p><p><br></p><p>These are ways how one goes on escaping. So just be alert –
whatsoever you have done, you have done, mm? so be watchful. And next
time be mindful! Nothing can be done now about the past, but about the
future much can be done. Let it be a great lesson not to get entangled
unnecessarily. And when you get into any responsibility, think over it,
meditate over it. Only get into it with full awareness that there may be
problems.</p><p><br></p><p>Always hope for the best and expect the worst. And keep both in mind
– that the worst is going to happen, is possible: expect it, so that
when it happens there is no misery. Hope for the best – because without
hope it will be difficult for you to live right now. You can live
without hope only when you have disappeared. Then one can live without
hope and without frustration, because when you don’t hope there is no
expectation and there is no frustration. Then whatsoever happens one
accepts it.</p><p><br></p><p>But right now just be alert and do whatsoever you can do for the
child. Mm? it is your choice, and maybe it is something which is going
to help you in your growth. So use the opportunity! Always use all the
opportunities for growth. There is not a single opportunity which cannot
be used as a jumping-board for growth. Now the child is there; the child
is not according to your expectations. So learn one thing, that to
expect is bad and that the world is not here to fulfill your
expectations. So learn one thing and a beautiful thing can come out of
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the second thing. Who knows? – all the limitations that the child
has may prove good finally. One can never say – the handicap may prove
good. Just think, if adolf hitler had been born blind it would have been
a great blessing to the world, or if he was crippled it would have been
a great blessing to the world. But he was not crippled, he was not
blind, he had enough energy: the whole world suffered.</p><p><br></p><p>So we cannot know the future. Whatsoever has happened, accept it and
use it for more awareness, for more alertness. Next time, before
entering into any responsibility, meditate, and remember that what you
are hoping for may never turn up and something just the opposite may
turn up: are you ready to accept the opposite?</p><p><br></p><p>If you are ready, then go into it. If you are not ready, it is better
not to enter into it. So use this opportunity – and to me, each
opportunity can be used.</p><p><br></p><p>You are feeling angry: watch the anger and analyse the anger. Enter
the anger and try to find why you are feeling angry. Somebody has
insulted you, but why does the insult hurt you? Because finally it is
your interpretation – nobody’s insult can hurt you unless you decide to
be hurt by it. So you have decided to be hurt; it is your ego. You were
not expecting this; you were thinking that he would praise you, and he
has insulted you. So now never expect praise, and if somebody insults
you then see – it will not hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever happens around you, you are continuously interpreting. Now
the child is not healthy – that too is your interpretation. Who
knows?</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days ago I was talking about Asthavakra, mm? His name
means he was bent in his body at eight points – his whole body was like
a camel. He could not walk properly, impossible; in eight places his
body had something wrong. He was a caricature – but he proved to be one
of the greatest mystics of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>The father must have cried and wept, the mother must have beaten her
head when she saw this child: all wrong, nothing right. But this child
proved to be one of the greatest seers india has produced. And his book,
asthavakrasanta, is incomparable in the whole world’s literature. No
bible, no koran, no veda, no gita, has anything comparable to it. It is
simply transcendental! So, one never knows.…</p><p><br></p><p>The child is not according to your expectation, that’s why it hurts.
Drop the expectation. Now the child is there: it is god’s gift – enjoy
whatsoever has been given. Accept it in deep humility and gratitude, and
then see what happens, mm? Good.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem jiten. It means conquered by love. And that’s all that one has
to do – allow love to conquer one. And love is something that is bigger
than you: you cannot possess it, you can only be possessed</p><p><br></p><p>by it. And people who try to possess love kill love. Then in their
hands something else is left; it is not love – maybe a corpse, something
dead. Only something dead can be possessed, only things can be
possessed. Even if you possess a person, the person becomes a thing
immediately. If you possess the wife, the wife is a thing, no more a
person. If you possess a friend, the friend is a thing, no more a person
– just like the house and the car.</p><p><br></p><p>All that is great and all that is beautiful, one has to allow. You
cannot possess it, you can only be possessed – and that is the fear. We
want everything under control. And god cannot be under control, love
cannot be under control, truth cannot be under control. So we are even
ready to accept lies, but at any cost we want to control, we want to
remain in control.</p><p><br></p><p>This ego is the only barrier – and the ego is the idea to possess, to
conquer, to have. Yes, you can have many things, but you will have a
dead world. You will have king midas’ world: whatsoever he touches turns
into gold – but he cannot eat gold, he cannot drink gold, he cannot love
gold. And the ego has that touch: whatsoever it touches becomes a thing.
And you need persons, not things; you need the whole world to be full of
personality, throbbing with life and aliveness.</p><p><br></p><p>So I am giving you this name just as an indicator, to remind you
again and again to learn to dispossess and to be possessed. Learn to
surrender, open the gates of your heart so that the whole can overflood
you, so that you are almost drowned and taken away.</p><p><br></p><p>And that is the state of the mystic when he is possessed by love – he
is a drunkard. And you can become one! That is everybody’s birthright.
If we miss it, nobody else but ourselves is responsible. We could have
it – it was ours just for the asking.</p><p><br></p><p>[The new sannyasin said he had been training as a therapist but he
dropped out, because he felt he was in it for the wrong reasons and not
out of love for it.]</p><p><br></p><p>That’s very good – that feeling is very good. In fact that’s what is
happening in the west. And therapy is a function of love; it has not
much to do with the technique. You can be a gestalt therapist or you can
be a primal therapist or you can be anything else: if you love,
techniques work. In fact love works; the technique is just an excuse.
The therapist works, not the therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>So sometimes when there is a man like Perls, something starts
happening. It is not gestalt, mm? it is the personality of the man – his
tremendous courage, compassion. He tries to help; he tries to reach the
other person.</p><p><br></p><p>But our logical mind says that it must he the gestalt therapy that is
helping; and that has been the fallacy down the ages. It is not
christianity that helps, it was christ. And it is nothing to do with
buddhism, it was buddha. For twenty-five hundred years people have been
thinking that it was Buddhism that helped people. It was not Buddhism,
it was Buddha. If Buddha had been saying something else, that too would
have been of help. Even if he had said just the opposite to whatsoever
he said, then too it would have helped. It was the person, it was the
life force of that man, the compassion and his love and his
understanding, that helped.</p><p><br></p><p>But our minds immediately catch hold of the techniques, of the
superficial. Then the superficial becomes important and we lose contact
with the primary, the essential. And there are problems:</p><p><br></p><p>the essential cannot be taught, only the non-essential can be taught.
So you cannot teach Fritz Perls – you can teach gestalt. Fritz Perls
happens when it happens; there is no way to teach that! But the society
cannot depend on such accidental happenings. The society wants to be
certain about something, so it starts teaching, and only the
non-essential can be taught.</p><p><br></p><p>So all teaching goes against the teacher, because the teacher brings
the essential and the teaching teaches the non-essential, only the
periphery. And by and by the periphery becomes so loaded with knowledge,
information, research, that the essential is completely lost track
of.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very difficult to find out what buddha said, what type of man,
what manner of man he was; it is almost impossible. Two thousand and
five hundred years of scholarship – it is such a big jungle you cannot
find where Buddha is sitting, where his bodhitree is.</p><p><br></p><p>And you will find thousands and thousands of pretenders. Sometimes
pretenders are so skillful that they can even defeat the real Buddha.
That too is a problem – because a real Buddha has all the limitations of
reality and the pretender has none of the limitations of reality. A
Buddha is spontaneous, so he can err – but the pretender never errs
because he rehearses, he practises.</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho recounts how, when Charlie Chaplin entered a competition that
was set up to find the person who could best imitate Charlie Chaplin,
Charlie Chaplin only came second!]</p><p><br></p><p>The real can be defeated by the unreal because the unreal can
practise. For the real there is no way to practise – one has to live
moment-to-moment; whatsoever situation comes he will respond. The unreal
knows all the situations beforehand and he knows beforehand how he has
to respond – he has a script. So the teaching becomes of the
non-essential, and teaching falls into the hands of the hypocrites.</p><p><br></p><p>It was good that you realised it. With that very realisation, much
more becomes possible. In fact, from that very moment the journey has
started towards reality. To know the false as the false – to feel that
something is a pretension and you don’t have anything to give, so how
can you give? – is to start moving towards the real. Mm? it was a great
moment of blessing that you recognised that, and now things can move in
a totally different direction. It is good that you have come!</p><p><br></p><p>So meditate here, feel my presence, drink me as much as you can...
become a drunkard! [A visitor says: I’m on a honeymoon with me. It’s
exciting.]</p><p>Mm mm – one can be on this honeymoon for the whole of life. One
should be, but religions have destroyed the very possibility –
christianity more so, and particularly catholicism. They have really
poisoned all life sources, and guilt is the poison.</p><p><br></p><p>They have fabricated the whole thing, the whole conspiracy, with such
skill, with such efficiency and expertise, that it is very difficult for
a man to see through and through what has been done to his life. In fact
the moment you ever become aware of the whole nonsense that has been
done... To have that moment of awareness becomes almost impossible,
because the conditioning penetrates to such deep layers of the
unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>... and once the guilt is dropped, life is really a honeymoon; it is
a tremendous joy. And one has to be selfish! All teachings about being
unselfish and sacrificing to others and doing this and that are simply
idiotic – and they don’t help anybody! You don’t become unselfish, you
remain selfish; it is just that you remain guilty. They don’t destroy
your life, they just poison your sources.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you are alert, and these moments are beautiful, get rid of it
forever – because these habits follow you; even dead habits follow
you.</p><p><br></p><p>[The visitor adds: I want to say about sannyas that I couldn’t make
up my mind. What is happening is that I am already a sannyasin to me, to
my very existence. I have felt really a lot of pressure here at the
ashram of “When are you going to do it?” It happens a lot.]</p><p><br></p><p>They know better... they know better!</p><p><br></p><p>There are a few things to be understood. It is very simple but very
deep-going. It is as if a person decides alone to himself that he will
not smoke, and he says nothing to anybody: there are ninety- nine
chances that he will smoke. Now the second person decides that he will
not smoke and he goes and tells everybody – to ali the friends, to all
the society, he goes and says that he has decided not to smoke. There
are ninety percent chances that he will still smoke.</p><p><br></p><p>First there were ninety-nine chances that he would smoke; now there
are ninety chances that he will still smoke, but there is nine percent
less possibility.</p><p><br></p><p>The third possibility is that he joins a society of non-smokers where
nobody smokes. Now there are ninety-nine percent chances that he will
not smoke.</p><p><br></p><p>Gurdjieff used to say that if you want to do something, find a few
friends so that you can do it together.</p><p><br></p><p>It is almost as if you are imprisoned in a gaol: you want to escape,
but to escape alone will be very difficult. If you make a gang the
possibility is more: you can kill the guard – alone it will be very
difficult; you can break the wall – alone it will be very difficult. But
still there is a possibility you may not be able to succeed, because
your gang will be a small gang of prisoners, helpless prisoners. The
forces who manage the gaol are bigger than you.</p><p><br></p><p>The third thing, the best thing, is make contact with people who are
outside, who are already free, who are not in the gaol, who can supply
things to you, who can manage, who can give you the map, who can bribe
the guards, who can take the gaoler away for a picnic, who can manage a
thousand and one things.</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas has nothing to do with orange<span class=s4></span>you will
have to wear orange. But sannyas has nothing</p><p>to do with orange: it is just a declaration, a gesture, that you are
not alone, that you are part of my family.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a gesture that you are ready to stake your life with me, that
you are ready to gamble. It is a gamble – who knows? I may be wrong. Who
knows? I may not really be out of the gaol, maybe I am just
pretending... I may be the gaoler himself! Nobody can ever be certain
about it. So it is a gamble, it is a trust. Trust is always a
gamble.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I was reading – it has come to light only within
these last ten or twelve years – that if somebody has taken LSD and is
high on it, turned on, sometimes it happens that if you love the person
and you just sit by his side, you turn on. Now, you have not taken LSD,
but if you love the person something telepathic happens, something
communicates with your inner being.</p><p><br></p><p>His state of being turned on, somehow becomes an opening to you – if
you love the person. If you are in a communion with the person, you
suddenly feel that you are on the LSD-trip yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>This has happened only within ten, fifteen years since drugs became
so available to the new generation, but in the east we have always known
it. And exactly the same is the situation with spirituality – more
so.</p><p><br></p><p>A man is turned on: we call him the master. Just being in tune with
him, suddenly your lives are turned on.</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas is just to fall in tune with me. These are outward gestures
of falling in tune with me. They simply show that you are ready – for
the inner you are ready, and you are even ready for the outer. If the
master says to go and dance naked in the streets, the disciple dances.
Not that this nakedness is going to help in any way, but the gesture
that he follows the master.…</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho recounts the tale of Ibrahim, a Mohammedan king, whose task,
before being initiated by a mystic, was to dance naked in the streets of
his own kingdom, beating his head with a shoe.</p><p><br></p><p>He followed the master’s order without demurring and returned a
transformed being.<span class=s4></span>]</p><p><br></p><p>So these things are just gestures. Not that by wearing orange you
will become enlightened, not that by becoming naked or beating your head
with the shoe you will become enlightened, but these are gestures of
falling in tune with me. Even if I say something which has no logic in
it.<span class=s4></span>Why not green,</p><p>why not white, why not blue? No logic in it – it is illogical.</p><p><br></p><p>I could have chosen green, but that would have been the same. I had
to choose some colour – but this is just a gesture to make you part of a
family, to make you part of me, so you become associated with me, so
your responsibilities are my responsibilities, so we are staked
together, so our commitment is together.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to think, think about it. But the better course is to
jump without thinking – and the benefit will be far more. But if you
feel like thinking, you can think for a few days.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin couple speak to Osho. The woman says she has difficulty
adjusting to rest and work hours in her work and relationship.]</p><p><br></p><p>My feeling is that if your body rhythm does not like getting up late
in the morning and going late to bed, then it is better to follow the
body rhythm. Otherwise you will become irritated, and you will start
taking revenge on him [the boyfriend]. It will be very unconscious
revenge and that will destroy the whole beauty of the relationship. He
will not even be able to know why you are getting irritated, why you
said certain things. Because the body rhythm is very very important to
understand. And it cannot be changed, that is one thing about it – there
is no way to change the body rhythm. It settles the moment you are
born.<span class=s4></span>You will never be able to change it.</p><p><br></p><p>[She answers: I don’t know why I do this... not allow myself to have
enough sleep – I think I must do this thing and this thing... especially
things that you have given me.]</p><p><br></p><p>No, no – nothing. I give you this work: to sleep as much as you
can... Now there is no problem; you have to follow my instructions.</p><p><br></p><p>So now this is work and you have to do it!</p><p><br></p><p>So just watch your rhythm. If you feel like going to bed early, then
go early and get up early in the morning. And once you have understood
what time suits you, it is better to be regular about it. If it is
possible, then be regular; if sometimes it is not possible then it’s
okay, but don’t make irregularity a normal routine.</p><p><br></p><p>And the body rhythm is more important than you are aware of. It
creates many difficulties in relationship. People start trying to adjust
to each other – rather than adjusting to their body rhythms, they start
to adjust with each other, naturally. The wife thinks to adjust with the
husband, the husband thinks to adjust with the wife – but this
adjustment is impossible. So sooner or later they start taking revenge,
and that is very unconscious. Small things can destroy beautiful things;
very small things, not very big, just very small things can destroy.</p><p><br></p><p>So just listen to your body, and then adjust the relationship
according to the body rather than adjusting the body according to the
relationship. If it is difficult, if [he] feels to go to bed late, he
can go. Mm? then see him in the day, meet him in the day. If it is not
possible in the night, then let it be day. But first... and he has not
to be forced either, mm? otherwise the other extreme can happen, that he
has to go early with you and he has to get up early. That will disturb
him.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is something, that whatsoever you do, there is no way to
change the rhythm. The rhythm is a fixed thing It gets into your system
the day you are born and it leaves you only the day you die.</p><p><br></p><p>Now much research has been done on body rhythm, and there seems to be
no possibility to change it. It is something in the very cells; the
cells are programmed. And it is beyond the conscious control. You can
force – one can force oneself to be awake or go to sleep and take a
tranquiliser and force sleep – but you cannot change the inner structure
of the cell, it is there.</p><p><br></p><p>Many experiments have been done on animals and on birds. There are
birds who fall asleep as the sun sets. So this has been the
understanding, that it is the sun: when the sun sets they feel that the
darkness has come, they fall asleep. So they were put in artificial
chambers and deceived. When it was night outside there was light in the
chamber, and when it was day outside there was night in the chamber.
They were there for months together. They became neurotic birds – they
started committing suicide or killing each other – but the body rhythm
could not be changed.</p><p><br></p><p>They would fall asleep while it was day in the chamber and they would
become awake when it was night in the chamber. And of course it was very
strange for their bodies to be awake in the night – they started feeling
something eerie, something weird, and that started telling on their
systems, and they became very irritated.</p><p><br></p><p>Many things happen when an animal becomes irritated, his sexuality
becomes perverted. Animals become homosexual when their body is too
irritated, or they start masturbating. Ordinarily they</p><p><br></p><p>are never mad, but they start becoming mad. Ordinarily birds never
commit suicide, but in those chambers they tried to commit suicide; the
whole thing became too heavy. And it was a simple thing, they just had
to adjust their body rhythm – but what could they do? It is impossible,
unless some day in the future they can change the very programme of the
cell. It is not possible before that, and one should not try.</p><p><br></p><p>So simply follow your own rhythms – there is no obligation to adjust
with the other – and then you will feel more loving. In fact, love gives
freedom to the other to be the way he is – the way he feels happy, the
way he feels blissful. Love gives freedom; it never forces the other to
adjust to a certain artificial structure. Even if you cannot see each
other as much, it is good, nothing wrong. Even seeing each other for a
few hours is very good, but giving freedom to each other to be
themselves is important.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part16>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

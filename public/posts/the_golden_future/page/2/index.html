--</p><p>AN ABSENCE OF NOISES. BUT YOU WERE SAYING IT HAD POSITIVE</p><p>QUALITIES, A POSITIVE SOUND. AND IN MY MEDITATIONS, I'VE NOTICED</p><p>THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A SILENCE IN MY BODY AND A SILENCE IN</p><p>MY MIND. I CAN HAVE THE FIRST, WITHOUT THE SECOND. BELOVED MASTER,
PLEASE TALK TO ME ABOUT SILENCE.</p><p>Anand Somen, silence usually is understood to be something negative,
something empty, an absence of sound, of noises. This misunderstanding
is prevalent because very few people have ever experienced silence. All
that they have experienced in the name of silence is noiselessness. But
silence is a totally different phenomenon. It is utterly positive. It is
existential, it is not empty. It is overflowing with a music that you
have never heard before, with a fragrance that is unfamiliar to you,
with a light that can only be seen by the inner eyes. It is not
something fictitious; it is a reality, and a reality which is already
present in everyone -- just we never look in. All our senses are
extrovert. Our eyes open outside, our ears open outside, our hands move
outside, our legs... all our senses are meant to explore the outside
world.</p><p>But there is a sixth sense also, which is asleep because we have
never used it. And no society, no culture, no educational system helps
people to make the sixth sense active.</p><p>That sixth sense, in the East, is called "the third eye." It looks
inwards. And just as there is a way of looking in, so there is a way of
hearing in, so there is a way</p><p>of smelling in.</p><p>Just as there are five senses moving outward, there are five
counter-senses moving inward. In all, man has ten senses, but the first
sense that starts the inner journey is the third eye, and then other
senses start opening up.</p><p>Your inner world has its own taste, has its own fragrance, has its
own light. And it is utterly silent, immensely silent, eternally silent.
There has never been any noise, and there will never be any noise. No
word can reach there, but you can reach. The mind cannot reach there,
but you can reach because you are not the mind. The function of the mind
is again to be a bridge between you and the objective world, and the
function of the heart is to be a bridge between you and yourself.</p><p>The silence that I have been talking about is the silence of the
heart. It is a song in itself, without words and without sounds. It is
only out of this silence that the flowers of love grow. It is this
silence that becomes the garden of Eden. Meditation, and only
meditation, is the key to open the doors of your own being.</p><p>You are asking, "A while ago you said something about silence which
startled me in my sleepiness. I had simply thought of it as just an
absence -- an absence of noises. But you were saying it had positive
qualities, a positive sound. And in my meditations, I have noticed a
distinction between a silence in my body and a silence in my mind."</p><p>Your experiences are true. The body knows its own silence -- that is
its own well-being, its own overflowing health, its own joy. The mind
also knows its silence, when all thoughts disappear and the sky is
without any clouds, just a pure space. But the silence I am talking
about is far deeper.</p><p>I am talking about the silence of your being.</p><p>These silences that you are talking about can be disturbed. Sickness
can disturb the silence of your body, and death is certainly going to
disturb it. A single thought can disturb the silence of your mind, the
way a small pebble thrown into the silent lake is enough to create
thousands of ripples, and the lake is no longer silent. The silence of
the body and the mind are very fragile and very superficial, but in
themselves they are good.</p><p>To experience them is helpful, because it indicates that there may be
even deeper</p><p>silences of the heart.</p><p>And the day you experience the silence of the heart, it will be again
an arrow of longing, moving you even deeper.</p><p>Your very center of being is the center of a cyclone. Whatever
happens around it does not affect it; it is eternal silence. Days come
and go, years come and go, ages come and pass, lives come and go, but
the eternal silence of your being remains exactly the same -- the same
soundless music, the same fragrance of godliness, the same transcendence
from all that is mortal, from all that is momentary.</p><p>It is not your silence. You are it.</p><p>It is not something in your possession; you are possessed by it, and
that's the greatness of it. Even you are not there, because even your
presence will be a disturbance.</p><p>The silence is so profound that there is nobody, not even you. And
this silence brings truth, and love, and thousands of other blessings to
you. This is the search, this is the longing of all the hearts, of all
those who have a little intelligence.</p><p>But remember, don't get lost in the silence of the body, or the
silence of the mind, or even the silence of the heart. Beyond these
three is the fourth. We, in the East, have called it simply "the
fourth," turiya. We have not given it any name. Instead of a name we
have given it a number, because it comes after three silences -- of the
body, of the mind, of the heart -- and beyond it, there is nothing else
to be found.</p><p>So, don't misunderstand. Most of the people... for example, there are
people who are practicing yoga exercises. Yoga exercises give a silence
of the body, and they are stuck there. Their whole life, they practice,
but they know only the most superficial silence.</p><p>Then there are people who are doing concentrations like
transcendental meditation, of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. It can give you a
silence which will be only of the mind. Just by repeating a name or a
mantra... the very repetition</p><p>creates in its wake, a silence in the mind. But it is not meditation,
and it is not transcendental.</p><p>And there are Sufis who know the third, which is the deepest of the
three. But still it is not the goal, the target; your arrow is still
falling short. It is very deep because Sufis know the heart more than
anybody else. For centuries they have been working on the heart, just as
yogis have been working on the body, and people of concentration and
contemplation have been working on the mind.</p><p>The Sufis know the immense beauty of love. They radiate love, but
still the home has not been reached. You have to remember the fourth.
Unless you reach the fourth, continue the journey.</p><p>People misunderstand very easily. Just a little bit of experience and
they think they have arrived. And mind is very clever to
rationalize.</p><p>There is a Sufi story about Mulla Nasruddin. The Mulla hears a
commotion in the street outside his house in the middle of the night.
His wife tells him to go down, and after many arguments he puts a
blanket on his shoulders and goes down to the street. There were many
people in the street and a lot of noise, and in the crowd somebody
steals his blanket.</p><p>The Mulla goes home naked, and his wife asks him, "What was that all
about?" The Mulla says, "It seems to be about my blanket, because as
they got the blanket they all disappeared. They were just waiting for
the blanket. And I was telling yoùDon't force me to go there.' Now I
have lost my blanket and I have come naked. It was none of our
business."</p><p>He has found a rationalization, and it looks logical, that as they
got his blanket they all disappeared. And the poor Mulla thinking that
perhaps that was the whole problem.…</p><p>"Their argument and their noise just in front of my house in the
middle of the night, and my foolish wife persuaded me finally to lose my
blanket!"</p><p>Mind is continuously rationalizing, and sometimes it may appear that
what it is saying is right, because it gives arguments for it. But one
has to beware of one's own mind, because in this world nobody can cheat
you more than your own mind. Your greatest enemy is within you, just as
your greatest friend is also within you.</p><p>The greatest enemy is just your first encounter, and your greatest
friend is going to be your last encounter -- so don't be prevented by
any experience of the body or the mind or the heart. Remember always one
of the famous statements of Gautam Buddha. He used to conclude his
sermons every day with the same two words, charaiveti, charaiveti."
Those two simple words -- just one word repeated twice -- means "Don't
stop; go on, go on."</p><p>Never stop until the road ends, until there is nowhere else to go --
charaiveti, charaiveti.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IS IT REALLY WORTH PUTTING ANY ENERGY INTO IMPROVING MY
PERSONALITY?</p><p>Anand Tarika, have you ever heard me? I have been constantly telling
you that the personality has to be dropped so that your individuality
can be discovered. I have been insisting that the personality is not
you; it is a mask people have put over you. It is not your authentic
reality, it is not your original face. And you are asking me, "Is it
really worth putting any energy into improving my personality?"</p><p>Put your energy into destroying your personality. Put your energy
into discovering your individuality. And make the distinction very
clear: individuality is that which you have brought from your very
birth. Individuality is your essential being, and personality is what
the society has made of you, what they wanted to make of you.</p><p>No society up to now has been able to give freedom to their children
to be themselves. It seems risky. They may prove rebellious. They may
not follow the religion of their forefathers; they may not think the
great politicians are really great; they may not trust in your moral
values. They will find their own morality, and they will find their own
lifestyle. They will not be replicas, they will not repeat the past;
they will be beings of the future.</p><p>This has created fear that they may go astray. Before they go astray,
every society tries to give them a certain direction how to live, a
certain ideology of</p><p>what is good and what is evil, a certain religion, a certain holy
scripture. These are ways to create the personality, and the personality
functions like an imprisonment. You are asking me, Tarika, that you want
to improve this personality. Are you your own enemy?</p><p>But this is not only you. Millions of people in the world know only
their personality; they don't know that there is anything more than
personality. They have completely forgotten themselves, and they have
forgotten even the way to reach themselves. They have all become actors,
hypocrites. They have become puppets in the hands of the priests, of the
politicians, of the parents; they are doing things which they never want
to do and they are not doing things which they are hankering to do.</p><p>Their life is split in such a diametrically opposite way that they
can never be at peace.</p><p>Their nature will assert itself again and again, will not leave them
at peace. And their so-called personality will go on repressing it,
forcing it deeper into the unconscious. This conflict divides you and
your energy -- and a house divided cannot stand long. This is the whole
misery of human beings -- why there is not much dance, much song, much
joyfulness.</p><p>People are so much engaged in warfare with themselves. They don't
have energy, and they don't have time to do anything else except fight
with themselves. Their sensuality they have to fight, their sexuality
they have to fight, their individuality they have to fight, their
originality they have to fight. And they have to fight for something
which they don't want to be, which is not part of their nature, which is
not their destiny. So they can pretend to be false for a time -- again
the real asserts.</p><p>Their whole life goes on, up and down, and they cannot figure out who
really they are: the repressor or the repressed? the oppressor or the
oppressed? And whatever they do, they cannot destroy their nature. They
can certainly poison it; they can certainly destroy its joy, they can
destroy its dance, they can destroy its love. They can make their life a
mess, but they cannot destroy their nature completely. And they cannot
throw away their personality, because their personality carries their
forefathers, their parents, their teachers, their priests, their whole
past. It is their heritage; they cling to it.</p><p>My whole teaching is, don't cling to personality. It is not yours,
and it is never going to be yours. Allow your nature full freedom. And
respect yourself, be proud of being yourself, whatever you are. Have
some dignity! Don't be destroyed by the dead.</p><p>People who have been dead for thousands of years are sitting on your
head. They are your personality -- and you want to improve on them? So
call a few more dead! Graves have to be searched for... bring out more
skeletons, surround yourself with all kinds of skeletons. You will be
respected by the society. You will be honored, rewarded; you will have
great prestige, you will be thought to be a saint. But living with the
dead, surrounded by the dead, you will not be able to laugh -- it will
be so out of place -- you will not be able to dance, you will not be
able to sing, you will not be able to love.</p><p>Personality is a dead thing. Drop it! -- in a single blow, not in
fragments, not slowly, today a little bit and then tomorrow a little
bit, because life is short and tomorrow is not certain.</p><p>The false is false. Discard it totally!</p><p>Every real human being has to be a rebel... rebel against whom? --
against his own personality.</p><p>The Japanese-American was a long-time customer at this Greek
restaurant, because he had discovered that they made specially tasty
fried rice. Each evening he would come in the restaurant, and he would
order "flied lice." This always caused the Greek restaurant owner to
nearly roll on the floor with laughter. Sometimes he would have two or
three friends stand nearby just to hear the Japanese customer order his
"flied lice."</p><p>Eventually the customer's pride was so hurt that he took a special
diction lesson just to be able to say "fried rice" correctly. The next
time he went to the restaurant he said very plainly, "Fried rice,
please."</p><p>Unable to believe his ears, the Greek restaurant owner said, "Sir,
would you repeat that?"</p><p>The Japanese-American replied, "You heard what I said, you flucking
Gleek!" How long can you go on pretending? The reality is going to come
up some day</p><p>or other, and it is better that it comes sooner.</p><p>There is no need, Tarika, to improve your diction! Just drop that
whole personality thing.</p><p>Just be yourself. Howsoever raw and howsoever wild it appears to be
in the beginning, soon it starts having its own grace, its own
beauty.</p><p>And the personality... you can go on polishing it, but it is just
polishing a dead thing which is going to destroy not only your time,
your energy, your life, but also the people who are around you.</p><p>We are all affecting each other. When everybody is doing something,
you also start doing it. Life is very contagious; everybody is improving
his personality -- that's why the idea has arisen in your mind.</p><p>But my people are not doing that. My people are not a herd, not a
mob. They are respectful of themselves, and they are respectful of
others. They are proud of their freedom and they want everybody else to
be free, because their freedom has given them so much love and so much
grace. They would like everybody else in the world to be free, loving
and graceful.</p><p>This is possible only if you are original -- not something put
together, not something false, but something that grows within you,
which has roots in your being, which brings flowers in its time. And to
have one's own flowers is the only destiny, is the only significant way
of life.</p><p>But the personality has no roots; it is plastic, it is phony.
Dropping it is not difficult; it needs just a little courage. And my
feeling of thousands of people is that everybody has that much courage,
just people are not using it. Once you start using your courage, sources
which are dormant become active, and you become capable of having more
courage, of more rebelliousness.</p><p>You become a revolution in yourself.</p><p>A man who is a revolution unto himself is a joy to see, because he
has fulfilled his destiny. He has transcended the ordinary mob, the
sleeping crowd.</p><p>Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IN THESE DAYS I FEEL A LITTLE PLANT GROWING INSIDE OF ME, WHICH
IS</p><p>STILL VERY DELICATE AND FRAGILE. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO TAKE</p><p>IMMENSE CARE OF THIS LITTLE FLOWER JUST STARTING TO OPEN, NOT TO</p><p>WATER IT TOO MUCH, NOR TOO LITTLE, NOR TO EXPOSE IT TOO MUCH TO</p><p>THE WIND. MY BELOVED OSHO, PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO TAKE CARE OF</p><p>THIS LITTLE PLANT, SINCE IN THIS MOMENT IT WOULD STILL BE VERY</p><p>EASY FOR ME TO DESTROY IT.</p><p>Deva Premal, it is good news that you are feeling a little plant
growing inside you.</p><p>Naturally it will be, in the beginning, very delicate and very
fragile. And your feeling is right, that you "have to take immense care
of this little flower just starting to open, not to water it too much,
nor too little, nor to expose it too much to the wind."</p><p>All that is needed are three things.</p><p>When your consciousness starts growing, you need more meditation. And
there is no limit to meditation, so you need not be worried that
meditation can be too much and can kill the flower. Meditation is always
too little, because there is always too much ahead of you, and
meditation will make the fragile and delicate flower more and more
strong.</p><p>You need a silent being.</p><p>Caring too much can be dangerous, it can become an anxiety. Being
worried too</p><p>much that you should water less or you should water more, that you
may expose it to the winds, to the sun, to the rain too much or too
little... caring can become a tremendous turmoil in your being, and your
very caring can destroy the flower. Instead of caring, you need a more
silent, more conscious, more peaceful being, which will give a strength
to something new that is growing in you.</p><p>Secondly, care is not enough; love is needed. Care is more a
technical word; love is totally different. Care needs a certain
education. Care is just like a nurse who knows what has to be done, what
is right to be done -- but there is no love in her heart, she functions
technically.</p><p>Love is more like a mother, who may not know the art of nursing, but
she need not know.</p><p>Love is enough unto itself. Love is a mysterious phenomenon; it knows
what is needed. It simply knows without any education.</p><p>So what you need is meditation, love, and the third thing -- which
you may not have thought of at all -- a joyous life, because all that is
great in you only grows when joy is showering on it. It grows only when
you are in a space of blissfulness, when there is laughter, there is
song and there is dance.</p><p>And I know perfectly your fear. You say, "Please tell me how to take
care of this little plant." I will not say how to take care, because I
don't want you to become a nurse. I want you to become a mother. I want
you to be love, not technical knowledge, because these flowers don't
need technical knowledge.</p><p>You are afraid, "since in this moment, it would still be very easy
for me to destroy it."</p><p>That danger is very real. When something inside you grows it brings
new responsibilities, because now you need more meditation, you need
more love, you need more joy.</p><p>This flower inside you can become a burden to you if you don't
understand the language of meditation, the language of love, the
language of blissfulness. You can destroy the flower by your own hands,
just to get rid of the responsibility. But this flower is not only
responsibility: it is also your growth, your maturity.</p><p>This flower is not something separate from you.</p><p>It is your own being.</p><p>To destroy it means to commit suicide.</p><p>But your question is more concerned about the technicalities of care,
and I would like you to change the focus.</p><p>Inner growth does not need any technical knowledge, any technical
expertise. All that it needs is very simple and very joyful, and it is
not a burden. Meditation will make you lighter, less loaded with all
kinds of rubbish. Love will also give you new skies, new freedoms.
Blissfulness will give you wings to move into those new skies and new
spaces.</p><p>But the question carries the implication that for centuries in the
West the mind has become technically oriented. It has created great
technology, great science, but it has destroyed man completely. The
house is full of all kinds of gadgets, just the master of the house has
disappeared, is lost in the gadgets.</p><p>The East has never been technically oriented; it is more concerned
with values than with techniques. For example, in the East if somebody
is sick, then the wife will not be ready for her husband or her lover to
be taken care of by a nurse. It simply will not come to her mind. This
is the time when she is needed, and if love cannot heal, then no other
technique is going to heal. It is not a question of expertise.</p><p>In the West the same situation will have a totally different
response. The wife or the husband would like to call a nurse to take
care. And he seems, or she seems, to be more logical because the nurse
is trained in taking care; She knows the know-how.</p><p>But in the East it is almost inconceivable that love can be replaced
by expertise of any kind. Expertise can be called in only when there is
no love, when the wife feels it is a burden and it is a good chance to
get rid of this fellow... call a nurse. And she has good reason; every
logic is in her support. The doctor will support her, that this is a
very loving decision. But the reality is just the opposite; it is not a
loving decision.</p><p>So don't ask me about how to take care. Ask me how to be more
meditative, how to be more loving, how to be more joyful, because that
which is growing within you needs nourishment -- and your meditation
will give it nourishment, your joy</p><p>will give it warmth, your love will give it dignity.</p><p>A man, narrowly reared by a widowed mother, got married. He
telephoned back to his mother from the honeymoon hotel to say that he
knew there was something he had to do in bed, but he did not know what
it was.</p><p>"Why," said his mother, "you put your... eh, that is, you put the
hardest part of yourself in the place where your wife wee-wees."</p><p>At midnight the hotel rang the fire brigade for help. "We have got a
young man with his head jammed in a chamber pot."</p><p>Avoid technical knowledge! Question 4</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>HOW COME I HAVE ALWAYS FELT, EVER SINCE CHILDHOOD, THAT I AM</p><p>MORE THAN TWO PEOPLE? COULD YOU SAY SOMETHING PLEASE?</p><p>Prem Prabhati, everybody is born as one single individual, but by the
time he is mature enough to participate in life he has become a crowd.
It is not anything special that you are feeling; it is almost the case
with everybody. The only difference is that you are becoming aware of
it, which is good. People are not aware of it.</p><p>If you just sit silently and listen to your mind, you will find so
many voices. You will be surprised, you can recognize those voices very
well. Some voice is from your grandfather, some voice is from your
grandmother, some voice is from your father, some voice is from your
mother, some voice is from the priest, from the teacher, from the
neighbors, from your friends, from your enemies. All these voices are
jumbled up in a crowd within you, and if you want to find your own
voice, it is almost impossible; the crowd is too thick.</p><p>In fact, you have forgotten your own voice long before. You were
never given freedom enough to voice your opinions. You were always
taught obedience. You were taught to say yes to everything that your
elders were saying to you. You</p><p>were taught that you have to follow whatever your teachers or your
priests are doing. Nobody ever told you to search for your own voice --
"Have you got any voice of your own or not?"</p><p>So your voice has remained very subdued and other voices are very
loud, very commanding, because they were orders and you had followed
them -- in spite of yourself.</p><p>You had no intention to follow, you could see that this is not right.
But one has to be obedient to be respected, to be acceptable, to be
loved.</p><p>Naturally only one voice is missing in you, only one person is
missing in you, and that is you; otherwise there is a whole crowd. And
that crowd is constantly driving you mad, because one voice says, "Do
this," another voice says, "Never do that! Don't listen to that voice!"
And you are torn apart.</p><p>This whole crowd has to be withdrawn. This whole crowd has to be
told, "Now please leave me alone!" The people who have gone to the
mountains or to the secluded forests were really not going away from the
society; they were trying to find a place where they can disperse their
crowd inside. And those people who have made a place within you are
obviously reluctant to leave.</p><p>But if you want to become an individual in your own right, if you
want to get rid of this continuous conflict and this mess within you,
then you have to say goodbye to them --</p><p>even when they belong to your respected father, your mother, your
grandfather. It does not matter to whom they belong. One thing is
certain: they are not your voices. They are the voices of people who
have lived in their time, and they had no idea what the future was going
to be. They have loaded their children with their own experience; their
experience is not going to match with the unknown future.</p><p>They are thinking they are helping their children to be
knowledgeable, to be wise, so their life can be easier and more
comfortable, but they are doing just the wrong thing. With all the good
intentions in the world, they are destroying the child's spontaneity,
his own consciousness, his own ability to stand on his feet, and to
respond to the new future which their old ancestors had no idea of.</p><p>He is going to face new storms, he is going to face new situations,
and he needs</p><p>a totally new consciousness to respond. Only then is his response is
going to be fruitful; only then can he can have a victorious life, a
life that is not just a long, long drawn-out despair, but a dance from
moment to moment, which goes on becoming more and more deep to the last
breath. He enters into death dancing, and joyously.</p><p>Prabhati, it is good that you are becoming aware that it seems you
are more than one person. Everybody is! And by becoming aware, it is
possible to get rid of this crowd.</p><p>Be silent, and find your own self.</p><p>Unless you find your own self, it is very difficult to disperse the
crowd, because all those in the crowd are pretending, "I am your self."
And you have no way to agree, or disagree.</p><p>So don't create any fight with the crowd. Let them fight amongst
themselves -- they are quite efficient in fighting amongst themselves.
You, meanwhile, try to find yourself. And once you know who you are, you
can just order them to get out of the house -- it is actually that
simple! But first you have to find yourself.</p><p>Once you are there, the master is there, the owner of the house is
there. And all these people, who have been pretending to be masters
themselves, start dispersing. A man who is not a crowd is truly the
"superman" of which we have been talking as Zarathustra's great
hope.</p><p>The man who is himself, unburdened of the past, discontinuous with
the past, original, strong as a lion and innocent as a child... he can
reach to the stars, or even beyond the stars; his future is golden.</p><p>Up to now people have always been talking about the golden past. My
people have to learn the language of the golden future.</p><p>There is no need for you to change the whole world; just change
yourself and you have started changing the whole world, because you are
part of the world. If even a single human being changes, his change will
radiate in thousands and thousands of others. He will become a
triggering point for a revolution which can give birth to the
superman.</p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p>The Golden Future Chapter #2</p><p> </p><div class=toc><p><a href=part1 class=toc0>Chapter title: Peaks beyond peaks

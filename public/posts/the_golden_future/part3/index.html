YET IT SEEMS AS IF FROM THE DAY WE ARE BORN, WHATEVER WE ARE DOING, WHOEVER WE ARE, WE SEEK TO RELATE TO\nOTHERS; IN ADDITION, WE ARE USUALLY ATTRACTED TO BEING INTIMATE\nWITH ONE PERSON IN PARTICULAR. WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?\nDhyan Amiyo, the question that you have asked is the question of every human being.\nWe are born alone, we live alone, and we die alone. Aloneness is our very nature, but we are not aware of it. Because we are not aware of it, we remain strangers to ourselves, and instead of seeing our aloneness as a tremendous beauty and bliss, silence and peace, at-easeness with existence, we misunderstand it as loneliness.\nLoneliness is a misunderstood aloneness. Once you misunderstand your aloneness as loneliness, the whole context changes. Aloneness has a beauty and grandeur, a positivity; loneliness is poor, negative, dark, dismal.\nEverybody is running away from loneliness. It is like a wound; it hurts. To escape from it, the only way is to be in a crowd, to become part of a society, to have friends, to create a family, to have husbands and wives, to have children. In this crowd, the basic effort is that you will be able to forget your loneliness.\nBut nobody has ever succeeded in forgetting it. That which is natural to you, you can try to ignore -- but you cannot forget it; it will assert again and again. And the problem becomes more complex because you have never seen it as it is; you have taken it for granted that you are born lonely.\nThe dictionary meaning is the same; that shows the mind of the people who create dictionaries. They don't understand at all the vast difference between loneliness and aloneness. Loneliness is a gap. Something is missing, something is needed to fill it, and nothing can ever fill it because it is a misunderstanding in the first place. As you grow older, the gap also grows bigger. People are so afraid to be by themselves that they do any kind of stupid thing. I have seen people playing cards alone; the other party is not there. They have invented games in which the same person plays cards from both sides.\nSomehow one wants to remain engaged. That engagement may be with people, may be with work.… There are workaholics; they are afraid when the weekend\ncomes close --\nwhat are they going to do? And if they don't do anything, they are left to themselves, and that is the most painful experience.\nYou will be surprised to know that it is on the weekends that most of the accidents in the world happen. People are rushing in their cars to resort places, to sea beaches, to hill stations, bumper to bumper. It may take eight hours, ten hours to reach, and there is nothing for them to do because the whole crowd has come with them. Now their house, their neighborhood, their city is more peaceful than this sea resort. Everybody has come.\nBut some engagement.…\nPeople are playing cards, chess; people are watching television for hours. The average American watches television five hours a day; people are listening to the radio... just to avoid themselves. For all these activities, the only reason is -- not to be left alone; it is very fearful. And this idea is taken from others. Who has told you that to be alone is a fearful state?\nThose who have known aloneness say something absolutely different. They say there is nothing more beautiful, more peaceful, more joyful than being alone.\nBut you listen to the crowd. The people who live in misunderstanding are in such a majority, that who bothers about a Zarathustra, or a Gautam Buddha? These single individuals can be wrong, can be hallucinating, can be deceiving themselves or deceiving you, but millions of people cannot be wrong. And millions of people agree that to be left to oneself is the worst experience in life; it is hell.\nBut any relationship that is created because of the fear, because of the inner hell of being left alone, cannot be satisfying. Its very root is poisoned. You don't love your woman, you are simply using her not to be lonely; neither does she love you. She is also in the same paranoia; she is using you not to be left alone.\nNaturally, in the name of love anything may happen -- except love. Fights may happen, arguments may happen, but even they are preferred to being lonely: at least somebody is there and you are engaged, you can forget your loneliness. But love is not possible, because there is no basic foundation for love.\nLove never grows out of fear.\nYou are asking, \"You said the other day that we are born alone, we live alone and we die alone. Yet it seems as if from the day we are born, whatever we are doing, whoever we are, we seek to relate to others.\"\nThis seeking to relate to others is nothing but escapism. Even the smallest baby tries to find something to do; if nothing else, then he will suck his own big toes on his feet. It is an absolutely futile activity, nothing can come out of it, but it is engagement. He is doing something. You will see in the stations, in the airports, small boys and girls carrying their teddy bears; they cannot sleep without them. Darkness makes their loneliness even more dangerous. The teddy bear is a great protection; somebody is with them.\nAnd your God is nothing but a teddy bear for grown-ups.\nYou cannot live as you are. Your relationships are not relationships. They are ugly. You are using the other person, and you know perfectly well the other person is using you.\nAnd to use anybody is to reduce him into a thing, into a commodity. You don't have any respect for the person.\n\"In addition,\" you are asking, \"we are usually attracted to being intimate with one person in particular.\"\nIt has a psychological reason. You are brought up by a mother, by a father; if you are a boy, you start loving your mother and you start being jealous of your father because he is a competitor; if you are a girl, you start loving your father and you hate your mother because she is a competitor. These are now established facts, not hypotheses, and the result of it turns your whole life into a misery. The boy carries the image of his mother as the model of a woman. He becomes conditioned continuously; he knows only one woman so closely, so intimately. Her face, her hair, her warmth -- everything becomes an imprint. That's exactly the scientific word used: it becomes an imprint in his psychology.\nAnd the same happens to the girl about the father.\nWhen you grow up, you fall in love with some woman or with some man and you think,\n\"Perhaps we are made for each other.\" Nobody is made for anyone. But why do you feel attracted towards one certain person? It is because of your imprint. He must resemble your father in some way; she must resemble your mother in some way.\nOf course no other woman can be exactly a replica of your mother, and anyway you are not in search of a mother, you are in search of a wife. But the imprint inside you decides who is the right woman for you. The moment you see that woman, there is no question of reasoning. You immediately feel attraction; your imprint immediately starts functioning -\n- this is the woman for you, or this is the man for you.\nIt is good as far as meeting once in a while on the sea beach, in the movie hall, in the garden is concerned, because you don't come to know each other totally. But you are both hankering to live together; you want to be married, and that is one of the most dangerous steps that lovers can take.\nThe moment you are married, you start becoming aware of the totality of the other person, and you are surprised on every single aspect -- \"Something went wrong; this is not the woman, this is not the man\" -- because they don't fit with the ideal that you are carrying within you. And the trouble is multiplied because the woman is carrying an ideal of her father -- you don't fit with it. You are carrying the ideal of your mother -- she does not fit with it. That's why all marriages are failures.\nOnly very rare marriages are not failures -- and I hope God should save you from those marriages which are not failures, because they are psychologically sick. There are people who are sadists, who enjoy torturing others, and there are people who are masochists, who enjoy torturing themselves. If a husband and wife belong to these two categories, that marriage will be a successful marriage. One is a masochist and one is a sadist -- it is a perfect marriage, because one enjoys being tortured and one enjoys torturing.\nBut ordinarily it is very difficult to find out in the first place whether you are a masochist or a sadist, and then to look for your other polarity.… If you are wise enough you should go to the psychologist and enquire who you are, a masochist or a sadist? and ask if he can give you some references which can fit with you.\nSometimes, just by accident, it happens that a sadist and masochist become\nmarried. They are the happiest people in the world; they are fulfilling each other's needs. But what kind of need is this? -- they are both psychopaths, and they are living a life of torture. But otherwise, every marriage is going to fail, for one simple reason: the imprint is the problem.\nEven in marriage, the basic reason for which you wanted to have the relationship is not fulfilled. You are more alone when you are with your wife than when you are alone. To leave husband and wife in a room by themselves is to make them both utterly miserable.\nOne of my friends was retiring; he was a big industrialist, and he was retiring because of my advice. I said, \"You have so much and you don't have a son; you have two daughters and they are married in rich families. Now why unnecessarily bother about all kinds of worries -- of business, and income tax, and this and that? You can close everything; you have enough. Even if you live one thousand years, it will do.\"\nHe said, \"That's true. The real problem is not the business, the real problem is I will be left alone with my wife. I can retire right now if you promise me one thing, that you will live with us.\nI said, \"This is strange. Are you retiring or am I retiring?\"\nHe said, \"That is the condition. Do you think I am interested in all these troubles? It is just to escape from my wife.\"\nThe wife was a great social worker. She used to run an orphanage, a house for widows, and a hospital particularly for people who are beggars and cannot pay for their treatment.\nI also asked her in the evening, \"Do you really enjoy all this, from the morning till the evening?\"\nShe said, \"Enjoy? It is a kind of austerity, a self-imposed torture.\"\nI said, \"Why should you impose this torture on yourself?\" She said, \"Just to avoid your friend. If we are left alone, that is the worst experience in life.\"\nAnd this is a love marriage, not an arranged marriage. They married each other against the whole family, the whole society, because they belonged to different\nreligions, different castes; but their imprints gave them signals that this is the right woman, this is the right man. And all this happens unconsciously. That's why you cannot answer why you have fallen in love with a certain woman, or with a certain man. It is not a conscious decision. It has been decided by your unconscious imprint.\nAmiyo, this whole effort -- whether of relationships or remaining busy in a thousand and one things -- is just to escape from the idea that you are lonely. And I want it to be emphatically clear to you that this is where the meditator and the ordinary man part.\nThe ordinary man goes on trying to forget his loneliness, and the meditator starts getting more and more acquainted with his aloneness. He has left the world; he has gone to the caves, to the mountains, to the forest, just for the sake of being alone. He wants to know who he is. In the crowd, it is difficult; there are so many disturbances. And those who have known their aloneness have known the greatest blissfulness possible to human beings -- because your very being is blissful.\nAfter being in tune with your aloneness, you can relate; then your relationship will bring great joys to you, because it is not out of fear. Finding your aloneness you can create, you can be involved in as many things as you want, because this involvement will not anymore be running away from yourself. Now it will be your expression; now it will be the manifestation of all that is your potential.\nOnly such a man -- whether he lives alone or lives in the society, whether he marries or lives unmarried makes no difference -- is always blissful, peaceful, silent. His life is a dance, is a song, is a flowering, is a fragrance. Whatever he does, he brings his fragrance to it.\nBut the first basic thing is to know your aloneness absolutely.\nThis escape from yourself you have learned from the crowd. Because everybody is escaping, you start escaping. Every child is born in a crowd and starts imitating people; what others are doing, he starts doing. He falls into the same miserable situations as others are in, and he starts thinking that this is what life is all about. And he has missed life completely.\nSo I remind you, don't misunderstand aloneness as loneliness. Loneliness is certainly sick; aloneness is perfect health.\nGinsberg visits Doctor Goldberg. \"Ja, you are sick.\" \"Not good enough. I want another opinion.\" \"Okay,\" said Doctor Goldberg, \"you are ugly too.\"\nWe are all committing the same kinds of misunderstandings continually.\nI would like my people to know that your first and most primary step towards finding the meaning and significance of life is to enter into your aloneness. It is your temple; it is where your God lives, and you cannot find this temple anywhere else. You can go on to the moon, to Mars.…\nOnce you have entered your innermost core of being, you cannot believe your own eyes: you were carrying so much joy, so many blessings, so much love... and you were escaping from your own treasures.\nKnowing these treasures and their inexhaustibility, you can move now into relationships, into creativity. You will help people by sharing your love, not by using them. You will give dignity to people by your love; you will not destroy their respect. And you will, without any effort, become a source for them to find their own treasures too. Whatever you make, whatever you do, you will spread your silence, your peace, your blessings into everything possible.\nBut this basic thing is not taught by any family, by any society, by any university. People go on living in misery, and it is taken for granted. Everybody is miserable, so it is nothing much if you are miserable; you cannot be an exception.\nBut I say unto you: You can be an exception. You just have not made the right effort.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHE OTHER DAY, YOU TALKED ABOUT THE THIRD EYE AS A DOOR FOR\nCONNECTING WITH YOU AND EXISTENCE. WHENEVER I FEEL OPEN,\nFLOWING, CONNECTING WITH YOU, OTHER PEOPLE, NATURE OR MYSELF, I MOSTLY FEEL IT IN MY HEART AS SILENCE AND EXPANDING\nSPACIOUSNESS, AND SOMETIMES AS RADIATING LIGHT. BELOVED OSHO, IS THIS THE SAME KIND OF EXPERIENCE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT, OR\nIS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONNECTING THROUGH THE THIRD\nEYE OR THE HEART; OR ARE THERE DIFFERENT STAGES?\nVedant Amod, what you are experiencing is in itself valuable, but it is not the experience of the third eye. The third eye is a little higher than your experience.\nThe way the mystics in the East have categorized the evolution of consciousness is in seven centers. Your experiences belong to the fourth center, the heart. It is one of the most important centers, because it is exactly in the middle. Three centers are below it and three centers are above it. That's why love is such a balancing experience.\nYour description is, \"Whenever I feel open, flowing, connecting with you, other people, nature or myself, I mostly feel it in my heart as silence and expanding spaciousness, and sometimes as radiating light. Is this the same kind of experience you were talking about?\"\nI was talking about the third eye, which is above the heart. There are three centers above the heart. One is in your throat, which is the center of creativity; one is between your two eyebrows, exactly in the middle, which is called the third eye. Just as you have two eyes to know the outside world... the third eye is only a metaphor, but the experience is knowing oneself, seeing oneself.\nThe last center is sahastrara, the seventh; that is at the top of your head. As consciousness goes on moving upwards, first you know yourself, and in the second step you know the whole universe; you know the whole and yourself as part of it.\nIn the old language, the seventh is \"knowing God,\" the sixth is \"knowing yourself,\" the fifth is \"being creative,\" and the fourth is \"being loving, sharing\nand knowing others.\"\nWith the fourth, your journey becomes certain; it can be guaranteed that you will reach the seventh. Before the fourth, there is a possibility you may go astray.\nThe first center is the sex center, which is for reproduction -- so that life continues. Just above it... the sex energy can be moved upwards, and it is a great experience; for the first time you find yourself self-sufficient.\nSex always needs the other. The second center is the center of contentment, self- sufficiency: you are enough unto yourself. At the third center you start exploring\n-- who are you? who is this self-sufficient being? These centers are all significant.…\nThe moment you find who you are, the fourth center opens and you find you are love.\nBefore the fourth the journey has started, but there is a possibility you may not be able to complete it. You can go astray. For example, finding yourself self- sufficient, contented, you can remain there; there is no need to do anything anymore. You may not even ask the question, \"Who am I?\" The sufficiency is so much that all questions disappear.\nA master is needed in these moments, so that you don't settle somewhere in the middle without reaching the goal. And there are beautiful spots to settle... feeling contented, what is the need to go on? But the master goes on nagging you and wants you to know who you are; you may be contented, but at least know who you are. The moment you know who you are, a new door opens, because you become aware of life, of love, of joy. You can stay there; it is so much, there is no need to move any more. But the master goads you on, \"Move to the fourth! Unless you find the purest energy of love, you will not know the splendor of existence.\"\nAfter the fourth, you cannot go astray. Once you have known the splendor of existence, creativity arises on its own. You have known beauty; you would like to create it also.\nYou want to be a creator. A tremendous longing for creativity arises. Whenever you feel love, you always feel creativity just as a shadow coming with it. The man of creativity cannot simply go on looking outside. There is much beauty\noutside... but he becomes aware that just as there is an infinite sky outside, to balance it there must be the same infinity inside.\nIf a master is available, it is good; if he is not available, these experiences will lead you onwards.\nOnce your third eye is opened, and you see yourself, the whole expanse of your consciousness, you have come very close to the temple of God; you are just standing on the steps. You can see the door and you cannot resist the temptation to go inside the temple and see what is there. There you find universal consciousness, there you find enlightenment, there you find ultimate liberation. There you find your eternity.\nSo these are the seven centers -- just arbitrarily created divisions, so the seeker can move from one to another in a systematic way; otherwise, there is every possibility, if you are working by yourself, to get muddled. Particularly before the fourth center there are dangers, and even after the fourth center.…\nThere have been many poets who have lived at the fifth center of creativity and never gone ahead -- many painters, many dancers, many singers who created great art, but never moved to the third eye. And there have been mystics who have remained with the third eye, knowing their own inner beauty; it is so fulfilling that they thought they had arrived.

YET IT SEEMS AS IF FROM THE DAY WE ARE BORN,
WHATEVER WE ARE DOING, WHOEVER WE ARE, WE SEEK TO RELATE TO</p><p>OTHERS; IN ADDITION, WE ARE USUALLY ATTRACTED TO BEING INTIMATE</p><p>WITH ONE PERSON IN PARTICULAR. WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?</p><p>Dhyan Amiyo, the question that you have asked is the question of
every human being.</p><p>We are born alone, we live alone, and we die alone. Aloneness is our
very nature, but we are not aware of it. Because we are not aware of it,
we remain strangers to ourselves, and instead of seeing our aloneness as
a tremendous beauty and bliss, silence and peace, at-easeness with
existence, we misunderstand it as loneliness.</p><p>Loneliness is a misunderstood aloneness. Once you misunderstand your
aloneness as loneliness, the whole context changes. Aloneness has a
beauty and grandeur, a positivity; loneliness is poor, negative, dark,
dismal.</p><p>Everybody is running away from loneliness. It is like a wound; it
hurts. To escape from it, the only way is to be in a crowd, to become
part of a society, to have friends, to create a family, to have husbands
and wives, to have children. In this crowd, the basic effort is that you
will be able to forget your loneliness.</p><p>But nobody has ever succeeded in forgetting it. That which is natural
to you, you can try to ignore -- but you cannot forget it; it will
assert again and again. And the problem becomes more complex because you
have never seen it as it is; you have taken it for granted that you are
born lonely.</p><p>The dictionary meaning is the same; that shows the mind of the people
who create dictionaries. They don't understand at all the vast
difference between loneliness and aloneness. Loneliness is a gap.
Something is missing, something is needed to fill it, and nothing can
ever fill it because it is a misunderstanding in the first place. As you
grow older, the gap also grows bigger. People are so afraid to be by
themselves that they do any kind of stupid thing. I have seen people
playing cards alone; the other party is not there. They have invented
games in which the same person plays cards from both sides.</p><p>Somehow one wants to remain engaged. That engagement may be with
people, may be with work.… There are workaholics; they are afraid when
the weekend</p><p>comes close --</p><p>what are they going to do? And if they don't do anything, they are
left to themselves, and that is the most painful experience.</p><p>You will be surprised to know that it is on the weekends that most of
the accidents in the world happen. People are rushing in their cars to
resort places, to sea beaches, to hill stations, bumper to bumper. It
may take eight hours, ten hours to reach, and there is nothing for them
to do because the whole crowd has come with them. Now their house, their
neighborhood, their city is more peaceful than this sea resort.
Everybody has come.</p><p>But some engagement.…</p><p>People are playing cards, chess; people are watching television for
hours. The average American watches television five hours a day; people
are listening to the radio... just to avoid themselves. For all these
activities, the only reason is -- not to be left alone; it is very
fearful. And this idea is taken from others. Who has told you that to be
alone is a fearful state?</p><p>Those who have known aloneness say something absolutely different.
They say there is nothing more beautiful, more peaceful, more joyful
than being alone.</p><p>But you listen to the crowd. The people who live in misunderstanding
are in such a majority, that who bothers about a Zarathustra, or a
Gautam Buddha? These single individuals can be wrong, can be
hallucinating, can be deceiving themselves or deceiving you, but
millions of people cannot be wrong. And millions of people agree that to
be left to oneself is the worst experience in life; it is hell.</p><p>But any relationship that is created because of the fear, because of
the inner hell of being left alone, cannot be satisfying. Its very root
is poisoned. You don't love your woman, you are simply using her not to
be lonely; neither does she love you. She is also in the same paranoia;
she is using you not to be left alone.</p><p>Naturally, in the name of love anything may happen -- except love.
Fights may happen, arguments may happen, but even they are preferred to
being lonely: at least somebody is there and you are engaged, you can
forget your loneliness. But love is not possible, because there is no
basic foundation for love.</p><p>Love never grows out of fear.</p><p>You are asking, "You said the other day that we are born alone, we
live alone and we die alone. Yet it seems as if from the day we are
born, whatever we are doing, whoever we are, we seek to relate to
others."</p><p>This seeking to relate to others is nothing but escapism. Even the
smallest baby tries to find something to do; if nothing else, then he
will suck his own big toes on his feet. It is an absolutely futile
activity, nothing can come out of it, but it is engagement. He is doing
something. You will see in the stations, in the airports, small boys and
girls carrying their teddy bears; they cannot sleep without them.
Darkness makes their loneliness even more dangerous. The teddy bear is a
great protection; somebody is with them.</p><p>And your God is nothing but a teddy bear for grown-ups.</p><p>You cannot live as you are. Your relationships are not relationships.
They are ugly. You are using the other person, and you know perfectly
well the other person is using you.</p><p>And to use anybody is to reduce him into a thing, into a commodity.
You don't have any respect for the person.</p><p>"In addition," you are asking, "we are usually attracted to being
intimate with one person in particular."</p><p>It has a psychological reason. You are brought up by a mother, by a
father; if you are a boy, you start loving your mother and you start
being jealous of your father because he is a competitor; if you are a
girl, you start loving your father and you hate your mother because she
is a competitor. These are now established facts, not hypotheses, and
the result of it turns your whole life into a misery. The boy carries
the image of his mother as the model of a woman. He becomes conditioned
continuously; he knows only one woman so closely, so intimately. Her
face, her hair, her warmth -- everything becomes an imprint. That's
exactly the scientific word used: it becomes an imprint in his
psychology.</p><p>And the same happens to the girl about the father.</p><p>When you grow up, you fall in love with some woman or with some man
and you think,</p><p>"Perhaps we are made for each other." Nobody is made for anyone. But
why do you feel attracted towards one certain person? It is because of
your imprint. He must resemble your father in some way; she must
resemble your mother in some way.</p><p>Of course no other woman can be exactly a replica of your mother, and
anyway you are not in search of a mother, you are in search of a wife.
But the imprint inside you decides who is the right woman for you. The
moment you see that woman, there is no question of reasoning. You
immediately feel attraction; your imprint immediately starts functioning
-</p><p>- this is the woman for you, or this is the man for you.</p><p>It is good as far as meeting once in a while on the sea beach, in the
movie hall, in the garden is concerned, because you don't come to know
each other totally. But you are both hankering to live together; you
want to be married, and that is one of the most dangerous steps that
lovers can take.</p><p>The moment you are married, you start becoming aware of the totality
of the other person, and you are surprised on every single aspect --
"Something went wrong; this is not the woman, this is not the man" --
because they don't fit with the ideal that you are carrying within you.
And the trouble is multiplied because the woman is carrying an ideal of
her father -- you don't fit with it. You are carrying the ideal of your
mother -- she does not fit with it. That's why all marriages are
failures.</p><p>Only very rare marriages are not failures -- and I hope God should
save you from those marriages which are not failures, because they are
psychologically sick. There are people who are sadists, who enjoy
torturing others, and there are people who are masochists, who enjoy
torturing themselves. If a husband and wife belong to these two
categories, that marriage will be a successful marriage. One is a
masochist and one is a sadist -- it is a perfect marriage, because one
enjoys being tortured and one enjoys torturing.</p><p>But ordinarily it is very difficult to find out in the first place
whether you are a masochist or a sadist, and then to look for your other
polarity.… If you are wise enough you should go to the psychologist and
enquire who you are, a masochist or a sadist? and ask if he can give you
some references which can fit with you.</p><p>Sometimes, just by accident, it happens that a sadist and masochist
become</p><p>married. They are the happiest people in the world; they are
fulfilling each other's needs. But what kind of need is this? -- they
are both psychopaths, and they are living a life of torture. But
otherwise, every marriage is going to fail, for one simple reason: the
imprint is the problem.</p><p>Even in marriage, the basic reason for which you wanted to have the
relationship is not fulfilled. You are more alone when you are with your
wife than when you are alone. To leave husband and wife in a room by
themselves is to make them both utterly miserable.</p><p>One of my friends was retiring; he was a big industrialist, and he
was retiring because of my advice. I said, "You have so much and you
don't have a son; you have two daughters and they are married in rich
families. Now why unnecessarily bother about all kinds of worries -- of
business, and income tax, and this and that? You can close everything;
you have enough. Even if you live one thousand years, it will do."</p><p>He said, "That's true. The real problem is not the business, the real
problem is I will be left alone with my wife. I can retire right now if
you promise me one thing, that you will live with us.</p><p>I said, "This is strange. Are you retiring or am I retiring?"</p><p>He said, "That is the condition. Do you think I am interested in all
these troubles? It is just to escape from my wife."</p><p>The wife was a great social worker. She used to run an orphanage, a
house for widows, and a hospital particularly for people who are beggars
and cannot pay for their treatment.</p><p>I also asked her in the evening, "Do you really enjoy all this, from
the morning till the evening?"</p><p>She said, "Enjoy? It is a kind of austerity, a self-imposed
torture."</p><p>I said, "Why should you impose this torture on yourself?" She said,
"Just to avoid your friend. If we are left alone, that is the worst
experience in life."</p><p>And this is a love marriage, not an arranged marriage. They married
each other against the whole family, the whole society, because they
belonged to different</p><p>religions, different castes; but their imprints gave them signals
that this is the right woman, this is the right man. And all this
happens unconsciously. That's why you cannot answer why you have fallen
in love with a certain woman, or with a certain man. It is not a
conscious decision. It has been decided by your unconscious imprint.</p><p>Amiyo, this whole effort -- whether of relationships or remaining
busy in a thousand and one things -- is just to escape from the idea
that you are lonely. And I want it to be emphatically clear to you that
this is where the meditator and the ordinary man part.</p><p>The ordinary man goes on trying to forget his loneliness, and the
meditator starts getting more and more acquainted with his aloneness. He
has left the world; he has gone to the caves, to the mountains, to the
forest, just for the sake of being alone. He wants to know who he is. In
the crowd, it is difficult; there are so many disturbances. And those
who have known their aloneness have known the greatest blissfulness
possible to human beings -- because your very being is blissful.</p><p>After being in tune with your aloneness, you can relate; then your
relationship will bring great joys to you, because it is not out of
fear. Finding your aloneness you can create, you can be involved in as
many things as you want, because this involvement will not anymore be
running away from yourself. Now it will be your expression; now it will
be the manifestation of all that is your potential.</p><p>Only such a man -- whether he lives alone or lives in the society,
whether he marries or lives unmarried makes no difference -- is always
blissful, peaceful, silent. His life is a dance, is a song, is a
flowering, is a fragrance. Whatever he does, he brings his fragrance to
it.</p><p>But the first basic thing is to know your aloneness absolutely.</p><p>This escape from yourself you have learned from the crowd. Because
everybody is escaping, you start escaping. Every child is born in a
crowd and starts imitating people; what others are doing, he starts
doing. He falls into the same miserable situations as others are in, and
he starts thinking that this is what life is all about. And he has
missed life completely.</p><p>So I remind you, don't misunderstand aloneness as loneliness.
Loneliness is certainly sick; aloneness is perfect health.</p><p>Ginsberg visits Doctor Goldberg. "Ja, you are sick." "Not good
enough. I want another opinion." "Okay," said Doctor Goldberg, "you are
ugly too."</p><p>We are all committing the same kinds of misunderstandings
continually.</p><p>I would like my people to know that your first and most primary step
towards finding the meaning and significance of life is to enter into
your aloneness. It is your temple; it is where your God lives, and you
cannot find this temple anywhere else. You can go on to the moon, to
Mars.…</p><p>Once you have entered your innermost core of being, you cannot
believe your own eyes: you were carrying so much joy, so many blessings,
so much love... and you were escaping from your own treasures.</p><p>Knowing these treasures and their inexhaustibility, you can move now
into relationships, into creativity. You will help people by sharing
your love, not by using them. You will give dignity to people by your
love; you will not destroy their respect. And you will, without any
effort, become a source for them to find their own treasures too.
Whatever you make, whatever you do, you will spread your silence, your
peace, your blessings into everything possible.</p><p>But this basic thing is not taught by any family, by any society, by
any university. People go on living in misery, and it is taken for
granted. Everybody is miserable, so it is nothing much if you are
miserable; you cannot be an exception.</p><p>But I say unto you: You can be an exception. You just have not made
the right effort.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THE OTHER DAY, YOU TALKED ABOUT THE THIRD EYE AS A DOOR FOR</p><p>CONNECTING WITH YOU AND EXISTENCE. WHENEVER I FEEL OPEN,</p><p>FLOWING, CONNECTING WITH YOU, OTHER PEOPLE, NATURE OR MYSELF, I
MOSTLY FEEL IT IN MY HEART AS SILENCE AND EXPANDING</p><p>SPACIOUSNESS, AND SOMETIMES AS RADIATING LIGHT. BELOVED OSHO, IS THIS
THE SAME KIND OF EXPERIENCE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT, OR</p><p>IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONNECTING THROUGH THE THIRD</p><p>EYE OR THE HEART; OR ARE THERE DIFFERENT STAGES?</p><p>Vedant Amod, what you are experiencing is in itself valuable, but it
is not the experience of the third eye. The third eye is a little higher
than your experience.</p><p>The way the mystics in the East have categorized the evolution of
consciousness is in seven centers. Your experiences belong to the fourth
center, the heart. It is one of the most important centers, because it
is exactly in the middle. Three centers are below it and three centers
are above it. That's why love is such a balancing experience.</p><p>Your description is, "Whenever I feel open, flowing, connecting with
you, other people, nature or myself, I mostly feel it in my heart as
silence and expanding spaciousness, and sometimes as radiating light. Is
this the same kind of experience you were talking about?"</p><p>I was talking about the third eye, which is above the heart. There
are three centers above the heart. One is in your throat, which is the
center of creativity; one is between your two eyebrows, exactly in the
middle, which is called the third eye. Just as you have two eyes to know
the outside world... the third eye is only a metaphor, but the
experience is knowing oneself, seeing oneself.</p><p>The last center is sahastrara, the seventh; that is at the top of
your head. As consciousness goes on moving upwards, first you know
yourself, and in the second step you know the whole universe; you know
the whole and yourself as part of it.</p><p>In the old language, the seventh is "knowing God," the sixth is
"knowing yourself," the fifth is "being creative," and the fourth is
"being loving, sharing</p><p>and knowing others."</p><p>With the fourth, your journey becomes certain; it can be guaranteed
that you will reach the seventh. Before the fourth, there is a
possibility you may go astray.</p><p>The first center is the sex center, which is for reproduction -- so
that life continues. Just above it... the sex energy can be moved
upwards, and it is a great experience; for the first time you find
yourself self-sufficient.</p><p>Sex always needs the other. The second center is the center of
contentment, self- sufficiency: you are enough unto yourself. At the
third center you start exploring</p><p>-- who are you? who is this self-sufficient being? These centers are
all significant.…</p><p>The moment you find who you are, the fourth center opens and you find
you are love.</p><p>Before the fourth the journey has started, but there is a possibility
you may not be able to complete it. You can go astray. For example,
finding yourself self- sufficient, contented, you can remain there;
there is no need to do anything anymore. You may not even ask the
question, "Who am I?" The sufficiency is so much that all questions
disappear.</p><p>A master is needed in these moments, so that you don't settle
somewhere in the middle without reaching the goal. And there are
beautiful spots to settle... feeling contented, what is the need to go
on? But the master goes on nagging you and wants you to know who you
are; you may be contented, but at least know who you are. The moment you
know who you are, a new door opens, because you become aware of life, of
love, of joy. You can stay there; it is so much, there is no need to
move any more. But the master goads you on, "Move to the fourth! Unless
you find the purest energy of love, you will not know the splendor of
existence."</p><p>After the fourth, you cannot go astray. Once you have known the
splendor of existence, creativity arises on its own. You have known
beauty; you would like to create it also.</p><p>You want to be a creator. A tremendous longing for creativity arises.
Whenever you feel love, you always feel creativity just as a shadow
coming with it. The man of creativity cannot simply go on looking
outside. There is much beauty</p><p>outside... but he becomes aware that just as there is an infinite sky
outside, to balance it there must be the same infinity inside.</p><p>If a master is available, it is good; if he is not available, these
experiences will lead you onwards.</p><p>Once your third eye is opened, and you see yourself, the whole
expanse of your consciousness, you have come very close to the temple of
God; you are just standing on the steps. You can see the door and you
cannot resist the temptation to go inside the temple and see what is
there. There you find universal consciousness, there you find
enlightenment, there you find ultimate liberation. There you find your
eternity.</p><p>So these are the seven centers -- just arbitrarily created divisions,
so the seeker can move from one to another in a systematic way;
otherwise, there is every possibility, if you are working by yourself,
to get muddled. Particularly before the fourth center there are dangers,
and even after the fourth center.…</p><p>There have been many poets who have lived at the fifth center of
creativity and never gone ahead -- many painters, many dancers, many
singers who created great art, but never moved to the third eye. And
there have been mystics who have remained with the third eye, knowing
their own inner beauty; it is so fulfilling that they thought they had
arrived. Somebody is needed to tell you that there is still something
more ahead; otherwise, in your ignorance, what you will do is almost
unpredictable.</p><p>Mike had decided to join the police force and went along for the
entrance examination.</p><p>The examining sergeant, realizing that the prospective recruit was an
Irishman, decided to ask him a simple question. "Who killed Jesus
Christ?" he asked.</p><p>Mike looked worried and said nothing, so the sergeant told him not to
worry and that he could have some time to think about it. Mike was on
his way home when he met Paddy.</p><p>"Well," said Paddy, "are you a policeman yet?"</p><p>"Not only that," says Mike, "but I am on my first case."</p><p>Man is such that he needs someone who has known the path and knows
the pitfalls, knows the beautiful spots where one can remain stuck, and
has compassion enough to go on pushing you -- even against you -- until
you have reached to the final stage of your potentiality.</p><p>Okay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.</p><p>The Golden Future Chapter #7</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

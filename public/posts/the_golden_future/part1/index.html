IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL TOTALLY\nLOSE THESE FEW GLIMPSES OF LIGHT, BEAUTY, AND CONSCIOUSNESS\nTHAT WE'VE GOT THROUGH BEING SANNYASINS?\nAntar Ashiko, it is a very complicated question. Whatever you achieve in this life will remain with you, but it has to be an achievement not just a glimpse. And there is a great difference between an achievement and a glimpse. You can see the Himalayan peaks from thousands of miles away -- it is a glimpse; but to reach those peaks will be an achievement.\nA glimpse helps you to move onward, towards achievement; but unless something becomes a crystallized experience in your life, it is going to be lost -- you will have to start from the very beginning.\nThere will be a little difference, and that will be that in your unconscious a shadow of your past life, a faraway echo -- as if you have seen something -- will remain. And when you again get the glimpse you may feel that this is not new, I have known it before. But otherwise, only crystallized achievements go with you, consciously, into the other life...\nknowingly, not just a dark shadow, a faraway echo in the unconscious, but consciously knowing that these Himalayan peaks exist, and you have been on those peaks. There will be no doubt about it, no wavering about it, no question about it.\nYou are asking, \"Is it possible that we will totally lose these few glimpses of light, beauty, and consciousness that we have got through being sannyasins?\" Such glimpses you have got in many lives before too, and you have lost them. They never became part of your being; they remained only beautiful memories. But the memories are not achievements. It is as if you have seen something in a dream -- perhaps it may be true, perhaps it may not be true.\nSo if you feel that there is something happening now, make every effort that it does not remain only a glimpse but becomes an actual experience, becomes part of your being.\nOnly then can it go with you into another life.\nIt is possible to take all your experiences with you into another life, and never to begin from scratch but always to begin where you had left off in the past life. But be clear that just a glimpse is very fragile, just a glimpse is very superficial. Howsoever touching it may be in the moment, even tomorrow you may start doubting whether it really happened or you imagined it. And the life after this life is a faraway journey.\nGlimpses are simply incentives to move towards crystallization. Make it an experience so deep that it becomes part of you, and there is no way to forget it or to lose it. Don't remain satisfied with glimpses. Enjoy them, but use them only as an indicator towards greater things to happen.\nTo see something from far away is one thing, and to become that thing is totally another.\nA glimpse of love is just like a breeze that passes within seconds; a glimpse of silence is just like the fragrance of a rose flower that you felt for a moment, and now you don't know where it has gone.\nWhen I say, \"Crystallize your experience,\" I mean it is not enough to have beautiful glimpses. It is good, but not good enough. You should become the fragrance of the rose itself; the glimpse was only an arrow pointing towards the possibility -- it did its work, but you remain there. In the past life also, many times you have come across many beautiful experiences and right now you don't know even that there have been past lives.\nOnly once in a while you see somebody, and you have a very strange feeling, almost weird, as if you have seen this man before -- and certainly not in this life. You come to a place, and suddenly you are startled, as if you had come to this place before too --\nalthough certainly not in this life. Everything seems to be known, but has been dormant in your unconscious.\nLife has a mechanism that whenever a person dies, unless he is enlightened, he becomes almost unconscious; he goes into a coma before death, actual death, happens. So he knows nothing about the death, and he remains in a state of coma till he is born again. All those nine months in the mother's womb are a state of\ncoma; the child is fast asleep twenty-four hours a day for nine months.\nIt rarely happens that somebody dies consciously. It happens only to great meditators, who know well the path death will be coming on because in their meditations they have traveled on the path again and again -- it is the same path. As they go deep in their meditation the body is left far away, mind is left far away, the heart is left far away; only a beautiful silence -- fully alert and conscious -- remains.\nThe same happens when you die. If you have been meditating, then death is not a new experience. You will be surprised that in your meditation you have been dying every day, and you have been coming back to life every day. Such a person dies very consciously, so he knows what death is -- and such a person remains conscious in the mother's womb. He is also born consciously. From his very first moment on the earth, he knows all that has passed before in the past life, and he remembers it.\nI have come across many children And this happens most particularly in India,\nbecause outside India -- where Christianity is prominent or Judaism is prominent or Mohammedanism is prominent -- they have conditioned the mind that there is only one life. They don't know anything about meditation. They have substituted meditation with prayer, and prayer is praising a fictitious god; it is very childish.\nMeditation needs no god -- you are enough. You are a reality, and you explore your reality to the deepest core.\nIn India all the religions are agreed on one point; they differ in their philosophies, they differ on every other thing, but on one thing they are all agreed -- that life is a continuity; death comes millions of times. Death is only a change of the body, a change of the house, and this process goes on -- unless you become totally enlightened. Then there is no need to enter another womb, because life was just a school, a training; you have completed it.\nYour enlightenment is the culmination of your education about existence. Now you need not enter into another body. You can enter into the womb of the universe itself -- you are prepared for it.\nSo whenever you are having glimpses, don't be satisfied with them. Your glimpses should create great discontent in you, not content. They should create a longing that what is seen far away you would like to come closer, and closer, and\ncloser. You don't want just to see it, even from c closeness; you want to become it.\nYou can become love, you can become silence, you can become joy, you can become all these experiences: beauty, light, consciousness. These are not things that you cannot become; they are your potentials. So take every glimpse to its ultimate end. That's what I call crystallization.\nOnce it is crystallized, once you have known yourself to be love, yourself to be light, yourself to be consciousness, then there is no problem of forgetting it. Then these experiences will go with you. And in your future life you will be growing further ahead, from consciousness to superconsciousness; you will be going beyond these experiences.\nBut if you remain satisfied with your glimpses, there is every danger they will be erased.\nDeath is such a shock and such a surgery and such a long coma that when you wake up, you will have forgotten all those glimpses.\n\"Someone stole my bike,\" complained a priest to his minister friend.\n\"Bring up the Ten Commandments in your sermon tomorrow, and as soon as you mention, `Thou shalt not steal,' look around in your congregation; you will find the guilty party. Invite him to come forward. Tell him that this is the way to confess, and this is the way to get the forgiveness of God,\" the minister said confidently.\nThe next day the priest visited the minister and happily reported that he had found his bike. \"Yes\", he went on, \"when I came tòThou shalt not commit adultery' I remembered where I had left it.\"\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nIS IT POSSIBLE THAT I ALWAYS TRANSFORM MY FEELINGS AND\nEXPERIENCES INTO WORDS AND IMAGES ONLY TO GET RID OF THEM? IS IT\nPOSSIBLE THAT I COME TO YOUR FEET WITH TREMENDOUS THIRST, AND\nWHEN I AM FILLED WITH ENERGY, I AM OVERWHELMED WITH THIS\nABSOLUTE NEED OF SHARING -- ONLY TO GET RID OF IT? IS IT POSSIBLE\nTHAT THIS URGE FOR SHARING IS ONLY MY ILLUSION, OR JUST MY WAY\nTO ESCAPE? SOMEBODY TOLD ME THAT I SHOULD BE MORE GENEROUS\nWITH MYSELF. WHAT CAN I DO IF I KNOW NOT ANY OTHER WAY TO BE\nGENEROUS WITH MYSELF THAN SHARING? IS IT TIME FOR ME TO LEARN\nANOTHER WAY? PLEASE HELP ME WITH YOUR GUIDANCE.\nSarjano, what you are experiencing and what you are doing is perfectly right. Sharing your experiences, your energy, your love, your blissfulness, is not an escape from them, neither is it a way to get rid of them. On the contrary, the more you share, the more you will have.\nIt is not the ordinary economics. In the ordinary economics you share and you lose; in the spiritual economics you share and you get more. In ordinary economics you have to be a miser, then only you can become rich... accumulate, never share. In the spiritual economics, if you are a miser whatever you have will be lost. It can live only if you share; it is a living experience. By sharing it continues a dynamic movement.\nI have heard about a young man who had just received a great lottery prize, and he was immensely pleased. He stopped his car because a beggar was standing there. He used to stand there every day, but he had never stopped his car. But today was different. He gave him a note of one hundred rupees. The beggar laughed.\nThe man said, \"I don't understand. Why are you laughing?\"\nHe said, \"It reminds me... once I used to have my own car and I used to be just as generous as you are. I am laughing because soon you will be standing by my side. Don't be so generous! Learn something from my experience.\"\nIn the ordinary economics, the moment you give something, that much is less. But have you felt that by giving love you have less love? Or by sharing your joy, have you felt that your joy is a little bit less?\nIf you have watched, you will be surprised: by sharing, your joy is a little bit more; by loving, your sources of love are flowing more -- you are juicier. By dancing... just to share yourself with your friends you will not find yourself losing something, but gaining something.\nSarjano, don't listen to other people. They know only about the ordinary economics. They don't know anything about a higher economics, where giving is sharing and where not giving is very destructive.\nThe more you give, the more you will have, the less you give, the less you will have. And if you don't give at all, you will not have anything at all.\nBut the people who are suggesting to you that this is not right are creating a problem in your mind about whether you are doing right or wrong. You are doing absolutely right.\nDo it with more totality, without any hesitation, and without holding anything back. Don't listen to others. Listen to your own experience; watch your own experience -- when you give, do you lose something or do you gain something? That should be the decisive thing, not people's advice. The advice of others is dangerous.…\nWhen the Eisenbergs moved to Rome, little Hymie came home from his school in tears.\nHe explained to his mother that the nuns were always asking these Catholic questions and how was he, a nice Jewish boy, supposed to know the answers?\nMrs. Eisenberg's heart swelled with maternal sympathy. \"Hymie,\" she said, \"I'm going to embroider the answers on the inside of your shirt, and you just look\ndown and read them the next time those nuns pick on you.\"\n\"Thanks Mum,\" said Hymie, and he didn't bat an eye when Sister Michele asked him who was the world's most famous virgin. \"Mary,\" he answered.\n\"Very good,\" said the nun. \"And who was her husband?\" \"Joseph,\" answered the boy.\n\"I see you have been studying. Now, can you tell me the name of their son?\" \"Sure,\" said Hymie, \"Calvin Klein.\"\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nTO ME, YOUR FANTASTIC VARIATION OF DYNAMIC MEDITATION YOU DO\nWITH US AT THE END OF EVERY EVENING DISCOURSE IS ONE OF THE\nMOST ENERGY-LADEN EXPERIENCES I'VE EVER HAD. ALL YOUR LOVERS\nARE RADIATING, EVERYTHING IS VIBRATING. I FEEL WE ARE\nBROADCASTING ENERGY WAVES LIKE A HUGE RADIO ANTENNA. THE\nGLOW MUST EVEN BE VISIBLE FROM OUTER SPACE. OSHO, IF WE DON'T\nWAKE UP THIS TIME, THEN WHAT? OR ARE YOU KEEPING EVEN LOUDER\nALARMS UP YOUR SLEEVE?\nPremda, it is almost impossible for you not to wake up this time. I am going to do everything to wake you up. I have ice cold water prepared; I am preparing\npeople to pull you out of your bed and give you a good beating.\nBut anyway, you have to wake up, because for me this is the last time. I will not be here again, so I have to do everything that I can do. And if you miss it will be really unfortunate, because one never knows when you will come across a man who loves you so much that he can be so hard and so cruel as to hit on your head, not bothering what happens to your skull -- but somehow you should get up and open your eyes.\nThe masters in the past have done strange things to wake up their disciples. One Zen master, Fui Hai, had a big monastery. It had two wings, right and left, and in the middle was his cottage. He had a beautiful cat, and all the monks of the monastery loved it.\nThere were almost one thousand monks, five hundred on one side and five hundred on the other side. And they all used to fight, particularly when the master was not at home.\nThe problem was the cat -- who should have it?\nThe right wingers said, \"It belongs to us, we are older than you.\" It was true; the right wing was made first and the left wing was added later on. But the left wingers said, \"It is true that your wing was made first, but then there was no cat. The cat came when the left wing was being made. We own it.\"\nIt was a constant fight, and the cat was being taken from this wing to that wing, and the master got fed up with this whole thing -- every day complaints.\nOne day he gathered all the monks, except one monk who was not present; he had gone to the city to purchase a few things for the monastery.\nThe master said, \"Today I am going to decide this constant quarrel amongst the two wings.\" He took a knife and said, \"Either you say that this cat belongs to one wing, then it's life can be saved; otherwise I'm going to cut it in two and give to both wings half of the cat. There seems to be no other way; it has to be divided.\"\nThey all loved the cat, they all wanted it to be in their wing... they were all silent.\nThe master said, \"If somebody can do something which shows his understanding and his deep meditation, to whichever wing he belongs, he will be the owner of\nthe cat and that wing will have the cat. Come out! You can save the life of the cat; otherwise the cat is finished.\"\nBut people knew that you cannot deceive the master. He had such a clarity of vision that you cannot pretend that you are great meditators; so nobody came out. He cut the cat in two and gave half of the cat to each wing. Everybody was sad -- because what can you do with half the cat? And the master was also sad that out of one thousand monks not a single man could do something to save the cat.\nAt that very time, when he was sitting sadly and the whole monastery was sad, the man who had not been in the monastery came back from the city. He heard the whole story of what had happened. There was blood, the cat had died, and both the wings had half of the cat.\nThey said, \"We had never expected that our master will be so cruel, so hard; he is such a loving and compassionate person. But we cannot blame him; he had given us chances.\"\nBut the man came in front of the master and gave him a good slap on the face.\nThe master laughed and said, \"If you had been here, the poor cat would have been saved.\nYou show your meditativeness. Without your meditations you cannot hit your master; to hit your master you have to know that the body is not you, so the master's body is also not the master. You are not hitting the master but just the body, and that's what I have done. I have cut only the body, not the cat. The cat is still alive, must be born somewhere else. But you have come a little late.\"\nThere is another story about Lin Chi, a Japanese Zen master. He had a disciple to whom he had given the traditional Zen koan to meditate -- \"Meditate on the sound of one hand clapping.\" Now this is absurd. One hand cannot clap, and one hand cannot make any sound. Without clapping there is no possibility of any sound. \"Meditate on it and when you have found the sound of one hand clapping, come and report.\"\nThe young monk went out into the garden, sat under a tree, tried in many ways to think what could be the sound of one hand clapping. Suddenly, he heard a cuckoo in the bamboo grove and he said, \"This must be it!\" He rushed and told\nthe master, \"I have found it. It is the cuckoo in the bamboo grove.\"\nThe master hit him hard on the face and said, \"Don't be foolish; next time be a little more intelligent. Go and meditate again!\"\nEvery day he would come, and by and by it became such a situation; sometimes he would come... the wind passing through the pine trees creates a certain sound, perhaps that is the.… Or sometimes the water running down creating sounds, perhaps that is it.… Or sometimes the lightning in the clouds. Slowly, slowly it became a routine thing. The master would not even ask; as he entered he would slap him, and tell him, \"Go back and meditate.\"\nBut the monk said, \"I have not even told you \"\nThe master said, \"I know what it will be. You just go. Meditate more!\"\nHe said to many other monks, \"This seems to be too much. First he used to at least hear my answer; now he assumes that the answer is going to be wrong!\"\nBut one day he did not come. Two days passed, and seven days passed The\nmaster went to the tree where he used to sit and meditate, and the monk was sitting there, utterly silent.\nHis master shook him and told him, \"So at last you have heard it. This is the sound of one hand clapping, this silence But why did you not come to report?\"\nHe said, \"I forgot everything; the silence was so sweet, so blissful. I am grateful to you that you never listened to my answers, and you went on giving me hard hits. Your compassion is beyond the grasp of ordinary people.\"\nSo Premda, don't be bothered and don't be concerned about others. You have to wake up.\nAnd waking up is such a simple thing -- just the way you wake up in the morning. Have you ever observed do you do some gymnastics, some exercises,\nsome chanting? You simply wake up! The night is over and you open your eyes and jump out of the bed.\nSpiritual awakening is not different from that. Once you understand that you are spiritually asleep.… and that is the problem. People don't think they are\nspiritually asleep, that's why they go on sleeping. Once you understand you are spiritually asleep, then waking is a very simple matter.\nThe hardest thing is to accept that deep in your being there is a sleep, an unconsciousness.\nWhatever meditations are being done here are just to shake you, to bring you to a point where the sleeping consciousness cannot sleep anymore; it has to wake up. It is only a question of simple understanding: You can wake up right now! This silence is enough.\nBrigitte lay in bed on the first night of their honeymoon while Pat sat fully clothed on an armchair in the bedroom. \"Why don't you come to bed?\" Brigitte asked him.\n\"My mother told me that this would be the most exciting night of my life,\" said Pat, \"and I don't want to miss any of it by going to sleep!\"\nIt is very easy to misunderstand. It is also very easy to understand. It all depends on you.\nAre you ready to wake up? Then nothing can prevent you, and no technique is needed.\nBut if you are not ready to wake up, then no technique can help you. You have to see your life as the life of a somnambulist who is sleep-walking, doing things asleep...\nfighting, saying the same things which he has said before and have always brought anger, irritation, in other people.\nIt is a question of watching your life. Is it a life of a man who is awake? Can a man who is awake behave the way the world is behaving?\nYou have been angry, you have been sorry for it thousands of times, and it has still not become clear to you that again you will be angry and again you will be sorry. What you are doing, it cannot be said that you are doing it fully awake.\nYour whole life is more like a robot; you are just going through mechanical actions. You suffer, and you decide to change, but when the time to change comes, you forget it completely.\nI have heard about a Christian monk who used to give sermons in different places, and his basic sermon was based on Jesus' teaching of the Sermon on the Mount. He would say again and again that if somebody slaps you on one cheek, give him the other cheek too.\nOne man had been listening to this so many times, he got bored. One day he stood up when the monk was saying this, and went ahead and slapped him. There was great anger in the Christian monk's eyes, but seeing the crowd -- and remembering what he has been telling them for so many years -- he gave the other cheek, hoping that this idiot will not hit it. But that man was also a unique individual -- he hit even harder!\nAnd that very moment, chaos broke; the Christian monk jumped on the man and started hitting him. The man said, \"What are you doing? It is against your preachings! I have been listening to your sermons.\"\nThe monk said, \"Forget all my sermons. Jesus only said `Give the other cheek.' There is no third cheek. Now I am free, and I will show you \"\nBut the man said, \"Giving the other cheek means you should not be revengeful.\"\nThe monk said, \"Forget all that nonsense! Giving the other cheek simply means giving the other cheek, and there is no third cheek. You have made me completely free, and now I will teach you the real lesson!\"\nAnd he has been teaching his whole life but perhaps that was also talking in his\nsleep, never penetrating to the meaning of the words he is saying and what he is doing.\nGurdjieff remembers his father. His father died when Gurdjieff was only nine years old, and must have been a very unique man. He called Gurdjieff close to him and told him,\n\"I'm dying, and I don't have anything as a heritage for you. I'm leaving you poor and orphaned. Just one advice I want to give to you -- that is the advice given to me by my father. I have found that that advice has proved to me the richest thing\nthat any father can give to his son. You are so young; perhaps you may not be able to understand it. Just remember it; soon you will be able to understand it also, and whether you understand it or not, start behaving accordingly. Listen very closely and then repeat to me what I'm saying.\"\nIt was simple advice. The advice was that \"If somebody insults you, humiliates you, hurts you, you are not to react immediately. You have to say to that person, \"You will have to wait twenty-four hours, and then I will come to answer you. This is something sacred to me; I have given a promise to my dying father. So wait twenty-four hours and then go to the person. In those twenty-four hours you will see that he was right, or you may see that he was not right, but it is absolutely stupid to get into a quarrel. Those twenty-four hours will have given you a chance to be more alert. People react immediately -- there is not time enough to be aware. They react just like machines. So if you find that he was right, go and thank him. If you find he was wrong, there is no need to go; or if you want to go, you can go and say `You seem to be in a misunderstanding.'\"\nAnd Gurdjieff used to say, later in his life, \"That simple advice of my dying father has transformed my whole life because it gave me a certain awareness, a certain awakening. I could not do anything immediately, instantly. I had to wait for twenty-four hours. And you cannot remain angry for twenty-four hours.\"\nA man who is awake behaves in a totally different way from the whole humanity, which is fast asleep.\nOne of my friends, he was a colleague in the same university where I was a teacher, said to me \"I have been trying to drop my smoking, for almost twenty years.\"\nI said, \"That is too long a time to drop a cigarette; just give me a cigarette and I can drop it right now.\"\nHe said, \"Don't make a laughing stock of me. I have worked hard to drop it, and sometimes for a few hours, or sometimes even for few days, I manage not to smoke. But finally I have to give way. And now I have even dropped fighting; it is meaningless --\ntwenty years fighting.\"\nI said, \"You don't understand simple laws of life. You are a man fast asleep, and\nin sleep you cannot make any decisions, any commitments. My suggestion is that you do one thing: you smoke more consciously.\"\nHe said, \"What -- smoke? I want to drop it.\"\nI said, \"Just listen to what I am saying, you smoke more consciously. Take the packet from your pocket very slowly and consciously. Pull the cigarette out very slowly -- there is no hurry. Look at the cigarette from all sides, put it in your mouth, wait. There is no hurry. Go very slow-motion, just as if a film is going in slow motion.\nHe said, \"What is that going to do?\"\nI said, \"That we will se later on... then take your lighter, look at it.\" He said, \"You are making me a fool -- what is that going to do?\"\nI said, \"You just Twenty years you have done it your way; twenty days you do\nit my way. Look at the lighter, then light the cigarette, then smoke as slowly as possible. And be watchful that the smoke is going in, then the smoke is going out. That is the oldest meditation, vipassana. Gautam Buddha may never have thought that it will be used with a cigarette and a cigarette lighter -- but I have to manage for him.\nHe would not do Vipassana, but this.… He said, \"Okay, I will try it, twenty days it is not much.\"\nBut the second day he came to me and said, \"This is strange. Doing things so slowly makes me so alert; smoking, and watching the smoke going in and the smoke going out makes me so silent that already, in two days, I am smoking almost fifty percent less.\nI said, \"Just wait twenty days.\"\nHe said, \"I don't think it will last twenty days; at the most five days and it will be finished.\"\nI said, \"Don't be in a hurry to finish it, because if anything remains clinging it will enforce you again. So go very slowly; there is no hurry, and there is no harm. It does not matter -- at the most you may die two years earlier. But\nanyway, what were you going to do in those two years -- just smoke... more! So there is no harm anyway; the world is too populated, and if people go on disappearing a little earlier, making space for other people, it is very compassionate of them.\"\nHe said,\"You are a strange fellow.\" And after the fourth day he told me, \"Now, as my hand moves towards the pocket, suddenly a stop comes -- from where, I don't know. I have not been smoking for one whole day because each time I try to take a cigarette, I cannot take the packet out. What is the secret of it?\"\nI said, \"There is no secret; you have just learned to smoke consciously, with awareness.\nAnd nobody can smoke with awareness, because smoking is not a sin -- smoking is simply a stupidity. If you are alert and awake, you cannot be so stupid. There is fresh air available; you can go and have good breathing, deep breaths, fresh air, perfumed with flowers. You must be an idiot if you have to pay money to make your breathing dirty, dirty with nicotine, harming your lungs, harming your life; and there is no point in it.\"\nPremda, people are really fast asleep; it is a wonder they don't snore with open eyes.\nKing Arthur, going on a two-year dragon hunting expedition, ordered Merlin the Wise to make a chastity belt for Guinevere to wear whilst he was away. Merlin came up with a very unorthodox design -- one that had a large gaping aperture in the area that would normally be most strongly fortified.\n\"That's absurd,\" said Arthur. \"This belt is not functional.\"\n\"Yes, it is,\" said Merlin. Picking up a spare magic wand, he passed it through the opening\n-- instantly a guillotine-like blade came down and chopped the wand in two. \"Ingenious!\" cried Arthur.\nAfter outfitting Guinevere with the belt, he rode off to slay dragons, his mind at peace.\nTwo years later, when Arthur came back, his first official act was to assemble all of the Knights of the Round Table and send them to the court physician for a special inspection.\nHis frown grew severe as he learned that every member of the Round Table was nicked, cut, or scratched -- all but one. Sir Lancelot was impeccable.\nArthur called for him immediately, and smiled at his best knight. \"Sir Lancelot,\" he declared, \"you are the only one of my knights who did not assail the chastity of my lady while I was off slaying dragons. You have upheld the honor of the Round Table and I am proud of you. You shall be rewarded. You may have anything in the kingdom you desire, you have but to name it. State your wish Sir Lancelot.\"\nBut Sir Lancelot was speechless.… Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\nThe Golden Future Chapter #3\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5587","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_future/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_golden_future/>The Golden Future</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: Peaks beyond peaks unending</h1><div class=post-meta>27 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5587 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Golden_Future/part1.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

GO THROUGH THE WHOLE EVOLUTION OF MANKIND ONE MORE</p><p>TIME, I WAS VERY TOUCHED. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL TOTALLY</p><p>LOSE THESE FEW GLIMPSES OF LIGHT, BEAUTY, AND CONSCIOUSNESS</p><p>THAT WE'VE GOT THROUGH BEING SANNYASINS?</p><p>Antar Ashiko, it is a very complicated question. Whatever you achieve
in this life will remain with you, but it has to be an achievement not
just a glimpse. And there is a great difference between an achievement
and a glimpse. You can see the Himalayan peaks from thousands of miles
away -- it is a glimpse; but to reach those peaks will be an
achievement.</p><p>A glimpse helps you to move onward, towards achievement; but unless
something becomes a crystallized experience in your life, it is going to
be lost -- you will have to start from the very beginning.</p><p>There will be a little difference, and that will be that in your
unconscious a shadow of your past life, a faraway echo -- as if you have
seen something -- will remain. And when you again get the glimpse you
may feel that this is not new, I have known it before. But otherwise,
only crystallized achievements go with you, consciously, into the other
life...</p><p>knowingly, not just a dark shadow, a faraway echo in the unconscious,
but consciously knowing that these Himalayan peaks exist, and you have
been on those peaks. There will be no doubt about it, no wavering about
it, no question about it.</p><p>You are asking, "Is it possible that we will totally lose these few
glimpses of light, beauty, and consciousness that we have got through
being sannyasins?" Such glimpses you have got in many lives before too,
and you have lost them. They never became part of your being; they
remained only beautiful memories. But the memories are not achievements.
It is as if you have seen something in a dream -- perhaps it may be
true, perhaps it may not be true.</p><p>So if you feel that there is something happening now, make every
effort that it does not remain only a glimpse but becomes an actual
experience, becomes part of your being.</p><p>Only then can it go with you into another life.</p><p>It is possible to take all your experiences with you into another
life, and never to begin from scratch but always to begin where you had
left off in the past life. But be clear that just a glimpse is very
fragile, just a glimpse is very superficial. Howsoever touching it may
be in the moment, even tomorrow you may start doubting whether it really
happened or you imagined it. And the life after this life is a faraway
journey.</p><p>Glimpses are simply incentives to move towards crystallization. Make
it an experience so deep that it becomes part of you, and there is no
way to forget it or to lose it. Don't remain satisfied with glimpses.
Enjoy them, but use them only as an indicator towards greater things to
happen.</p><p>To see something from far away is one thing, and to become that thing
is totally another.</p><p>A glimpse of love is just like a breeze that passes within seconds; a
glimpse of silence is just like the fragrance of a rose flower that you
felt for a moment, and now you don't know where it has gone.</p><p>When I say, "Crystallize your experience," I mean it is not enough to
have beautiful glimpses. It is good, but not good enough. You should
become the fragrance of the rose itself; the glimpse was only an arrow
pointing towards the possibility -- it did its work, but you remain
there. In the past life also, many times you have come across many
beautiful experiences and right now you don't know even that there have
been past lives.</p><p>Only once in a while you see somebody, and you have a very strange
feeling, almost weird, as if you have seen this man before -- and
certainly not in this life. You come to a place, and suddenly you are
startled, as if you had come to this place before too --</p><p>although certainly not in this life. Everything seems to be known,
but has been dormant in your unconscious.</p><p>Life has a mechanism that whenever a person dies, unless he is
enlightened, he becomes almost unconscious; he goes into a coma before
death, actual death, happens. So he knows nothing about the death, and
he remains in a state of coma till he is born again. All those nine
months in the mother's womb are a state of</p><p>coma; the child is fast asleep twenty-four hours a day for nine
months.</p><p>It rarely happens that somebody dies consciously. It happens only to
great meditators, who know well the path death will be coming on because
in their meditations they have traveled on the path again and again --
it is the same path. As they go deep in their meditation the body is
left far away, mind is left far away, the heart is left far away; only a
beautiful silence -- fully alert and conscious -- remains.</p><p>The same happens when you die. If you have been meditating, then
death is not a new experience. You will be surprised that in your
meditation you have been dying every day, and you have been coming back
to life every day. Such a person dies very consciously, so he knows what
death is -- and such a person remains conscious in the mother's womb. He
is also born consciously. From his very first moment on the earth, he
knows all that has passed before in the past life, and he remembers
it.</p><p>I have come across many children And this happens most particularly
in India,</p><p>because outside India -- where Christianity is prominent or Judaism
is prominent or Mohammedanism is prominent -- they have conditioned the
mind that there is only one life. They don't know anything about
meditation. They have substituted meditation with prayer, and prayer is
praising a fictitious god; it is very childish.</p><p>Meditation needs no god -- you are enough. You are a reality, and you
explore your reality to the deepest core.</p><p>In India all the religions are agreed on one point; they differ in
their philosophies, they differ on every other thing, but on one thing
they are all agreed -- that life is a continuity; death comes millions
of times. Death is only a change of the body, a change of the house, and
this process goes on -- unless you become totally enlightened. Then
there is no need to enter another womb, because life was just a school,
a training; you have completed it.</p><p>Your enlightenment is the culmination of your education about
existence. Now you need not enter into another body. You can enter into
the womb of the universe itself -- you are prepared for it.</p><p>So whenever you are having glimpses, don't be satisfied with them.
Your glimpses should create great discontent in you, not content. They
should create a longing that what is seen far away you would like to
come closer, and closer, and</p><p>closer. You don't want just to see it, even from c closeness; you
want to become it.</p><p>You can become love, you can become silence, you can become joy, you
can become all these experiences: beauty, light, consciousness. These
are not things that you cannot become; they are your potentials. So take
every glimpse to its ultimate end. That's what I call
crystallization.</p><p>Once it is crystallized, once you have known yourself to be love,
yourself to be light, yourself to be consciousness, then there is no
problem of forgetting it. Then these experiences will go with you. And
in your future life you will be growing further ahead, from
consciousness to superconsciousness; you will be going beyond these
experiences.</p><p>But if you remain satisfied with your glimpses, there is every danger
they will be erased.</p><p>Death is such a shock and such a surgery and such a long coma that
when you wake up, you will have forgotten all those glimpses.</p><p>"Someone stole my bike," complained a priest to his minister
friend.</p><p>"Bring up the Ten Commandments in your sermon tomorrow, and as soon
as you mention, `Thou shalt not steal,' look around in your
congregation; you will find the guilty party. Invite him to come
forward. Tell him that this is the way to confess, and this is the way
to get the forgiveness of God," the minister said confidently.</p><p>The next day the priest visited the minister and happily reported
that he had found his bike. "Yes", he went on, "when I came tòThou shalt
not commit adultery' I remembered where I had left it."</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I ALWAYS TRANSFORM MY FEELINGS AND</p><p>EXPERIENCES INTO WORDS AND IMAGES ONLY TO GET RID OF THEM? IS IT</p><p>POSSIBLE THAT I COME TO YOUR FEET WITH TREMENDOUS THIRST, AND</p><p>WHEN I AM FILLED WITH ENERGY, I AM OVERWHELMED WITH THIS</p><p>ABSOLUTE NEED OF SHARING -- ONLY TO GET RID OF IT? IS IT POSSIBLE</p><p>THAT THIS URGE FOR SHARING IS ONLY MY ILLUSION, OR JUST MY WAY</p><p>TO ESCAPE? SOMEBODY TOLD ME THAT I SHOULD BE MORE GENEROUS</p><p>WITH MYSELF. WHAT CAN I DO IF I KNOW NOT ANY OTHER WAY TO BE</p><p>GENEROUS WITH MYSELF THAN SHARING? IS IT TIME FOR ME TO LEARN</p><p>ANOTHER WAY? PLEASE HELP ME WITH YOUR GUIDANCE.</p><p>Sarjano, what you are experiencing and what you are doing is
perfectly right. Sharing your experiences, your energy, your love, your
blissfulness, is not an escape from them, neither is it a way to get rid
of them. On the contrary, the more you share, the more you will
have.</p><p>It is not the ordinary economics. In the ordinary economics you share
and you lose; in the spiritual economics you share and you get more. In
ordinary economics you have to be a miser, then only you can become
rich... accumulate, never share. In the spiritual economics, if you are
a miser whatever you have will be lost. It can live only if you share;
it is a living experience. By sharing it continues a dynamic
movement.</p><p>I have heard about a young man who had just received a great lottery
prize, and he was immensely pleased. He stopped his car because a beggar
was standing there. He used to stand there every day, but he had never
stopped his car. But today was different. He gave him a note of one
hundred rupees. The beggar laughed.</p><p>The man said, "I don't understand. Why are you laughing?"</p><p>He said, "It reminds me... once I used to have my own car and I used
to be just as generous as you are. I am laughing because soon you will
be standing by my side. Don't be so generous! Learn something from my
experience."</p><p>In the ordinary economics, the moment you give something, that much
is less. But have you felt that by giving love you have less love? Or by
sharing your joy, have you felt that your joy is a little bit less?</p><p>If you have watched, you will be surprised: by sharing, your joy is a
little bit more; by loving, your sources of love are flowing more -- you
are juicier. By dancing... just to share yourself with your friends you
will not find yourself losing something, but gaining something.</p><p>Sarjano, don't listen to other people. They know only about the
ordinary economics. They don't know anything about a higher economics,
where giving is sharing and where not giving is very destructive.</p><p>The more you give, the more you will have, the less you give, the
less you will have. And if you don't give at all, you will not have
anything at all.</p><p>But the people who are suggesting to you that this is not right are
creating a problem in your mind about whether you are doing right or
wrong. You are doing absolutely right.</p><p>Do it with more totality, without any hesitation, and without holding
anything back. Don't listen to others. Listen to your own experience;
watch your own experience -- when you give, do you lose something or do
you gain something? That should be the decisive thing, not people's
advice. The advice of others is dangerous.…</p><p>When the Eisenbergs moved to Rome, little Hymie came home from his
school in tears.</p><p>He explained to his mother that the nuns were always asking these
Catholic questions and how was he, a nice Jewish boy, supposed to know
the answers?</p><p>Mrs. Eisenberg's heart swelled with maternal sympathy. "Hymie," she
said, "I'm going to embroider the answers on the inside of your shirt,
and you just look</p><p>down and read them the next time those nuns pick on you."</p><p>"Thanks Mum," said Hymie, and he didn't bat an eye when Sister
Michele asked him who was the world's most famous virgin. "Mary," he
answered.</p><p>"Very good," said the nun. "And who was her husband?" "Joseph,"
answered the boy.</p><p>"I see you have been studying. Now, can you tell me the name of their
son?" "Sure," said Hymie, "Calvin Klein."</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>TO ME, YOUR FANTASTIC VARIATION OF DYNAMIC MEDITATION YOU DO</p><p>WITH US AT THE END OF EVERY EVENING DISCOURSE IS ONE OF THE</p><p>MOST ENERGY-LADEN EXPERIENCES I'VE EVER HAD. ALL YOUR LOVERS</p><p>ARE RADIATING, EVERYTHING IS VIBRATING. I FEEL WE ARE</p><p>BROADCASTING ENERGY WAVES LIKE A HUGE RADIO ANTENNA. THE</p><p>GLOW MUST EVEN BE VISIBLE FROM OUTER SPACE. OSHO, IF WE DON'T</p><p>WAKE UP THIS TIME, THEN WHAT? OR ARE YOU KEEPING EVEN LOUDER</p><p>ALARMS UP YOUR SLEEVE?</p><p>Premda, it is almost impossible for you not to wake up this time. I
am going to do everything to wake you up. I have ice cold water
prepared; I am preparing</p><p>people to pull you out of your bed and give you a good beating.</p><p>But anyway, you have to wake up, because for me this is the last
time. I will not be here again, so I have to do everything that I can
do. And if you miss it will be really unfortunate, because one never
knows when you will come across a man who loves you so much that he can
be so hard and so cruel as to hit on your head, not bothering what
happens to your skull -- but somehow you should get up and open your
eyes.</p><p>The masters in the past have done strange things to wake up their
disciples. One Zen master, Fui Hai, had a big monastery. It had two
wings, right and left, and in the middle was his cottage. He had a
beautiful cat, and all the monks of the monastery loved it.</p><p>There were almost one thousand monks, five hundred on one side and
five hundred on the other side. And they all used to fight, particularly
when the master was not at home.</p><p>The problem was the cat -- who should have it?</p><p>The right wingers said, "It belongs to us, we are older than you." It
was true; the right wing was made first and the left wing was added
later on. But the left wingers said, "It is true that your wing was made
first, but then there was no cat. The cat came when the left wing was
being made. We own it."</p><p>It was a constant fight, and the cat was being taken from this wing
to that wing, and the master got fed up with this whole thing -- every
day complaints.</p><p>One day he gathered all the monks, except one monk who was not
present; he had gone to the city to purchase a few things for the
monastery.</p><p>The master said, "Today I am going to decide this constant quarrel
amongst the two wings." He took a knife and said, "Either you say that
this cat belongs to one wing, then it's life can be saved; otherwise I'm
going to cut it in two and give to both wings half of the cat. There
seems to be no other way; it has to be divided."</p><p>They all loved the cat, they all wanted it to be in their wing...
they were all silent.</p><p>The master said, "If somebody can do something which shows his
understanding and his deep meditation, to whichever wing he belongs, he
will be the owner of</p><p>the cat and that wing will have the cat. Come out! You can save the
life of the cat; otherwise the cat is finished."</p><p>But people knew that you cannot deceive the master. He had such a
clarity of vision that you cannot pretend that you are great meditators;
so nobody came out. He cut the cat in two and gave half of the cat to
each wing. Everybody was sad -- because what can you do with half the
cat? And the master was also sad that out of one thousand monks not a
single man could do something to save the cat.</p><p>At that very time, when he was sitting sadly and the whole monastery
was sad, the man who had not been in the monastery came back from the
city. He heard the whole story of what had happened. There was blood,
the cat had died, and both the wings had half of the cat.</p><p>They said, "We had never expected that our master will be so cruel,
so hard; he is such a loving and compassionate person. But we cannot
blame him; he had given us chances."</p><p>But the man came in front of the master and gave him a good slap on
the face.</p><p>The master laughed and said, "If you had been here, the poor cat
would have been saved.</p><p>You show your meditativeness. Without your meditations you cannot hit
your master; to hit your master you have to know that the body is not
you, so the master's body is also not the master. You are not hitting
the master but just the body, and that's what I have done. I have cut
only the body, not the cat. The cat is still alive, must be born
somewhere else. But you have come a little late."</p><p>There is another story about Lin Chi, a Japanese Zen master. He had a
disciple to whom he had given the traditional Zen koan to meditate --
"Meditate on the sound of one hand clapping." Now this is absurd. One
hand cannot clap, and one hand cannot make any sound. Without clapping
there is no possibility of any sound. "Meditate on it and when you have
found the sound of one hand clapping, come and report."</p><p>The young monk went out into the garden, sat under a tree, tried in
many ways to think what could be the sound of one hand clapping.
Suddenly, he heard a cuckoo in the bamboo grove and he said, "This must
be it!" He rushed and told</p><p>the master, "I have found it. It is the cuckoo in the bamboo
grove."</p><p>The master hit him hard on the face and said, "Don't be foolish; next
time be a little more intelligent. Go and meditate again!"</p><p>Every day he would come, and by and by it became such a situation;
sometimes he would come... the wind passing through the pine trees
creates a certain sound, perhaps that is the.… Or sometimes the water
running down creating sounds, perhaps that is it.… Or sometimes the
lightning in the clouds. Slowly, slowly it became a routine thing. The
master would not even ask; as he entered he would slap him, and tell
him, "Go back and meditate."</p><p>But the monk said, "I have not even told you "</p><p>The master said, "I know what it will be. You just go. Meditate
more!"</p><p>He said to many other monks, "This seems to be too much. First he
used to at least hear my answer; now he assumes that the answer is going
to be wrong!"</p><p>But one day he did not come. Two days passed, and seven days passed
The</p><p>master went to the tree where he used to sit and meditate, and the
monk was sitting there, utterly silent.</p><p>His master shook him and told him, "So at last you have heard it.
This is the sound of one hand clapping, this silence But why did you not
come to report?"</p><p>He said, "I forgot everything; the silence was so sweet, so blissful.
I am grateful to you that you never listened to my answers, and you went
on giving me hard hits. Your compassion is beyond the grasp of ordinary
people."</p><p>So Premda, don't be bothered and don't be concerned about others. You
have to wake up.</p><p>And waking up is such a simple thing -- just the way you wake up in
the morning. Have you ever observed do you do some gymnastics, some
exercises,</p><p>some chanting? You simply wake up! The night is over and you open
your eyes and jump out of the bed.</p><p>Spiritual awakening is not different from that. Once you understand
that you are spiritually asleep.… and that is the problem. People don't
think they are</p><p>spiritually asleep, that's why they go on sleeping. Once you
understand you are spiritually asleep, then waking is a very simple
matter.</p><p>The hardest thing is to accept that deep in your being there is a
sleep, an unconsciousness.</p><p>Whatever meditations are being done here are just to shake you, to
bring you to a point where the sleeping consciousness cannot sleep
anymore; it has to wake up. It is only a question of simple
understanding: You can wake up right now! This silence is enough.</p><p>Brigitte lay in bed on the first night of their honeymoon while Pat
sat fully clothed on an armchair in the bedroom. "Why don't you come to
bed?" Brigitte asked him.</p><p>"My mother told me that this would be the most exciting night of my
life," said Pat, "and I don't want to miss any of it by going to
sleep!"</p><p>It is very easy to misunderstand. It is also very easy to understand.
It all depends on you.</p><p>Are you ready to wake up? Then nothing can prevent you, and no
technique is needed.</p><p>But if you are not ready to wake up, then no technique can help you.
You have to see your life as the life of a somnambulist who is
sleep-walking, doing things asleep...</p><p>fighting, saying the same things which he has said before and have
always brought anger, irritation, in other people.</p><p>It is a question of watching your life. Is it a life of a man who is
awake? Can a man who is awake behave the way the world is behaving?</p><p>You have been angry, you have been sorry for it thousands of times,
and it has still not become clear to you that again you will be angry
and again you will be sorry. What you are doing, it cannot be said that
you are doing it fully awake.</p><p>Your whole life is more like a robot; you are just going through
mechanical actions. You suffer, and you decide to change, but when the
time to change comes, you forget it completely.</p><p>I have heard about a Christian monk who used to give sermons in
different places, and his basic sermon was based on Jesus' teaching of
the Sermon on the Mount. He would say again and again that if somebody
slaps you on one cheek, give him the other cheek too.</p><p>One man had been listening to this so many times, he got bored. One
day he stood up when the monk was saying this, and went ahead and
slapped him. There was great anger in the Christian monk's eyes, but
seeing the crowd -- and remembering what he has been telling them for so
many years -- he gave the other cheek, hoping that this idiot will not
hit it. But that man was also a unique individual -- he hit even
harder!</p><p>And that very moment, chaos broke; the Christian monk jumped on the
man and started hitting him. The man said, "What are you doing? It is
against your preachings! I have been listening to your sermons."</p><p>The monk said, "Forget all my sermons. Jesus only said `Give the
other cheek.' There is no third cheek. Now I am free, and I will show
you "</p><p>But the man said, "Giving the other cheek means you should not be
revengeful."</p><p>The monk said, "Forget all that nonsense! Giving the other cheek
simply means giving the other cheek, and there is no third cheek. You
have made me completely free, and now I will teach you the real
lesson!"</p><p>And he has been teaching his whole life but perhaps that was also
talking in his</p><p>sleep, never penetrating to the meaning of the words he is saying and
what he is doing.</p><p>Gurdjieff remembers his father. His father died when Gurdjieff was
only nine years old, and must have been a very unique man. He called
Gurdjieff close to him and told him,</p><p>"I'm dying, and I don't have anything as a heritage for you. I'm
leaving you poor and orphaned. Just one advice I want to give to you --
that is the advice given to me by my father. I have found that that
advice has proved to me the richest thing</p><p>that any father can give to his son. You are so young; perhaps you
may not be able to understand it. Just remember it; soon you will be
able to understand it also, and whether you understand it or not, start
behaving accordingly. Listen very closely and then repeat to me what I'm
saying."</p><p>It was simple advice. The advice was that "If somebody insults you,
humiliates you, hurts you, you are not to react immediately. You have to
say to that person, "You will have to wait twenty-four hours, and then I
will come to answer you. This is something sacred to me; I have given a
promise to my dying father. So wait twenty-four hours and then go to the
person. In those twenty-four hours you will see that he was right, or
you may see that he was not right, but it is absolutely stupid to get
into a quarrel. Those twenty-four hours will have given you a chance to
be more alert. People react immediately -- there is not time enough to
be aware. They react just like machines. So if you find that he was
right, go and thank him. If you find he was wrong, there is no need to
go; or if you want to go, you can go and say `You seem to be in a
misunderstanding.'"</p><p>And Gurdjieff used to say, later in his life, "That simple advice of
my dying father has transformed my whole life because it gave me a
certain awareness, a certain awakening. I could not do anything
immediately, instantly. I had to wait for twenty-four hours. And you
cannot remain angry for twenty-four hours."</p><p>A man who is awake behaves in a totally different way from the whole
humanity, which is fast asleep.</p><p>One of my friends, he was a colleague in the same university where I
was a teacher, said to me "I have been trying to drop my smoking, for
almost twenty years."</p><p>I said, "That is too long a time to drop a cigarette; just give me a
cigarette and I can drop it right now."</p><p>He said, "Don't make a laughing stock of me. I have worked hard to
drop it, and sometimes for a few hours, or sometimes even for few days,
I manage not to smoke. But finally I have to give way. And now I have
even dropped fighting; it is meaningless --</p><p>twenty years fighting."</p><p>I said, "You don't understand simple laws of life. You are a man fast
asleep, and</p><p>in sleep you cannot make any decisions, any commitments. My
suggestion is that you do one thing: you smoke more consciously."</p><p>He said, "What -- smoke? I want to drop it."</p><p>I said, "Just listen to what I am saying, you smoke more consciously.
Take the packet from your pocket very slowly and consciously. Pull the
cigarette out very slowly -- there is no hurry. Look at the cigarette
from all sides, put it in your mouth, wait. There is no hurry. Go very
slow-motion, just as if a film is going in slow motion.</p><p>He said, "What is that going to do?"</p><p>I said, "That we will se later on... then take your lighter, look at
it." He said, "You are making me a fool -- what is that going to
do?"</p><p>I said, "You just Twenty years you have done it your way; twenty days
you do</p><p>it my way. Look at the lighter, then light the cigarette, then smoke
as slowly as possible. And be watchful that the smoke is going in, then
the smoke is going out. That is the oldest meditation, vipassana. Gautam
Buddha may never have thought that it will be used with a cigarette and
a cigarette lighter -- but I have to manage for him.</p><p>He would not do Vipassana, but this.… He said, "Okay, I will try it,
twenty days it is not much."</p><p>But the second day he came to me and said, "This is strange. Doing
things so slowly makes me so alert; smoking, and watching the smoke
going in and the smoke going out makes me so silent that already, in two
days, I am smoking almost fifty percent less.</p><p>I said, "Just wait twenty days."</p><p>He said, "I don't think it will last twenty days; at the most five
days and it will be finished."</p><p>I said, "Don't be in a hurry to finish it, because if anything
remains clinging it will enforce you again. So go very slowly; there is
no hurry, and there is no harm. It does not matter -- at the most you
may die two years earlier. But</p><p>anyway, what were you going to do in those two years -- just smoke...
more! So there is no harm anyway; the world is too populated, and if
people go on disappearing a little earlier, making space for other
people, it is very compassionate of them."</p><p>He said,"You are a strange fellow." And after the fourth day he told
me, "Now, as my hand moves towards the pocket, suddenly a stop comes --
from where, I don't know. I have not been smoking for one whole day
because each time I try to take a cigarette, I cannot take the packet
out. What is the secret of it?"</p><p>I said, "There is no secret; you have just learned to smoke
consciously, with awareness.</p><p>And nobody can smoke with awareness, because smoking is not a sin --
smoking is simply a stupidity. If you are alert and awake, you cannot be
so stupid. There is fresh air available; you can go and have good
breathing, deep breaths, fresh air, perfumed with flowers. You must be
an idiot if you have to pay money to make your breathing dirty, dirty
with nicotine, harming your lungs, harming your life; and there is no
point in it."</p><p>Premda, people are really fast asleep; it is a wonder they don't
snore with open eyes.</p><p>King Arthur, going on a two-year dragon hunting expedition, ordered
Merlin the Wise to make a chastity belt for Guinevere to wear whilst he
was away. Merlin came up with a very unorthodox design -- one that had a
large gaping aperture in the area that would normally be most strongly
fortified.</p><p>"That's absurd," said Arthur. "This belt is not functional."</p><p>"Yes, it is," said Merlin. Picking up a spare magic wand, he passed
it through the opening</p><p>-- instantly a guillotine-like blade came down and chopped the wand
in two. "Ingenious!" cried Arthur.</p><p>After outfitting Guinevere with the belt, he rode off to slay
dragons, his mind at peace.</p><p>Two years later, when Arthur came back, his first official act was to
assemble all of the Knights of the Round Table and send them to the
court physician for a special inspection.</p><p>His frown grew severe as he learned that every member of the Round
Table was nicked, cut, or scratched -- all but one. Sir Lancelot was
impeccable.</p><p>Arthur called for him immediately, and smiled at his best knight.
"Sir Lancelot," he declared, "you are the only one of my knights who did
not assail the chastity of my lady while I was off slaying dragons. You
have upheld the honor of the Round Table and I am proud of you. You
shall be rewarded. You may have anything in the kingdom you desire, you
have but to name it. State your wish Sir Lancelot."</p><p>But Sir Lancelot was speechless.… Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p>The Golden Future Chapter #3</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

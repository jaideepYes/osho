Ananda Prem: <span class=p>Acharayaji, before asking a question I
would like to tell you my experience in meditation with special
reference to controlled LSD-experimentation I underwent.</span></h1><p><br></p><p>In New York I used to study psycho-analysis. As a result of that, I
became a subject in a Government sponsored experiment to study the
effects of LSD. In this experiment, I was given seven small doses of
LSD, over a period of two years, in a controlled situation. I had
learned how to use it to awaken the Kundalini and bring meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Three times I had a certain experience, which I am sure was Samadhi -
of the variety with seed, in the sixth body, where I became the whole
existence. I would like to describe the experience to you to get your
opinion on whether or not what I experienced was true cosmic
consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>I sat in a meditative asana, after taking the drug, and meditated.
Shortly, thereafter, the Kundalini began coming up the Sushumna from the
Muladhara. I concentrated on Agna Chakra, and all the energy flowed
there. From Agna, some flowed down to Anahat, releasing various tension
knots there. All was very blissful.</p><p>I was aware of four colours: the colour saffron, like my clothes, was
the main one, and I seemed to be enveloped in it. This was mixed with a
yellow colour. Under the yellow was white, still more subtle. And beyond
the saffron, without, was a deep blue. Everything seemed to be mainly
saffron though.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, the Kundalini shot up the spine, very fast and powerful,
and there was an explosion in the Agna Chakra. As a result of this, I
felt that I became the whole existence, and was one with everything. Or
rather, that I had dissolved completely, and the universe, was all there
was. This I experienced with complete awareness and clarity such as I
never had before.</p><p><br></p><p>This state was completely desireless, as all the cravings and desires
had melted away. The feeling was one of perfect harmony. There was
nothing to be desired, as everything was therein one vast present. It
was as if a fog had lifted, and that the curtain of subjectivity called
ego, that usually coloured my view of the outer reality, (thus
separating me from it), was no longer there. All barriers and
separateness between the inner and the outer were gone.</p><p>At that point, I stopped meditating because it felt as if I had
reached the end of meditation and of bliss. It was thus no longer
possible to meditate. My spine seemed melted down to zero tension level.
Everything was perfect love, so</p><p>there was no longer any craving for love. For the first time, love
was not the result of any ego need, as I had no desires or needs any
longer. All creation seemed to be a joyous, blissful light- hearted
prank. It seemed as if the creation wanted to have fun with itself
through its multitudes of energy atoms.</p><p><br></p><p>I then got up and walked about, but though my body was walking, it
was very clear that I was not the body but the universe. The body seemed
to move in front of me and all identity with it was gone.</p><p>I remained this way some twelve hours during each of the three
experiences. Then the body tensions returned, drawing me back to my
former way. However, I had a lot of Kundalini and very blissful
meditation for two months after each experiment, such as I have never
gotten with any yoga practice. When I do yoga and the usual meditation,
it feels as if these practices are taking me in the same direction as
these LSD experiences. I see no difference. Also, these experiences seem
to match all descriptions of Samadhi with seed, or the Jivanmukta state,
that I have ever read.</p><p><br></p><p>My questions then are:</p><p>1. In your opinion was the experience genuine Samadhi, as I feel it
was? If not, how does genuine Samadhi at the sixth</p><p>body level differ, other than it being permanent?</p><p>2. Is there any harm in occasionally using LSD only for spiritual
purposes, in a controlled situation, to help meditation?</p><p>3. Is permanent self-realization possible with the help of a chemical
like LSD?</p><p>4. What do the colours mean?</p><h1 style=padding-top:12pt;padding-left:15pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=acharya-rajneesh-it-was-not-genuine.-it-was-not-samadhi-but-a-chemical-change.-the-mind-can-project-anything-it-likes-to-project---even-an-unconscious-desire-of-samadhi-so-whatsoever-you-have-known-about-samadhi-and-have-read-about-it-will-be-projected-through-the-chemical-help-of-lsd.-lsd-or-any-other-chemical-drug-is-nothing-but-a-help-to-make-the-mind-more-projective.-all-the-hindrances-all-the-ordinary-hindrances-are-withdrawn.-the-ordinary-reason-and-conscious-mind-are-withdrawn.-you-are-completely-in-the-hold-of-the-unconscious.-but-the-unconscious-itself-will-not-bring-samadhi-through-lsd.-it-can-only-be-possible-if-the-unconscious-has-been-fed-with-conceptions-colours-and-vital-experiences.-everything-that-has-been-put-into-it-can-be-projected.>Acharya
Rajneesh: <span class=p>It was not genuine. It was not Samadhi, but a
chemical change. The mind can project anything it likes to project -
even an unconscious desire of Samadhi! So whatsoever you have known
about Samadhi and have read about it, will be projected through the
chemical help of LSD. LSD or any other chemical drug is nothing but a
help to make the mind more projective. All the hindrances, all the
ordinary hindrances are withdrawn. The ordinary reason and conscious
mind are withdrawn. You are completely in the hold of the unconscious.
But the unconscious itself will not bring Samadhi through LSD. It can
only be possible, if the unconscious has been fed with conceptions,
colours and vital experiences. Everything that has been put into it can
be projected.</span></h1><p><br></p><p>If you have not known anything about Kundalini, it is impossible to
feel it through LSD. A person who is suffering from any Phobia will
project his phobia. A person who is under some suppressed fear will feel
the actual phenomenon to take place. So LSD will bring different
experiences to different persons.</p><p><br></p><p>LSD can only be a help to project whatsoever is in the seed form of
your unconscious mind. If it is love, then love will be projected - if
it is hatred, then hatred will be projected. LSD is an expanding drug;
whatsoever is in the seed form will be expanded into a tree. You could
feel Kundalini, you could feel Chakras, and you could feel harmony or
the totality, only because these are the seeds already in your
unconscious mind. If they are not there, then LSD will not project
these.</p><p>The projection is because of LSD, but this is not Samadhi. Samadhi
comes from your unconscious longing. If you have longed for it then LSD
will help you. LSD can be a help to anything unconscious, to be
psychically realised, but it is not a spiritual revelation. What you
have seen is something which you wanted to realize, projected on the
psychic canvas, so it is not Samadhi and it is not genuine. It is
neither; and it is nothing else than dreaming. It is just a dreaming
phenomenon.</p><p>In the night you dream because the conscious barriers are withdrawn.
So whatever in your mind is suppressed, desired, longed for, begins to
take shape and form and begins to be imagined. But when you are in a
dream, you never know that it is a dream. It is so lifelike, it is so
real. It seems so authentically real, that you can never conceive within
a dream that you are dreaming. LSD is a chemical way of dreaming. It</p><p>is not a natural way of dreaming, but a chemical way of dreaming.</p><p><br></p><p>So you can see things which you have never seen, know things that you
have not known, realise things that you have never realised. But all
these realisations are only apparent realisations. They are not real.
They are beautiful; they have their own charm, just like nice dreams.
But LSD can project a nightmare also. It depends on you, not on LSD. If
your mind is hallucinating and is suffering from some untoward images,
these will be projected. So there are persons who have seen hell in
their LSD trip, and there are persons who have seen demons. It depends
on persons. All that chemical drugs can do is to project whatsoever is
there to be projected.</p><p>So do not mistake it for samadhi and do not cling to such
experiences, otherwise they will be obstructions in meditation. You have
felt so much in LSD dreams that, when you go in real meditation it is
faint. It is not so vital that the feeling is not of such a great
upsurge. Compared to your dream experiences meditation will look faint.
This will create a depressive mood. You will feel something is being
lost. You have known something and this something is not coming through
meditation. Then the mind will say, “LSD is better”. And if you go on
taking LSD your mind will become less and less meditative. And
meditation and its experiences will go on</p><p>becoming fainter and fainter. So don't take LSD again.</p><p><br></p><h1 style=padding-left:15pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=ma-a.-p.-it-was-just-an-experiment.>Ma A. P.: <span class=p>It

Rajneesh: <span class=p>Yes it was, but it has made an impact on your
mind. And the impact is dangerous because you will always be comparing.
The comparison will always be there. The real meditation will seem
unreal because unreal has appeared to you as authentic.</span></h1><h1 style=padding-top:12pt;padding-left:15pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=ma-a.-p.-i-cant-find-the-real-difference>Ma A.

Rajneesh: <span class=p>There are so many things. First, the
comparison can never be accurate. It can never be right; because what
you have seen in your LSD trip you cannot remember exactly when you are
awakened. You cannot remember a dream exactly when you are out of your
dream. The dream is again imagined. You add much to it. It is not the
same; because when you are out of LSD, you cannot remember it exactly as
it was. Only a faint feeling of blissfulness will be there. And now you
will imagine the whole experience again. This is not exactly the
experience that it was. It can never be. You have a feeling that you
have known something. That feeling is illusory and you will again
imagine what you have seen, what you have known in the experience
itself. But there will be a blissfulness, because of revelation through
the chemical drugs.</span></h1><p>You are totally relaxed. Your tensions at that moment are withdrawn.
They are not non- existential; they are awaiting you to come back. But
they are not in focus, so you are relaxed totally. The revelation is so
great; you will have a blissful feeling afterwards. You will feel it.
The hangover bliss will be there. In this bliss you will imagine again
what you have seen, what you have known.</p><p><br></p><p>Now this is all imaginary - 90% of it will be imagination and the
greater the distance between the experience and the remembrance, the
more beautiful, the more blissful, it will look to you. It will become a
cherished memory. Now each time in meditation you will compare it.
Meditation will be a faint thing in comparison because it is real. It is
not a dreamland. The progress is step by step. It is not so sudden. It
will never overtake you. You will always be prepared in-between, and the
progress is very slow. It will seem slow because now in the real world,
there is time; but in LSD experiences or in ordinary dreams, there is no
such time, as it exists in our waking hours. So you can dream in a
single moment, a dream that will take years together in reality to pass.
So in LSD, the thing is sudden. It is so sudden that it overwhelms you.
It shatters your total memory. All the tensions are non-existential for
the moment. You are relaxed and the cosmic harmony is felt. The barriers
are not there. You do not exist as an I; and the world and you have
become one. This is so sudden and blissful that you will have a</p><p>cherished memory of it afterwards. And you will go on adding to it
each time you compare it with reality. It will become more and more
beautiful, and the reality will become fainter. So don't compare it.</p><p><br></p><p>Firstly, you cannot compare it, because you are in two states of mind
and the memory cannot be brought from one state to another. It cannot be
brought. Only faint remembrances are there. Secondly, when you compare
retro-spectively, it is the same mind which has projected these
experiences of LSD, the same unconscious mind, the same medium. You have
taken LSD and you are meditating. All the time the unconscious seeds are
there which you can project in your meditation. The second thing to be
remembered is, don't conceive any pre-formulated, ready- made
conceptions. What is to be the result? Don't think about it. To go in
meditation is to go in an uncharted sea. You can’t know beforehand what
is going to happen, and if you know already what is going to happen, it
will begin to happen; and it will still be a projection.</p><p>You can project in LSD. You can project in meditation also, because
the unconscious is the projector. So all the knowledge about Kundalini,
all the knowledge of Chakras, all the knowledge that you have of knowing
must be thrown out; because your ordinary mind can also project it. When
you are meditating, you can project the same thing. The process will be
slow because there is no chemical help. It will take longer</p><p>time but the phenomena is the same. I am not saying that kundalini is
not. I am not saying that chakras are not. I am not saying that there
are no experiences. There are, but you must not know beforehand,
otherwise you will project them.</p><p>You must be completely unknowing. You must be ignorant. There’s a
basic condition to proceed further, you must not know beforehand. Each
thing must be known directly, must be experienced, not taken for
granted. Information should not be made knowledge. So throw away all
information. Cease to know things and proceed as a vacuum. Proceed in
ignorance - you don't know. So everything will be a surprise, everything
must be a surprise. If it is not a surprise then you say, “Yes, I have
known it, this has happened before.”</p><p><br></p><p>There is a great possibility of self-delusion, for the mind is
deceptive. And the unconscious goes on playing tricks! It is not only in
LSD that the deception is possible, even in ordinary meditation, the
deception is possible. The unconscious is the same. You must change it.
You must make it vacant. It must not be a knowing unconscious. It must
be openly vulnerable, ready to face the unknown. Meditation is going
into the unknown. So you need a purge, you need a cleansing, you need a
complete overhaul.</p><p>The unconscious must be cleaned. It must not be pre-burdened - it
must not have seeds. Sabeej Samadhi is a Samadhi with seeds. A Samadhi
with seeds means a Samadhi with your projections. It is not a Samadhi at
all. It is just a name-sake. There is another term - Nirbeej Samadhi, a
Samadhi which is seedless. Only a seedless Samadhi is Samadhi, which is
authentic because there is nothing to be projected. It is not that you
are projecting - something has come to you. You have encountered
something. You have known something new, completely fresh, absolutely
unknown before, not even imagined; because whatsoever you can imagine
you can project.</p><p><br></p><p>So knowledge is a hindrance in Samadhi and a person who is a
'knowing-person', can never reach Samadhi. You must not go burdened with
knowledge. You must reach the door of Samadhi completely empty handed,
naked, vacant, only then the authentic thing happens. Otherwise, you are
meditating with the projections. You have been projecting in meditation,
and you have been projecting in your LSD experiences. Both are
projections.</p><p><br></p><p>You must unburden yourself. You must understand this. Forget all that
you have known. Don't conceive Samadhi in any way. Do not conceive, do
not conceptualize, just go like a child in an unknown country. The
language is not known, there is no one acquainted, everything is new and
you have no guide book</p><p>with you. Only in this way things will begin to happen, which are
authentic. Otherwise this will take a long time, and you will go on,
encircling yourself and the projection will go on. In this way LSD will
be more forceful. LSD will be more vital. LSD will be an experience and
meditation will be something faint compared to it. But if you unburden
your knowledge, forget all these names - 'Kundalini', 'Chakras', etc.,
everything, put it aside and proceed just like a child, only then
meditation will happen. Otherwise meditation too will be imaginary and a
dream.</p><p><br></p><p>The difference is very subtle. It is really difficult to know what
the difference is, although there is a difference. But one thing could
be understood correctly and that is, if things are happening according
to your knowledge, then you must not take them seriously; because they
can never happen according to your knowledge. They happen to each
individual so differently, that no scripture, no ’Guru', can exactly say
what will happen. Everything that is being said is just a
generalization. To no one it happens exactly like that. The seven
Chakras or the ’Kundalini' or the passage, are so different, that they
are bound to be different in each individual. So, if things are
happening according to a pattern, you must not take them seriously. You
are imagining. Things will be different for you. They will never be the
same to anyone else. The happening is individual and there are no
generalizations.</p><p>Everybody's experiences are different and incomparable, and all these
things which are being said are generalizations. Generalizations never
happen. We are twenty persons here. We can calculate the average age of
all here, but no one will be exactly of that age. Average is a myth. It
is a generalization. We can have the average height; but no one will
correspond exactly with it. We can have average knowledge, but no one
may possess it. All the generalizations are myths. They help to
formulate things but they don't help to be life-springs. They help to
make systems, they help to make scriptures, and they help to make maps.
But you can never take a map as a country. You must not. You must have
seen the map of India; but nowhere in India will you find it. The map is
there, with its formulation. When you enter India, you will never
encounter it. It is just a generalization - it helps formulation, but it
never helps experience. Rather, it becomes obstructive. So knowledge can
be gathered without knowing that knowledge is dangerous. If it is
concerned with outward information, it is all right, it makes no
difference; but if it is inner experience, it makes a lot of difference.
Because the mind projects. It makes a lot of difference.</p><p><br></p><p>So you begin your meditation as if you have never heard anything
about ’kundalini', ’Chakras' - just be without this information. Make it
a point - a first condition to enter meditation - that you are not
supposing anything, that you do not know anything, that</p><p>you are ready and open to anything that happens. You have nothing to
compare. First, your information (your preconceived ideas) must go. You
must not cling to them. If you do not cling to them they will go - die.
The seed will die. It will burn. But if you cling to it, it will seem
like knowledge, it will seem as a help, it will seem as a guide. So
don't cling to them and they will become redundant. Then it will not be
a living seed. It will not project itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, forget your LSD experiences as dreams, otherwise they will
be coming between you and your meditation and comparison will go on.
That comparison will be suicidal. It must not be compared, otherwise
meditation will cease; and you will lean over to LSD. Any chemical help
can only create psychic phenomena. It can never be an authentic
realization. Realisation is something to which you have happened.
Realisation is not something which has happened to you. Realisation is
something in which you have jumped. It is not that something has
penetrated into you.</p><p>In LSD you go nowhere; you are just where you were. Something happens
to you because of chemical changes; because your ordinary mind is not
functioning. It has been de-functioned. The ordinary reasoning, the
ordinary checks are numbed. They are put off and the unconscious is put
on. This has been done through a chemical agent. You are not the
controller but the chemical agent is the controller. You are under</p><p>its influence. You are not a free agent - now LSD is free in you and
LSD will work something in you. It is not that you are working, but you
are being worked upon and something will happen to you - not that you
have happened to something. Realisation means you have happened to
something - you have jumped, you have encountered, you have gone! You
are not where you were. You have changed. This change is a conscious
change, with full awareness; and the change is your effort. Because you
have done it, you have traveled, you have gone to some peak, you can be
on the Everest. There are two ways:</p><p>1. That you are on the Everest but you will be in your bed. You have
gone nowhere; and</p><p>2. You can go and the very going is the change.</p><p>The very struggle to go upward will change you and the peak will not
only be a peak of Everest; but will also be a peak of your efforts. When
you have reached the Everest, you have reached the Everest of your will
power. In your dreams you have gone nowhere, you exist in the same
state, in the same time, only something has happened to you. A dream has
come to you. This dream can come in two ways - you can create it through
LSD. That is why they look similar. Both ways you are creating it. The
unconscious must not be a burden - the unconscious with seeds, with
projections, with longings. Only then meditation is possible.</p><p>Another difference: when you have taken LSD, your conscious mind has
gone to sleep and your unconscious mind begins to work over you. But in
meditation, your unconscious is not asleep; rather your conscious is
expanding and making your unconscious also conscious. The light of the
conscious is going into the unconscious, and a time comes when your
whole mind is one. Then meditation has happened. But in LSD the
conscious goes to sleep and your unconscious takes charge of you.</p><h1 style=padding-top:12pt;padding-left:15pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=ma-a.p.-what-do-the-colours-and-their-sequence-mean>Ma A.P.: <span class=p>What do the colours and their sequence mean?</span></h1><p><br></p><h1 style=padding-left:15pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=acharya-rajneesh-they-have-some-meaning-but-the-order-is-always-different-for-each-individual.-the-order-is-never-the-same.-but-they-do-have-meaning.-colours-perfumes-sounds---everything-has-a-meaning.-the-first-thing-that-is-to-be-noticed-is-the-moment-you-go-deep-inwards-your-each-sense-has-got-a-corresponding-inner-organ.-we-have-got-an-outer-sense-just-like-eyes.-they-see-what-is-without-but-when-we-close-our-eyes-they-can-see-what-is-within.-every-outward-experience-is-stored-inward-also.-the-essence-of-it-is-stored.>Acharya
Rajneesh: <span class=p>They have some meaning but the order is always
different for each individual. The order is never the same. But they do
have meaning. Colours, perfumes, sounds - everything has a meaning. The
first thing that is to be noticed is, the moment you go deep inwards,
your each sense has got a corresponding inner organ. We have got an
outer sense just like eyes. They see what is without; but when we close
our eyes they can see what is within. Every outward experience is stored
inward also. The essence of it is stored.</span></h1><p><br></p><p>So all your senses have reservoirs of experience in your mind. When
you travel inwards, these reservoirs will be met. When you come to the
reservoir of colours, you will see beautiful colours which you have
never seen with your eyes. But these are essences of all the past</p><p>experiences - just like a painter painting a beautiful woman. This is
not any particular woman. He has seen so many women. This is the essence
of them all. All that he has seen, all that he has known, is being
depicted in this one figure. Something is from somewhere and something
is from somewhere else. This particular figure is nowhere to be met. It
is not imaginary and yet, it is nowhere to be found. It is authentic
because it has been taken from experiences and yet, it is just an image.
It is real and unreal both.</p><p><br></p><p>Our senses have stored all the experiences, not only of this life,
but of all the lives that have been lived. These are certain essences in
us. The eyes have stored colours, light, etc. Ears have stored sounds,
harmonies, silences, etc. All the essences have their store-rooms. Now
even Science confirms this. They say that if you can touch a particular
brain cell with an electrode, then that particular brain cell will
explode. A person falling down may see stars. The shock may create
stars, if particular brain cells which store light-experiences are being
touched. With an electrode, your memories can be touched. If with an
electrode I touch a cell which conserves your memory of childhood, you
will again become a child and everything will be replayed on the canvas
of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>So when you go inwards, these essential essences will explode; and
you will know many things which are unknown in such sure form in</p><p>the outward world. Outward world is always impure with substances,
but the inward experie- nces are pure essences. There is no impurity of
matter. They are just electrical phenomena. As phenomenon is just
energy, it is pure, and nothing obstructs it. It is transparent. Don't
take these experiences seriously. They are only meaningful as
indications that you are going deep down. But it is only the way, it is
not the destination. When you really reach deep down, and in, there will
be no experiences - neither of light, nor of sound, nor of anything.
Unless all these experiences cease, you cannot transcend the mind. It is
the psyche which is displaying its experiences, conserved through
endless lives. So first, each person will feel different things because
each one is differently oriented, as far as his senses are
concerned.</p><p>Just two days back someone came, who had no sense of taste; had never
known what taste means, so he cannot feel in his inner experiences any
feeling of taste. There are persons who are blind, or colour-blind. One
person in twelve is colour-blind. A colour-blind person means he cannot
see a particular colour. He sees everything else but only a particular
colour is not seen by him. Bernard Shaw could not see yellow. He could
not make any diffe- rence between yellow and green. So he was colour
blind as far as yellow was concerned. He could never see yellow in his
inner experiences. There was no reservoir of yellow colour. There was no
essence of yellow. He had never seen it.</p><p>To him it was non-existential. We do not see all the colours. These
seven colours are not all the colours. We see only up to these seven
colours. Beyond them, we are colour-blind. Below these seven and beyond
these seven, there are infinite ranges of colours. We have not seen
them, so we will not feel them in our inward journey; because all that
is felt in the store-room, is of the without. So, if a musician goes in
meditation, he will know sounds which we can ever know. A painter will
know colours, which we can never know. If Van Gogh goes into meditation,
we cannot conceive what colours he will see, what new combinations he
will know! So this too will differ from individual to individual. There
can be no order. One thing is certain, when you go deep down in your
inner path, things will begin to happen. You will have experiences of
colours, sound, perfumes, smells. These are all stored experiences. The
whole mind is a storehouse. Every cell is a bundle of experiences ready
to explode. Go on, touch it and it will explode! This is meaningful as
far as it indicates inwardness. But it will become a hindrance if you
cling to it. As the feeling is lovely, the mind will long to cling to
it, to repeat it. Then it will be a hindrance to further progress.</p><p>A state of mind is to be reached where there is no experience. Rather
you say - state of mind with no experience; or you can say - a state of
mind with experience of nothingness. Experience itself is the last
barrier. One must</p><p>come to the point where one IS, and there is no experience.
Experience has ceased. Only when experience has ceased, duality ceases.
When you are experiencing something, duality is there. You are there, so
the experience is there. Something without is there. Even if you
experience oneness with the world, this experience is duality.</p><p>So in meditation, there will be no experiences. When meditation takes
its full flowering, there will be no experience at all. YOU WILL BE -
and just being is the experience. Nothing is, except just your being -
your exis- tence only. And when the experience is not, the experiencer
explodes; because it can exist only as a second polarity to experience.
When the object is not, the subject explodes itself. There is no
subject, no object. Only then the existential is achieved - only then
you can say God IS. You are not, and the World is not - GOD IS. The very
ISNESS is God. So these experiences will come, they will come.</p><p><br></p><h1 style=padding-left:15pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=ma-a.-p.-acharyaji-i-am-trying-yogic-meditation-since-a-long-time-but-i-am-not-getting-any-clear-and-basic-result.-what-is-wrong-with-me>Ma
A. P.: <span class=p>Acharyaji, I am trying yogic meditation since a

Rajneesh: <span class=p>There can be so many reasons. The method used
is somewhere wrong; or the way in which it is used is wrong; or neither
method, nor the way is wrong, but the unconscious longing behind the
method is</span></h1><p>wrong. The unconscious must be changed. If you have been using the
method for so many years and only getting shallow results, change the
method. There are so many methods - one should not cling to one method
only. May be the method is not wrong but just not right for you. The
method may be all right, but it is not for you. As far as you are
concerned, it may be wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>So change the method. Change is always helpful. Sometimes one becomes
accustomed to the method, and then the experiences will be shallow.
Sometimes we become conditioned to a method, and it becomes a shallow
affair. Where nothing is new, you go on repeating it as a routine. When
it becomes a routine, you will never achieve anything through it. When a
method becomes a routine, nothing significant can be achieved. So what I
have to say is: if you use this method, the method itself is such that
it can never become a routine. It is so disorderly and chaotic, that you
can never make it a routine.</p><p><br></p><p>All those methods which have disciplined and orderly systems behind
them always become routine. You must use a chaotic method, so that you
are never settled in it. It always remains something new, something new
to be faced each day. So the method I have been talking to you about
will help you. It is chaotic. And for the modern mind, no disciplined
method can be helpful. For the modern mind is basically</p><p>chaotic. It is basically a change in pattern. The old mind was a
non-changing, fixed mind. A person was always settled. Today nothing is
settled. Two centuries ago a person born a Christian, would die a
Christian. Today it is not so. A person born a Christian may become a
Hindu. Everything becomes chaotic. His childhood mind is something else,
his young mind something else. He may become a communist and then some
day, he may come to the Himalayas to meditate.</p><p><br></p><p>Today's mind is a mind which is not fixed. It is in chaos. So all old
methods which were meant for the fixed minds are out of date. For the
chaotic mind a chaotic method is needed. Only then, it can lead to
deeper realms. Otherwise the results are bound to be shallow. Once it
becomes settled, we will be bored with it. And if you go on prolonging
it, it is suicidal. Don’t prolong it. Method is for you. You are not for
the method – change it.</p><h1 style=padding-top:12pt;padding-left:15pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=ma-a.p.-acharyaji-then-i-should-use-only-this-method-for-my-sadhana>Ma

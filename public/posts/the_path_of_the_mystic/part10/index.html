IT SEEMS THAT THE BRAIN HAS THE CAPACITY TO STORE AN EXPERIENCE, SAY, IN A MEMORY BANK. NOW IF THAT MEMORY ENDS UP IN THE UNCONSCIOUS, WHAT HAPPENS? IS IT THAT THE CONSCIOUS MIND REPRESSES IT AND TABS IT “CENSORED” OR DOES THE UNCONSCIOUS DO THE CENSORING? BUT DOES THE UNCONSCIOUS HAVE ANY INVESTMENT IN REPRESSION? AND IF NOT, IS IT THE CONSCIOUS THAT IS CONTINUOUSLY PROVIDING THE ENERGY TO KEEP THIS MATERIAL CENSORED? AND IF SO, IS THERE A KEY TO THE UNCONSCIOUS WITHIN THE CONSCIOUS? IS THIS THE NEED TO GO TO THE SUPERCONSCIOUS BEFORE GAINING ACCESS TO THE UNCONSCIOUS?\nThe conscious mind represses memory contents into the unconscious. The unconscious mind has no interest as far as repression is concerned; in fact it wants to express everything so that it can be unburdened. The whole investment comes from the conscious mind because the conscious mind is in contact with the society, with education, with religion.\nIt is the conscious mind which learns what is right and what is wrong. The right has to be kept in the conscious and the wrong has to be thrown into the basement, underneath in the darkness of the unconscious. The conscious mind uses the unconscious mind only as a basement, and because it\nis dark, once things are repressed there, slowly the conscious mind tends to forget them. As time passes, the conscious mind can become completely certain that it has never repressed anything.\nThere is no way for the unconscious to release any of its repressed memory contents directly. It is closed. The only way is to bring them back to the conscious mind. But if the conscious mind remains of the same opinion as before – even through psychoanalysis you can fetch a few unconscious repressions and bring them back to the conscious mind – it is not going to help much, because the mind still remains with the same idea of what is wrong and what is right.\nSo for the moment, it may recognize what is wrong and may not repress it under the influence of the psychoanalyst, but this influence is not as deep as the social conditioning. Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow again the same repression will happen. That’s why no psychoanalysis is ever completed. It cannot be completed. You can bring something out today; tomorrow the mind goes on functioning again in the old way.\nPsychoanalysis does not change the conscious mind. And if the conscious mind keeps the same opinion, it does not matter if you take out some content; it is released, but life brings so much every day, and the mind will again function in the old way: repress that which is bad.\nThe psychoanalyst says that there is nothing wrong with sex. Under his influence, and under the necessity of being cured of some neurosis, the person is willing to release it, but this release is not going to become such a strong force in him that he will not repress sexuality again. Tomorrow he will repress it again, and tomorrow psychoanalysis will be needed again. And this is an unending process.\nWhere psychoanalysis is missing is that it does not change the conscious mind’s attitudes. It keeps the conscious mind as it is, and in fact if it tried to change the conscious mind, the society would not accept psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis would be in the same trouble as I am. It wouldn’t be a respected profession; it would be rejected. And the church would do the same with psychoanalysts as it has done with witches; it would burn them alive.\nThe society, the church, the state, all are perfectly happy if you don’t change the conscious mind. Then go on doing anything you want to do – it is all play, because you are not going to destroy the old, the past, the traditional... its roots are in the conscious mind. The society has trained the conscious mind, and it protects its training.\nThe only way is to go a little higher than the conscious mind, where society has not conditioned anything, has not approached... which is absolutely pure and innocent. And this is a natural phenomenon, that the superconscious is more powerful than the conscious; and it is innocent, as innocent as the unconscious – with only one difference: the unconscious is dark, and the superconscious is alert, full of light. It can see things in its own light, it does not need any borrowed insights.\nSo the only possibility to create a new psychoanalysis is to bring the superconscious in. Then the conscious mind cannot do anything. The superconscious mind can relieve the conscious mind of its conditionings. It can allow the unconscious mind to release, through the conscious, all its repressed contents.\nAnd the miracle is that the moment the unconscious mind has released all its contents, it loses darkness, it is no longer unconscious. Then you have a great energy which is conscious. Now three parts of your mind – unconscious, conscious and superconscious – are one. And the dominant factor will remain the superconscious. Now it is possible with this energy to penetrate into the collective unconscious. It will still be difficult, but it is possible.\nThe easier way would be to enter first into the collective conscious with this energy. Once the collective conscious opens its doors, the collective unconscious is very easy. Before the higher, the lower loses all power. As the master comes in, the servant immediately recognizes where he belongs.\nWith the collective unconscious and the collective conscious also joining, you have a really great power of alertness, of awareness, that you have never felt before. You can directly approach the cosmic unconscious; it is going to be difficult, but possible. My suggestion is, why unnecessarily go the hard way? That’s why I say my way is the lazy man’s way to enlightenment. When you can go more easily, without any conflict, then there is no need to create an unnecessary fight. Go first to the cosmic conscious; once you have reached there you have so much power that the cosmic unconscious will open its doors on its own. The very weight of your consciousness now is so much, the very energy is so much, that the cosmic unconscious cannot remain closed.\nAnd all these levels have some kind of repressions. The collective unconscious also has repressions and they have gone deeper than the unconscious. When the conscious represses, it has the capacity to repress them to the unconscious, but the unconscious is very close; they can surface in any relaxed moment. That’s why in dreams they start floating up. But the unconscious can suppress them to the collective unconscious; then even in dreams you will not be able to find them. Then some special methods are needed to fill your dreams with the collective unconscious. Carl Gustav Jung has worked on those methods, and in the right direction.\nOrdinarily dreams won’t help because dreams are a very superficially repressed part. The society tries on many levels, and there are a few things which just have to be repressed superficially. For example, your anger is repressed, but it is very superficially repressed – just skin-deep. Scratch a little bit, and it is there; there is no need for a dream.\nSociety cannot repress your anger more deeply because it needs your anger sometimes. In wartime your anger, your violence, will be needed. And for your own self-protection against a society which is barbarous, anger and violence will be needed. So society cannot repress such things; it can keep them just on the surface, so they can be called back without any difficulty.\nBut there are a few things which it represses to the collective unconscious, for example that you should not make love to your mother. Every boy wants to do it, and every girl wants to make love to her father. Society represses it so deeply and makes it such a great sin even to think of it, even to dream of it...\nOrdinarily dreams are authentic and true, but as far as the contents of the collective unconscious are concerned, sometimes when you have a dream it changes it in a subtle way. For example you want to make love to your father – even in a dream you will make love to your uncle, not to your father. That much... because the uncle looks like the father.\nThe unconscious sometimes allows the collective unconscious... if something is forcing very hard to come up: for example, you should not make love to your own sister. Every society in the whole world has repressed it for thousands of years; it is no longer in the unconscious. So psychoanalysis cannot free you of it. Even if it surfaces to the dream world, it will come with a mask: it will not be your sister, it may be your sister’s friend – someone who looks like your sister, but not really your sister.\nAnd then there are the ultimate repressions which are part of the cosmic unconscious. For example, you have been told from your very birth that this is the only life that you have. Only in the East – because there people have reached to the cosmic superconscious – have they found in the cosmic unconscious repressed contents about past lives. It is the deepest repression. Even if sometimes it comes into your dreams, you cannot recognize that it is from your past life. It is just a dream, like any other dream.\nOnce in a while it happens that in a certain situation the cosmic conscious is also trying to relate to you. It wants to convey the message to you that you are living in a false world with false knowledge: the reality is not that there is only one life. It is the deepest part of your mind. But it is very difficult because it has to pass the barriers of collective unconscious, of unconscious, and it will be distorted at every barrier. By the time it reaches to the dreaming stage you will not recognize it.\nGautam Buddha told many stories about his past lives. Mahavira has done the same. Those men are pioneers in opening the doors of a tremendous phenomenon which the whole of humanity has been denied.\nAnd why is the society so interested in there being no past life and no future life, that you will simply go either to hell or to heaven? Why are Judaism, Christianity, and Islam so persistent? Their reason is that once you know that you have eternity available in both directions, then their religions will have to change dramatically. If you are an eternal being, then what will happen to creation? You were never created. What will happen to God, who is a creator? If there has never been a creation, there is no need of a creator. So much is at stake. If they open the doors, they are afraid their whole religion as it is will collapse.\nJainism and Buddhism could not believe in God and the reason is this. It is not a logical refutation of the hypothesis of God, it is an existential experience that our eternal being is a proof that we were never created – and if we were never created, existence was never created.\nWe have been here always. Existence has been here always.\nGod becomes absolutely meaningless.\nAny ideology that is centered basically on God will be very afraid of what Jainism and Buddhism are saying. They are saying each one of you is a god in your own right. Some gods are asleep, a few gods are awake – but that does not make a difference in the quality. One day ultimately all will become awake.\nSo there is no question of there being one god; there will be as many gods as there are beings – infinite will be the number, because not only man but animals, trees, and even rocks have a being. And they are all slowly evolving at their own different pace.\nNobody has bothered to look into the psychology of Jainism and Buddhism, into why these two religions simply dropped the idea of God. It is not a philosophical refutation of God; they have never done that. But if eternity is available in the past, then your life gains a certain individuality: you have to function according to the experience that you have gained in thousands of lives. There is no other doctrine for you; you are carrying your doctrine within yourself. Both religions are not dogmatic, and whatever their discipline is, is based on an inner experience.\nMahavira and Buddha continually repeat, “Don’t go on in a vicious circle. Just look into your past lives and see whether you have been doing this kind of thing always, for eternity. Do you have any mind or not? any intelligence or not?” Just being reminded that you have been after money for thousands of years and you have attained money in many lives and there was only frustration and nothing else; that you have been after power and you became powerful many times, but after reaching the last rung of the ladder you saw that there is nothing – that you have been befooled by the society, that ambition is nonsense.\nYou are not to be somebody. You are what you are.\nThere is no question of climbing a ladder and you will be better.\nBecause these experiences of past lives will change the whole character, it is better to repress them. And when there is the future, eternity, you cannot make people afraid. And all three Western religions are based on fear, that if you miss the opportunity... And the opportunity is very small – most people are going to miss: in a life of seventy years I don’t think anybody will be able to fulfill all the qualifications to reach heaven. There is not time enough. So they have fallen upon belief, faith, which does not need time: you simply believe. You have faith in Jesus Christ, and on the last day he will sort out his sheep and take them to paradise. The others will fall down into abysmal darkness for eternity.\nIt was easy to convert people by creating fear. It was easy to convert people by giving them greed – that if you are faithful, you will attain paradise with all its pleasures. But your personality remains the same – fake. No transformation comes to you through these things.\nIn the East, when they came to know that there is eternal time in the future, of course they could not create the same kind of hurry; they are very patient. Looking back, they learned not to repeat the same mistakes; looking ahead they are patient. There is no need to be tense and worried.\nThis is the psychology of why you find that even the poorest man in the East is utterly non-tense. He may be hungry, he may be dying, but he is not against anybody; he is not revengeful to the society which has brought him to this point. No, he is not losing anything: if he dies, he dies. The next life is there – the journey will continue, only the trains change. Death is a kind of change of trains.\nThe Eastern religions are non-convertive. They don’t convert anybody; they don’t go out of the way to convert somebody. If somebody feels like... tries to understand and wants to enter, even then they are not very enthusiastic. They say, “You understand it; you can do it remaining in your own religion.” But if somebody is insistent he is allowed in.\nOnce the archbishop in Japan went to see Nan Sen, a very great master. He took the BIBLE with him and he read a few sentences from The Sermon on the Mount. He had read just a few when Nan In said, “That’s enough; that man is just on the verge of enlightenment.” In Buddhist terminology he said, “He is a bodhisattva. Whoever has written it – it doesn’t matter who – he is a bodhisattva and there is no need to read anymore: these sentences are enough proof.”\nThe archbishop misunderstood: he thought he was saying that Jesus is a buddha. He had said he is a bodhisattva. Bodhisattva means almost ready but the thing has not yet happened. He is coming near the boundary, he is feeling the fresh air; in his sentences you can see that he is not far away.\nThe archbishop had come to convert Nan In, and he said, “If he is also a buddha then why don’t you preach the BIBLE?”\nNan In said, “You misunderstood me. I said bodhisattva, and bodhisattva means essentially he is a buddha, but not actually. And why should I preach...?” he asked. “I am a buddha; that’s why I can see the poor guy is just close by... trying hard to reach. He may reach, may not reach, because people can go astray even when the goal is just one foot more, one step more. People can go astray: they can take a wrong turn, they can stop, they can think they have arrived.”\nHe said, “I can see the poor guy. He is doing well; don’t be worried, he will reach. But why should I be bothered about him? I am not a bodhisattva. I used to be, but those days are past.”\nThe archbishop was very hurt. First he was very happy that Nan In, a great master, accepts Jesus as a buddha, but that was his misunderstanding. And now he says, “The poor guy is trying, I can see that; those few sentences are enough. A buddha cannot say those sentences. Only one who is stumbling on the path, with all the possibilities – he may reach, he may not reach... But he is very close, so something reflects in his sentences, resounds in his sentences.”\nThe East has a certain contentment, because there is eternity ahead. “If I am not able to reach now, I need not be miserable; life after life will be available.” To repress these things into the cosmic unconscious is to create a certain kind of tension, hurry, greed, fear. It is spiritual exploitation. But if you reach to the cosmic conscious, you are capable of reaching to the cosmic unconscious, and immediately your whole being is suddenly lit with a light which is immeasurable.\nKabir sings, “As if thousands of suns have arisen in me... I cannot count them, the light is so dazzling.” And he is saying it exactly right. He is not the only one; many have used the same simile of a thousand suns together suddenly having arisen. We have seen mornings, but to see that morning of a thousand suns arising within you is the greatest mystery.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHE OTHER EVENING I TRIED THE TECHNIQUE YOU SUGGESTED FOR BEING HYPNOTIZED. ALTHOUGH I BECAME MORE DEEPLY RELAXED THAN I EVER HAVE, I STILL REMAINED QUITE CONSCIOUS, SO IT SEEMS I DID NOT TAP INTO THE UNCONSCIOUS AND ANY UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES. BUT I DID HAVE MANY IMAGES PASSING RAPIDLY THROUGH MY MIND, WHICH I DESCRIBED ALOUD. IS THERE ANY POINT IN DOING THIS, OR SHOULD ONE BYPASS ANY IMAGES AND WAIT UNTIL ONE FINDS THE KNACK OF FALLING INTO THE UNCONSCIOUS?\nSelf-hypnosis takes a little longer time, but there is no need to repeat or say the images, because that becomes a disturbance. You simply let them pass by. You just watch and go on relaxing more and more. A moment will come that all those images are gone, and for a period of time that you have decided beforehand you will not be alert. In that gap you have entered into the unconscious. Coming out of the unconscious, you will feel immensely refreshed.\nSo first don’t repeat the images, so that you can enter into the unconscious. When you have become capable of entering into the unconscious for a period of time and you simply lose track of where you have been – you cannot give any account of it... That time is simply not recorded by your memory, because the memory system is in the conscious mind. The unconscious has no memory system, and the unconscious has no idea of the calendar, the time, the day, the date – nothing.\nSo first let that happen. And when you wake up, in the first moment when you feel that you are out of the unconscious, repeat three times, “Next time when I do the experiment, I will go faster into it, deeper into it.”\nWhen it becomes a small thing to you, no problem at all – you just relax and go into it – then you can do the second part. After coming out of the unconscious, the first thing you have to repeat is, “Now I will remember whatever I see in the unconscious. I will not be unconscious. I will be in the unconscious but a small consciousness will be with me, so I can see what is there.” That will be the second part.\nWith that second part you can start releasing, because some part of the conscious enters into the unconscious. Then there is a way for memories that are repressed to be released. Then coming out of the unconscious you will not only feel refreshed, you will feel relieved, unburdened. Those subtle feelings have to be remembered. First you will only feel refreshed, as after a good night’s sleep. Second you feel unburdened. Something was on your chest; it was heavy, and now it is no longer there – or is less there. Then continue in that way, and go on repeating, “I will be more and more conscious, so more and more unconscious can be released.”\nAnd in the third stage you should repeat, “I should be completely conscious so that the barrier between consciousness and unconsciousness is broken.” When you come out of it, then you will feel not only freshness, not only unburdened, but an absolute freedom – as if you had been chained, handcuffed, and they have been removed.\nSelf-hypnosis takes a little longer time, but it is good. You are totally your own master. But don’t repeat the images, because repeating them, you will not fall into unconsciousness; just let them pass. Your whole effort right now should be how to move from the conscious to the unconscious through relaxing, through being silent, through just witnessing. And everything has to be done in a very soft way – even witnessing.\nIf you stare, that will not allow you to enter into the unconscious. Just see by the way; just as if you are sitting by the side of the road and by the way people are passing – you don’t even care who is passing, whether he is a man or a woman. You just see them because you are looking that way, but no staring.\nSo you have done everything right – just the repeating was wrong. That you should not do. And then slowly, slowly, as I described in three parts, keep going.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU WAS WHEN I TOOK SANNYAS, AND I HAD THAT BEAUTIFUL FEELING OF “BEING AT HOME” FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE. WHENEVER I’M AWAY FROM YOU I FEEL A CERTAIN RESTLESSNESS THAT KEEPS ME MOVING FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER, NEVER FEELING RIGHT WHEREVER I AM. THE MOMENT I’M STAYING CLOSE TO YOU AGAIN THE FEELING IS BACK: I’M HOME AGAIN. 2\nWHAT IS THIS BEAUTIFUL FEELING? YOU ALWAYS SAY THERE IS NO HOME UNLESS WE FIND IT IN OURSELVES. BUT WHAT IS THIS FEELING OF BEING AT HOME?\nThere is no home, unless we find it in ourselves. But if you are close to a person who has found the home and you are open to the person, available, receptive, then you will also share the feeling that you are at home. After all, your master’s home is your home too.\nSo what has been happening is perfectly right. You go far away; you miss the feeling of being at home and you feel that something is not right. It is perfectly as it should be. But it is only the beginning of a journey.\nYou feel at home when you are close to me. Let this feeling grow deeper; don’t let it be superficial. Allow it to sink to your very being; then wherever you are, I will be with you. Right now you have to be with me to make it possible for me to be with you wherever you are. Then you will not be missing; then everywhere will be home. The whole question is one of closeness, of trust, of love... so much that it is almost a melting, a merging.\nThe Sufi story is that Bayazid, one of the most important Sufi masters, used to say to his disciples, “You are very impatient. You don’t know what happened to me when I was with my master. For three years he did not even look at me – as if I was not there. And he was right. Now I know I was not there. Physically I was sitting there, but my mind was wandering all over the world. And I was feeling very hurt. For him to ask anything about me was out of the question; he did not look at me. After three years, one morning he looked at me for the first time. And I know that that was the first time I was there.\n“Then three years passed again; he didn’t say anything to me. I was hoping, desiring – now that he has looked and recognized that I am here, he will say something to me. But by and by that desire and that hope disappeared: that man seems to be strange; he will talk to others, even strangers, who keep coming the whole day, and I am sitting here the whole day, from morning till evening. After another three years he looked at me and smiled.\n“Now I know why he had not been looking at me or smiling at me – it was because of my desire. That was a barrier. It happened in the first moment I dropped the hope: he is a strange man; there is no point. I completely forgot the desire, the hope; it became just a habit to be there because I enjoyed it. His presence was enough.\n“Three years passed again, and for the first time he looked at me and said, ‘Bayazid, how are you?’\n“And now I know why he asked that after twelve years. People ask each other, ‘How are you?’ when they meet – but not after twelve years! But he was right, because only that evening when he called me by my name ‘Bayazid’ and asked, ‘How are you?’ – that was the first time that I was not, only he was.\n“These twelve years have been a constant melting, disappearing. And what a strange man: when I was, he never asked, and when I am not, he asks me, ‘How are you?’\n“The same day my master said, ‘Now you are ready. You can go anywhere, you can spread the word. And because you are no more, I will be with you; you have vacated the place for me.’ Since then he is speaking through me. Since then he is doing things through me. Since then I have no responsibility in the world, no problem in the world; he has taken everything on himself.”\nSo what is happening to you is perfectly good. Just melt a little more, disappear a little more. Be absent a little more, so only I can be present in you. Then you will not miss me anywhere, and you will not feel that you are not at home. Wherever you are, you will find it is your home.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nI HEARD YOU SAY THAT THERE IS NO WAY FOR THE CONTENTS OF THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND TO BE RELEASED DIRECTLY; FIRST THEY HAVE TO COME TO THE NOTICE OF THE CONSCIOUS MIND, WHERE THEY HAVE TO BE ACCEPTED AND EXPRESSED. WHAT IS THE MECHANISM THAT HAPPENS THEN IN THE CASE OF HYSTERICAL PARALYSIS? YOU HAVE TOLD THE STORY OF THE GIRL WHO BECAME PARALYZED WITH THE SHOCK OF HER HUSBAND’S DEATH. WHEN HER HOUSE CAUGHT FIRE, LIFE RETURNED TO HER LIMBS AND SHE WAS ABLE TO RUN FROM THE HOUSE. PRESUMABLY THERE WAS SUCH A SHOCK TO HER SYSTEM THAT THE UNCONSCIOUS SIMPLY DROPPED THE UNRESOLVED PROBLEM SHE WAS REPRESSING. BUT THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TIME FOR THE CONSCIOUS MIND TO PROCESS IT. COULD YOU TALK TO US ABOUT THIS PLEASE?\nIt is a totally different thing. The husband died, and the shock was such that the girl became paralyzed. There is no question of unconscious here; it is all conscious. The shock was conscious, and the paralysis was conscious. The paralysis simply happened because there was no point in living; there was nowhere to go. In a way the conscious mind felt, “This is death.” She loved the man so much that without him she could not live. This flashed into her conscious mind, although she did not die – death is not so easy. But she became half dead; she became paralyzed.\nBut everything was conscious. Nothing was repressed. It was a conscious understanding that now life is meaningless, now this body is meaningless. She simply died as far as she was concerned.\nThe body continued to breathe, and the heart continued to beat – but that’s another matter. The shock was tremendous, but it was all conscious.\nRepression happens only when you feel that something is not right; then you throw it into the unconscious. But for her, what she was feeling was absolutely right. To live, to desire to live, would have been wrong. So there is no repression at all in it. That’s why it was so easy for her to run out when the house caught on fire. It was simply a question of forgetting that she is paralyzed. Now another shock – that of the house catching on fire. This was fresh; she simply forgot the old shock and that she cannot run because she is paralyzed.\nThere was no time: instantly, as everybody was running out of the house, she also ran out of the house. She recognized it only when people saw her running out of the house and said, “Hey, you have been paralyzed for years!” She simply, immediately, fell down on the ground and was again paralyzed.\nBut it was all conscious – not that she was pretending, not that she was posing. The first shock was older; the new shock was newer, fresher – and everybody was running. Just for a moment she forgot that first incident which had made her paralyzed. But the moment they reminded her, she immediately fell down paralyzed. But nothing has gone into the unconscious; the whole thing has remained in the conscious.\nPsychoanalysis cannot help her – only a new love, a new meaning, can help her. Only a new desire to live can again bring her limbs back to life. That too will be in the conscious. All that she needs is something to live for, something that can give meaning to her life, something that can replace the old love and can bring a fresh breeze so that she would like to dance again and sing again. And everything will be different.\nNo psychoanalysis is needed. Psychoanalysis cannot do anything because in her dreams no clue will be found; the clue is apparent, clear. It is the depth of her love that has left her meaningless, and it has affected her body because mind has tremendous control over the body.\nYou can try it: sometimes just put your fingers this way, locked together, and just repeat, “Even if I want to open them, I cannot open them.” Just for five minutes go on repeating, “Even if I want to open them, I cannot open them.” And after five minutes you say, “I will count up to seven, and then I will try to open them and I know I cannot open them.” And count up to seven, and after seven try to open them, and you will not be able to open them. At least thirty-three percent of the people will not be able to open them. The more they try, the more they will find it is impossible: the hands are completely locked.\nAnd it is all conscious because there is no question of the unconscious. You will have to repeat the whole process; otherwise you cannot open them. They are locked. You will have to repeat, “I will count to seven and slowly it will be possible... I can open them.”\nCount to seven slowly, and then without making much effort slowly open them. If you make an effort, that will create trouble. You just slowly open them, and you will be surprised what the mind has done. And if this is possible, then you can create paralysis. It is simply the same process: “My legs will not be able to move.”\nYou can do anything with the body – the mind has immense control over the body – but it is all conscious. There is nothing that has to do with the unconscious.\nYou try with your fingers, and whoever succeeds just tell me!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5672","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_path_of_the_mystic/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_path_of_the_mystic/>The Path of the Mystic</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">10 You are not to be somebody</h1><div class=post-meta>27 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5672 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Path_of_the_Mystic/part10.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND? IT SEEMS THAT THE BRAIN HAS THE CAPACITY TO STORE
AN EXPERIENCE, SAY, IN A MEMORY BANK. NOW IF THAT MEMORY ENDS UP IN THE
UNCONSCIOUS, WHAT HAPPENS? IS IT THAT THE CONSCIOUS MIND REPRESSES IT
AND TABS IT “CENSORED” OR DOES THE UNCONSCIOUS DO THE CENSORING? BUT
DOES THE UNCONSCIOUS HAVE ANY INVESTMENT IN REPRESSION? AND IF NOT, IS
IT THE CONSCIOUS THAT IS CONTINUOUSLY PROVIDING THE ENERGY TO KEEP THIS
MATERIAL CENSORED? AND IF SO, IS THERE A KEY TO THE UNCONSCIOUS WITHIN
THE CONSCIOUS? IS THIS THE NEED TO GO TO THE SUPERCONSCIOUS BEFORE
GAINING ACCESS TO THE UNCONSCIOUS?</p><p><br></p><p>The conscious mind represses memory contents into the unconscious.
The unconscious mind has no interest as far as repression is concerned;
in fact it wants to express everything so that it can be unburdened. The
whole investment comes from the conscious mind because the conscious
mind is in contact with the society, with education, with religion.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the conscious mind which learns what is right and what is
wrong. The right has to be kept in the conscious and the wrong has to be
thrown into the basement, underneath in the darkness of the unconscious.
The conscious mind uses the unconscious mind only as a basement, and
because it</p><p>is dark, once things are repressed there, slowly the conscious mind
tends to forget them. As time passes, the conscious mind can become
completely certain that it has never repressed anything.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no way for the unconscious to release any of its repressed
memory contents directly. It is closed. The only way is to bring them
back to the conscious mind. But if the conscious mind remains of the
same opinion as before – even through psychoanalysis you can fetch a few
unconscious repressions and bring them back to the conscious mind – it
is not going to help much, because the mind still remains with the same
idea of what is wrong and what is right.</p><p><br></p><p>So for the moment, it may recognize what is wrong and may not repress
it under the influence of the psychoanalyst, but this influence is not
as deep as the social conditioning. Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow
again the same repression will happen. That’s why no psychoanalysis is
ever completed. It cannot be completed. You can bring something out
today; tomorrow the mind goes on functioning again in the old way.</p><p><br></p><p>Psychoanalysis does not change the conscious mind. And if the
conscious mind keeps the same opinion, it does not matter if you take
out some content; it is released, but life brings so much every day, and
the mind will again function in the old way: repress that which is
bad.</p><p><br></p><p>The psychoanalyst says that there is nothing wrong with sex. Under
his influence, and under the necessity of being cured of some neurosis,
the person is willing to release it, but this release is not going to
become such a strong force in him that he will not repress sexuality
again. Tomorrow he will repress it again, and tomorrow psychoanalysis
will be needed again. And this is an unending process.</p><p><br></p><p>Where psychoanalysis is missing is that it does not change the
conscious mind’s attitudes. It keeps the conscious mind as it is, and in
fact if it tried to change the conscious mind, the society would not
accept psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis would be in the same trouble as I
am. It wouldn’t be a respected profession; it would be rejected. And the
church would do the same with psychoanalysts as it has done with
witches; it would burn them alive.</p><p><br></p><p>The society, the church, the state, all are perfectly happy if you
don’t change the conscious mind. Then go on doing anything you want to
do – it is all play, because you are not going to destroy the old, the
past, the traditional... its roots are in the conscious mind. The
society has trained the conscious mind, and it protects its
training.</p><p><br></p><p>The only way is to go a little higher than the conscious mind, where
society has not conditioned anything, has not approached... which is
absolutely pure and innocent. And this is a natural phenomenon, that the
superconscious is more powerful than the conscious; and it is innocent,
as innocent as the unconscious – with only one difference: the
unconscious is dark, and the superconscious is alert, full of light. It
can see things in its own light, it does not need any borrowed
insights.</p><p><br></p><p>So the only possibility to create a new psychoanalysis is to bring
the superconscious in. Then the conscious mind cannot do anything. The
superconscious mind can relieve the conscious mind of its conditionings.
It can allow the unconscious mind to release, through the conscious, all
its repressed contents.</p><p>And the miracle is that the moment the unconscious mind has released
all its contents, it loses darkness, it is no longer unconscious. Then
you have a great energy which is conscious. Now three parts of your mind
– unconscious, conscious and superconscious – are one. And the dominant
factor will remain the superconscious. Now it is possible with this
energy to penetrate into the collective unconscious. It will still be
difficult, but it is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>The easier way would be to enter first into the collective conscious
with this energy. Once the collective conscious opens its doors, the
collective unconscious is very easy. Before the higher, the lower loses
all power. As the master comes in, the servant immediately recognizes
where he belongs.</p><p><br></p><p>With the collective unconscious and the collective conscious also
joining, you have a really great power of alertness, of awareness, that
you have never felt before. You can directly approach the cosmic
unconscious; it is going to be difficult, but possible. My suggestion
is, why unnecessarily go the hard way? That’s why I say my way is the
lazy man’s way to enlightenment. When you can go more easily, without
any conflict, then there is no need to create an unnecessary fight. Go
first to the cosmic conscious; once you have reached there you have so
much power that the cosmic unconscious will open its doors on its own.
The very weight of your consciousness now is so much, the very energy is
so much, that the cosmic unconscious cannot remain closed.</p><p><br></p><p>And all these levels have some kind of repressions. The collective
unconscious also has repressions and they have gone deeper than the
unconscious. When the conscious represses, it has the capacity to
repress them to the unconscious, but the unconscious is very close; they
can surface in any relaxed moment. That’s why in dreams they start
floating up. But the unconscious can suppress them to the collective
unconscious; then even in dreams you will not be able to find them. Then
some special methods are needed to fill your dreams with the collective
unconscious. Carl Gustav Jung has worked on those methods, and in the
right direction.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily dreams won’t help because dreams are a very superficially
repressed part. The society tries on many levels, and there are a few
things which just have to be repressed superficially. For example, your
anger is repressed, but it is very superficially repressed – just
skin-deep. Scratch a little bit, and it is there; there is no need for a
dream.</p><p><br></p><p>Society cannot repress your anger more deeply because it needs your
anger sometimes. In wartime your anger, your violence, will be needed.
And for your own self-protection against a society which is barbarous,
anger and violence will be needed. So society cannot repress such
things; it can keep them just on the surface, so they can be called back
without any difficulty.</p><p><br></p><p>But there are a few things which it represses to the collective
unconscious, for example that you should not make love to your mother.
Every boy wants to do it, and every girl wants to make love to her
father. Society represses it so deeply and makes it such a great sin
even to think of it, even to dream of it...</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily dreams are authentic and true, but as far as the contents
of the collective unconscious are concerned, sometimes when you have a
dream it changes it in a subtle way. For example you want to make love
to your father – even in a dream you will make love to your uncle, not
to your father. That much... because the uncle looks like the
father.</p><p>The unconscious sometimes allows the collective unconscious... if
something is forcing very hard to come up: for example, you should not
make love to your own sister. Every society in the whole world has
repressed it for thousands of years; it is no longer in the unconscious.
So psychoanalysis cannot free you of it. Even if it surfaces to the
dream world, it will come with a mask: it will not be your sister, it
may be your sister’s friend – someone who looks like your sister, but
not really your sister.</p><p><br></p><p>And then there are the ultimate repressions which are part of the
cosmic unconscious. For example, you have been told from your very birth
that this is the only life that you have. Only in the East – because
there people have reached to the cosmic superconscious – have they found
in the cosmic unconscious repressed contents about past lives. It is the
deepest repression. Even if sometimes it comes into your dreams, you
cannot recognize that it is from your past life. It is just a dream,
like any other dream.</p><p><br></p><p>Once in a while it happens that in a certain situation the cosmic
conscious is also trying to relate to you. It wants to convey the
message to you that you are living in a false world with false
knowledge: the reality is not that there is only one life. It is the
deepest part of your mind. But it is very difficult because it has to
pass the barriers of collective unconscious, of unconscious, and it will
be distorted at every barrier. By the time it reaches to the dreaming
stage you will not recognize it.</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha told many stories about his past lives. Mahavira has
done the same. Those men are pioneers in opening the doors of a
tremendous phenomenon which the whole of humanity has been denied.</p><p><br></p><p>And why is the society so interested in there being no past life and
no future life, that you will simply go either to hell or to heaven? Why
are Judaism, Christianity, and Islam so persistent? Their reason is that
once you know that you have eternity available in both directions, then
their religions will have to change dramatically. If you are an eternal
being, then what will happen to creation? You were never created. What
will happen to God, who is a creator? If there has never been a
creation, there is no need of a creator. So much is at stake. If they
open the doors, they are afraid their whole religion as it is will
collapse.</p><p><br></p><p>Jainism and Buddhism could not believe in God and the reason is this.
It is not a logical refutation of the hypothesis of God, it is an
existential experience that our eternal being is a proof that we were
never created – and if we were never created, existence was never
created.</p><p><br></p><p>We have been here always. Existence has been here always.</p><p>God becomes absolutely meaningless.</p><p><br></p><p>Any ideology that is centered basically on God will be very afraid of
what Jainism and Buddhism are saying. They are saying each one of you is
a god in your own right. Some gods are asleep, a few gods are awake –
but that does not make a difference in the quality. One day ultimately
all will become awake.</p><p>So there is no question of there being one god; there will be as many
gods as there are beings – infinite will be the number, because not only
man but animals, trees, and even rocks have a being. And they are all
slowly evolving at their own different pace.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody has bothered to look into the psychology of Jainism and
Buddhism, into why these two religions simply dropped the idea of God.
It is not a philosophical refutation of God; they have never done that.
But if eternity is available in the past, then your life gains a certain
individuality: you have to function according to the experience that you
have gained in thousands of lives. There is no other doctrine for you;
you are carrying your doctrine within yourself. Both religions are not
dogmatic, and whatever their discipline is, is based on an inner
experience.</p><p><br></p><p>Mahavira and Buddha continually repeat, “Don’t go on in a vicious
circle. Just look into your past lives and see whether you have been
doing this kind of thing always, for eternity. Do you have any mind or
not? any intelligence or not?” Just being reminded that you have been
after money for thousands of years and you have attained money in many
lives and there was only frustration and nothing else; that you have
been after power and you became powerful many times, but after reaching
the last rung of the ladder you saw that there is nothing – that you
have been befooled by the society, that ambition is nonsense.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not to be somebody. You are what you are.</p><p>There is no question of climbing a ladder and you will be better.</p><p><br></p><p>Because these experiences of past lives will change the whole
character, it is better to repress them. And when there is the future,
eternity, you cannot make people afraid. And all three Western religions
are based on fear, that if you miss the opportunity... And the
opportunity is very small – most people are going to miss: in a life of
seventy years I don’t think anybody will be able to fulfill all the
qualifications to reach heaven. There is not time enough. So they have
fallen upon belief, faith, which does not need time: you simply believe.
You have faith in Jesus Christ, and on the last day he will sort out his
sheep and take them to paradise. The others will fall down into abysmal
darkness for eternity.</p><p><br></p><p>It was easy to convert people by creating fear. It was easy to
convert people by giving them greed – that if you are faithful, you will
attain paradise with all its pleasures. But your personality remains the
same – fake. No transformation comes to you through these things.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East, when they came to know that there is eternal time in the
future, of course they could not create the same kind of hurry; they are
very patient. Looking back, they learned not to repeat the same
mistakes; looking ahead they are patient. There is no need to be tense
and worried.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the psychology of why you find that even the poorest man in
the East is utterly non-tense. He may be hungry, he may be dying, but he
is not against anybody; he is not revengeful to the society which has
brought him to this point. No, he is not losing anything: if he dies, he
dies. The next life is there – the journey will continue, only the
trains change. Death is a kind of change of trains.</p><p>The Eastern religions are non-convertive. They don’t convert anybody;
they don’t go out of the way to convert somebody. If somebody feels
like... tries to understand and wants to enter, even then they are not
very enthusiastic. They say, “You understand it; you can do it remaining
in your own religion.” But if somebody is insistent he is allowed
in.</p><p><br></p><p>Once the archbishop in Japan went to see Nan Sen, a very great
master. He took the BIBLE with him and he read a few sentences from The
Sermon on the Mount. He had read just a few when Nan In said, “That’s
enough; that man is just on the verge of enlightenment.” In Buddhist
terminology he said, “He is a bodhisattva. Whoever has written it – it
doesn’t matter who – he is a bodhisattva and there is no need to read
anymore: these sentences are enough proof.”</p><p><br></p><p>The archbishop misunderstood: he thought he was saying that Jesus is
a buddha. He had said he is a bodhisattva. Bodhisattva means almost
ready but the thing has not yet happened. He is coming near the
boundary, he is feeling the fresh air; in his sentences you can see that
he is not far away.</p><p><br></p><p>The archbishop had come to convert Nan In, and he said, “If he is
also a buddha then why don’t you preach the BIBLE?”</p><p><br></p><p>Nan In said, “You misunderstood me. I said bodhisattva, and
bodhisattva means essentially he is a buddha, but not actually. And why
should I preach...?” he asked. “I am a buddha; that’s why I can see the
poor guy is just close by... trying hard to reach. He may reach, may not
reach, because people can go astray even when the goal is just one foot
more, one step more. People can go astray: they can take a wrong turn,
they can stop, they can think they have arrived.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I can see the poor guy. He is doing well; don’t be worried,
he will reach. But why should I be bothered about him? I am not a
bodhisattva. I used to be, but those days are past.”</p><p><br></p><p>The archbishop was very hurt. First he was very happy that Nan In, a
great master, accepts Jesus as a buddha, but that was his
misunderstanding. And now he says, “The poor guy is trying, I can see
that; those few sentences are enough. A buddha cannot say those
sentences. Only one who is stumbling on the path, with all the
possibilities – he may reach, he may not reach... But he is very close,
so something reflects in his sentences, resounds in his sentences.”</p><p><br></p><p>The East has a certain contentment, because there is eternity ahead.
“If I am not able to reach now, I need not be miserable; life after life
will be available.” To repress these things into the cosmic unconscious
is to create a certain kind of tension, hurry, greed, fear. It is
spiritual exploitation. But if you reach to the cosmic conscious, you
are capable of reaching to the cosmic unconscious, and immediately your
whole being is suddenly lit with a light which is immeasurable.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir sings, “As if thousands of suns have arisen in me... I cannot
count them, the light is so dazzling.” And he is saying it exactly
right. He is not the only one; many have used the same simile of a
thousand suns together suddenly having arisen. We have seen mornings,
but to see that morning of a thousand suns arising within you is the
greatest mystery.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THE OTHER EVENING I TRIED THE TECHNIQUE YOU SUGGESTED FOR BEING
HYPNOTIZED. ALTHOUGH I BECAME MORE DEEPLY RELAXED THAN I EVER HAVE, I
STILL REMAINED QUITE CONSCIOUS, SO IT SEEMS I DID NOT TAP INTO THE
UNCONSCIOUS AND ANY UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES. BUT I DID HAVE MANY IMAGES
PASSING RAPIDLY THROUGH MY MIND, WHICH I DESCRIBED ALOUD. IS THERE ANY
POINT IN DOING THIS, OR SHOULD ONE BYPASS ANY IMAGES AND WAIT UNTIL ONE
FINDS THE KNACK OF FALLING INTO THE UNCONSCIOUS?</p><p><br></p><p>Self-hypnosis takes a little longer time, but there is no need to
repeat or say the images, because that becomes a disturbance. You simply
let them pass by. You just watch and go on relaxing more and more. A
moment will come that all those images are gone, and for a period of
time that you have decided beforehand you will not be alert. In that gap
you have entered into the unconscious. Coming out of the unconscious,
you will feel immensely refreshed.</p><p><br></p><p>So first don’t repeat the images, so that you can enter into the
unconscious. When you have become capable of entering into the
unconscious for a period of time and you simply lose track of where you
have been – you cannot give any account of it... That time is simply not
recorded by your memory, because the memory system is in the conscious
mind. The unconscious has no memory system, and the unconscious has no
idea of the calendar, the time, the day, the date – nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>So first let that happen. And when you wake up, in the first moment
when you feel that you are out of the unconscious, repeat three times,
“Next time when I do the experiment, I will go faster into it, deeper
into it.”</p><p><br></p><p>When it becomes a small thing to you, no problem at all – you just
relax and go into it – then you can do the second part. After coming out
of the unconscious, the first thing you have to repeat is, “Now I will
remember whatever I see in the unconscious. I will not be unconscious. I
will be in the unconscious but a small consciousness will be with me, so
I can see what is there.” That will be the second part.</p><p><br></p><p>With that second part you can start releasing, because some part of
the conscious enters into the unconscious. Then there is a way for
memories that are repressed to be released. Then coming out of the
unconscious you will not only feel refreshed, you will feel relieved,
unburdened. Those subtle feelings have to be remembered. First you will
only feel refreshed, as after a good night’s sleep. Second you feel
unburdened. Something was on your chest; it was heavy, and now it is no
longer there – or is less there. Then continue in that way, and go on
repeating, “I will be more and more conscious, so more and more
unconscious can be released.”</p><p><br></p><p>And in the third stage you should repeat, “I should be completely
conscious so that the barrier between consciousness and unconsciousness
is broken.” When you come out of it, then you will feel not only
freshness, not only unburdened, but an absolute freedom – as if you had
been chained, handcuffed, and they have been removed.</p><p><br></p><p>Self-hypnosis takes a little longer time, but it is good. You are
totally your own master. But don’t repeat the images, because repeating
them, you will not fall into unconsciousness; just let them pass. Your
whole effort right now should be how to move from the conscious to the
unconscious through relaxing, through being silent, through just
witnessing. And everything has to be done in a very soft way – even
witnessing.</p><p>If you stare, that will not allow you to enter into the unconscious.
Just see by the way; just as if you are sitting by the side of the road
and by the way people are passing – you don’t even care who is passing,
whether he is a man or a woman. You just see them because you are
looking that way, but no staring.</p><p><br></p><p>So you have done everything right – just the repeating was wrong.
That you should not do. And then slowly, slowly, as I described in three
parts, keep going.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU WAS WHEN I TOOK SANNYAS, AND I HAD THAT
BEAUTIFUL FEELING OF “BEING AT HOME” FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE.
WHENEVER I’M AWAY FROM YOU I FEEL A CERTAIN RESTLESSNESS THAT KEEPS ME
MOVING FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER, NEVER FEELING RIGHT WHEREVER I AM. THE
MOMENT I’M STAYING CLOSE TO YOU AGAIN THE FEELING IS BACK: I’M HOME
AGAIN. 2</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT IS THIS BEAUTIFUL FEELING? YOU ALWAYS SAY THERE IS NO HOME
UNLESS WE FIND IT IN OURSELVES. BUT WHAT IS THIS FEELING OF BEING AT
HOME?</p><p><br></p><p>There is no home, unless we find it in ourselves. But if you are
close to a person who has found the home and you are open to the person,
available, receptive, then you will also share the feeling that you are
at home. After all, your master’s home is your home too.</p><p><br></p><p>So what has been happening is perfectly right. You go far away; you
miss the feeling of being at home and you feel that something is not
right. It is perfectly as it should be. But it is only the beginning of
a journey.</p><p><br></p><p>You feel at home when you are close to me. Let this feeling grow
deeper; don’t let it be superficial. Allow it to sink to your very
being; then wherever you are, I will be with you. Right now you have to
be with me to make it possible for me to be with you wherever you are.
Then you will not be missing; then everywhere will be home. The whole
question is one of closeness, of trust, of love... so much that it is
almost a melting, a merging.</p><p><br></p><p>The Sufi story is that Bayazid, one of the most important Sufi
masters, used to say to his disciples, “You are very impatient. You
don’t know what happened to me when I was with my master. For three
years he did not even look at me – as if I was not there. And he was
right. Now I know I was not there. Physically I was sitting there, but
my mind was wandering all over the world. And I was feeling very hurt.
For him to ask anything about me was out of the question; he did not
look at me. After three years, one morning he looked at me for the first
time. And I know that that was the first time I was there.</p><p><br></p><p>“Then three years passed again; he didn’t say anything to me. I was
hoping, desiring – now that he has looked and recognized that I am here,
he will say something to me. But by and by that desire and that hope
disappeared: that man seems to be strange; he will talk to others, even
strangers, who keep coming the whole day, and I am sitting here the
whole day, from morning till evening. After another three years he
looked at me and smiled.</p><p>“Now I know why he had not been looking at me or smiling at me – it
was because of my desire. That was a barrier. It happened in the first
moment I dropped the hope: he is a strange man; there is no point. I
completely forgot the desire, the hope; it became just a habit to be
there because I enjoyed it. His presence was enough.</p><p><br></p><p>“Three years passed again, and for the first time he looked at me and
said, ‘Bayazid, how are you?’</p><p><br></p><p>“And now I know why he asked that after twelve years. People ask each
other, ‘How are you?’ when they meet – but not after twelve years! But
he was right, because only that evening when he called me by my name
‘Bayazid’ and asked, ‘How are you?’ – that was the first time that I was
not, only he was.</p><p><br></p><p>“These twelve years have been a constant melting, disappearing. And
what a strange man: when I was, he never asked, and when I am not, he
asks me, ‘How are you?’</p><p><br></p><p>“The same day my master said, ‘Now you are ready. You can go
anywhere, you can spread the word. And because you are no more, I will
be with you; you have vacated the place for me.’ Since then he is
speaking through me. Since then he is doing things through me. Since
then I have no responsibility in the world, no problem in the world; he
has taken everything on himself.”</p><p><br></p><p>So what is happening to you is perfectly good. Just melt a little
more, disappear a little more. Be absent a little more, so only I can be
present in you. Then you will not miss me anywhere, and you will not
feel that you are not at home. Wherever you are, you will find it is
your home.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I HEARD YOU SAY THAT THERE IS NO WAY FOR THE CONTENTS OF THE
UNCONSCIOUS MIND TO BE RELEASED DIRECTLY; FIRST THEY HAVE TO COME TO THE
NOTICE OF THE CONSCIOUS MIND, WHERE THEY HAVE TO BE ACCEPTED AND
EXPRESSED. WHAT IS THE MECHANISM THAT HAPPENS THEN IN THE CASE OF
HYSTERICAL PARALYSIS? YOU HAVE TOLD THE STORY OF THE GIRL WHO BECAME
PARALYZED WITH THE SHOCK OF HER HUSBAND’S DEATH. WHEN HER HOUSE CAUGHT
FIRE, LIFE RETURNED TO HER LIMBS AND SHE WAS ABLE TO RUN FROM THE HOUSE.
PRESUMABLY THERE WAS SUCH A SHOCK TO HER SYSTEM THAT THE UNCONSCIOUS
SIMPLY DROPPED THE UNRESOLVED PROBLEM SHE WAS REPRESSING. BUT THERE
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TIME FOR THE CONSCIOUS MIND TO PROCESS IT.
COULD YOU TALK TO US ABOUT THIS PLEASE?</p><p><br></p><p>It is a totally different thing. The husband died, and the shock was
such that the girl became paralyzed. There is no question of unconscious
here; it is all conscious. The shock was conscious, and the paralysis
was conscious. The paralysis simply happened because there was no point
in living; there was nowhere to go. In a way the conscious mind felt,
“This is death.” She loved the man so much that without him she could
not live. This flashed into her conscious mind, although she did not die
– death is not so easy. But she became half dead; she became
paralyzed.</p><p><br></p><p>But everything was conscious. Nothing was repressed. It was a
conscious understanding that now life is meaningless, now this body is
meaningless. She simply died as far as she was concerned.</p><p>The body continued to breathe, and the heart continued to beat – but
that’s another matter. The shock was tremendous, but it was all
conscious.</p><p><br></p><p>Repression happens only when you feel that something is not right;
then you throw it into the unconscious. But for her, what she was
feeling was absolutely right. To live, to desire to live, would have
been wrong. So there is no repression at all in it. That’s why it was so
easy for her to run out when the house caught on fire. It was simply a
question of forgetting that she is paralyzed. Now another shock – that
of the house catching on fire. This was fresh; she simply forgot the old
shock and that she cannot run because she is paralyzed.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no time: instantly, as everybody was running out of the
house, she also ran out of the house. She recognized it only when people
saw her running out of the house and said, “Hey, you have been paralyzed
for years!” She simply, immediately, fell down on the ground and was
again paralyzed.</p><p><br></p><p>But it was all conscious – not that she was pretending, not that she
was posing. The first shock was older; the new shock was newer, fresher
– and everybody was running. Just for a moment she forgot that first
incident which had made her paralyzed. But the moment they reminded her,
she immediately fell down paralyzed. But nothing has gone into the
unconscious; the whole thing has remained in the conscious.</p><p><br></p><p>Psychoanalysis cannot help her – only a new love, a new meaning, can
help her. Only a new desire to live can again bring her limbs back to
life. That too will be in the conscious. All that she needs is something
to live for, something that can give meaning to her life, something that
can replace the old love and can bring a fresh breeze so that she would
like to dance again and sing again. And everything will be
different.</p><p><br></p><p>No psychoanalysis is needed. Psychoanalysis cannot do anything
because in her dreams no clue will be found; the clue is apparent,
clear. It is the depth of her love that has left her meaningless, and it
has affected her body because mind has tremendous control over the
body.</p><p><br></p><p>You can try it: sometimes just put your fingers this way, locked
together, and just repeat, “Even if I want to open them, I cannot open
them.” Just for five minutes go on repeating, “Even if I want to open
them, I cannot open them.” And after five minutes you say, “I will count
up to seven, and then I will try to open them and I know I cannot open
them.” And count up to seven, and after seven try to open them, and you
will not be able to open them. At least thirty-three percent of the
people will not be able to open them. The more they try, the more they
will find it is impossible: the hands are completely locked.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is all conscious because there is no question of the
unconscious. You will have to repeat the whole process; otherwise you
cannot open them. They are locked. You will have to repeat, “I will
count to seven and slowly it will be possible... I can open them.”</p><p><br></p><p>Count to seven slowly, and then without making much effort slowly
open them. If you make an effort, that will create trouble. You just
slowly open them, and you will be surprised what the mind has done. And
if this is possible, then you can create paralysis. It is simply the
same process: “My legs will not be able to move.”</p><p>You can do anything with the body – the mind has immense control over
the body – but it is all conscious. There is nothing that has to do with
the unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>You try with your fingers, and whoever succeeds just tell me!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

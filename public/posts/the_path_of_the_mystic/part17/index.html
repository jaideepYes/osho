THE WAY I WALK, THE WAY I LOOK AT MYSELF WHEN TAKING A SHOWER, THE WAY I FEEL IN MY BODY – EVERYTHING SEEMS SO DIFFERENT TO ME THAT I CAN ONLY RECOGNIZE IT WITH AN ASTONISHED FACE.\nDOES THE BODY FOLLOW THE MIND, AND IS MY MIND BEING INFLUENCED BY MY HEART?\nMan is not a machine but an organism, and the difference between the two is very significant to understand. The machine has parts, the organism has members. You can take the parts apart; nothing dies. You can put the parts together again and the machine starts functioning. But in an organism if you take the members apart, something dies. You can put them together again, but the organism will not be alive again. The organism is a living unity; everything is connected with everything else.\nWhatever happens to you, in the body or in the mind or in the heart or in your awareness, is going to change everything in the whole organism. You are going to be affected as a whole. The members of the organic unity are not just parts put together, there is something more.\nA machine is simply a sum total of its parts. An organism is something more than the sum total of its parts – and that “more” is your soul which penetrates everything in you. So every change, wherever it happens, is going to ring bells all over your being.\nThat’s why there are different systems. For example, yoga is one of the most prominent systems for those who are working for self-realization. But almost its whole function is with the body, the body postures. It is a tremendous research – the people who have done it, have done an almost impossible job. They have found in what postures your mind takes a certain attitude, your heart takes a certain rhythm, your awareness becomes more acute or less acute. They have developed all the body postures in such a way that just working on the body, not touching anything else, they will change your total being.\nIt is long, tedious, difficult work, because the body is an absolutely unconscious part of your being. To train it, and in strange postures which are not natural, is bound to be a difficult job. You will be surprised to know that because the yoga system found that this life is too short to work on all the postures of the body, to change the whole inner being, they were the first in the world to think of lengthening the life so that they can accomplish the task in this life.\nThe difficulty with the body is, you may have worked your whole life – sixty years, seventy years – and you may have come to a certain state, but this body will die. And when you get a new body, you will have to start from scratch; you cannot start from where you had stopped in the past life. This was such a great difficulty for the yoga system that they started looking at how to lengthen the body’s life span. They found exact ways, which are now confirmed by science from other investigations.\nScience is still not involved in looking at what yoga has found, but working on different things, psychologists have come to know that if you eat less, you live longer. You will be thin, you won’t look so beautiful, but your life will be lengthened. If you eat more, you may look good, but your life will be shortened.\nEven today there are people who eat so little that you cannot conceive how they survive, but they survive longer than anybody else – I used to know a man who died in his one hundred and fortieth year. And the whole process is just to take as little food as possible. The reason is not that they want to live long; the reason is that they have developed a system that is concerned with the body, and the body is our most unconscious part: it does not change easily. It takes a long time, but it does change.\nI have found people who have done almost miracles just by body postures which look irrelevant, because consciousness is such a faraway thing. But just sitting in a certain posture you will be surprised: you can watch how you change. Everybody knows about the lotus posture in which you see Buddha sitting. That is the most famous posture. It has been found now that gravitation has the least effect on you if sit in the lotus posture with your spine absolutely straight and the whole body relaxed. And it is gravitation that kills you; the more you are affected by gravitation, the more you are pulled towards the grave.\nIt became perfectly clear when Einstein declared that if we can find vehicles moving with the same velocity, the same speed, as light, then the people who go in those vehicles will not age – not at all. If they leave the earth and come back after fifty years, all their contemporaries will be dead. Perhaps\none or two may still be alive – on their deathbeds – but they will come back exactly the same age as when they left.\nHis idea was that at the speed of light, aging stops. But that is only an hypothesis, there is no experiment to prove it. It is difficult to find a vehicle which will move with the speed of light, because at that speed everything will burn up. There is no metal, there is no material, out of which you can make the vehicle, so it seems to be impossible.\nBut Einstein was not aware of the yoga explanation. The yoga explanation is that the person can come back to the earth the same age because he has been out of the field of gravitation – that’s why he cannot age. And that seems to be far more practical, far more scientific – not just an hypothesis. Thousands of yogis have lived longer than anybody else. Just sitting in that posture, gravitation has the least effect on them.\nAnd why does eating less or fasting help to lengthen life? The yoga system has found that when you eat, your food is doing two things. One, it is giving you nourishment. That we know; that’s why we eat. Second – of which we are not aware – is that eating is tiring your digestive system; it is becoming older. The more it has to digest the less young it is. Your life depends on your digestive system.\nSo if you eat less, your nourishment will be less, you will be thin – you will not be a Mohammed Ali, you will not be able to do boxing – but you can live long because your digestive system will remain young, fresh, almost clean. So much work has been dropped that the digestive system can work much longer. The digestive system working longer, and gravitation having the least effect on you, can easily make your life one hundred and fifty, sixty years long. And the reason for living long was not lust for life but because they had chosen a very slow vehicle of transformation: the body.\nBut through the body people have reached to enlightenment. They have not done anything but change body postures. In a certain posture the mind functions in a certain way. In one posture it stops functioning, in another posture you become very alert; and you know it, but you have never cared to go deeper into it.\nWhen you go to sleep why do you lie down? That is simply changing the posture. Sitting and sleeping is difficult, standing and sleeping is more difficult, standing on your head and sleeping is almost impossible. If you are standing on your head and you try to sleep... You can make arrangements, you can tie your feet to something and have every protection so that even if you fall asleep you will not fall down on the earth – even then you will not be able to sleep, because so much blood is rushing into your head. For sleep, the blood should not be going into the head with great speed, in great amounts. It should be going less – that’s why everybody uses a pillow: it is a yoga posture.\nYoga has been thinking of every detail – like why do you want a pillow? Without a pillow it is difficult to sleep because the flood of blood remains equal in the feet and in the head. But with a pillow the head automatically receives less blood and the activity in the head slows down. Intellectuals need two pillows so that that big quantity of blood is cut off completely; otherwise they cannot sleep.\nYou can see this happening in ordinary life also: with every mood, emotion, thought, your body takes a certain posture. If you are just watchful you will see that there is a relationship, and the relationship\nis such that you cannot change it. For example a person like me, if you tie down both my hands I cannot speak. I simply cannot speak. I will simply be at a loss for what to do, because my hands are so deeply connected with my expressions.\nAnd you must know that each hand is connected to one hemisphere of the mind, the left hand with the right hemisphere, the right hand with the left hemisphere. They are extensions of your mind. So whenever I speak, I am speaking through two mediums: through words and through hands. Each gesture of the hand helps me to give expression to a certain idea. If my hands are tied down, it is impossible for me to say anything. I have tried it, and I suddenly find speaking absolutely difficult. I want to say something, and I say something else. The whole thing is that the rhythm with my hands is disturbed.\nI have heard about two Jews walking on a beach on a cold winter morning and one was talking great business, offering things at half price. But the other man said, “Whatever you do, I cannot speak.”\nThe man asked, “Why can’t you speak? I am offering you things because I want to get out of this business. I can give you even more of a discount.”\nHe said, “Even if you give them to me for free, at this moment it is so cold that I cannot take my hands out of my pockets, and without taking my hands out of my pockets, I cannot speak.”\nFrom the lowest – that is the body – everything is connected. Yoga has worked on the body; it is a long, arduous process and perhaps has no future unless science joins hands with it and helps it. Then perhaps it may have an explosion. Yoga is one of the most ancient sciences developed by man. It is at least five thousand years old. If science is not going to join hands with it, then yoga is asking too much. Modern man cannot afford that much; shorter ways have to be found.\nIf you are working with the mind... that is a shorter way than the body and the work is easier, because with the mind nothing much has to be done, only awareness, only watchfulness... no psychoanalysis. That is again prolonging the process unnecessarily.\nYoga at least comes to an end. Psychoanalysis never comes to an end because the mind goes on creating garbage every day; it is very productive. You go on sorting out dreams and it goes on creating new dreams. It is so clever that it can manage a dream in which you see that you are sleeping and having a dream, and in the dream you have fallen asleep and are again having a dream. It can be very complicated. And analyzing all this rubbish helps a little bit, gives a little relief, but it is an unending process.\nThose who have really worked with the mind have worked with watchfulness, witnessing; and as you witness the mind, the mind slowly starts becoming silent, stops its gibberish, becomes calm and quiet. And as the mind becomes calm and quiet your body will go through changes, amazing changes, and that’s what is happening. You will see that the body is behaving in new ways; it has never behaved like this. It is walking differently, its gestures have changed.\nYou know perfectly well, just by seeing somebody walk you can say whether the man is homosexual or heterosexual. What does the walk have to do with homosexuality? But the homosexual’s mind changes his walk. Although he cannot manage to walk like a woman because he does not have a\nwomb – without the womb he cannot walk like a woman – he cannot walk like a man either, because mentally he has dropped out of heterosexuality. He is walking in a certain way which is neither of man nor of woman – and you can see it. It is universal. Anywhere the homosexual will walk the same way, and he will be recognized by his walk.\nNow there are many governments making homosexuality illegal, criminal, and homosexuals are thinking to go underground. They cannot go: their walk will reveal them, they will be caught immediately. Thieves can go underground because there is nothing visible by which you can catch hold of them, but homosexuals cannot change their walk. If they change their walk, their homosexuality will change; they are interconnected.\nSo when your mind becomes calm and quiet, your body also starts becoming calm and quiet – a certain stillness in the body, a certain aliveness that you had never felt before. You have been in it, but you have never been in such deep touch with it because the mind was continuously keeping you engaged. It was a barrier, so your awareness was never bridged with your body.\nNow that the mind is silent, the awareness for the first time becomes alert about the body. So a buddha has his own gestures; his walk is different, his look is different. Everything is different because now there is no mind. The body is now not following the mind; mind is not in the way. Now it is following awareness, the innermost quality of your being.\nSo any changes that are happening in the body, watch them and rejoice. Be more alert and more changes will happen. Be more conscious and you will see that even the body starts having a consciousness of its own.\nIn the presence of a master you start feeling a different vibration around you. It is his awareness radiating through his body. He may speak, he may not speak, but his presence... Those who are alert will immediately become connected with the master’s body. It vibrates differently.\nNow we know that you can put vibrations on gramophone records. Nothing is written, there are only lines; certain vibrations have been caught in those lines. You cannot read them but you can listen to them. With tape, the same technology has become even better: you can erase the vibrations, and you can put on other vibrations.\nIn the ancient literature of tantra they have a very strange idea which, in the contemporary world, the Theosophical Movement introduced again. It was the idea of akashic records; akash means the sky. The tantra idea is that anyone who is enlightened creates vibrations which are recorded by the sky itself because those vibrations are the treasure of existence. And tantra treatises indicate that there are methods by which you can listen to those records. But there has been a great calamity. People destroyed...\nJust the way they are against me, they have always been against anything that was strange – and tantra was one of the most strange things. And because it was basically about the sublimation of sexual energy, the whole orthodox mind became against it. They never bothered that it has many other ideas which are very significant. Fanatics don’t care. They destroyed their temples, they destroyed their scriptures, they destroyed and killed their masters.\nThey prevented tantra from exploring its different dimensions further, and this dimension remained incomplete, but I feel there is some truth in it. If existence wants every conscious being to become enlightened, then when he becomes enlightened his record, his vibrations, his words, his silences, should become part of a treasure.\nThe tantra idea was that that treasure can be opened through certain methods, and we can know for certain whether Krishna existed or not, whether Mahavira existed or not, whether Buddha existed or not, whether Jesus was really enlightened or not. Those records will reveal everything. But because the scriptures have been destroyed and burned, we don’t know what methods they were suggesting or what methods they had tried.\nBut my own experience is, that wherever anybody has become enlightened there are certain vibrations still. Thousands of years may have passed but those vibrations are still there – in the trees, in the earth, in the mountains. You can still feel some strange kind of presence. The man is not there, the singer may have died, but his record is still there and you can hear the voice again.\nSo be watchful of whatever happens to your body. As you are becoming more alert and more aware you will feel more loving towards your body, more compassionate towards your body; you will feel more close, more intimate, a kind of new friendship arising. Up to now you have simply used it. You have never said even a thank you to your body – and it has been serving you in every possible way. So it is a good experience. Let it become more intense and help it. And the only way to help is to become more alert.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nFROM YOUR TALKS I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS SOME KIND OF EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS THAT HAPPENS. BUT I HAVE ALSO HEARD YOU SAY THAT MAN HAS NOT EVOLVED AT ALL. WHERE ARE ALL THE SEEKERS WHO DIED ENLIGHTENED?\nMan as a collectivity has not evolved. Whatever little bit of humanity has happened to the collective mass is because of those few seekers who became enlightened. But you should understand the proportion. It is like a spoonful of sugar you drop in the ocean to make it sweet; it is not going to do much to the ocean. The ocean is too vast. A spoonful of sugar was perfectly good for a cup of tea, but it is not good for the ocean.\nAn enlightened man is a cup of tea. Even his group – those who become attuned with him – are still so small that they cannot make much change in the collective mass, in its vast darkness, unconsciousness.\nBut in thousands of years so many people have become enlightened that a little bit of change in humanity you can see. But the credit does not go to man – that’s why I say man has not evolved. The credit goes to those few enlightened people. They simply disperse their consciousness in this ocean – but they cannot make it sweet. It has a little effect, but so small that it is negligible. The credit goes to those few people who lived and died to help humanity. And the same humanity for whom they lived, kills them, crucifies them. It cannot do otherwise, its darkness is such.\nSome slight changes can be traced, but they are so slight that they are not worth mentioning. For example, they could crucify Jesus without any feeling of guilt. In fact they felt relieved that this nuisance is finished. He was becoming more and more a torture to their tradition, to their orthodox mind. They felt light.\nThey cannot crucify me that easily – this is the slight change. They may prevent me from coming into a country, they may prevent me from staying in a country, they may arrest me and throw me out of a country, they may destroy my communes. They may in every way harass my people, but still they cannot crucify me. A slight change has happened. They feel ashamed.\nThey would have liked to; still deep down they would have liked to. That would be simpler. Rather than all the parliaments of the world deciding against me, and every government informing other governments... why make it such a complex thing? But they feel that if I am crucified they will not be able to feel light or unburdened or relieved; in fact they may feel guilty.\nThese are the changes that in the long run will help man, but the credit goes to those few people who sacrificed everything, sacrificed their lives in the service of this humanity. And this humanity has paid them back with crucifixion and poison and stoning them to death. Still they died with a smile.\nMansoor’s crucifixion is remarkable. It was far more barbarous than Jesus’ crucifixion because they cut off each of his limbs slowly. They cut off his legs, they cut off his hands, they took out his eyes. They tortured him as no man has ever been tortured, and still he smiled.\nOne man in the crowed asked, “Mansoor, why are you smiling?”\nAnd he said, “I am smiling because these people are killing a person who was trying to give them more life, more light. But these people are strange – they are killing their own friend. And I am also smiling because they don’t know that by destroying my body they cannot destroy me. They are killing somebody else! So Mansoor is laughing.”\nAnd while all this was going on – people were throwing stones, rotten eggs, just to humiliate Mansoor – his own master, Junnaid, was present in the crowd. And just not to be seen as not being with the crowd, Junnaid also threw something – a flower.\nHe knew Mansoor: Mansoor was his disciple, and he knew he was right. Junnaid had been telling him, “You are right, but don’t say it. Don’t declare: ‘I myself am the ultimate truth. There is no other god; everybody is carrying his god within himself.’ Don’t say it! I know it, but I have remained quiet because my master said, ‘Keep your mouth shut; otherwise they will simply kill you. So what is the point?’”\nMansoor said, “I have been trying not to say it, but what to do? People ask questions and I forget, and what is real comes out.”\nSo Junnaid was sad. He was serving two purposes by throwing a beautiful rose. First, the masses would think that he is also throwing stones or rotten eggs. In that crowd who knows what is thrown by whom? Secondly, Mansoor will be able to understand that a roseflower has hit his face and that it cannot be from anybody else than his master. Only he can understand.\nBut at that moment tears came to Mansoor’s eyes, the smile disappeared. Again somebody asked, “Just now you were smiling, and now there are tears. What has happened?”\nHe said, “Something has happened. The people who were throwing stones, rotten eggs, tomatoes, bananas and all kinds of things – that was okay. They don’t understand. But somebody has thrown a roseflower. I know who he is. His roseflower hurts me more than anything else because although he knows what is true, he is not courageous enough to declare it. These tears are for his uncourageous, disgraceful behavior.”\nSo these people have raised human consciousness a little bit – but the whole credit goes to them. Man cannot behave that way now, today. You cannot do the same to me as you did to al-Hillaj Mansoor just one thousand years ago. Even the people who are against me, in private they are not against me; they are against me because the masses are against me.\nNow, here again the same question arises: they want me to stay here, but the problem is who is going to sign the papers? The president is willing for me to stay here, but he does not want to take the responsibility of signing the papers. The foreign minister is afraid, and the minister of the interior is afraid. He is willing... it is absolutely right, there is no problem: I should stay here. But how can I stay here? Nobody is ready to take the responsibility. They have their fears. If something happens tomorrow, then that person will be caught; then his political career will be lost.\nThe foreign minister is supported by the American government to be chosen as secretary-general of the U.N. Now he wants me to be here but he cannot sign, because if he signs his career is finished. Then he cannot be the secretary-general of the U.N.\nThese people have changed. At least, as far as they are concerned, they are ready to accept me here; just they don’t want to take the responsibility wholly on themselves. That much courage is not in them. But this is also a development. Perhaps somebody may gather courage, risk his ambitions or politics. It is risky, because once anybody signs papers then the whole force of the American government and the Spanish government and the German government will be used to throw that man out. That man should not remain in the ministry because he did not listen to all these governments’ advice and he went against them.\nAnd the people who are all saying yes, in such a situation will say, “We had warned you before. You did not listen.”\nSo there has been a little development, but not much. And the credit is not for the masses themselves. They have not made any progress, any evolution. These are just by-products of a few unique individuals who lived like flames and left their mark on human consciousness. But human consciousness is such a vast, oceanic field that it will take thousands of years for it to evolve in this way.\nThat’s why my effort is not to work with too many people, but to concentrate on a limited number of people with such intensity that they all become enlightened in this life. Perhaps a group of two hundred people becoming enlightened at the same time may give a great push to human evolution. We can just try. And it is such a joy, such an excitement, to try it.\nI don’t think that al-Hillaj Mansoor was angry. He could understand that what these people are doing is perfectly expected. I am not angry: whatever is being done against me is perfectly expected. But this is how evolution happens, very slowly. Existence has no hurry in any way. Eternity is available.\nWe think in terms of time; existence has no time limit. That’s why we become a little worried about why evolution is not happening – because our time scale is very small. Looking at existence’s eternity... our time cannot even be equal to seconds.\nSo there is nothing to be worried about. Changes are happening, and perhaps the days ahead are going to be very, very dangerous. Man may have to change in spite of himself. The nuclear war is a great hope – not in the sense that it happens, but that it creates the situation in which man has to change. Otherwise war is going to happen. Perhaps this big humanity needs such a dangerous situation just in order to change; otherwise it cannot change. That situation is coming closer, and we are fortunate that we have reached here at the right time.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nOFTEN THESE DAYS WHEN YOU COME IN, NAMASTEING US AND LOOKING AT EACH OF US SO LOVINGLY AND RESPECTFULLY, I THINK YOU MUST BE THINKING, “OH GOD! MANEESHA’S STILL THERE; WHEN IS SHE GOING TO GET IT?” AND I FEEL HOW DENSE AND THICK I AM, HOW GRACELESS THAT I HAVEN’T MANAGED TO DISAPPEAR AFTER ALL THAT YOU’VE ABSOLUTELY FLOODED ME WITH. AND I FIND MYSELF WANTING TO APOLOGIZE EACH TIME.\nNo need to give an apology. I need you to be here. Don’t disappear too soon; much work has to be done! I am reminded of a story. In Ramakrishna’s ashram there was a very simple man. His name was Kalu. He had many gods in his small room, and almost half the day was wasted in worshipping all those gods.\nVivekananda – who was an intellectual giant, not a spiritual man – was always after poor Kalu: “You are stupid! What are you doing? Why do you waste almost half the day? You don’t even have space for yourself in your room. It is full of gods!”\nAnd Hindus make gods out of anything. Any round stone and they will paint it red and it becomes a god. And immediately worship starts! It is so simple. The Hindu god is the simplest god. You don’t have to find a beautiful statue or anything costly, just a beautiful stone by the side of the river. You bring it and just paint it red, and it becomes a god. Gods don’t have a face and don’t have hands, so there is no need of any statue. It is only a question of your faith, and if it is in a stone, that stone turns into a god.\nRamakrishna’s ashram was just on the bank of the Ganges. There were so many stones... and not only Kalu was bringing them, others were torturing him by bringing stones for him. Finally the situation became so difficult that he had no place to sleep. He was sleeping outside the room because the whole room was full of gods – and each god had to be taken care of separately; otherwise they became angry.\nVivekananda was making jokes about Kalu and proving him to be a fool. He could not answer.\nThen one day before Vivekananda was going to America to attend a world religious conference Ramakrishna gave Vivekananda a certain technique to meditate with. Ramakrishna wanted him not just to be an intellectual – that is not really representative of him or of India. An intellectual knows much, but it is all bookish.\nSo he told Vivekananda, “You start meditating, just a little bit. Even that will be enough, because in that conference there will be nobody else who has been meditating.”\nSo Vivekananda started meditating that day. After two or three hours in silence suddenly an idea came to him: “This is the time when Kalu must be finishing his worship.” And he felt a certain power after the meditation: “A certain power is here. If I say something – just from here – Kalu will have to follow it.” So he ordered – just silently, sitting in his room – “Kalu, you take all your gods and drown them in the Ganges. Say goodbye to them because their work is finished.”\nPoor Kalu thought that if somebody is saying something to him, it must be some divine power; otherwise who is going to say it? There was nobody. He was just finishing his worship, so he started collecting all the gods. He put them all together in a big cloth and started dragging them out of his room.\nRamakrishna was sitting outside under a tree. He asked, “Kalu, what are you doing?”\nKalu said, “Some divine inspiration has come that I should drown all the gods in the Ganges.” Ramakrishna said, “Stop! It is not divine or anything. Just go and bring Vivekananda to me.”\nVivekananda was called and Ramakrishna said, “This is not right. I have not told you to meditate in order to do such things. So now you need not meditate anymore. I will keep your key. You have to do other things. And whenever the time is ripe – in this life or in a life to come – the key will be given back to you.”\nVivekananda never became a meditator. He died when he was only thirty-three, and the key was never returned.\nSo Maneesha, don’t try to disappear; otherwise the key will be taken back! And it will be difficult to get it back again. Remain here. Much has to be done.\nAnd you will all be getting ready for the day when disappearance is needed. I will be the first to say to you, “Okay, Maneesha, now disappear!” But before that, never think of it again.

SEE MY BODY – AND THE FEELINGS I HAVE TOWARDS IT – CHANGING A LOT. THE
WAY I WALK, THE WAY I LOOK AT MYSELF WHEN TAKING A SHOWER, THE WAY I
FEEL IN MY BODY – EVERYTHING SEEMS SO DIFFERENT TO ME THAT I CAN ONLY
RECOGNIZE IT WITH AN ASTONISHED FACE.</p><p><br></p><p>DOES THE BODY FOLLOW THE MIND, AND IS MY MIND BEING INFLUENCED BY MY
HEART?</p><p><br></p><p>Man is not a machine but an organism, and the difference between the
two is very significant to understand. The machine has parts, the
organism has members. You can take the parts apart; nothing dies. You
can put the parts together again and the machine starts functioning. But
in an organism if you take the members apart, something dies. You can
put them together again, but the organism will not be alive again. The
organism is a living unity; everything is connected with everything
else.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever happens to you, in the body or in the mind or in the heart
or in your awareness, is going to change everything in the whole
organism. You are going to be affected as a whole. The members of the
organic unity are not just parts put together, there is something
more.</p><p>A machine is simply a sum total of its parts. An organism is
something more than the sum total of its parts – and that “more” is your
soul which penetrates everything in you. So every change, wherever it
happens, is going to ring bells all over your being.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why there are different systems. For example, yoga is one of
the most prominent systems for those who are working for
self-realization. But almost its whole function is with the body, the
body postures. It is a tremendous research – the people who have done
it, have done an almost impossible job. They have found in what postures
your mind takes a certain attitude, your heart takes a certain rhythm,
your awareness becomes more acute or less acute. They have developed all
the body postures in such a way that just working on the body, not
touching anything else, they will change your total being.</p><p><br></p><p>It is long, tedious, difficult work, because the body is an
absolutely unconscious part of your being. To train it, and in strange
postures which are not natural, is bound to be a difficult job. You will
be surprised to know that because the yoga system found that this life
is too short to work on all the postures of the body, to change the
whole inner being, they were the first in the world to think of
lengthening the life so that they can accomplish the task in this
life.</p><p><br></p><p>The difficulty with the body is, you may have worked your whole life
– sixty years, seventy years – and you may have come to a certain state,
but this body will die. And when you get a new body, you will have to
start from scratch; you cannot start from where you had stopped in the
past life. This was such a great difficulty for the yoga system that
they started looking at how to lengthen the body’s life span. They found
exact ways, which are now confirmed by science from other
investigations.</p><p><br></p><p>Science is still not involved in looking at what yoga has found, but
working on different things, psychologists have come to know that if you
eat less, you live longer. You will be thin, you won’t look so
beautiful, but your life will be lengthened. If you eat more, you may
look good, but your life will be shortened.</p><p><br></p><p>Even today there are people who eat so little that you cannot
conceive how they survive, but they survive longer than anybody else – I
used to know a man who died in his one hundred and fortieth year. And
the whole process is just to take as little food as possible. The reason
is not that they want to live long; the reason is that they have
developed a system that is concerned with the body, and the body is our
most unconscious part: it does not change easily. It takes a long time,
but it does change.</p><p><br></p><p>I have found people who have done almost miracles just by body
postures which look irrelevant, because consciousness is such a faraway
thing. But just sitting in a certain posture you will be surprised: you
can watch how you change. Everybody knows about the lotus posture in
which you see Buddha sitting. That is the most famous posture. It has
been found now that gravitation has the least effect on you if sit in
the lotus posture with your spine absolutely straight and the whole body
relaxed. And it is gravitation that kills you; the more you are affected
by gravitation, the more you are pulled towards the grave.</p><p><br></p><p>It became perfectly clear when Einstein declared that if we can find
vehicles moving with the same velocity, the same speed, as light, then
the people who go in those vehicles will not age – not at all. If they
leave the earth and come back after fifty years, all their
contemporaries will be dead. Perhaps</p><p>one or two may still be alive – on their deathbeds – but they will
come back exactly the same age as when they left.</p><p><br></p><p>His idea was that at the speed of light, aging stops. But that is
only an hypothesis, there is no experiment to prove it. It is difficult
to find a vehicle which will move with the speed of light, because at
that speed everything will burn up. There is no metal, there is no
material, out of which you can make the vehicle, so it seems to be
impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>But Einstein was not aware of the yoga explanation. The yoga
explanation is that the person can come back to the earth the same age
because he has been out of the field of gravitation – that’s why he
cannot age. And that seems to be far more practical, far more scientific
– not just an hypothesis. Thousands of yogis have lived longer than
anybody else. Just sitting in that posture, gravitation has the least
effect on them.</p><p><br></p><p>And why does eating less or fasting help to lengthen life? The yoga
system has found that when you eat, your food is doing two things. One,
it is giving you nourishment. That we know; that’s why we eat. Second –
of which we are not aware – is that eating is tiring your digestive
system; it is becoming older. The more it has to digest the less young
it is. Your life depends on your digestive system.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you eat less, your nourishment will be less, you will be thin –
you will not be a Mohammed Ali, you will not be able to do boxing – but
you can live long because your digestive system will remain young,
fresh, almost clean. So much work has been dropped that the digestive
system can work much longer. The digestive system working longer, and
gravitation having the least effect on you, can easily make your life
one hundred and fifty, sixty years long. And the reason for living long
was not lust for life but because they had chosen a very slow vehicle of
transformation: the body.</p><p><br></p><p>But through the body people have reached to enlightenment. They have
not done anything but change body postures. In a certain posture the
mind functions in a certain way. In one posture it stops functioning, in
another posture you become very alert; and you know it, but you have
never cared to go deeper into it.</p><p><br></p><p>When you go to sleep why do you lie down? That is simply changing the
posture. Sitting and sleeping is difficult, standing and sleeping is
more difficult, standing on your head and sleeping is almost impossible.
If you are standing on your head and you try to sleep... You can make
arrangements, you can tie your feet to something and have every
protection so that even if you fall asleep you will not fall down on the
earth – even then you will not be able to sleep, because so much blood
is rushing into your head. For sleep, the blood should not be going into
the head with great speed, in great amounts. It should be going less –
that’s why everybody uses a pillow: it is a yoga posture.</p><p><br></p><p>Yoga has been thinking of every detail – like why do you want a
pillow? Without a pillow it is difficult to sleep because the flood of
blood remains equal in the feet and in the head. But with a pillow the
head automatically receives less blood and the activity in the head
slows down. Intellectuals need two pillows so that that big quantity of
blood is cut off completely; otherwise they cannot sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>You can see this happening in ordinary life also: with every mood,
emotion, thought, your body takes a certain posture. If you are just
watchful you will see that there is a relationship, and the
relationship</p><p>is such that you cannot change it. For example a person like me, if
you tie down both my hands I cannot speak. I simply cannot speak. I will
simply be at a loss for what to do, because my hands are so deeply
connected with my expressions.</p><p><br></p><p>And you must know that each hand is connected to one hemisphere of
the mind, the left hand with the right hemisphere, the right hand with
the left hemisphere. They are extensions of your mind. So whenever I
speak, I am speaking through two mediums: through words and through
hands. Each gesture of the hand helps me to give expression to a certain
idea. If my hands are tied down, it is impossible for me to say
anything. I have tried it, and I suddenly find speaking absolutely
difficult. I want to say something, and I say something else. The whole
thing is that the rhythm with my hands is disturbed.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about two Jews walking on a beach on a cold winter
morning and one was talking great business, offering things at half
price. But the other man said, “Whatever you do, I cannot speak.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man asked, “Why can’t you speak? I am offering you things because
I want to get out of this business. I can give you even more of a
discount.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Even if you give them to me for free, at this moment it is
so cold that I cannot take my hands out of my pockets, and without
taking my hands out of my pockets, I cannot speak.”</p><p><br></p><p>From the lowest – that is the body – everything is connected. Yoga
has worked on the body; it is a long, arduous process and perhaps has no
future unless science joins hands with it and helps it. Then perhaps it
may have an explosion. Yoga is one of the most ancient sciences
developed by man. It is at least five thousand years old. If science is
not going to join hands with it, then yoga is asking too much. Modern
man cannot afford that much; shorter ways have to be found.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are working with the mind... that is a shorter way than the
body and the work is easier, because with the mind nothing much has to
be done, only awareness, only watchfulness... no psychoanalysis. That is
again prolonging the process unnecessarily.</p><p><br></p><p>Yoga at least comes to an end. Psychoanalysis never comes to an end
because the mind goes on creating garbage every day; it is very
productive. You go on sorting out dreams and it goes on creating new
dreams. It is so clever that it can manage a dream in which you see that
you are sleeping and having a dream, and in the dream you have fallen
asleep and are again having a dream. It can be very complicated. And
analyzing all this rubbish helps a little bit, gives a little relief,
but it is an unending process.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who have really worked with the mind have worked with
watchfulness, witnessing; and as you witness the mind, the mind slowly
starts becoming silent, stops its gibberish, becomes calm and quiet. And
as the mind becomes calm and quiet your body will go through changes,
amazing changes, and that’s what is happening. You will see that the
body is behaving in new ways; it has never behaved like this. It is
walking differently, its gestures have changed.</p><p><br></p><p>You know perfectly well, just by seeing somebody walk you can say
whether the man is homosexual or heterosexual. What does the walk have
to do with homosexuality? But the homosexual’s mind changes his walk.
Although he cannot manage to walk like a woman because he does not have
a</p><p>womb – without the womb he cannot walk like a woman – he cannot walk
like a man either, because mentally he has dropped out of
heterosexuality. He is walking in a certain way which is neither of man
nor of woman – and you can see it. It is universal. Anywhere the
homosexual will walk the same way, and he will be recognized by his
walk.</p><p><br></p><p>Now there are many governments making homosexuality illegal,
criminal, and homosexuals are thinking to go underground. They cannot
go: their walk will reveal them, they will be caught immediately.
Thieves can go underground because there is nothing visible by which you
can catch hold of them, but homosexuals cannot change their walk. If
they change their walk, their homosexuality will change; they are
interconnected.</p><p><br></p><p>So when your mind becomes calm and quiet, your body also starts
becoming calm and quiet – a certain stillness in the body, a certain
aliveness that you had never felt before. You have been in it, but you
have never been in such deep touch with it because the mind was
continuously keeping you engaged. It was a barrier, so your awareness
was never bridged with your body.</p><p><br></p><p>Now that the mind is silent, the awareness for the first time becomes
alert about the body. So a buddha has his own gestures; his walk is
different, his look is different. Everything is different because now
there is no mind. The body is now not following the mind; mind is not in
the way. Now it is following awareness, the innermost quality of your
being.</p><p><br></p><p>So any changes that are happening in the body, watch them and
rejoice. Be more alert and more changes will happen. Be more conscious
and you will see that even the body starts having a consciousness of its
own.</p><p><br></p><p>In the presence of a master you start feeling a different vibration
around you. It is his awareness radiating through his body. He may
speak, he may not speak, but his presence... Those who are alert will
immediately become connected with the master’s body. It vibrates
differently.</p><p><br></p><p>Now we know that you can put vibrations on gramophone records.
Nothing is written, there are only lines; certain vibrations have been
caught in those lines. You cannot read them but you can listen to them.
With tape, the same technology has become even better: you can erase the
vibrations, and you can put on other vibrations.</p><p><br></p><p>In the ancient literature of tantra they have a very strange idea
which, in the contemporary world, the Theosophical Movement introduced
again. It was the idea of akashic records; akash means the sky. The
tantra idea is that anyone who is enlightened creates vibrations which
are recorded by the sky itself because those vibrations are the treasure
of existence. And tantra treatises indicate that there are methods by
which you can listen to those records. But there has been a great
calamity. People destroyed...</p><p><br></p><p>Just the way they are against me, they have always been against
anything that was strange – and tantra was one of the most strange
things. And because it was basically about the sublimation of sexual
energy, the whole orthodox mind became against it. They never bothered
that it has many other ideas which are very significant. Fanatics don’t
care. They destroyed their temples, they destroyed their scriptures,
they destroyed and killed their masters.</p><p>They prevented tantra from exploring its different dimensions
further, and this dimension remained incomplete, but I feel there is
some truth in it. If existence wants every conscious being to become
enlightened, then when he becomes enlightened his record, his
vibrations, his words, his silences, should become part of a
treasure.</p><p><br></p><p>The tantra idea was that that treasure can be opened through certain
methods, and we can know for certain whether Krishna existed or not,
whether Mahavira existed or not, whether Buddha existed or not, whether
Jesus was really enlightened or not. Those records will reveal
everything. But because the scriptures have been destroyed and burned,
we don’t know what methods they were suggesting or what methods they had
tried.</p><p><br></p><p>But my own experience is, that wherever anybody has become
enlightened there are certain vibrations still. Thousands of years may
have passed but those vibrations are still there – in the trees, in the
earth, in the mountains. You can still feel some strange kind of
presence. The man is not there, the singer may have died, but his record
is still there and you can hear the voice again.</p><p><br></p><p>So be watchful of whatever happens to your body. As you are becoming
more alert and more aware you will feel more loving towards your body,
more compassionate towards your body; you will feel more close, more
intimate, a kind of new friendship arising. Up to now you have simply
used it. You have never said even a thank you to your body – and it has
been serving you in every possible way. So it is a good experience. Let
it become more intense and help it. And the only way to help is to
become more alert.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>FROM YOUR TALKS I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS SOME KIND OF EVOLUTIONARY
PROCESS THAT HAPPENS. BUT I HAVE ALSO HEARD YOU SAY THAT MAN HAS NOT
EVOLVED AT ALL. WHERE ARE ALL THE SEEKERS WHO DIED ENLIGHTENED?</p><p><br></p><p>Man as a collectivity has not evolved. Whatever little bit of
humanity has happened to the collective mass is because of those few
seekers who became enlightened. But you should understand the
proportion. It is like a spoonful of sugar you drop in the ocean to make
it sweet; it is not going to do much to the ocean. The ocean is too
vast. A spoonful of sugar was perfectly good for a cup of tea, but it is
not good for the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>An enlightened man is a cup of tea. Even his group – those who become
attuned with him – are still so small that they cannot make much change
in the collective mass, in its vast darkness, unconsciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>But in thousands of years so many people have become enlightened that
a little bit of change in humanity you can see. But the credit does not
go to man – that’s why I say man has not evolved. The credit goes to
those few enlightened people. They simply disperse their consciousness
in this ocean – but they cannot make it sweet. It has a little effect,
but so small that it is negligible. The credit goes to those few people
who lived and died to help humanity. And the same humanity for whom they
lived, kills them, crucifies them. It cannot do otherwise, its darkness
is such.</p><p>Some slight changes can be traced, but they are so slight that they
are not worth mentioning. For example, they could crucify Jesus without
any feeling of guilt. In fact they felt relieved that this nuisance is
finished. He was becoming more and more a torture to their tradition, to
their orthodox mind. They felt light.</p><p><br></p><p>They cannot crucify me that easily – this is the slight change. They
may prevent me from coming into a country, they may prevent me from
staying in a country, they may arrest me and throw me out of a country,
they may destroy my communes. They may in every way harass my people,
but still they cannot crucify me. A slight change has happened. They
feel ashamed.</p><p><br></p><p>They would have liked to; still deep down they would have liked to.
That would be simpler. Rather than all the parliaments of the world
deciding against me, and every government informing other governments...
why make it such a complex thing? But they feel that if I am crucified
they will not be able to feel light or unburdened or relieved; in fact
they may feel guilty.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the changes that in the long run will help man, but the
credit goes to those few people who sacrificed everything, sacrificed
their lives in the service of this humanity. And this humanity has paid
them back with crucifixion and poison and stoning them to death. Still
they died with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>Mansoor’s crucifixion is remarkable. It was far more barbarous than
Jesus’ crucifixion because they cut off each of his limbs slowly. They
cut off his legs, they cut off his hands, they took out his eyes. They
tortured him as no man has ever been tortured, and still he smiled.</p><p><br></p><p>One man in the crowed asked, “Mansoor, why are you smiling?”</p><p><br></p><p>And he said, “I am smiling because these people are killing a person
who was trying to give them more life, more light. But these people are
strange – they are killing their own friend. And I am also smiling
because they don’t know that by destroying my body they cannot destroy
me. They are killing somebody else! So Mansoor is laughing.”</p><p><br></p><p>And while all this was going on – people were throwing stones, rotten
eggs, just to humiliate Mansoor – his own master, Junnaid, was present
in the crowd. And just not to be seen as not being with the crowd,
Junnaid also threw something – a flower.</p><p><br></p><p>He knew Mansoor: Mansoor was his disciple, and he knew he was right.
Junnaid had been telling him, “You are right, but don’t say it. Don’t
declare: ‘I myself am the ultimate truth. There is no other god;
everybody is carrying his god within himself.’ Don’t say it! I know it,
but I have remained quiet because my master said, ‘Keep your mouth shut;
otherwise they will simply kill you. So what is the point?’”</p><p><br></p><p>Mansoor said, “I have been trying not to say it, but what to do?
People ask questions and I forget, and what is real comes out.”</p><p><br></p><p>So Junnaid was sad. He was serving two purposes by throwing a
beautiful rose. First, the masses would think that he is also throwing
stones or rotten eggs. In that crowd who knows what is thrown by whom?
Secondly, Mansoor will be able to understand that a roseflower has hit
his face and that it cannot be from anybody else than his master. Only
he can understand.</p><p>But at that moment tears came to Mansoor’s eyes, the smile
disappeared. Again somebody asked, “Just now you were smiling, and now
there are tears. What has happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Something has happened. The people who were throwing
stones, rotten eggs, tomatoes, bananas and all kinds of things – that
was okay. They don’t understand. But somebody has thrown a roseflower. I
know who he is. His roseflower hurts me more than anything else because
although he knows what is true, he is not courageous enough to declare
it. These tears are for his uncourageous, disgraceful behavior.”</p><p><br></p><p>So these people have raised human consciousness a little bit – but
the whole credit goes to them. Man cannot behave that way now, today.
You cannot do the same to me as you did to al-Hillaj Mansoor just one
thousand years ago. Even the people who are against me, in private they
are not against me; they are against me because the masses are against
me.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, here again the same question arises: they want me to stay here,
but the problem is who is going to sign the papers? The president is
willing for me to stay here, but he does not want to take the
responsibility of signing the papers. The foreign minister is afraid,
and the minister of the interior is afraid. He is willing... it is
absolutely right, there is no problem: I should stay here. But how can I
stay here? Nobody is ready to take the responsibility. They have their
fears. If something happens tomorrow, then that person will be caught;
then his political career will be lost.</p><p><br></p><p>The foreign minister is supported by the American government to be
chosen as secretary-general of the U.N. Now he wants me to be here but
he cannot sign, because if he signs his career is finished. Then he
cannot be the secretary-general of the U.N.</p><p><br></p><p>These people have changed. At least, as far as they are concerned,
they are ready to accept me here; just they don’t want to take the
responsibility wholly on themselves. That much courage is not in them.
But this is also a development. Perhaps somebody may gather courage,
risk his ambitions or politics. It is risky, because once anybody signs
papers then the whole force of the American government and the Spanish
government and the German government will be used to throw that man out.
That man should not remain in the ministry because he did not listen to
all these governments’ advice and he went against them.</p><p><br></p><p>And the people who are all saying yes, in such a situation will say,
“We had warned you before. You did not listen.”</p><p><br></p><p>So there has been a little development, but not much. And the credit
is not for the masses themselves. They have not made any progress, any
evolution. These are just by-products of a few unique individuals who
lived like flames and left their mark on human consciousness. But human
consciousness is such a vast, oceanic field that it will take thousands
of years for it to evolve in this way.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why my effort is not to work with too many people, but to
concentrate on a limited number of people with such intensity that they
all become enlightened in this life. Perhaps a group of two hundred
people becoming enlightened at the same time may give a great push to
human evolution. We can just try. And it is such a joy, such an
excitement, to try it.</p><p>I don’t think that al-Hillaj Mansoor was angry. He could understand
that what these people are doing is perfectly expected. I am not angry:
whatever is being done against me is perfectly expected. But this is how
evolution happens, very slowly. Existence has no hurry in any way.
Eternity is available.</p><p><br></p><p>We think in terms of time; existence has no time limit. That’s why we
become a little worried about why evolution is not happening – because
our time scale is very small. Looking at existence’s eternity... our
time cannot even be equal to seconds.</p><p><br></p><p>So there is nothing to be worried about. Changes are happening, and
perhaps the days ahead are going to be very, very dangerous. Man may
have to change in spite of himself. The nuclear war is a great hope –
not in the sense that it happens, but that it creates the situation in
which man has to change. Otherwise war is going to happen. Perhaps this
big humanity needs such a dangerous situation just in order to change;
otherwise it cannot change. That situation is coming closer, and we are
fortunate that we have reached here at the right time.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>OFTEN THESE DAYS WHEN YOU COME IN, NAMASTEING US AND LOOKING AT EACH
OF US SO LOVINGLY AND RESPECTFULLY, I THINK YOU MUST BE THINKING, “OH
GOD! MANEESHA’S STILL THERE; WHEN IS SHE GOING TO GET IT?” AND I FEEL
HOW DENSE AND THICK I AM, HOW GRACELESS THAT I HAVEN’T MANAGED TO
DISAPPEAR AFTER ALL THAT YOU’VE ABSOLUTELY FLOODED ME WITH. AND I FIND
MYSELF WANTING TO APOLOGIZE EACH TIME.</p><p><br></p><p>No need to give an apology. I need you to be here. Don’t disappear
too soon; much work has to be done! I am reminded of a story. In
Ramakrishna’s ashram there was a very simple man. His name was Kalu. He
had many gods in his small room, and almost half the day was wasted in
worshipping all those gods.</p><p><br></p><p>Vivekananda – who was an intellectual giant, not a spiritual man –
was always after poor Kalu: “You are stupid! What are you doing? Why do
you waste almost half the day? You don’t even have space for yourself in
your room. It is full of gods!”</p><p><br></p><p>And Hindus make gods out of anything. Any round stone and they will
paint it red and it becomes a god. And immediately worship starts! It is
so simple. The Hindu god is the simplest god. You don’t have to find a
beautiful statue or anything costly, just a beautiful stone by the side
of the river. You bring it and just paint it red, and it becomes a god.
Gods don’t have a face and don’t have hands, so there is no need of any
statue. It is only a question of your faith, and if it is in a stone,
that stone turns into a god.</p><p><br></p><p>Ramakrishna’s ashram was just on the bank of the Ganges. There were
so many stones... and not only Kalu was bringing them, others were
torturing him by bringing stones for him. Finally the situation became
so difficult that he had no place to sleep. He was sleeping outside the
room because the whole room was full of gods – and each god had to be
taken care of separately; otherwise they became angry.</p><p>Vivekananda was making jokes about Kalu and proving him to be a fool.
He could not answer.</p><p><br></p><p>Then one day before Vivekananda was going to America to attend a
world religious conference Ramakrishna gave Vivekananda a certain
technique to meditate with. Ramakrishna wanted him not just to be an
intellectual – that is not really representative of him or of India. An
intellectual knows much, but it is all bookish.</p><p><br></p><p>So he told Vivekananda, “You start meditating, just a little bit.
Even that will be enough, because in that conference there will be
nobody else who has been meditating.”</p><p><br></p><p>So Vivekananda started meditating that day. After two or three hours
in silence suddenly an idea came to him: “This is the time when Kalu
must be finishing his worship.” And he felt a certain power after the
meditation: “A certain power is here. If I say something – just from
here – Kalu will have to follow it.” So he ordered – just silently,
sitting in his room – “Kalu, you take all your gods and drown them in
the Ganges. Say goodbye to them because their work is finished.”</p><p><br></p><p>Poor Kalu thought that if somebody is saying something to him, it
must be some divine power; otherwise who is going to say it? There was
nobody. He was just finishing his worship, so he started collecting all
the gods. He put them all together in a big cloth and started dragging
them out of his room.</p><p><br></p><p>Ramakrishna was sitting outside under a tree. He asked, “Kalu, what
are you doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>Kalu said, “Some divine inspiration has come that I should drown all
the gods in the Ganges.” Ramakrishna said, “Stop! It is not divine or
anything. Just go and bring Vivekananda to me.”</p><p>Vivekananda was called and Ramakrishna said, “This is not right. I
have not told you to meditate in order to do such things. So now you
need not meditate anymore. I will keep your key. You have to do other
things. And whenever the time is ripe – in this life or in a life to
come – the key will be given back to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Vivekananda never became a meditator. He died when he was only
thirty-three, and the key was never returned.</p><p><br></p><p>So Maneesha, don’t try to disappear; otherwise the key will be taken
back! And it will be difficult to get it back again. Remain here. Much
has to be done.</p><p><br></p><p>And you will all be getting ready for the day when disappearance is
needed. I will be the first to say to you, “Okay, Maneesha, now
disappear!” But before that, never think of it again. Okay?</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part16>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

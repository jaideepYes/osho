THEN I THOUGHT YOU REALLY MEANT TO SIT SILENTLY – AND I FELT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. NOW, SITTING SILENTLY IN YOUR PRESENCE, DOING NOTHING I FIND IS PURE HEDONISM – AND THE GRASS IS GROWING BY ITSELF. BELOVED MASTER, I AM AMAZED, AND MY GRATITUDE IS BEYOND WORDS.\nThe East and the West have gone so far away from each other that there is always misunderstanding: neither the East understands the West nor the West understands the East. But in the final reckoning, the West is the loser.\nFor ten thousand years the East has chosen a path which is not of the mind – which is not intellectual, which is not rational, which is not logical, which is not scientific. And the West has chosen just the opposite.\nThe West is still far away from reaching the final heights of rational flight. And perhaps it will never be able to reach the end, because its enquiry is about the objects outside you. There is an infinity of universe, and the deeper science goes the more it finds that it knows nothing. Its knowledge only helps it to know that much more is to be known and there seems to be no end in view.\nOn the other hand, the East has reached its goal: it has attained to the ultimate consciousness. In a certain way, it has reached inner perfection. This creates new difficulties of misunderstanding, because the East speaks from the heights of final realization and the West can understand only relative truths which are changing every day.\nThey have also chosen to speak in different ways. The East speaks in poetic metaphors; the West speaks in terms of mathematics. The East speaks intuitively; the West, only intellectually.\nIt is one of the greatest problems to be solved – how East and West can come together. Their meeting is absolutely necessary; otherwise, whatever has been attained in the East, or in the West, will all disappear into nuclear smoke.\nI can understand Kaveesha’s question. When she first heard the famous haiku – “Sitting silently, doing nothing, the spring comes and the grass grows by itself” – it was natural for her to understand it as poetry, as metaphoric expression. The mind trained in the Western way cannot think otherwise. It is impossible to think this is a description of a reality.\nThere is no metaphor involved. It is not poetry. Haiku is not poetry. Its formation is poetic, but what it contains is reality. Only its container is poetic, but the content is absolute reality.\nBut it is difficult, for the simple reason... first, sitting silently is against the Western mind. The West has the proverb, “The empty mind is the devil’s workshop.” Sitting silently, you will be empty. And from your childhood you have heard that the empty mind is the devil’s workshop. The East knows something totally different. It is a workshop – not of the devil but of the divine.\nThe first sentence creates great hurdles. Everybody in the West is taught to think, and thinking pays in life – sitting silently won’t pay. It is not a qualification; maybe it can be called a DISqualification. If you apply for a job and tell the employer that your qualification is sitting silently, doing nothing, the spring comes and the grass grows by itself, he will be simply amazed! They will simply throw you out of the office – “You sit somewhere else, because we don’t want the grass to grow here!” In their eyes, you must be mad.\nThe West has never developed any meditation – it is poor in that way, very poor. It knows only prayer, which is not even a faraway echo of meditation. Even the so-called prophets and saviors and messiahs have never been able to go beyond prayer – prayer is the last thing, because God is the ultimate goal.\nMeditation is a revolution in religion.\nIt simply drops God, without even arguing against it. It is not even worthy of that, because it is a hypothesis – unproved, unexperienced; it does not deserve to be considered.\nI had a friend, Professor Wilson, who was teaching in a theological college in Jabalpur. He could not understand that there can be a religion which has no God, which has no prayer. The West, for the last four or five centuries, has never conceived that religion is possible without God, without prayer. In fact it is only possible without them. They are the disturbances, obstructions on the way to religious revolution. They are the enemies.\nThe devil has not done any wrong in the world – he does not exist. God also does not exist, but he has done immense harm. God has kept man’s mind focused on something outside, and when you are focused on the outside, you remain in the mind. Meditation cannot be focused outside; only mind has the capacity to be focused outside. Mind cannot be focused inside; only meditation can do that. So meditation and mind go diametrically opposite ways.\nIt is not without reason that people of meditation have called their path the path of no-mind. But with the mind being dropped, gods, all kinds of theologies, devils, heaven and hell and their details, the ideas of sin and virtue – they are all dropped because they are all part of the mind. And the West has remained mind-obsessed – as if you are only mind and nothing more, your existence consists of mind-body, and that’s all.\nTrained in the Western ways, Kaveesha thought that it must be some metaphor, or perhaps there is some meaning in it. ‘Meaning’ is a mind word: if there is some meaning in it, then think about the meaning, find out the meaning of it.\nYou cannot find any meaning in it. It comes from an inner source of your being, where meaning itself has no meaning, where things simply are – with great splendor, with tremendous beauty, but no meaning. Meaning is a logical concept, and logic is a mind product. Existence knows nothing about it.\nSo first she thought it may be a metaphor. Obviously, this will come to the Western mind. But a metaphor also has to have some meaning. It must indicate towards something; it must be a metaphor for something, a representative, a pointer. But what meaning is there? Seen with an attitude which is searching for meaning, the haiku is meaningless. It is an experience. And it actually describes everything that happens to consciousness – just in those few words.\nAnd that is the beauty of haiku. It uses the minimal amount of words. You cannot take a single word out of it, it has been already taken: only the most essential has been left.\nSitting silently – there are two words. It starts with sitting, it starts with the body. If the body can sit restfully, relaxed, it helps immensely for the mind to become silent. If the body is restless, tense, then the mind cannot be silent. So the haiku is starting from the very foundation: “sitting” simply means relaxed, restful, at ease, at home, no tensions.\nYou see millions of statues of Buddha all over Asia – and Buddha himself said before he died, “Don’t make a statue of me.” For almost three hundred years the disciples, generation after generation, resisted the temptation. But as the physical presence of Buddha became far away – four hundred years, five hundred years – the temptation to have at least a marble statue sitting in the same posture as Buddha... It does not matter whether it is a photographic representation or not; that is irrelevant. What matters is that it will help to give you inspiration, understanding of how to sit.\nAnd for that, the marble statue is even better than a real Buddha, because it is completely relaxed – no tensions, no movement. They gave it such proportion, such beauty, such aesthetic sensibility, that if you sit by the side of a Buddha statue, you would like to sit in the same way. And the miracle you will feel is that as you start sitting in the same way, the mind starts settling... as if the evening has come and the birds are coming back to their homes, to their trees. Soon it will be night and all the birds will have settled in their nests, fallen asleep.\nAnd if you are fortunate to be in the presence of a living, awakened being, his restful body will create a synchronicity with your bodies, because it is of the same matter. All bodies are made of the same matter and function on the same wavelength.\nIf the sitting is right, silence descends on you just as the evening comes and then all becomes dark.\nSitting silently... The second thing is the mind. The body should be non-tense, and the mind should be without any thought.\nSitting silently, doing nothing... This is very significant to understand. Even the idea that you are doing meditation is a disturbance, because every “doing” makes the mind active. Mind can remain passive only when you are in a state of non-doing, doing nothing...\nThis small haiku contains the whole philosophy of the Eastern approach. It is not even a meditation; you are not doing anything, you are simply rejoicing in rest. You are enjoying the peace that comes on its own, it is not your doing. You are simply waiting, not doing... waiting for things to happen. There is no hurry, there is no worry.\nTHE SPRING COMES... Remember, existence has no obligation to fulfill your desires; hence, the sentence, THE SPRING COMES... You may be in a different season, and the grass may not grow. Don’t complain that “I was sitting silently and the grass was not growing.” You were out of tune with existence.\nYou have to follow existence. The spring comes – you have to wait for the spring to come, you cannot bring it, you cannot manufacture it; it is not in your hands. The spring comes – it comes – and the grass grows by itself. And suddenly everything becomes green; suddenly, everywhere grass is growing. Nobody is doing anything, just the spring has come and its coming is enough for the grass to grow.\nYou are sitting silently, doing nothing, simply waiting for the spring to come. Just as the outside spring comes, the inside spring also comes. There are inner seasons of life. So don’t be worried – the spring is bound to come.\nAnd at the time the haiku was written, the spring used to come exactly the same day every year; for centuries that had been the routine. In my childhood in India, every season was coming exactly on the same day. There was no question about what day the rains would begin, on what day the rains would end. But because of atomic explosions... they have disturbed the whole ecology. Now nothing is certain: sometimes rains come, sometimes they don’t come at all; sometimes they come too much, too early. The old rhythm, the old balance, is there no more.\nBut fortunately, atomic explosions cannot disturb your inner world. They cannot reach there. There, the spring comes exactly when you are ready. The Egyptian saying is, “When the disciple is ready, the master appears.” The master has to appear when the disciple is ready. The disciple need not worry about the master, he has just to be ready. His readiness is enough to give a call to the master.\nAnd it is absolutely true: the master appears when the disciple is ready. Sitting silently, doing nothing, you are getting ready. No desire, no worry whether the spring will come or not – it always comes, it has never been otherwise. The moment you are ready, it is there.\nAnd when the spring comes to your inner world, as if thousands of flowers have opened up, the whole air changes: it is fresh and fragrant, the birds start singing. Your inner world becomes a music unto itself, a fragrance unto itself – and the grass grows by itself.\nBy “the grass” is indicated your life, your life force. Green is the symbol for the living. In connection with spring, everything becomes green. And once you have experienced this phenomenon, you have known the greatest secret there is – that there are things which you cannot do, but can only allow to happen.\nSo it is possible, Kaveesha: sitting here just doing nothing, the spring may come at any moment, and for the first time you will understand the significance of the haiku, because something in you starts growing, so alive – it is pure life. It is you, it is your being. But there is no way to intellectually understand it.\nIn the East for thousands of years, disciples have been sitting by the side of the master, just doing nothing. It looks strange to the Western mind: what is the point of sitting there? If you go to a Sufi gathering, the master is sitting in the middle and all around his disciples are sitting silently – nothing is happening, the master is not even saying anything. Hours pass...\nBut something transpires – they all feel a fulfillment. When they come out, they are radiant. The master has not done anything; neither have they done anything. They just fall in tune because both were not doing anything, both were silent.\nIt is possible that now you understand the haiku. Sitting here every day, just listening to me, a silence descends on you and suddenly there is spring and the grass is growing.\nThe East has to be understood in its own ways. If somebody tries to interpret it intellectually, he has missed the point from the very beginning.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nTO ME, YOUR DISCOURSES FEEL LIKE AN INSIDE DEEP CLEANING. WHATEVER LOAD OF PAIN, ANGER, OR ANY NEGATIVE FEELING I CARRY WITH ME WHEN I COME INTO DISCOURSE, IT HAS DISAPPEARED WHEN I WALK OUT, AND I FEEL LIGHT AND REFRESHED. SOMETIMES, IT DOESN’T TAKE ME LONG TO CREATE ANOTHER ONE, BUT I KNOW IT IS NOT GOING TO LAST LONGER THAN THE END OF THE NEXT DISCOURSE. WHEN AWAY FROM YOU, ALTHOUGH I USED TO MEDITATE EVERY DAY, THINGS WERE TAKING MUCH LONGER TO DISAPPEAR. CAN YOU COMMENT?\nIt is the same thing... Away from me you were trying to meditate, and that doer was your disturbance. With me... I am not even telling you to meditate. I am just talking to you and creating a certain atmosphere in which meditation happens to you.\nSo while you are here, see the difference between doing and happening. Alone also, let it happen. If you become accustomed to my voice, perhaps you can put on the tape recorder: forget about\nmeditation; you just listen and the meditation will come. And, slowly slowly, this coming of meditation can be detached from listening to me.\nYou can sit by the side of the sea and listen to the waves crashing on the shore – so joyfully, so dancingly they come, and they have been doing that for millennia and they are not tired yet. Just listen to them. Or sitting under a tree, just listen to the birds, or the wind blowing through the tree.\nSlowly slowly, get rid of listening too. Just sit silently – because that listening was only a device. This is only a device to help you avoid doing. But the device is only for the beginning; soon you have to drop the device and it will be happening anywhere you are, and it will cleanse you the same way it does here.\nAnd remember one thing: if it cleanses you, that does not mean you have to be careless about collecting the garbage again because you know in meditation it will be cleaned away. You are using meditation for a very small job. It is not meant for that.\nI have heard – it happened in Burma after the second world war – a small airplane was left in the forest. The Japanese were surrendering, but a few stubborn samurais still wanted to fight, so they escaped in an airplane. Then they left the airplane in the forest, and were hiding somewhere in the forest.\nBut a tribe lived there, a very ancient tribe. They had seen airplanes in the sky, but they could not connect the two things, that this was the same thing they had called “the great bird.” They tried to figure it out: “What is it? It has wheels, so one thing is certain, it is a vehicle.”\nThey used it with two horses as a bullock cart. And it was working well and they were very happy: “This is great!” Then somebody who had been to the city, said, “You don’t know – this is not a bullock cart, it is a car. Just... I don’t understand why these wings are there, but let me try...” And he tried, and it started.\nThen they started using it as a car, and the man suggested, “You will need fuel, so somebody who goes to the city should bring fuel. No horses, no bullocks are needed, just fill it with fuel and use it as a car.” And they were immensely happy.\nThen a man who had been in the army passed by and he said, “What are you doing! You are using a small aircraft as a car? This can fly.”\nThey could not believe it. They asked, “Is it a great bird?”\nHe said, “Yes,” and he was a pilot, so he showed them how to fly it.\nMeditation can be used as a bullock cart – and that’s how you are using it, just cleaning the rubbish that you accumulate. But you will accumulate that rubbish every day and you will have to clean it every day. Meditation is a great bird, and you are using it for something it is not meant for, although it can do that work too.\nSo when it cleanses your burden, be careful not to collect it again. What is the need to collect the burden? – just unawareness. And what you collect is all rubbish. You know it – that’s why, when\nthrough meditation it is cleaned away, you feel fresh. So why destroy your freshness? Don’t collect it. And the way is to be more alert, to be more meditative, even while you are doing other things. It is a great defense, it won’t allow any rubbish to collect. And slowly slowly, you will be collecting less, and one day you will find, between two meditations, that you have not collected anything.\nNow the bullock cart can become a motor car – and there is a great distance between the two. Now you don’t need the bullocks or the horses to carry it, and it can go faster. Now you have speed; otherwise, you can do the same thing every day and you will die the same.\nAnd when there is nothing else to cleanse, then the meditation, your energy, starts rising up because there is no work on the ground. You can take off. You can become a bird in the inner sky. Then it will not be only refreshing, it will be growth. You will be growing, maturing, getting more centered, becoming more individual. And the higher you will go, the more and more you will see new things happening to you – the spring coming to you and the grass growing all around. The whole of life becomes so green, so full of juice.\nYou have found the way – now go on. There is so much to discover. It is your own territory you have forgotten, your own empire that you have forgotten. Remember it. The remembrance will come also by itself.\nSo what is happening is good, but not good enough. Much more is possible. Don’t be satisfied with small things.\nUnless you have come to a point where you feel absolutely contented, don’t stop. That is the culmination of evolution, where each individual becomes a god.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nI CANNOT IMAGINE LIFE WITHOUT YOU. AT THE SAME TIME, I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT I AM HERE WITH YOU – I, WHO AM TOTALLY USELESS FOR ANYTHING. AFTER TEN YEARS OF MY STUMBLING, YOU ARE STILL POURING YOUR LOVE ON ME. IN FRONT OF SUCH ENORMOUS TREASURES, I KEEP DOING STUPID THINGS.\nBELOVED MASTER, I AM CONSTANTLY BITING YOUR FINGER. EACH TIME I REALIZE THIS, I FEEL I HURT YOU: I AM A HELPLESS DISCIPLE. IS THERE SOMETHING, SOME PATTERN THAT I HAVE BEEN REPEATING AGAIN AND AGAIN IN THE PAST?\nNo, it has nothing to do with the past.\nYou are for the first time a seeker. So rejoice that you are growing in your alertness: you can see your stumblings, you can see your stupidities.\nJust seeing is the way to get rid of them. See clearly, but don’t try to get rid of them. The people who try to get rid of something... it simply means their seeing is not strong enough, and they are trying to make up for it by doing something.\nIf seeing is intense enough, total, it is a fire.\nSo the first thing: don’t be worried about past lives. This is a fresh adventure, you are not repeating any pattern. Then it would be very difficult to get out of it, because you have repeated that pattern so many times that it has become almost second nature. When you are fresh, a new seeker, things are very easy because you don’t have any pattern to repeat.\nJust be alert and go on seeing things as they are. If it is a mistake, to see it as a mistake is enough: you will not commit it again. You need not even decide that “I will not commit it again.” Just seeing it... Once you have seen that two plus two is four, not five, you don’t take any decision that “I will not make the same mistake again, of making two plus two equal five.” There is no need – you have seen the fault and it has disappeared.\nSee where you stumble. Perhaps there is a stone on the way – use it as a stepping stone. One has to use everything for one’s growth – mistakes, stumbling, stones, faults, everything is a learning, just you have to be alert.\nAnd you are not unworthy. Nobody is. Existence does not allow unworthy people. Even though we may think somebody is unworthy, he must have some worth because existence is still nourishing him, helping him, hoping that he will change. Nobody is unworthy.\nAnd you need not be thankful or grateful towards me. I am your master. If you achieve, I achieve; if you fail, I fail. This is the contract. So in your glory is my glory; in your becoming awakened, I will become awakened again.\nWith each disciple becoming awakened, I will have to become awakened again and again.\nSo don’t be bothered with anything else. Pour your whole energy into working for consciousness... and you have the capacity. This question is from Geeta. I had to repeat inside myself, “Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna,” to remember her name!\nYou have the capacity and you are immensely valuable. So drop that idea of unworthiness, because those are the ideas that society has been teaching everybody: “You are unworthy, you cannot do anything in your life.

SPRING COMES AND THE GRASS GROWS BY ITSELF,” MY WESTERN MIND THOUGHT
THIS WAS A METAPHOR, AND SOUGHT TO FIND THE MEANING. THEN I THOUGHT YOU
REALLY MEANT TO SIT SILENTLY – AND I FELT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. NOW,
SITTING SILENTLY IN YOUR PRESENCE, DOING NOTHING I FIND IS PURE HEDONISM
– AND THE GRASS IS GROWING BY ITSELF. BELOVED MASTER, I AM AMAZED, AND
MY GRATITUDE IS BEYOND WORDS.</p><p><br></p><p>The East and the West have gone so far away from each other that
there is always misunderstanding: neither the East understands the West
nor the West understands the East. But in the final reckoning, the West
is the loser.</p><p><br></p><p>For ten thousand years the East has chosen a path which is not of the
mind – which is not intellectual, which is not rational, which is not
logical, which is not scientific. And the West has chosen just the
opposite.</p><p><br></p><p>The West is still far away from reaching the final heights of
rational flight. And perhaps it will never be able to reach the end,
because its enquiry is about the objects outside you. There is an
infinity of universe, and the deeper science goes the more it finds that
it knows nothing. Its knowledge only helps it to know that much more is
to be known and there seems to be no end in view.</p><p>On the other hand, the East has reached its goal: it has attained to
the ultimate consciousness. In a certain way, it has reached inner
perfection. This creates new difficulties of misunderstanding, because
the East speaks from the heights of final realization and the West can
understand only relative truths which are changing every day.</p><p><br></p><p>They have also chosen to speak in different ways. The East speaks in
poetic metaphors; the West speaks in terms of mathematics. The East
speaks intuitively; the West, only intellectually.</p><p><br></p><p>It is one of the greatest problems to be solved – how East and West
can come together. Their meeting is absolutely necessary; otherwise,
whatever has been attained in the East, or in the West, will all
disappear into nuclear smoke.</p><p><br></p><p>I can understand Kaveesha’s question. When she first heard the famous
haiku – “Sitting silently, doing nothing, the spring comes and the grass
grows by itself” – it was natural for her to understand it as poetry, as
metaphoric expression. The mind trained in the Western way cannot think
otherwise. It is impossible to think this is a description of a
reality.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no metaphor involved. It is not poetry. Haiku is not poetry.
Its formation is poetic, but what it contains is reality. Only its
container is poetic, but the content is absolute reality.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is difficult, for the simple reason... first, sitting silently
is against the Western mind. The West has the proverb, “The empty mind
is the devil’s workshop.” Sitting silently, you will be empty. And from
your childhood you have heard that the empty mind is the devil’s
workshop. The East knows something totally different. It is a workshop –
not of the devil but of the divine.</p><p><br></p><p>The first sentence creates great hurdles. Everybody in the West is
taught to think, and thinking pays in life – sitting silently won’t pay.
It is not a qualification; maybe it can be called a DISqualification. If
you apply for a job and tell the employer that your qualification is
sitting silently, doing nothing, the spring comes and the grass grows by
itself, he will be simply amazed! They will simply throw you out of the
office – “You sit somewhere else, because we don’t want the grass to
grow here!” In their eyes, you must be mad.</p><p><br></p><p>The West has never developed any meditation – it is poor in that way,
very poor. It knows only prayer, which is not even a faraway echo of
meditation. Even the so-called prophets and saviors and messiahs have
never been able to go beyond prayer – prayer is the last thing, because
God is the ultimate goal.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is a revolution in religion.</p><p><br></p><p>It simply drops God, without even arguing against it. It is not even
worthy of that, because it is a hypothesis – unproved, unexperienced; it
does not deserve to be considered.</p><p><br></p><p>I had a friend, Professor Wilson, who was teaching in a theological
college in Jabalpur. He could not understand that there can be a
religion which has no God, which has no prayer. The West, for the last
four or five centuries, has never conceived that religion is possible
without God, without prayer. In fact it is only possible without them.
They are the disturbances, obstructions on the way to religious
revolution. They are the enemies.</p><p>The devil has not done any wrong in the world – he does not exist.
God also does not exist, but he has done immense harm. God has kept
man’s mind focused on something outside, and when you are focused on the
outside, you remain in the mind. Meditation cannot be focused outside;
only mind has the capacity to be focused outside. Mind cannot be focused
inside; only meditation can do that. So meditation and mind go
diametrically opposite ways.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not without reason that people of meditation have called their
path the path of no-mind. But with the mind being dropped, gods, all
kinds of theologies, devils, heaven and hell and their details, the
ideas of sin and virtue – they are all dropped because they are all part
of the mind. And the West has remained mind-obsessed – as if you are
only mind and nothing more, your existence consists of mind-body, and
that’s all.</p><p><br></p><p>Trained in the Western ways, Kaveesha thought that it must be some
metaphor, or perhaps there is some meaning in it. ‘Meaning’ is a mind
word: if there is some meaning in it, then think about the meaning, find
out the meaning of it.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot find any meaning in it. It comes from an inner source of
your being, where meaning itself has no meaning, where things simply are
– with great splendor, with tremendous beauty, but no meaning. Meaning
is a logical concept, and logic is a mind product. Existence knows
nothing about it.</p><p><br></p><p>So first she thought it may be a metaphor. Obviously, this will come
to the Western mind. But a metaphor also has to have some meaning. It
must indicate towards something; it must be a metaphor for something, a
representative, a pointer. But what meaning is there? Seen with an
attitude which is searching for meaning, the haiku is meaningless. It is
an experience. And it actually describes everything that happens to
consciousness – just in those few words.</p><p><br></p><p>And that is the beauty of haiku. It uses the minimal amount of words.
You cannot take a single word out of it, it has been already taken: only
the most essential has been left.</p><p><br></p><p>Sitting silently – there are two words. It starts with sitting, it
starts with the body. If the body can sit restfully, relaxed, it helps
immensely for the mind to become silent. If the body is restless, tense,
then the mind cannot be silent. So the haiku is starting from the very
foundation: “sitting” simply means relaxed, restful, at ease, at home,
no tensions.</p><p><br></p><p>You see millions of statues of Buddha all over Asia – and Buddha
himself said before he died, “Don’t make a statue of me.” For almost
three hundred years the disciples, generation after generation, resisted
the temptation. But as the physical presence of Buddha became far away –
four hundred years, five hundred years – the temptation to have at least
a marble statue sitting in the same posture as Buddha... It does not
matter whether it is a photographic representation or not; that is
irrelevant. What matters is that it will help to give you inspiration,
understanding of how to sit.</p><p><br></p><p>And for that, the marble statue is even better than a real Buddha,
because it is completely relaxed – no tensions, no movement. They gave
it such proportion, such beauty, such aesthetic sensibility, that if you
sit by the side of a Buddha statue, you would like to sit in the same
way. And the miracle you will feel is that as you start sitting in the
same way, the mind starts settling... as if the evening has come and the
birds are coming back to their homes, to their trees. Soon it will be
night and all the birds will have settled in their nests, fallen
asleep.</p><p>And if you are fortunate to be in the presence of a living, awakened
being, his restful body will create a synchronicity with your bodies,
because it is of the same matter. All bodies are made of the same matter
and function on the same wavelength.</p><p><br></p><p>If the sitting is right, silence descends on you just as the evening
comes and then all becomes dark.</p><p><br></p><p>Sitting silently... The second thing is the mind. The body should be
non-tense, and the mind should be without any thought.</p><p><br></p><p>Sitting silently, doing nothing... This is very significant to
understand. Even the idea that you are doing meditation is a
disturbance, because every “doing” makes the mind active. Mind can
remain passive only when you are in a state of non-doing, doing
nothing...</p><p><br></p><p>This small haiku contains the whole philosophy of the Eastern
approach. It is not even a meditation; you are not doing anything, you
are simply rejoicing in rest. You are enjoying the peace that comes on
its own, it is not your doing. You are simply waiting, not doing...
waiting for things to happen. There is no hurry, there is no worry.</p><p><br></p><p>THE SPRING COMES... Remember, existence has no obligation to fulfill
your desires; hence, the sentence, THE SPRING COMES... You may be in a
different season, and the grass may not grow. Don’t complain that “I was
sitting silently and the grass was not growing.” You were out of tune
with existence.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to follow existence. The spring comes – you have to wait for
the spring to come, you cannot bring it, you cannot manufacture it; it
is not in your hands. The spring comes – it comes – and the grass grows
by itself. And suddenly everything becomes green; suddenly, everywhere
grass is growing. Nobody is doing anything, just the spring has come and
its coming is enough for the grass to grow.</p><p><br></p><p>You are sitting silently, doing nothing, simply waiting for the
spring to come. Just as the outside spring comes, the inside spring also
comes. There are inner seasons of life. So don’t be worried – the spring
is bound to come.</p><p><br></p><p>And at the time the haiku was written, the spring used to come
exactly the same day every year; for centuries that had been the
routine. In my childhood in India, every season was coming exactly on
the same day. There was no question about what day the rains would
begin, on what day the rains would end. But because of atomic
explosions... they have disturbed the whole ecology. Now nothing is
certain: sometimes rains come, sometimes they don’t come at all;
sometimes they come too much, too early. The old rhythm, the old
balance, is there no more.</p><p><br></p><p>But fortunately, atomic explosions cannot disturb your inner world.
They cannot reach there. There, the spring comes exactly when you are
ready. The Egyptian saying is, “When the disciple is ready, the master
appears.” The master has to appear when the disciple is ready. The
disciple need not worry about the master, he has just to be ready. His
readiness is enough to give a call to the master.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is absolutely true: the master appears when the disciple is
ready. Sitting silently, doing nothing, you are getting ready. No
desire, no worry whether the spring will come or not – it always comes,
it has never been otherwise. The moment you are ready, it is there.</p><p>And when the spring comes to your inner world, as if thousands of
flowers have opened up, the whole air changes: it is fresh and fragrant,
the birds start singing. Your inner world becomes a music unto itself, a
fragrance unto itself – and the grass grows by itself.</p><p><br></p><p>By “the grass” is indicated your life, your life force. Green is the
symbol for the living. In connection with spring, everything becomes
green. And once you have experienced this phenomenon, you have known the
greatest secret there is – that there are things which you cannot do,
but can only allow to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is possible, Kaveesha: sitting here just doing nothing, the
spring may come at any moment, and for the first time you will
understand the significance of the haiku, because something in you
starts growing, so alive – it is pure life. It is you, it is your being.
But there is no way to intellectually understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East for thousands of years, disciples have been sitting by
the side of the master, just doing nothing. It looks strange to the
Western mind: what is the point of sitting there? If you go to a Sufi
gathering, the master is sitting in the middle and all around his
disciples are sitting silently – nothing is happening, the master is not
even saying anything. Hours pass...</p><p><br></p><p>But something transpires – they all feel a fulfillment. When they
come out, they are radiant. The master has not done anything; neither
have they done anything. They just fall in tune because both were not
doing anything, both were silent.</p><p><br></p><p>It is possible that now you understand the haiku. Sitting here every
day, just listening to me, a silence descends on you and suddenly there
is spring and the grass is growing.</p><p><br></p><p>The East has to be understood in its own ways. If somebody tries to
interpret it intellectually, he has missed the point from the very
beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>TO ME, YOUR DISCOURSES FEEL LIKE AN INSIDE DEEP CLEANING. WHATEVER
LOAD OF PAIN, ANGER, OR ANY NEGATIVE FEELING I CARRY WITH ME WHEN I COME
INTO DISCOURSE, IT HAS DISAPPEARED WHEN I WALK OUT, AND I FEEL LIGHT AND
REFRESHED. SOMETIMES, IT DOESN’T TAKE ME LONG TO CREATE ANOTHER ONE, BUT
I KNOW IT IS NOT GOING TO LAST LONGER THAN THE END OF THE NEXT
DISCOURSE. WHEN AWAY FROM YOU, ALTHOUGH I USED TO MEDITATE EVERY DAY,
THINGS WERE TAKING MUCH LONGER TO DISAPPEAR. CAN YOU COMMENT?</p><p><br></p><p>It is the same thing... Away from me you were trying to meditate, and
that doer was your disturbance. With me... I am not even telling you to
meditate. I am just talking to you and creating a certain atmosphere in
which meditation happens to you.</p><p><br></p><p>So while you are here, see the difference between doing and
happening. Alone also, let it happen. If you become accustomed to my
voice, perhaps you can put on the tape recorder: forget about</p><p>meditation; you just listen and the meditation will come. And, slowly
slowly, this coming of meditation can be detached from listening to
me.</p><p><br></p><p>You can sit by the side of the sea and listen to the waves crashing
on the shore – so joyfully, so dancingly they come, and they have been
doing that for millennia and they are not tired yet. Just listen to
them. Or sitting under a tree, just listen to the birds, or the wind
blowing through the tree.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly slowly, get rid of listening too. Just sit silently – because
that listening was only a device. This is only a device to help you
avoid doing. But the device is only for the beginning; soon you have to
drop the device and it will be happening anywhere you are, and it will
cleanse you the same way it does here.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember one thing: if it cleanses you, that does not mean you
have to be careless about collecting the garbage again because you know
in meditation it will be cleaned away. You are using meditation for a
very small job. It is not meant for that.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard – it happened in Burma after the second world war – a
small airplane was left in the forest. The Japanese were surrendering,
but a few stubborn samurais still wanted to fight, so they escaped in an
airplane. Then they left the airplane in the forest, and were hiding
somewhere in the forest.</p><p><br></p><p>But a tribe lived there, a very ancient tribe. They had seen
airplanes in the sky, but they could not connect the two things, that
this was the same thing they had called “the great bird.” They tried to
figure it out: “What is it? It has wheels, so one thing is certain, it
is a vehicle.”</p><p><br></p><p>They used it with two horses as a bullock cart. And it was working
well and they were very happy: “This is great!” Then somebody who had
been to the city, said, “You don’t know – this is not a bullock cart, it
is a car. Just... I don’t understand why these wings are there, but let
me try...” And he tried, and it started.</p><p><br></p><p>Then they started using it as a car, and the man suggested, “You will
need fuel, so somebody who goes to the city should bring fuel. No
horses, no bullocks are needed, just fill it with fuel and use it as a
car.” And they were immensely happy.</p><p><br></p><p>Then a man who had been in the army passed by and he said, “What are
you doing! You are using a small aircraft as a car? This can fly.”</p><p><br></p><p>They could not believe it. They asked, “Is it a great bird?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Yes,” and he was a pilot, so he showed them how to fly
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation can be used as a bullock cart – and that’s how you are
using it, just cleaning the rubbish that you accumulate. But you will
accumulate that rubbish every day and you will have to clean it every
day. Meditation is a great bird, and you are using it for something it
is not meant for, although it can do that work too.</p><p><br></p><p>So when it cleanses your burden, be careful not to collect it again.
What is the need to collect the burden? – just unawareness. And what you
collect is all rubbish. You know it – that’s why, when</p><p>through meditation it is cleaned away, you feel fresh. So why destroy
your freshness? Don’t collect it. And the way is to be more alert, to be
more meditative, even while you are doing other things. It is a great
defense, it won’t allow any rubbish to collect. And slowly slowly, you
will be collecting less, and one day you will find, between two
meditations, that you have not collected anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the bullock cart can become a motor car – and there is a great
distance between the two. Now you don’t need the bullocks or the horses
to carry it, and it can go faster. Now you have speed; otherwise, you
can do the same thing every day and you will die the same.</p><p><br></p><p>And when there is nothing else to cleanse, then the meditation, your
energy, starts rising up because there is no work on the ground. You can
take off. You can become a bird in the inner sky. Then it will not be
only refreshing, it will be growth. You will be growing, maturing,
getting more centered, becoming more individual. And the higher you will
go, the more and more you will see new things happening to you – the
spring coming to you and the grass growing all around. The whole of life
becomes so green, so full of juice.</p><p><br></p><p>You have found the way – now go on. There is so much to discover. It
is your own territory you have forgotten, your own empire that you have
forgotten. Remember it. The remembrance will come also by itself.</p><p><br></p><p>So what is happening is good, but not good enough. Much more is
possible. Don’t be satisfied with small things.</p><p><br></p><p>Unless you have come to a point where you feel absolutely contented,
don’t stop. That is the culmination of evolution, where each individual
becomes a god.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I CANNOT IMAGINE LIFE WITHOUT YOU. AT THE SAME TIME, I CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT I AM HERE WITH YOU – I, WHO AM TOTALLY USELESS FOR ANYTHING. AFTER
TEN YEARS OF MY STUMBLING, YOU ARE STILL POURING YOUR LOVE ON ME. IN
FRONT OF SUCH ENORMOUS TREASURES, I KEEP DOING STUPID THINGS.</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED MASTER, I AM CONSTANTLY BITING YOUR FINGER. EACH TIME I
REALIZE THIS, I FEEL I HURT YOU: I AM A HELPLESS DISCIPLE. IS THERE
SOMETHING, SOME PATTERN THAT I HAVE BEEN REPEATING AGAIN AND AGAIN IN
THE PAST?</p><p><br></p><p>No, it has nothing to do with the past.</p><p><br></p><p>You are for the first time a seeker. So rejoice that you are growing
in your alertness: you can see your stumblings, you can see your
stupidities.</p><p><br></p><p>Just seeing is the way to get rid of them. See clearly, but don’t try
to get rid of them. The people who try to get rid of something... it
simply means their seeing is not strong enough, and they are trying to
make up for it by doing something.</p><p>If seeing is intense enough, total, it is a fire.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing: don’t be worried about past lives. This is a
fresh adventure, you are not repeating any pattern. Then it would be
very difficult to get out of it, because you have repeated that pattern
so many times that it has become almost second nature. When you are
fresh, a new seeker, things are very easy because you don’t have any
pattern to repeat.</p><p><br></p><p>Just be alert and go on seeing things as they are. If it is a
mistake, to see it as a mistake is enough: you will not commit it again.
You need not even decide that “I will not commit it again.” Just seeing
it... Once you have seen that two plus two is four, not five, you don’t
take any decision that “I will not make the same mistake again, of
making two plus two equal five.” There is no need – you have seen the
fault and it has disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>See where you stumble. Perhaps there is a stone on the way – use it
as a stepping stone. One has to use everything for one’s growth –
mistakes, stumbling, stones, faults, everything is a learning, just you
have to be alert.</p><p><br></p><p>And you are not unworthy. Nobody is. Existence does not allow
unworthy people. Even though we may think somebody is unworthy, he must
have some worth because existence is still nourishing him, helping him,
hoping that he will change. Nobody is unworthy.</p><p><br></p><p>And you need not be thankful or grateful towards me. I am your
master. If you achieve, I achieve; if you fail, I fail. This is the
contract. So in your glory is my glory; in your becoming awakened, I
will become awakened again.</p><p><br></p><p>With each disciple becoming awakened, I will have to become awakened
again and again.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t be bothered with anything else. Pour your whole energy into
working for consciousness... and you have the capacity. This question is
from Geeta. I had to repeat inside myself, “Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna,”
to remember her name!</p><p><br></p><p>You have the capacity and you are immensely valuable. So drop that
idea of unworthiness, because those are the ideas that society has been
teaching everybody: “You are unworthy, you cannot do anything in your
life. You have to prove yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>To me, the situation is totally different. Everybody is born worthy.
It is just that we push him into wrong directions and make him unworthy.
Unworthiness is something forced upon us – worthiness is our
birthright.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am not forcing anybody into anything. I am simply bringing you
back home to your own self.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part23>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

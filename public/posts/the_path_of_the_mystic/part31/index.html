IN THE MOMENT ALL IS STILL, AND IT IS THE ONLY WAY FOR ME TO STAND ON THE RAZOR’S EDGE. AND YET A DOUBT COMES IN THAT I AM ESCAPING WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING: I MAY SIMPLY BE WEARING BLINKERS. BELOVED, PLEASE HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHICH IS TRUE.\nNever listen to the mind. Mind is the great deceiver. If you are feeling silent and still in the present moment, that experience is so valuable that mind has no authority to judge it. Mind is far below it.\nMind is always of the past or about the future. Either memory or imagination, it knows nothing of the present. And all that is, is in the present.\nMind is a beggar. It goes on hoping that tomorrow things will be better, that the golden age is going to come... or the golden age has passed and there is nothing in the future except darkness. These are the two possibilities for the mind to take. About the present, whatsoever it says is a lie, because it has no experience of it; it has never come into the moment. By its very nature it is either in the past or in the future.\nBecause the mind has no experience – and cannot have any experience – of the present, don’t listen to it when it comes with any judgment concerning the present moment. And silence is of the present. Joy is of the present. Ecstasy is of the present.\n331\nMind can do only one thing: it can create doubt. It cannot say directly, “What you are experiencing is wrong,” because that much is beyond it, but it can say, “You are escaping from the reality that is past, or the reality that is to come, the future.” It can condemn you as an escapist, saying, “You are afraid of life. Life is big enough; the present moment is too small. Life is vast. Don’t escape from life just to enjoy a momentary silence and joy and peace.” And it looks logical on the surface.\nBut life consists only of moments; there is no past life, there is no future life. Whenever life is, it is always in the present.\nAnd this is the dichotomy: life is herenow, and mind is never herenow. This is one of the most important discoveries of the East, that mind is absolutely impotent as far as your subjectivity is concerned, as far as your being is concerned.\nMind is perfectly all right with objects, but the moment it comes close to life, it starts doubting even the existence of life. It starts creating philosophies that life is only a by-product.\nMaterialism is an old philosophy, but one of the most dull and dead. From the charvakas in India, five thousand years past, to Karl Marx, it has repeatedly said the same thing in different languages – that life is a by-product, it has no existence by itself. Man is just a machine, pure matter. Just a certain combination creates the illusion of life and consciousness – they are epiphenomena.\nMaterialism, to me, seems to be the most unprogressive ideology in the world, because in five thousand years it has not produced a single new argument – the same old rut. But mind feels very happy with it, because then there is no need to bother about meditation – which is a deep fear for the mind, because it is committing suicide as far as the mind is concerned. Then there is no need to be in the present. But you will be missing everything, the whole treasure that existence is ready to bestow upon you.\nWhenever you experience something that is beyond mind, mind will create doubt, will argue against it, will make you look embarrassed about it. These are its old techniques. It cannot produce anything of the quality that the present moment creates. In fact mind is not creative at all. All creation in any dimension of life comes from the no-mind – the greatest paintings, the great music, the great poetry – all that is beautiful, all that makes man different from animals, comes from that small moment.\nIf knowingly you enter into it, it can lead you to enlightenment. If unknowingly, accidentally, it happens, then it still leads to a tremendous silence, relaxation, peace, intelligence. If it is just an accident... you had reached the temple but missed by just one more step. That’s where I think all creative artists, dancers, musicians, scientists, are... just one step more.\nThe mystic enters to the very core of the present moment and finds the golden key; his whole life becomes a divine rejoicing. Whatever happens, his rejoicing is not going to be affected.\nBut until you have entered the shrine, even at the very last moment, mind will still try to pull you back: “Where are you going? This is sheer madness! You are escaping from life.”\nAnd mind has never given you any life. It has never given you any taste so that you can see what life is. It has never revealed any mystery. But it is constantly pulling you back, because once you enter\nthe shrine it will be left outside, just where you leave your shoes. It cannot enter into the shrine. It is not in its capacity, its potential.\nSo be watchful. When the mind says to you that you are escaping from life, say to the mind, “Where is life? What life are you talking about? I am escaping into life, not from life.” Be very alert about the mind because that is your enemy inside you, and if you are not alert, that enemy can sabotage every possibility of growth. Just a little alertness, and mind cannot do any harm.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nI FEEL TODAY AS IF I AM HAVING A BRIEF RESPITE AFTER BEING PUT THROUGH A WASHING MACHINE IN THE LAST TWO DAYS. IT IS SUCH AN INCREDIBLE SWEET AND CLEANSING EXPERIENCE TO LET OURSELVES BE TAKEN UP IN WHATEVER WHIRLWIND IS PRECIPITATED BY OR AROUND YOU... SO MUCH SO THAT ONE IS SIMPLY QUIETLY AMAZED TO FIND THAT ONE HAS EMERGED FROM THE OTHER END.\nI DON’T THINK THIS IS A QUESTION, JUST A WAY OF SAYING “AHHHHH!”\nAha! This is not a question; otherwise I would have to answer it. Great! Thank you! Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nWHEN I HEARD YOU SAY LAUGHTER IS A SMALL RELEASE FROM OUR MISERY, MY MIND WOULD NOT COMPUTE. IT FELT AS THOUGH HYSTERIA WAS FILLING THE ROOM AS WE ALL LAUGHED, AND I AM STILL ASKING MYSELF, “WHAT HAPPENED?”\nYou can see what happened! It can look like hysteria. For example, when you understand something and laughter happens as a relief from misery, a great energy is released. Every understanding releases accumulated energies in you.\nFor example, you are not laughing the whole day – only once in a while. You are not being loving the whole day – only once in a while. What happens to the energy in the big gaps? It accumulates, and if you come to an understanding of a certain phenomenon there is a great release, and the release is so strong that it will feel hysterical. But it is not hysterical; it is really getting relief from energy which could have become hysterical any moment.\nYou can find people in madhouses laughing for hours, laughing so much that tears come to their eyes. They are mad because they could not manage to release their energies in a healthy, in a proportionate way.\nThose energies accumulated in you are a potential danger – and your whole society is for repression. Everything has to be according to the manners and the etiquette; you can never have a good hearty laugh. The society does not allow you that much.\nIt seems there is a fear running in the society from generation to generation that allowing all man’s energies to be expressed is dangerous, because there is anger, there is violence, there is jealousy, there is a suicidal instinct, and so many things. If all these are allowed, everybody will go mad – he will not be able to control them. So our whole society is based on controlling and repressing. But it has not created a beautiful man. It may have avoided madness, but it is a negative phenomenon – it has not created sanity.\nMy approach is simple: energies should not be repressed but expressed, and you should find ways of expressing them so that those very ways become creative.\nIn India I used to visit jails to talk to the prisoners, and the strangest thing that I came to understand was, these prisoners were more innocent than the ordinary people outside. At first it was very puzzling because these were criminals: somebody was a murderer, somebody was a rapist. They had done every kind of thing against the law, against society, against order, but they looked very innocent, and they had a certain calmness. You could not see on their faces violence, murder, rape – no signs. Outside you can stand on the road and you can see on people’s faces all kinds of crimes that they are repressing.\nThe thing was clear: these people did not repress. They simply did whatever came to their mind; they simply did it. They did not bother about law and society; naturally society cannot tolerate these people. They have to be criminals, they have to be punished. It is a vengeance.\nI enquired of all the superintendents whose jails I had visited... because the governor of my state was a very innocent man, almost childlike. He was not a politician. He had come into power... because when the British government left, it was not a question of only politicians getting the power. The first generation of politicians were almost nonpolitical, because India had not been free for almost two thousand years so there was no politics. And these people were chosen for their qualities – particularly the governors because they were not elected. They were appointed by the president.\nThe president himself was a very simple man. He had a great attraction for my way of thinking, and he used to tell me, “Just do one thing: when I die, just tell God that I was not a bad man.”\n“But,” I said, “there is no God, and even if there is, I have no direct communication with him!”\nHe said, “I will not listen to you, and you cannot deceive me. You have to promise me that when I die you will tell God, ‘This man was not bad.’”\nI said, “This is a strange idea! I don’t have any God, and I don’t think you need any recommendation. You are a good man; only bad people need recommendations.” But he was very innocent, and he told me, “If you can go to the jails and help these people...”\nI had time, and I started going to the jails. I asked all the superintendents, “Has any criminal who has murdered, raped, done any other major crime, ever gone mad?” And the answer was always no.\nI said, “Have you ever thought about it? – that outside, people go mad? These are the people who should go mad, if your theologies and your religions and your so-called philosophies are right, because they have done everything that you think is wrong. But they are so innocent, simple.”\nThey said, “We have never thought about it.” It seems nobody is concerned with the basic human evolution. These criminals are so innocent, because they don’t have anything repressed; that is their innocence. And because they don’t have anything repressed, madness is impossible.\nI am not saying that everybody should start committing crimes to avoid madness and to become innocent. What I am saying is that this can give you an indication that energies should not be collected. They should be used. And if we live in a right society, they will be used creatively. The same violence which kills a man can sculpt a beautiful Gautam Buddha, because as far as the hand is concerned, it releases energy whether you cut off somebody’s head or you cut stones or you cut wood. It doesn’t matter to the hand and to the energy – the energy is released.\nI have known many hunters in India – accidentally, because I was touring all over India, and I was often a guest in a maharaja’s palace. And all these maharajas – and there were hundreds in India – and their sons and their brothers, they were all hunters. They had their own forests reserved for their hunting. But I found them very human. Their hunting was taking all their violence. You could see from their faces that there was no tension.\nBut hunting animals is also violence. We can find ways in which the energy can be used and yet no harm happens to anybody; on the contrary, something beautiful is created.\nIn one of our therapy groups a man’s hand was fractured, and it got immense publicity against me – although I was not involved in any way; I was not present in the therapy group. But nobody asked the man himself.\nI called him and asked him, “What is your feeling? How are you feeling?” – the fracture was now healed, the plaster had been removed.\nHe said, “I am amazed. I have always had the feeling that I could murder somebody. Since the fracture of the hand that feeling has disappeared. I don’t know what has happened, how it has happened, but since that time I am feeling very humble; otherwise I was very arrogant.” Perhaps his hand was collecting violence and he was repressing it. The fracture released the energy.\nI was condemned all over the world by the newspapers, that in my therapy groups violence is being used. But I was amazed: not a single journalist had the sense to have an interview with the man and enquire what had been his experience. His experience was totally different. He was feeling fortunate that it happened, because a load that he was carrying from his childhood had simply disappeared.\nSo one thing: we should understand every energy – its mechanics, its working – and give it expression.\nI had a meditation specially for laughing and many people came to me and told me that it was something they had never experienced, that it was almost psychedelic. And it was nothing: just a group was sitting, and they would start laughing. One would start, then naturally it would catch others; others would simply laugh because “this idiot is laughing for no reason.” Then others would laugh at them, and soon it would become a collective unconscious phenomenon: everybody was laughing as they had never laughed but had always wanted to.\nAnd it looked hysterical because they wanted to stop it but they were not able to stop it. They had opened a door that they were not able to close – and that made them laugh even more. “This is strange! Nothing is happening, there is nothing to laugh at, and I am laughing like a madman.” And this made them laugh more! And it is catching, contagious. After one hour’s laughter they were all relaxing because they were tired, but a great peace... They had released an energy which society does not allow you unless there is a proper occasion.\nYou have to go to a movie, you have to read a book, you have to talk gossips, meaningless, just to release it. But why not simply release it? Sit in a corner and start it. You will think that it will be difficult; it won’t be difficult, it will be very simple. Once you start, then it goes on increasing on its own.\nI have developed many meditations simply to help you unburden. And anybody who has come as an outsider to see will think, “These people are mad! Why are they laughing?” – as if the energy needs any “why.” It has to be expressed. All the energies have to be expressed. Those which can be creative, make them creative; those which cannot be made creative, make them harmless. And you will be surprised that as you release energies, you are unburdened and you are saner. There is less possibility of you ever falling into madness.\nAnd secondly, you will find fresher energies arising in you. We are continuously creating in ourselves, by food, by breathing, by exercise, by the sun, by the moon, by the stars... from everywhere energy is being poured into us. And you are carrying loads of stale energy because you don’t have space for the new energy. It is always good to have fresh and new energy, because that will keep you younger, fresher, sharper, more intelligent and more innocent.\nThe meditation looked hysterical – it was not. It was releasing hysteria; otherwise you were keeping it in. And it is good if you feel anything like that in you, just sit in your room and laugh. It is your room, and it is nobody’s business to interfere, unless somebody wants to join – he can join. And you will be surprised that by and by others will join, and you will find that everybody has come. First perhaps they had come just to see what is happening, and then seeing it, they will get triggered and they will become part of it.\nIn Japan there was an enlightened man called Hotei, whose only teaching was laughter. He would laugh, his disciples would laugh. His disciples would laugh because, “This is absolutely absurd! A buddha has never laughed! All the buddhas have been serious; this Hotei is simply falling out of the category of buddhas.” But his laughter was catching, and then others who would be judging him would start laughing, and it would spread like a fire amongst his disciples, and for hours they would enjoy... until everybody had fallen on the floor, asleep. They had laughed so much that they were like small babies, lying down.\nHotei was very much condemned by other so-called religious people, but people like Hotei don’t care. They say, “Who bothers? This is my teaching, this is my way. And if you can laugh all the way towards enlightenment then why choose another way!”\nAnd many of his disciples became enlightened just by laughing. They became so innocent, so unburdened; slowly slowly they understood what the man was doing, and they were grateful. By teaching perhaps he would not have been so helpful, but he had found something existential. He\nwould move from one place to another place with his group of disciples, and wherever he was, the people were laughing – even the people in the town were laughing hearing the noise that Hotei’s people were making. They were simply laughing – “We have never heard that religion has anything to do with laughter!” But seeing this buddha, seeing Hotei himself and Hotei’s disciples, they had to recognize that “Whatever their way may be – a little berserk, bizarre – Hotei has changed people’s lives; he has made them saner.”\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nSOMETHING YOU SAID STRUCK ME LIKE A GONG. YOU SAID – OR I HEARD – THAT ENLIGHTENMENT IS THE LAST EXPERIENCE OF THE MIND. CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THIS PLEASE?\nIt looks very contradictory to my other statements. I have said again and again that enlightenment is beyond mind. So naturally when you heard it, that I am saying enlightenment is the last experience of the mind, the contradiction was absolutely clear. But you have to understand something very subtle: experience as such needs a mind. What experience it is, does not matter, because experience means duality: the experiencer and the experienced.\nSo what I have said before was just to help you drop the mind. My words are devices, not statements. What I said yesterday was actually the fact. It is the mind’s last experience – because for experience mind is needed.\nIf there is no mind, there is no experience. You are, but you cannot talk about any experience of bliss, of ecstasy, of godliness, of nirvana. You cannot talk.\nAnd the problem for me is that unless I give you these incentives, why should you bother to be enlightened? If with the mind gone, enlightenment is also gone, and just eternal silence prevails – that too you cannot say is your experience. You are no more. That old world of subject and object, I and you, does not exist.\nYou should also try to understand the difficulty of the master, just the way the master tries to understand your difficulties. His difficulties are far greater.\nI have to give you an incentive, encouragement. The idea of being blissful, the idea of being enlightened, the idea of attaining the truth, somehow catches a few people’s minds, and they start moving in that direction. Finally they will find that all these things will happen – but they will still be of the mind. Don’t stop at that. But that can be said only to those who have traveled the path. There is something more than experience that is beyond mind.\nGautam Buddha used two words. For enlightenment he uses a word: nirvana. But he knows that there is still a step more, so he calls it mahaparinirvana.\nThe word nirvana itself means attaining to a state of silence so deep that no self exists – because that is also a disturbance. Nothing exists. You are in a state of selflessness, but still it is an experience, so you may not be seeing the self but the self is experiencing it as a selfless state.\nIt is difficult to bring even this experience into language, but there is something more, which is absolutely difficult: he calls it mahaparinirvana. And he does not define it; he does not say what it means. You have to experience it – that he leaves to you. Up to nirvana he is willing to explain, because mind, in a very subtle way, still exists to experience the selflessness, the silence, the blissfulness. But when the mind is completely gone... So he has made a word in which nirvana is there: maha means bigger, higher, greater than nirvana; and pari means transcendental. So to translate it will mean: a selflessness which is greater than the selflessness you experienced in nirvana, because now there is no experiencer.\nYou cannot call it an experience; hence he calls it parinirvana. It transcends everything that can be conceived, because anything that you can conceive is conceived by the mind. We have to use the mind for a certain stage, but we cannot say that with the mind we have achieved the ultimate.\nSo nirvana is the last milestone from where the road ends. Beyond that one has simply to go and see. Just to indicate it, he calls it mahaparinirvana: the great transcendental selflessness.\nThe problem is that I had to talk to many kinds of people all my life, and I had to talk the way they can understand; otherwise it is pointless. Slowly slowly I gathered my own people, and I started talking irrespective of whether they understand or not, because I knew they loved me: they will try to understand it.\nBut many of them could not rise to that level where they are ready to understand, in spite of themselves, something that goes beyond their heads. But now I am going to talk only to those people whom I can completely forget when I am talking. I can trust that they will manage to get at least a certain sense and taste of it.\nSo you will find more and more contradictions because now I will not be talking to you, I will be simply saying whatever is the case – whether you can understand it or not. If you don’t understand, you can go on asking questions, but before I leave the world I have to complete what I have started.

NOW. IN THE MOMENT ALL IS STILL, AND IT IS THE ONLY WAY FOR ME TO STAND
ON THE RAZOR’S EDGE. AND YET A DOUBT COMES IN THAT I AM ESCAPING WHAT IS
REALLY HAPPENING: I MAY SIMPLY BE WEARING BLINKERS. BELOVED, PLEASE HELP
ME UNDERSTAND WHICH IS TRUE.</p><p>Never listen to the mind. Mind is the great deceiver. If you are
feeling silent and still in the present moment, that experience is so
valuable that mind has no authority to judge it. Mind is far below
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is always of the past or about the future. Either memory or
imagination, it knows nothing of the present. And all that is, is in the
present.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is a beggar. It goes on hoping that tomorrow things will be
better, that the golden age is going to come... or the golden age has
passed and there is nothing in the future except darkness. These are the
two possibilities for the mind to take. About the present, whatsoever it
says is a lie, because it has no experience of it; it has never come
into the moment. By its very nature it is either in the past or in the
future.</p><p><br></p><p>Because the mind has no experience – and cannot have any experience –
of the present, don’t listen to it when it comes with any judgment
concerning the present moment. And silence is of the present. Joy is of
the present. Ecstasy is of the present.</p><p><br></p><p>331</p><p>Mind can do only one thing: it can create doubt. It cannot say
directly, “What you are experiencing is wrong,” because that much is
beyond it, but it can say, “You are escaping from the reality that is
past, or the reality that is to come, the future.” It can condemn you as
an escapist, saying, “You are afraid of life. Life is big enough; the
present moment is too small. Life is vast. Don’t escape from life just
to enjoy a momentary silence and joy and peace.” And it looks logical on
the surface.</p><p><br></p><p>But life consists only of moments; there is no past life, there is no
future life. Whenever life is, it is always in the present.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the dichotomy: life is herenow, and mind is never
herenow. This is one of the most important discoveries of the East, that
mind is absolutely impotent as far as your subjectivity is concerned, as
far as your being is concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is perfectly all right with objects, but the moment it comes
close to life, it starts doubting even the existence of life. It starts
creating philosophies that life is only a by-product.</p><p><br></p><p>Materialism is an old philosophy, but one of the most dull and dead.
From the charvakas in India, five thousand years past, to Karl Marx, it
has repeatedly said the same thing in different languages – that life is
a by-product, it has no existence by itself. Man is just a machine, pure
matter. Just a certain combination creates the illusion of life and
consciousness – they are epiphenomena.</p><p><br></p><p>Materialism, to me, seems to be the most unprogressive ideology in
the world, because in five thousand years it has not produced a single
new argument – the same old rut. But mind feels very happy with it,
because then there is no need to bother about meditation – which is a
deep fear for the mind, because it is committing suicide as far as the
mind is concerned. Then there is no need to be in the present. But you
will be missing everything, the whole treasure that existence is ready
to bestow upon you.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you experience something that is beyond mind, mind will
create doubt, will argue against it, will make you look embarrassed
about it. These are its old techniques. It cannot produce anything of
the quality that the present moment creates. In fact mind is not
creative at all. All creation in any dimension of life comes from the
no-mind – the greatest paintings, the great music, the great poetry –
all that is beautiful, all that makes man different from animals, comes
from that small moment.</p><p><br></p><p>If knowingly you enter into it, it can lead you to enlightenment. If
unknowingly, accidentally, it happens, then it still leads to a
tremendous silence, relaxation, peace, intelligence. If it is just an
accident... you had reached the temple but missed by just one more step.
That’s where I think all creative artists, dancers, musicians,
scientists, are... just one step more.</p><p><br></p><p>The mystic enters to the very core of the present moment and finds
the golden key; his whole life becomes a divine rejoicing. Whatever
happens, his rejoicing is not going to be affected.</p><p><br></p><p>But until you have entered the shrine, even at the very last moment,
mind will still try to pull you back: “Where are you going? This is
sheer madness! You are escaping from life.”</p><p><br></p><p>And mind has never given you any life. It has never given you any
taste so that you can see what life is. It has never revealed any
mystery. But it is constantly pulling you back, because once you
enter</p><p>the shrine it will be left outside, just where you leave your shoes.
It cannot enter into the shrine. It is not in its capacity, its
potential.</p><p><br></p><p>So be watchful. When the mind says to you that you are escaping from
life, say to the mind, “Where is life? What life are you talking about?
I am escaping into life, not from life.” Be very alert about the mind
because that is your enemy inside you, and if you are not alert, that
enemy can sabotage every possibility of growth. Just a little alertness,
and mind cannot do any harm.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I FEEL TODAY AS IF I AM HAVING A BRIEF RESPITE AFTER BEING PUT
THROUGH A WASHING MACHINE IN THE LAST TWO DAYS. IT IS SUCH AN INCREDIBLE
SWEET AND CLEANSING EXPERIENCE TO LET OURSELVES BE TAKEN UP IN WHATEVER
WHIRLWIND IS PRECIPITATED BY OR AROUND YOU... SO MUCH SO THAT ONE IS
SIMPLY QUIETLY AMAZED TO FIND THAT ONE HAS EMERGED FROM THE OTHER
END.</p><p><br></p><p>I DON’T THINK THIS IS A QUESTION, JUST A WAY OF SAYING “AHHHHH!”</p><p><br></p><p>Aha! This is not a question; otherwise I would have to answer it.
Great! Thank you! Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN I HEARD YOU SAY LAUGHTER IS A SMALL RELEASE FROM OUR MISERY, MY
MIND WOULD NOT COMPUTE. IT FELT AS THOUGH HYSTERIA WAS FILLING THE ROOM
AS WE ALL LAUGHED, AND I AM STILL ASKING MYSELF, “WHAT HAPPENED?”</p><p><br></p><p>You can see what happened! It can look like hysteria. For example,
when you understand something and laughter happens as a relief from
misery, a great energy is released. Every understanding releases
accumulated energies in you.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, you are not laughing the whole day – only once in a
while. You are not being loving the whole day – only once in a while.
What happens to the energy in the big gaps? It accumulates, and if you
come to an understanding of a certain phenomenon there is a great
release, and the release is so strong that it will feel hysterical. But
it is not hysterical; it is really getting relief from energy which
could have become hysterical any moment.</p><p><br></p><p>You can find people in madhouses laughing for hours, laughing so much
that tears come to their eyes. They are mad because they could not
manage to release their energies in a healthy, in a proportionate
way.</p><p><br></p><p>Those energies accumulated in you are a potential danger – and your
whole society is for repression. Everything has to be according to the
manners and the etiquette; you can never have a good hearty laugh. The
society does not allow you that much.</p><p>It seems there is a fear running in the society from generation to
generation that allowing all man’s energies to be expressed is
dangerous, because there is anger, there is violence, there is jealousy,
there is a suicidal instinct, and so many things. If all these are
allowed, everybody will go mad – he will not be able to control them. So
our whole society is based on controlling and repressing. But it has not
created a beautiful man. It may have avoided madness, but it is a
negative phenomenon – it has not created sanity.</p><p><br></p><p>My approach is simple: energies should not be repressed but
expressed, and you should find ways of expressing them so that those
very ways become creative.</p><p><br></p><p>In India I used to visit jails to talk to the prisoners, and the
strangest thing that I came to understand was, these prisoners were more
innocent than the ordinary people outside. At first it was very puzzling
because these were criminals: somebody was a murderer, somebody was a
rapist. They had done every kind of thing against the law, against
society, against order, but they looked very innocent, and they had a
certain calmness. You could not see on their faces violence, murder,
rape – no signs. Outside you can stand on the road and you can see on
people’s faces all kinds of crimes that they are repressing.</p><p><br></p><p>The thing was clear: these people did not repress. They simply did
whatever came to their mind; they simply did it. They did not bother
about law and society; naturally society cannot tolerate these people.
They have to be criminals, they have to be punished. It is a
vengeance.</p><p><br></p><p>I enquired of all the superintendents whose jails I had visited...
because the governor of my state was a very innocent man, almost
childlike. He was not a politician. He had come into power... because
when the British government left, it was not a question of only
politicians getting the power. The first generation of politicians were
almost nonpolitical, because India had not been free for almost two
thousand years so there was no politics. And these people were chosen
for their qualities – particularly the governors because they were not
elected. They were appointed by the president.</p><p><br></p><p>The president himself was a very simple man. He had a great
attraction for my way of thinking, and he used to tell me, “Just do one
thing: when I die, just tell God that I was not a bad man.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But,” I said, “there is no God, and even if there is, I have no
direct communication with him!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I will not listen to you, and you cannot deceive me. You
have to promise me that when I die you will tell God, ‘This man was not
bad.’”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “This is a strange idea! I don’t have any God, and I don’t
think you need any recommendation. You are a good man; only bad people
need recommendations.” But he was very innocent, and he told me, “If you
can go to the jails and help these people...”</p><p><br></p><p>I had time, and I started going to the jails. I asked all the
superintendents, “Has any criminal who has murdered, raped, done any
other major crime, ever gone mad?” And the answer was always no.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Have you ever thought about it? – that outside, people go
mad? These are the people who should go mad, if your theologies and your
religions and your so-called philosophies are right, because they have
done everything that you think is wrong. But they are so innocent,
simple.”</p><p>They said, “We have never thought about it.” It seems nobody is
concerned with the basic human evolution. These criminals are so
innocent, because they don’t have anything repressed; that is their
innocence. And because they don’t have anything repressed, madness is
impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not saying that everybody should start committing crimes to
avoid madness and to become innocent. What I am saying is that this can
give you an indication that energies should not be collected. They
should be used. And if we live in a right society, they will be used
creatively. The same violence which kills a man can sculpt a beautiful
Gautam Buddha, because as far as the hand is concerned, it releases
energy whether you cut off somebody’s head or you cut stones or you cut
wood. It doesn’t matter to the hand and to the energy – the energy is
released.</p><p><br></p><p>I have known many hunters in India – accidentally, because I was
touring all over India, and I was often a guest in a maharaja’s palace.
And all these maharajas – and there were hundreds in India – and their
sons and their brothers, they were all hunters. They had their own
forests reserved for their hunting. But I found them very human. Their
hunting was taking all their violence. You could see from their faces
that there was no tension.</p><p><br></p><p>But hunting animals is also violence. We can find ways in which the
energy can be used and yet no harm happens to anybody; on the contrary,
something beautiful is created.</p><p><br></p><p>In one of our therapy groups a man’s hand was fractured, and it got
immense publicity against me – although I was not involved in any way; I
was not present in the therapy group. But nobody asked the man
himself.</p><p><br></p><p>I called him and asked him, “What is your feeling? How are you
feeling?” – the fracture was now healed, the plaster had been
removed.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am amazed. I have always had the feeling that I could
murder somebody. Since the fracture of the hand that feeling has
disappeared. I don’t know what has happened, how it has happened, but
since that time I am feeling very humble; otherwise I was very
arrogant.” Perhaps his hand was collecting violence and he was
repressing it. The fracture released the energy.</p><p><br></p><p>I was condemned all over the world by the newspapers, that in my
therapy groups violence is being used. But I was amazed: not a single
journalist had the sense to have an interview with the man and enquire
what had been his experience. His experience was totally different. He
was feeling fortunate that it happened, because a load that he was
carrying from his childhood had simply disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>So one thing: we should understand every energy – its mechanics, its
working – and give it expression.</p><p><br></p><p>I had a meditation specially for laughing and many people came to me
and told me that it was something they had never experienced, that it
was almost psychedelic. And it was nothing: just a group was sitting,
and they would start laughing. One would start, then naturally it would
catch others; others would simply laugh because “this idiot is laughing
for no reason.” Then others would laugh at them, and soon it would
become a collective unconscious phenomenon: everybody was laughing as
they had never laughed but had always wanted to.</p><p>And it looked hysterical because they wanted to stop it but they were
not able to stop it. They had opened a door that they were not able to
close – and that made them laugh even more. “This is strange! Nothing is
happening, there is nothing to laugh at, and I am laughing like a
madman.” And this made them laugh more! And it is catching, contagious.
After one hour’s laughter they were all relaxing because they were
tired, but a great peace... They had released an energy which society
does not allow you unless there is a proper occasion.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to go to a movie, you have to read a book, you have to talk
gossips, meaningless, just to release it. But why not simply release it?
Sit in a corner and start it. You will think that it will be difficult;
it won’t be difficult, it will be very simple. Once you start, then it
goes on increasing on its own.</p><p><br></p><p>I have developed many meditations simply to help you unburden. And
anybody who has come as an outsider to see will think, “These people are
mad! Why are they laughing?” – as if the energy needs any “why.” It has
to be expressed. All the energies have to be expressed. Those which can
be creative, make them creative; those which cannot be made creative,
make them harmless. And you will be surprised that as you release
energies, you are unburdened and you are saner. There is less
possibility of you ever falling into madness.</p><p><br></p><p>And secondly, you will find fresher energies arising in you. We are
continuously creating in ourselves, by food, by breathing, by exercise,
by the sun, by the moon, by the stars... from everywhere energy is being
poured into us. And you are carrying loads of stale energy because you
don’t have space for the new energy. It is always good to have fresh and
new energy, because that will keep you younger, fresher, sharper, more
intelligent and more innocent.</p><p><br></p><p>The meditation looked hysterical – it was not. It was releasing
hysteria; otherwise you were keeping it in. And it is good if you feel
anything like that in you, just sit in your room and laugh. It is your
room, and it is nobody’s business to interfere, unless somebody wants to
join – he can join. And you will be surprised that by and by others will
join, and you will find that everybody has come. First perhaps they had
come just to see what is happening, and then seeing it, they will get
triggered and they will become part of it.</p><p><br></p><p>In Japan there was an enlightened man called Hotei, whose only
teaching was laughter. He would laugh, his disciples would laugh. His
disciples would laugh because, “This is absolutely absurd! A buddha has
never laughed! All the buddhas have been serious; this Hotei is simply
falling out of the category of buddhas.” But his laughter was catching,
and then others who would be judging him would start laughing, and it
would spread like a fire amongst his disciples, and for hours they would
enjoy... until everybody had fallen on the floor, asleep. They had
laughed so much that they were like small babies, lying down.</p><p><br></p><p>Hotei was very much condemned by other so-called religious people,
but people like Hotei don’t care. They say, “Who bothers? This is my
teaching, this is my way. And if you can laugh all the way towards
enlightenment then why choose another way!”</p><p><br></p><p>And many of his disciples became enlightened just by laughing. They
became so innocent, so unburdened; slowly slowly they understood what
the man was doing, and they were grateful. By teaching perhaps he would
not have been so helpful, but he had found something existential. He</p><p>would move from one place to another place with his group of
disciples, and wherever he was, the people were laughing – even the
people in the town were laughing hearing the noise that Hotei’s people
were making. They were simply laughing – “We have never heard that
religion has anything to do with laughter!” But seeing this buddha,
seeing Hotei himself and Hotei’s disciples, they had to recognize that
“Whatever their way may be – a little berserk, bizarre – Hotei has
changed people’s lives; he has made them saner.”</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>SOMETHING YOU SAID STRUCK ME LIKE A GONG. YOU SAID – OR I HEARD –
THAT ENLIGHTENMENT IS THE LAST EXPERIENCE OF THE MIND. CAN YOU ELABORATE
ON THIS PLEASE?</p><p><br></p><p>It looks very contradictory to my other statements. I have said again
and again that enlightenment is beyond mind. So naturally when you heard
it, that I am saying enlightenment is the last experience of the mind,
the contradiction was absolutely clear. But you have to understand
something very subtle: experience as such needs a mind. What experience
it is, does not matter, because experience means duality: the
experiencer and the experienced.</p><p><br></p><p>So what I have said before was just to help you drop the mind. My
words are devices, not statements. What I said yesterday was actually
the fact. It is the mind’s last experience – because for experience mind
is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>If there is no mind, there is no experience. You are, but you cannot
talk about any experience of bliss, of ecstasy, of godliness, of
nirvana. You cannot talk.</p><p><br></p><p>And the problem for me is that unless I give you these incentives,
why should you bother to be enlightened? If with the mind gone,
enlightenment is also gone, and just eternal silence prevails – that too
you cannot say is your experience. You are no more. That old world of
subject and object, I and you, does not exist.</p><p><br></p><p>You should also try to understand the difficulty of the master, just
the way the master tries to understand your difficulties. His
difficulties are far greater.</p><p><br></p><p>I have to give you an incentive, encouragement. The idea of being
blissful, the idea of being enlightened, the idea of attaining the
truth, somehow catches a few people’s minds, and they start moving in
that direction. Finally they will find that all these things will happen
– but they will still be of the mind. Don’t stop at that. But that can
be said only to those who have traveled the path. There is something
more than experience that is beyond mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha used two words. For enlightenment he uses a word:
nirvana. But he knows that there is still a step more, so he calls it
mahaparinirvana.</p><p><br></p><p>The word nirvana itself means attaining to a state of silence so deep
that no self exists – because that is also a disturbance. Nothing
exists. You are in a state of selflessness, but still it is an
experience, so you may not be seeing the self but the self is
experiencing it as a selfless state.</p><p>It is difficult to bring even this experience into language, but
there is something more, which is absolutely difficult: he calls it
mahaparinirvana. And he does not define it; he does not say what it
means. You have to experience it – that he leaves to you. Up to nirvana
he is willing to explain, because mind, in a very subtle way, still
exists to experience the selflessness, the silence, the blissfulness.
But when the mind is completely gone... So he has made a word in which
nirvana is there: maha means bigger, higher, greater than nirvana; and
pari means transcendental. So to translate it will mean: a selflessness
which is greater than the selflessness you experienced in nirvana,
because now there is no experiencer.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot call it an experience; hence he calls it parinirvana. It
transcends everything that can be conceived, because anything that you
can conceive is conceived by the mind. We have to use the mind for a
certain stage, but we cannot say that with the mind we have achieved the
ultimate.</p><p><br></p><p>So nirvana is the last milestone from where the road ends. Beyond
that one has simply to go and see. Just to indicate it, he calls it
mahaparinirvana: the great transcendental selflessness.</p><p><br></p><p>The problem is that I had to talk to many kinds of people all my
life, and I had to talk the way they can understand; otherwise it is
pointless. Slowly slowly I gathered my own people, and I started talking
irrespective of whether they understand or not, because I knew they
loved me: they will try to understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>But many of them could not rise to that level where they are ready to
understand, in spite of themselves, something that goes beyond their
heads. But now I am going to talk only to those people whom I can
completely forget when I am talking. I can trust that they will manage
to get at least a certain sense and taste of it.</p><p><br></p><p>So you will find more and more contradictions because now I will not
be talking to you, I will be simply saying whatever is the case –
whether you can understand it or not. If you don’t understand, you can
go on asking questions, but before I leave the world I have to complete
what I have started. I cannot leave my garden unfinished.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part30>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

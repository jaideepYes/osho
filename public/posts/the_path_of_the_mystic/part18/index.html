I WAS HIT FOR BEING JUDGMENTAL AND OPINIONATED, YET URGED TO BE “DISCRIMINATING.” NOW I FEEL THAT SOMETHING IN MY INTELLIGENCE IS BLOCKED, IMPAIRED, HESITANT AND AFRAID. EVEN IN SANNYAS, I HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY HIT FOR BEING JUDGMENTAL WHEN OFTEN I FELT MY STATEMENTS WERE RELEVANT AND VALID.\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JUDGMENT, DISCRIMINATION, AND TRUE CLARITY? AND HOW IS A CHILD, OR A FORTY-THREE-YEAR-OLD MAN, TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE?\nWOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?\nMind cannot be nonjudgmental. If you force it to be nonjudgmental, there will arise a block in your intelligence. Then the mind cannot function perfectly.\nTo be nonjudgmental is not something which comes within the area of the mind. Only a man who has gone beyond mind can be nonjudgmental; until then what appears to you to be factual, a valid statement, is just an appearance.\nEverything that mind decides or states is polluted by its conditioning, by its prejudices – that’s what makes it judgmental.\nFor example, you see a thief. It is a fact he has been stealing – no question about it – and you make a statement about the thief. And certainly stealing is not good, so when you call a man a thief your mind says, “It is valid. Your statement is true.”\nBut why is a thief bad? – and what is badness? Why has he been forced to steal? And the act of stealing is a single act: on the grounds of a single act you are making a judgment about the whole person. You are calling him a thief. He does many other things too, not only stealing. He may be a good painter, he may be a good carpenter, he may be a good singer, a good dancer – there can be a thousand and one qualities in the man. The whole man is so big, and the fact of stealing is a single action.\nOn the grounds of a single act, you cannot make a statement about the whole person. You don’t know the person at all. And you don’t even know in what conditions the act happened. Perhaps in those conditions you would have stolen too. Perhaps in those conditions stealing was not bad... because every act is relative to conditions.\nI have told you many times the story of when Lao Tzu was made the supreme judge of China. The first case was against a thief who had taken almost half the treasures of the richest man in the capital. And he was caught red-handed, so there was no question about his stealing. He had confessed too, that he had stolen.\nStill, Lao Tzu called the man whose house the thief had broken into and stolen from, and told the man, “According to me, you are both criminals. Why in the first place have you accumulated so much wealth? The whole capital is starving and poor. You cannot eat your wealth and you go on exploiting these people, sucking their blood.\n“This man was forced to steal. His mother is dying. He could not find a doctor who would come without asking for money; he could not get medicine without money. He is knocking on every door to get employment, and there is no employment. What do you want this man to do? He is ready to work, but work is not available. He has begged the doctors, but nobody is ready to listen. They say, ‘Every day thousands of poor people are coming. How can we manage?’ And from where can he get those costly medicines? It was as a last resort. This man is not a thief. Stealing was a last resort to save his dying mother.\n“And to steal from your house is certainly not a crime. In the first place you have committed the basic crime of accumulating the wealth. And this thief, this so-called thief, is a man with a very fair mind: he has taken only half of the treasure. He could have taken all of it. He has left half of your treasure in your safe; he has simply divided it half and half.\n“He is not a thief. Circumstances forced him to be a thief. But you are a born thief. Your father was exploiting these people, your father’s father was exploiting these people; you are doing the same. Because of you the whole place is poor and dying, starving.\n“Now what do you want me to judge? I send you both to jail for six months. I am being unfair to the thief, because he has done a very small thing, while you are a born criminal and are stealing the whole day from the poor in different ways. And he has done only one act.”\nThe rich man was certainly annoyed. He was not accustomed to listening to such things – he could have purchased these supreme court judges. He said, “You wait. First I would like to see the emperor.” Even the emperor owed him money. When there was the need he had given money to the emperor for invading other countries or for defense.\nHe went to the emperor and said, “What kind of a man have you put as your supreme court chief justice? He is throwing me into jail for six months – with the thief! And he says he is being unfair to the thief because he has done only one act of stealing, and we have been doing the same thing in different names for generations; our whole life consists of exploitation. Remember, if I am going to jail, tomorrow your number is going to be up, because from where have you gathered all this money, all this empire? According to that man you are a bigger thief than me. If you want to save yourself, throw that man out.”\nLao Tzu was relieved immediately. He said, “I told you before that I would not be suitable, because I don’t function through the mind. To function through the mind is judgmental. I function through silence. I simply see the reality as it is – without any prejudice, without any opinion, without any conclusion reached before.”\nOne of the courts in America had a case against me and the judge was choosing the jurors. Eleven jurors were needed, and he had to interview sixty persons, eminent persons of the area. He simply asked, “Can you be unprejudiced towards this man?” And they said they could not; they had an opinion about me. They were rejected. They could not find eleven jurors who could say, taking the oath, that they would not be prejudiced. Finally the judge had to take the case into his own hands. But what is the guarantee that the judge is not judgmental?\nThere is a case against me in Bengal in India. It is so absurd that even somebody who knows nothing of law will cancel it at first glance. The day I entered India, in the first press conference I said a few things. From faraway Bengal, from an interior town, a summons reached me that a case was filed against me because I had made statements which had hurt this man’s religious feelings.\nAnd in his application he says that the statement that has hurt him from my press conference is printed in a Bengali newspaper. The date, the column, the page – everything he has given. And the magistrate immediately issued a summons. We looked in Delhi for the Bengali paper, because I had never made any statement which had hurt his feelings. There was a press conference just on my arrival, but there was no question of my making any statement that would hurt the religious feelings of a Bengali far away.\nThere was no statement: we got hold of the Bengali newspaper – in the Bengali paper there was no statement! My press report was there, but the statement he was talking about was not there. Now do you need any knowledge of law to dismiss this case? He is basing the case on a newspaper report in which what he says is not reported!\nWithout any difficulty, the case has to be dismissed: “You are mad! Where is the statement?” But it seems the judge himself was part of the game, because he has the same mind as the other people. As far as the mind is concerned... you have not been able to create a state of no-mind in your judges. They are Hindus, they are Mohammedans, they are socialists, they are communists – how can they be nonjudgmental?\nWe appealed in the high court of Calcutta, and I was really surprised.… The case is so absurd. When the statement is not there in the paper in which he says it is... it is simply a lie. In fact, the man should be immediately caught for trying to create a bogus case.\nOne of our sannyasins, Tathagata, went – he is an attorney, a high court attorney – and he presented the case to the supreme court. He showed the newspaper, and he said, “There is no statement at all. These are other papers’ reports. No other paper has reported anything. And this is the Bengali paper that that gentleman is quoting. Those lines are not here at all. So you simply quash this.”\nBut even the supreme court said, “It cannot be quashed so easily when somebody’s religious feelings are hurt. It will have to go through a trial.”\nThey knew that they would lose the case, but even the high court judges wanted to harass me, at least for a few hearings. And they would not grant that my attorney could attend... because there was no need for me. What could I have to say? – because I had said nothing. So just to harass me... These people all had their opinions; and they were projecting their own opinions. Mind cannot do otherwise.\nSo when parents teach their children not to be judgmental – and children are very clear that their parents are continuously judgmental – on one hand they lose respect from the children and on the other hand the children become hypocrites. Parents are judgmental but they start saying, “This is not judgmental; we are simply stating the fact.”\nIt is not only that they are saying it to others, they say it to themselves. They convince themselves that this is simply a fact. But the problem is, even a fact may be just your opinion. In somebody else’s opinion it may not be a fact, it may be a fiction. For example, God is a fact to millions of people’s minds, and I say it is a fiction – the greatest fiction, the biggest lie.\nYou may think something is good, but you have got the idea of good from others – it is borrowed. So you are simply reflecting the society’s mind in saying that something is good, something is bad, something is beautiful, something is ugly. And you are absolutely certain that it is a fact.\nBut I will tell you how these facts disappear when you just look a little more deeply, with a little more awareness. For example, you may think some woman is beautiful; not only you may think so, it may be decided by a whole committee of judges that she is Miss America or Miss Germany, but every country has its own idea of beauty. Because you live in a certain area where everybody is convinced along with you, you never suspect that there may be other people who cannot think of her as beautiful.\nIn the East, none of those women who are chosen in the West as the most beautiful can be recognized as the most beautiful. The West goes about it very mechanically: the proportions of the body in inches, their weight – things which are not considered by other individuals to be beautiful. Each section has a few marks – the facial beauty, the proportions of the body, the weight of the bodyBut before falling in love with a woman has anybody ever made arrangements to weigh her\nand to measure her and then to decide if she is really beautiful?\nI have seen these women’s pictures, and I could not believe it, because in the East so little weight will not be accepted as beautiful. The East has a different concept of a woman. You can see the\nstatues of Khajuraho. That will give you the idea of what the East thinks beautiful. The woman must have some fat, because the woman’s basic function is to be a mother. In the West she is dieting in order to go into the competition, so all flesh disappears from the body and she is just a skeleton.\nIn the East, a woman a little on the fatter side will be accepted, because the fat is your reservoir, food, and the woman’s basic function is to be a mother. Now just a skeleton woman, howsoever proportionate the body, cannot become a mother. She does not have enough fat, because for nine months it will be difficult for her to eat; she will have to live on her own fat. If she has no fat it is impossible for her to become a mother. And she needs breasts which can feed the child. That is part of her beauty in the Eastern concept.\nSo East and West will not agree on the same woman as beautiful. And if you consider other countries and other continents, like China, then there will be different things coming into it. Or Japan, then some other things – the grace of the woman... Now a woman who parades almost naked in front of thousands of people is not graceful. She is almost selling her body. All these competitions are pornographic. The people have come there to see different naked women; they are not interested in the contest.\nBut in India or Japan you cannot have that kind of contest. You will need a totally different perspective. The grace of the woman will be the basic thing, and that is not considered at all in the Western concept of beauty.\nWhen Westerners reached China for the first time, they wrote home in letters, “These people are not human: they don’t look like human beings, they are a very strange type. It must be some other animal that looks a little bit like man” – because they had never thought that a beard with six hairs is possible! And cheekbones protruding so much cannot be accepted.\nBut the Chinese also wrote about the Westerners who visited, and the records are still available. “They look like monkeys. Perhaps Charles Darwin was right, but he was right only about these Western people, that they are evolved out of monkeys. Their behavior is so uncentered; their individuality is so without grace.”\nNow both are judging. Both are judgmental; neither is open. Neither is looking at the other without an opinion accumulated in childhood, from living in a certain society with a certain kind of people.\nIn India there is a section of Hindu society called Marwaris. They live in Rajasthan, but they have only their houses in Rajasthan; their businesses are all over India. Once in a while they come home; otherwise they are working everywhere. They are very clever businessmen.\nI used to be very familiar with a Marwari family. Their daughter was going to be married, and the family who was going to take her as their daughter-in-law was enquiring about them in the town: what kind of people are they? And somebody said they should ask me because I was very intimate with those people. So they asked me. I was puzzled, because they asked me one question: “How many times have they been bankrupt?”\nI said, “This is a strange question!”\nThey said, “No, it is not strange. In our society this is the way we count the richness of a person. We don’t go bankrupt because we have lost the business or have had losses; no, we go bankrupt when we are at the peak. Each bankruptcy means at least one million rupees. So that is a simple way to count how much money this family has. If they have been bankrupt three times, that is good. If they have never been bankrupt then this marriage cannot happen, because if they have not been bankrupt at all then they will not have enough money to give in dowry to the daughter. We cannot ask directly – that is thought to be ugly – so we have to enquire indirectly.”\nNow that way of thinking is special to them. I don’t think anybody in the world will think that a person who has been bankrupt seven times has any wealth. And when they go bankrupt in one place, that place becomes unexploitable for them. They have exploited people so much and then gone bankrupt! They are pretending that they don’t have any money.\nSo they move. Their real home is in Rajasthan; these are their temporary places where they earn and go bankrupt. Then they move from that town to another town far away where nobody knows that they have gone bankrupt. Again they start a business; again they will accumulate a lot of money and again the bankruptcy.\nAnd all the money that goes on accumulating goes to Rajasthan, to their home. These other places are just for exploitation. They keep moving. Within five to seven years every Marwari moves, because in those seven years he has gained the confidence of people, managed to accumulate money, borrowed money, done everything he can do, and then he goes bankrupt.\nNobody else will say that bankruptcy is good, but if you are a Marwari, then be bankrupt as many times as you can manage! Then your prestige, your respectability, rises higher. Anywhere else, if you are bankrupt, your prestige falls down.\nThere is a tribe in India where, when they marry their daughter to anybody – it is an aboriginal tribe – they enquire how many crimes the boy has committed, because that is thought to be maturity. He has been to jail, he has learned the ways of life – in any case their daughter is not going to starve. They are giving their daughter to a con man!\nWhen I came to know about these people... Even murder is valuable because that means they are giving their daughter to a man who is capable of everything, including murder. Their daughter will be safe under his protection and there will be no problems, because he is a thief, he has been in jail – he knows everything... how to cheat people, exploit people, con people. That seems to be his qualification – but only in their tribe. Outside their tribe everything will be condemned. Who is going to marry their daughter to a man who is a murderer or who has been visiting jails often or who has committed all kinds of crimes? That will be a DISqualification.\nIf you look around the world and you see different people’s conditionings, and their ideas of good and bad, right and wrong, you will be able to see for the first time that your mind is also part of a certain section of humanity. It does not represent anything about truth; it simply represents that certain section of humanity. And through this mind, whatever you see is judgmental.\nEven your judges, who need to be impartial, are not impartial – cannot be. It should be made a clear condition that before a person becomes a judge he should go through deep meditation. He\nshould renounce his religion, he should renounce any other kind of political ideology; he should renounce the past. Unless he proves his emptiness, that he is coming clean and clear, he will not be appointed as a judge. Only then can you expect that his findings will be factual – because he has no certain opinions beforehand. Otherwise they judge before they have even listened. They have already made up their minds long before.\nAnd the same is true about everybody. If that is the case with judges who are expected to be absolutely nonjudgmental, to give equal opportunity to both sides of the case, to all the aspects of the case, and not bring their own opinion in... but that opinion is already in!\nSo I can understand your problem, but that block can be removed. Your parents have taught you not to be judgmental so you have tried not to be judgmental. But you cannot manage it because through the mind you can only be judgmental. So you will just change the name: you will say, “I am stating a fact. It is a statement of fact.” But it cannot be a statement of fact.\nWith the mind nothing is your own, actual perception. Only with deep meditation, when you become disconnected from the mind and you can put the mind aside, can you state the fact, can you state the truth.\nSo what your parents were trying... they were trying the right thing with the wrong means. And that’s what their parents have done with them: “Don’t be judgmental.” But then what can mind do? Mind cannot do otherwise. Nobody was teaching you how to be a no-mind, and only out of a state of no- mind can something come which will be simply the fact, without the interference of your prejudices.\nIn my high school days, it was almost every day that I was sent at least once to the principal’s office to be punished for something or other. I did not think at that time – nor do I think now – that what I had done was wrong, but the principal, the teacher, they had their opinions.\nFor example, what can be wrong if I come to school riding on a horse? I don’t think there is anything wrong in it, although in that part of the country nobody goes to school riding on a horse. Riding on a horse means creating havoc. All the students would gather there and say, “Now you have found a new thing!”\nAnd the man whose horse I had taken was coming, running after me! I did not have any horse. In that town there were no horses except the horses that pulled a certain vehicle called a tanga. So there were tanga horses and whenever there was no train at the station all the horses were waiting in front of their houses eating grass. Any horse would do: I would simply get hold of it and ride it to the high school.\nNow, my situation was: “What is wrong in it?” And their problem was that I unnecessarily created a disturbance. Now all the classes had stopped, and the students had run out to see what I had done today! The teachers were standing there shouting, “Don’t go out!” But nobody was listening. And the man was shouting, “The horse is mine! And this is strange, because this is train time and I have to go and catch the train and the passengers... and this boy suddenly jumped on my horse and brought it here!” So my principal became accustomed...\nI said to the man whose horse it was, “How much are you going to get from the passengers? That much money I will give to you – forget this train. Why are you making an unnecessary fuss? You\ndon’t make much money: if you can make one rupee for taking four passengers from the train to the town, that is more than you can expect. So you take one rupee and have a good time, because you will not be wasting time going to the station. And I have been telling you, Since I rode your horse, I will give you one rupee. Don’t be worried, but let me first reach my place. ”\nI gave the rupee to the man, and he was perfectly happy. He said, “If this is the case, you can take my horse any time.”\nI said to the headmaster, the principal, “You can see it: the man is happy, the horse is happy. Nobody is disturbed. If the students have run out, that is between you and your students. But in the school code there is nothing that prevents anybody from coming on a horse. I have read the school code many times and I have marked places in it, the loopholes that I can use.”\nAnd they said, “We had never thought that anybody would use the school code against the school. It is true that there is no rule preventing it.”\n“Then why is there so much anger against me?”\nEvery day it was something or other. The principal used to tell me, “Just open your hand,” and he would hit my hand with his cane. He stopped even asking what I had done.\nAnd I said to him, “This is better: don’t ask me, because even after asking me, you punish me, so what is the point of all this? They bring me here, you just punish me, and I go back.”\nOne day it happened – a very rare thing – the teacher found the captain of the class smoking in the class, and that was a very great crime. He said to me, “This captain has been taking you to the principal every day; today you take him.”\nI said, “Perfectly good – although I don’t agree with you. Remember the school code: no clause says that a student cannot smoke in the class. So I will take him to the principal, but I will make everything clear to him. And you should remember that you have been smoking in the class and we have not reported it simply because it is not in the code.”\nSo I took the captain. The teacher came running behind me, and halfway there he said, “Don’t mention about me, because I am a new, temporary appointment; they may throw me out.”\nI said, “Okay, I will not mention you, but you stop smoking in the class.” He said, “I promise.”\nI took the captain, but the principal was so accustomed to beating me that he did not ask who has brought whom. He simply said, “Open your hands,” so I opened my hands and he started beating them.\nI said, “Do it, but you will repent.” He said, “Why should I repent?”\nI said, “Today things are different. I have brought this boy; I am not the criminal today. And you have already hit my hands. Now give me the cane and open your hands; otherwise I am going to create great trouble for you. First open your hands and I will hit you exactly the three times that you have hit me on my hands.”\nHe said, “But...!”\nI said, “There is no question of ‘But!’ You did not ask me. You have not been asking for many days. I have been silent, but this is too much.” He had to open his hand, and I hit him three times and I told him, “Remember it.”\nHe said, “I will remember it my whole life, because being a principal... a student is hitting me. How can I forget it! But please don’t spread it all around.”\nI said, “I will not say anything to anybody, but I cannot say anything about this boy. He will say something; he will have to say something.”\nThe principal asked, “What do you mean, ‘He will have to say something’?” I said, “I will make him say something. I will not say anything.”\n“How can you force him to say something?”\nI said, “First I will protect him. He has been found smoking in the class; that’s why he has been sent here. But there is no reason... you open your school code: where is it written that no student can smoke inside the class? Inside or outside, smoking is not prohibited. It was not mentioned because nobody ever thought that any student would smoke in the class.”\nHe said, “Yes, that’s true. We will have to make an amendment.”\nI said, “First you make an amendment, and then we will see; but right now you cannot punish him. And because I am saving him, he will have to spread the news.”\nThe principal said, “You seem to be strange. Have you come to study in this school or are you simply creating trouble?”\n“I am not creating trouble. It is a simple bargain. I have saved him, and you have been beaten. Now it is his duty to spread it all over the school. I will keep absolutely silent.” And without my saying, the boy did it, because he was very happy that I had taken him to be punished and I protected him instead.\nI asked the principal that day, “You smoke, and almost every teacher in the school smokes, except one or two; then why this antagonism against smoking? And if smoking is bad, then you should start stopping the teachers, because the students will follow the teachers.”\nParents smoke and don’t allow their children to smoke; they simply create hypocrites. The children smoke, hiding here and there. This is a very clumsy society. Nobody knows exactly what they are\ntrying to do, or how it can be done. They all say, “Don’t judge” – but how to avoid being judgmental when on the other hand you are telling everybody, “This is good, this is bad, this is right, that is wrong”?\nThe whole teaching of your morality is judgmental, and in that very teaching this is also one part: “Don’t be judgmental.” You are creating confusion, and the only way the child will be able to survive this confusion is to become a hypocrite. He will judge and he will say that he is not judgmental. And he will believe that his judgment is a valid fact. But the reality is such that there is no valid fact: even science has only relative facts, no valid facts. It can only be said that hypothetically it is true. Tomorrow it may change; more research may change it.\nJust a hundred years ago science was very stubborn about saying that whatever it said was a solid statement of reality. Now it is not so. The situation has come to a point where now you cannot write a big book on modern science, because by the time your book is finished everything that you have written will be out of date. So today there are only small periodicals and papers that are immediately printed and distributed and read in conferences, because you cannot be certain about tomorrow. Tomorrow somebody will find some other fact and your whole work will collapse.\nEverything is relative.\nMind cannot find the ultimate.\nMind cannot find the solid fact, because that is what truth is. It can find only approximate fictions which, somehow for the moment, help you to understand reality and to work with it.\nSo don’t make it a problem and don’t try to solve it at the level of the mind. Mind is condemned to be judgmental. So don’t try to do what cannot be done. What can be done is to slip out of the mind. Slowly slowly go beyond the mind, and start looking from a witnessing silence. Perhaps then what you see is the truth.\nThere is a Sufi story of Junnaid. One of his disciples said to him, “I trust in you absolutely.”\nJunnaid said, “Don’t say such a thing because you are still in the mind, and absolute trust is not a quality of the mind. You have come here to me to reach the state where you can be in absolute trust, but right now don’t say that.”\nBut the disciple was stubborn. He said, “I trust you. And it is not something that can be shaken or taken away. I can give my life, but I will not drop my trust.”\nJunnaid said, “That I can believe. You can give your life, but as far as trust is concerned we will see later on.”\nA few days afterwards the disciple saw Junnaid sitting with a woman on the other side of the lake. That was a great shock, because Sufi mystics are not allowed to be with women. And not only that: the woman was pouring wine into a cup for Junnaid. Junnaid took the cup and drank the wine. And Sufis are against any kind of alcoholic beverages!\nIt was too much. The disciple went to the other side of the lake and said to Junnaid, “You have killed my trust.”\nJunnaid said, “I told you before that trust by the mind is not of much value.”\nThe disciple said, “Don’t try to still be a master. You have been cheating people! You are drinking wine, you are sitting with a woman.” Of course the woman had a black veil on as Mohammedan women do.\nJunnaid said, “Taste the wine. It is nothing but water, just colored so it looks like wine.” The disciple tasted it. He was puzzled. He asked, “But why did you do it?”\nAnd Junnaid said, “Turn back the veil of the woman – she is my mother.”\nHe turned back the veil; she was Junnaid’s mother. He fell at Junnaid’s feet and said, “Forgive me.”\nJunnaid said, “There is no need. I simply wanted to make it clear to you not to say things through the mind which the mind cannot manage: absolute truth, absolute trust. Now just a woman sitting by my side – if you had trust, you would not have bothered about it. That is not your business. You are not my master. You have not become my disciple on the condition that I will not sit by the side of a woman. You have not made the condition that you will be my disciple if I don’t drink wine, so why should you be disturbed?”\nThe poor disciple was simply repeating his social conditioning. But one thing was clear now: to say things which the mind is not capable of saying is wrong.\nSo you need not be bothered about what your father said to you. All that is past, just dust on the mirror. Clean the mirror and come to a state where silence prevails. Then whatever you see or say will be a statement of fact because you don’t have any opinion. But carrying those opinions along with you and trying to be nonjudgmental is fighting with yourself unnecessarily. And that fight is blocking your intelligence.\nAny fight splits you into two. Any fight within you is dangerous to your intelligence. When you are not fighting with anything within you, when everything is calm and quiet, your intelligence has its total flavor, sharpness, beauty. And intelligence is our only treasure. It is through intelligence that we are going to find out everything about the mysteries of life.\nBut don’t create a conflict. And don’t be angry with your father. What he did must have been done to him. So parents simply go on transferring diseases from generation to generation; it is an unconscious process.\nYou can jump out of that whole vicious circle just with the simple alertness that whatever they have taught you they themselves were not aware of. They meant well, but they created a confusion in you.\nQuestion 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nAS I LOOK TO SEE WHAT MY QUESTION IS I REMEMBER THE SAYING, “WHEN THERE IS LOVE, EVERYTHING IS BEAUTIFUL. AND WHEN THERE IS NO LOVE, ALL IS UGLY.” DO ALL MY QUESTIONS AND APPARENT PROBLEMS ARISE AS A RESULT OF BEING OUT OF TOUCH WITH MY HEART?\nThe second part of your question is right. All questions, not only yours but everybody’s, arise because you are not in touch with the heart. Mind is a question producing mechanism. It cannot find any answer, but it can produce millions of questions.\nThe heart has the answer.\nThe questions may be millions, but the answer is one. So if you are in touch with your heart, your questions disappear. This is the second part of your question.\nBut the first part is a totally different thing. You say, “When there is love everything looks beautiful, and when there is no love everything looks ugly.” That is an hallucination.\nLove creates a kind of hallucination. You are happy, you are joyous, you are covered with a haze of joy, and you project on everybody the same joy, the same beauty that you are feeling – but it is a projection, it is not a reality. And when the love disappears from your heart and turns sour or becomes hate, the same people start looking ugly. That too is a projection. Neither the first nor the second has anything to do with the reality of the people or things around you.\nIf you want to really know the truth about people, you have to go beyond all dualisms. Love and hate, day and night, life and death – all kinds of dualisms have to be dropped. And that is possible only by being a witness. Then you are a mirror. Then you simply mirror, you don’t state anything.\nWhether or not a person standing in front of you is beautiful, the mirror says nothing; it simply reflects the person. If the person is ugly, the mirror says nothing; it simply reflects the ugly person. The witnessing consciousness simply reflects. It does not state, but it understands. What is the point of saying to anybody, “You are ugly”? What is the point of saying to someone, “You are beautiful”? – because whatever you say to people, your opinion becomes a disturbance in their life.\nThe witnessing consciousness is a very silent observer. It knows but it does not say. There is no need. A is A, B is B. What is the point of saying it? Why create disturbances in other people’s minds?\nLove is not a state of awakening. It is a kind of drug, it is hormonal.\nI have heard about one supreme court chief justice in America. When he retired from the supreme court he had only one wish. Sixty years earlier he and his wife had got married and had gone to Paris for their honeymoon. His name was Parry, and he had only one wish: before they die they should again go to Paris.\nSo after retirement the first thing he did was take his old wife to Paris. They stayed in the same hotel, in the same room. They went to visit the same places – but something was missing. Finally\nParry said to his wife, “Paris has changed so much – no longer that juice that used to be here, no longer that beauty, no longer that colorfulness. Everything seems to be stale, flat. I was thinking that in sixty years Paris would have become even juicier. I have not come here for this disillusionment.”\nHis wife said, “If you don’t mind, I would like to say that Paris is still the same Paris; it is Parry who has changed. We are now old, we have lost our juice. That was our honeymoon; this is not our honeymoon. We are half in our graves! Sixty years ago what we saw was not true: it was a projection of a couple on their honeymoon, in great love. This is also not true: this is the illusion of an old couple who have nothing in the future but death and darkness. This is also a projection.” The wife was certainly right.\nSo your love may look as if it is giving beauty to things, and your hate, ugliness to things – but they are only projections. Don’t depend on projections. If you want to know the reality, then just be a witness. And the witness is never young, never old; it is timeless. So there is no question of youth, old age, honeymoon and graveyard. They don’t come in its path.\nWhatever the witness sees is the case. It is only a mirror.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6788","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_path_of_the_mystic/part18/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_path_of_the_mystic/>The Path of the Mystic</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">18 Intelligence is our only treasure</h1><div class=post-meta>32 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6788 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Path_of_the_Mystic/part18.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

AND INWARDLY HYPERCRITICAL OF EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE, I NOW SEE MY
CONDITIONING AS VERY MUCH OPERATING AT CROSS PURPOSES. I WAS HIT FOR
BEING JUDGMENTAL AND OPINIONATED, YET URGED TO BE “DISCRIMINATING.” NOW
I FEEL THAT SOMETHING IN MY INTELLIGENCE IS BLOCKED, IMPAIRED, HESITANT
AND AFRAID. EVEN IN SANNYAS, I HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY HIT FOR BEING
JUDGMENTAL WHEN OFTEN I FELT MY STATEMENTS WERE RELEVANT AND VALID.</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JUDGMENT, DISCRIMINATION, AND TRUE
CLARITY? AND HOW IS A CHILD, OR A FORTY-THREE-YEAR-OLD MAN, TO TELL THE
DIFFERENCE?</p><p><br></p><p>WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?</p><p><br></p><p>Mind cannot be nonjudgmental. If you force it to be nonjudgmental,
there will arise a block in your intelligence. Then the mind cannot
function perfectly.</p><p><br></p><p>To be nonjudgmental is not something which comes within the area of
the mind. Only a man who has gone beyond mind can be nonjudgmental;
until then what appears to you to be factual, a valid statement, is just
an appearance.</p><p>Everything that mind decides or states is polluted by its
conditioning, by its prejudices – that’s what makes it judgmental.</p><p>For example, you see a thief. It is a fact he has been stealing – no
question about it – and you make a statement about the thief. And
certainly stealing is not good, so when you call a man a thief your mind
says, “It is valid. Your statement is true.”</p><p>But why is a thief bad? – and what is badness? Why has he been forced
to steal? And the act of stealing is a single act: on the grounds of a
single act you are making a judgment about the whole person. You are
calling him a thief. He does many other things too, not only stealing.
He may be a good painter, he may be a good carpenter, he may be a good
singer, a good dancer – there can be a thousand and one qualities in the
man. The whole man is so big, and the fact of stealing is a single
action.</p><p>On the grounds of a single act, you cannot make a statement about the
whole person. You don’t know the person at all. And you don’t even know
in what conditions the act happened. Perhaps in those conditions you
would have stolen too. Perhaps in those conditions stealing was not
bad... because every act is relative to conditions.</p><p>I have told you many times the story of when Lao Tzu was made the
supreme judge of China. The first case was against a thief who had taken
almost half the treasures of the richest man in the capital. And he was
caught red-handed, so there was no question about his stealing. He had
confessed too, that he had stolen.</p><p>Still, Lao Tzu called the man whose house the thief had broken into
and stolen from, and told the man, “According to me, you are both
criminals. Why in the first place have you accumulated so much wealth?
The whole capital is starving and poor. You cannot eat your wealth and
you go on exploiting these people, sucking their blood.</p><p>“This man was forced to steal. His mother is dying. He could not find
a doctor who would come without asking for money; he could not get
medicine without money. He is knocking on every door to get employment,
and there is no employment. What do you want this man to do? He is ready
to work, but work is not available. He has begged the doctors, but
nobody is ready to listen. They say, ‘Every day thousands of poor people
are coming. How can we manage?’ And from where can he get those costly
medicines? It was as a last resort. This man is not a thief. Stealing
was a last resort to save his dying mother.</p><p>“And to steal from your house is certainly not a crime. In the first
place you have committed the basic crime of accumulating the wealth. And
this thief, this so-called thief, is a man with a very fair mind: he has
taken only half of the treasure. He could have taken all of it. He has
left half of your treasure in your safe; he has simply divided it half
and half.</p><p>“He is not a thief. Circumstances forced him to be a thief. But you
are a born thief. Your father was exploiting these people, your father’s
father was exploiting these people; you are doing the same. Because of
you the whole place is poor and dying, starving.</p><p>“Now what do you want me to judge? I send you both to jail for six
months. I am being unfair to the thief, because he has done a very small
thing, while you are a born criminal and are stealing the whole day from
the poor in different ways. And he has done only one act.”</p><p>The rich man was certainly annoyed. He was not accustomed to
listening to such things – he could have purchased these supreme court
judges. He said, “You wait. First I would like to see the emperor.” Even
the emperor owed him money. When there was the need he had given money
to the emperor for invading other countries or for defense.</p><p><br></p><p>He went to the emperor and said, “What kind of a man have you put as
your supreme court chief justice? He is throwing me into jail for six
months – with the thief! And he says he is being unfair to the thief
because he has done only one act of stealing, and we have been doing the
same thing in different names for generations; our whole life consists
of exploitation. Remember, if I am going to jail, tomorrow your number
is going to be up, because from where have you gathered all this money,
all this empire? According to that man you are a bigger thief than me.
If you want to save yourself, throw that man out.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu was relieved immediately. He said, “I told you before that I
would not be suitable, because I don’t function through the mind. To
function through the mind is judgmental. I function through silence. I
simply see the reality as it is – without any prejudice, without any
opinion, without any conclusion reached before.”</p><p><br></p><p>One of the courts in America had a case against me and the judge was
choosing the jurors. Eleven jurors were needed, and he had to interview
sixty persons, eminent persons of the area. He simply asked, “Can you be
unprejudiced towards this man?” And they said they could not; they had
an opinion about me. They were rejected. They could not find eleven
jurors who could say, taking the oath, that they would not be
prejudiced. Finally the judge had to take the case into his own hands.
But what is the guarantee that the judge is not judgmental?</p><p><br></p><p>There is a case against me in Bengal in India. It is so absurd that
even somebody who knows nothing of law will cancel it at first glance.
The day I entered India, in the first press conference I said a few
things. From faraway Bengal, from an interior town, a summons reached me
that a case was filed against me because I had made statements which had
hurt this man’s religious feelings.</p><p><br></p><p>And in his application he says that the statement that has hurt him
from my press conference is printed in a Bengali newspaper. The date,
the column, the page – everything he has given. And the magistrate
immediately issued a summons. We looked in Delhi for the Bengali paper,
because I had never made any statement which had hurt his feelings.
There was a press conference just on my arrival, but there was no
question of my making any statement that would hurt the religious
feelings of a Bengali far away.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no statement: we got hold of the Bengali newspaper – in the
Bengali paper there was no statement! My press report was there, but the
statement he was talking about was not there. Now do you need any
knowledge of law to dismiss this case? He is basing the case on a
newspaper report in which what he says is not reported!</p><p><br></p><p>Without any difficulty, the case has to be dismissed: “You are mad!
Where is the statement?” But it seems the judge himself was part of the
game, because he has the same mind as the other people. As far as the
mind is concerned... you have not been able to create a state of no-mind
in your judges. They are Hindus, they are Mohammedans, they are
socialists, they are communists – how can they be nonjudgmental?</p><p>We appealed in the high court of Calcutta, and I was really
surprised.… The case is so absurd. When the statement is not there in
the paper in which he says it is... it is simply a lie. In fact, the man
should be immediately caught for trying to create a bogus case.</p><p><br></p><p>One of our sannyasins, Tathagata, went – he is an attorney, a high
court attorney – and he presented the case to the supreme court. He
showed the newspaper, and he said, “There is no statement at all. These
are other papers’ reports. No other paper has reported anything. And
this is the Bengali paper that that gentleman is quoting. Those lines
are not here at all. So you simply quash this.”</p><p><br></p><p>But even the supreme court said, “It cannot be quashed so easily when
somebody’s religious feelings are hurt. It will have to go through a
trial.”</p><p><br></p><p>They knew that they would lose the case, but even the high court
judges wanted to harass me, at least for a few hearings. And they would
not grant that my attorney could attend... because there was no need for
me. What could I have to say? – because I had said nothing. So just to
harass me... These people all had their opinions; and they were
projecting their own opinions. Mind cannot do otherwise.</p><p><br></p><p>So when parents teach their children not to be judgmental – and
children are very clear that their parents are continuously judgmental –
on one hand they lose respect from the children and on the other hand
the children become hypocrites. Parents are judgmental but they start
saying, “This is not judgmental; we are simply stating the fact.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is not only that they are saying it to others, they say it to
themselves. They convince themselves that this is simply a fact. But the
problem is, even a fact may be just your opinion. In somebody else’s
opinion it may not be a fact, it may be a fiction. For example, God is a
fact to millions of people’s minds, and I say it is a fiction – the
greatest fiction, the biggest lie.</p><p><br></p><p>You may think something is good, but you have got the idea of good
from others – it is borrowed. So you are simply reflecting the society’s
mind in saying that something is good, something is bad, something is
beautiful, something is ugly. And you are absolutely certain that it is
a fact.</p><p><br></p><p>But I will tell you how these facts disappear when you just look a
little more deeply, with a little more awareness. For example, you may
think some woman is beautiful; not only you may think so, it may be
decided by a whole committee of judges that she is Miss America or Miss
Germany, but every country has its own idea of beauty. Because you live
in a certain area where everybody is convinced along with you, you never
suspect that there may be other people who cannot think of her as
beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East, none of those women who are chosen in the West as the
most beautiful can be recognized as the most beautiful. The West goes
about it very mechanically: the proportions of the body in inches, their
weight – things which are not considered by other individuals to be
beautiful. Each section has a few marks – the facial beauty, the
proportions of the body, the weight of the body<span class=s4></span>But before falling in love with a woman has anybody
ever made arrangements to weigh her</p><p>and to measure her and then to decide if she is really beautiful?</p><p><br></p><p>I have seen these women’s pictures, and I could not believe it,
because in the East so little weight will not be accepted as beautiful.
The East has a different concept of a woman. You can see the</p><p>statues of Khajuraho. That will give you the idea of what the East
thinks beautiful. The woman must have some fat, because the woman’s
basic function is to be a mother. In the West she is dieting in order to
go into the competition, so all flesh disappears from the body and she
is just a skeleton.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East, a woman a little on the fatter side will be accepted,
because the fat is your reservoir, food, and the woman’s basic function
is to be a mother. Now just a skeleton woman, howsoever proportionate
the body, cannot become a mother. She does not have enough fat, because
for nine months it will be difficult for her to eat; she will have to
live on her own fat. If she has no fat it is impossible for her to
become a mother. And she needs breasts which can feed the child. That is
part of her beauty in the Eastern concept.</p><p><br></p><p>So East and West will not agree on the same woman as beautiful. And
if you consider other countries and other continents, like China, then
there will be different things coming into it. Or Japan, then some other
things – the grace of the woman... Now a woman who parades almost naked
in front of thousands of people is not graceful. She is almost selling
her body. All these competitions are pornographic. The people have come
there to see different naked women; they are not interested in the
contest.</p><p><br></p><p>But in India or Japan you cannot have that kind of contest. You will
need a totally different perspective. The grace of the woman will be the
basic thing, and that is not considered at all in the Western concept of
beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>When Westerners reached China for the first time, they wrote home in
letters, “These people are not human: they don’t look like human beings,
they are a very strange type. It must be some other animal that looks a
little bit like man” – because they had never thought that a beard with
six hairs is possible! And cheekbones protruding so much cannot be
accepted.</p><p><br></p><p>But the Chinese also wrote about the Westerners who visited, and the
records are still available. “They look like monkeys. Perhaps Charles
Darwin was right, but he was right only about these Western people, that
they are evolved out of monkeys. Their behavior is so uncentered; their
individuality is so without grace.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now both are judging. Both are judgmental; neither is open. Neither
is looking at the other without an opinion accumulated in childhood,
from living in a certain society with a certain kind of people.</p><p><br></p><p>In India there is a section of Hindu society called Marwaris. They
live in Rajasthan, but they have only their houses in Rajasthan; their
businesses are all over India. Once in a while they come home; otherwise
they are working everywhere. They are very clever businessmen.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to be very familiar with a Marwari family. Their daughter was
going to be married, and the family who was going to take her as their
daughter-in-law was enquiring about them in the town: what kind of
people are they? And somebody said they should ask me because I was very
intimate with those people. So they asked me. I was puzzled, because
they asked me one question: “How many times have they been
bankrupt?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “This is a strange question!”</p><p>They said, “No, it is not strange. In our society this is the way we
count the richness of a person. We don’t go bankrupt because we have
lost the business or have had losses; no, we go bankrupt when we are at
the peak. Each bankruptcy means at least one million rupees. So that is
a simple way to count how much money this family has. If they have been
bankrupt three times, that is good. If they have never been bankrupt
then this marriage cannot happen, because if they have not been bankrupt
at all then they will not have enough money to give in dowry to the
daughter. We cannot ask directly – that is thought to be ugly – so we
have to enquire indirectly.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now that way of thinking is special to them. I don’t think anybody in
the world will think that a person who has been bankrupt seven times has
any wealth. And when they go bankrupt in one place, that place becomes
unexploitable for them. They have exploited people so much and then gone
bankrupt! They are pretending that they don’t have any money.</p><p><br></p><p>So they move. Their real home is in Rajasthan; these are their
temporary places where they earn and go bankrupt. Then they move from
that town to another town far away where nobody knows that they have
gone bankrupt. Again they start a business; again they will accumulate a
lot of money and again the bankruptcy.</p><p><br></p><p>And all the money that goes on accumulating goes to Rajasthan, to
their home. These other places are just for exploitation. They keep
moving. Within five to seven years every Marwari moves, because in those
seven years he has gained the confidence of people, managed to
accumulate money, borrowed money, done everything he can do, and then he
goes bankrupt.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody else will say that bankruptcy is good, but if you are a
Marwari, then be bankrupt as many times as you can manage! Then your
prestige, your respectability, rises higher. Anywhere else, if you are
bankrupt, your prestige falls down.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a tribe in India where, when they marry their daughter to
anybody – it is an aboriginal tribe – they enquire how many crimes the
boy has committed, because that is thought to be maturity. He has been
to jail, he has learned the ways of life – in any case their daughter is
not going to starve. They are giving their daughter to a con man!</p><p><br></p><p>When I came to know about these people... Even murder is valuable
because that means they are giving their daughter to a man who is
capable of everything, including murder. Their daughter will be safe
under his protection and there will be no problems, because he is a
thief, he has been in jail – he knows everything... how to cheat people,
exploit people, con people. That seems to be his qualification – but
only in their tribe. Outside their tribe everything will be condemned.
Who is going to marry their daughter to a man who is a murderer or who
has been visiting jails often or who has committed all kinds of crimes?
That will be a DISqualification.</p><p><br></p><p>If you look around the world and you see different people’s
conditionings, and their ideas of good and bad, right and wrong, you
will be able to see for the first time that your mind is also part of a
certain section of humanity. It does not represent anything about truth;
it simply represents that certain section of humanity. And through this
mind, whatever you see is judgmental.</p><p><br></p><p>Even your judges, who need to be impartial, are not impartial –
cannot be. It should be made a clear condition that before a person
becomes a judge he should go through deep meditation. He</p><p>should renounce his religion, he should renounce any other kind of
political ideology; he should renounce the past. Unless he proves his
emptiness, that he is coming clean and clear, he will not be appointed
as a judge. Only then can you expect that his findings will be factual –
because he has no certain opinions beforehand. Otherwise they judge
before they have even listened. They have already made up their minds
long before.</p><p><br></p><p>And the same is true about everybody. If that is the case with judges
who are expected to be absolutely nonjudgmental, to give equal
opportunity to both sides of the case, to all the aspects of the case,
and not bring their own opinion in... but that opinion is already
in!</p><p><br></p><p>So I can understand your problem, but that block can be removed. Your
parents have taught you not to be judgmental so you have tried not to be
judgmental. But you cannot manage it because through the mind you can
only be judgmental. So you will just change the name: you will say, “I
am stating a fact. It is a statement of fact.” But it cannot be a
statement of fact.</p><p><br></p><p>With the mind nothing is your own, actual perception. Only with deep
meditation, when you become disconnected from the mind and you can put
the mind aside, can you state the fact, can you state the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>So what your parents were trying... they were trying the right thing
with the wrong means. And that’s what their parents have done with them:
“Don’t be judgmental.” But then what can mind do? Mind cannot do
otherwise. Nobody was teaching you how to be a no-mind, and only out of
a state of no- mind can something come which will be simply the fact,
without the interference of your prejudices.</p><p><br></p><p>In my high school days, it was almost every day that I was sent at
least once to the principal’s office to be punished for something or
other. I did not think at that time – nor do I think now – that what I
had done was wrong, but the principal, the teacher, they had their
opinions.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, what can be wrong if I come to school riding on a horse?
I don’t think there is anything wrong in it, although in that part of
the country nobody goes to school riding on a horse. Riding on a horse
means creating havoc. All the students would gather there and say, “Now
you have found a new thing!”</p><p><br></p><p>And the man whose horse I had taken was coming, running after me! I
did not have any horse. In that town there were no horses except the
horses that pulled a certain vehicle called a tanga. So there were tanga
horses and whenever there was no train at the station all the horses
were waiting in front of their houses eating grass. Any horse would do:
I would simply get hold of it and ride it to the high school.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, my situation was: “What is wrong in it?” And their problem was
that I unnecessarily created a disturbance. Now all the classes had
stopped, and the students had run out to see what I had done today! The
teachers were standing there shouting, “Don’t go out!” But nobody was
listening. And the man was shouting, “The horse is mine! And this is
strange, because this is train time and I have to go and catch the train
and the passengers... and this boy suddenly jumped on my horse and
brought it here!” So my principal became accustomed...</p><p><br></p><p>I said to the man whose horse it was, “How much are you going to get
from the passengers? That much money I will give to you – forget this
train. Why are you making an unnecessary fuss? You</p><p>don’t make much money: if you can make one rupee for taking four
passengers from the train to the town, that is more than you can expect.
So you take one rupee and have a good time, because you will not be
wasting time going to the station. And I have been telling you, Since I
rode your horse, I will give you one rupee. Don’t be worried, but let me
first reach my place. ”</p><p><br></p><p>I gave the rupee to the man, and he was perfectly happy. He said, “If
this is the case, you can take my horse any time.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said to the headmaster, the principal, “You can see it: the man is
happy, the horse is happy. Nobody is disturbed. If the students have run
out, that is between you and your students. But in the school code there
is nothing that prevents anybody from coming on a horse. I have read the
school code many times and I have marked places in it, the loopholes
that I can use.”</p><p><br></p><p>And they said, “We had never thought that anybody would use the
school code against the school. It is true that there is no rule
preventing it.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then why is there so much anger against me?”</p><p><br></p><p>Every day it was something or other. The principal used to tell me,
“Just open your hand,” and he would hit my hand with his cane. He
stopped even asking what I had done.</p><p><br></p><p>And I said to him, “This is better: don’t ask me, because even after
asking me, you punish me, so what is the point of all this? They bring
me here, you just punish me, and I go back.”</p><p><br></p><p>One day it happened – a very rare thing – the teacher found the
captain of the class smoking in the class, and that was a very great
crime. He said to me, “This captain has been taking you to the principal
every day; today you take him.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Perfectly good – although I don’t agree with you. Remember
the school code: no clause says that a student cannot smoke in the
class. So I will take him to the principal, but I will make everything
clear to him. And you should remember that you have been smoking in the
class and we have not reported it simply because it is not in the
code.”</p><p><br></p><p>So I took the captain. The teacher came running behind me, and
halfway there he said, “Don’t mention about me, because I am a new,
temporary appointment; they may throw me out.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Okay, I will not mention you, but you stop smoking in the
class.” He said, “I promise.”</p><p>I took the captain, but the principal was so accustomed to beating me
that he did not ask who has brought whom. He simply said, “Open your
hands,” so I opened my hands and he started beating them.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Do it, but you will repent.” He said, “Why should I
repent?”</p><p>I said, “Today things are different. I have brought this boy; I am
not the criminal today. And you have already hit my hands. Now give me
the cane and open your hands; otherwise I am going to create great
trouble for you. First open your hands and I will hit you exactly the
three times that you have hit me on my hands.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “But...!”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “There is no question of ‘But!’ You did not ask me. You have
not been asking for many days. I have been silent, but this is too
much.” He had to open his hand, and I hit him three times and I told
him, “Remember it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I will remember it my whole life, because being a
principal... a student is hitting me. How can I forget it! But please
don’t spread it all around.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I will not say anything to anybody, but I cannot say
anything about this boy. He will say something; he will have to say
something.”</p><p><br></p><p>The principal asked, “What do you mean, ‘He will have to say
something’?” I said, “I will make him say something. I will not say
anything.”</p><p>“How can you force him to say something?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “First I will protect him. He has been found smoking in the
class; that’s why he has been sent here. But there is no reason... you
open your school code: where is it written that no student can smoke
inside the class? Inside or outside, smoking is not prohibited. It was
not mentioned because nobody ever thought that any student would smoke
in the class.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Yes, that’s true. We will have to make an amendment.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “First you make an amendment, and then we will see; but right
now you cannot punish him. And because I am saving him, he will have to
spread the news.”</p><p><br></p><p>The principal said, “You seem to be strange. Have you come to study
in this school or are you simply creating trouble?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not creating trouble. It is a simple bargain. I have saved him,
and you have been beaten. Now it is his duty to spread it all over the
school. I will keep absolutely silent.” And without my saying, the boy
did it, because he was very happy that I had taken him to be punished
and I protected him instead.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked the principal that day, “You smoke, and almost every teacher
in the school smokes, except one or two; then why this antagonism
against smoking? And if smoking is bad, then you should start stopping
the teachers, because the students will follow the teachers.”</p><p><br></p><p>Parents smoke and don’t allow their children to smoke; they simply
create hypocrites. The children smoke, hiding here and there. This is a
very clumsy society. Nobody knows exactly what they are</p><p>trying to do, or how it can be done. They all say, “Don’t judge” –
but how to avoid being judgmental when on the other hand you are telling
everybody, “This is good, this is bad, this is right, that is
wrong”?</p><p><br></p><p>The whole teaching of your morality is judgmental, and in that very
teaching this is also one part: “Don’t be judgmental.” You are creating
confusion, and the only way the child will be able to survive this
confusion is to become a hypocrite. He will judge and he will say that
he is not judgmental. And he will believe that his judgment is a valid
fact. But the reality is such that there is no valid fact: even science
has only relative facts, no valid facts. It can only be said that
hypothetically it is true. Tomorrow it may change; more research may
change it.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a hundred years ago science was very stubborn about saying that
whatever it said was a solid statement of reality. Now it is not so. The
situation has come to a point where now you cannot write a big book on
modern science, because by the time your book is finished everything
that you have written will be out of date. So today there are only small
periodicals and papers that are immediately printed and distributed and
read in conferences, because you cannot be certain about tomorrow.
Tomorrow somebody will find some other fact and your whole work will
collapse.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything is relative.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind cannot find the ultimate.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind cannot find the solid fact, because that is what truth is. It
can find only approximate fictions which, somehow for the moment, help
you to understand reality and to work with it.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t make it a problem and don’t try to solve it at the level of
the mind. Mind is condemned to be judgmental. So don’t try to do what
cannot be done. What can be done is to slip out of the mind. Slowly
slowly go beyond the mind, and start looking from a witnessing silence.
Perhaps then what you see is the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a Sufi story of Junnaid. One of his disciples said to him,
“I trust in you absolutely.”</p><p><br></p><p>Junnaid said, “Don’t say such a thing because you are still in the
mind, and absolute trust is not a quality of the mind. You have come
here to me to reach the state where you can be in absolute trust, but
right now don’t say that.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the disciple was stubborn. He said, “I trust you. And it is not
something that can be shaken or taken away. I can give my life, but I
will not drop my trust.”</p><p><br></p><p>Junnaid said, “That I can believe. You can give your life, but as far
as trust is concerned we will see later on.”</p><p><br></p><p>A few days afterwards the disciple saw Junnaid sitting with a woman
on the other side of the lake. That was a great shock, because Sufi
mystics are not allowed to be with women. And not only that: the woman
was pouring wine into a cup for Junnaid. Junnaid took the cup and drank
the wine. And Sufis are against any kind of alcoholic beverages!</p><p>It was too much. The disciple went to the other side of the lake and
said to Junnaid, “You have killed my trust.”</p><p><br></p><p>Junnaid said, “I told you before that trust by the mind is not of
much value.”</p><p><br></p><p>The disciple said, “Don’t try to still be a master. You have been
cheating people! You are drinking wine, you are sitting with a woman.”
Of course the woman had a black veil on as Mohammedan women do.</p><p><br></p><p>Junnaid said, “Taste the wine. It is nothing but water, just colored
so it looks like wine.” The disciple tasted it. He was puzzled. He
asked, “But why did you do it?”</p><p>And Junnaid said, “Turn back the veil of the woman – she is my
mother.”</p><p><br></p><p>He turned back the veil; she was Junnaid’s mother. He fell at
Junnaid’s feet and said, “Forgive me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Junnaid said, “There is no need. I simply wanted to make it clear to
you not to say things through the mind which the mind cannot manage:
absolute truth, absolute trust. Now just a woman sitting by my side – if
you had trust, you would not have bothered about it. That is not your
business. You are not my master. You have not become my disciple on the
condition that I will not sit by the side of a woman. You have not made
the condition that you will be my disciple if I don’t drink wine, so why
should you be disturbed?”</p><p><br></p><p>The poor disciple was simply repeating his social conditioning. But
one thing was clear now: to say things which the mind is not capable of
saying is wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>So you need not be bothered about what your father said to you. All
that is past, just dust on the mirror. Clean the mirror and come to a
state where silence prevails. Then whatever you see or say will be a
statement of fact because you don’t have any opinion. But carrying those
opinions along with you and trying to be nonjudgmental is fighting with
yourself unnecessarily. And that fight is blocking your
intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>Any fight splits you into two. Any fight within you is dangerous to
your intelligence. When you are not fighting with anything within you,
when everything is calm and quiet, your intelligence has its total
flavor, sharpness, beauty. And intelligence is our only treasure. It is
through intelligence that we are going to find out everything about the
mysteries of life.</p><p><br></p><p>But don’t create a conflict. And don’t be angry with your father.
What he did must have been done to him. So parents simply go on
transferring diseases from generation to generation; it is an
unconscious process.</p><p><br></p><p>You can jump out of that whole vicious circle just with the simple
alertness that whatever they have taught you they themselves were not
aware of. They meant well, but they created a confusion in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>AS I LOOK TO SEE WHAT MY QUESTION IS I REMEMBER THE SAYING, “WHEN
THERE IS LOVE, EVERYTHING IS BEAUTIFUL. AND WHEN THERE IS NO LOVE, ALL
IS UGLY.” DO ALL MY QUESTIONS AND APPARENT PROBLEMS ARISE AS A RESULT OF
BEING OUT OF TOUCH WITH MY HEART?</p><p><br></p><p>The second part of your question is right. All questions, not only
yours but everybody’s, arise because you are not in touch with the
heart. Mind is a question producing mechanism. It cannot find any
answer, but it can produce millions of questions.</p><p><br></p><p>The heart has the answer.</p><p><br></p><p>The questions may be millions, but the answer is one. So if you are
in touch with your heart, your questions disappear. This is the second
part of your question.</p><p><br></p><p>But the first part is a totally different thing. You say, “When there
is love everything looks beautiful, and when there is no love everything
looks ugly.” That is an hallucination.</p><p><br></p><p>Love creates a kind of hallucination. You are happy, you are joyous,
you are covered with a haze of joy, and you project on everybody the
same joy, the same beauty that you are feeling – but it is a projection,
it is not a reality. And when the love disappears from your heart and
turns sour or becomes hate, the same people start looking ugly. That too
is a projection. Neither the first nor the second has anything to do
with the reality of the people or things around you.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to really know the truth about people, you have to go
beyond all dualisms. Love and hate, day and night, life and death – all
kinds of dualisms have to be dropped. And that is possible only by being
a witness. Then you are a mirror. Then you simply mirror, you don’t
state anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Whether or not a person standing in front of you is beautiful, the
mirror says nothing; it simply reflects the person. If the person is
ugly, the mirror says nothing; it simply reflects the ugly person. The
witnessing consciousness simply reflects. It does not state, but it
understands. What is the point of saying to anybody, “You are ugly”?
What is the point of saying to someone, “You are beautiful”? – because
whatever you say to people, your opinion becomes a disturbance in their
life.</p><p><br></p><p>The witnessing consciousness is a very silent observer. It knows but
it does not say. There is no need. A is A, B is B. What is the point of
saying it? Why create disturbances in other people’s minds?</p><p><br></p><p>Love is not a state of awakening. It is a kind of drug, it is
hormonal.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about one supreme court chief justice in America. When
he retired from the supreme court he had only one wish. Sixty years
earlier he and his wife had got married and had gone to Paris for their
honeymoon. His name was Parry, and he had only one wish: before they die
they should again go to Paris.</p><p><br></p><p>So after retirement the first thing he did was take his old wife to
Paris. They stayed in the same hotel, in the same room. They went to
visit the same places – but something was missing. Finally</p><p>Parry said to his wife, “Paris has changed so much – no longer that
juice that used to be here, no longer that beauty, no longer that
colorfulness. Everything seems to be stale, flat. I was thinking that in
sixty years Paris would have become even juicier. I have not come here
for this disillusionment.”</p><p><br></p><p>His wife said, “If you don’t mind, I would like to say that Paris is
still the same Paris; it is Parry who has changed. We are now old, we
have lost our juice. That was our honeymoon; this is not our honeymoon.
We are half in our graves! Sixty years ago what we saw was not true: it
was a projection of a couple on their honeymoon, in great love. This is
also not true: this is the illusion of an old couple who have nothing in
the future but death and darkness. This is also a projection.” The wife
was certainly right.</p><p><br></p><p>So your love may look as if it is giving beauty to things, and your
hate, ugliness to things – but they are only projections. Don’t depend
on projections. If you want to know the reality, then just be a witness.
And the witness is never young, never old; it is timeless. So there is
no question of youth, old age, honeymoon and graveyard. They don’t come
in its path.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever the witness sees is the case. It is only a mirror.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

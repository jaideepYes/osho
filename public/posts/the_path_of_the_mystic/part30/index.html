IN KATHMANDU, I WAS SO TOUCHED WHEN YOU WERE SPEAKING ABOUT GOING BEYOND THE POLARITY OF LOVE-HATE. I FEEL SO GRATEFUL TOWARDS YOU BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME THAT GIVING LOVE WILL BE MY MEDITATION.\nNo man is an island. This has to be remembered as one of the fundamental truths of life. I am emphasizing it because we tend to forget it. We are all part of one life force, part of one oceanic existence. Basically, because we are one deep down in our roots, the possibility of love arises. If we were not one, there would be no possibility of love.\nYou can like a house, but you cannot love it. You can like any thing, but ‘love’ is not the appropriate word to be used for liking. Love is reserved only for those who are on the same ladder of evolution.\nThe second thing to be remembered is that evolution functions through polarities. Just as you cannot walk on one leg, you need two legs to walk... existence needs polar opposites – man and woman, life and death, love and hate – to create momentum; otherwise, there will be silence.\nThe opposite attracts you on one hand and on the other hand makes you feel dependent. And nobody wants to be dependent; hence there is a constant struggle between lovers: they are trying to dominate each other. The name is love, but the game is politics.\n323\nThe very effort of man is to dominate the woman, to reduce her to an inferior status, not to allow her to grow, so she always remains retarded. For thousands of years, what man has done to woman is simply monstrous: no education – she cannot read the holy scriptures. She cannot think of herself as equal to man. And she has been conditioned so deeply that even if you say she is equal, she is not going to believe it. It has become almost her mind – the conditioning has become her mind, that she is less in everything: physical strength, intellectual qualities... Man has made a society in which he has become the protector and the woman is the protected.\nThe Hindu scriptures say that in childhood the father should protect the girl; in youth the husband should protect the woman; in old age the son should protect the mother. But she is always to be protected, and man is to protect her. He has made her weak, uneducated, uncultured; he has stopped her movement in the society. And the worst thing he has done is, he has taken her liberty, her financial freedom, which cuts her very roots to be free. She has to be dependent; she is not capable of earning for herself.\nFor centuries there was a certain logic in it because the woman had to become a mother. And out of ten children, nine children were dying, so a woman was pregnant for almost the whole period of her life until menopause. How can she work? How can she earn? She is carrying a child, and she is caring for other small children, looking after them, looking after the house. In short, man made women slaves – and very cheaply, without purchasing her. You can see the irony...\nIn India... and I think in other countries also, in different ways, the same thing happens. In India, when a boy has been born he is welcomed with bands, dancing, singing, so the whole town knows that a boy has been born. But when a girl is born there is no celebration. The whole town knows by the silence that a girl has been born.\nWhat is the problem for the parents? To them, a daughter or a son should be the same. But the problem is that the son is going to earn, is going to help them in their old age, is going to have the inheritance of the family. The daughter, on the contrary, is a financial loss. You feed her, you clothe her – and when you marry her you have to give a dowry. Strange – she is becoming a slave, and the parents have to pay: “Please accept my daughter as your slave.” The dowry is the payment. Ordinarily slaves are purchased, and whoever purchases has to pay. In the case of women, the parents of the woman have to pay instead – give the daughter and pay enough money.\nThe woman does not want – nobody wants – to be dependent. Nobody wants to be a slave. Nobody wants to be inferior because nobody is inferior. People are different; the question of superiority and inferiority is simply absurd. So she starts taking revenge unconsciously. She cannot love the man who owns her as property, who does not recognize her as a human being equal to himself.\nOne of the Hindu saints – I don’t call him a saint, but Hindus worship him, read his book more than that of any other saint – is Tulsidas. He condemns woman in such ugly terms. He says if you want to remain in control of a woman, you have to beat her once in a while; any excuse will do. Keep her afraid. She should not be given any equality, any friendship. And this has been called – for centuries – “love.”\nThe woman is boiling – unconsciously of course – and she explodes in small ways. Whatever she can do, she does. She cannot beat the husband because she has been told, “Your husband is your\ngod. You cannot beat him, you have to worship him.” So she beats herself. Having no choice, in anger she beats herself.\nWhen I started criticizing Mahatma Gandhi I said that what he is doing is nothing but the age-old, feminine strategy. You cannot fight with the foreign rulers; you don’t have arms, you don’t have strength, and you don’t have even the desire. All his nonviolence, passive resistance, is nothing but what the woman has always been doing. But nobody has given her the credit of creating a philosophy of nonviolence! She does not beat anyone when she is angry, she tortures herself. And the man who has reduced the woman to such a state also cannot love her.\nLove can exist only in equality, in friendship.\nThe freedom of woman from man’s slavery will also be a freedom for man to experience. So I say the women’s liberation movement is not only women’s liberation, it is also the men’s liberation movement: both will be liberated. The slavery is binding them both, and there is continuous struggle. The woman has found her own strategies to harass the husband, to nag him, to put him down; the man has his strategy. And between these two fighting camps we have been hoping that love is happening. Centuries have passed – love has not happened, or only once in a while.\nThis is the situation of the ordinary love, which is only a name, not a reality.\nIf you ask my vision of love... it is no more a question of dialectics, opposition. Man and woman are different, and complementary. Man alone is half; so is woman. Only together, in a deep feeling of oneness, do they feel for the first time totality, perfection. But to attain to this perfection you have to go beyond the love/hate duality.\nAnd you are capable of going beyond the duality. Right now they go on hand in hand in your life: you love the same person you hate. So in the morning it is hate, in the evening it is love – and it is a very confusing thing. You don’t even understand whether you love the person or you hate the person, because you do both at different times.\nBut this is how the mind functions, it functions through contradictions. Evolution also functions through oppositions – and those oppositions in existence are not contradictions, they are complementaries. But in the mind, contradictions are contradictions. Mind cannot conceive anything that is non-contradictory, that does not have its opposite hiding just behind it.\nAnd we have been told, taught, programmed in such a way that even a thing like love has to be a mind thing. It is basically of the heart, but our whole society has tried to bypass the heart, because the heart is not logical, is not rational. And our minds have been trained through education that anything illogical is wrong, anything irrational is wrong, only a logical thing is right. In our educational programming there is no place for the heart; it is only mind. The heart has almost been removed from our existence, silenced. It has never been given a chance to grow, to have its potential become actual. So mind is dominating everything.\nMind is good where money is concerned; mind is good where war is concerned; mind is good where ambitions are concerned – but mind is absolutely useless where love is concerned. Money, war, desires, ambitions – you cannot put love in the same category.\nLove has a separate source in your being, where there is no contradiction.\nAn authentic education will not teach you only the mind, because mind can give you a good livelihood but not a good life. The heart cannot give you a good livelihood, but it can give you a good life. And there is no reason to choose between the two. Use the mind for what it is made for, and use the heart for what it is made for.\nHeart is the transcendence of duality.\nHeart knows no jealousy – that is a mind product. Heart is so full of love that it can love without any fear of being exhausted. We can fill the whole world with love, but we are almost crippled. The heart has been simply bypassed in our growth; it does not play any role.\nIt is such an ugly system of education... but it is understandable. Religions, politicians, business people, warriors – all have wanted the mind to be trained. And the heart can be a disturbance – it is going to be a disturbance. If you are a soldier and if you have a heart, you cannot kill the enemy, because the moment you take up your gun to kill someone, your heart will say, “Just as you have a wife waiting for you – your children, your old mother and father – this poor man’s wife must be waiting also. His children, his old mother and father, are waiting for him to return home. He has not done anything to you, and you are going to kill him. For what? – to get an award from the military academy? To get a promotion?”\nThe heart will be a disturbance. It is better to make soldiers forget their hearts so they can simply go on killing like robots, without any feelings.\nThe people who are after money don’t want the heart because the heart will be a disturbance: it cannot exploit people.\nMy father was a small businessman... he was a very simple man. And once a customer had dealt with him – my grandfather was there, my uncles were there in the shop, but anybody who had dealt with my father would ask for him. My grandfather would say, “But we are here. What do you want? He has just gone to take his lunch.”\nThey would say, “We will come back. We want to deal only with him.” Because he would tell them what the cost price of any item was. “And this is my profit. If you think the profit is too much, you can tell me. If I can manage to cut it, I will. I have taken the minimum profit; you can go around the market and you can see.”\nThey said, “You are the only person who tells us the cost price. You also tell us your profit, and it is so small that we cannot even tell you to cut it a little. After all, you also have to live. But nobody else does it; even your brothers, your father – nobody talks about the cost price. They simply say, ‘This is the selling price,’ and we don’t know how much profit they are taking.”\nMy whole family was against my father. They said, “This is not the way to do business. This is not a charity shop. You could have made so much more money – but first you tell a person the cost price! And he is not asking the cost price, he is asking the selling price.”\nMy father said, “It is impossible for me to cheat a man, to exploit him. And what are we going to do with the money? Whatever we need, we have. More money brings more troubles.”\nBut nobody was agreeing with him, and if there was a new customer, my grandfather would tell my father, “You go inside. Don’t destroy this customer – let me tackle him.” And my grandfather was asking double the price. If it was worth ten rupees, he was asking twenty rupees, then haggling, and somewhere near fifteen they would agree. Both were happy: he was happy because he was getting five rupees, and the other man was happy because he had brought him down five rupees.\nI used to sit, when I was free, just outside the shop. And when the man was leaving, very happy that he had haggled well, I would say, “You are a fool! This thing that you have purchased costs only ten rupees. If you had purchased it from my father, you would have got it for twelve rupees, because he would not ask more than that. You have lost three rupees, and you are still looking happy.”\nHe would say, “I have been cheated!”\nI would say, “You haggled, you tried in every way. You enjoyed, and you were coming out smiling.” And the man would say, “You have destroyed my whole joy. Who are you?”\nI said, “I am no one, I am just sitting here to tell new customers to ask for my father. Don’t deal with anybody else; otherwise your pocket is going to be cut.”\nMy grandfather would be very angry with me, and say, “Who are you? Are you an agent for your father?”\nI said, “I am nobody’s agent. I simply see what is going on and what should not be going on. You moved my father inside, but you forgot that I was sitting outside.”\nThe heart will mismanage everything that the society wants: exploitation, manipulation, domination, obedience, dependence, sacrifice – the list can be miles long. If the heart is allowed to grow side by side with the mind, the mind cannot manage to do atrocities, murders. But even religious leaders are not ready for the heart. They talk about love, but it is all talk, mere talk. They have destroyed the source from where love arises, and then they talk about love and give sermons about love.\nThere was a small church in my town, but there were not many Christians. I used to go into the church, and the priest was very much surprised because I was the only non-Christian who had ever entered the church. We became friends.\nI said to him, “You talk so much about love, but I see you beating your wife, I see you continually quarreling with your neighbors. I have even seen you hitting a dog who was not doing anything to you. He was going on his own way and he just passed you – I don’t know what came over you that you hit the dog. A strange Christianity!”\nHe said, “You don’t know that dog.”\nI said, “I know that dog because I also live here. He has never hit anybody. And if he bites you that will be perfectly right, because without any cause you have hit him.”\nHe said, “You don’t understand. These vagabond dogs” – and in India you will find them everywhere, they belong to nobody – “if you don’t hit them and you don’t kick them, they take advantage. They will follow you, they will wag their tail, they will persuade you. Before you know it they will come to your house, and naturally one thinks to give them something to eat...”\nThey are almost starving, because in India you cannot kill them. The municipal committee, the corporations, cannot simply give them poison and finish them. If nobody is the owner they should not be left around, but in India you cannot kill anybody. And he was rationalizing his kick.\nI said, “I don’t think your rationalization is right. You really wanted to kick. You were angry with something; the poor dog became unnecessarily the object. He had not done anything.”\nHe said, “How do you know about it?”\nI said, “It is simple. The dog was going on its own way – I was watching. He was not doing anything to you, he had not even looked at you. He was a Hindu dog, and you are a Christian priest – he did not even bark at you. There is no dialogue possible. You hit him, and he is starving. There must be something in you that wanted to hit, it didn’t matter whom. You wanted to be violent.”\nHe said, “Perhaps you are right. I was angry with my boy but I cannot hit him, because if I hit him he disappears from the house for days. Then we are all in trouble. We have to report to the police, and now even the police become angry and say, ‘In the whole city it is only your son who gets lost. It is not a big place, nobody is kidnapping anybody, and for what should your son be kidnapped? – you are a poor priest. You must have been misbehaving with him.’”\nHe said, “It is true. I wanted to hit him because he had broken some statue we had of Jesus Christ.”\nI said, “You should think of your Jesus Christ – I have listened to you – he says, ‘Love your enemies.’ I think he forgot to say, ‘If somebody breaks a statue of me, love him.’ A statue is broken, nothing much – you can’t have a very valuable statue.”\nMan is angry about many things. In life, he is in a struggle. He does not always succeed, everybody cannot succeed – he is angry. He comes and throws his anger over his wife, his children, and these are the people he believes he loves.\nEven religious leaders don’t want your heart to open to reality, because it will bring a great transformation in your actions, in your thoughts, and they don’t want that. They want you to be bound to the tradition, to the old. Whether it is right or wrong does not matter; it has respectability because it is ancient.\nThe heart knows nothing of the past, nothing of the future; it knows only of the present. The heart has no time concept. It sees things clearly, and love is its natural quality – no training is needed. And this love has no hate as a counterpart.\nI was talking about a love that goes beyond love and hate. Love that comes from the mind is always love-hate. It is not two words, it is one word – lovehate – not even a hyphen dividing them. And a love that comes from your heart, which is beyond all dualities...\nEveryone is in search of that love. But he is searching with the mind, and hence he is miserable. Every lover feels failure, deception, betrayal. But nobody is at fault; the reality is that you are using a wrong instrument. It is as if somebody is using eyes to listen to music, and then freaks out that there is no music. But eyes are not meant for listening, nor are ears meant to see.\nMind is a very businesslike, calculating mechanism; it has nothing to do with love. Love will be a chaos, it will disturb everything in it.\nHeart has nothing to do with business – it is always on holiday. It can love, and it can love without ever turning its love into hate; it has no poisons of hate.\nEverybody is searching for it, but just through a wrong instrument; hence the failure in the world. And slowly slowly, seeing that love only brings misery, people become closed: “Love is all nonsense.” They create a thick barrier against love. But they will miss all the joys of life; they will miss all that is valuable.\nJust change the instrument.\nThere is a song in Urdu... there are songs which cannot be played on every instrument. The right instrument is needed for a certain kind of music. Love is a music, and you have the instrument. But because the heart is starving, your life is misery. And you go on making it more miserable because you go on making the same mistake – a wrong instrument and you are trying to play music for which it is not made.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\n“BUDDHAM SHARANAM GACHCHHAMI:” IN INDIA THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR THE “BUDDHAM.”\n“SANGHAM SHARANAM GACHCHHAMI:” IN AMERICA, THE “SANGHAM” WAS DESTROYED.\n“DHAMMAM SHARANAM GACHCHHAMI” ... BELOVED MASTER, WILL YOU FILL IN THE BLANK?\nThe sutra is so important. Buddham sharanam gachchhami was always there, undeclared. It was happening, there was no need to say it.\nTo be with a master, there is no other way except buddham sharanam gachchhami: I go to the feet of the awakened one. Only in such humbleness do you become part of the master’s experience and his life. Sangham sharanam gachchhami was not destroyed in the commune in America. The commune is destroyed, but the sutra cannot be destroyed.\nIf you love the master, you cannot avoid loving all those who love your master. How can you avoid it? You have chosen a master, somebody else has also chosen a master; suddenly you become aware that you are both on the same path, you are connected through the same master, the same energy. The commune can be destroyed, the physical component, but not its spiritual content.\nAnd those who think that in America they have destroyed the commune are just befooling themselves: the commune has spread all over the world. Now we can declare the whole world as our commune. It is out of our generosity that we allow other people also to live there, in the hope that sooner or later they will become part of the commune! They are our sources, because from where are we going to get new sannyasins? Our sannyasins are so understanding that they are not going to create children; they have no time. Sitting silently, doing nothing... children are not born by themselves! Something will have to be done, and our sannyasins are not interested in doing anything. So no children, just grass growing.\nSo we will need new sannyasins. And there are so many people who don’t know the secret of sitting silently, doing nothing, waiting for the spring and enjoying the grass growing. They never sit silently, they are always doing something or other – they will produce children for our sannyasins, so we allow them to remain on the earth. Otherwise, we have covered the whole planet.\nSo nothing is destroyed, and it is impossible for the concept to be destroyed. Even if just you few people are here, it becomes the sangham; it becomes a gathering of fellow travelers. Your love for the same master creates a strange kind of unity. You are not directly related to each other, but you are related through me to each other. Directly, you can sometimes come into conflict, but through me you cannot come into conflict; I will be neutralizing your conflict.\nDhammam sharanam gachchhami – that is the last part of the sutra. That is our search, that is our seeking. Dhammam means truth, ultimate truth. The first two steps are just to help you towards the third.\nThere is a group of Sufis who simply call themselves the Seekers. There is another group of Sufis who simply call themselves the Builders. They have beautiful names; you cannot imagine that they have anything to do with religion. But the Builders are building to reach to the ultimate star; the Seekers are searching... and they have chosen these names so the religious authorities don’t get offended.\nIf you go to the Middle East and you simply tell anybody, “I want to go to some Sufi school,” they will shrug their shoulders because nobody knows what you mean. To enter a Sufi school is difficult, unless by chance you come across a person who is connected and who can take you to the master.\nBut you will be puzzled, because Sufi masters, just to avoid unnecessary persecution, unnecessary harassment, live in a very ordinary way. Somebody is a weaver, somebody is a potter, somebody sells perfumes, somebody does some other thing – and you cannot think that this man is a Sufi master. And in the night, in some friend’s house, you will see the same man sitting with his disciples. And you cannot believe it, because this man, although he is the same, is radiating something that was not there when you had seen him as a perfume seller or a potter or a weaver. The Sufis have methods to prevent people from seeing them as masters, so that their work can continue silently underground.\nThe work is the same, whoever is doing it.\nIt is dhammam sharanam gachchhami – a longing to know the truth, to be the truth. A man is not really a man if this longing is not in his being.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"4368","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_path_of_the_mystic/part30/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_path_of_the_mystic/>The Path of the Mystic</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">30 The name is love, but the game is politics</h1><div class=post-meta>21 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;4368 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Path_of_the_Mystic/part30.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part29>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

IN KATHMANDU,
I WAS SO TOUCHED WHEN YOU WERE SPEAKING ABOUT GOING BEYOND THE POLARITY
OF LOVE-HATE. I FEEL SO GRATEFUL TOWARDS YOU BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME THAT
GIVING LOVE WILL BE MY MEDITATION.</p><p><br></p><p>No man is an island. This has to be remembered as one of the
fundamental truths of life. I am emphasizing it because we tend to
forget it. We are all part of one life force, part of one oceanic
existence. Basically, because we are one deep down in our roots, the
possibility of love arises. If we were not one, there would be no
possibility of love.</p><p><br></p><p>You can like a house, but you cannot love it. You can like any thing,
but ‘love’ is not the appropriate word to be used for liking. Love is
reserved only for those who are on the same ladder of evolution.</p><p><br></p><p>The second thing to be remembered is that evolution functions through
polarities. Just as you cannot walk on one leg, you need two legs to
walk... existence needs polar opposites – man and woman, life and death,
love and hate – to create momentum; otherwise, there will be
silence.</p><p><br></p><p>The opposite attracts you on one hand and on the other hand makes you
feel dependent. And nobody wants to be dependent; hence there is a
constant struggle between lovers: they are trying to dominate each
other. The name is love, but the game is politics.</p><p><br></p><p>323</p><p>The very effort of man is to dominate the woman, to reduce her to an
inferior status, not to allow her to grow, so she always remains
retarded. For thousands of years, what man has done to woman is simply
monstrous: no education – she cannot read the holy scriptures. She
cannot think of herself as equal to man. And she has been conditioned so
deeply that even if you say she is equal, she is not going to believe
it. It has become almost her mind – the conditioning has become her
mind, that she is less in everything: physical strength, intellectual
qualities... Man has made a society in which he has become the protector
and the woman is the protected.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hindu scriptures say that in childhood the father should protect
the girl; in youth the husband should protect the woman; in old age the
son should protect the mother. But she is always to be protected, and
man is to protect her. He has made her weak, uneducated, uncultured; he
has stopped her movement in the society. And the worst thing he has done
is, he has taken her liberty, her financial freedom, which cuts her very
roots to be free. She has to be dependent; she is not capable of earning
for herself.</p><p><br></p><p>For centuries there was a certain logic in it because the woman had
to become a mother. And out of ten children, nine children were dying,
so a woman was pregnant for almost the whole period of her life until
menopause. How can she work? How can she earn? She is carrying a child,
and she is caring for other small children, looking after them, looking
after the house. In short, man made women slaves – and very cheaply,
without purchasing her. You can see the irony...</p><p><br></p><p>In India... and I think in other countries also, in different ways,
the same thing happens. In India, when a boy has been born he is
welcomed with bands, dancing, singing, so the whole town knows that a
boy has been born. But when a girl is born there is no celebration. The
whole town knows by the silence that a girl has been born.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the problem for the parents? To them, a daughter or a son
should be the same. But the problem is that the son is going to earn, is
going to help them in their old age, is going to have the inheritance of
the family. The daughter, on the contrary, is a financial loss. You feed
her, you clothe her – and when you marry her you have to give a dowry.
Strange – she is becoming a slave, and the parents have to pay: “Please
accept my daughter as your slave.” The dowry is the payment. Ordinarily
slaves are purchased, and whoever purchases has to pay. In the case of
women, the parents of the woman have to pay instead – give the daughter
and pay enough money.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman does not want – nobody wants – to be dependent. Nobody
wants to be a slave. Nobody wants to be inferior because nobody is
inferior. People are different; the question of superiority and
inferiority is simply absurd. So she starts taking revenge
unconsciously. She cannot love the man who owns her as property, who
does not recognize her as a human being equal to himself.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the Hindu saints – I don’t call him a saint, but Hindus
worship him, read his book more than that of any other saint – is
Tulsidas. He condemns woman in such ugly terms. He says if you want to
remain in control of a woman, you have to beat her once in a while; any
excuse will do. Keep her afraid. She should not be given any equality,
any friendship. And this has been called – for centuries – “love.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman is boiling – unconsciously of course – and she explodes in
small ways. Whatever she can do, she does. She cannot beat the husband
because she has been told, “Your husband is your</p><p>god. You cannot beat him, you have to worship him.” So she beats
herself. Having no choice, in anger she beats herself.</p><p><br></p><p>When I started criticizing Mahatma Gandhi I said that what he is
doing is nothing but the age-old, feminine strategy. You cannot fight
with the foreign rulers; you don’t have arms, you don’t have strength,
and you don’t have even the desire. All his nonviolence, passive
resistance, is nothing but what the woman has always been doing. But
nobody has given her the credit of creating a philosophy of nonviolence!
She does not beat anyone when she is angry, she tortures herself. And
the man who has reduced the woman to such a state also cannot love
her.</p><p><br></p><p>Love can exist only in equality, in friendship.</p><p><br></p><p>The freedom of woman from man’s slavery will also be a freedom for
man to experience. So I say the women’s liberation movement is not only
women’s liberation, it is also the men’s liberation movement: both will
be liberated. The slavery is binding them both, and there is continuous
struggle. The woman has found her own strategies to harass the husband,
to nag him, to put him down; the man has his strategy. And between these
two fighting camps we have been hoping that love is happening. Centuries
have passed – love has not happened, or only once in a while.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the situation of the ordinary love, which is only a name, not
a reality.</p><p><br></p><p>If you ask my vision of love... it is no more a question of
dialectics, opposition. Man and woman are different, and complementary.
Man alone is half; so is woman. Only together, in a deep feeling of
oneness, do they feel for the first time totality, perfection. But to
attain to this perfection you have to go beyond the love/hate
duality.</p><p><br></p><p>And you are capable of going beyond the duality. Right now they go on
hand in hand in your life: you love the same person you hate. So in the
morning it is hate, in the evening it is love – and it is a very
confusing thing. You don’t even understand whether you love the person
or you hate the person, because you do both at different times.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is how the mind functions, it functions through
contradictions. Evolution also functions through oppositions – and those
oppositions in existence are not contradictions, they are
complementaries. But in the mind, contradictions are contradictions.
Mind cannot conceive anything that is non-contradictory, that does not
have its opposite hiding just behind it.</p><p><br></p><p>And we have been told, taught, programmed in such a way that even a
thing like love has to be a mind thing. It is basically of the heart,
but our whole society has tried to bypass the heart, because the heart
is not logical, is not rational. And our minds have been trained through
education that anything illogical is wrong, anything irrational is
wrong, only a logical thing is right. In our educational programming
there is no place for the heart; it is only mind. The heart has almost
been removed from our existence, silenced. It has never been given a
chance to grow, to have its potential become actual. So mind is
dominating everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is good where money is concerned; mind is good where war is
concerned; mind is good where ambitions are concerned – but mind is
absolutely useless where love is concerned. Money, war, desires,
ambitions – you cannot put love in the same category.</p><p>Love has a separate source in your being, where there is no
contradiction.</p><p><br></p><p>An authentic education will not teach you only the mind, because mind
can give you a good livelihood but not a good life. The heart cannot
give you a good livelihood, but it can give you a good life. And there
is no reason to choose between the two. Use the mind for what it is made
for, and use the heart for what it is made for.</p><p><br></p><p>Heart is the transcendence of duality.</p><p><br></p><p>Heart knows no jealousy – that is a mind product. Heart is so full of
love that it can love without any fear of being exhausted. We can fill
the whole world with love, but we are almost crippled. The heart has
been simply bypassed in our growth; it does not play any role.</p><p><br></p><p>It is such an ugly system of education... but it is understandable.
Religions, politicians, business people, warriors – all have wanted the
mind to be trained. And the heart can be a disturbance – it is going to
be a disturbance. If you are a soldier and if you have a heart, you
cannot kill the enemy, because the moment you take up your gun to kill
someone, your heart will say, “Just as you have a wife waiting for you –
your children, your old mother and father – this poor man’s wife must be
waiting also. His children, his old mother and father, are waiting for
him to return home. He has not done anything to you, and you are going
to kill him. For what? – to get an award from the military academy? To
get a promotion?”</p><p><br></p><p>The heart will be a disturbance. It is better to make soldiers forget
their hearts so they can simply go on killing like robots, without any
feelings.</p><p><br></p><p>The people who are after money don’t want the heart because the heart
will be a disturbance: it cannot exploit people.</p><p><br></p><p>My father was a small businessman... he was a very simple man. And
once a customer had dealt with him – my grandfather was there, my uncles
were there in the shop, but anybody who had dealt with my father would
ask for him. My grandfather would say, “But we are here. What do you
want? He has just gone to take his lunch.”</p><p><br></p><p>They would say, “We will come back. We want to deal only with him.”
Because he would tell them what the cost price of any item was. “And
this is my profit. If you think the profit is too much, you can tell me.
If I can manage to cut it, I will. I have taken the minimum profit; you
can go around the market and you can see.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “You are the only person who tells us the cost price. You
also tell us your profit, and it is so small that we cannot even tell
you to cut it a little. After all, you also have to live. But nobody
else does it; even your brothers, your father – nobody talks about the
cost price. They simply say, ‘This is the selling price,’ and we don’t
know how much profit they are taking.”</p><p><br></p><p>My whole family was against my father. They said, “This is not the
way to do business. This is not a charity shop. You could have made so
much more money – but first you tell a person the cost price! And he is
not asking the cost price, he is asking the selling price.”</p><p>My father said, “It is impossible for me to cheat a man, to exploit
him. And what are we going to do with the money? Whatever we need, we
have. More money brings more troubles.”</p><p><br></p><p>But nobody was agreeing with him, and if there was a new customer, my
grandfather would tell my father, “You go inside. Don’t destroy this
customer – let me tackle him.” And my grandfather was asking double the
price. If it was worth ten rupees, he was asking twenty rupees, then
haggling, and somewhere near fifteen they would agree. Both were happy:
he was happy because he was getting five rupees, and the other man was
happy because he had brought him down five rupees.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to sit, when I was free, just outside the shop. And when the
man was leaving, very happy that he had haggled well, I would say, “You
are a fool! This thing that you have purchased costs only ten rupees. If
you had purchased it from my father, you would have got it for twelve
rupees, because he would not ask more than that. You have lost three
rupees, and you are still looking happy.”</p><p><br></p><p>He would say, “I have been cheated!”</p><p><br></p><p>I would say, “You haggled, you tried in every way. You enjoyed, and
you were coming out smiling.” And the man would say, “You have destroyed
my whole joy. Who are you?”</p><p>I said, “I am no one, I am just sitting here to tell new customers to
ask for my father. Don’t deal with anybody else; otherwise your pocket
is going to be cut.”</p><p><br></p><p>My grandfather would be very angry with me, and say, “Who are you?
Are you an agent for your father?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am nobody’s agent. I simply see what is going on and what
should not be going on. You moved my father inside, but you forgot that
I was sitting outside.”</p><p><br></p><p>The heart will mismanage everything that the society wants:
exploitation, manipulation, domination, obedience, dependence, sacrifice
– the list can be miles long. If the heart is allowed to grow side by
side with the mind, the mind cannot manage to do atrocities, murders.
But even religious leaders are not ready for the heart. They talk about
love, but it is all talk, mere talk. They have destroyed the source from
where love arises, and then they talk about love and give sermons about
love.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a small church in my town, but there were not many
Christians. I used to go into the church, and the priest was very much
surprised because I was the only non-Christian who had ever entered the
church. We became friends.</p><p><br></p><p>I said to him, “You talk so much about love, but I see you beating
your wife, I see you continually quarreling with your neighbors. I have
even seen you hitting a dog who was not doing anything to you. He was
going on his own way and he just passed you – I don’t know what came
over you that you hit the dog. A strange Christianity!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You don’t know that dog.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I know that dog because I also live here. He has never hit
anybody. And if he bites you that will be perfectly right, because
without any cause you have hit him.”</p><p>He said, “You don’t understand. These vagabond dogs” – and in India
you will find them everywhere, they belong to nobody – “if you don’t hit
them and you don’t kick them, they take advantage. They will follow you,
they will wag their tail, they will persuade you. Before you know it
they will come to your house, and naturally one thinks to give them
something to eat...”</p><p><br></p><p>They are almost starving, because in India you cannot kill them. The
municipal committee, the corporations, cannot simply give them poison
and finish them. If nobody is the owner they should not be left around,
but in India you cannot kill anybody. And he was rationalizing his
kick.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I don’t think your rationalization is right. You really
wanted to kick. You were angry with something; the poor dog became
unnecessarily the object. He had not done anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “How do you know about it?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It is simple. The dog was going on its own way – I was
watching. He was not doing anything to you, he had not even looked at
you. He was a Hindu dog, and you are a Christian priest – he did not
even bark at you. There is no dialogue possible. You hit him, and he is
starving. There must be something in you that wanted to hit, it didn’t
matter whom. You wanted to be violent.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Perhaps you are right. I was angry with my boy but I cannot
hit him, because if I hit him he disappears from the house for days.
Then we are all in trouble. We have to report to the police, and now
even the police become angry and say, ‘In the whole city it is only your
son who gets lost. It is not a big place, nobody is kidnapping anybody,
and for what should your son be kidnapped? – you are a poor priest. You
must have been misbehaving with him.’”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “It is true. I wanted to hit him because he had broken some
statue we had of Jesus Christ.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You should think of your Jesus Christ – I have listened to
you – he says, ‘Love your enemies.’ I think he forgot to say, ‘If
somebody breaks a statue of me, love him.’ A statue is broken, nothing
much – you can’t have a very valuable statue.”</p><p><br></p><p>Man is angry about many things. In life, he is in a struggle. He does
not always succeed, everybody cannot succeed – he is angry. He comes and
throws his anger over his wife, his children, and these are the people
he believes he loves.</p><p><br></p><p>Even religious leaders don’t want your heart to open to reality,
because it will bring a great transformation in your actions, in your
thoughts, and they don’t want that. They want you to be bound to the
tradition, to the old. Whether it is right or wrong does not matter; it
has respectability because it is ancient.</p><p><br></p><p>The heart knows nothing of the past, nothing of the future; it knows
only of the present. The heart has no time concept. It sees things
clearly, and love is its natural quality – no training is needed. And
this love has no hate as a counterpart.</p><p><br></p><p>I was talking about a love that goes beyond love and hate. Love that
comes from the mind is always love-hate. It is not two words, it is one
word – lovehate – not even a hyphen dividing them. And a love that comes
from your heart, which is beyond all dualities...</p><p>Everyone is in search of that love. But he is searching with the
mind, and hence he is miserable. Every lover feels failure, deception,
betrayal. But nobody is at fault; the reality is that you are using a
wrong instrument. It is as if somebody is using eyes to listen to music,
and then freaks out that there is no music. But eyes are not meant for
listening, nor are ears meant to see.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is a very businesslike, calculating mechanism; it has nothing to
do with love. Love will be a chaos, it will disturb everything in
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Heart has nothing to do with business – it is always on holiday. It
can love, and it can love without ever turning its love into hate; it
has no poisons of hate.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody is searching for it, but just through a wrong instrument;
hence the failure in the world. And slowly slowly, seeing that love only
brings misery, people become closed: “Love is all nonsense.” They create
a thick barrier against love. But they will miss all the joys of life;
they will miss all that is valuable.</p><p><br></p><p>Just change the instrument.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a song in Urdu... there are songs which cannot be played on
every instrument. The right instrument is needed for a certain kind of
music. Love is a music, and you have the instrument. But because the
heart is starving, your life is misery. And you go on making it more
miserable because you go on making the same mistake – a wrong instrument
and you are trying to play music for which it is not made.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>“BUDDHAM SHARANAM GACHCHHAMI:” IN INDIA THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR THE
“BUDDHAM.”</p><p><br></p><p>“SANGHAM SHARANAM GACHCHHAMI:” IN AMERICA, THE “SANGHAM” WAS
DESTROYED.</p><p><br></p><p>“DHAMMAM SHARANAM GACHCHHAMI” ... BELOVED MASTER, WILL YOU FILL IN
THE BLANK?</p><p><br></p><p>The sutra is so important. Buddham sharanam gachchhami was always
there, undeclared. It was happening, there was no need to say it.</p><p><br></p><p>To be with a master, there is no other way except buddham sharanam
gachchhami: I go to the feet of the awakened one. Only in such
humbleness do you become part of the master’s experience and his life.
Sangham sharanam gachchhami was not destroyed in the commune in America.
The commune is destroyed, but the sutra cannot be destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>If you love the master, you cannot avoid loving all those who love
your master. How can you avoid it? You have chosen a master, somebody
else has also chosen a master; suddenly you become aware that you are
both on the same path, you are connected through the same master, the
same energy. The commune can be destroyed, the physical component, but
not its spiritual content.</p><p>And those who think that in America they have destroyed the commune
are just befooling themselves: the commune has spread all over the
world. Now we can declare the whole world as our commune. It is out of
our generosity that we allow other people also to live there, in the
hope that sooner or later they will become part of the commune! They are
our sources, because from where are we going to get new sannyasins? Our
sannyasins are so understanding that they are not going to create
children; they have no time. Sitting silently, doing nothing... children
are not born by themselves! Something will have to be done, and our
sannyasins are not interested in doing anything. So no children, just
grass growing.</p><p><br></p><p>So we will need new sannyasins. And there are so many people who
don’t know the secret of sitting silently, doing nothing, waiting for
the spring and enjoying the grass growing. They never sit silently, they
are always doing something or other – they will produce children for our
sannyasins, so we allow them to remain on the earth. Otherwise, we have
covered the whole planet.</p><p><br></p><p>So nothing is destroyed, and it is impossible for the concept to be
destroyed. Even if just you few people are here, it becomes the sangham;
it becomes a gathering of fellow travelers. Your love for the same
master creates a strange kind of unity. You are not directly related to
each other, but you are related through me to each other. Directly, you
can sometimes come into conflict, but through me you cannot come into
conflict; I will be neutralizing your conflict.</p><p><br></p><p>Dhammam sharanam gachchhami – that is the last part of the sutra.
That is our search, that is our seeking. Dhammam means truth, ultimate
truth. The first two steps are just to help you towards the third.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a group of Sufis who simply call themselves the Seekers.
There is another group of Sufis who simply call themselves the Builders.
They have beautiful names; you cannot imagine that they have anything to
do with religion. But the Builders are building to reach to the ultimate
star; the Seekers are searching... and they have chosen these names so
the religious authorities don’t get offended.</p><p><br></p><p>If you go to the Middle East and you simply tell anybody, “I want to
go to some Sufi school,” they will shrug their shoulders because nobody
knows what you mean. To enter a Sufi school is difficult, unless by
chance you come across a person who is connected and who can take you to
the master.</p><p><br></p><p>But you will be puzzled, because Sufi masters, just to avoid
unnecessary persecution, unnecessary harassment, live in a very ordinary
way. Somebody is a weaver, somebody is a potter, somebody sells
perfumes, somebody does some other thing – and you cannot think that
this man is a Sufi master. And in the night, in some friend’s house, you
will see the same man sitting with his disciples. And you cannot believe
it, because this man, although he is the same, is radiating something
that was not there when you had seen him as a perfume seller or a potter

ARE SPECIAL TECHNIQUES NEEDED FOR THIS, OR WILL WATCHFULNESS OF THE MIND, THE BODY, AND THE EMOTIONS SIMPLY BRING US THROUGH THESE DIFFERENT LEVELS?\nThe watchfulness of body, mind and heart is more than enough. No other special techniques are needed, although there are techniques. But as I see them, they are not necessary; on the contrary, they complicate the whole phenomenon. And spiritual growth is not a technological phenomenon, so any technique can become a hindrance. You can start clinging to the technique. That has happened to millions of people.\nSearching for spiritual growth they come across a teacher who gives them a technique. The technique helps them to become more silent, more calm, more quiet, to have a great well-being, but then the technique becomes absolutely essential. They cannot leave the technique. If they leave the technique, all those experiences start disappearing. Even if the technique has been practiced for years, just within three days all the experiences will disappear. The techniques don’t really give you spiritual growth, but they create an hallucination which looks spiritual because you don’t know what spiritual growth is.\nIt happened that one Sufi master was brought to me. He was master of thousands of Mohammedans, and once a year he used to come to the city. A few of the Mohammedans of his group had become interested in me and they wanted a meeting. They highly appreciated that their master sees God everywhere, in everything, and he is always joyful: “We have been with him for twenty years and we have never seen him in any other state except ecstasy.”\nI told them, “It will be good that he becomes a guest in my house. For three days you leave him with me. I will take care of your master.” He was an old man, a very good man.\nI asked him, “Have you used any technique for this constant ecstasy, or has it come on its own without any technique?”\nHe said, “I have certainly used a technique. The technique is to remember, looking at everything, that there is God in it. In the beginning it looked ridiculous, but slowly slowly the mind became accustomed: now I see God everywhere in everything.”\nThen I said, “You do one thing... How long have you been practicing it?” “Forty years” – he must have been nearabout seventy.\nI asked, “Can you trust your experience of ecstasy?” He said, “Absolutely.”\nThen I said, “Do one thing: for three days you stop the technique... no more remembering that God is in everything. For three days look at things as they are; don’t impose your idea of God. A table is a table, a chair is a chair, a tree is a tree, a man is a man.”\nHe asked, “But what is the purpose of it?” I said, “I will tell you after three days.”\nBut not even three days were needed; after only one day he was angry at me, ferociously angry that, “You have destroyed my forty years’ discipline. You are a dangerous man. I have been told that you are a master, and rather than helping me... Now I see in a chair nothing but a chair, in a man nothing but a man; God has disappeared, and with the disappearance of God my ecstasy that I am surrounded by an ocean of God has also disappeared.”\nI said, “This was the specific purpose. I wanted you to understand that your technique has produced an hallucination; otherwise forty years’ discipline cannot disappear in one day. You had to continue the technique, so it would continue to create the illusion. Now it is up to you: if you want to live your remaining life in an hallucinatory ecstasy, it is up to you. But if you want to wake up, then no technique is needed.”\nAnd remember, witnessing is not a technique, it is your nature. Watching is not a technique, because you are not imposing anything, so there is no possibility of creating an illusion; you are simply watching. Even if God comes in front of you, you are not supposed to fall on the ground and touch his feet: you have simply to watch. Watching is not a technique.\nA technique creates something; watching simply reveals that which is. It does not create anything; on the contrary, it may destroy a few illusions that were hanging around because you were not watchful enough, so you had never noticed that they were illusory phenomena.\nAn illusion can be created so easily that mind always enjoys techniques. Who is going to use the technique? The mind will be the master of the technique.\nWatchfulness is beyond mind. Mind cannot watch. That is the only thing in existence that mind cannot do. That’s why mind cannot pollute it, mind cannot lead it astray.\nI used to live with one of my father’s sisters for a few years. One of her friends used to visit her once in a while; they were very close. I used to read late till three o’clock in the night and then I would go to sleep. And that woman, the friend of my father’s sister, had a problem with sleep: she could not sleep. So when the whole house went to sleep, she would come and sit in my study room and talk to me or just sit there. At least I was going to be awake till three o’clock, and that was the time when she also felt sleepy; in the morning she would fall asleep.\nMy father’s sister’s husband had a habit of grinding his teeth in the night two or three times. Something was wrong with his stomach but he ground his teeth and the noise was very clear.\nOne day I was talking to this woman, and she asked, “Do you believe in ghosts?” I said, “Why do you ask that?”\nShe said, “I live alone.” She was a widow, and she was very rich. “I live alone and I always think about my being alone. If ghosts exist I am in danger; there is nobody else in my room.”\nI said, “Ghosts not only exist, they are present in this room, in this house.” She said, “What do you mean?”\nI said, “I will tell you. When this house was made, a washerman lived here with his very beautiful wife who had only one eye. Her face was very beautiful – the only trouble was that she had only one eye. The washerman was recruited into the army during the first world war, and he died there. The shock was so much to the washerwoman that she did not believe it. She refused to believe that he was dead; she waited for him day in, day out. And in this condition, continuously waiting for him, she was not eating well, she was not taking care of her body. Everybody tried to convince her: ‘He is dead, he cannot come. You need not sit at the door the whole day.’\n“But she was absolutely incapable of thinking that he could leave her. There was a bond between them that they would live together and they would die together. They loved each other so much. Finally she died, but because of her desire for the husband to come in search of her, she became a ghost. And she still lives here.\n“After she died, her small hut was removed and this building was made, but she still lives here and she still waits. Every night she comes, and when she comes... you have to understand a signal: she makes a noise as if somebody is grinding his teeth. Why she does that, I don’t know – nobody\nknows – but two or three times she comes in the night. And particularly when somebody is a guest in the house, she is absolutely certain to come – thinking, hoping, that perhaps her husband has come back because a guest is in the house.\n“She comes and she takes the blanket off and looks at your face. She is a very beautiful young woman, but she has only one eye.”\nShe said, “Nobody told me about it.”\nI said, “Then don’t tell anybody; otherwise nobody will stay in this house, and even to sell this house will become impossible. They want to sell this house and they are keeping quiet about the reality. Once it is sold they can purchase another house, and then it is somebody else’s problem; it is not their problem. So they are completely silent about it. But I told you because you asked me, and I have nothing, no investment in this house or anything. I simply say whatever is the case – and this is the case.\n“Just if she comes to your bed and uncovers your face, don’t be afraid because she is a very innocent woman; she has never harmed anyone. She just looks at your face, and finding that it is not her husband, she throws the blanket on your face and goes away. And before she comes you will hear the grinding of the teeth.”\nShe said, “My God! This is a dangerous house – and I have stayed so many times. Perhaps I was asleep when she came. But now I cannot sleep.”\nI said, “You try; you go and sleep.” Nearabout one she went into the room inside, and the moment she went there and put her light off, a great coincidence: she heard the teeth grinding and she shrieked. I rushed in.\nEverybody woke up: “What has happened?” She was flat on the ground; she could not even reach the bed! She was flat on the ground, unconscious.\nAnd they told me, “We have been telling you not to create stories which have no foundation at all. Now it is your duty, your responsibility to take care of her. First bring her to consciousness.”\nI said, “I will try, but I don’t think that she is going to come to consciousness so easily; it is going to take time. And even if she comes, she will go back again.”\nThey said, “But what have you done to her?”\nI said, “Tomorrow morning I will tell you the whole story when she is okay.” I tried. I threw cold water in her eyes.\nShe came to consciousness and just pointed in the corner: “She is standing there!” And again she gave another shriek and went unconscious.\nThe family asked, “Who is standing in that corner?”\nI said, “I don’t know. Somebody must be standing there. I have heard there is a ghost.”\nThey said, “We never heard any ghost. You have been here only two months and you have heard that there is a ghost? Who has told you?”\nI said, “Tomorrow morning... First thing is to bring this woman to consciousness and put her to sleep.” But three or four times it happened: she would come to consciousness, just look in the corner and point, “She is standing there... one eye!” The whole night they all had to remain awake – only I slept.\nIn the morning, the woman told them what story I had told her. They said, “Don’t listen to him. He goes on telling things to people, and it is strange that people believe – even older people.”\nOne man used to live next door to me, and he was a constant visitor. He was very respected – he was sixty-five, older than anybody else in the house – and he was a very loving man. He had the best shop in the city for food. You could not get any better food anywhere; he had the best quality. He was alone – no wife, no children – and he conceived his profession as a service to thousands of people. So it was not only his profession, it was something like a religious duty: everything had to be the best and for the very minimum profit.\nI had told him about this woman. He said, “I don’t believe in ghosts; I am a believer in God. I don’t believe in ghosts at all.”\nI said, “It is not a question of belief, it is a reality. Just one day you can come and sleep in this room.” He said, “Why should I come and sleep in this room?”\nI said, “That shows that certainly you are afraid; just one night... You sleep just in the house next door. You are alone so there is no problem; you can sleep here. I will give you the evidence.”\nHe said, “But why should I try it?”\nI said, “You said that you don’t believe in ghosts, and I said they exist and there is a woman who comes, but she comes only when there is a new guest, so if you are willing you can do it.”\nAnd the same thing happened to that man. He went to bed but he could not sleep because he was waiting for the woman to come – and then came the grinding of teeth. That was certain; it was guaranteed that at least three times in the night he was going to grind his teeth.\nAnd as he ground his teeth, the man simply threw off his blanket and rushed into my room, woke me up, and said, “She has come!”\nI said, “Who?”\nHe said, “The woman you were talking about. I believe in ghosts; just this is enough. But no more than this! I have heard the sound, and I don’t want to get into all that trouble that that other woman had” – because the story had spread all over the city that that woman... She stopped coming to the house because she became so afraid. She had a constant fever for three or four days; even after she became conscious and went to her home she had a fever, the fear went so deep.\nAnd the old man said, “I don’t want to get into that trouble. Just open the door and let me go to my home!”\nI said, “You are such a God-believing person. This is the time to test your God.”\nHe said, “I am not going to listen to you; you are a dangerous fellow. God? I don’t know whether he exists or not, but the ghost certainly exists! I have heard just now... she is grinding her teeth!” And he was an old man and a very religious person, every day going to the temple and chanting mantras and all that.\nHe said, “I can say... but you just open the door and let me go to my home! I will never say again that God exists; I will always say the ghost exists. But let me go! I have enough evidence. More than that... I am an old man. Something may happen to my heart or...”\nThe whole family gathered: “What is happening?”\nI said, “Nothing, but he has heard that ghost again, and I have been telling him, ‘You are such a God-loving person: a ghost cannot do anything to you.’”\nMy family said, “You are... why do you talk about these things?”\nI said, “I don’t talk... he himself started it. And it became a question of God versus ghost. So I said I don’t know that God exists but I know that the ghost exists.”\nAnd the whole family knew that it was my own fiction but they all started believing in it. They said, “Perhaps there is something in it. Once was okay... that woman was influenced because she was listening to him alone deep in the night. But this old man is a religious man and he is respected, and he is behaving like a child!”\nNobody would sleep in that room where these things had happened – not even the people who were living in the house. Nobody was ready to; they would say, “If you want to, you can sleep there.”\nAnd I said, “But I have my room and that room is not better than my room so I don’t want to change.” But in the night if they wanted something from that room – it became just a place to collect things because nobody was ready to live there – they would tell me, “You go first, then we will follow.”\nI said, “You don’t understand: even if the ghost is there she is not afraid of me.”\nThey said, “We don’t want to listen to anything. If we see you going there then we are certain that there is no danger, but first you have to go in; take the torch and enter.” When they wanted something from the room in the middle of the night, or even in the day, they could not go by themselves. Nobody was ready. Even children would run through that room, they would not walk. That room became so famous that when they wanted to sell the house, nobody was ready to purchase it, and they said, “Now you find a purchaser. You have destroyed this house’s value. It is a beautiful house and people call it a ghost house.”\nAnd I said, “You know that there is no ghost.”\nThey said, “We know, but knowing is not enough in these matters; the feeling is the point. The fear of two persons... neither of them has come back again to the house. We call the old man sometimes to come but he says, ‘Never again in that house! I remember that night when he would not open the door – because the key was with him – and I am feeling so guilty that I had to confess, out of my fear, that God does not exist and ghosts exist. Now I am doing prayer twice – morning and evening – convincing God that I believe in him: You exist. These ghosts etcetera don’t exist.’”\nMind can project any experience. That woman really saw the washerwoman as I had described. In the morning she described her exactly: a beautiful woman with long hair and one eye, wearing a red sari with a black border. She said, “If I was a painter I could paint her exactly. I can close my eyes and still see her.”\nThe techniques used for spiritual growth are not different. The Sufi master could not stay with me for three days, but leaving me he finally said to me, “I am grateful. I will have to start my journey again. I can see what has happened: first I just started projecting. I knew that a table is a table, a chair is a chair, but I started projecting that it is God, that it is luminous with God’s existence. And I knew that it is just my idea. But forty years! Slowly slowly it became the reality. But you have shown me that that technique was simply creating an hallucination.”\nThere have been many people – many so-called great saints, prophets, messiahs – who have lived in hallucination, who never knew about the simple natural process of watchfulness.\nIt is better that you don’t get involved with any technique. Watchfulness is so pure; don’t pollute it with anything else. And it is so entire, so complete, that it needs no other support. But mind always wants some technique, because mind can control the technique. Mind is a technician; technology is its field. But watchfulness is beyond its control. It is beyond it, it is above it, and in fact it is the death of the mind.\nIf watchfulness grows in you, mind will die.\nAnd all these people, like Maharishi Mahesh Yogi teaching transcendental meditation, are giving techniques which mind feels perfectly good with. The mind can use it. But there is not going to be any growth. The technique is not bad, but it simply gives you an illusory feeling of well-being – as if you are evolving... and you are standing where you have been; there is no evolution, no growth. All these people are exploiting humanity by giving techniques – and this is the worst exploitation because it stops evolution.\nI am against all techniques.\nI am for a simple, natural process, which you already have, which once in a while you use.\nWhen you are angry, how do you become aware that you are angry? If there was only anger and nobody watching it, you could not become aware of the anger. Anger itself cannot become aware.\nSo you are aware when you are angry, when you are not angry, when you are feeling good, when you are not feeling good. But you have not used this watchfulness consistently, scientifically, deeply, totally in every phase of the mind. And to me this word contains the very essence of meditation.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nIN DISCOURSE THE OTHER NIGHT YOU SAID THAT AT ONE’S DEATH THERE IS BUT A TWO OR THREE SECOND GAP BETWEEN WHICH THE SOUL TRAVELS FROM ONE BODY TO THE NEXT. MASTER, YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOUR LAST LIFE WAS SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS AGO. WHERE WERE YOU FOR ALL THOSE YEARS?\nJust here, in Uruguay! Where else could I be? The whole existence is available. When you are not in a body, you are just part of the whole existence without any partition.\nThe reason why I had to remain seven hundred years... A few people don’t get into the next life immediately. Either the person is so wicked, so animalistic, so murderous, like Adolf Hitler... He is not yet reborn because he needs a certain kind of womb which may not be available for thousands of years: he has to wait. Or if you have attained a certain evolved consciousness there is the same problem: you need a certain womb. Unless that is available, you cannot get another birth.\nOrdinarily it is two or three seconds, because for the sleeping humanity the same kind of wombs are available. All day long millions of people are making love, and they are giving opportunities for new people to enter into a womb. So for the masses there is no problem; they don’t have to wait. It is almost instantaneous: as they leave one body, immediately some womb somewhere is ready. And they get into the closest womb.\nBy the way, if you are born in Germany, then for many lives you may be born in Germany for the simple reason that if you remain just part of the mass there is no reason to go far away to China or Japan and be born there. Just around you there are wombs ready to receive you.\nIn my experiments I have seen that people ordinarily continue in the same environment unless something starts growing in them and they cannot find the right womb in close proximity. Then they change. Then they move to different countries, to different races, to different peoples.\nBut in these extremes – either you are too cursed or too blessed – you will have to wait, because only once in a while a womb is ready for such a person. The father has to have certain qualities, the mother needs to have certain qualities, and only if their qualities are symmetrical with his own qualities can a certain soul enter. So it is not only that you carry your parents’ blood and your parents’ bones and your parents’ cells; there is something even deeper than that. You have certain qualities which are exactly those of your parents, but you have not acquired them from your parents – you had them, that’s why you got those parents.\nUnembodied, you are just part of existence. It is difficult to explain to you where you are because “where” indicates a certain space; “when” indicates a certain time. But as you leave the body, you go beyond time and space both, so there is no way to say where you are. You are: time has stopped for you, space has disappeared for you.\nYou will remain in this state blissfully – if it is bliss that is preventing you from finding a new womb – or very miserably, if you are stuck because of misery, because of anguish, because of all the evil that you have done.\nAdolf Hitler killed millions of people, at least six million people, and then he committed suicide himself – and all for no purpose. The whole thing was absolutely useless. Now to find parents of similar qualities, similar criminal minds, he will have to wait. But all this waiting will be an intense suffering.\nMy own understanding is that because of these situations, the idea of heaven and hell has arisen. There is no hell and there is no heaven, just people who get stuck and cannot find a womb. If they are in anguish, misery, darkness, all the torture they have done to other people starts having its effects on them. They live in utter self-torture. And this is why the idea of hell has been created; otherwise there is no hell. But it has a meaning, a symbolic meaning.\nThose seven hundred years were absolutely blissful for me, and I can say that anybody who has experienced that kind of bliss beyond time and space will naturally think he is in paradise. But there is no paradise; this existence is all. Either you are in the body... then you have a chance to evolve; without the body you cannot evolve. The body is a kind of school. It gives you all the situations for evolution. I know my seven hundred years were blissful, but I could not move ahead; it was frozen bliss. In that state there is no possibility to grow: you will remain at the same point until you are born again, and then you can start growing. A body is needed to grow.\nOnce you have attained the whole possibility of growth, the whole spectrum, there is no need for any evolution; you have come to the full point. Then you will not be coming back into the body. There is no need to come back to the school; you have learned everything. Now you can remain part of existence for eternity, with eternal bliss.\nThe body has to be respected, loved, because it is your vehicle for growth, for moving ahead. Without it you cannot move. That’s why I am continuously surprised that the religions have created the idea that the body is something anti-spiritual. The body is what you want it to be: it can be anti-spiritual, it can be for spirituality. It is a vehicle: wherever you want to go it can take you; in itself it has no program. The body is very innocent and without any program.\nThe fact that all the religions have condemned the body has harmed humanity, because those who have condemned the body have stopped using the possibility of the body to take you to higher states. On the contrary, they have started harming the body. They have been destructive to the body, and that is not going to help. They are destroying their own vehicle.\nBut it seems that the fact that people who have attained enlightenment have not entered into the body again has given a false idea to the priests, to the scholars – to those who don’t know and yet think they know. The idea has come to them that since you don’t enter into the body again after you become enlightened, that means that the body is not spiritual; it is anti-spiritual. You are in the body only because you are not enlightened, so fight with the body, torture the body, make yourself free of the body. But the methods they are using will not make them free of the body; they will get more entangled with the body. But nobody cares to look into all the implications of anything.\nIt is true that the enlightened person never enters the body, but the opposite is not true – that if you don’t enter the body you will be enlightened, or if you destroy the body you will be enlightened. The very idea of destructiveness, torture, is unspiritual, and the person who can destroy himself can easily destroy anybody. If he can torture himself it is very easy for him to torture anybody.\nPerhaps people like Adolf Hitler were your so-called saints in the past. They have tortured their bodies so much that now this is a reaction; the pendulum has moved to the other extreme: now they are torturing other people. Otherwise there is no reason why people should torture other people. What enjoyment can they get in torturing other people? There must be some reason behind it – they have tortured themselves enough. So now it becomes a vicious circle: you torture yourself, then you are born in a body and you torture others; and because you torture others, you are born again in a body and you torture yourself.\nThe Hindustani word for the world is samsara. India has been very careful about its language: each word has its own philosophical background. Samsara means the wheel which goes on moving. The only way to jump out of the wheel is to be watchful, because watchfulness is already outside the wheel. If you become accustomed to watchfulness, you are suddenly out of the wheel. But if you get identified with anger, with jealousy, with love, with hate – with any kind of thing – then you are caught up with the wheel.\nAnd the wheel goes on moving from one extreme to another. What is down will be up, what is up will be down – and there is no end to it unless somebody simply jumps out. And the only way to jump out is to become aware of your anger, of your love, of your hate, of your misery, of your joy. Just being watchful you are already out of the wheel – the goose is out.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHE DARKNESS SEEMS SO DEEP, MY EYES COVERED IN A HAZE, MY MIND NEVER- ENDING NOISE – EXCEPT FOR THOSE MOMENTS I AM WITH YOU – SWIRLING AROUND AND AROUND. THE LIGHT IS THERE BUT SEEMS SO FAR AWAY IN ALL THIS DARKNESS. SOMETIMES I WONDER IF I AM GOING TO MAKE IT. BELOVED MASTER, I CANNOT FIND THE DOOR.\nDon’t be worried. You don’t need to find the door, because you are outside the door! You are never inside, you only believe you are inside. Existentially, you are always outside. The moment you understand that you are out – it was just an idea that you were in – the faraway light is no longer far away; it is you. And the darkness that surrounds you is not found anymore.\nBut the basic thing is to realize that you are already outside the door. There is no way for you to be inside the door. That’s what I was saying: watchfulness is not part of the mind and cannot be part of the mind.\nMind cannot be a witness. Mind is the darkness.\nMind is the whole problem, and the solution is just outside the door waiting for you to recognize that you are not in, you are out.\nWitnessing the content of your mind, the moment comes when you suddenly become aware of your being always out – even in the darkest nights that have passed you were not in. Such a great joy\ndescends over you that it is existentially impossible for you to get in. It is good that you are not finding the door; otherwise you will get in!\nThere is no door. Mind remains in; you remain out. Neither the mind can come out nor you can come in. But the attachment with the mind is possible without any door. The identification with the mind is possible without any door.\nYou have just forgotten yourself.\nNothing is lost, nothing is missing, nothing has to be found. Just remember. A simple remembering – the simplest things are very difficult, that’s true – and this is the most simple thing.\nNone of the problems are yours. As far as you are concerned, no problem can enter in you, but you can get identified with something which is not you.\nI remember a story. A man’s house caught fire. The house was on fire, and it had taken the man’s whole life’s effort to make that beautiful place. Thousands of people had gathered, but there was nothing that could be done. The fire had become so big. And you can understand that man: tears were coming from his eyes. It was his whole life burning in front of him. And then suddenly his son came running and he said, “Dad, why are you worried? We sold the house yesterday. You were out... but we have sold the house. It is now for somebody else to cry and weep, not for you. And we have got enough profit out of it.”\nThe man immediately wiped away his tears and became just a spectator like the others were spectators. The identity, the invisible identity, “It is my house,” was no longer there. There was no pain, there was no misery, there was no problem at all. And he was really happy in a way: “Now we can make a better house.” He was feeling relieved; the house was burning, and he was feeling relieved.\nAnd then a second son came running. He said, “It is true that we had negotiated the sale, but the papers were not signed and the money has not been transferred. So it is our house that is burning, and you are looking at it as if you are just a spectator!” Again those tears were flowing and again the heart was breaking. And nothing has visibly changed: the house is burning, the man is standing there. But these people who are bringing messages are changing everything! When he becomes identified, he is burning with the house. When he gets unidentified, he is relieved and he has nothing to do with the house; it is somebody else’s house.\nThe only thing to be remembered is that you are already out, and by nature there is no way for you to be in. You can believe, you can imagine... still you will be outside. Sitting on the steps of your house you are trying to find the door to go out. You will never find it, it is not there; the whole sky is available. You just stand up and walk in any direction; there is no need of opening any door.\nBut your attachment, your identification, is with the mind, which is in and which cannot come out. It cannot exist in the light. Now this is the situation: witnessing is always out and cannot enter in; it can exist only in the light, it cannot exist in darkness. Mind is always in; it can exist only in darkness, it cannot exist in light.\nBetween these two absolutely different things you are having an identification, an attachment, that is creating the trouble for you.\nSo just remember: you are outside. If you cannot do it suddenly, do it slowly, part by part. When anger is there, watch it, and you will find anger is in and you are out.\nWhen Gurdjieff’s father died Gurdjieff was only nine years old. The father was poor. He called Gurdjieff close to him and told him, “I have nothing to give you as your inheritance. I am poor, and my father was also poor, but he gave me one thing that made me the richest man in the world, although the outside poverty remained. I can only transfer the same to you.\n“It is some advice. Perhaps you are too young and you may not be able to do it right now, but remember it. When you are able to act according to the advice, act according to it. The advice is simple. I will repeat it, and because I am dying, listen carefully and repeat in front of me what I have said so I can die satisfied that I have transferred the message that may have come down from father to son for centuries.”\nThe message was simple. The father said, “If somebody insults you, irritates you, annoys you, just tell him, ‘I have received your message, but I have promised my father that I will answer only after twenty-four hours. I know you are angry, I have understood it. I will come after twenty-four hours and answer you.’ And the same with anything. Give a gap of twenty-four hours.”\nThe nine-year-old boy repeated what the father said, and the father died, but because it was such a moment the message became engraved. As he repeated the message, the father said, “Good. My blessings will be with you, and now I can die peacefully.” He closed his eyes and died. And Gurdjieff, even though he was nine, started practicing what was given to him. Somebody would insult him, and he would say, “I will come after twenty-four hours to answer you because that’s what I have promised my dying father. Right now I cannot answer you.”\nSomebody might beat him, and he would say, “You can beat me right now, but I cannot answer. After twenty-four hours I will come and answer you, because I have promised my dying father.” And later on he used to say to his disciples, “That simple message transformed me totally. The person was beating me but I was not going to react at that moment so there was no question except to watch. There was nothing I had to do: now the person was beating me, I just had to be a spectator. For twenty-four hours there was nothing to do.\n“And watching the man created a new kind of crystallization in me. After twenty-four hours I could see more clearly. At the moment when he was beating me it was impossible to see clearly. My eyes were full of anger. If I was going to answer at that moment I would have wrestled with the man, I would have hit the man, and everything would have been an unconscious reaction.\n“But after twenty-four hours I could think about it more calmly, more quietly. Either he was right – I had done something wrong and I needed, deserved, to be beaten, to be insulted – or he was absolutely wrong. If he was right, there was nothing to say to him except to go and give him thanks. If he was absolutely wrong... then there was no point at all in fighting with a man who is utterly stupid and goes on doing such wrong things. It is meaningless, it is wasting time. He does not deserve any answer.”\nSo after twenty-four hours everything settled down and a clarity was there. And with that clarity and the watchfulness of the moment, Gurdjieff changed into one of the most unique beings of this age. And this was the basic foundation of the whole crystallization of his being.\nYou are always outside. Just watch.\nThe mind is always inside. Don’t be identified with it. Unidentified, you will become more and more clear, and the mind will die on its own accord.\nThe death of the mind and the birth of watchfulness is the beginning of your evolution. And the light will not be far away – it is the light. The darkness will be gone, because when you are light, darkness cannot be around you. That’s why I said that watchfulness is not a technique, it is your nature. Just remember it.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6693","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_path_of_the_mystic/part12/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_path_of_the_mystic/>The Path of the Mystic</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">12 Mind is the whole problem</h1><div class=post-meta>32 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6693 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Path_of_the_Mystic/part12.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part11>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND BRINGING LIGHT TO THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTERPARTS IN
THE UNCONSCIOUS. ARE SPECIAL TECHNIQUES NEEDED FOR THIS, OR WILL
WATCHFULNESS OF THE MIND, THE BODY, AND THE EMOTIONS SIMPLY BRING US
THROUGH THESE DIFFERENT LEVELS?</p><p><br></p><p>The watchfulness of body, mind and heart is more than enough. No
other special techniques are needed, although there are techniques. But
as I see them, they are not necessary; on the contrary, they complicate
the whole phenomenon. And spiritual growth is not a technological
phenomenon, so any technique can become a hindrance. You can start
clinging to the technique. That has happened to millions of people.</p><p><br></p><p>Searching for spiritual growth they come across a teacher who gives
them a technique. The technique helps them to become more silent, more
calm, more quiet, to have a great well-being, but then the technique
becomes absolutely essential. They cannot leave the technique. If they
leave the technique, all those experiences start disappearing. Even if
the technique has been practiced for years, just within three days all
the experiences will disappear. The techniques don’t really give you
spiritual growth, but they create an hallucination which looks spiritual
because you don’t know what spiritual growth is.</p><p>It happened that one Sufi master was brought to me. He was master of
thousands of Mohammedans, and once a year he used to come to the city. A
few of the Mohammedans of his group had become interested in me and they
wanted a meeting. They highly appreciated that their master sees God
everywhere, in everything, and he is always joyful: “We have been with
him for twenty years and we have never seen him in any other state
except ecstasy.”</p><p><br></p><p>I told them, “It will be good that he becomes a guest in my house.
For three days you leave him with me. I will take care of your master.”
He was an old man, a very good man.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked him, “Have you used any technique for this constant ecstasy,
or has it come on its own without any technique?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I have certainly used a technique. The technique is to
remember, looking at everything, that there is God in it. In the
beginning it looked ridiculous, but slowly slowly the mind became
accustomed: now I see God everywhere in everything.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then I said, “You do one thing... How long have you been practicing
it?” “Forty years” – he must have been nearabout seventy.</p><p>I asked, “Can you trust your experience of ecstasy?” He said,
“Absolutely.”</p><p>Then I said, “Do one thing: for three days you stop the technique...
no more remembering that God is in everything. For three days look at
things as they are; don’t impose your idea of God. A table is a table, a
chair is a chair, a tree is a tree, a man is a man.”</p><p><br></p><p>He asked, “But what is the purpose of it?” I said, “I will tell you
after three days.”</p><p>But not even three days were needed; after only one day he was angry
at me, ferociously angry that, “You have destroyed my forty years’
discipline. You are a dangerous man. I have been told that you are a
master, and rather than helping me... Now I see in a chair nothing but a
chair, in a man nothing but a man; God has disappeared, and with the
disappearance of God my ecstasy that I am surrounded by an ocean of God
has also disappeared.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “This was the specific purpose. I wanted you to understand
that your technique has produced an hallucination; otherwise forty
years’ discipline cannot disappear in one day. You had to continue the
technique, so it would continue to create the illusion. Now it is up to
you: if you want to live your remaining life in an hallucinatory
ecstasy, it is up to you. But if you want to wake up, then no technique
is needed.”</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, witnessing is not a technique, it is your nature.
Watching is not a technique, because you are not imposing anything, so
there is no possibility of creating an illusion; you are simply
watching. Even if God comes in front of you, you are not supposed to
fall on the ground and touch his feet: you have simply to watch.
Watching is not a technique.</p><p>A technique creates something; watching simply reveals that which is.
It does not create anything; on the contrary, it may destroy a few
illusions that were hanging around because you were not watchful enough,
so you had never noticed that they were illusory phenomena.</p><p><br></p><p>An illusion can be created so easily that mind always enjoys
techniques. Who is going to use the technique? The mind will be the
master of the technique.</p><p><br></p><p>Watchfulness is beyond mind. Mind cannot watch. That is the only
thing in existence that mind cannot do. That’s why mind cannot pollute
it, mind cannot lead it astray.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to live with one of my father’s sisters for a few years. One
of her friends used to visit her once in a while; they were very close.
I used to read late till three o’clock in the night and then I would go
to sleep. And that woman, the friend of my father’s sister, had a
problem with sleep: she could not sleep. So when the whole house went to
sleep, she would come and sit in my study room and talk to me or just
sit there. At least I was going to be awake till three o’clock, and that
was the time when she also felt sleepy; in the morning she would fall
asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>My father’s sister’s husband had a habit of grinding his teeth in the
night two or three times. Something was wrong with his stomach but he
ground his teeth and the noise was very clear.</p><p><br></p><p>One day I was talking to this woman, and she asked, “Do you believe
in ghosts?” I said, “Why do you ask that?”</p><p>She said, “I live alone.” She was a widow, and she was very rich. “I
live alone and I always think about my being alone. If ghosts exist I am
in danger; there is nobody else in my room.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Ghosts not only exist, they are present in this room, in
this house.” She said, “What do you mean?”</p><p>I said, “I will tell you. When this house was made, a washerman lived
here with his very beautiful wife who had only one eye. Her face was
very beautiful – the only trouble was that she had only one eye. The
washerman was recruited into the army during the first world war, and he
died there. The shock was so much to the washerwoman that she did not
believe it. She refused to believe that he was dead; she waited for him
day in, day out. And in this condition, continuously waiting for him,
she was not eating well, she was not taking care of her body. Everybody
tried to convince her: ‘He is dead, he cannot come. You need not sit at
the door the whole day.’</p><p><br></p><p>“But she was absolutely incapable of thinking that he could leave
her. There was a bond between them that they would live together and
they would die together. They loved each other so much. Finally she
died, but because of her desire for the husband to come in search of
her, she became a ghost. And she still lives here.</p><p><br></p><p>“After she died, her small hut was removed and this building was
made, but she still lives here and she still waits. Every night she
comes, and when she comes... you have to understand a signal: she makes
a noise as if somebody is grinding his teeth. Why she does that, I don’t
know – nobody</p><p>knows – but two or three times she comes in the night. And
particularly when somebody is a guest in the house, she is absolutely
certain to come – thinking, hoping, that perhaps her husband has come
back because a guest is in the house.</p><p><br></p><p>“She comes and she takes the blanket off and looks at your face. She
is a very beautiful young woman, but she has only one eye.”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “Nobody told me about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Then don’t tell anybody; otherwise nobody will stay in this
house, and even to sell this house will become impossible. They want to
sell this house and they are keeping quiet about the reality. Once it is
sold they can purchase another house, and then it is somebody else’s
problem; it is not their problem. So they are completely silent about
it. But I told you because you asked me, and I have nothing, no
investment in this house or anything. I simply say whatever is the case
– and this is the case.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just if she comes to your bed and uncovers your face, don’t be
afraid because she is a very innocent woman; she has never harmed
anyone. She just looks at your face, and finding that it is not her
husband, she throws the blanket on your face and goes away. And before
she comes you will hear the grinding of the teeth.”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “My God! This is a dangerous house – and I have stayed so
many times. Perhaps I was asleep when she came. But now I cannot
sleep.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You try; you go and sleep.” Nearabout one she went into the
room inside, and the moment she went there and put her light off, a
great coincidence: she heard the teeth grinding and she shrieked. I
rushed in.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody woke up: “What has happened?” She was flat on the ground;
she could not even reach the bed! She was flat on the ground,
unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>And they told me, “We have been telling you not to create stories
which have no foundation at all. Now it is your duty, your
responsibility to take care of her. First bring her to
consciousness.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I will try, but I don’t think that she is going to come to
consciousness so easily; it is going to take time. And even if she
comes, she will go back again.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “But what have you done to her?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Tomorrow morning I will tell you the whole story when she is
okay.” I tried. I threw cold water in her eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>She came to consciousness and just pointed in the corner: “She is
standing there!” And again she gave another shriek and went
unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>The family asked, “Who is standing in that corner?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I don’t know. Somebody must be standing there. I have heard
there is a ghost.”</p><p>They said, “We never heard any ghost. You have been here only two
months and you have heard that there is a ghost? Who has told you?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Tomorrow morning... First thing is to bring this woman to
consciousness and put her to sleep.” But three or four times it
happened: she would come to consciousness, just look in the corner and
point, “She is standing there... one eye!” The whole night they all had
to remain awake – only I slept.</p><p><br></p><p>In the morning, the woman told them what story I had told her. They
said, “Don’t listen to him. He goes on telling things to people, and it
is strange that people believe – even older people.”</p><p><br></p><p>One man used to live next door to me, and he was a constant visitor.
He was very respected – he was sixty-five, older than anybody else in
the house – and he was a very loving man. He had the best shop in the
city for food. You could not get any better food anywhere; he had the
best quality. He was alone – no wife, no children – and he conceived his
profession as a service to thousands of people. So it was not only his
profession, it was something like a religious duty: everything had to be
the best and for the very minimum profit.</p><p><br></p><p>I had told him about this woman. He said, “I don’t believe in ghosts;
I am a believer in God. I don’t believe in ghosts at all.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It is not a question of belief, it is a reality. Just one
day you can come and sleep in this room.” He said, “Why should I come
and sleep in this room?”</p><p>I said, “That shows that certainly you are afraid; just one night...
You sleep just in the house next door. You are alone so there is no
problem; you can sleep here. I will give you the evidence.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “But why should I try it?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You said that you don’t believe in ghosts, and I said they
exist and there is a woman who comes, but she comes only when there is a
new guest, so if you are willing you can do it.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the same thing happened to that man. He went to bed but he could
not sleep because he was waiting for the woman to come – and then came
the grinding of teeth. That was certain; it was guaranteed that at least
three times in the night he was going to grind his teeth.</p><p><br></p><p>And as he ground his teeth, the man simply threw off his blanket and
rushed into my room, woke me up, and said, “She has come!”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Who?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “The woman you were talking about. I believe in ghosts; just
this is enough. But no more than this! I have heard the sound, and I
don’t want to get into all that trouble that that other woman had” –
because the story had spread all over the city that that woman... She
stopped coming to the house because she became so afraid. She had a
constant fever for three or four days; even after she became conscious
and went to her home she had a fever, the fear went so deep.</p><p>And the old man said, “I don’t want to get into that trouble. Just
open the door and let me go to my home!”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You are such a God-believing person. This is the time to
test your God.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am not going to listen to you; you are a dangerous
fellow. God? I don’t know whether he exists or not, but the ghost
certainly exists! I have heard just now... she is grinding her teeth!”
And he was an old man and a very religious person, every day going to
the temple and chanting mantras and all that.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I can say... but you just open the door and let me go to my
home! I will never say again that God exists; I will always say the
ghost exists. But let me go! I have enough evidence. More than that... I
am an old man. Something may happen to my heart or...”</p><p><br></p><p>The whole family gathered: “What is happening?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Nothing, but he has heard that ghost again, and I have been
telling him, ‘You are such a God-loving person: a ghost cannot do
anything to you.’”</p><p><br></p><p>My family said, “You are... why do you talk about these things?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I don’t talk... he himself started it. And it became a
question of God versus ghost. So I said I don’t know that God exists but
I know that the ghost exists.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the whole family knew that it was my own fiction but they all
started believing in it. They said, “Perhaps there is something in it.
Once was okay... that woman was influenced because she was listening to
him alone deep in the night. But this old man is a religious man and he
is respected, and he is behaving like a child!”</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody would sleep in that room where these things had happened – not
even the people who were living in the house. Nobody was ready to; they
would say, “If you want to, you can sleep there.”</p><p><br></p><p>And I said, “But I have my room and that room is not better than my
room so I don’t want to change.” But in the night if they wanted
something from that room – it became just a place to collect things
because nobody was ready to live there – they would tell me, “You go
first, then we will follow.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You don’t understand: even if the ghost is there she is not
afraid of me.”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “We don’t want to listen to anything. If we see you going
there then we are certain that there is no danger, but first you have to
go in; take the torch and enter.” When they wanted something from the
room in the middle of the night, or even in the day, they could not go
by themselves. Nobody was ready. Even children would run through that
room, they would not walk. That room became so famous that when they
wanted to sell the house, nobody was ready to purchase it, and they
said, “Now you find a purchaser. You have destroyed this house’s value.
It is a beautiful house and people call it a ghost house.”</p><p><br></p><p>And I said, “You know that there is no ghost.”</p><p>They said, “We know, but knowing is not enough in these matters; the
feeling is the point. The fear of two persons... neither of them has
come back again to the house. We call the old man sometimes to come but
he says, ‘Never again in that house! I remember that night when he would
not open the door – because the key was with him – and I am feeling so
guilty that I had to confess, out of my fear, that God does not exist
and ghosts exist. Now I am doing prayer twice – morning and evening –
convincing God that I believe in him: You exist. These ghosts etcetera
don’t exist.’”</p><p><br></p><p>Mind can project any experience. That woman really saw the
washerwoman as I had described. In the morning she described her
exactly: a beautiful woman with long hair and one eye, wearing a red
sari with a black border. She said, “If I was a painter I could paint
her exactly. I can close my eyes and still see her.”</p><p><br></p><p>The techniques used for spiritual growth are not different. The Sufi
master could not stay with me for three days, but leaving me he finally
said to me, “I am grateful. I will have to start my journey again. I can
see what has happened: first I just started projecting. I knew that a
table is a table, a chair is a chair, but I started projecting that it
is God, that it is luminous with God’s existence. And I knew that it is
just my idea. But forty years! Slowly slowly it became the reality. But
you have shown me that that technique was simply creating an
hallucination.”</p><p><br></p><p>There have been many people – many so-called great saints, prophets,
messiahs – who have lived in hallucination, who never knew about the
simple natural process of watchfulness.</p><p><br></p><p>It is better that you don’t get involved with any technique.
Watchfulness is so pure; don’t pollute it with anything else. And it is
so entire, so complete, that it needs no other support. But mind always
wants some technique, because mind can control the technique. Mind is a
technician; technology is its field. But watchfulness is beyond its
control. It is beyond it, it is above it, and in fact it is the death of
the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>If watchfulness grows in you, mind will die.</p><p><br></p><p>And all these people, like Maharishi Mahesh Yogi teaching
transcendental meditation, are giving techniques which mind feels
perfectly good with. The mind can use it. But there is not going to be
any growth. The technique is not bad, but it simply gives you an
illusory feeling of well-being – as if you are evolving... and you are
standing where you have been; there is no evolution, no growth. All
these people are exploiting humanity by giving techniques – and this is
the worst exploitation because it stops evolution.</p><p><br></p><p>I am against all techniques.</p><p><br></p><p>I am for a simple, natural process, which you already have, which
once in a while you use.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are angry, how do you become aware that you are angry? If
there was only anger and nobody watching it, you could not become aware
of the anger. Anger itself cannot become aware.</p><p><br></p><p>So you are aware when you are angry, when you are not angry, when you
are feeling good, when you are not feeling good. But you have not used
this watchfulness consistently, scientifically, deeply, totally in every
phase of the mind. And to me this word contains the very essence of
meditation.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IN DISCOURSE THE OTHER NIGHT YOU SAID THAT AT ONE’S DEATH THERE IS
BUT A TWO OR THREE SECOND GAP BETWEEN WHICH THE SOUL TRAVELS FROM ONE
BODY TO THE NEXT. MASTER, YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOUR LAST LIFE WAS SEVEN
HUNDRED YEARS AGO. WHERE WERE YOU FOR ALL THOSE YEARS?</p><p><br></p><p>Just here, in Uruguay! Where else could I be? The whole existence is
available. When you are not in a body, you are just part of the whole
existence without any partition.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason why I had to remain seven hundred years... A few people
don’t get into the next life immediately. Either the person is so
wicked, so animalistic, so murderous, like Adolf Hitler... He is not yet
reborn because he needs a certain kind of womb which may not be
available for thousands of years: he has to wait. Or if you have
attained a certain evolved consciousness there is the same problem: you
need a certain womb. Unless that is available, you cannot get another
birth.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily it is two or three seconds, because for the sleeping
humanity the same kind of wombs are available. All day long millions of
people are making love, and they are giving opportunities for new people
to enter into a womb. So for the masses there is no problem; they don’t
have to wait. It is almost instantaneous: as they leave one body,
immediately some womb somewhere is ready. And they get into the closest
womb.</p><p><br></p><p>By the way, if you are born in Germany, then for many lives you may
be born in Germany for the simple reason that if you remain just part of
the mass there is no reason to go far away to China or Japan and be born
there. Just around you there are wombs ready to receive you.</p><p><br></p><p>In my experiments I have seen that people ordinarily continue in the
same environment unless something starts growing in them and they cannot
find the right womb in close proximity. Then they change. Then they move
to different countries, to different races, to different peoples.</p><p><br></p><p>But in these extremes – either you are too cursed or too blessed –
you will have to wait, because only once in a while a womb is ready for
such a person. The father has to have certain qualities, the mother
needs to have certain qualities, and only if their qualities are
symmetrical with his own qualities can a certain soul enter. So it is
not only that you carry your parents’ blood and your parents’ bones and
your parents’ cells; there is something even deeper than that. You have
certain qualities which are exactly those of your parents, but you have
not acquired them from your parents – you had them, that’s why you got
those parents.</p><p><br></p><p>Unembodied, you are just part of existence. It is difficult to
explain to you where you are because “where” indicates a certain space;
“when” indicates a certain time. But as you leave the body, you go
beyond time and space both, so there is no way to say where you are. You
are: time has stopped for you, space has disappeared for you.</p><p><br></p><p>You will remain in this state blissfully – if it is bliss that is
preventing you from finding a new womb – or very miserably, if you are
stuck because of misery, because of anguish, because of all the evil
that you have done.</p><p>Adolf Hitler killed millions of people, at least six million people,
and then he committed suicide himself – and all for no purpose. The
whole thing was absolutely useless. Now to find parents of similar
qualities, similar criminal minds, he will have to wait. But all this
waiting will be an intense suffering.</p><p><br></p><p>My own understanding is that because of these situations, the idea of
heaven and hell has arisen. There is no hell and there is no heaven,
just people who get stuck and cannot find a womb. If they are in
anguish, misery, darkness, all the torture they have done to other
people starts having its effects on them. They live in utter
self-torture. And this is why the idea of hell has been created;
otherwise there is no hell. But it has a meaning, a symbolic
meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>Those seven hundred years were absolutely blissful for me, and I can
say that anybody who has experienced that kind of bliss beyond time and
space will naturally think he is in paradise. But there is no paradise;
this existence is all. Either you are in the body... then you have a
chance to evolve; without the body you cannot evolve. The body is a kind
of school. It gives you all the situations for evolution. I know my
seven hundred years were blissful, but I could not move ahead; it was
frozen bliss. In that state there is no possibility to grow: you will
remain at the same point until you are born again, and then you can
start growing. A body is needed to grow.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you have attained the whole possibility of growth, the whole
spectrum, there is no need for any evolution; you have come to the full
point. Then you will not be coming back into the body. There is no need
to come back to the school; you have learned everything. Now you can
remain part of existence for eternity, with eternal bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>The body has to be respected, loved, because it is your vehicle for
growth, for moving ahead. Without it you cannot move. That’s why I am
continuously surprised that the religions have created the idea that the
body is something anti-spiritual. The body is what you want it to be: it
can be anti-spiritual, it can be for spirituality. It is a vehicle:
wherever you want to go it can take you; in itself it has no program.
The body is very innocent and without any program.</p><p><br></p><p>The fact that all the religions have condemned the body has harmed
humanity, because those who have condemned the body have stopped using
the possibility of the body to take you to higher states. On the
contrary, they have started harming the body. They have been destructive
to the body, and that is not going to help. They are destroying their
own vehicle.</p><p><br></p><p>But it seems that the fact that people who have attained
enlightenment have not entered into the body again has given a false
idea to the priests, to the scholars – to those who don’t know and yet
think they know. The idea has come to them that since you don’t enter
into the body again after you become enlightened, that means that the
body is not spiritual; it is anti-spiritual. You are in the body only
because you are not enlightened, so fight with the body, torture the
body, make yourself free of the body. But the methods they are using
will not make them free of the body; they will get more entangled with
the body. But nobody cares to look into all the implications of
anything.</p><p><br></p><p>It is true that the enlightened person never enters the body, but the
opposite is not true – that if you don’t enter the body you will be
enlightened, or if you destroy the body you will be enlightened. The
very idea of destructiveness, torture, is unspiritual, and the person
who can destroy himself can easily destroy anybody. If he can torture
himself it is very easy for him to torture anybody.</p><p>Perhaps people like Adolf Hitler were your so-called saints in the
past. They have tortured their bodies so much that now this is a
reaction; the pendulum has moved to the other extreme: now they are
torturing other people. Otherwise there is no reason why people should
torture other people. What enjoyment can they get in torturing other
people? There must be some reason behind it – they have tortured
themselves enough. So now it becomes a vicious circle: you torture
yourself, then you are born in a body and you torture others; and
because you torture others, you are born again in a body and you torture
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hindustani word for the world is samsara. India has been very
careful about its language: each word has its own philosophical
background. Samsara means the wheel which goes on moving. The only way
to jump out of the wheel is to be watchful, because watchfulness is
already outside the wheel. If you become accustomed to watchfulness, you
are suddenly out of the wheel. But if you get identified with anger,
with jealousy, with love, with hate – with any kind of thing – then you
are caught up with the wheel.</p><p><br></p><p>And the wheel goes on moving from one extreme to another. What is
down will be up, what is up will be down – and there is no end to it
unless somebody simply jumps out. And the only way to jump out is to
become aware of your anger, of your love, of your hate, of your misery,
of your joy. Just being watchful you are already out of the wheel – the
goose is out.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THE DARKNESS SEEMS SO DEEP, MY EYES COVERED IN A HAZE, MY MIND NEVER-
ENDING NOISE – EXCEPT FOR THOSE MOMENTS I AM WITH YOU – SWIRLING AROUND
AND AROUND. THE LIGHT IS THERE BUT SEEMS SO FAR AWAY IN ALL THIS
DARKNESS. SOMETIMES I WONDER IF I AM GOING TO MAKE IT. BELOVED MASTER, I
CANNOT FIND THE DOOR.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be worried. You don’t need to find the door, because you are
outside the door! You are never inside, you only believe you are inside.
Existentially, you are always outside. The moment you understand that
you are out – it was just an idea that you were in – the faraway light
is no longer far away; it is you. And the darkness that surrounds you is
not found anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>But the basic thing is to realize that you are already outside the
door. There is no way for you to be inside the door. That’s what I was
saying: watchfulness is not part of the mind and cannot be part of the
mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind cannot be a witness. Mind is the darkness.</p><p>Mind is the whole problem, and the solution is just outside the door
waiting for you to recognize that you are not in, you are out.</p><p><br></p><p>Witnessing the content of your mind, the moment comes when you
suddenly become aware of your being always out – even in the darkest
nights that have passed you were not in. Such a great joy</p><p>descends over you that it is existentially impossible for you to get
in. It is good that you are not finding the door; otherwise you will get
in!</p><p><br></p><p>There is no door. Mind remains in; you remain out. Neither the mind
can come out nor you can come in. But the attachment with the mind is
possible without any door. The identification with the mind is possible
without any door.</p><p><br></p><p>You have just forgotten yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing is lost, nothing is missing, nothing has to be found. Just
remember. A simple remembering – the simplest things are very difficult,
that’s true – and this is the most simple thing.</p><p><br></p><p>None of the problems are yours. As far as you are concerned, no
problem can enter in you, but you can get identified with something
which is not you.</p><p><br></p><p>I remember a story. A man’s house caught fire. The house was on fire,
and it had taken the man’s whole life’s effort to make that beautiful
place. Thousands of people had gathered, but there was nothing that
could be done. The fire had become so big. And you can understand that
man: tears were coming from his eyes. It was his whole life burning in
front of him. And then suddenly his son came running and he said, “Dad,
why are you worried? We sold the house yesterday. You were out... but we
have sold the house. It is now for somebody else to cry and weep, not
for you. And we have got enough profit out of it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man immediately wiped away his tears and became just a spectator
like the others were spectators. The identity, the invisible identity,
“It is my house,” was no longer there. There was no pain, there was no
misery, there was no problem at all. And he was really happy in a way:
“Now we can make a better house.” He was feeling relieved; the house was
burning, and he was feeling relieved.</p><p><br></p><p>And then a second son came running. He said, “It is true that we had
negotiated the sale, but the papers were not signed and the money has
not been transferred. So it is our house that is burning, and you are
looking at it as if you are just a spectator!” Again those tears were
flowing and again the heart was breaking. And nothing has visibly
changed: the house is burning, the man is standing there. But these
people who are bringing messages are changing everything! When he
becomes identified, he is burning with the house. When he gets
unidentified, he is relieved and he has nothing to do with the house; it
is somebody else’s house.</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing to be remembered is that you are already out, and by
nature there is no way for you to be in. You can believe, you can
imagine... still you will be outside. Sitting on the steps of your house
you are trying to find the door to go out. You will never find it, it is
not there; the whole sky is available. You just stand up and walk in any
direction; there is no need of opening any door.</p><p><br></p><p>But your attachment, your identification, is with the mind, which is
in and which cannot come out. It cannot exist in the light. Now this is
the situation: witnessing is always out and cannot enter in; it can
exist only in the light, it cannot exist in darkness. Mind is always in;
it can exist only in darkness, it cannot exist in light.</p><p>Between these two absolutely different things you are having an
identification, an attachment, that is creating the trouble for you.</p><p><br></p><p>So just remember: you are outside. If you cannot do it suddenly, do
it slowly, part by part. When anger is there, watch it, and you will
find anger is in and you are out.</p><p><br></p><p>When Gurdjieff’s father died Gurdjieff was only nine years old. The
father was poor. He called Gurdjieff close to him and told him, “I have
nothing to give you as your inheritance. I am poor, and my father was
also poor, but he gave me one thing that made me the richest man in the
world, although the outside poverty remained. I can only transfer the
same to you.</p><p><br></p><p>“It is some advice. Perhaps you are too young and you may not be able
to do it right now, but remember it. When you are able to act according
to the advice, act according to it. The advice is simple. I will repeat
it, and because I am dying, listen carefully and repeat in front of me
what I have said so I can die satisfied that I have transferred the
message that may have come down from father to son for centuries.”</p><p><br></p><p>The message was simple. The father said, “If somebody insults you,
irritates you, annoys you, just tell him, ‘I have received your message,
but I have promised my father that I will answer only after twenty-four
hours. I know you are angry, I have understood it. I will come after
twenty-four hours and answer you.’ And the same with anything. Give a
gap of twenty-four hours.”</p><p><br></p><p>The nine-year-old boy repeated what the father said, and the father
died, but because it was such a moment the message became engraved. As
he repeated the message, the father said, “Good. My blessings will be
with you, and now I can die peacefully.” He closed his eyes and died.
And Gurdjieff, even though he was nine, started practicing what was
given to him. Somebody would insult him, and he would say, “I will come
after twenty-four hours to answer you because that’s what I have
promised my dying father. Right now I cannot answer you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody might beat him, and he would say, “You can beat me right
now, but I cannot answer. After twenty-four hours I will come and answer
you, because I have promised my dying father.” And later on he used to
say to his disciples, “That simple message transformed me totally. The
person was beating me but I was not going to react at that moment so
there was no question except to watch. There was nothing I had to do:
now the person was beating me, I just had to be a spectator. For
twenty-four hours there was nothing to do.</p><p><br></p><p>“And watching the man created a new kind of crystallization in me.
After twenty-four hours I could see more clearly. At the moment when he
was beating me it was impossible to see clearly. My eyes were full of
anger. If I was going to answer at that moment I would have wrestled
with the man, I would have hit the man, and everything would have been
an unconscious reaction.</p><p><br></p><p>“But after twenty-four hours I could think about it more calmly, more
quietly. Either he was right – I had done something wrong and I needed,
deserved, to be beaten, to be insulted – or he was absolutely wrong. If
he was right, there was nothing to say to him except to go and give him
thanks. If he was absolutely wrong... then there was no point at all in
fighting with a man who is utterly stupid and goes on doing such wrong
things. It is meaningless, it is wasting time. He does not deserve any
answer.”</p><p>So after twenty-four hours everything settled down and a clarity was
there. And with that clarity and the watchfulness of the moment,
Gurdjieff changed into one of the most unique beings of this age. And
this was the basic foundation of the whole crystallization of his
being.</p><p><br></p><p>You are always outside. Just watch.</p><p>The mind is always inside. Don’t be identified with it. Unidentified,
you will become more and more clear, and the mind will die on its own
accord.</p><p><br></p><p>The death of the mind and the birth of watchfulness is the beginning
of your evolution. And the light will not be far away – it is the light.
The darkness will be gone, because when you are light, darkness cannot
be around you. That’s why I said that watchfulness is not a technique,
it is your nature. Just remember it.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part11>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

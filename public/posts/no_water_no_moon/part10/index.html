WHAT HELP COULD YOU BE TO ME?”\nIKKYU ANSWERED, “IF YOU THINK YOU REALLY COME AND GO, THAT IS YOUR DELUSION. LET ME SHOW YOU THE PATH IN WHICH THERE IS NO COMING AND GOING.”\nWITH HIS WORDS, IKKYU HAD REVEALED THE PATH SO CLEARLY THAT NINAKAWA SMILED AND PASSED AWAY.\nDeath is the crescendo, the highest peak that life can attain. In the moment of death much is possible. If you have been preparing and preparing, meditating and waiting, then at the moment of death enlightenment is very easily possible – because death and enlightenment are similar. A master, one who is enlightened, can easily make you enlightened at the moment of death. Even before, whenever it happens, you have to be ready to die.\nWhat happens in death? Suddenly you are losing your body, suddenly you are losing your mind. Suddenly you feel you are going away from yourself – all that you believe to be yourself. It is painful, because you feel you are going to be drowned into emptiness. You will be nowhere now, because you were always identified with the body and the mind, and you never knew the beyond; you never knew yourself beyond the body and the mind. You got so fixed and obsessed with the periphery that the center was completely forgotten.\nIn death you have to encounter this fact: that the body is going, now it cannot be retained any more. The mind is leaving you – now you are no more in control of the mind. The ego is dissolving – you cannot even say ‘I’. You tremble with fear, on the verge of nothingness. You will be no more.\nBut if you have been preparing, if you have been meditating – and preparation means if you have been making all efforts to use death, to use this abyss of nothingness – rather than being pulled into it you have been getting ready to jump into it, it makes a lot of difference. If you are being pulled into it, grudgingly – you don’t want to go into it and you have been snatched – then it is painful. Much anguish! And the anguish is so intense that you will become unconscious in the moment of death. Then you miss.\nBut if you are ready to jump there is no anguish. If you accept and welcome it, and there is no complaint – rather, you are happy and celebrating that the moment has come, and now I can jump out of this body which is a limitation, can jump out of this body which is a confinement, can jump out of this ego which has always been a suffering – if you can welcome, then there is no need to become unconscious. If you can become accepting, welcoming – what Buddhists call tathata, to accept it, and not only to accept, because the word accept is not very good, deep down some nonacceptance is hidden in it – no, if you welcome, if it is such a celebration, an ecstasy, if it is a benediction, then you need not become unconscious.\nIf it is a benediction, you will become perfectly conscious in that moment. Remember these two things: if you reject, if you say no, you will become totally unconscious; if you accept, welcome, and say yes with your full heart, you will become perfectly conscious. Yes to death makes you perfectly conscious; no to death makes you perfectly unconscious – and these are the two ways of dying.\nA Buddha dies totally accepting. There is no resistance, no fight between him and death. Death is divine; you die fighting.\nIf a man has been preparing, getting ready, at the moment of death the master can be miraculously helpful. Just a word at the right moment and the flame inside suddenly explodes, you become enlightened – because the moment is such, so intense, you are so concentrated at one point.\nThis is happening in this story. Ikkyu is one of the greatest masters, a very rare, revolutionary, nonconformist. Once he stayed in a temple. The night was very cold and there were three wooden Buddhas in the temple, so he burned one Buddha to warm himself. The priest became aware – he was fast asleep, it was in the middle of the night and the night was very cold – he became aware that something was going on, so he looked.\nBuddha was burning! – and this man Ikkyu was sitting, happy, warming his hands. The priest became mad; he said, “What are you doing? Are you a madman? – and I thought you to be a Buddhist monk, that’s why I allowed you to stay in the temple. And you have done the most sacrilegious act.”\nIkkyu looked at the priest and said, “But the buddha within me was feeling very cold. So it was a question whether to sacrifice the living Buddha to the wooden one, or to sacrifice the wooden one to the living one. And I decided for life.”\nBut the priest was so mad with anger, he couldn’t listen to what Ikkyu was saying. He said, “You are a madman. You simply get out of here! You have burned Buddha.”\nSo Ikkyu started to poke the burned Buddha – ashes were there, the statue was almost completely finished. He started to poke with a stick. The priest asked, “What are you doing?”\nHe said, “I am trying to find the bones of Buddha.”\nSo the priest laughed, he said, “You are either a fool or a madman. And you are absolutely mad! You cannot find bones there, because it is just a wooden Buddha.”\nIkkyu laughed, he said, “Then bring the other two. The night is still very cold and the morning is still far away.”\nThis Ikkyu was a very rare man. He was turned out immediately, out of the temple. In the morning he was sitting just on the side of the street outside the temple – worshipping a milestone, putting flowers, doing his prayers. So the priest said, “You fool! In the night you misbehaved with Buddha. What have you done? You have committed a sin, and now what are you doing with this milestone? This is not a statue.”\nIkkyu said, “When you want to pray, everything is a statue. At that time the buddha within was feeling very cold. At this time the buddha within is feeling very prayerful.”\nThis man Ikkyu had thousands of disciples all over the country, and he used to wander from one place to another to help disciples. This story is about one of his disciples, Ninakawa. He was just on the verge, almost enlightened. But ‘almost enlightened’ means nothing; you can move back, from the last point also you can fall. Unless it has happened, it has not happened. From the very last moment, when only one step remains and you will become an enlightened one, you can come back. This Ninakawa was almost enlightened but still in the grip of the scriptures, because unless you reach to the truth, it is very difficult to get out of the grip of the scriptures.\nIt is very difficult to get out of the prison of words. It happens only when you are really enlightened. Then you can see that words are just words: nothing is there, they are not substantial, they are made of the stuff dreams are made of. They are just ripples in the mind, nothing else; sounds in the mind. And the meaning? Meaning is given by us; it is not there, no word is meaningful. And any word can become meaningful by common agreement.\nSo it is just a social phenomenon, not concerned with truth at all. But people live by words: if someone says something against Jesus and you are a Christian you will be ready to kill him, or be ready to be killed – it is a question of life and death. Someone says something against Mohammed, a Mohammedan gets mad. Just a word – ‘Mohammed’ is just a word, ‘Jesus’ is just a word – but people live by words.\nI have heard: Once Mulla Nasruddin caught hold of a man on the street and said, “I am in a very difficult situation: my wife is hungry, my children are ill. Will you help me a little?”\nThe man looked at Nasruddin; he was really in a sad plight. He asked, “Why should I help you? But one thing I would like to ask: what brought you to this sad plight? How did you become so miserable? What has happened to you?”\nNasruddin said, “It is a long story. But to say it in short: just a few years ago I was also a businessman like you, and beggars used to catch hold of me on the street. Everything was going wonderfully. Then a catastrophe”\nThe man became interested. He said, “Then what happened?”\nMulla Nasruddin said, “My business was very good, money was pouring in continuously. I was a very industrious worker, totally absorbed in my business. And I had a motto on my table: ‘Think constructively! Act decisively!’ and money continued pouring in. And then...” Mulla Nasruddin’s frame started convulsing and he said, “then my wife burned the motto. That motto, ‘Think constructively! Act decisively!’ – the whole thing depended on that motto. And my wife burned it! That was the greatest catastrophe, and that has led me to this sad plight.”\nHave you ever thought, if your scriptures are burned, what will happen to you? If your mottos are burned, what will happen to you? If your words are burned, what will happen to you? You will be in a very sad plight. That’s why, if someone says anything against the Bible, you become mad. It is not because he is saying something against the Bible – he is burning your motto. You depend on the word. And you depend on the word because you don’t know what truth is. If you come to know what truth is you will throw all the words, you will burn all the mottos.\nMulla Nasruddin seems to be foolish – he is not. He is just a representative human being, the most representative, the normal. He is you, in all your absurdities – but magnified, of course.\nThis Ninakawa was struggling his whole life, meditating, sitting, using many techniques, trying in every way to become calm and quiet and still; but he was still in the grip of scripture. The day he was dying Ikkyu visited him. That was the moment now to push this man into the infinite abyss. He may miss, because at the time of death, if scripture is there, you will miss.\nYou need to be totally vacant, you need to be totally empty; only then can you meet death, because death is emptiness. And only the alike can know the alike, the same can understand the same. If you are filled, even with a single word, you will miss, because then the mind is there – and death has no mind, death has no thought; death is simply falling into emptiness.\nSo Ikkyu came to push this disciple at the last moment. He had been missing his whole life – he should not miss this last moment. And I also tell you: if you miss your whole life, then there is only one possibility and only one hope – at the moment of death. But no need to wait for it, it can happen right now. If it is not happening right now, then go on trying. But get ready for death. If you are ready, I will be there to push you. If you are ready, then it is very easy: just a little jerk, and the mind blows.\nJUST BEFORE NINAKAWA PASSED AWAY THE ZEN MASTER IKKYU VISITED HIM.\nMasters have been visiting always. It may not have actually happened, remember that; it may not have actually happened. It may be, it is possible, that nobody else than Ninakawa saw the master visiting him. It may have actually happened, but that is irrelevant. One thing is certain: that while Ninakawa was dying, just at the last moment the master was there. This dialogue happened with Ninakawa and Ikkyu. There may have been many others there, they may not have heard it at all; they may not have seen Ikkyu coming at all. It was or it was not a physical visit. But it happened, and it did.whatsoever was needed was done.\n“SHALL I LEAD YOU ON?” IKKYU ASKED. NINAKAWA REPLIED...\nA man of scripture, particularly Buddhist, because in Buddhism the guru is not accepted. Buddha is the greatest guru, but in Buddhism the guru is not accepted. They have a reason for it. Because the human mind is so complex, it creates trouble everywhere: the guru is to liberate you, but you can make a bondage out of him. Hindus have been teaching that without the guru, without the master, there is no liberation. And this is true, absolutely true, but by the time of Buddha it became a bondage.\nWithout the guru, without the master, there is no liberation. So people started becoming slaves of masters, because without them there is no liberation. Look at the human mind and the stupidity: a master is to liberate, but you can become a slave to the master because only he can liberate; then you can become just docile. Much slavery was created; nobody else on this earth has created such a deep slavery as Hindus. You cannot come across a single revolution in the whole history of Hinduism against the priest. No – the whole thing was so settled and so fixed and systematized, and everybody was aware that if you rebel against the priest there is no liberation – he is the guru, he is the master.\nThe untouchables – the sudras – have existed in the most miserable condition. They are the greatest of slaves and they have the longest history of slavery, but never have they revolted against it, because it was not possible. The guru, the master, the brahmin – he is the door to the divine. You have missed this life, and if you rebel you miss the other also – so remain a slave.\nThen came Buddha, and he said, “No need for the guru” – not because there is no need for the guru: he said no need for the guru, and he meant no need to become a slave – but that was the only way to say it. So Buddha says, “Be a light unto yourself. Nobody is needed to lead you. Nobody is needed to guide you. You are enough unto yourself.”\nThis is the greatest possibility of being free, of freedom. But you can misuse this also, this is the problem. Then you think that if there is no need for a master, then why listen to the Buddha? If there is no need for the master, then why go to the Buddha? If I am totally independent, then I am Buddha myself. That happened through Buddhism: slavery didn’t happen, but deep egoism happened. But both are the two extremes: either you become an egoist – because no guru, no master, nobody to follow – or you become a slave, because without the guru there is no liberation.\nCan’t you be in the middle? Can’t you just stand in the middle without moving to the extreme? If you can be in the middle, the mind disappears.\nIkkyu came, and he said, “Shall I lead you?”\nIkkyu asked the basic Buddhist question, and Ikkyu knows that if he is still burdened with the scripture he will say, “No, who can lead anybody? Nobody is a guru. Every soul is absolutely independent. I am a light unto myself.” If he is burdened with the scripture, this will be the response. If he is not burdened with the scripture, then the response can be any – infinite possibilities open.\nNINAKAWA REPLIED, “I CAME HERE ALONE...” This is what Buddha says “... I GO ALONE. WHAT HELP COULD YOU BE TO ME?”\nEverybody is born alone, goes alone; and in the middle of these two, coming and going, you may delude yourself that you are with somebody, but you still remain alone. Because if you are in the beginning alone and in the end alone, how in the middle can you be with somebody? The wife, the husband, the friend, the society, are all illusions. You remain alone, aloneness is your nature. You can be deluded, that’s all. You can have dreams, that’s all, but the other remains always the other and there is no meeting point. This is the basic Buddhist teaching to make man free.\nThat’s why Buddha even denied God, because if there is God how can you be alone? He is always there. Even when you are in your bathroom he is there – because he is omnipotent, omnipresent. You cannot escape him; wherever you go he will be there. He is the cosmic eye, the cosmic spy, following you. Whatsoever you do, he will be looking! It is very difficult to escape God; if he is, then he is everywhere. You cannot hide – this is beautiful if you can understand – and religious people used it to help.\nHindus, Mohammedans, Christians, they have all used the omnipresence of God. It is a great help, because if you can really feel God following you like a shadow everywhere, you will become very, very much alert and aware – because he is there. You are not alone, you cannot relax into sin, you cannot relax into ignorance, sleepiness – he is there. The presence will make you alert.\nThis is the right use. But otherwise the presence can become a bondage, a heavy burden, anxiety.\nI have heard about a Christian nun who would not even take her bath in the nude. No, she would continue to have her clothes on even under the shower, so somebody asked, “What are you doing?”\nShe said, “How I can be naked? – because God is everywhere.” But if God is everywhere – in the bathroom – he is inside the clothes also, you cannot escape him. He is inside you. He is everywhere.\nThis can become a deep anxiety, just like when you are taking your bath, and you become aware that somebody is peeping through the keyhole – you become anxious. And God is the cosmic Peeping Tom – he is sitting at every keyhole; you cannot do anything without his knowing it; you make love and he is there. Whatsoever you do he knows, and everything is recorded.\nThis can become a deep anxiety, a neurosis; this can create guilt, and then you have missed. And remember: every key that can open a door can destroy the lock also if you use it wrongly. There is a way, a right way to use a key; only then it opens the lock. If you use it wrongly, the lock may be destroyed. And as the mind is, it always uses keys in a wrong way. Then somebody is needed who must say to you, “Throw this key, because this key is now useless. This is only destroying the lock, not helping you in any way.”\nBuddha said no guru is needed – because in his time the guru meant the brahmin. Krishnamurti is saying the same thing: no guru is needed. But there is another possibility – it may give you freedom. If it gives you freedom it is perfectly okay. But it may give you egoism and that’s the problem, there is the rub. If it gives you egoism, you may not become a slave to somebody else, but you have become a slave to your own ego. And remember, nobody can be such a dangerous master as your ego can be. Nobody can make you so blind as your ego can make you. Nobody can lead you to such hells as your ego can lead you.\nIkkyu just wanted to know whether this man is still clinging to the scriptures, or he has come to understand Buddha. Understanding is different, clinging is different. Clinging is to the dead letter. If he has understood, then Buddha is the greatest master. If he has not understood, then he will not allow; even at the point of death, he will cling to the scriptures.\nIkkyu was standing there, and was asking, “Can I lead you? Shall I lead you on? ... Because the path is unknown. You have never been through it, I have been along it. I know how to die, I know how to celebrate death. I know how to lose yourself into death, and then you never lose; then the real self is born for the first time. I know the secret of dying and rebirth. Can I lead you on?”\nNINAKAWA REPLIED – he refused – he said: “I CAME HERE ALONE, AND I GO ALONE. WHAT HELP COULD YOU BE TO ME?”\nAnd he was in need of help. If he was not in need of help he would have simply laughed, smiled; he would have said, “Thank you.” There was no need to use these words from the scriptures. Why do you use scriptures? They are rationalizations. Whenever you are uncertain you use the scripture, because the scripture is very certain. Whenever you are in doubt, you use Buddha, Krishna, Christ, because they can hide your hesitation, they can hide your reality, they can give you a false confidence.\nWhenever you are using others’ words you are hiding your ignorance. This man was not saying, “I CAME HERE ALONE” – this was not his experience. He was not saying “... AND I GO ALONE.” He was repeating words, and you cannot deceive a master with words.\nIKKYU ANSWERED, “IF YOU THINK YOU REALLY COME AND GO...”\nThese are the most beautiful words ever uttered – the essence of all the Upanishads, the essence of all Buddhas and Mahaviras, just in one sentence.\n“IF YOU THINK YOU REALLY COME AND GO, THAT IS YOUR DELUSION. LET ME SHOW YOU THE PATH ON WHICH THERE IS NO COMING AND NO GOING.”\nThis is really very difficult and subtle.\nSays Ikkyu, “If you think you really come and go, then the ego is there. Who comes? Who goes? If you think you come and go, you don’t know; then you are simply repeating Buddha’s words” – there is the catch.\nIf you have come to know that, “I come alone, and I go alone,” then there is no coming and no going, because the soul is never born, never dies. Life is an eternal continuum. It continues. It never comes, never goes. This body may have been born, this body may die – but that life, the energy, the self, the soul, or whatsoever you call the consciousness that exists in this body, has never been born and will not die. That consciousness is continuous. There has never been any break in it.\nIf you really know, then you know that there is no coming, no going. Who comes? Who goes? If you don’t understand, if you have not realized this, then you will say, “I come alone.” But then this ‘I’ is the ego; then this ‘I’ is not the self. When you say, “I go alone,” the emphasis is on ‘I’ – and the ‘I’ is\nthe bondage. If there is no ‘I’, suddenly you will see that you have never been born, and are never going to die; then there is no beginning and no end.\nSays Jesus... somebody asked Jesus, “Are you the messiah we have been waiting for? Who are you? Tell us about you.”\nJesus said, “Before Abraham was, I am.”\nAbraham must have been thousands of years before, and Jesus says, “Before Abraham was, I am.” The sentence is really very absurd, logically absurd, grammatically wrong: “Before Abraham was, I am.” Abraham is in the past; Jesus says, “Before he was...” and Abraham is the first prophet. There is every possibility that Abraham is just a changed name of Ram, because in old Hebrew it is not Abraham, it is Abram. And Ab simply means respect, just like Shree Ram; it is just to pay respect. There is every possibility that Abraham is no one else than Ram.\nSays Jesus, “Before Abraham was, I am.” For Abraham he uses the past tense: he has been and is no more; the manifestation was there and now is no more. But “I am,” because “I am always: I was, I am here, I will be.”\nThe innermost consciousness knows no birth, no death; knows no past, no present, no future; knows no time. It is eternal, and eternity is not part of time.\nSaid Ikkyu, “IF YOU THINK YOU REALLY COME AND GO – if you think that there is a coming and going – YOU ARE IN DELUSION. LET ME SHOW YOU THE PATH ON WHICH THERE IS NO COMING AND GOING.”\nWhat have buddhas been doing? They have simply been show-ing you that you are perfect – as you are. No change is needed. You have not to go anywhere, you have not to move a single inch. As you are, you are in your perfect glory, here and now. There is no coming and no going. Just become aware of the phenomenon that you are. Just become aware who you are! Just be alert! And then nothing is to be achieved, no effort is to be made, because from the very beginning, before Abraham was, you are. You have seen the creation of the world, you will see the end of the world, but there is no beginning to you and no end to you.\nYou are the witness, and the witness cannot have any beginning and cannot have any end. If you had been alert you would have seen your own birth. If you can die consciously, you will see that death is happening in the body and you are just an onlooker. So the body dies, and you are just the witness. And if you can be a witness in the death, then in the next life, in the birth, you will be a witness. You will see that the mind is choosing a womb: hovering all around the earth, finding a woman, a couple, making love – you will see it.\nJust as if you are hungry: you go to the market, and you can be a witness that your eyes, your mind is looking at the hotels, restaurants, to find the right place where you can have your food. You are hungry, but if you get too identified with the hunger then you cannot be a witness. Otherwise, hunger is there, but you are not the hunger. How can you be the hunger? – otherwise who will know that you are hungry?\nHunger, to be known, needs someone else beyond the hunger who can look and see, who can become alert. If you can become alert in hunger, then you can see how your mind is searching for a right place to have your food. The same happens after death: your mind is in search of a right womb. You choose, you see what is happening.\nIf you are in search of a particular womb, if you are a very good soul or a very bad soul, then you may take many years to find a right womb – very difficult. If you are just an ordinary person, just normal, nothing special good or bad, neither a Hitler nor a Gandhi, then you can be born immediately; there is no need, because everywhere ordinary, normal, standard wombs are available. Then, this moment you die and the next moment you are born – not even a single moment is lost.\nBut for a Hitler it may take many, many years – and it is good, we are fortunate, because he is a very perverted soul, very perverted. You cannot imagine his perversion, he perverted everything. And whenever a man becomes perverted, the first thing to be perverted is his love, because sex remains the root of your being. The first thing to be perverted is sex. When sex goes wrong, everything goes wrong; when sex is natural, everything remains natural.\nStudy Hitler’s sexual life and you will be simply amazed; you cannot believe what he was doing. He would find beautiful women, but would never make love to them. What would he do? You cannot imagine! He would force those beautiful women... he would sit down and he would force them that they should urinate on his head. What type of man...? What is he doing? And he enjoyed it very much: not only urination, they should also defecate on him. And the women felt very guilty – what is he doing? – but he was such a powerful man: if you don’t follow him... he killed many. All his beloveds were either killed by him or they committed suicide – because this is such a perversion! But he felt very good. What was the matter?\nHe was so guilty he wanted to punish himself; even through love he was punishing. He was so guilty, and the guilt was so strong... if you are so guilty you cannot love, because love can only come of the heart of one who is not guilty, who doesn’t feel any guilt, who is just a child, innocent. Then love flows, then it becomes a celebration. But if you are guilty, then through love you start punishing yourself, or you start punishing the other. You cannot enjoy love, because you feel you are so guilty, so bad – how you can enjoy love? You create a hell out of love. This seems impossible, because outside his room Hitler is almost a god, people worship him. And inside his room he feels himself so inferior, guilty, condemned, that he wants to punish himself, even through love.\nThis type of man will not easily find a womb – almost impossible. For centuries he will have to wait, only then he can find such a womb, such a man and such a woman making love, who are so guilt-ridden, so condemned in themselves, only then can he choose the womb. But this happens unconsciously, so you need not worry much about it. You die unconsciously, unconsciously you are born – it happens automatically. The mind moves, just gropes in the dark and enters a womb. But if you die consciously, then the next birth is going to be conscious.\nIf you die consciously and are born consciously you will know that there is no birth and no death, only a body has been chosen. You remain the same, only the house changes. If you change your old clothes, do you say this is a new birth, I am born? No, because you have only changed the clothes; you remain the same.\nThis is how one who becomes alert comes to know that all changes are just changes of dresses and houses and places, situations, circumstances, but you remain the same; the center never changes, it is eternal.\nSays Ikkyu, “IF YOU THINK YOU REALLY COME AND GO THAT IS YOUR DELUSION. LET ME SHOW YOU THE PATH ON WHICH THERE IS NO COMING AND GOING.”\nWhat is that path? Is there really a path? Because we have to use language, that’s why he says ‘path’. Otherwise there is no path, because a path always leads somewhere. No path can lead to you because you are already there. If you want to come to me there is a path, has to be. If you come to somebody you have to follow a path, go through a passage, a bridge, something or other – because you are moving outward. But if you want to go inward there is no path. You are already there. A sudden jerk is needed and you simply feel that you are there.\nIt is just like when you dream in the night: you fall into sleep in Poona, and in the dream you are back at your London home, or in New York, or in Calcutta, or in Tokyo, and in the dream you completely forget that you are in Poona. Then what is needed? Just a jerk. Somebody comes and wakes you up. Will you wake up in London, Tokyo, New York, or in Poona? It would have been very difficult, it will create a very absurd world, if you are dreaming of New York and suddenly somebody wakes you and you wake up in New York! Then this world would have been a nightmare. But you wake up in Poona; the dream disappears.\nBuddhas have been teaching this: that there is no need to go anywhere, because you are already there where you want to go; but you are in a dream. Only in a dream have you moved from the center – you cannot move from there. You are there. For millions of lives you may have been dreaming, but you have not moved from the center where you are. Nobody can move. Just a jerk, just somebody to shock you... you become alert and suddenly the dream disappears. The dreamland and New York and London, they disappear, and you are here and now.\nThis jerk, this shock can be given very easily at the moment of death – because the whole body- mind is going through a great change. Everything is in chaos. In a chaos you can be made alert more easily because everything is uncomfortable. When everything is comfortable it is difficult to bring a man out of the dream – nobody really wants to come out of a comfortable dream. Only when the dream becomes a nightmare, then you scream.\nI have heard: One night Mulla Nasruddin screamed so loudly that even the neighbors came to ask what has happened. Mulla Nasruddin was sitting on his bed weeping, tears flowing down, and his wife was consoling him, saying, “It was just a dream Nasruddin. Why are you creating so much nuisance? – the neighbors have come, there is a crowd.”\nNasruddin said, “But the dream was such... let me first tell you the dream. In the dream I went to a wife auction – such beautiful women. One woman fetched ten thousand rupees, another five thousand, and many for thousands.\n“I had no money. I tried and tried but there was no money. I looked in all my pockets” – and he had one pocket, he would never look in it – he said, “I even looked in that pocket.”\nThere was a special pocket he would never look in. And if something was lost people would ask, “Have you looked in all the pockets? Why not in this one?”\nHe would say, “Because that still gives me hope. If I look in that pocket also, hope is gone, because I think there maybe still is a possibility... but I never look in it because I know well it is not there.”\nHe said, “I looked even in that special pocket – and no money. I was weeping and crying.”\nBut his wife was not interested in this. She asked, “Nasruddin, and were there wives there like me also?” She asked foolishly, as any woman will ask, because no woman is interested in other beautiful women; rather, she felt jealous. She asked, “What about wives like me? How much were they fetching?”\nNasruddin said, “That’s why I screamed. Wives like you those people had put in bundles. One dozen, two dozen – they were selling wives like you at one rupee a bunch. That’s why I screamed: no money to purchase, and that was what was happening to my wife!”\nBut he was crying and weeping even out of the dream.\nDreams are effective, they go deep, because in an unconscious mind the distinction is really very vague; what is dream and what is real is very vague. They are mixed, the boundaries are not so clear-cut, the boundaries are blurred.\nHave you seen a child waking, and weeping because he has lost a toy he saw in the dream? “I am looking around for the toy – where has the toy disappeared to?”\nBut this child never dies in you. It dies only when you make much effort to become alert; only then the dream and the reality become clear-cut distinctions. And once the vagueness is lost, once the boundaries are not blurred, once you become aware what is dream, what is reality, the dream stops – because then the dream cannot continue. If you have become aware the dream cannot continue. Even in a dream, if you become aware that this is a dream, the dream will stop immediately.\nSo you never become aware in a dream that this is a dream, you always feel this is real. For anything to continue, your feeling is needed that this is real. You give reality through the feeling. If you withdraw the feeling, the dream disappears and only the reality remains.\nIt is a dream that you are in this world, and it is the reality that you exist in the divine. It is a dream that you are in the market; it is the reality that you have never moved from the very center of existence, from God. It is a dream you have moved in the market – and a dream can continue, there is no time limit. If you think you are the body, this is a dream – you have never been a body. If you think you are born and you die, this is a dream – you have never been born and you can never die; that is impossible.\nSaid Ikkyu, “This is your delusion if you say, ‘I come and I go.’ There is no one to come and no one to go. And there is no place to come to and no place to go to. Let me show you the pathless path. Because then there can be no path – because if there is no one to come and no one to go, no place to come to and no place to go to, then how can the path exist? So let me show you the pathless path on which there is no coming and no going.”\nWITH HIS WORDS, IKKYU HAD REVEALED THE PATH SO CLEARLY THAT NINAKAWA SMILED AND PASSED AWAY.\nIt happened! You have heard the words – but you are not Ninakawa, you are not that ready, you are not on your deathbed – that’s the problem. You are still hoping for something in life, your dream still has much meaning for you, you have investments in your dream. You may have a desire to come out of the dream, but this desire is only half-hearted. The other part goes on saying, “Dream it a little more, it is so beautiful.”\nOne night Mulla Nasruddin called his wife and said, “Bring my specs, because I have been seeing a beautiful dream and much more is promised to me. Bring my specs, because the place is not so well lighted, and I cannot see clearly.”\nYou may be having nightmares; in those moments you feel, “How to drop out of the dream?” – but you have beautiful dreams also; not only hellish dreams, you have heavenly dreams. And that’s the problem: unless you become aware that even a heavenly dream is a dream and useless, you are not on the deathbed. Your desire continues, you go on watering the world of dreams, feeding it, helping it to grow.\nNinakawa was on his deathbed, he was dying, there was no future left. He was in a chaos. The whole system, the whole adjustment of body, mind and soul was getting looser and looser. Things were falling apart, he was not together. The nightmare was intense, because it is most intense in death. He was simply miserable in that moment: death and no future.\nIf there is no future you cannot dream, because dreams need space, time to move. That’s why death looks so dangerous, because it allows no time to think. You cannot hope, because there is no tomorrow. Death does not kill you, it simply kills the tomorrow, and tomorrow has been your very existence. You have never lived today, you have been always postponing for tomorrow. And death kills the tomorrow, it simply burns your calendar – suddenly the clock stops, time doesn’t move.\nWithout time what can you do? How can the mind think, desire, dream? Death closes the door – that is the fear.\nWhy does death make you so afraid and trembling and scared? Because there seems to be no beyond, no possibility to escape from it. You cannot do anything because you cannot think, and you know only one thing: thinking, nothing else. Your whole life has been a thinking. Now, death allows no thinking. Only a man who has been meditating and has realized no-thinking before death will not be afraid – because he knows that thinking is not life.\nAnd he knows a different plenum of existence. He knows the depth, not the length of existence. He is not moving from this moment to that, he is not moving from today to tomorrow. He is moving in this moment, deeper and deeper and deeper; in today, deeper and deeper and deeper. He is moving here and now, in the depth.\nYou touch this moment and you move to another moment; you have a horizontal movement: from A to B, from B to C, from C to D. And a man who meditates goes on moving from A1 to A2 to A3 – in the depth – not to B. He has no tomorrow. This here and now is the only existence, then how\ncan there be death for him? This moment you are alive; only in the next moment can you die. This moment no one has ever died. This moment you are alive, and this man who meditates moves into this moment – how can he die?\nDeath will happen on the periphery; he will come to know about it. It will be just as you come to know about a neighbor who is dead: he will come to know about it, that the body is dead – this will be news. He may even feel sorry for the body, but he is not dying.\nNinakawa was a meditator just on the verge of enlightenment, still clinging. You can take a jump into the abyss, but still you can cling to a creeper – and you can go on clinging, afraid. You are almost in the abyss, sooner or later you will fall, but still for a moment more the mind says, “Cling!” He was clinging to the scriptures, to the buddhas, to the words, the doctrines. He was still repeating knowledge. Just a creeper – sooner or later he will have to leave this, because when life leaves you, how can words be retained? They will leave you.\nWith this, Ikkyu’s revelation, he understood, he left the clinging. He smiled and passed away.\nYou never smile. Either you weep or you laugh, but you never smile. A smile is just in the middle, it is difficult for you. Either you weep or you laugh – they are the possibilities, the two extremes. Try to find out what this phenomenon of a smile is.\nOnly a buddha smiles, because it is just in the middle. A smile has both a sadness in it, the sadness of the tears, and the happiness of laughter. A smile has both. Smiling is never simple laughter: it has the expansion of laughter and the depth of sadness – it is both. Look at Buddha, meditate on him, and you will see in his face both a sadness and a happiness; a blissful flowing of his being and still a deep sadness.\nWith these two chemicals, so to say, a smile is created. When you feel sad for everybody, when you feel sad for the whole existence because they are unnecessarily suffering.You cannot imagine the\nsadness of a buddha, it is difficult for you. You only think that a buddha is happy. He is happy as far as he himself is concerned, but for you? You cannot conceive his difficulty – because he sees you, and you are unnecessarily suffering, and nothing can be done, you cannot be helped. A disease that is not there – and incurable! And he knows that just by the corner, just a turn of your being, and everything will be solved. But you will not take that turn. You will jump and you will do many things, but you will always miss that turn. You will grope in the dark, but somehow, miraculously, you always miss the door. You know how to miss the door, you are perfect in that: how to miss the door and always go on groping.\nA buddha is in difficulty because he has realized something which is there with you already. The same blissful existence, the same beauty, the same ecstasy that he has, you have. And you go on crying, and you go on beating your chest, and you are in such a suffering – and nothing can be done. A sadness...\nIt is said about Buddha that when he reached the door – the final door beyond which there is no door, and you cannot come back; that is the ultimate – when he reached the door of nirvana, the door was opened for him and there was welcome. Because once in millions of years somebody reaches to the ultimate. But he turned his back towards the door and looked at the world – and they say he is still standing there, he has not entered.\nThe doorkeeper asked, “What are you doing? You have been endeavoring for this for many, many lives. Now the door is open, come in.”\nAnd Buddha said, “Unless everybody who is suffering out there enters, I cannot enter. I will be the last to enter.” This is the sadness.\nThe story is really beautiful. Nobody can stand at that ultimate door, that’s true; there is no door like that and no doorkeeper. You fall, and there is no way to stop yourself. The story is beautiful; that shows in a symbolic way the consciousness of a buddha – the trouble, his anguish, his suffering. It is not his suffering now, it is the suffering of others that makes him sad.\nIt is as if you have awakened but everybody else is fast asleep, and they are dreaming and dreaming nightmares – screaming, jumping, crying, weeping, and you know that these are just nightmares, but these people are so drunk and so fast asleep, you cannot help. If you try to wake them up they become angry. They say, “Why are you disturbing our sleep? Who are you?” You cannot wake them, and you have to see their suffering, and suffer it.\nBuddha is sad – for you. Buddha laughs deeply, his whole being is filled with laughter – just like a tree has come to flower, everything has become a dance. And these both meet in him: the laughter that bubbles and goes on coming out – and still he cannot laugh because of you – and the sadness that you create. They both meet and the meeting creates a smile. A smile is both laughter and tears.\nYou cannot smile – you can laugh, you can weep. When you weep, how can you laugh? Because in weeping it is always for yourself; it is a single element. When you laugh, you laugh; how can you weep? – because laughing is for yourself. In Buddha, the ego has disappeared, now he is no more, the meeting has happened with the all. Two elements meet: his consciousness which has become perfect, and all around millions of consciousnesses which are perfect, suffering – unnecessarily suffering, suffering without any cause – these two meet, and a sad and yet happy smile comes to his face.\nHe cannot weep because what you are doing is so foolish. He cannot laugh because that will be too hard on you. At the most he can smile. This happened, so a smile has become a symbol of one who has become enlightened.\nWITH HIS WORDS, IKKYU HAD REVEALED THE PATH SO CLEARLY THAT NINAKAWA SMILED AND PASSED AWAY.\nThen it was not a death, but just a passing – passing to another world, a passing to another birth; then nobody was dying. And if you can die with a smile you know the art of dying, and the whole of religion consists in the art of dying, nothing else than that.\nNow I will repeat the first story we started, so that you don’t forget it: forgetfulness is a trick.\nThese ten days we have been talking about No Water, No Moon. It will remain just a talk – words and words and words – if you are not ready to die. Be on your deathbed! Be a Ninakawa! Then these words are so clear, as Ikkyu’s never were. I tell you: these words are as clear as Ikkyu’s never were. You can also smile and pass away – remember:\nTHE NUN CHIYONO STUDIED FOR YEARS, BUT WAS UNABLE TO FIND ENLIGHTENMENT.\nONE NIGHT, SHE WAS CARRYING AN OLD PAIL FILLED WITH WATER. AS SHE WAS WALKING ALONG, SHE WAS WATCHING THE FULL MOON REFLECTED IN THE PAIL OF WATER.\nSUDDENLY, THE BAMBOO STRIPS THAT HELD THE PAIL TOGETHER, BROKE, AND THE PAIL FELL APART. THE WATER RUSHED OUT; THE MOON’S REFLECTION DISAPPEARED – AND CHIYONO BECAME ENLIGHTENED.\nAFTERWARDS, SHE WROTE THIS POEM:\nTHIS WAY AND THAT WAY,\nI TRIED TO KEEP THE PAIL TOGETHER, HOPING THE WEAK BAMBOO\nWOULD NEVER BREAK.\nSUDDENLY THE BOTTOM FELL OUT. NO MORE WATER;\nNO MORE REFLECTION OF THE FULL MOON IN THE WATER –\nEMPTINESS IN MY HAND.\nGo with emptiness in your hand, because that’s all... that’s all I can offer to you, and nothing is greater than that. This is my gift: go with emptiness in your hand. If you can carry emptiness in your hand, then everything becomes possible. Don’t carry possessions, don’t carry knowledge, don’t carry anything that fills the pot and becomes the water, because then you will be seeing only the reflection. In wealth, in possessions, in houses, in cars, in prestige, you will see only the reflection of the full moon. And the full moon is there waiting for you.\nLet the bottom drop! Don’t try this way and that way to protect the old pail. It is not worth it. Don’t protect yourself, it is not worth it. Let the pail break down, let the water flow, let the moon in the water disappear, because only then will you be able to raise your eyes towards the real moon. It is always there in the sky – but emptiness in the hand is needed. Remain more and more empty, think yourself more and more empty, behave more and more as if you are empty. By and by, by and by, you will have the taste of it. And once the taste comes, it is so beautiful.\n\u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"8670","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_water_no_moon/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_water_no_moon/>No Water, No Moon</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">10 Ninakawa Smiles</h1><div class=post-meta>41 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8670 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/No_Water_No_Moon/part10.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p><span id=bookmark9>‌</span>CHAPTER <span class=s3>10</span></p><p><br></p><p>Ninakawa Smiles</p><p><br></p><p>20 August 1974 am in Buddha Hall</p><p><br></p><p>JUST BEFORE NINAKAWA PASSED AWAY THE ZEN MASTER IKKYU VISITED HIM.
“SHALL I LEAD YOU ON?” IKKYU ASKED.</p><p><br></p><p>NINAKAWA REPLIED, “I CAME HERE ALONE, AND I GO ALONE. WHAT HELP COULD
YOU BE TO ME?”</p><p><br></p><p>IKKYU ANSWERED, “IF YOU THINK YOU REALLY COME AND GO, THAT IS YOUR
DELUSION. LET ME SHOW YOU THE PATH IN WHICH THERE IS NO COMING AND
GOING.”</p><p><br></p><p>WITH HIS WORDS, IKKYU HAD REVEALED THE PATH SO CLEARLY THAT NINAKAWA
SMILED AND PASSED AWAY.</p><p><br></p><p>Death is the crescendo, the highest peak that life can attain. In the
moment of death much is possible. If you have been preparing and
preparing, meditating and waiting, then at the moment of death
enlightenment is very easily possible – because death and enlightenment
are similar. A master, one who is enlightened, can easily make you
enlightened at the moment of death. Even before, whenever it happens,
you have to be ready to die.</p><p><br></p><p>What happens in death? Suddenly you are losing your body, suddenly
you are losing your mind. Suddenly you feel you are going away from
yourself – all that you believe to be yourself. It is painful, because
you feel you are going to be drowned into emptiness. You will be nowhere
now, because you were always identified with the body and the mind, and
you never knew the beyond; you never knew yourself beyond the body and
the mind. You got so fixed and obsessed with the periphery that the
center was completely forgotten.</p><p>In death you have to encounter this fact: that the body is going, now
it cannot be retained any more. The mind is leaving you – now you are no
more in control of the mind. The ego is dissolving – you cannot even say
‘I’. You tremble with fear, on the verge of nothingness. You will be no
more.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you have been preparing, if you have been meditating – and
preparation means if you have been making all efforts to use death, to
use this abyss of nothingness – rather than being pulled into it you
have been getting ready to jump into it, it makes a lot of difference.
If you are being pulled into it, grudgingly – you don’t want to go into
it and you have been snatched – then it is painful. Much anguish! And
the anguish is so intense that you will become unconscious in the moment
of death. Then you miss.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you are ready to jump there is no anguish. If you accept and
welcome it, and there is no complaint – rather, you are happy and
celebrating that the moment has come, and now I can jump out of this
body which is a limitation, can jump out of this body which is a
confinement, can jump out of this ego which has always been a suffering
– if you can welcome, then there is no need to become unconscious. If
you can become accepting, welcoming – what Buddhists call tathata, to
accept it, and not only to accept, because the word accept is not very
good, deep down some nonacceptance is hidden in it – no, if you welcome,
if it is such a celebration, an ecstasy, if it is a benediction, then
you need not become unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>If it is a benediction, you will become perfectly conscious in that
moment. Remember these two things: if you reject, if you say no, you
will become totally unconscious; if you accept, welcome, and say yes
with your full heart, you will become perfectly conscious. Yes to death
makes you perfectly conscious; no to death makes you perfectly
unconscious – and these are the two ways of dying.</p><p><br></p><p>A Buddha dies totally accepting. There is no resistance, no fight
between him and death. Death is divine; you die fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>If a man has been preparing, getting ready, at the moment of death
the master can be miraculously helpful. Just a word at the right moment
and the flame inside suddenly explodes, you become enlightened – because
the moment is such, so intense, you are so concentrated at one
point.</p><p><br></p><p>This is happening in this story. Ikkyu is one of the greatest
masters, a very rare, revolutionary, nonconformist. Once he stayed in a
temple. The night was very cold and there were three wooden Buddhas in
the temple, so he burned one Buddha to warm himself. The priest became
aware – he was fast asleep, it was in the middle of the night and the
night was very cold – he became aware that something was going on, so he
looked.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha was burning! – and this man Ikkyu was sitting, happy, warming
his hands. The priest became mad; he said, “What are you doing? Are you
a madman? – and I thought you to be a Buddhist monk, that’s why I
allowed you to stay in the temple. And you have done the most
sacrilegious act.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ikkyu looked at the priest and said, “But the buddha within me was
feeling very cold. So it was a question whether to sacrifice the living
Buddha to the wooden one, or to sacrifice the wooden one to the living
one. And I decided for life.”</p><p>But the priest was so mad with anger, he couldn’t listen to what
Ikkyu was saying. He said, “You are a madman. You simply get out of
here! You have burned Buddha.”</p><p>So Ikkyu started to poke the burned Buddha – ashes were there, the
statue was almost completely finished. He started to poke with a stick.
The priest asked, “What are you doing?”</p><p>He said, “I am trying to find the bones of Buddha.”</p><p><br></p><p>So the priest laughed, he said, “You are either a fool or a madman.
And you are absolutely mad! You cannot find bones there, because it is
just a wooden Buddha.”</p><p>Ikkyu laughed, he said, “Then bring the other two. The night is still
very cold and the morning is still far away.”</p><p>This Ikkyu was a very rare man. He was turned out immediately, out of
the temple. In the morning he was sitting just on the side of the street
outside the temple – worshipping a milestone, putting flowers, doing his
prayers. So the priest said, “You fool! In the night you misbehaved with
Buddha. What have you done? You have committed a sin, and now what are
you doing with this milestone? This is not a statue.”</p><p>Ikkyu said, “When you want to pray, everything is a statue. At that
time the buddha within was feeling very cold. At this time the buddha
within is feeling very prayerful.”</p><p>This man Ikkyu had thousands of disciples all over the country, and
he used to wander from one place to another to help disciples. This
story is about one of his disciples, Ninakawa. He was just on the verge,
almost enlightened. But ‘almost enlightened’ means nothing; you can move
back, from the last point also you can fall. Unless it has happened, it
has not happened. From the very last moment, when only one step remains
and you will become an enlightened one, you can come back. This Ninakawa
was almost enlightened but still in the grip of the scriptures, because
unless you reach to the truth, it is very difficult to get out of the
grip of the scriptures.</p><p>It is very difficult to get out of the prison of words. It happens
only when you are really enlightened. Then you can see that words are
just words: nothing is there, they are not substantial, they are made of
the stuff dreams are made of. They are just ripples in the mind, nothing
else; sounds in the mind. And the meaning? Meaning is given by us; it is
not there, no word is meaningful. And any word can become meaningful by
common agreement.</p><p>So it is just a social phenomenon, not concerned with truth at all.
But people live by words: if someone says something against Jesus and
you are a Christian you will be ready to kill him, or be ready to be
killed – it is a question of life and death. Someone says something
against Mohammed, a Mohammedan gets mad. Just a word – ‘Mohammed’ is
just a word, ‘Jesus’ is just a word – but people live by words.</p><p>I have heard: Once Mulla Nasruddin caught hold of a man on the street
and said, “I am in a very difficult situation: my wife is hungry, my
children are ill. Will you help me a little?”</p><p>The man looked at Nasruddin; he was really in a sad plight. He asked,
“Why should I help you? But one thing I would like to ask: what brought
you to this sad plight? How did you become so miserable? What has
happened to you?”</p><p>Nasruddin said, “It is a long story. But to say it in short: just a
few years ago I was also a businessman like you, and beggars used to
catch hold of me on the street. Everything was going wonderfully. Then a
catastrophe<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>The man became interested. He said, “Then what happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin said, “My business was very good, money was pouring
in continuously. I was a very industrious worker, totally absorbed in my
business. And I had a motto on my table: ‘Think constructively! Act
decisively!’ and money continued pouring in. And then...” Mulla
Nasruddin’s frame started convulsing and he said, “then my wife burned
the motto. That motto, ‘Think constructively! Act decisively!’ – the
whole thing depended on that motto. And my wife burned it! That was the
greatest catastrophe, and that has led me to this sad plight.”</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever thought, if your scriptures are burned, what will
happen to you? If your mottos are burned, what will happen to you? If
your words are burned, what will happen to you? You will be in a very
sad plight. That’s why, if someone says anything against the Bible, you
become mad. It is not because he is saying something against the Bible –
he is burning your motto. You depend on the word. And you depend on the
word because you don’t know what truth is. If you come to know what
truth is you will throw all the words, you will burn all the mottos.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin seems to be foolish – he is not. He is just a
representative human being, the most representative, the normal. He is
you, in all your absurdities – but magnified, of course.</p><p><br></p><p>This Ninakawa was struggling his whole life, meditating, sitting,
using many techniques, trying in every way to become calm and quiet and
still; but he was still in the grip of scripture. The day he was dying
Ikkyu visited him. That was the moment now to push this man into the
infinite abyss. He may miss, because at the time of death, if scripture
is there, you will miss.</p><p><br></p><p>You need to be totally vacant, you need to be totally empty; only
then can you meet death, because death is emptiness. And only the alike
can know the alike, the same can understand the same. If you are filled,
even with a single word, you will miss, because then the mind is there –
and death has no mind, death has no thought; death is simply falling
into emptiness.</p><p><br></p><p>So Ikkyu came to push this disciple at the last moment. He had been
missing his whole life – he should not miss this last moment. And I also
tell you: if you miss your whole life, then there is only one
possibility and only one hope – at the moment of death. But no need to
wait for it, it can happen right now. If it is not happening right now,
then go on trying. But get ready for death. If you are ready, I will be
there to push you. If you are ready, then it is very easy: just a little
jerk, and the mind blows.</p><p><br></p><p>JUST BEFORE NINAKAWA PASSED AWAY THE ZEN MASTER IKKYU VISITED
HIM.</p><p><br></p><p>Masters have been visiting always. It may not have actually happened,
remember that; it may not have actually happened. It may be, it is
possible, that nobody else than Ninakawa saw the master visiting him. It
may have actually happened, but that is irrelevant. One thing is
certain: that while Ninakawa was dying, just at the last moment the
master was there. This dialogue happened with Ninakawa and Ikkyu. There
may have been many others there, they may not have heard it at all; they
may not have seen Ikkyu coming at all. It was or it was not a physical
visit. But it happened, and it did.<span class=s4></span>whatsoever
was needed was done.</p><p>“SHALL I LEAD YOU ON?” IKKYU ASKED. NINAKAWA REPLIED...</p><p><br></p><p>A man of scripture, particularly Buddhist, because in Buddhism the
guru is not accepted. Buddha is the greatest guru, but in Buddhism the
guru is not accepted. They have a reason for it. Because the human mind
is so complex, it creates trouble everywhere: the guru is to liberate
you, but you can make a bondage out of him. Hindus have been teaching
that without the guru, without the master, there is no liberation. And
this is true, absolutely true, but by the time of Buddha it became a
bondage.</p><p><br></p><p>Without the guru, without the master, there is no liberation. So
people started becoming slaves of masters, because without them there is
no liberation. Look at the human mind and the stupidity: a master is to
liberate, but you can become a slave to the master because only he can
liberate; then you can become just docile. Much slavery was created;
nobody else on this earth has created such a deep slavery as Hindus. You
cannot come across a single revolution in the whole history of Hinduism
against the priest. No – the whole thing was so settled and so fixed and
systematized, and everybody was aware that if you rebel against the
priest there is no liberation – he is the guru, he is the master.</p><p><br></p><p>The untouchables – the sudras – have existed in the most miserable
condition. They are the greatest of slaves and they have the longest
history of slavery, but never have they revolted against it, because it
was not possible. The guru, the master, the brahmin – he is the door to
the divine. You have missed this life, and if you rebel you miss the
other also – so remain a slave.</p><p><br></p><p>Then came Buddha, and he said, “No need for the guru” – not because
there is no need for the guru: he said no need for the guru, and he
meant no need to become a slave – but that was the only way to say it.
So Buddha says, “Be a light unto yourself. Nobody is needed to lead you.
Nobody is needed to guide you. You are enough unto yourself.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the greatest possibility of being free, of freedom. But you
can misuse this also, this is the problem. Then you think that if there
is no need for a master, then why listen to the Buddha? If there is no
need for the master, then why go to the Buddha? If I am totally
independent, then I am Buddha myself. That happened through Buddhism:
slavery didn’t happen, but deep egoism happened. But both are the two
extremes: either you become an egoist – because no guru, no master,
nobody to follow – or you become a slave, because without the guru there
is no liberation.</p><p><br></p><p>Can’t you be in the middle? Can’t you just stand in the middle
without moving to the extreme? If you can be in the middle, the mind
disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>Ikkyu came, and he said, “Shall I lead you?”</p><p><br></p><p>Ikkyu asked the basic Buddhist question, and Ikkyu knows that if he
is still burdened with the scripture he will say, “No, who can lead
anybody? Nobody is a guru. Every soul is absolutely independent. I am a
light unto myself.” If he is burdened with the scripture, this will be
the response. If he is not burdened with the scripture, then the
response can be any – infinite possibilities open.</p><p><br></p><p>NINAKAWA REPLIED, “I CAME HERE ALONE...” This is what Buddha says
“... I GO ALONE. WHAT HELP COULD YOU BE TO ME?”</p><p>Everybody is born alone, goes alone; and in the middle of these two,
coming and going, you may delude yourself that you are with somebody,
but you still remain alone. Because if you are in the beginning alone
and in the end alone, how in the middle can you be with somebody? The
wife, the husband, the friend, the society, are all illusions. You
remain alone, aloneness is your nature. You can be deluded, that’s all.
You can have dreams, that’s all, but the other remains always the other
and there is no meeting point. This is the basic Buddhist teaching to
make man free.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why Buddha even denied God, because if there is God how can
you be alone? He is always there. Even when you are in your bathroom he
is there – because he is omnipotent, omnipresent. You cannot escape him;
wherever you go he will be there. He is the cosmic eye, the cosmic spy,
following you. Whatsoever you do, he will be looking! It is very
difficult to escape God; if he is, then he is everywhere. You cannot
hide – this is beautiful if you can understand – and religious people
used it to help.</p><p><br></p><p>Hindus, Mohammedans, Christians, they have all used the omnipresence
of God. It is a great help, because if you can really feel God following
you like a shadow everywhere, you will become very, very much alert and
aware – because he is there. You are not alone, you cannot relax into
sin, you cannot relax into ignorance, sleepiness – he is there. The
presence will make you alert.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the right use. But otherwise the presence can become a
bondage, a heavy burden, anxiety.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about a Christian nun who would not even take her bath
in the nude. No, she would continue to have her clothes on even under
the shower, so somebody asked, “What are you doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “How I can be naked? – because God is everywhere.” But if
God is everywhere – in the bathroom – he is inside the clothes also, you
cannot escape him. He is inside you. He is everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>This can become a deep anxiety, just like when you are taking your
bath, and you become aware that somebody is peeping through the keyhole
– you become anxious. And God is the cosmic Peeping Tom – he is sitting
at every keyhole; you cannot do anything without his knowing it; you
make love and he is there. Whatsoever you do he knows, and everything is
recorded.</p><p><br></p><p>This can become a deep anxiety, a neurosis; this can create guilt,
and then you have missed. And remember: every key that can open a door
can destroy the lock also if you use it wrongly. There is a way, a right
way to use a key; only then it opens the lock. If you use it wrongly,
the lock may be destroyed. And as the mind is, it always uses keys in a
wrong way. Then somebody is needed who must say to you, “Throw this key,
because this key is now useless. This is only destroying the lock, not
helping you in any way.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said no guru is needed – because in his time the guru meant
the brahmin. Krishnamurti is saying the same thing: no guru is needed.
But there is another possibility – it may give you freedom. If it gives
you freedom it is perfectly okay. But it may give you egoism and that’s
the problem, there is the rub. If it gives you egoism, you may not
become a slave to somebody else, but you have become a slave to your own
ego. And remember, nobody can be such a dangerous master as your ego can
be. Nobody can make you so blind as your ego can make you. Nobody can
lead you to such hells as your ego can lead you.</p><p>Ikkyu just wanted to know whether this man is still clinging to the
scriptures, or he has come to understand Buddha. Understanding is
different, clinging is different. Clinging is to the dead letter. If he
has understood, then Buddha is the greatest master. If he has not
understood, then he will not allow; even at the point of death, he will
cling to the scriptures.</p><p><br></p><p>Ikkyu was standing there, and was asking, “Can I lead you? Shall I
lead you on? ... Because the path is unknown. You have never been
through it, I have been along it. I know how to die, I know how to
celebrate death. I know how to lose yourself into death, and then you
never lose; then the real self is born for the first time. I know the
secret of dying and rebirth. Can I lead you on?”</p><p><br></p><p>NINAKAWA REPLIED – he refused – he said: “I CAME HERE ALONE, AND I GO
ALONE. WHAT HELP COULD YOU BE TO ME?”</p><p><br></p><p>And he was in need of help. If he was not in need of help he would
have simply laughed, smiled; he would have said, “Thank you.” There was
no need to use these words from the scriptures. Why do you use
scriptures? They are rationalizations. Whenever you are uncertain you
use the scripture, because the scripture is very certain. Whenever you
are in doubt, you use Buddha, Krishna, Christ, because they can hide
your hesitation, they can hide your reality, they can give you a false
confidence.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you are using others’ words you are hiding your ignorance.
This man was not saying, “I CAME HERE ALONE” – this was not his
experience. He was not saying “... AND I GO ALONE.” He was repeating
words, and you cannot deceive a master with words.</p><p><br></p><p>IKKYU ANSWERED, “IF YOU THINK YOU REALLY COME AND GO...”</p><p><br></p><p>These are the most beautiful words ever uttered – the essence of all
the Upanishads, the essence of all Buddhas and Mahaviras, just in one
sentence.</p><p><br></p><p>“IF YOU THINK YOU REALLY COME AND GO, THAT IS YOUR DELUSION. LET ME
SHOW YOU THE PATH ON WHICH THERE IS NO COMING AND NO GOING.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is really very difficult and subtle.</p><p><br></p><p>Says Ikkyu, “If you think you really come and go, then the ego is
there. Who comes? Who goes? If you think you come and go, you don’t
know; then you are simply repeating Buddha’s words” – there is the
catch.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have come to know that, “I come alone, and I go alone,” then
there is no coming and no going, because the soul is never born, never
dies. Life is an eternal continuum. It continues. It never comes, never
goes. This body may have been born, this body may die – but that life,
the energy, the self, the soul, or whatsoever you call the consciousness
that exists in this body, has never been born and will not die. That
consciousness is continuous. There has never been any break in it.</p><p><br></p><p>If you really know, then you know that there is no coming, no going.
Who comes? Who goes? If you don’t understand, if you have not realized
this, then you will say, “I come alone.” But then this ‘I’ is the ego;
then this ‘I’ is not the self. When you say, “I go alone,” the emphasis
is on ‘I’ – and the ‘I’ is</p><p>the bondage. If there is no ‘I’, suddenly you will see that you have
never been born, and are never going to die; then there is no beginning
and no end.</p><p><br></p><p>Says Jesus... somebody asked Jesus, “Are you the messiah we have been
waiting for? Who are you? Tell us about you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus said, “Before Abraham was, I am.”</p><p><br></p><p>Abraham must have been thousands of years before, and Jesus says,
“Before Abraham was, I am.” The sentence is really very absurd,
logically absurd, grammatically wrong: “Before Abraham was, I am.”
Abraham is in the past; Jesus says, “Before he was...” and Abraham is
the first prophet. There is every possibility that Abraham is just a
changed name of Ram, because in old Hebrew it is not Abraham, it is
Abram. And Ab simply means respect, just like Shree Ram; it is just to
pay respect. There is every possibility that Abraham is no one else than
Ram.</p><p><br></p><p>Says Jesus, “Before Abraham was, I am.” For Abraham he uses the past
tense: he has been and is no more; the manifestation was there and now
is no more. But “I am,” because “I am always: I was, I am here, I will
be.”</p><p><br></p><p>The innermost consciousness knows no birth, no death; knows no past,
no present, no future; knows no time. It is eternal, and eternity is not
part of time.</p><p><br></p><p>Said Ikkyu, “IF YOU THINK YOU REALLY COME AND GO – if you think that
there is a coming and going – YOU ARE IN DELUSION. LET ME SHOW YOU THE
PATH ON WHICH THERE IS NO COMING AND GOING.”</p><p><br></p><p>What have buddhas been doing? They have simply been show-ing you that
you are perfect – as you are. No change is needed. You have not to go
anywhere, you have not to move a single inch. As you are, you are in
your perfect glory, here and now. There is no coming and no going. Just
become aware of the phenomenon that you are. Just become aware who you
are! Just be alert! And then nothing is to be achieved, no effort is to
be made, because from the very beginning, before Abraham was, you are.
You have seen the creation of the world, you will see the end of the
world, but there is no beginning to you and no end to you.</p><p><br></p><p>You are the witness, and the witness cannot have any beginning and
cannot have any end. If you had been alert you would have seen your own
birth. If you can die consciously, you will see that death is happening
in the body and you are just an onlooker. So the body dies, and you are
just the witness. And if you can be a witness in the death, then in the
next life, in the birth, you will be a witness. You will see that the
mind is choosing a womb: hovering all around the earth, finding a woman,
a couple, making love – you will see it.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as if you are hungry: you go to the market, and you can be a
witness that your eyes, your mind is looking at the hotels, restaurants,
to find the right place where you can have your food. You are hungry,
but if you get too identified with the hunger then you cannot be a
witness. Otherwise, hunger is there, but you are not the hunger. How can
you be the hunger? – otherwise who will know that you are hungry?</p><p>Hunger, to be known, needs someone else beyond the hunger who can
look and see, who can become alert. If you can become alert in hunger,
then you can see how your mind is searching for a right place to have
your food. The same happens after death: your mind is in search of a
right womb. You choose, you see what is happening.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are in search of a particular womb, if you are a very good
soul or a very bad soul, then you may take many years to find a right
womb – very difficult. If you are just an ordinary person, just normal,
nothing special good or bad, neither a Hitler nor a Gandhi, then you can
be born immediately; there is no need, because everywhere ordinary,
normal, standard wombs are available. Then, this moment you die and the
next moment you are born – not even a single moment is lost.</p><p><br></p><p>But for a Hitler it may take many, many years – and it is good, we
are fortunate, because he is a very perverted soul, very perverted. You
cannot imagine his perversion, he perverted everything. And whenever a
man becomes perverted, the first thing to be perverted is his love,
because sex remains the root of your being. The first thing to be
perverted is sex. When sex goes wrong, everything goes wrong; when sex
is natural, everything remains natural.</p><p><br></p><p>Study Hitler’s sexual life and you will be simply amazed; you cannot
believe what he was doing. He would find beautiful women, but would
never make love to them. What would he do? You cannot imagine! He would
force those beautiful women... he would sit down and he would force them
that they should urinate on his head. What type of man...? What is he
doing? And he enjoyed it very much: not only urination, they should also
defecate on him. And the women felt very guilty – what is he doing? –
but he was such a powerful man: if you don’t follow him... he killed
many. All his beloveds were either killed by him or they committed
suicide – because this is such a perversion! But he felt very good. What
was the matter?</p><p><br></p><p>He was so guilty he wanted to punish himself; even through love he
was punishing. He was so guilty, and the guilt was so strong... if you
are so guilty you cannot love, because love can only come of the heart
of one who is not guilty, who doesn’t feel any guilt, who is just a
child, innocent. Then love flows, then it becomes a celebration. But if
you are guilty, then through love you start punishing yourself, or you
start punishing the other. You cannot enjoy love, because you feel you
are so guilty, so bad – how you can enjoy love? You create a hell out of
love. This seems impossible, because outside his room Hitler is almost a
god, people worship him. And inside his room he feels himself so
inferior, guilty, condemned, that he wants to punish himself, even
through love.</p><p><br></p><p>This type of man will not easily find a womb – almost impossible. For
centuries he will have to wait, only then he can find such a womb, such
a man and such a woman making love, who are so guilt-ridden, so
condemned in themselves, only then can he choose the womb. But this
happens unconsciously, so you need not worry much about it. You die
unconsciously, unconsciously you are born – it happens automatically.
The mind moves, just gropes in the dark and enters a womb. But if you
die consciously, then the next birth is going to be conscious.</p><p><br></p><p>If you die consciously and are born consciously you will know that
there is no birth and no death, only a body has been chosen. You remain
the same, only the house changes. If you change your old clothes, do you
say this is a new birth, I am born? No, because you have only changed
the clothes; you remain the same.</p><p>This is how one who becomes alert comes to know that all changes are
just changes of dresses and houses and places, situations,
circumstances, but you remain the same; the center never changes, it is
eternal.</p><p><br></p><p>Says Ikkyu, “IF YOU THINK YOU REALLY COME AND GO THAT IS YOUR
DELUSION. LET ME SHOW YOU THE PATH ON WHICH THERE IS NO COMING AND
GOING.”</p><p><br></p><p>What is that path? Is there really a path? Because we have to use
language, that’s why he says ‘path’. Otherwise there is no path, because
a path always leads somewhere. No path can lead to you because you are
already there. If you want to come to me there is a path, has to be. If
you come to somebody you have to follow a path, go through a passage, a
bridge, something or other – because you are moving outward. But if you
want to go inward there is no path. You are already there. A sudden jerk
is needed and you simply feel that you are there.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like when you dream in the night: you fall into sleep in
Poona, and in the dream you are back at your London home, or in New
York, or in Calcutta, or in Tokyo, and in the dream you completely
forget that you are in Poona. Then what is needed? Just a jerk. Somebody
comes and wakes you up. Will you wake up in London, Tokyo, New York, or
in Poona? It would have been very difficult, it will create a very
absurd world, if you are dreaming of New York and suddenly somebody
wakes you and you wake up in New York! Then this world would have been a
nightmare. But you wake up in Poona; the dream disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddhas have been teaching this: that there is no need to go
anywhere, because you are already there where you want to go; but you
are in a dream. Only in a dream have you moved from the center – you
cannot move from there. You are there. For millions of lives you may
have been dreaming, but you have not moved from the center where you
are. Nobody can move. Just a jerk, just somebody to shock you... you
become alert and suddenly the dream disappears. The dreamland and New
York and London, they disappear, and you are here and now.</p><p><br></p><p>This jerk, this shock can be given very easily at the moment of death
– because the whole body- mind is going through a great change.
Everything is in chaos. In a chaos you can be made alert more easily
because everything is uncomfortable. When everything is comfortable it
is difficult to bring a man out of the dream – nobody really wants to
come out of a comfortable dream. Only when the dream becomes a
nightmare, then you scream.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard: One night Mulla Nasruddin screamed so loudly that even
the neighbors came to ask what has happened. Mulla Nasruddin was sitting
on his bed weeping, tears flowing down, and his wife was consoling him,
saying, “It was just a dream Nasruddin. Why are you creating so much
nuisance? – the neighbors have come, there is a crowd.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin said, “But the dream was such... let me first tell you the
dream. In the dream I went to a wife auction – such beautiful women. One
woman fetched ten thousand rupees, another five thousand, and many for
thousands.</p><p><br></p><p>“I had no money. I tried and tried but there was no money. I looked
in all my pockets” – and he had one pocket, he would never look in it –
he said, “I even looked in that pocket.”</p><p>There was a special pocket he would never look in. And if something
was lost people would ask, “Have you looked in all the pockets? Why not
in this one?”</p><p><br></p><p>He would say, “Because that still gives me hope. If I look in that
pocket also, hope is gone, because I think there maybe still is a
possibility... but I never look in it because I know well it is not
there.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I looked even in that special pocket – and no money. I was
weeping and crying.”</p><p><br></p><p>But his wife was not interested in this. She asked, “Nasruddin, and
were there wives there like me also?” She asked foolishly, as any woman
will ask, because no woman is interested in other beautiful women;
rather, she felt jealous. She asked, “What about wives like me? How much
were they fetching?”</p><p><br></p><p>Nasruddin said, “That’s why I screamed. Wives like you those people
had put in bundles. One dozen, two dozen – they were selling wives like
you at one rupee a bunch. That’s why I screamed: no money to purchase,
and that was what was happening to my wife!”</p><p><br></p><p>But he was crying and weeping even out of the dream.</p><p><br></p><p>Dreams are effective, they go deep, because in an unconscious mind
the distinction is really very vague; what is dream and what is real is
very vague. They are mixed, the boundaries are not so clear-cut, the
boundaries are blurred.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you seen a child waking, and weeping because he has lost a toy
he saw in the dream? “I am looking around for the toy – where has the
toy disappeared to?”</p><p><br></p><p>But this child never dies in you. It dies only when you make much
effort to become alert; only then the dream and the reality become
clear-cut distinctions. And once the vagueness is lost, once the
boundaries are not blurred, once you become aware what is dream, what is
reality, the dream stops – because then the dream cannot continue. If
you have become aware the dream cannot continue. Even in a dream, if you
become aware that this is a dream, the dream will stop immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>So you never become aware in a dream that this is a dream, you always
feel this is real. For anything to continue, your feeling is needed that
this is real. You give reality through the feeling. If you withdraw the
feeling, the dream disappears and only the reality remains.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a dream that you are in this world, and it is the reality that
you exist in the divine. It is a dream that you are in the market; it is
the reality that you have never moved from the very center of existence,
from God. It is a dream you have moved in the market – and a dream can
continue, there is no time limit. If you think you are the body, this is
a dream – you have never been a body. If you think you are born and you
die, this is a dream – you have never been born and you can never die;
that is impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>Said Ikkyu, “This is your delusion if you say, ‘I come and I go.’
There is no one to come and no one to go. And there is no place to come
to and no place to go to. Let me show you the pathless path. Because
then there can be no path – because if there is no one to come and no
one to go, no place to come to and no place to go to, then how can the
path exist? So let me show you the pathless path on which there is no
coming and no going.”</p><p>WITH HIS WORDS, IKKYU HAD REVEALED THE PATH SO CLEARLY THAT NINAKAWA
SMILED AND PASSED AWAY.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened! You have heard the words – but you are not Ninakawa, you
are not that ready, you are not on your deathbed – that’s the problem.
You are still hoping for something in life, your dream still has much
meaning for you, you have investments in your dream. You may have a
desire to come out of the dream, but this desire is only half-hearted.
The other part goes on saying, “Dream it a little more, it is so
beautiful.”</p><p><br></p><p>One night Mulla Nasruddin called his wife and said, “Bring my specs,
because I have been seeing a beautiful dream and much more is promised
to me. Bring my specs, because the place is not so well lighted, and I
cannot see clearly.”</p><p><br></p><p>You may be having nightmares; in those moments you feel, “How to drop
out of the dream?” – but you have beautiful dreams also; not only
hellish dreams, you have heavenly dreams. And that’s the problem: unless
you become aware that even a heavenly dream is a dream and useless, you
are not on the deathbed. Your desire continues, you go on watering the
world of dreams, feeding it, helping it to grow.</p><p><br></p><p>Ninakawa was on his deathbed, he was dying, there was no future left.
He was in a chaos. The whole system, the whole adjustment of body, mind
and soul was getting looser and looser. Things were falling apart, he
was not together. The nightmare was intense, because it is most intense
in death. He was simply miserable in that moment: death and no
future.</p><p><br></p><p>If there is no future you cannot dream, because dreams need space,
time to move. That’s why death looks so dangerous, because it allows no
time to think. You cannot hope, because there is no tomorrow. Death does
not kill you, it simply kills the tomorrow, and tomorrow has been your
very existence. You have never lived today, you have been always
postponing for tomorrow. And death kills the tomorrow, it simply burns
your calendar – suddenly the clock stops, time doesn’t move.</p><p><br></p><p>Without time what can you do? How can the mind think, desire, dream?
Death closes the door – that is the fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Why does death make you so afraid and trembling and scared? Because
there seems to be no beyond, no possibility to escape from it. You
cannot do anything because you cannot think, and you know only one
thing: thinking, nothing else. Your whole life has been a thinking. Now,
death allows no thinking. Only a man who has been meditating and has
realized no-thinking before death will not be afraid – because he knows
that thinking is not life.</p><p><br></p><p>And he knows a different plenum of existence. He knows the depth, not
the length of existence. He is not moving from this moment to that, he
is not moving from today to tomorrow. He is moving in this moment,
deeper and deeper and deeper; in today, deeper and deeper and deeper. He
is moving here and now, in the depth.</p><p><br></p><p>You touch this moment and you move to another moment; you have a
horizontal movement: from A to B, from B to C, from C to D. And a man
who meditates goes on moving from A1 to A2 to A3 – in the depth – not to
B. He has no tomorrow. This here and now is the only existence, then
how</p><p>can there be death for him? This moment you are alive; only in the
next moment can you die. This moment no one has ever died. This moment
you are alive, and this man who meditates moves into this moment – how
can he die?</p><p><br></p><p>Death will happen on the periphery; he will come to know about it. It
will be just as you come to know about a neighbor who is dead: he will
come to know about it, that the body is dead – this will be news. He may
even feel sorry for the body, but he is not dying.</p><p><br></p><p>Ninakawa was a meditator just on the verge of enlightenment, still
clinging. You can take a jump into the abyss, but still you can cling to
a creeper – and you can go on clinging, afraid. You are almost in the
abyss, sooner or later you will fall, but still for a moment more the
mind says, “Cling!” He was clinging to the scriptures, to the buddhas,
to the words, the doctrines. He was still repeating knowledge. Just a
creeper – sooner or later he will have to leave this, because when life
leaves you, how can words be retained? They will leave you.</p><p><br></p><p>With this, Ikkyu’s revelation, he understood, he left the clinging.
He smiled and passed away.</p><p><br></p><p>You never smile. Either you weep or you laugh, but you never smile. A
smile is just in the middle, it is difficult for you. Either you weep or
you laugh – they are the possibilities, the two extremes. Try to find
out what this phenomenon of a smile is.</p><p><br></p><p>Only a buddha smiles, because it is just in the middle. A smile has
both a sadness in it, the sadness of the tears, and the happiness of
laughter. A smile has both. Smiling is never simple laughter: it has the
expansion of laughter and the depth of sadness – it is both. Look at
Buddha, meditate on him, and you will see in his face both a sadness and
a happiness; a blissful flowing of his being and still a deep
sadness.</p><p><br></p><p>With these two chemicals, so to say, a smile is created. When you
feel sad for everybody, when you feel sad for the whole existence
because they are unnecessarily suffering.<span class=s4></span>You
cannot imagine the</p><p>sadness of a buddha, it is difficult for you. You only think that a
buddha is happy. He is happy as far as he himself is concerned, but for
you? You cannot conceive his difficulty – because he sees you, and you
are unnecessarily suffering, and nothing can be done, you cannot be
helped. A disease that is not there – and incurable! And he knows that
just by the corner, just a turn of your being, and everything will be
solved. But you will not take that turn. You will jump and you will do
many things, but you will always miss that turn. You will grope in the
dark, but somehow, miraculously, you always miss the door. You know how
to miss the door, you are perfect in that: how to miss the door and
always go on groping.</p><p><br></p><p>A buddha is in difficulty because he has realized something which is
there with you already. The same blissful existence, the same beauty,
the same ecstasy that he has, you have. And you go on crying, and you go
on beating your chest, and you are in such a suffering – and nothing can
be done. A sadness...</p><p><br></p><p>It is said about Buddha that when he reached the door – the final
door beyond which there is no door, and you cannot come back; that is
the ultimate – when he reached the door of nirvana, the door was opened
for him and there was welcome. Because once in millions of years
somebody reaches to the ultimate. But he turned his back towards the
door and looked at the world – and they say he is still standing there,
he has not entered.</p><p>The doorkeeper asked, “What are you doing? You have been endeavoring
for this for many, many lives. Now the door is open, come in.”</p><p><br></p><p>And Buddha said, “Unless everybody who is suffering out there enters,
I cannot enter. I will be the last to enter.” This is the sadness.</p><p><br></p><p>The story is really beautiful. Nobody can stand at that ultimate
door, that’s true; there is no door like that and no doorkeeper. You
fall, and there is no way to stop yourself. The story is beautiful; that
shows in a symbolic way the consciousness of a buddha – the trouble, his
anguish, his suffering. It is not his suffering now, it is the suffering
of others that makes him sad.</p><p><br></p><p>It is as if you have awakened but everybody else is fast asleep, and
they are dreaming and dreaming nightmares – screaming, jumping, crying,
weeping, and you know that these are just nightmares, but these people
are so drunk and so fast asleep, you cannot help. If you try to wake
them up they become angry. They say, “Why are you disturbing our sleep?
Who are you?” You cannot wake them, and you have to see their suffering,
and suffer it.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha is sad – for you. Buddha laughs deeply, his whole being is
filled with laughter – just like a tree has come to flower, everything
has become a dance. And these both meet in him: the laughter that
bubbles and goes on coming out – and still he cannot laugh because of
you – and the sadness that you create. They both meet and the meeting
creates a smile. A smile is both laughter and tears.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot smile – you can laugh, you can weep. When you weep, how
can you laugh? Because in weeping it is always for yourself; it is a
single element. When you laugh, you laugh; how can you weep? – because
laughing is for yourself. In Buddha, the ego has disappeared, now he is
no more, the meeting has happened with the all. Two elements meet: his
consciousness which has become perfect, and all around millions of
consciousnesses which are perfect, suffering – unnecessarily suffering,
suffering without any cause – these two meet, and a sad and yet happy
smile comes to his face.</p><p><br></p><p>He cannot weep because what you are doing is so foolish. He cannot
laugh because that will be too hard on you. At the most he can smile.
This happened, so a smile has become a symbol of one who has become
enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>WITH HIS WORDS, IKKYU HAD REVEALED THE PATH SO CLEARLY THAT NINAKAWA
SMILED AND PASSED AWAY.</p><p><br></p><p>Then it was not a death, but just a passing – passing to another
world, a passing to another birth; then nobody was dying. And if you can
die with a smile you know the art of dying, and the whole of religion
consists in the art of dying, nothing else than that.</p><p><br></p><p>Now I will repeat the first story we started, so that you don’t
forget it: forgetfulness is a trick.</p><p><br></p><p>These ten days we have been talking about No Water, No Moon. It will
remain just a talk – words and words and words – if you are not ready to
die. Be on your deathbed! Be a Ninakawa! Then these words are so clear,
as Ikkyu’s never were. I tell you: these words are as clear as Ikkyu’s
never were. You can also smile and pass away – remember:</p><p>THE NUN CHIYONO STUDIED FOR YEARS, BUT WAS UNABLE TO FIND
ENLIGHTENMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>ONE NIGHT, SHE WAS CARRYING AN OLD PAIL FILLED WITH WATER. AS SHE WAS
WALKING ALONG, SHE WAS WATCHING THE FULL MOON REFLECTED IN THE PAIL OF
WATER.</p><p><br></p><p>SUDDENLY, THE BAMBOO STRIPS THAT HELD THE PAIL TOGETHER, BROKE, AND
THE PAIL FELL APART. THE WATER RUSHED OUT; THE MOON’S REFLECTION
DISAPPEARED – AND CHIYONO BECAME ENLIGHTENED.</p><p><br></p><p>AFTERWARDS, SHE WROTE THIS POEM:</p><p><br></p><p>THIS WAY AND THAT WAY,</p><p><br></p><p>I TRIED TO KEEP THE PAIL TOGETHER, HOPING THE WEAK BAMBOO</p><p>WOULD NEVER BREAK.</p><p><br></p><p>SUDDENLY THE BOTTOM FELL OUT. NO MORE WATER;</p><p>NO MORE REFLECTION OF THE FULL MOON IN THE WATER –</p><p>EMPTINESS IN MY HAND.</p><p><br></p><p>Go with emptiness in your hand, because that’s all... that’s all I
can offer to you, and nothing is greater than that. This is my gift: go
with emptiness in your hand. If you can carry emptiness in your hand,
then everything becomes possible. Don’t carry possessions, don’t carry
knowledge, don’t carry anything that fills the pot and becomes the
water, because then you will be seeing only the reflection. In wealth,
in possessions, in houses, in cars, in prestige, you will see only the
reflection of the full moon. And the full moon is there waiting for
you.</p><p><br></p><p>Let the bottom drop! Don’t try this way and that way to protect the
old pail. It is not worth it. Don’t protect yourself, it is not worth
it. Let the pail break down, let the water flow, let the moon in the
water disappear, because only then will you be able to raise your eyes
towards the real moon. It is always there in the sky – but emptiness in
the hand is needed. Remain more and more empty, think yourself more and
more empty, behave more and more as if you are empty. By and by, by and
by, you will have the taste of it. And once the taste comes, it is so
beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/nansen_the_point_of_departure/part10/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>10 My dance is complete</span>

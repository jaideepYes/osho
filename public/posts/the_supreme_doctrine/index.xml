Truth or Trick?
13 July 1973 pm in Mt Abu Meditation Camp

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
YOU SAID THAT TO LIVE MOMENT TO MOMENT ONE MUST THROW AWAY ONE’S DEAD PAST AND MEMORIES. DOES IT MEAN THAT ALL THE MEMORIES HAVE TO BE DISSOLVED AND DESTROYED TO TRANSCEND THE MIND? BUT ONE NEEDS A STRONG MIND AND AN INTENSE AND SUFFICIENT ACCUMULATION OF MEMORIES TO FUNCTION IN THIS WORLD.</description>

‌CHAPTER 12
The Great Circle of Brahman
14 July 1973 am in Mt Abu Meditation Camp
INVOCATION
THE STORY GOES THAT BRAHMAN OBTAINED A VICTORY FOR THE DEVAS. THOUGH THE VICTORY WAS DUE TO BRAHMAN, THE DEVAS BECAME ELATED BY IT AND THOUGHT: “THIS VICTORY IS DUE ONLY TO US; THIS GLORY BELONGS ONLY. TO US”
BRAHMAN CAME TO KNOW THIS, THEIR VANITY. HE VERILY APPEARED BEFORE THEM, BUT THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHO THAT YAKSHA – DEMI-GOD – WAS.</description>

Man Can Be Transcended
14 July 1973 pm in Mt Abu Meditation Camp

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IN THE WEST, PSYCHOANALYSIS HAS GROWN THROUGH FREUD, ADLER, JUNG AND WILHELM REICH, TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS ARISING FROM THE EGO SUCH AS FRUSTRATIONS, CONFLICTS, SCHIZOPHRENIA AND MADNESS. IN COMPARISON TO YOUR MEDITATION TECHNIQUES, PLEASE EXPLAIN THE CONTRIBUTIONS, LIMITATIONS AND INCOMPLETENESS OF THE SYSTEM OF PSYCHOANALYSIS IN SOLVING THE HUMAN PROBLEMS ROOTED IN THE EGO.</description>

‌CHAPTER 14
Knowing All Through the One
15 July 1973 am in Mt Abu Meditation Camp
INVOCATION
“THAT YAKSHA WAS BRAHMAN,” SAID UMA. “IT WAS THROUGH THE VICTORY OF BRAHMAN, INDEED, THAT YOU ACHIEVED THIS GLORY.” IT WAS FROM THAT – FROM THE WORDS OF UMA – THAT INDRA UNDERSTOOD THAT THE YAKSHA WAS BRAHMAN.
THEREFORE, VERILY, THESE GODS – AGNI, VAYU, AND INDRA – EXCEL ALL OTHER GODS, FOR THEY APPROACHED THE YAKSHA NEAREST; THEY WERE THE FIRST TO KNOW HIM AS BRAHMAN.</description>

Now You Can Go
15 July 1973 pm in Mt Abu Meditation Camp
The first question:
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
DO HINDU MYTHOLOGICAL GODS, LIKE SHIVA, UMA AND INDRA HAVE A REAL EXISTENCE ON SOME PLANE, OR ARE THEY JUST SYMBOLS AS YOU IMPLIED IN YOUR TALKS THE LAST TWO MORNINGS? AND IF THEY ARE REALLY ONLY SYMBOLIC, WHY DO PEOPLE SEE VISIONS OF THEM IN MEDITATION AND WHAT DO SUCH VISIONS OF GODS MEAN?</description>

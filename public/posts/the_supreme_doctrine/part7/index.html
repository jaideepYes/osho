BUT THE SADGURUS – THE SPIRITUAL MASTERS – HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WORSHIPPED BY THEIR DISCIPLES AS GOD. PLEASE EXPLAIN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS.\nThe masters have been worshipped as God, but this is only the beginning, not the end. The master is really a master if he makes his disciples ultimately free from all worship. But in the beginning it will not be so because in the beginning the relationship between the master and disciple is a love relationship, it is passionate. And whenever you are in love, the other appears to be divine.\nEven in ordinary love the beloved appears to be divine. And the relationship between a disciple and a master is a very deep love relationship. Really, you fall in love with the master and nothing is wrong in that. And when you fall in love with the master you start worshipping. But the master takes it only as a game. If he is also interested in it and takes it seriously or significantly, then he is not a master at all. To him it is just a game – but a good game, because it can help the disciple.\nHow will it help the disciple? The more the disciple worships the master, the nearer he will come to him, the more intimate he will become, the more he will be surrendered, receptive, passive. And the\nmore he is passive, receptive, surrendered, the more he can understand what the master is trying to do. And when the intimacy comes to the last point, when only an inch separates, when just a minute separation remains, when the intimacy has become so deep that now the master can lead the disciple toward himself, then the master can help the disciple to become free from him.\nIn the beginning it is impossible. You will not understand if the master starts trying to free you from himself – you will not be able to understand. In the beginning you need someone to lean upon, in the beginning you need someone to depend upon; in the beginning you need someone to whom you can be a total slave. This is an inner need. And you cannot be made a master from the very beginning; the beginning will be a sort of spiritual dependence.\nBut if the master also feels satisfied that you are depending on him, then he is not a master. He is harmful, he is dangerous; he doesn’t know anything at all. If he also feels gratified, then this dependence is mutual. You depend on him, he depends on you. And if the master depends on you in any way, he cannot be of any help. But if he rejects you from the very beginning there will be no intimacy. If there is no intimacy, the final step cannot be taken.\nWhen you trust your master so much that if he says, “Leave me,” you can leave him, only then will you be able to be freed. If you can trust your master so much that if the master says, “Kill me,” and you can kill him, only then will you be able to be freed – not before that. And this has to be brought about by and by. It is a long process. Sometimes the whole life, and sometimes many lives, the master goes on working with the disciple.\nThe disciple is not aware, he doesn’t know; he moves in darkness. The master is leading him toward the point where the disciple will not be a disciple but will become a master in his own right. When you have become a master, when this need to depend has completely disappeared, when you can exist alone, when you can be alone and there is no pain, no suffering, no anguish, when you can be alone and in ecstasy, only then are you free.\nReally, when a disciple happens to be near a master, the master appears to be God. For the disciple this is a fact because such love flows from the master, such high vibrations flow through the master. He becomes a source and just by his presence you are uplifted. Just by being in touch you are different. Just by being near him you vibrate in a different dimension altogether.\nSo if the master appears to be God it is a fact for the disciple and nothing is wrong in it. The master is God. It is only wrong when the disciple is not aware that he himself is also God. He is not wrong about the master, he is wrong about HIMSELF. And if the master says, “I am not God,” he is closing the very possibility to say to the disciple someday, “You are God also.” The master will not say it because this has to be revealed.\nEven if the disciple has come to feel that the master is God, it is a great step. Now the second step will be that the disciple has come to feel he himself is God. When the disciple has come to feel that he himself is God, then the whole existence will become godly. Then there is no need to even say that the master is God. It is irrelevant. The whole existence is God so what is the use of calling the master a god? But in the beginning it is significant.\nRemember, for the disciple truth has to be revealed in many steps; it cannot be revealed totally because you will not be capable of bearing it. You will not be capable of bearing it. It will be too\ndestructive. It has to be revealed slowly, part by part. Only that much can be revealed to you which you can absorb, which can become your blood, your bones, your heart, which will not prove destructive.\nHence, many things will be said later on. The master will go on saying things. The more you become capable, the more he will say. And when really you have become so capable that now you can be independent, the last thing the master will say is, “I am a bondage to you. Now leave this last fetter; now leave this last slavery.”\nWhen Zarathustra was going away from his disciples, moving to the hills to disappear forever, he said to his disciples, “Now the last message, and the last message is this: Beware of me; I am dangerous. You may become dependent on me and my whole effort is to make you independent. You may take my word as truth and my whole effort is to tell you that no word can be truth. Now beware of me.”\nThe last message of any real master will be, “Beware of me” – but this cannot be said in the beginning. So masters have allowed their disciples to worship them. They must have been laughing within because they know what game is going on. But the disciple is very serious; he thinks what he is doing is something very significant. But the master is just playing. It is just like when you are playing with your children, with their toys, and you also pretend to be serious: the master is really amidst children. They live on such different levels that if the master has to do something to be of any meaning he has to speak the language of the children. By and by he will drag the children toward a different world of a different language. This is going to be a long process.\nBut the Upanishads are saying the last; they are the essence of all religion. Really, they are not for the beginners, they are for those who have left the beginning far behind. Really, they are for those who have been struggling for a long time – meditating, searching, inquiring. Only then can the Upanishads be helpful. I am speaking on the Upanishads because you are meditating. Through your meditation you may have a glimpse which will make the Upanishads easy to understand. But if you are not meditating then the Upanishads will just pass over your head, they will not mean anything. Only with a meditative heart will you be able to make a contact with the message.\nThe message of the Upanishads is the most simple but the most supreme, the highest. The language used is very simple, the simplest possible, but the content – that which is said through that language – is the last word. It cannot be improved upon. Nothing can be said which the Upanishads have not said already. If even one Upanishad can be saved and all other religious scriptures are burnt, nothing will be lost because all the seeds are there. Sow these seeds and you can reap the whole human religiousness through them. But you will be able only if you are meditating deeply, moving side by side into the heart, the innermost center, and not simply making an intellectual effort to understand.\nSomeone has said that the Upanishad seems repetitive; it goes on saying the same thing about this sense and that sense – and again about eyes and about ears. Why does it go on repeating? Is there some significance in it? Yes, there is. It is because the master is speaking to children. Your memory cannot be depended upon so the truth has to be repeated constantly and still it is only a hope that it may be understood.\nBuddha goes on repeating the same thing again and again. The Upanishads go on repeating the same thing again and again. They are talking to children – to children who are not attentive. They may miss many times. It is hoped that sometimes their attention may be caught, so things have to be repeated. You are not alert, that is why; otherwise the ultimate can be expressed even in a single word. And that too is too much. It can be expressed through silence. Not even a single word is needed to express it. But then you will not understand silence.\nSomeone came to a Zen mystic, Rinzai, and he asked, “Tell me only that which is very essential, because I am in a hurry. I am a big official in the government and I have no time. I was just passing by your hermitage and I thought it would be good to go in and inquire. This has been on my mind for a long time. So tell me in essence, what do you think religion is basically, foundationally?”\nRinzai remained silent. The great official felt uneasy. He said, “Have you heard me or not? You seem to be deaf. I am asking you to give me a key word about religion.”\nRinzai said, “I have given it. Now you can go.” The official said, “But I have not heard.”\nRinzai said, “That which can be heard will not be essential. I have given you the key; silence is the key. Now you go. You are in a hurry.”\nBut now the officer started to be interested. This man looked interesting. He said, “Please elaborate a little more. It is too short, it is too condensed, it is too seedlike. A little elaboration will be helpful.”\nRinzai said, “But that will be a repetition because all that can be said I have said. Now you are forcing me to repeat.”\nThe officer said, “Let it be a repetition, but elaborate a little.”\nSo Rinzai said, “DHYANA – meditation.” It is again the same because meditation means silence. What else can it mean? Now it is a word. Before it was simple silence – that was more real. Now it is a word – meditation.\nThe man said, “It is still a little difficult for me. I am a worldly man. Explain it to me; it is still a puzzle.”\nRinzai said, “Now if I elaborate more, it will be false. The truth was given at first; now it is just a repetition in words. Already it has become half false, but now if I elaborate more it will be totally false. So do not force me to commit a sin. Now you can go. You are in a hurry.”\nThe Upanishads go on repeating FOR YOU because your attention is not reliable. Buddha had a very tedious way: he would repeat every sentence thrice – but only because of compassion. You may not have heard once, you may not have heard twice. The hope is that you may hear it the third time.\nJesus goes on using parables. I myself go on using parables, anecdotes, stories. Not that they are essential – they are a sheer wastage of time – but I use them just for you because children can\nunderstand stories better than anything else. It is hoped that if nothing is understood, at least the stories will be carried in the mind and just around the story some flavor of the real thing may also be carried unconsciously. But if you will not forget the story, if you can remember the story, then just by association something else may also be carried in remembrance. Jesus used so many parables because talking to children no other way is possible. Buddha goes on telling stories.…\nIt is because of you that the Upanishads repeat. There is no significance other than that. It can be said in a single sentence that senses will not lead to the ultimate but the Upanishads go on saying that sight will not lead to it, hearing will not lead to it, the hands will not lead to it.\nA single thing has to be repeated because of you and still you do not understand; that is the mystery. You hear it – and not only do you hear it, you feel that it is a repetition. But no understanding happens yet. Try to understand; do not try to analyze. Do not try to think about the mind of the rishi – why he is repeating. Think about your own mind, why it is repeating. And be alert so that rishis won’t need to repeat.\nI have heard, once it happened that one Zen priest gave his first sermon, and the next week he again repeated the same sermon and the third week also he repeated the same sermon word for word. The congregation became uneasy; it was too much. Religious sermons are by themselves boring but then he repeated the second time, he repeated the third time, exactly the same thing in exactly the same words. So the congregation thought that something had to be done.\nA spokesman was appointed. He went to the priest and said, “What is the matter? Do you have only one sermon to preach?”\nThe priest said, “No, I have quite a few.”\nThen the spokesman said, “Then why have you been repeating the same sermon three times? We are fed up with it.”\nThe priest said, “But you have not done anything about it yet. Unless you do something about it, I cannot go to the second. I have got quite a few but what have you done about the first? I have been preaching it three times – what have you done about it? You have not done anything. And unless you do something about the first, I cannot move to the second.”\nIt is said that the congregation, by and by, stopped coming. And it is said that the priest went on preaching the same sermon. Even to the vacant temple, when there was no one, he would preach the same sermon. Then people stopped coming that way because sometimes, just passing by the temple, they would hear the same sermon being taught. Then people started to feel afraid, scared of the man. They would not meet him in the street or anywhere. If they saw him they would just avoid him because he would stop and ask, “Have you done anything about the sermon?” He became like a haunting phenomenon around the village.\nThat is why the Upanishads go on repeating – because you have not done anything about the first thing. You have not done anything about the first, so they repeat a second time, a third time. There are one hundred and eight Upanishads. They do not say anything new; they go on repeating the same thing again and again. One Upanishad is repeated one hundred and eight times. But still, nothing has been done about it. You need more Upanishads.\nDo not think about the mind of the master. Think about your own mind. The second question:\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nYOU SAID THAT THROUGH CHAOTIC BREATHING YOU WANT TO DESTROY OUR OLD WRONG PATTERNS – TO REBUILD US IN A NEW DIMENSION. PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW THIS REBUILDING IN A NEW DIMENSION HAPPENS AFTER THE OLD HAS BEEN DESTROYED.\nYou have misunderstood me. The chaotic method is to destroy the old patterns, not to create a new one. It is NOT to create a pattern at all. Just the old pattern has to be destroyed. The method, all meditative methods, just destroy your conditioning without conditioning you in any way; otherwise there will simply be a change of fetters, a change of prisons. The new prison may look a little better but it is still a prison.\nThe unconditioned mind is the end – a mind which has no pattern around it. The old pattern has to be destroyed, and the new is not to be created because the new will become the old again. Nothing has to be created in its place; you are to be left alone without a pattern. But you have lived so long in patterns that you cannot conceive of how you can live without a pattern. How can you live without conditioning? How can you live without a discipline? How can you live without fetters? You have lived so long in slavery, in conditioning, that you cannot conceive of what freedom is. But you can live; really, only then will you live.\nA conditioned mind is not alive. For instance, people come to me and they say, “You do not give us any discipline: what to eat, what not to eat, what to do, what not to do. You simply give us meditation and let us go into chaos. You do not give us something to live by. You just push us into chaos without any discipline.”\nI do not give you any discipline because only those who are enemies to you can give you disciplines. I give you awareness, not discipline. And your awareness will give you spontaneous light about what to do and what not to do. And who can decide beforehand? And what is the need to decide it beforehand? When the moment arises, when the situation is there, you will be alert enough to do whatsoever happens to you – what is felt by your awareness itself to be done.\nIf you are aware you do not need any discipline. Only people who are fast asleep need discipline because they do not know what to do. They need a pattern to follow. Their whole life becomes a misery because no pattern can be helpful in a changing life. Every pattern will become a prison because life is constantly changing. This moment one act may be good but the next moment it may become bad because the situation has changed. And you go on following a dead pattern; you never fit anywhere.\nLook at your own lives: everyone is a misfit. Everyone is unfit; no one fits anywhere. And the reason? – the pattern, the discipline, the conditioning. You carry it everywhere. Whatsoever the situation, you have a constant pattern around you. You will never fit. Life is changing, life is a flux; it\nis riverlike, it is never the same again. Not for a single moment is life the same. It goes on changing and you have a fixed pattern which doesn’t change. You will be a misfit.\nEverywhere in the world, human beings have become misfits. And when you feel that you are a misfit, you feel discarded, rejected – as if life is against you. Quite the reverse is the case: your conditioning is against life. Only an unconditioned mind can respond to the changing life – because he has no pattern. Life creates a situation: he is alert; he behaves in a way which happens in that moment. That type of man will never regret; you will always regret. That type of man will never repent; you will always repent – whatsoever you do.\nYou love a girl: now the alternatives are whether to marry her or not. Whatsoever you do, you will repent. If you marry her, then for the whole of your life you will think the other alternative would have been better. If you do not marry, the same thing will happen: you will think that the other alternative was better. You have not been alert. Only an alert person can respond totally.\nYou can respond only in parts, fragments, and while you are responding it is a fragmentary response. And there are other parts within you which are against it. Sooner or later they will take revenge. They will say, “We were saying not to do this.” What does repentance mean? Repentance means you are divided. You do a thing and at that very moment something in you is against it. That part is watching you and that part is saying, “Do not do it! This is wrong.” And another part goes on saying, “This is right. Do it!” And you do it.\nYou will not fit because you can fit only when you are fluxlike, changing. A fixed entity cannot fit in a riverlike existence. You must be fluid. Only when you are liquid, fluid, flowing, changing, alert, aware, will you not repent. You will never feel guilty; you will never feel that something was better than what you did. Nothing can be better because you responded totally. That was all that could have been. Nothing else was possible.\nMy meditation technique is not to give you a new pattern; it is simply to drop the old pattern, to destroy it and leave you completely free without any imprisonment around you – without any prison. Of course, you will feel difficulty because the prison was also a shelter. Now there will be rains and there will be no shelter, and the wind will come and there will be no shelter, and the sun will be there, hot and burning, and there will be no shelter, and you would like to hide somewhere. Your eyes have become so accustomed to darkness that in the light you will feel uneasy. But this is what will make you free. You will have to get the feel of the new life under the open skies. Once you know the freedom and the beauty of it, once you have become aware, once you have come out of the prison, the old habit, you will not ask for any pattern or any discipline.\nAnd this doesn’t mean that your life will become a chaos – no! Your life will be the only ordered life possible. The life that you are leading is a chaos. It only seems to be ordered on the surface. Behind it, underneath, there is disorder and turmoil. Only on the surface have you created the appearance of order. Look within yourself: there is disorder. Ordered life will be disordered; disciplined life will be chaotic within. This looks paradoxical but this is so, this is the truth. Only an alert life will have an order – not forced but spontaneous, alive. The order will go on changing with life. It must.\nA spontaneous life is just like your eyes. Do you know that your eyes go on changing continuously? And when they stop changing, then you need some technical help. When I am looking at you and\nyou are ten feet away from me, my eyes have one kind of focus. When I start looking at the hills which are far away, my eyes immediately change. The lenses of the eyes change immediately. Then only can I see the hills. When I look at the moon, my eyes change immediately.\nYou come into the house, it is dark; your eyes change. You come out of the house, it is light; your eyes change. And when your eyes become fixed, they are ill. They must be fluxlike; only then are you capable of seeing. The more fluxlike the eyes, the more liquid they are, without any pattern, the more they are just changing with the situation, then the more alert your consciousness will be.\nMeditation will give you an inner eye which will be constantly changing, constantly aware of the new situation, constantly responding. But the response will come from your total being, not from a pattern. The response will come from YOU, not from a conditioning.\nNow, whatsoever you do, howsoever you react, it comes from your conditioning. If you have been born in a Jaina family, then just looking at nonvegetarian food you feel revolted, you feel a nausea. That nausea is not coming from you; that nausea is coming from the conditioning. It never comes to a Mohammedan; it never comes to a Christian. It is not that you are more nonviolent and they are violent: it is just a conditioning from the childhood. And that conditioning starts functioning the moment you see meat.\nEven the word meat and you will feel a subtle nausea. Just a word and the nausea will be felt. Is it coming from you? If it is coming from you, then your whole life will be a life of love. But it is not. You are as cruel as anybody else. The Jaina is as cruel as the Mohammedan and sometimes even more. He has to be more cruel because he cannot express his violence through food. It has to be expressed from somewhere else.\nWhen you eat, you express your violence. If you eat meat, your violence moves through food – it is released. This is a common observation: people who are nonvegetarians are more loving than the vegetarians – more loving, more kind than the vegetarians. Why? This should not be so. Their violence is released through food.\nIn your body, your teeth are the most violent part. Violent people eat more food than nonviolent people. Just crushing the food with the teeth gives release to violence, anger and hate. Persons who are eating meat and other such things have a natural outlet for their violence. I am not saying go and eat meat but if you do not eat meat, if you do not eat nonvegetarian foods simply by conditioning, do not think that you have become loving and nonviolent. Your violence will find other ways, more subtle ways. Your relationships will become more cruel, poisoned.\nBut if you are really not behaving according to a pattern; if this is because love has arisen in your heart; if you have become alert to the cruelty of eating animal food; if you have become alert by yourself; if not by any tradition, not by birth, not by any teaching, not by any scriptures, but by your own meditative experience you have become alert, if you have become alert that it is stupid, that to kill an animal for food is stupid, idiotic; if you have become alert of this fact by your own meditation – then it is totally different. Then your whole life will be nonviolent and loving. Then you will not just be obsessed with food but you will know it is an alive phenomenon and you will not be mad after any fixed rules. There will be no fixed rules, really; there will be only a constantly alive awareness.\nSo I am not going to create a new pattern for you. I am a destroyer. I am not going to create anything, really. I am just going to destroy, because there is no need to create. You are already there behind the structure. If the structure is destroyed, you will be freed. If the structure which binds you is no more there, you will be there. You are not to be created; you are already there. Only the walls of the prison have to be destroyed and you will be under the open sky.\nYou have misunderstood me. I told you this chaotic meditation is to destroy your conditioning, your slavery, your mind, your ego – in a deep sense, YOU. It has to destroy and then the new will be born. I am not saying I will create it. No one can create it. And there is no need: it is already the case. It is there. Only the shell has to be broken and it will come out.\nAll religion is destructive in this sense. The society is constructive, religion is destructive. Society constructs the conditioning. Society makes you a Hindu or a Christian or a Jaina. Society never allows you to be yourself. It gives you a pattern, because society is an organization. The society wants you to fit into that organization according to its own rules. The society doesn’t want YOU; the society only wants your efficiency. You are not the point, you are not the target. You must behave like a mechanical thing. The more mechanical you are, the more society will appreciate you because you will be less dangerous.\nNo machine can be dangerous. It never goes out of the way: it never disobeys, it never rebels, it is not revolutionary. No machine is revolutionary; it cannot be. All machines are orthodox: they obey, they follow. Society tries to change you into a mechanical thing. Then you are more efficient, less dangerous, reliable, responsible. And there is no fear, no danger; you can be relied upon.\nThe society creates a mechanical device around you: that is the conditioning. And it allows you only certain outlets and closes certain things completely. It chooses some fragments from you and approves them, then rejects all else. It says that only a part of you is good and the other parts are bad, so deny those parts. Society doesn’t accept you as a whole, as a unity; it accepts only certain parts. Hence, the conditioning.\nReligion is always destructive; in a way, religion is always antisocial. But society is very cunning. It tries to convert religion also into its managerial system. It wants to make religion also a part of it.\nJesus is rebellious, the church is not. Jesus is against society – he has to be, because he is trying to destroy the mechanical part and he is trying to free your spontaneity. He is bound to be against the society; the society will crucify him. But just by crucifying him you cannot destroy Jesus. Really, if you want to destroy Jesus, crucifixion will be of no help. You will have to organize a church around Jesus; only then will he be destroyed.\nIt is said that once it happened that the devil was very much disturbed because one man had achieved enlightenment on earth. He called his advisers and he asked them, “What to do now? One man has again achieved truth, he has become enlightened, and our whole profession is now in danger. What to do? How to prevent people from going to this man?”\nThe oldest follower of the devil said, “Do not be disturbed. We should go and we should organize a church around him. Do not worry. Then the church will become the prevention, then people will not be able to come to him directly. The church will be in between, and whatsoever he says will not\nbe heard by the people directly. The church will first interpret it, and through interpretation you can destroy anything.”\nTruth can be destroyed most easily if you order it, organize it. When religion becomes a sect, it becomes a part of society. Whenever religion is alive and not a sect, it is against society. Jesus is against society, Mahavira is against society, Buddha is against society. But Buddhism, Jainism, Christianity, they are all parts of society. They are religions no more. Religion has to be rebellious. And this is the rebellion: religion tries to destroy the mechanicalness because the mechanicalness is your hell. Spontaneity is your heaven; mechanicalness is your hell.\nI am not going to give you any new pattern – neither new nor old. I am simply going to destroy the pattern and leave you alone to live without a pattern. A life without a pattern is a religious life. A life without any forced order is a religious life. A life without any discipline, but with inner awareness, is a religious life.\nThe last question:\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHE KENOPANISHAD TOLD US IN THE BEGINNING THAT NOTHING IS TO BE DENIED AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE TOTAL ACCEPTANCE. BUT IN THE MORNING YOU SAID THAT PRAYER, IDOL WORSHIP, TEMPLES, CHURCHES, ARE ALL BASED ON FALSITIES – ON MENTAL PROJECTION. THIS SEEMS TO BE A DENIAL.\nIt is not. It is simply stating a fact. To say that a dream is a dream is not to deny it. To say that a projection is a projection is not to deny it. To say that a false thing is a false thing is just to state a fact. It is not to deny it. Total acceptance doesn’t mean that the falsity has to be stated as true, that the dream has to be called reality.\nTotal acceptance means that whatsoever is, is accepted. If the worshipper’s mind is projecting deities, divine beings, this has to be accepted. It is a fact that worshippers have been doing that. And you are not told to go and try to destroy their projections; you are not told to go and destroy their idols and their temples. If you understand, the very understanding will change you. You will not create those projections. And if you want to create them, then you will know that these are projections and you can enjoy them as such.\nIt is reported of Naropa, one of the greatest Tibetan mystics ever born.He was a very absurd\npersonality. I say “absurd” because he would do things no one would expect of a master. He was found in a pub drinking.\nSomeone said, “Naropa, what are you doing? You are enlightened, you have achieved the goal, and you are drinking?”\nNaropa said, “This is a game. And when it is a game, I do not care this way or that. Once I have come to know that I am the eternal within, why be afraid of this alcohol? Why be afraid?”\nI say “absurd personality” – but he is saying that this is alcohol and that whatsoever is created by alcohol is a dream. He is not saying this is reality; he is saying this is a dream. He said, “I am not obsessed for or against. It happened that a friend invited me and I didn’t want to say no. A friend invited me. For him this is real, for me this is a dream. But this is a dream for me, not for him. Why be bothered? It will be difficult for him.”\nI will tell you something else which will be nearer the point – less absurd.\nIt happened that Kabir’s family became very much disturbed. The family was poor and whosoever would come to Kabir’s house, Kabir would invite him for food. And at least two hundred people would come every day for his DARSHAN, to see him. And he would go on inviting everyone for food.\nThen his son Kamaal said one night, “Stop all this! We are poor. We have been begging, we have borrowed; now no one is going to give anything. What are you doing? You will reduce us to being thieves.”\nHe was very angry. But Kabir laughed and said, “Why didn’t you think of it before? Be a thief! This is a good idea!”\nBut Kamaal was also his son, Kabir’s son, so he looked at him: Kabir, a mystic, saying this – to be a thief? He must not be in his senses, or he does not understand what he is saying. But Kamaal said, “Okay, if you say so, then I will go. I will steal but you will have to come with me.” Kamaal was thinking that now Kabir would come to his senses. Kabir going to steal...?\nKabir stood up and said, “Okay, I am coming.”\nKamaal carried the whole thing to the very extreme. He was thinking that somewhere at the last moment Kabir would laugh and say, “I was just joking.” But no! Kamaal entered a house, pulled out some things from the owner’s treasure, brought them out, and Kabir was ready, waiting there. This was the last point; now there was no further possibility to change things. Now Kamaal asked, “What is to be done? Shall we take these things to the house?”\nKabir said, “Okay, but first you must go back, awaken the people of that house, and tell them.” Kamaal asked, “What way of stealing is this?”\nKabir said, “At least they should be told; otherwise they will be unnecessarily worried.”\nThose who follow Kabir have stopped narrating this story in their books because it is absurd. Kabir approving stealing? But what was the matter? In the morning Kamaal asked, “What is the matter now? Tell me the whole thing. You are in favor of stealing?”\nKabir said, “Everything belongs to God. No one else is the owner.”\nLook at this mind. For this mind everything is acceptable. There is total acceptance. Even stealing is accepted. But he says, “Go and tell the people so that they are not unnecessarily worried.”\nKamaal said to him, “But they will think we are thieves.”\nKabir said, “They are right. We are!”\nKamaal said, “But then the next day all your respect will go to the dust. No one will honor you.” Kabir said, “That’s right! Why should they honor thieves?”\nTotal acceptance means not denying anything. When you accept, you accept with conditions. You say, “Okay, I will do this if that is not going to happen. I can steal if God is not going to throw me into hell. I can steal if there is no sin in it. I can steal if people are not going to dishonor me for it.” What people will do has to be accepted also. TOTAL acceptance is the most alive way of life. But then everything is accepted; whatsoever happens as a consequence is accepted. There is no denial on any point. That is the last, the ultimate way of life. Really, that is what a sannyasin should be. What a sannyasin should have is total acceptance.\nBut when we say that you can create dreams, we are not denying; we are simply stating a fact. If you like, you can create dreams. I can help you to create them easily. But remember, they are only dreams.\nThe problem arises when dream becomes a reality. You can play with your Krishna, you can dance with him; nothing is wrong with it. Dance in itself is so good. What is wrong about it? You are not doing any harm to anyone playing with your Krishna, dancing. Dance and play! It will be good for you. But remember that this is not real. It is a projected thing; you have created it.\nIf you can remember this, you will play the game but you will never be identified with it. You will go on being aware that this is a game. A game is a game if you are not identified. If you are identified, it has become serious, it has become a problem. Now you will be obsessed.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6735","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_supreme_doctrine/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_supreme_doctrine/>The Supreme Doctrine</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">7 Meditation and the Inner Eye</h1><div class=post-meta>32 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6735 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Supreme_Doctrine/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

THE WORSHIPPED, BUT IN THE WORSHIPPER HIMSELF. BUT THE SADGURUS – THE
SPIRITUAL MASTERS – HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WORSHIPPED BY THEIR DISCIPLES AS
GOD. PLEASE EXPLAIN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS.</p><p><br></p><p>The masters have been worshipped as God, but this is only the
beginning, not the end. The master is really a master if he makes his
disciples ultimately free from all worship. But in the beginning it will
not be so because in the beginning the relationship between the master
and disciple is a love relationship, it is passionate. And whenever you
are in love, the other appears to be divine.</p><p><br></p><p>Even in ordinary love the beloved appears to be divine. And the
relationship between a disciple and a master is a very deep love
relationship. Really, you fall in love with the master and nothing is
wrong in that. And when you fall in love with the master you start
worshipping. But the master takes it only as a game. If he is also
interested in it and takes it seriously or significantly, then he is not
a master at all. To him it is just a game – but a good game, because it
can help the disciple.</p><p><br></p><p>How will it help the disciple? The more the disciple worships the
master, the nearer he will come to him, the more intimate he will
become, the more he will be surrendered, receptive, passive. And the</p><p>more he is passive, receptive, surrendered, the more he can
understand what the master is trying to do. And when the intimacy comes
to the last point, when only an inch separates, when just a minute
separation remains, when the intimacy has become so deep that now the
master can lead the disciple toward himself, then the master can help
the disciple to become free from him.</p><p><br></p><p>In the beginning it is impossible. You will not understand if the
master starts trying to free you from himself – you will not be able to
understand. In the beginning you need someone to lean upon, in the
beginning you need someone to depend upon; in the beginning you need
someone to whom you can be a total slave. This is an inner need. And you
cannot be made a master from the very beginning; the beginning will be a
sort of spiritual dependence.</p><p><br></p><p>But if the master also feels satisfied that you are depending on him,
then he is not a master. He is harmful, he is dangerous; he doesn’t know
anything at all. If he also feels gratified, then this dependence is
mutual. You depend on him, he depends on you. And if the master depends
on you in any way, he cannot be of any help. But if he rejects you from
the very beginning there will be no intimacy. If there is no intimacy,
the final step cannot be taken.</p><p><br></p><p>When you trust your master so much that if he says, “Leave me,” you
can leave him, only then will you be able to be freed. If you can trust
your master so much that if the master says, “Kill me,” and you can kill
him, only then will you be able to be freed – not before that. And this
has to be brought about by and by. It is a long process. Sometimes the
whole life, and sometimes many lives, the master goes on working with
the disciple.</p><p><br></p><p>The disciple is not aware, he doesn’t know; he moves in darkness. The
master is leading him toward the point where the disciple will not be a
disciple but will become a master in his own right. When you have become
a master, when this need to depend has completely disappeared, when you
can exist alone, when you can be alone and there is no pain, no
suffering, no anguish, when you can be alone and in ecstasy, only then
are you free.</p><p><br></p><p>Really, when a disciple happens to be near a master, the master
appears to be God. For the disciple this is a fact because such love
flows from the master, such high vibrations flow through the master. He
becomes a source and just by his presence you are uplifted. Just by
being in touch you are different. Just by being near him you vibrate in
a different dimension altogether.</p><p><br></p><p>So if the master appears to be God it is a fact for the disciple and
nothing is wrong in it. The master is God. It is only wrong when the
disciple is not aware that he himself is also God. He is not wrong about
the master, he is wrong about HIMSELF. And if the master says, “I am not
God,” he is closing the very possibility to say to the disciple someday,
“You are God also.” The master will not say it because this has to be
revealed.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if the disciple has come to feel that the master is God, it is a
great step. Now the second step will be that the disciple has come to
feel he himself is God. When the disciple has come to feel that he
himself is God, then the whole existence will become godly. Then there
is no need to even say that the master is God. It is irrelevant. The
whole existence is God so what is the use of calling the master a god?
But in the beginning it is significant.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, for the disciple truth has to be revealed in many steps; it
cannot be revealed totally because you will not be capable of bearing
it. You will not be capable of bearing it. It will be too</p><p>destructive. It has to be revealed slowly, part by part. Only that
much can be revealed to you which you can absorb, which can become your
blood, your bones, your heart, which will not prove destructive.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, many things will be said later on. The master will go on
saying things. The more you become capable, the more he will say. And
when really you have become so capable that now you can be independent,
the last thing the master will say is, “I am a bondage to you. Now leave
this last fetter; now leave this last slavery.”</p><p><br></p><p>When Zarathustra was going away from his disciples, moving to the
hills to disappear forever, he said to his disciples, “Now the last
message, and the last message is this: Beware of me; I am dangerous. You
may become dependent on me and my whole effort is to make you
independent. You may take my word as truth and my whole effort is to
tell you that no word can be truth. Now beware of me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The last message of any real master will be, “Beware of me” – but
this cannot be said in the beginning. So masters have allowed their
disciples to worship them. They must have been laughing within because
they know what game is going on. But the disciple is very serious; he
thinks what he is doing is something very significant. But the master is
just playing. It is just like when you are playing with your children,
with their toys, and you also pretend to be serious: the master is
really amidst children. They live on such different levels that if the
master has to do something to be of any meaning he has to speak the
language of the children. By and by he will drag the children toward a
different world of a different language. This is going to be a long
process.</p><p><br></p><p>But the Upanishads are saying the last; they are the essence of all
religion. Really, they are not for the beginners, they are for those who
have left the beginning far behind. Really, they are for those who have
been struggling for a long time – meditating, searching, inquiring. Only
then can the Upanishads be helpful. I am speaking on the Upanishads
because you are meditating. Through your meditation you may have a
glimpse which will make the Upanishads easy to understand. But if you
are not meditating then the Upanishads will just pass over your head,
they will not mean anything. Only with a meditative heart will you be
able to make a contact with the message.</p><p><br></p><p>The message of the Upanishads is the most simple but the most
supreme, the highest. The language used is very simple, the simplest
possible, but the content – that which is said through that language –
is the last word. It cannot be improved upon. Nothing can be said which
the Upanishads have not said already. If even one Upanishad can be saved
and all other religious scriptures are burnt, nothing will be lost
because all the seeds are there. Sow these seeds and you can reap the
whole human religiousness through them. But you will be able only if you
are meditating deeply, moving side by side into the heart, the innermost
center, and not simply making an intellectual effort to understand.</p><p><br></p><p>Someone has said that the Upanishad seems repetitive; it goes on
saying the same thing about this sense and that sense – and again about
eyes and about ears. Why does it go on repeating? Is there some
significance in it? Yes, there is. It is because the master is speaking
to children. Your memory cannot be depended upon so the truth has to be
repeated constantly and still it is only a hope that it may be
understood.</p><p>Buddha goes on repeating the same thing again and again. The
Upanishads go on repeating the same thing again and again. They are
talking to children – to children who are not attentive. They may miss
many times. It is hoped that sometimes their attention may be caught, so
things have to be repeated. You are not alert, that is why; otherwise
the ultimate can be expressed even in a single word. And that too is too
much. It can be expressed through silence. Not even a single word is
needed to express it. But then you will not understand silence.</p><p><br></p><p>Someone came to a Zen mystic, Rinzai, and he asked, “Tell me only
that which is very essential, because I am in a hurry. I am a big
official in the government and I have no time. I was just passing by
your hermitage and I thought it would be good to go in and inquire. This
has been on my mind for a long time. So tell me in essence, what do you
think religion is basically, foundationally?”</p><p><br></p><p>Rinzai remained silent. The great official felt uneasy. He said,
“Have you heard me or not? You seem to be deaf. I am asking you to give
me a key word about religion.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rinzai said, “I have given it. Now you can go.” The official said,
“But I have not heard.”</p><p>Rinzai said, “That which can be heard will not be essential. I have
given you the key; silence is the key. Now you go. You are in a
hurry.”</p><p><br></p><p>But now the officer started to be interested. This man looked
interesting. He said, “Please elaborate a little more. It is too short,
it is too condensed, it is too seedlike. A little elaboration will be
helpful.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rinzai said, “But that will be a repetition because all that can be
said I have said. Now you are forcing me to repeat.”</p><p><br></p><p>The officer said, “Let it be a repetition, but elaborate a
little.”</p><p><br></p><p>So Rinzai said, “DHYANA – meditation.” It is again the same because
meditation means silence. What else can it mean? Now it is a word.
Before it was simple silence – that was more real. Now it is a word –
meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “It is still a little difficult for me. I am a worldly
man. Explain it to me; it is still a puzzle.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rinzai said, “Now if I elaborate more, it will be false. The truth
was given at first; now it is just a repetition in words. Already it has
become half false, but now if I elaborate more it will be totally false.
So do not force me to commit a sin. Now you can go. You are in a
hurry.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Upanishads go on repeating FOR YOU because your attention is not
reliable. Buddha had a very tedious way: he would repeat every sentence
thrice – but only because of compassion. You may not have heard once,
you may not have heard twice. The hope is that you may hear it the third
time.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus goes on using parables. I myself go on using parables,
anecdotes, stories. Not that they are essential – they are a sheer
wastage of time – but I use them just for you because children can</p><p>understand stories better than anything else. It is hoped that if
nothing is understood, at least the stories will be carried in the mind
and just around the story some flavor of the real thing may also be
carried unconsciously. But if you will not forget the story, if you can
remember the story, then just by association something else may also be
carried in remembrance. Jesus used so many parables because talking to
children no other way is possible. Buddha goes on telling stories.…</p><p><br></p><p>It is because of you that the Upanishads repeat. There is no
significance other than that. It can be said in a single sentence that
senses will not lead to the ultimate but the Upanishads go on saying
that sight will not lead to it, hearing will not lead to it, the hands
will not lead to it.</p><p><br></p><p>A single thing has to be repeated because of you and still you do not
understand; that is the mystery. You hear it – and not only do you hear
it, you feel that it is a repetition. But no understanding happens yet.
Try to understand; do not try to analyze. Do not try to think about the
mind of the rishi – why he is repeating. Think about your own mind, why
it is repeating. And be alert so that rishis won’t need to repeat.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard, once it happened that one Zen priest gave his first
sermon, and the next week he again repeated the same sermon and the
third week also he repeated the same sermon word for word. The
congregation became uneasy; it was too much. Religious sermons are by
themselves boring but then he repeated the second time, he repeated the
third time, exactly the same thing in exactly the same words. So the
congregation thought that something had to be done.</p><p><br></p><p>A spokesman was appointed. He went to the priest and said, “What is
the matter? Do you have only one sermon to preach?”</p><p><br></p><p>The priest said, “No, I have quite a few.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then the spokesman said, “Then why have you been repeating the same
sermon three times? We are fed up with it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The priest said, “But you have not done anything about it yet. Unless
you do something about it, I cannot go to the second. I have got quite a
few but what have you done about the first? I have been preaching it
three times – what have you done about it? You have not done anything.
And unless you do something about the first, I cannot move to the
second.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that the congregation, by and by, stopped coming. And it
is said that the priest went on preaching the same sermon. Even to the
vacant temple, when there was no one, he would preach the same sermon.
Then people stopped coming that way because sometimes, just passing by
the temple, they would hear the same sermon being taught. Then people
started to feel afraid, scared of the man. They would not meet him in
the street or anywhere. If they saw him they would just avoid him
because he would stop and ask, “Have you done anything about the
sermon?” He became like a haunting phenomenon around the village.</p><p><br></p><p>That is why the Upanishads go on repeating – because you have not
done anything about the first thing. You have not done anything about
the first, so they repeat a second time, a third time. There are one
hundred and eight Upanishads. They do not say anything new; they go on
repeating the same thing again and again. One Upanishad is repeated one
hundred and eight times. But still, nothing has been done about it. You
need more Upanishads.</p><p>Do not think about the mind of the master. Think about your own mind.
The second question:</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YOU SAID THAT THROUGH CHAOTIC BREATHING YOU WANT TO DESTROY OUR OLD
WRONG PATTERNS – TO REBUILD US IN A NEW DIMENSION. PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW
THIS REBUILDING IN A NEW DIMENSION HAPPENS AFTER THE OLD HAS BEEN
DESTROYED.</p><p><br></p><p>You have misunderstood me. The chaotic method is to destroy the old
patterns, not to create a new one. It is NOT to create a pattern at all.
Just the old pattern has to be destroyed. The method, all meditative
methods, just destroy your conditioning without conditioning you in any
way; otherwise there will simply be a change of fetters, a change of
prisons. The new prison may look a little better but it is still a
prison.</p><p><br></p><p>The unconditioned mind is the end – a mind which has no pattern
around it. The old pattern has to be destroyed, and the new is not to be
created because the new will become the old again. Nothing has to be
created in its place; you are to be left alone without a pattern. But
you have lived so long in patterns that you cannot conceive of how you
can live without a pattern. How can you live without conditioning? How
can you live without a discipline? How can you live without fetters? You
have lived so long in slavery, in conditioning, that you cannot conceive
of what freedom is. But you can live; really, only then will you
live.</p><p><br></p><p>A conditioned mind is not alive. For instance, people come to me and
they say, “You do not give us any discipline: what to eat, what not to
eat, what to do, what not to do. You simply give us meditation and let
us go into chaos. You do not give us something to live by. You just push
us into chaos without any discipline.”</p><p><br></p><p>I do not give you any discipline because only those who are enemies
to you can give you disciplines. I give you awareness, not discipline.
And your awareness will give you spontaneous light about what to do and
what not to do. And who can decide beforehand? And what is the need to
decide it beforehand? When the moment arises, when the situation is
there, you will be alert enough to do whatsoever happens to you – what
is felt by your awareness itself to be done.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are aware you do not need any discipline. Only people who are
fast asleep need discipline because they do not know what to do. They
need a pattern to follow. Their whole life becomes a misery because no
pattern can be helpful in a changing life. Every pattern will become a
prison because life is constantly changing. This moment one act may be
good but the next moment it may become bad because the situation has
changed. And you go on following a dead pattern; you never fit
anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at your own lives: everyone is a misfit. Everyone is unfit; no
one fits anywhere. And the reason? – the pattern, the discipline, the
conditioning. You carry it everywhere. Whatsoever the situation, you
have a constant pattern around you. You will never fit. Life is
changing, life is a flux; it</p><p>is riverlike, it is never the same again. Not for a single moment is
life the same. It goes on changing and you have a fixed pattern which
doesn’t change. You will be a misfit.</p><p><br></p><p>Everywhere in the world, human beings have become misfits. And when
you feel that you are a misfit, you feel discarded, rejected – as if
life is against you. Quite the reverse is the case: your conditioning is
against life. Only an unconditioned mind can respond to the changing
life – because he has no pattern. Life creates a situation: he is alert;
he behaves in a way which happens in that moment. That type of man will
never regret; you will always regret. That type of man will never
repent; you will always repent – whatsoever you do.</p><p><br></p><p>You love a girl: now the alternatives are whether to marry her or
not. Whatsoever you do, you will repent. If you marry her, then for the
whole of your life you will think the other alternative would have been
better. If you do not marry, the same thing will happen: you will think
that the other alternative was better. You have not been alert. Only an
alert person can respond totally.</p><p><br></p><p>You can respond only in parts, fragments, and while you are
responding it is a fragmentary response. And there are other parts
within you which are against it. Sooner or later they will take revenge.
They will say, “We were saying not to do this.” What does repentance
mean? Repentance means you are divided. You do a thing and at that very
moment something in you is against it. That part is watching you and
that part is saying, “Do not do it! This is wrong.” And another part
goes on saying, “This is right. Do it!” And you do it.</p><p><br></p><p>You will not fit because you can fit only when you are fluxlike,
changing. A fixed entity cannot fit in a riverlike existence. You must
be fluid. Only when you are liquid, fluid, flowing, changing, alert,
aware, will you not repent. You will never feel guilty; you will never
feel that something was better than what you did. Nothing can be better
because you responded totally. That was all that could have been.
Nothing else was possible.</p><p><br></p><p>My meditation technique is not to give you a new pattern; it is
simply to drop the old pattern, to destroy it and leave you completely
free without any imprisonment around you – without any prison. Of
course, you will feel difficulty because the prison was also a shelter.
Now there will be rains and there will be no shelter, and the wind will
come and there will be no shelter, and the sun will be there, hot and
burning, and there will be no shelter, and you would like to hide
somewhere. Your eyes have become so accustomed to darkness that in the
light you will feel uneasy. But this is what will make you free. You
will have to get the feel of the new life under the open skies. Once you
know the freedom and the beauty of it, once you have become aware, once
you have come out of the prison, the old habit, you will not ask for any
pattern or any discipline.</p><p><br></p><p>And this doesn’t mean that your life will become a chaos – no! Your
life will be the only ordered life possible. The life that you are
leading is a chaos. It only seems to be ordered on the surface. Behind
it, underneath, there is disorder and turmoil. Only on the surface have
you created the appearance of order. Look within yourself: there is
disorder. Ordered life will be disordered; disciplined life will be
chaotic within. This looks paradoxical but this is so, this is the
truth. Only an alert life will have an order – not forced but
spontaneous, alive. The order will go on changing with life. It
must.</p><p><br></p><p>A spontaneous life is just like your eyes. Do you know that your eyes
go on changing continuously? And when they stop changing, then you need
some technical help. When I am looking at you and</p><p>you are ten feet away from me, my eyes have one kind of focus. When I
start looking at the hills which are far away, my eyes immediately
change. The lenses of the eyes change immediately. Then only can I see
the hills. When I look at the moon, my eyes change immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>You come into the house, it is dark; your eyes change. You come out
of the house, it is light; your eyes change. And when your eyes become
fixed, they are ill. They must be fluxlike; only then are you capable of
seeing. The more fluxlike the eyes, the more liquid they are, without
any pattern, the more they are just changing with the situation, then
the more alert your consciousness will be.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation will give you an inner eye which will be constantly
changing, constantly aware of the new situation, constantly responding.
But the response will come from your total being, not from a pattern.
The response will come from YOU, not from a conditioning.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, whatsoever you do, howsoever you react, it comes from your
conditioning. If you have been born in a Jaina family, then just looking
at nonvegetarian food you feel revolted, you feel a nausea. That nausea
is not coming from you; that nausea is coming from the conditioning. It
never comes to a Mohammedan; it never comes to a Christian. It is not
that you are more nonviolent and they are violent: it is just a
conditioning from the childhood. And that conditioning starts
functioning the moment you see meat.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the word meat and you will feel a subtle nausea. Just a word and
the nausea will be felt. Is it coming from you? If it is coming from
you, then your whole life will be a life of love. But it is not. You are
as cruel as anybody else. The Jaina is as cruel as the Mohammedan and
sometimes even more. He has to be more cruel because he cannot express
his violence through food. It has to be expressed from somewhere
else.</p><p><br></p><p>When you eat, you express your violence. If you eat meat, your
violence moves through food – it is released. This is a common
observation: people who are nonvegetarians are more loving than the
vegetarians – more loving, more kind than the vegetarians. Why? This
should not be so. Their violence is released through food.</p><p><br></p><p>In your body, your teeth are the most violent part. Violent people
eat more food than nonviolent people. Just crushing the food with the
teeth gives release to violence, anger and hate. Persons who are eating
meat and other such things have a natural outlet for their violence. I
am not saying go and eat meat but if you do not eat meat, if you do not
eat nonvegetarian foods simply by conditioning, do not think that you
have become loving and nonviolent. Your violence will find other ways,
more subtle ways. Your relationships will become more cruel,
poisoned.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you are really not behaving according to a pattern; if this is
because love has arisen in your heart; if you have become alert to the
cruelty of eating animal food; if you have become alert by yourself; if
not by any tradition, not by birth, not by any teaching, not by any
scriptures, but by your own meditative experience you have become alert,
if you have become alert that it is stupid, that to kill an animal for
food is stupid, idiotic; if you have become alert of this fact by your
own meditation – then it is totally different. Then your whole life will
be nonviolent and loving. Then you will not just be obsessed with food
but you will know it is an alive phenomenon and you will not be mad
after any fixed rules. There will be no fixed rules, really; there will
be only a constantly alive awareness.</p><p>So I am not going to create a new pattern for you. I am a destroyer.
I am not going to create anything, really. I am just going to destroy,
because there is no need to create. You are already there behind the
structure. If the structure is destroyed, you will be freed. If the
structure which binds you is no more there, you will be there. You are
not to be created; you are already there. Only the walls of the prison
have to be destroyed and you will be under the open sky.</p><p><br></p><p>You have misunderstood me. I told you this chaotic meditation is to
destroy your conditioning, your slavery, your mind, your ego – in a deep
sense, YOU. It has to destroy and then the new will be born. I am not
saying I will create it. No one can create it. And there is no need: it
is already the case. It is there. Only the shell has to be broken and it
will come out.</p><p><br></p><p>All religion is destructive in this sense. The society is
constructive, religion is destructive. Society constructs the
conditioning. Society makes you a Hindu or a Christian or a Jaina.
Society never allows you to be yourself. It gives you a pattern, because
society is an organization. The society wants you to fit into that
organization according to its own rules. The society doesn’t want YOU;
the society only wants your efficiency. You are not the point, you are
not the target. You must behave like a mechanical thing. The more
mechanical you are, the more society will appreciate you because you
will be less dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>No machine can be dangerous. It never goes out of the way: it never
disobeys, it never rebels, it is not revolutionary. No machine is
revolutionary; it cannot be. All machines are orthodox: they obey, they
follow. Society tries to change you into a mechanical thing. Then you
are more efficient, less dangerous, reliable, responsible. And there is
no fear, no danger; you can be relied upon.</p><p><br></p><p>The society creates a mechanical device around you: that is the
conditioning. And it allows you only certain outlets and closes certain
things completely. It chooses some fragments from you and approves them,
then rejects all else. It says that only a part of you is good and the
other parts are bad, so deny those parts. Society doesn’t accept you as
a whole, as a unity; it accepts only certain parts. Hence, the
conditioning.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is always destructive; in a way, religion is always
antisocial. But society is very cunning. It tries to convert religion
also into its managerial system. It wants to make religion also a part
of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus is rebellious, the church is not. Jesus is against society – he
has to be, because he is trying to destroy the mechanical part and he is
trying to free your spontaneity. He is bound to be against the society;
the society will crucify him. But just by crucifying him you cannot
destroy Jesus. Really, if you want to destroy Jesus, crucifixion will be
of no help. You will have to organize a church around Jesus; only then
will he be destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that once it happened that the devil was very much
disturbed because one man had achieved enlightenment on earth. He called
his advisers and he asked them, “What to do now? One man has again
achieved truth, he has become enlightened, and our whole profession is
now in danger. What to do? How to prevent people from going to this
man?”</p><p><br></p><p>The oldest follower of the devil said, “Do not be disturbed. We
should go and we should organize a church around him. Do not worry. Then
the church will become the prevention, then people will not be able to
come to him directly. The church will be in between, and whatsoever he
says will not</p><p>be heard by the people directly. The church will first interpret it,
and through interpretation you can destroy anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>Truth can be destroyed most easily if you order it, organize it. When
religion becomes a sect, it becomes a part of society. Whenever religion
is alive and not a sect, it is against society. Jesus is against
society, Mahavira is against society, Buddha is against society. But
Buddhism, Jainism, Christianity, they are all parts of society. They are
religions no more. Religion has to be rebellious. And this is the
rebellion: religion tries to destroy the mechanicalness because the
mechanicalness is your hell. Spontaneity is your heaven; mechanicalness
is your hell.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not going to give you any new pattern – neither new nor old. I
am simply going to destroy the pattern and leave you alone to live
without a pattern. A life without a pattern is a religious life. A life
without any forced order is a religious life. A life without any
discipline, but with inner awareness, is a religious life.</p><p><br></p><p>The last question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THE KENOPANISHAD TOLD US IN THE BEGINNING THAT NOTHING IS TO BE
DENIED AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE TOTAL ACCEPTANCE. BUT IN THE MORNING YOU
SAID THAT PRAYER, IDOL WORSHIP, TEMPLES, CHURCHES, ARE ALL BASED ON
FALSITIES – ON MENTAL PROJECTION. THIS SEEMS TO BE A DENIAL.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not. It is simply stating a fact. To say that a dream is a
dream is not to deny it. To say that a projection is a projection is not
to deny it. To say that a false thing is a false thing is just to state
a fact. It is not to deny it. Total acceptance doesn’t mean that the
falsity has to be stated as true, that the dream has to be called
reality.</p><p><br></p><p>Total acceptance means that whatsoever is, is accepted. If the
worshipper’s mind is projecting deities, divine beings, this has to be
accepted. It is a fact that worshippers have been doing that. And you
are not told to go and try to destroy their projections; you are not
told to go and destroy their idols and their temples. If you understand,
the very understanding will change you. You will not create those
projections. And if you want to create them, then you will know that
these are projections and you can enjoy them as such.</p><p><br></p><p>It is reported of Naropa, one of the greatest Tibetan mystics ever
born.<span class=s4></span>He was a very absurd</p><p>personality. I say “absurd” because he would do things no one would
expect of a master. He was found in a pub drinking.</p><p><br></p><p>Someone said, “Naropa, what are you doing? You are enlightened, you
have achieved the goal, and you are drinking?”</p><p><br></p><p>Naropa said, “This is a game. And when it is a game, I do not care
this way or that. Once I have come to know that I am the eternal within,
why be afraid of this alcohol? Why be afraid?”</p><p>I say “absurd personality” – but he is saying that this is alcohol
and that whatsoever is created by alcohol is a dream. He is not saying
this is reality; he is saying this is a dream. He said, “I am not
obsessed for or against. It happened that a friend invited me and I
didn’t want to say no. A friend invited me. For him this is real, for me
this is a dream. But this is a dream for me, not for him. Why be
bothered? It will be difficult for him.”</p><p><br></p><p>I will tell you something else which will be nearer the point – less
absurd.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened that Kabir’s family became very much disturbed. The
family was poor and whosoever would come to Kabir’s house, Kabir would
invite him for food. And at least two hundred people would come every
day for his DARSHAN, to see him. And he would go on inviting everyone
for food.</p><p><br></p><p>Then his son Kamaal said one night, “Stop all this! We are poor. We
have been begging, we have borrowed; now no one is going to give
anything. What are you doing? You will reduce us to being thieves.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was very angry. But Kabir laughed and said, “Why didn’t you think
of it before? Be a thief! This is a good idea!”</p><p><br></p><p>But Kamaal was also his son, Kabir’s son, so he looked at him: Kabir,
a mystic, saying this – to be a thief? He must not be in his senses, or
he does not understand what he is saying. But Kamaal said, “Okay, if you
say so, then I will go. I will steal but you will have to come with me.”
Kamaal was thinking that now Kabir would come to his senses. Kabir going
to steal...?</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir stood up and said, “Okay, I am coming.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kamaal carried the whole thing to the very extreme. He was thinking
that somewhere at the last moment Kabir would laugh and say, “I was just
joking.” But no! Kamaal entered a house, pulled out some things from the
owner’s treasure, brought them out, and Kabir was ready, waiting there.
This was the last point; now there was no further possibility to change
things. Now Kamaal asked, “What is to be done? Shall we take these
things to the house?”</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir said, “Okay, but first you must go back, awaken the people of
that house, and tell them.” Kamaal asked, “What way of stealing is
this?”</p><p>Kabir said, “At least they should be told; otherwise they will be
unnecessarily worried.”</p><p><br></p><p>Those who follow Kabir have stopped narrating this story in their
books because it is absurd. Kabir approving stealing? But what was the
matter? In the morning Kamaal asked, “What is the matter now? Tell me
the whole thing. You are in favor of stealing?”</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir said, “Everything belongs to God. No one else is the
owner.”</p><p><br></p><p>Look at this mind. For this mind everything is acceptable. There is
total acceptance. Even stealing is accepted. But he says, “Go and tell
the people so that they are not unnecessarily worried.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kamaal said to him, “But they will think we are thieves.”</p><p>Kabir said, “They are right. We are!”</p><p><br></p><p>Kamaal said, “But then the next day all your respect will go to the
dust. No one will honor you.” Kabir said, “That’s right! Why should they
honor thieves?”</p><p>Total acceptance means not denying anything. When you accept, you
accept with conditions. You say, “Okay, I will do this if that is not
going to happen. I can steal if God is not going to throw me into hell.
I can steal if there is no sin in it. I can steal if people are not
going to dishonor me for it.” What people will do has to be accepted
also. TOTAL acceptance is the most alive way of life. But then
everything is accepted; whatsoever happens as a consequence is accepted.
There is no denial on any point. That is the last, the ultimate way of
life. Really, that is what a sannyasin should be. What a sannyasin
should have is total acceptance.</p><p><br></p><p>But when we say that you can create dreams, we are not denying; we
are simply stating a fact. If you like, you can create dreams. I can
help you to create them easily. But remember, they are only dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>The problem arises when dream becomes a reality. You can play with
your Krishna, you can dance with him; nothing is wrong with it. Dance in
itself is so good. What is wrong about it? You are not doing any harm to
anyone playing with your Krishna, dancing. Dance and play! It will be
good for you. But remember that this is not real. It is a projected
thing; you have created it.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can remember this, you will play the game but you will never
be identified with it. You will go on being aware that this is a game. A
game is a game if you are not identified. If you are identified, it has
become serious, it has become a problem. Now you will be obsessed.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

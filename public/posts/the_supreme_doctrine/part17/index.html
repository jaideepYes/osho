IN THIS REFERENCE, EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONCEPT OF SIN IN THE UPANISHADS AND IN THE BIBLE. AND PLEASE ALSO EXPLAIN THE IMPLICATIONS IN HUMAN LIFE.\nThere is a very basic difference. To the biblical religions – to Jews, Christians, and even Mohammedans – the concept of sin is totally different than it is to the Hindus and Buddhists. The concept of sin in Christianity, in The Bible, is related to your acts – to what you do. What you do may be a sin, or it may not be a sin; it may be a virtue but it is related to your doing. To the Upanishads, it is not related to the doing at all. What you do is irrelevant; what you ARE is the point. It is not the doing but the being itself that is significant.\nSo what will it mean to call a man a sinner? We mean that he is ignorant, unaware of his own self. Because of this ignorance, his acts become sins. The act can become a sin only because the doer is ignorant, unaware, unconscious, is living in a state of sleep. Ignorance is sin and awareness is virtue. Your acts are irrelevant because they are not central; in the center is your consciousness. If something is wrong with the consciousness, your acts will go wrong. If the consciousness is set right, your acts will follow.\n198\nSo just to go on changing your acts will not lead you anywhere. You can commit a sin, you can repent a sin, you can replace a sin by a virtue, by a virtuous act – but it will not be of any meaning for the Upanishads if YOU remain the same. Unless you change, your consciousness changes, unless you attain a new plane of being, a new plenitude, just a change of your acts is useless.\nSo the Upanishads do not think in terms of acts; they think in terms of your being. Alert, aware, conscious, you are virtuous. Why? – because the more you are alert and conscious and aware, the less is the possibility of committing a sin. The basic requirement for committing a sin is to be unconscious.\nFor example, you can be angry only if you forget yourself. If you are self-remembering, aware, anger is impossible. It cannot exist with awareness. No coexistence is possible. When you are aware, it is not that you control your anger, restrain your anger, suppress your anger – no! It simply cannot be there. In a fully aware person, anger cannot exist, just as in a fully lighted room darkness cannot exist. The coexistence is impossible.\nThe moment you bring a lamp into the dark room, the darkness is no more there. With the light the darkness cannot exist. And the Upanishads say it is futile and foolish to fight with darkness because you CANNOT fight with darkness. If you fight you will be defeated. Howsoever strong you may be, you cannot fight darkness because darkness is only the absence of light. Bring the light and darkness disappears.\nThe Upanishads say sin is darkness. Bring the light of consciousness and sin disappears. Do not fight with the sin; do not be concerned directly with the sin; do not think in terms of sin. Otherwise you will feel guilty and it will not be a spiritual growth; rather, it will be a fall.\nChristianity has made people very guilty because whatsoever you do is a sin and you have to fight with it. And nothing comes out of it. The more you fight with a sin, the deeper its roots go in you. The more you fight, the stronger it becomes. The more you fight, the more you are a victim of it. Why? – because the fight is with darkness. You cannot win; there is no possibility of victory. And when you get defeated again and again, you become guilty, inferior.\nThis whole effort of fighting with sins, with wrongdoings, makes you feel guilty and inferior. You start feeling that you are absolutely unworthy, that you cannot do anything. Your spirit is not integrated through this fight; rather, it becomes ill with an inferiority complex, a guilt complex.\nThe Upanishads say sins are not important. What you do is immaterial, what you ARE is the point. If you are committing sins it shows only one thing: that you are fast asleep, unaware. So do not fight with the sins; rather, on the contrary, move within and become more and more alert. As alertness grows within, sins disappear without. A moment comes when you are simply a flame of light within, alert to whatsoever you do, alert to whatsoever moves in the mind, alert to whatsoever happens in you. There is no sin then.\nAnd this is possible; this victory is just within your hands. Then you will never have the feeling of being guilty and inferior; you will never feel that you are unworthy. The more you make an effort to be conscious, the more and more you will feel accepted, worthy, welcome – the more you will feel that in you God has some destiny to fulfill.\nI call this approach more scientific, more religious, because it gives man a dignity. If you are concerned with sin as an act, it gives you guiltiness and guiltiness cannot make you religious. And through guilt you cannot feel the divine because your own guilt becomes a barrier. If you are deeply in guilt, you cannot feel in any way grateful to the divine. The gratitude cannot exist there.\nWhen you are accepted, when you feel worthy, when you feel the abode of the divine, when you feel that a center in you exists which is beyond all acts, when you come nearer and nearer to this inner flame, you become more and more grateful. Gratitude is the perfume that happens to a religious mind. Guilt is just bad odor, just a bad smell. If you feel guilty, around you there is a bad odor, a bad smell.\nTo me, the Upanishads are more penetrating because they reach to the very being, to the very core of the problem. Christian or Jewish attitudes are more superficial because they touch on the periphery. They touch the act, not the being. And they think that by changing the acts the being will be changed. It is not possible. You can go on changing the acts but the being cannot be changed because the periphery cannot change the center, the outer cannot change the inner, the superficial cannot change the basic. But if you change the center, the periphery changes automatically; if you change the inner, the outer follows it.\nIf I change you, your shadow will be changed. But if I try to paint your shadow and change it, you will not be changed by it. And my whole effort will be futile because a shadow cannot even be painted. If you move, the shadow will move with you and my paint will remain on the earth and your shadow will remain untouched. Working with acts is like working with the shadow. What you do is just superficial. What you are, what your being is, is the central thing.\nThe Upanishads touch the being, so they call AGYAN – ignorance, unawareness – the only sin. So the sutra says that one who realizes thus destroys sin. Just by realizing the Brahman sins are destroyed – all your past sins. You may have committed many wrong acts through lives and lives; they are accumulated there. And they are also destroyed just by your reaching and touching the innermost core of your being.\nHow are they destroyed? Our calculating minds will think, “I will have to repay each sin. For each sin I will have to do something virtuous to cancel it.” But the Upanishads say that just by realizing IT, just by realizing the suchness, all sins are destroyed.\nHow are they destroyed? – because yOU are not doing anything to destroy them. The phenomenon is very subtle. It is just like this: you dream in the night that you are committing adultery, you are committing murder, you have burned a whole city – that you have committed many sins. In the morning you are awake. The dream lingers a little, you remember it but you do not feel any guilt about it – or do you feel it? If you still feel some guilt about it, that means you are not yet awake. You are still sleepy and the dream still has a little hangover around you; it is still with you. When you are really alert and awake, you can laugh about the whole thing because it was a dream. Really, you never committed anything.\nThe Upanishads say this is the happening: when a person is awakened into Brahman, all the lives that he has lived and all that he has done simply disappears like a long dream. With a new awareness, all that is past appears to be illusory, as if it never happened, or as if it happened in a story – a dream-drama.\nThat is why Upanishads call this world maya – illusory. Not that it is not, not that it is unreal, but because of this happening, when a person awakens into deep meditation, the whole world he has been living in up to now appears dreamlike; it has no substance to it now.\nHence, this sutra: this sutra says when one realizes that, the suchness of existence, the Brahman, all sins are destroyed. Nothing is to be done about them. They simply are no more with you, you have passed them, you have gone beyond them. Now they belong to a past memory with no substance in it. You can relate them as if they were dreams.\nThe Upanishads say that human consciousness has four states. One: while you are awake, the waking consciousness; second: while you are dreaming, the dreaming consciousness; third: while you are so fast asleep that there is no dream, the sleeping consciousness. And beyond these three is the fourth. The Upanishads have not given it a name. They simply call it the fourth – TURIYA. Turiya means the fourth. That fourth is the state where you realize Brahman. All of the first three states are illusory if you enter the fourth. Think of it in this way because that fourth is not yet your experience. But you have experienced these three; thinking about these three something can be inferred about the fourth.\nWhile you are awake, while you are in the waking consciousness during the day, what happens? The dreaming consciousness has disappeared, it is no more. The sleeping consciousness has disappeared, it is no more. Then the night will fall and you will fall asleep again; dreams will start. When the dreams start you change the consciousness. The gear of consciousness is changed; now all that was in your waking consciousness simply disappears.\nYou were awake in Mount Abu but you can dream you are in London or New York or Calcutta. Mount Abu simply disappears; it is no more for the dreaming consciousness. For the dreaming consciousness London is more real and you cannot even remember that you were in Mount Abu while awake. It disappears so completely that there is not even a trace left. And you cannot feel any contradiction and you cannot raise any question: “How did it happen? I was in Mount Abu and now I am in London.” No, not even a doubt arises because the one has so totally disappeared that you cannot bring it in to compare.\nIn the waking state you were living with your wife in the house. In the dream the wife has disappeared, the house has disappeared. You are living with another woman; you have again married. And there is not even any guilt that you have not divorced your wife – because you cannot compare. The first has disappeared so completely that there is no contradiction, no inconsistency about it.\nAnd then you enter the third state, deep sleep, where dreams disappear. Now the waking state, the wife, the house, they have already disappeared. Now the dreaming state, the wife you have just now married, the new house, they have disappeared. Now both states have disappeared. You are so fast asleep that you do not remember anything.\nAnd then in the morning you are entering waking consciousness again. Now the dream has disappeared, the sleep has disappeared. The same wife, the same house, again start – the same world. Now again you are in Mount Abu. The Upanishads say these three states show that whenever one of these states gets a grip on you, the other two disappear.\nThere is a fourth state. We are making all the effort for that fourth – to be beyond these three. That fourth state is called turiya – total awareness. In that total awareness all these three disappear and all that belongs to these three disappears. That fourth cannot be transcended. There is no fifth state of consciousness. The fourth is the last. Buddhas live in it, Christs live in it, Krishnas live in it. It cannot be transcended. Because it cannot be transcended, it cannot be canceled by anything. Hence, the Upanishads say this is the ultimate reality. All else was just relatively real. That which cannot be canceled by anything is the final, the ultimate, the absolutely real.\nThe sins, all that you have done, simply disappear because you come to realize your being which is not a doer at all. It has not done anything; it is just a witnessing self. And all that was done, was done by nature – the natural laws.\nIt is very difficult for the society to understand it. That is why no society exists in the world which has Upanishadic teaching as its basis. No society can exist with it, it is so dangerous a teaching. Hindus go on reading the Upanishads but even they never try to construct a society, to create a society around this teaching, because this is such a high standpoint for looking at things. It says that if a murderer is committing a murder this is how things are – how nature is functioning within him, how nature has become murderous through him. One day, when this man will achieve the final consciousness, he will laugh. He will say, “I never committed this. Just a situation, natural forces, did the whole work.”\nBut if this is taught right now, this will create a confusion in the mind and a fear that “If this is taught then everyone will commit murder and will say, ‘What can I do? It is how nature is functioning in me.’” This fear is also false because those who commit murder will commit it no matter what you say. We have been giving punishment as much as possible – imprisonment, life sentence, even death – but nothing has changed. Murders go on being committed; rather, they go on increasing.\nWe have never tried the other alternative. As far as I feel, as far as I know, if we base the society on the Upanishadic teaching, not a single extra murder will be there. Things will remain as they are but there will be more possibility for man to be transformed.\nThis is difficult because the whole of humanity has been conditioned to believe that man is a sinner and he must be prevented; otherwise he will go on committing sins. He must be imprisoned, punished. He must be tortured so that he is prevented from committing sins. But we have not prevented anyone – not a single man have we been able to prevent.\nI have heard that in England, in the old days just two hundred years ago, whenever a thief was caught he was to be flogged naked before the whole town at the crossroads. He would be hanged there and flogged just to teach the whole town what happens if you commit stealing. But then it had to be stopped because the whole village would gather to see the thief being flogged, and the pickpockets would try their art just there on the crowd. And people were so attentive in looking at this torture that they would forget their pockets. So then it became obvious that this was nonsense; no one was learning anything. Exactly there on the spot people were committing stealing, they were doing the exact same thing.\nTo me, this phenomenon seems to be very symbolic. All our imprisonments, sentences, death sentences, our tortures, have been futile; they have not changed a single man. They cannot\nbecause a man is a configuration of so many natural forces. Just by punishing, you cannot change that configuration. A man is such a deep-rooted phenomenon that just by beating him you cannot change his consciousness.\nAnd really, this has been a very long game, very futile because the person who is beating is of the same type. Policemen and thieves, they belong to the same category. Murderers and judges, they belong to the same category. They are just standing on opposite poles but their quality of consciousness is similar. One is committing a sin against the society; another is committing a sin for the society.\nIf you murder someone you will be murdered by the society and a murder by the society is not a sin. How can you change murder by murder? How can you change violence by violence? You increase it; you double it. You can take revenge but you cannot change anything.\nThe Upanishads say that when you come to the innermost core of being and become alert, totally alert about what has happened, then you know it was PRAKRITI – nature – which was doing all. You have always been a witness – the PURUSHA.\nThe deepest philosophy in India has been SAMKHYA, and samkhya says all activity belongs to nature; only consciousness belongs to you. All activity, virtuous or sinful – all activity – belongs to nature. To you belongs only consciousness. Attain consciousness, become one with that, and all sins will be destroyed and you will be established in Brahman.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nIN MANY TRADITIONS THE TOTAL TRANSMISSION WAS PASSED FROM A MASTER TO ONLY ONE DISCIPLE, SUCH AS FROM BUDDHA TO MAHAKASHYAPA, FROM BODHIDHARMA TO HUI-KE, DOWN TO HUI NENG, WHOM YOU MENTIONED THIS MORNING. DO YOU HAVE SUCH A ONE RIGHT DISCIPLE TO WHOM YOU PLAN TO TRANSFER TOTAL KNOWLEDGE AMONG YOUR DISCIPLES? IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT YOU WILL DO THIS WITH A NUMBER OF PERSONS RATHER THAN ONLY ONE? WHY IS IT THAT THE ULTIMATE SECRET IS USUALLY TRANSMITTED TO ONLY ONE IN MANY TRADITIONS?\nIt is not transmitted to only one. It is transmitted to many but only one is authorized to transmit it further. Buddha transmitted his knowing to thousands but he gave his authority to Mahakashyapa because he was the most capable of being a master. It is not so difficult to become enlightened but to become a master is very difficult. There are many enlightened persons but not all enlightened persons are masters.\nWhen you become enlightened, it is your own thing but to be a master you need some art to convey it to others. And it is the most difficult art because something has to be conveyed which cannot be conveyed; something has to be transmitted which is not transmittable; something has to be said which cannot be said in language. So a very highly qualified artist can be appointed to transmit it.\nIt happened that Buddha came one day with a flower in his hand and he sat under the tree. He was going to talk to the disciples but he remained silent and the disciples became uneasy. It had never happened before. He would come and he would start talking, so why was he silent on this day? And he went on looking at the flower as if he had forgotten completely that ten thousand disciples were gathered there to listen to him.\nMinutes passed and they looked very long at him but no one had the courage to say, “What are you doing? Have you forgotten us? Have you forgotten what you have called us for and what you wanted to say?”\nHe had called them particularly and they had come with great expectations. He had become very old, so they thought that before he left the body he was going to say something secret, esoteric, something very essential that he had not said before. And then he remained silent and he continued looking at the flower. The silence became heavy, it became a burden. Everyone was uncomfortable. And then Mahakashyapa, one of the disciples, laughed. And this Mahakashyapa is rare because his name had never been mentioned before this. He was an unknown disciple as far as the world is concerned but not to Buddha. Buddha must have known him.\nThere were many famous disciples. Sariputta was there who was a great teacher in his own right. Moggalayan was there: he was also a great teacher in his own right; he had thousands of disciples of his own. Ananda was there, the closest one, who was constantly with Buddha like a shadow. And there were many – very well known, famous in some way or other. And this Mahakashyapa was never mentioned in Buddhist scriptures before this episode.\nHe laughed. Buddha looked at him. Buddha smiled and asked Mahakashyapa to come near. Mahakashyapa reached near. Buddha gave the flower to him without saying a single word. And then he said to the assembly, “All which could be said through language I have said to you and that which cannot be said through language I have given to Mahakashyapa.”\nThis is called the great transmission. Mahakashyapa could understand the language of silence and one who can understand the language of silence can teach and convey things through silence. Mahakashyapa is not the only one to whom Buddha has given his secret key; the secret key had been given to many. But the secretmost key can be conveyed only in silence and Mahakashyapa understood that language. Then he was appointed to go on conveying this silent teaching.\nBodhidharma is the sixth in that tradition. Mahakashyapa was the first who got the teaching from Buddha; Bodhidharma is the sixth. And Bodhidharma went around India to find a person who could understand that language of silence. He couldn’t find him here; that is why he had to go to China. There he met Hui-Ke, after sitting for nine years in front of a wall.\nBuddha had given his enlightenment, the taste of it, to many but they were not all masters. They attained it for themselves and then they dissolved into infinity.\nTo be a master is a very difficult and delicate thing. You have attained the infinity, and still somehow you remain here on this shore to teach others. It is very difficult. In a sense, it happens so rarely that it seems exceptional because one who has known the infinity would like to dissolve into it. Why bother teaching you? Why bother saying something to those who cannot understand or to those\nwho can only misunderstand? Why go on teaching them? Why bother? One would like to move into silence, into bliss, into the infinite, and forget the world.\nA master means someone to whom the call of bliss is less urgent than the call of compassion. He says, “Wait.” The infinite can wait; there is no hurry about it. The bliss can wait, the ultimate dissolution can wait a little; there is no hurry about it.\nA master means a being who lingers on a little more on this shore. It is very difficult because he will have to devise things which will allow him to linger here a little more. And this is going to be very arduous because now the body wants to rest, to go back to nature. Once you become enlightened, the body wants to rest. Now there is no need to carry it. The body would like to dissolve back into nature because the destiny is fulfilled. Now the house is not needed; now the bird of the soul can fly to the infinite. This abode is useless. Why carry it on? But a master has to carry on. He has to create devices through which he can go on carrying the body in order to help others.\nThe body is not the only problem. The very effort seems so futile because you talk to ten thousand people and maybe only a single one will understand. And the remaining nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine will create such problems for you... they will create problems and troubles for you in every way.\nThis is natural because they cannot understand you and whatsoever you say and do becomes dangerous for them because their established values are challenged. Their established life is challenged, their way of living is challenged – everything. You go on giving shocks to them, so they will take revenge. They will do whatsoever they can do to stop you – to stop you from helping them. Thus, it is easy for an enlightened person to simply dissolve.\nSo Buddha says that there are two types of enlightened persons. One he calls an ARHAT; by arhat he means one who has attained his self and who is not bothered by anything else, he simply dissolves like a drop into the ocean. The other he calls BODHISATTVA; by bodhisattva he means one who has become an arhat, but who resists the ultimate desire – the ultimate desire to dissolve – who resists the ultimate desire and lingers on this shore, on this bank, to help others. And Buddha says that the bodhisattva is making a great sacrifice.\nArhats can never become masters; only bodhisattvas can become masters. And neither can all bodhisattvas become masters because mastery needs a particular training – a particular training to convey, a particular training to help, a particular training to advise and counsel, a particular training to create new devices – because with every individual something different is needed and with every age something different is needed.\nThat is why all old techniques become meaningless. They were devised for particular minds and those minds are no more in the world. And we go on practicing those techniques. They cannot help many; they can help only very few. New devices are needed. You can become a master only when you are able to create new devices and be inventive and creative.\nIt is not that enlightenment and the secret keys of its knowledge are delivered to only one. They are delivered to many but to only one as a master who will be capable of delivering the key on further.\nNow, because this will be the last meeting, I would like to say something to you before you leave the campus. Firstly, this has been my observation – that ninety percent of you, and this is a very great number, have been doing meditation very intensely. This is very hopeful but the intensity was more or less dependent on the group. It may be difficult for you to be so intense back at home.\nSo do one thing: when you do the meditation at home, close your eyes first, feel me present just before you as I am here. Visualize me, visualize the group around you and then start meditation as you have been doing with the group. That will be very helpful. If you have a tape-recording, then put it on so that the whole atmosphere is created and you are not alone. It is very difficult to do it so intensely individually. The group soul possesses you.\nBack home you will even feel, you will even wonder, that for three times every day you were making such strenuous effort. You may not be able even to imagine how you could do that. The group soul grips you. Then you are just in a current; then you are just moving in a flood; then the whole group pushes you on.\nMany people come to me and say, “In the camp it is wonderful but when we go back it is lost.” Even back home remember the group, visualize the group, feel the group, and the group will be there. At least I will be there.\nAnd if you are a sannyasin, then just take the locket in your hand and exhale deeply three times. Do not inhale. Exhale deeply and allow the body to inhale: you do not inhale. Just exhale three times, remember me, and start – and I will be there.\nSpace and time do not really matter. If your intensity is such that you can feel me, I will be there. The space disappears, time disappears, and ninety percent of you will be capable of doing the same as you are doing here. And it is good to do it alone. It is good to start in a group but it is not good to become dependent on the group forever.\nBut do not leave a gap. The day you are back home start immediately. Do not say, “Let me rest for a week and then I will start.” Then you will never start; that is a trick of the mind. Immediately you are home, start it. It will be happening to you there. And once it can happen to you individually, you have become independent. Meditation can be started in a group but it must end in independence. You must become independent of the group.\nThe second thing: many of you will feel afraid of your neighbors, of your family. They will think you have gone mad. Here it is no problem because everyone is more mad than you... so you are not afraid. No one is going to say that you are mad. The whole atmosphere, the milieu, is different. It is cooperative here. But back home the whole atmosphere will be against you. That creates a barrier. So it will be good to tell your family, “I am experimenting with this method and this is a mad method.” Go around to your neighbors and tell them, “In the morning for one hour I will be doing this method – and this is absolutely mad, but do not get disturbed.”\nTell them this rather than hiding because if you hide you cannot do it rightly; you will always go on suppressing something. Just go around and tell them by yourself. And only for a few days, three or four days, will people be interested in you. Then they will forget because no one has the time to go on thinking about you, that you have become mad. After three or four days they get adjusted and they know that you are doing something.\nAnd if you continue it for three months, they will start asking you what you are doing because now something will be happening to you – so apparently, so obviously. It will be coming on your face, in your eyes, in your movements. The way you will behave, everything, will change. You will take on a new grace. A new silence will follow you and a subtle joy not caused by anything. Just because you are alive, a subtle joy will be there with you and everyone will be able to feel the difference. Then they will start asking you. Then they will never think you mad.\nSo if you can persist in this madness, no one will think you a madman. But persistence is needed – and in the beginning, a little courage. If you are a coward, then of course you cannot continue it. Do not try to rationalize it; do not say others will be disturbed. No one is disturbed. You can even invite your whole family to look at you. They will enjoy it. No one will be disturbed; it will be a free entertainment for them!\nInvite the neighbors. Tell them that you have come from a meditation camp where you have learned a technique and you want to show it to them. In the beginning they will laugh but they cannot laugh for long. They will get serious about it. But your change will prove its effect; nothing else can prove it. You cannot argue about it.\nThe third thing: do not try to convince anybody about it; do not argue. It is useless; you simply waste your energy. There is only one argument which can prove anything and that is you. If YOU change, you become a very vital argument. If you do not change, just arguing is useless; you cannot convince anybody. Just reasoning never convinces; only your being convinces. So do not be argumentative about it.\nThis has been my feeling: when you learn something new, you become argumentative; you go on talking about it. And it is not that you are doing harm to anybody – you may be simply thinking to help them. When something is so fresh to you and you have experienced something new, you want to share it. This is natural. It may be natural but it is not wise because the other is absolutely unacquainted with what you are talking about.\nAnd my methods particularly are so mad that you cannot convince anybody! Do not try it because if you cannot convince anyone, it may have a harmful effect on you. Your failure will make you less confident. Then you will become hesitant within. You cannot convince anybody and others can convince you that you have gone mad – that you are wrong. They can convince you because you have had a subtle experience which is inexpressible. How can you convey it? Unless someone is very welcoming and receptive, you cannot convey it. To say no to anything is very easy; to negate is very easy. To be positive, to say yes, is very difficult.\nChekhov has written a story. One man in a village was so idiotic, so stupid, that the whole village knew about it, that he was stupid. And he himself became so convinced that he was stupid that he became afraid even to talk, to utter a single word, because the moment he said anything someone would say, “What a stupid thing you are saying! What a silly thing.”\nHe was so depressed, he went to a sage and asked him, “What to do? I am such a proved idiot that I cannot even utter a single word. Before I utter anything, they say, ‘Be silent. Do not speak!’”\nThe sage said, “Do one thing: never say yes to anything from now on. Whatsoever you see, condemn it.”\nThe idiot said, “But they will not listen to me.”\nThe sage said, “Don’t bother. If they say, ‘This is a beautiful painting,’ say, ‘This painting beautiful? Such an ugly thing I have not seen before!’ If they say, ‘This novel is very original,’ say, ‘This is just a repetition. Thousands of times the same story has been written.’ Do not bother to prove it. Simply say no to everything; make it your basic philosophy. If someone says that the night is beautiful, the moon is beautiful, say, ‘You call this beauty?’ And they cannot prove otherwise, remember. They cannot prove!”\nThe man went back to his village. He started saying no to everything. Within a week there was a rumor around the village: “We were wrong. That man is not an idiot. He is a great critic; he is a genius.”\nTo say no needs no wisdom. If you want to become a great genius, say no, be a critic. Never bother to say yes to anything. Whatsoever anybody says, deny it flatly. And no one can prove it because to prove anything is very difficult. ‘No’ is the simplest trick.\nWhen you are talking of higher experiences, anybody can say no to you. Any stupid man can say no and you cannot prove otherwise. So be alert. Do not talk about it unless you feel that a very sympathetic heart is there to listen, to receive. And do not argue. If something has happened to you, your being will become the argument. Do not waste any energy convincing anyone. Use all the energy that you have in transforming yourself. Your transformation will help many; your argument can help no one.\nOnce you are transformed, people will start falling in love with you. They will become receptive, inviting; they will become hosts. And whatsoever you say to them will be received as a seed; they will carry it in their hearts. But do not try to convince anyone; do not argue; do not be intellectual and rational about it. The whole phenomenon is so absurd, it is so paradoxical!\nIt is paradoxical because through being consciously mad you go beyond all madness. A person meditating with this technique cannot go mad. It is impossible because he is throwing out all madness, not accumulating it. And unless you accumulate, you cannot be mad.\nYou are daily cleansing yourself; you are daily passing through a catharsis. You are changing – transforming your madness into meditation. Doing this method, apparently so mad, you will create the possibility where real sanity will happen to you. This is paradoxical; this is why I call it absurd.\nLaugh, sing, dance, but do not argue. Your dance can become infectious, your singing can become infectious. Your laughter, coming deep from your heart, can penetrate others’ hearts. Be more joyful, blissful, ecstatic, as if every moment is a blessing and every moment is a gratitude. And make every moment a celebration.\n\u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"6380","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_supreme_doctrine/part17/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_supreme_doctrine/>The Supreme Doctrine</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">17 Make Every Moment a Celebration</h1><div class=post-meta>30 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6380 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Supreme_Doctrine/part17.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part16>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p><span id=bookmark16>‌</span>CHAPTER <span class=s3>17</span></p><p><br></p><p>Make Every Moment a Celebration</p><p><br></p><p>16 July 1973 pm in Mt Abu Meditation Camp</p><p><br></p><p>The first question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IN THE MORNING YOU SAID THAT ONE WHO REALIZES THE BRAHMAN THUS
DESTROYS SIN AND IS WELL ESTABLISHED IN BRAHMAN. IN THIS REFERENCE,
EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONCEPT OF SIN IN THE UPANISHADS AND
IN THE BIBLE. AND PLEASE ALSO EXPLAIN THE IMPLICATIONS IN HUMAN
LIFE.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a very basic difference. To the biblical religions – to
Jews, Christians, and even Mohammedans – the concept of sin is totally
different than it is to the Hindus and Buddhists. The concept of sin in
Christianity, in The Bible, is related to your acts – to what you do.
What you do may be a sin, or it may not be a sin; it may be a virtue but
it is related to your doing. To the Upanishads, it is not related to the
doing at all. What you do is irrelevant; what you ARE is the point. It
is not the doing but the being itself that is significant.</p><p><br></p><p>So what will it mean to call a man a sinner? We mean that he is
ignorant, unaware of his own self. Because of this ignorance, his acts
become sins. The act can become a sin only because the doer is ignorant,
unaware, unconscious, is living in a state of sleep. Ignorance is sin
and awareness is virtue. Your acts are irrelevant because they are not
central; in the center is your consciousness. If something is wrong with
the consciousness, your acts will go wrong. If the consciousness is set
right, your acts will follow.</p><p><br></p><p>198</p><p>So just to go on changing your acts will not lead you anywhere. You
can commit a sin, you can repent a sin, you can replace a sin by a
virtue, by a virtuous act – but it will not be of any meaning for the
Upanishads if YOU remain the same. Unless you change, your consciousness
changes, unless you attain a new plane of being, a new plenitude, just a
change of your acts is useless.</p><p><br></p><p>So the Upanishads do not think in terms of acts; they think in terms
of your being. Alert, aware, conscious, you are virtuous. Why? – because
the more you are alert and conscious and aware, the less is the
possibility of committing a sin. The basic requirement for committing a
sin is to be unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, you can be angry only if you forget yourself. If you are
self-remembering, aware, anger is impossible. It cannot exist with
awareness. No coexistence is possible. When you are aware, it is not
that you control your anger, restrain your anger, suppress your anger –
no! It simply cannot be there. In a fully aware person, anger cannot
exist, just as in a fully lighted room darkness cannot exist. The
coexistence is impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment you bring a lamp into the dark room, the darkness is no
more there. With the light the darkness cannot exist. And the Upanishads
say it is futile and foolish to fight with darkness because you CANNOT
fight with darkness. If you fight you will be defeated. Howsoever strong
you may be, you cannot fight darkness because darkness is only the
absence of light. Bring the light and darkness disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>The Upanishads say sin is darkness. Bring the light of consciousness
and sin disappears. Do not fight with the sin; do not be concerned
directly with the sin; do not think in terms of sin. Otherwise you will
feel guilty and it will not be a spiritual growth; rather, it will be a
fall.</p><p><br></p><p>Christianity has made people very guilty because whatsoever you do is
a sin and you have to fight with it. And nothing comes out of it. The
more you fight with a sin, the deeper its roots go in you. The more you
fight, the stronger it becomes. The more you fight, the more you are a
victim of it. Why? – because the fight is with darkness. You cannot win;
there is no possibility of victory. And when you get defeated again and
again, you become guilty, inferior.</p><p><br></p><p>This whole effort of fighting with sins, with wrongdoings, makes you
feel guilty and inferior. You start feeling that you are absolutely
unworthy, that you cannot do anything. Your spirit is not integrated
through this fight; rather, it becomes ill with an inferiority complex,
a guilt complex.</p><p><br></p><p>The Upanishads say sins are not important. What you do is immaterial,
what you ARE is the point. If you are committing sins it shows only one
thing: that you are fast asleep, unaware. So do not fight with the sins;
rather, on the contrary, move within and become more and more alert. As
alertness grows within, sins disappear without. A moment comes when you
are simply a flame of light within, alert to whatsoever you do, alert to
whatsoever moves in the mind, alert to whatsoever happens in you. There
is no sin then.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is possible; this victory is just within your hands. Then
you will never have the feeling of being guilty and inferior; you will
never feel that you are unworthy. The more you make an effort to be
conscious, the more and more you will feel accepted, worthy, welcome –
the more you will feel that in you God has some destiny to fulfill.</p><p>I call this approach more scientific, more religious, because it
gives man a dignity. If you are concerned with sin as an act, it gives
you guiltiness and guiltiness cannot make you religious. And through
guilt you cannot feel the divine because your own guilt becomes a
barrier. If you are deeply in guilt, you cannot feel in any way grateful
to the divine. The gratitude cannot exist there.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are accepted, when you feel worthy, when you feel the abode
of the divine, when you feel that a center in you exists which is beyond
all acts, when you come nearer and nearer to this inner flame, you
become more and more grateful. Gratitude is the perfume that happens to
a religious mind. Guilt is just bad odor, just a bad smell. If you feel
guilty, around you there is a bad odor, a bad smell.</p><p><br></p><p>To me, the Upanishads are more penetrating because they reach to the
very being, to the very core of the problem. Christian or Jewish
attitudes are more superficial because they touch on the periphery. They
touch the act, not the being. And they think that by changing the acts
the being will be changed. It is not possible. You can go on changing
the acts but the being cannot be changed because the periphery cannot
change the center, the outer cannot change the inner, the superficial
cannot change the basic. But if you change the center, the periphery
changes automatically; if you change the inner, the outer follows
it.</p><p><br></p><p>If I change you, your shadow will be changed. But if I try to paint
your shadow and change it, you will not be changed by it. And my whole
effort will be futile because a shadow cannot even be painted. If you
move, the shadow will move with you and my paint will remain on the
earth and your shadow will remain untouched. Working with acts is like
working with the shadow. What you do is just superficial. What you are,
what your being is, is the central thing.</p><p><br></p><p>The Upanishads touch the being, so they call AGYAN – ignorance,
unawareness – the only sin. So the sutra says that one who realizes thus
destroys sin. Just by realizing the Brahman sins are destroyed – all
your past sins. You may have committed many wrong acts through lives and
lives; they are accumulated there. And they are also destroyed just by
your reaching and touching the innermost core of your being.</p><p><br></p><p>How are they destroyed? Our calculating minds will think, “I will
have to repay each sin. For each sin I will have to do something
virtuous to cancel it.” But the Upanishads say that just by realizing
IT, just by realizing the suchness, all sins are destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>How are they destroyed? – because yOU are not doing anything to
destroy them. The phenomenon is very subtle. It is just like this: you
dream in the night that you are committing adultery, you are committing
murder, you have burned a whole city – that you have committed many
sins. In the morning you are awake. The dream lingers a little, you
remember it but you do not feel any guilt about it – or do you feel it?
If you still feel some guilt about it, that means you are not yet awake.
You are still sleepy and the dream still has a little hangover around
you; it is still with you. When you are really alert and awake, you can
laugh about the whole thing because it was a dream. Really, you never
committed anything.</p><p><br></p><p>The Upanishads say this is the happening: when a person is awakened
into Brahman, all the lives that he has lived and all that he has done
simply disappears like a long dream. With a new awareness, all that is
past appears to be illusory, as if it never happened, or as if it
happened in a story – a dream-drama.</p><p>That is why Upanishads call this world maya – illusory. Not that it
is not, not that it is unreal, but because of this happening, when a
person awakens into deep meditation, the whole world he has been living
in up to now appears dreamlike; it has no substance to it now.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, this sutra: this sutra says when one realizes that, the
suchness of existence, the Brahman, all sins are destroyed. Nothing is
to be done about them. They simply are no more with you, you have passed
them, you have gone beyond them. Now they belong to a past memory with
no substance in it. You can relate them as if they were dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>The Upanishads say that human consciousness has four states. One:
while you are awake, the waking consciousness; second: while you are
dreaming, the dreaming consciousness; third: while you are so fast
asleep that there is no dream, the sleeping consciousness. And beyond
these three is the fourth. The Upanishads have not given it a name. They
simply call it the fourth – TURIYA. Turiya means the fourth. That fourth
is the state where you realize Brahman. All of the first three states
are illusory if you enter the fourth. Think of it in this way because
that fourth is not yet your experience. But you have experienced these
three; thinking about these three something can be inferred about the
fourth.</p><p><br></p><p>While you are awake, while you are in the waking consciousness during
the day, what happens? The dreaming consciousness has disappeared, it is
no more. The sleeping consciousness has disappeared, it is no more. Then
the night will fall and you will fall asleep again; dreams will start.
When the dreams start you change the consciousness. The gear of
consciousness is changed; now all that was in your waking consciousness
simply disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>You were awake in Mount Abu but you can dream you are in London or
New York or Calcutta. Mount Abu simply disappears; it is no more for the
dreaming consciousness. For the dreaming consciousness London is more
real and you cannot even remember that you were in Mount Abu while
awake. It disappears so completely that there is not even a trace left.
And you cannot feel any contradiction and you cannot raise any question:
“How did it happen? I was in Mount Abu and now I am in London.” No, not
even a doubt arises because the one has so totally disappeared that you
cannot bring it in to compare.</p><p><br></p><p>In the waking state you were living with your wife in the house. In
the dream the wife has disappeared, the house has disappeared. You are
living with another woman; you have again married. And there is not even
any guilt that you have not divorced your wife – because you cannot
compare. The first has disappeared so completely that there is no
contradiction, no inconsistency about it.</p><p><br></p><p>And then you enter the third state, deep sleep, where dreams
disappear. Now the waking state, the wife, the house, they have already
disappeared. Now the dreaming state, the wife you have just now married,
the new house, they have disappeared. Now both states have disappeared.
You are so fast asleep that you do not remember anything.</p><p><br></p><p>And then in the morning you are entering waking consciousness again.
Now the dream has disappeared, the sleep has disappeared. The same wife,
the same house, again start – the same world. Now again you are in Mount
Abu. The Upanishads say these three states show that whenever one of
these states gets a grip on you, the other two disappear.</p><p>There is a fourth state. We are making all the effort for that fourth
– to be beyond these three. That fourth state is called turiya – total
awareness. In that total awareness all these three disappear and all
that belongs to these three disappears. That fourth cannot be
transcended. There is no fifth state of consciousness. The fourth is the
last. Buddhas live in it, Christs live in it, Krishnas live in it. It
cannot be transcended. Because it cannot be transcended, it cannot be
canceled by anything. Hence, the Upanishads say this is the ultimate
reality. All else was just relatively real. That which cannot be
canceled by anything is the final, the ultimate, the absolutely
real.</p><p><br></p><p>The sins, all that you have done, simply disappear because you come
to realize your being which is not a doer at all. It has not done
anything; it is just a witnessing self. And all that was done, was done
by nature – the natural laws.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very difficult for the society to understand it. That is why no
society exists in the world which has Upanishadic teaching as its basis.
No society can exist with it, it is so dangerous a teaching. Hindus go
on reading the Upanishads but even they never try to construct a
society, to create a society around this teaching, because this is such
a high standpoint for looking at things. It says that if a murderer is
committing a murder this is how things are – how nature is functioning
within him, how nature has become murderous through him. One day, when
this man will achieve the final consciousness, he will laugh. He will
say, “I never committed this. Just a situation, natural forces, did the
whole work.”</p><p><br></p><p>But if this is taught right now, this will create a confusion in the
mind and a fear that “If this is taught then everyone will commit murder
and will say, ‘What can I do? It is how nature is functioning in me.’”
This fear is also false because those who commit murder will commit it
no matter what you say. We have been giving punishment as much as
possible – imprisonment, life sentence, even death – but nothing has
changed. Murders go on being committed; rather, they go on
increasing.</p><p><br></p><p>We have never tried the other alternative. As far as I feel, as far
as I know, if we base the society on the Upanishadic teaching, not a
single extra murder will be there. Things will remain as they are but
there will be more possibility for man to be transformed.</p><p><br></p><p>This is difficult because the whole of humanity has been conditioned
to believe that man is a sinner and he must be prevented; otherwise he
will go on committing sins. He must be imprisoned, punished. He must be
tortured so that he is prevented from committing sins. But we have not
prevented anyone – not a single man have we been able to prevent.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that in England, in the old days just two hundred years
ago, whenever a thief was caught he was to be flogged naked before the
whole town at the crossroads. He would be hanged there and flogged just
to teach the whole town what happens if you commit stealing. But then it
had to be stopped because the whole village would gather to see the
thief being flogged, and the pickpockets would try their art just there
on the crowd. And people were so attentive in looking at this torture
that they would forget their pockets. So then it became obvious that
this was nonsense; no one was learning anything. Exactly there on the
spot people were committing stealing, they were doing the exact same
thing.</p><p><br></p><p>To me, this phenomenon seems to be very symbolic. All our
imprisonments, sentences, death sentences, our tortures, have been
futile; they have not changed a single man. They cannot</p><p>because a man is a configuration of so many natural forces. Just by
punishing, you cannot change that configuration. A man is such a
deep-rooted phenomenon that just by beating him you cannot change his
consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>And really, this has been a very long game, very futile because the
person who is beating is of the same type. Policemen and thieves, they
belong to the same category. Murderers and judges, they belong to the
same category. They are just standing on opposite poles but their
quality of consciousness is similar. One is committing a sin against the
society; another is committing a sin for the society.</p><p><br></p><p>If you murder someone you will be murdered by the society and a
murder by the society is not a sin. How can you change murder by murder?
How can you change violence by violence? You increase it; you double it.
You can take revenge but you cannot change anything.</p><p><br></p><p>The Upanishads say that when you come to the innermost core of being
and become alert, totally alert about what has happened, then you know
it was PRAKRITI – nature – which was doing all. You have always been a
witness – the PURUSHA.</p><p><br></p><p>The deepest philosophy in India has been SAMKHYA, and samkhya says
all activity belongs to nature; only consciousness belongs to you. All
activity, virtuous or sinful – all activity – belongs to nature. To you
belongs only consciousness. Attain consciousness, become one with that,
and all sins will be destroyed and you will be established in
Brahman.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IN MANY TRADITIONS THE TOTAL TRANSMISSION WAS PASSED FROM A MASTER TO
ONLY ONE DISCIPLE, SUCH AS FROM BUDDHA TO MAHAKASHYAPA, FROM BODHIDHARMA
TO HUI-KE, DOWN TO HUI NENG, WHOM YOU MENTIONED THIS MORNING. DO YOU
HAVE SUCH A ONE RIGHT DISCIPLE TO WHOM YOU PLAN TO TRANSFER TOTAL
KNOWLEDGE AMONG YOUR DISCIPLES? IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT YOU WILL DO
THIS WITH A NUMBER OF PERSONS RATHER THAN ONLY ONE? WHY IS IT THAT THE
ULTIMATE SECRET IS USUALLY TRANSMITTED TO ONLY ONE IN MANY
TRADITIONS?</p><p><br></p><p>It is not transmitted to only one. It is transmitted to many but only
one is authorized to transmit it further. Buddha transmitted his knowing
to thousands but he gave his authority to Mahakashyapa because he was
the most capable of being a master. It is not so difficult to become
enlightened but to become a master is very difficult. There are many
enlightened persons but not all enlightened persons are masters.</p><p><br></p><p>When you become enlightened, it is your own thing but to be a master
you need some art to convey it to others. And it is the most difficult
art because something has to be conveyed which cannot be conveyed;
something has to be transmitted which is not transmittable; something
has to be said which cannot be said in language. So a very highly
qualified artist can be appointed to transmit it.</p><p>It happened that Buddha came one day with a flower in his hand and he
sat under the tree. He was going to talk to the disciples but he
remained silent and the disciples became uneasy. It had never happened
before. He would come and he would start talking, so why was he silent
on this day? And he went on looking at the flower as if he had forgotten
completely that ten thousand disciples were gathered there to listen to
him.</p><p><br></p><p>Minutes passed and they looked very long at him but no one had the
courage to say, “What are you doing? Have you forgotten us? Have you
forgotten what you have called us for and what you wanted to say?”</p><p><br></p><p>He had called them particularly and they had come with great
expectations. He had become very old, so they thought that before he
left the body he was going to say something secret, esoteric, something
very essential that he had not said before. And then he remained silent
and he continued looking at the flower. The silence became heavy, it
became a burden. Everyone was uncomfortable. And then Mahakashyapa, one
of the disciples, laughed. And this Mahakashyapa is rare because his
name had never been mentioned before this. He was an unknown disciple as
far as the world is concerned but not to Buddha. Buddha must have known
him.</p><p><br></p><p>There were many famous disciples. Sariputta was there who was a great
teacher in his own right. Moggalayan was there: he was also a great
teacher in his own right; he had thousands of disciples of his own.
Ananda was there, the closest one, who was constantly with Buddha like a
shadow. And there were many – very well known, famous in some way or
other. And this Mahakashyapa was never mentioned in Buddhist scriptures
before this episode.</p><p><br></p><p>He laughed. Buddha looked at him. Buddha smiled and asked
Mahakashyapa to come near. Mahakashyapa reached near. Buddha gave the
flower to him without saying a single word. And then he said to the
assembly, “All which could be said through language I have said to you
and that which cannot be said through language I have given to
Mahakashyapa.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is called the great transmission. Mahakashyapa could understand
the language of silence and one who can understand the language of
silence can teach and convey things through silence. Mahakashyapa is not
the only one to whom Buddha has given his secret key; the secret key had
been given to many. But the secretmost key can be conveyed only in
silence and Mahakashyapa understood that language. Then he was appointed
to go on conveying this silent teaching.</p><p><br></p><p>Bodhidharma is the sixth in that tradition. Mahakashyapa was the
first who got the teaching from Buddha; Bodhidharma is the sixth. And
Bodhidharma went around India to find a person who could understand that
language of silence. He couldn’t find him here; that is why he had to go
to China. There he met Hui-Ke, after sitting for nine years in front of
a wall.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha had given his enlightenment, the taste of it, to many but they
were not all masters. They attained it for themselves and then they
dissolved into infinity.</p><p><br></p><p>To be a master is a very difficult and delicate thing. You have
attained the infinity, and still somehow you remain here on this shore
to teach others. It is very difficult. In a sense, it happens so rarely
that it seems exceptional because one who has known the infinity would
like to dissolve into it. Why bother teaching you? Why bother saying
something to those who cannot understand or to those</p><p>who can only misunderstand? Why go on teaching them? Why bother? One
would like to move into silence, into bliss, into the infinite, and
forget the world.</p><p><br></p><p>A master means someone to whom the call of bliss is less urgent than
the call of compassion. He says, “Wait.” The infinite can wait; there is
no hurry about it. The bliss can wait, the ultimate dissolution can wait
a little; there is no hurry about it.</p><p><br></p><p>A master means a being who lingers on a little more on this shore. It
is very difficult because he will have to devise things which will allow
him to linger here a little more. And this is going to be very arduous
because now the body wants to rest, to go back to nature. Once you
become enlightened, the body wants to rest. Now there is no need to
carry it. The body would like to dissolve back into nature because the
destiny is fulfilled. Now the house is not needed; now the bird of the
soul can fly to the infinite. This abode is useless. Why carry it on?
But a master has to carry on. He has to create devices through which he
can go on carrying the body in order to help others.</p><p><br></p><p>The body is not the only problem. The very effort seems so futile
because you talk to ten thousand people and maybe only a single one will
understand. And the remaining nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine
will create such problems for you... they will create problems and
troubles for you in every way.</p><p><br></p><p>This is natural because they cannot understand you and whatsoever you
say and do becomes dangerous for them because their established values
are challenged. Their established life is challenged, their way of
living is challenged – everything. You go on giving shocks to them, so
they will take revenge. They will do whatsoever they can do to stop you
– to stop you from helping them. Thus, it is easy for an enlightened
person to simply dissolve.</p><p><br></p><p>So Buddha says that there are two types of enlightened persons. One
he calls an ARHAT; by arhat he means one who has attained his self and
who is not bothered by anything else, he simply dissolves like a drop
into the ocean. The other he calls BODHISATTVA; by bodhisattva he means
one who has become an arhat, but who resists the ultimate desire – the
ultimate desire to dissolve – who resists the ultimate desire and
lingers on this shore, on this bank, to help others. And Buddha says
that the bodhisattva is making a great sacrifice.</p><p><br></p><p>Arhats can never become masters; only bodhisattvas can become
masters. And neither can all bodhisattvas become masters because mastery
needs a particular training – a particular training to convey, a
particular training to help, a particular training to advise and
counsel, a particular training to create new devices – because with
every individual something different is needed and with every age
something different is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>That is why all old techniques become meaningless. They were devised
for particular minds and those minds are no more in the world. And we go
on practicing those techniques. They cannot help many; they can help
only very few. New devices are needed. You can become a master only when
you are able to create new devices and be inventive and creative.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not that enlightenment and the secret keys of its knowledge are
delivered to only one. They are delivered to many but to only one as a
master who will be capable of delivering the key on further.</p><p>Now, because this will be the last meeting, I would like to say
something to you before you leave the campus. Firstly, this has been my
observation – that ninety percent of you, and this is a very great
number, have been doing meditation very intensely. This is very hopeful
but the intensity was more or less dependent on the group. It may be
difficult for you to be so intense back at home.</p><p><br></p><p>So do one thing: when you do the meditation at home, close your eyes
first, feel me present just before you as I am here. Visualize me,
visualize the group around you and then start meditation as you have
been doing with the group. That will be very helpful. If you have a
tape-recording, then put it on so that the whole atmosphere is created
and you are not alone. It is very difficult to do it so intensely
individually. The group soul possesses you.</p><p><br></p><p>Back home you will even feel, you will even wonder, that for three
times every day you were making such strenuous effort. You may not be
able even to imagine how you could do that. The group soul grips you.
Then you are just in a current; then you are just moving in a flood;
then the whole group pushes you on.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people come to me and say, “In the camp it is wonderful but when
we go back it is lost.” Even back home remember the group, visualize the
group, feel the group, and the group will be there. At least I will be
there.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you are a sannyasin, then just take the locket in your hand
and exhale deeply three times. Do not inhale. Exhale deeply and allow
the body to inhale: you do not inhale. Just exhale three times, remember
me, and start – and I will be there.</p><p><br></p><p>Space and time do not really matter. If your intensity is such that
you can feel me, I will be there. The space disappears, time disappears,
and ninety percent of you will be capable of doing the same as you are
doing here. And it is good to do it alone. It is good to start in a
group but it is not good to become dependent on the group forever.</p><p><br></p><p>But do not leave a gap. The day you are back home start immediately.
Do not say, “Let me rest for a week and then I will start.” Then you
will never start; that is a trick of the mind. Immediately you are home,
start it. It will be happening to you there. And once it can happen to
you individually, you have become independent. Meditation can be started
in a group but it must end in independence. You must become independent
of the group.</p><p><br></p><p>The second thing: many of you will feel afraid of your neighbors, of
your family. They will think you have gone mad. Here it is no problem
because everyone is more mad than you... so you are not afraid. No one
is going to say that you are mad. The whole atmosphere, the milieu, is
different. It is cooperative here. But back home the whole atmosphere
will be against you. That creates a barrier. So it will be good to tell
your family, “I am experimenting with this method and this is a mad
method.” Go around to your neighbors and tell them, “In the morning for
one hour I will be doing this method – and this is absolutely mad, but
do not get disturbed.”</p><p><br></p><p>Tell them this rather than hiding because if you hide you cannot do
it rightly; you will always go on suppressing something. Just go around
and tell them by yourself. And only for a few days, three or four days,
will people be interested in you. Then they will forget because no one
has the time to go on thinking about you, that you have become mad.
After three or four days they get adjusted and they know that you are
doing something.</p><p>And if you continue it for three months, they will start asking you
what you are doing because now something will be happening to you – so
apparently, so obviously. It will be coming on your face, in your eyes,
in your movements. The way you will behave, everything, will change. You
will take on a new grace. A new silence will follow you and a subtle joy
not caused by anything. Just because you are alive, a subtle joy will be
there with you and everyone will be able to feel the difference. Then
they will start asking you. Then they will never think you mad.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you can persist in this madness, no one will think you a
madman. But persistence is needed – and in the beginning, a little
courage. If you are a coward, then of course you cannot continue it. Do
not try to rationalize it; do not say others will be disturbed. No one
is disturbed. You can even invite your whole family to look at you. They
will enjoy it. No one will be disturbed; it will be a free entertainment
for them!</p><p><br></p><p>Invite the neighbors. Tell them that you have come from a meditation
camp where you have learned a technique and you want to show it to them.
In the beginning they will laugh but they cannot laugh for long. They
will get serious about it. But your change will prove its effect;
nothing else can prove it. You cannot argue about it.</p><p><br></p><p>The third thing: do not try to convince anybody about it; do not
argue. It is useless; you simply waste your energy. There is only one
argument which can prove anything and that is you. If YOU change, you
become a very vital argument. If you do not change, just arguing is
useless; you cannot convince anybody. Just reasoning never convinces;
only your being convinces. So do not be argumentative about it.</p><p><br></p><p>This has been my feeling: when you learn something new, you become
argumentative; you go on talking about it. And it is not that you are
doing harm to anybody – you may be simply thinking to help them. When
something is so fresh to you and you have experienced something new, you
want to share it. This is natural. It may be natural but it is not wise
because the other is absolutely unacquainted with what you are talking
about.</p><p><br></p><p>And my methods particularly are so mad that you cannot convince
anybody! Do not try it because if you cannot convince anyone, it may
have a harmful effect on you. Your failure will make you less confident.
Then you will become hesitant within. You cannot convince anybody and
others can convince you that you have gone mad – that you are wrong.
They can convince you because you have had a subtle experience which is
inexpressible. How can you convey it? Unless someone is very welcoming
and receptive, you cannot convey it. To say no to anything is very easy;
to negate is very easy. To be positive, to say yes, is very
difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>Chekhov has written a story. One man in a village was so idiotic, so
stupid, that the whole village knew about it, that he was stupid. And he
himself became so convinced that he was stupid that he became afraid
even to talk, to utter a single word, because the moment he said
anything someone would say, “What a stupid thing you are saying! What a
silly thing.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was so depressed, he went to a sage and asked him, “What to do? I
am such a proved idiot that I cannot even utter a single word. Before I
utter anything, they say, ‘Be silent. Do not speak!’”</p><p><br></p><p>The sage said, “Do one thing: never say yes to anything from now on.
Whatsoever you see, condemn it.”</p><p>The idiot said, “But they will not listen to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The sage said, “Don’t bother. If they say, ‘This is a beautiful
painting,’ say, ‘This painting beautiful? Such an ugly thing I have not
seen before!’ If they say, ‘This novel is very original,’ say, ‘This is
just a repetition. Thousands of times the same story has been written.’
Do not bother to prove it. Simply say no to everything; make it your
basic philosophy. If someone says that the night is beautiful, the moon
is beautiful, say, ‘You call this beauty?’ And they cannot prove
otherwise, remember. They cannot prove!”</p><p><br></p><p>The man went back to his village. He started saying no to everything.
Within a week there was a rumor around the village: “We were wrong. That
man is not an idiot. He is a great critic; he is a genius.”</p><p><br></p><p>To say no needs no wisdom. If you want to become a great genius, say
no, be a critic. Never bother to say yes to anything. Whatsoever anybody
says, deny it flatly. And no one can prove it because to prove anything
is very difficult. ‘No’ is the simplest trick.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are talking of higher experiences, anybody can say no to
you. Any stupid man can say no and you cannot prove otherwise. So be
alert. Do not talk about it unless you feel that a very sympathetic
heart is there to listen, to receive. And do not argue. If something has
happened to you, your being will become the argument. Do not waste any
energy convincing anyone. Use all the energy that you have in
transforming yourself. Your transformation will help many; your argument
can help no one.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you are transformed, people will start falling in love with you.
They will become receptive, inviting; they will become hosts. And
whatsoever you say to them will be received as a seed; they will carry
it in their hearts. But do not try to convince anyone; do not argue; do
not be intellectual and rational about it. The whole phenomenon is so
absurd, it is so paradoxical!</p><p><br></p><p>It is paradoxical because through being consciously mad you go beyond
all madness. A person meditating with this technique cannot go mad. It
is impossible because he is throwing out all madness, not accumulating
it. And unless you accumulate, you cannot be mad.</p><p><br></p><p>You are daily cleansing yourself; you are daily passing through a
catharsis. You are changing – transforming your madness into meditation.
Doing this method, apparently so mad, you will create the possibility
where real sanity will happen to you. This is paradoxical; this is why I
call it absurd.</p><p><br></p><p>Laugh, sing, dance, but do not argue. Your dance can become
infectious, your singing can become infectious. Your laughter, coming
deep from your heart, can penetrate others’ hearts. Be more joyful,
blissful, ecstatic, as if every moment is a blessing and every moment is
a gratitude. And make every moment a celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part16>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/from_darkness_to_light/part17/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>17 Love is a very unscientific idea</span>

BY WHOM IMPELLED DOES THE CHIEF PRANA – VITAL FORCE – PROCEED TO ITS FUNCTION? BY WHOM IMPELLED DO MEN UTTER THIS SPEECH? WHAT DEVA OR GOD DIRECTS THE EYES AND THE EARS?\nIT – THE ATMAN – IS THE EAR OF THE EAR, THE MIND OF THE MIND, THE SPEECH OF THE SPEECH, THE PRANA OF THE PRANA, AND THE EYE OF THE EYE. WISE MEN SEPARATING THE ATMAN FROM THESE – SENSE FUNCTIONS – RISE OUT OF SENSE LIFE AND ATTAIN TO IMMORTALITY.\nLife is not there at its maximum when you are born; it is at its minimum. If you do stick at that, you will have a life which is just near death – just a borderline life. By birth, only an opportunity is given, only an opening is made.\nLife has to be achieved. Birth is just a beginning, not the end. But normally we stay at the point of birth. That is why death happens. If you stay at the point of birth you will die. If you can grow beyond birth you can grow beyond death. Remember this very deeply: death is not against life; death is against birth. Life is something else. In death only birth ends and in birth only death begins. Life is something totally different. You have to attain it, achieve it, actualize it. It is given to you as a seed, just as a potentiality – something which can be but which is not already there.\nYou have every chance of missing it. You can be alive because you are born, but that is not synonymous with really being in life. Life is your effort to actualize the potentiality. Hence, the meaning of religion; otherwise there is no meaning in religion. If life begins with birth and ends in death, then there is no meaning for religion. Then religion is futile, nonsense. If life does not begin with birth, then religion has some meaning. Then it becomes the science of how to evolve life out of birth. And the more you move away from birth in life, the more you move away from death also because death and birth are parallel, similar, the same – two ends of one process. If you move away from the one, you are simultaneously moving away from the other.\nReligion is a science to achieve life. Life is beyond death. Birth dies; life, never. To achieve this life you have to do something. Birth is given to you. Your parents have done something: they have loved each other, they have been melting into each other, and out of their life force, melting into each other, a new phenomenon, a new seed – you – is born. But you have not done anything for it: it is a gift. Remember, birth is a gift. That is why all the cultures pay so much respect to parents – it is a gift, and you cannot repay it. The debt cannot be repaid. What can you do to repay it? Life has been given to you, but you have not done anything for it.\nReligion can give you a new birth, a rebirth. You can be reborn. But this birth will happen through some alchemical change within you. Just as the first birth happened through two life forces meeting without you – they created an opportunity for you to enter, to be born; that is a deep alchemy – so a similar thing has to be done now within you. Your parents met – your mother and your father. Two forces, feminine and masculine, were meeting to create an opportunity for some new thing to be born. Two opposite forces were meeting, two polarities were meeting. And whenever two polarities meet, something new is born, a new synthesis is achieved. A similar thing has to happen within you.\nYou also have two polarities within you, the feminine and the masculine. Let me explain it a little more in detail.… Because your body is born out of two polarities: cells from your mother and cells from your father, they create your body. You have both types of cells – those which came from your mother and those which came from your father. Your body consists of two polarities, feminine and masculine. You are both, everyone is both. Whether you are man or woman it makes no difference. If you are a man you have a woman within you: your mother is there. If you are a woman you have a man within you: your father is there. They can again meet within you. And the whole yoga, the whole tantra, the alchemy, the whole process of religion, is how to create an orgasm, a deep intercourse between the polarities within you. And when they meet within you a new type of being is born, a new life becomes alive.\nIf you are a man, then your conscious is masculine and your unconscious is feminine. If you are a woman your conscious is feminine and your unconscious is masculine. Your conscious and unconscious must meet so that a new birth becomes possible. What to do for their meeting to happen? Bring them nearer. You have created a separation; you have created all types of barriers. You do not allow them to meet. You try to exist with the conscious and you go on suppressing the unconscious. You do not allow it.\nIf a man starts weeping and crying, someone is bound to say immediately, “What are you doing? You are doing something womanish, feminine.” The man stops immediately. The masculine is not expected to weep and cry. But you have the possibility; the unconscious is there. You have moments of feminineness, you have moments of masculineness; everyone does.\nA woman can become ferocious, a male, in some moods, in some moments. But then she will suppress. She will say, “This is not womanlike.” We go on creating a separation, a distance. That distance has to be thrown away; your conscious and unconscious must come nearer. Only then can they meet, only then can they have a deep intercourse. An orgasm can happen WITHIN you. That orgasm is known as spiritual bliss.\nOne type of orgasm is possible between your body and the body of the polar opposite sex; it can happen only for a single moment because you meet only on the periphery. The peripheries meet and then they separate. Another type, a deeper type of orgasm, can happen within. But then you meet at the center and there is no need to separate again. Sexual ecstasy can only be momentary; spiritual ecstasy can be eternal. Once attained you need not lose it. Really, once attained it is difficult to lose it – impossible to lose it. It becomes such an integration that the fragments disappear completely.\nThat is why when someone asked Buddha, “Who are you? A deva, a heavenly being?” he said, “No!” And the questioner went on asking. Then the questioner became desperate because whenever he asked Buddha who he is, if he is this or that, Buddha went on saying, “No!” Then finally he asked, “At least you must say that you are male. You must say yes.” Buddha said, “No!” “Then are you a female?” the man asked desperately. Buddha said, “No!” – because a new unity has come into being which is neither male nor female.\nWhen your inner man and inner woman meet, you are neither: you transcend sex. That is the meaning of the oldest Indian image of Shiva as ARDHANARISHWAR – half man, half woman. That is the symbol of the inner meeting. Shiva is neither now: he is half man, half woman – both and neither. He transcends sex.\nRemember, unless you transcend sex, you cannot transcend duality. This is a deep psychological problem – not only psychological but ontological also. If you remain a man or a woman, how can you conceive of the oneness of existence? You cannot. Being a man, you cannot conceive of yourself being one with a woman. Being a woman, you cannot conceive of yourself being one with a man. A duality persists.\nSex is the basic duality. We have been arguing about and discussing for centuries how to attain the nondual. But we go on discussing it as if it is some intellectual matter: “How to attain the nondual?” It is not an intellectual matter; it is ontological, existential. You can attain the nondual only when the duality within you disappears. It is not a question of meditating on the nondual and thinking, “I am the Brahman.” Nothing will come out of it; you are simply deluding yourself.\nYou cannot attain nonduality unless the basic duality of sex disappears within you, unless you come to a moment when you cannot say who you are – man or woman. And this happens only when your inner man and woman melt so much that they dissolve into each other – and all the boundaries are lost, and all the distinctions are lost, and they are one. When the inner orgasm, the spiritual ecstasy happens, you are neither. And only when you are neither is life born.\nIn a single moment of meeting between your parents, your mother and father, you were born – in a single moment of meeting! Remember, life is always out of meeting, never out of separation. Life comes only in a deep meeting, in a deep communion. For a single moment your father and mother were one, they were not two. They were functioning as one being. In that oneness you were born.\nLife always comes out of oneness. And the life that I am talking about, or Jesus talks about and Buddha talks about, is the life which will happen inside you, within you. Again a communion, a melting, happens, and the two sexualities within you dissolve.\nRemember, I say again and again that sex is the basic duality, and unless you transcend sex the Brahman cannot be achieved. All other dualities are just reflections and reflections of this basic duality. Birth and death – again a duality. They will disappear when you are neither male or female. When you have a consciousness which goes beyond both, birth and death disappear, matter and mind disappear, this world and that world disappear, heaven and hell disappear. All dualities disappear when the basic duality within you disappears, because all dualities are simply echoing and re-echoing the basic division within you.\nThat is why the old, ancient Indian seers have put the Brahman in the third category. He is neither male nor female. They call him NAPUNSAK – impotent. They call him the third sex, the ultimate reality of the third sex. The word brahman belongs to NAPUNSAK LING: it is neither or it is both. But one thing is certain: it transcends the duality. That is why other conceptions of God look immature, childish. Christians call him father. This is childish, because then where is the mother? And how is this son Jesus born? And they say Jesus is the only son but where is the mother? The father alone giving birth? If the father alone gives birth to Jesus, then he is both – mother and father. Then do not call him father. Then the duality comes in.\nOr, some religions have called the ultimate being the mother. Then where is the father? These are just anthropomorphic feelings. Man cannot even think about the ultimate in any other terms than human, so he calls it father or mother. But those who have known and those who have transcended the anthropocentric attitude, the man-oriented attitude – they know that he is neither. He transcends both; he is a meeting of both.\nIn the ultimate, mother and father both are merged. Or, if you will allow me the expression, I would like to say: the Brahman is mother and father in eternal orgasm – one in an eternal ecstasy of meeting. And out of that meeting comes the whole creation, out of that meeting comes the whole play, out of that meeting all that exists is born.\nHere, in this meditation camp, we will be trying to bring your unconscious and conscious nearer, your feminine and your masculine nearer. You will have to help me, to cooperate with me. In the meditation techniques you have to destroy all the barriers between your conscious mind and the unconscious. And you have to be free, as totally free as possible because suppression has created the barriers.\nSo do not suppress. If you feel like screaming, scream. The very scream will bring your conscious and unconscious nearer. If you feel like dancing, dance. The very dance will bring your conscious and unconscious nearer. Really, dance can be very helpful, because in dance your body and your mind are in a deep meeting. It is not only the body which is moving; within the body your consciousness is also moving. Really, a dance becomes a dance only when your body is filled with the grace of your spirit, when your spirit is flowing out of your body, when your spirit has taken a rhythm with the body.\nAll the old religions were dancing religions. They were more authentic. Our new modes of religion are just false. You go into a temple or into a church or into a GURUDWARA and you just verbalize\nthere. Someone preaches and you listen. It has become cerebral. Or, you pray and you talk with God. Even with God you use language. You cannot be silent with him; you cannot believe that he can understand you without your talking. You have no faith! You do not trust him; you want to explain everything to him.\nI have heard: one mother overheard her small child praying in the night to God, and he was saying, “Dear God, beloved God, stop Tommy from throwing things at me – and by the way, I have told you this before.”\nBut this is what we all are doing: praying to God to “stop Tommy from throwing things at me.” Even if you go to the Vedic RISHIS they are doing the same: “Do this; do not do that.” You cannot allow him to do whatsoever is his will. You give your own program. And if he follows you, you are a believer and if he doesn’t follow you you will say that he doesn’t exist. He can exist only if he exists as your follower.\nBut existence cannot follow you. Existence is greater than you; existence is the whole. You are just a fragment, and a fragment cannot be followed – the fragment has to follow the whole. This is what a religious mind is: the fragment following the whole, the fragment surrendering to the whole, the fragment not struggling, the fragment in a letgo.\nReligion has become verbal, linguistic. Here we will try to bring the authentic religion. The secretmost core of it is that you must come to it totally – with your mind, your body, your emotions, everything. Nothing is denied. You cry and you weep and you laugh and you dance, and you sit in silence. You do all the things that your inner being happens to do; you do not force it to do anything. You do not say, “This is not good; I should not do it.” You allow a spontaneous flow. Then the unconscious will come nearer and nearer to the conscious.\nWe have created the gap through suppression: “Don’t do this, don’t do that,” and we go on suppressing. Then the unconscious is suppressed. It becomes dark. It becomes a part where we never move in our own house. Then we are divided. And, remember, then there are perversions.\nIf you allow your unconscious to come nearer to your conscious, too much sex-obsession will disappear. If you are a man and you deny your unconscious, you are denying your inner woman; then you will be attracted to outer women too much. It will become a perversion because then it is a substitute. The inner femininity has been denied; now the outer femininity becomes obsessive to you. You will think and think about it; now your whole mind will become sexual. If you are a woman and you have denied the man, then ‘man’ will take possession of you. Then whatsoever you do or think, the basic color will remain sexual.\nSo much fantasy about sex is because you have denied your inner other. So now this is a compensation. Now you are compensating for something which you have denied to yourself. And look at the absurdity: the more you get obsessed with the other sex the more you feel afraid; the more you deny the inner the more you suppress it; and the more you suppress it the more you become obsessed.\nYour so-called BRAHMACHARIS are totally obsessed with sex for twenty-four hours a day; they are bound to be. It is natural: nature takes revenge. To me, BRAHMACHARYA – celibacy – means you\nhave come so near to your own feminine or your own masculine, so near that there is no substitution for it. You are not obsessed with it; you do not think about it. It disappears.\nWhen your own unconscious is nearer to you, you need not substitute it with someone else outside. And then a miracle happens. If your unconscious is so near, then whenever you love someone, a woman or a man, that love is not pathological. If your unconscious is so near, that love is not pathological. It is not possessive, it is not mad. It is very silent, tranquil, calm, cool. Then the other is not a substitute and you are not dependent on the other. Rather, the other becomes just a mirror.\nRemember the difference: the other is not now a substitute, something which you have denied. The other becomes a mirror of your inner part, of your unconscious. Your wife, your beloved, becomes just a mirror. In that mirror you see your unconscious. Your lover, your husband, your friend, becomes a mirror. And in that mirror you can see your unconscious clearly mirrored, projected outside. Then wife and husband can help each other to bring their unconscious more and more near.\nAnd a moment comes, and it must come if life has been a really successful effort, when wife and husband are no more wife and husband: they have become companions on the eternal journey. They help each other; they have become mirrors to each other. They reveal the unconscious of the other and each helps the other to know himself or herself. Now there is no pathology, no dependence.\nRemember one thing more: if you deny your unconscious, if you hate your unconscious, if you suppress your woman or man within, then you can go on saying that you love the outer woman but deep down you will hate her also. If you deny your own woman, you will hate the woman you love. If you deny your own man, you will hate the man you love. Your love will just be on the surface. Deep down it will be a hatred. It is bound to be so, it has to be so, because you will not allow the other to become the mirror of your unconscious. And you will be afraid also. Man is afraid of woman. Go and ask your so-called saints. They are so afraid of women. Why? They are afraid of the unconscious, and the woman becomes a mirror. Whatsoever they have hidden, she reveals.\nIf you have suppressed something, then the other polar opposite can reveal it immediately. If you have been suppressing sex and you are sitting in meditation in a lonely place and a beautiful woman passes by, suddenly your unconscious will assert itself. That which has been hidden will be revealed in the woman passing and you will be against that woman. You are foolish – because that woman is not doing anything at all, she is just passing there. She may not even know that you are there; she is not doing anything to you. She is a mirror, but the mirror is passing and in that mirror your unconscious is reflected.\nThe whole so-called spirituality is based on fear. What is the fear? The fear is that the other can reveal the unconscious and you do not want to know anything about it. But not knowing will not help, suppression will not help. It will remain there. It will become a cancer and by and by it will assert itself more and more, and ultimately you will come to feel that you have been a failure and that whatsoever you have suppressed has become victorious and you are defeated.\nMy whole effort is to bring your unconscious nearer to your conscious. You become so much acquainted with it so that it is not unknown. You become friendly to it, then the fear disappears\n– the fear of the polar opposite. And then the hatred also disappears because then the other is just a mirror, helpful. You feel gratitude. Lovers will be grateful to each other if the unconscious is not suppressed and they will be hateful to each other if the unconscious is suppressed.\nAllow your whole being to come into function. Your emotions are imprisoned, encapsulated. Your body movements are imprisoned. Your body, your heart, have become just as if they are not part of you. You simply carry them along like a burden. Allow your emotions full play. In the meditations we will be doing, allow your emotions full play and enjoy the play, because many new things will be revealed to you.\nYou have not been screaming. You have not screamed; you cannot remember when you last screamed. When the scream comes to you and takes possession of you, you will become afraid of what is happening because then you are losing control. But lose control: your control is the poison. Lose control completely. Allow your emotions to erupt like a volcano. You will be surprised at what is hidden in you. You may not even be able to recognize that it is your face.\nAllow your body to have full play also, so that every cell of the body becomes vibrant, alive. Just as a bird alights on a branch and the branch starts wavering – becomes vibrant, alive – let your being alight on your body and allow your body to be vibrant, alive, alive with the inner force. And suddenly you will enter a new door unknown before. You will open a new dimension of your own existence and that dimension will lead you to the ultimate, to the divine.\nNow the sutra:\nAT WHOSE DESIRE AND BY WHOM IMPELLED DOES THE MIND ALIGHT ON ITS OBJECTS? BY WHOM IMPELLED DOES THE CHIEF PRANA – VITAL FORCE – PROCEED TO ITS FUNCTION? BY WHOM IMPELLED DO MEN UTTER THIS SPEECH? WHAT DEVA OR GOD DIRECTS THE EYES AND THE EARS?\nThe master is asking what is the original source in you – of your entire life, of all your movements, of all your expressions. What force creates desire? What force impels you to be alive? What force gives you the lust for life? There must be a hidden force, in a way inexhaustible: it goes on and on; it never tires.\nAT WHOSE DESIRE AND BY WHOM IMPELLED DOES THE MIND ALIGHT ON ITS OBJECTS?\nWhen you look at a beautiful woman or a beautiful flower or a beautiful sunset, who impels you? Who throws you outward? Who is the inner source of all your activity?\nThe Upanishads say that whatsoever you do, the doer is always the Brahman – WHATSOEVER you do, you are not the doer. The doer is always the Brahman. If you run after a woman filled with lust the Upanishads say it is also the Brahman. Because of this, Christian missionaries could never understand what type of religion Hinduism is. Even lust is spiritual because the original source is always the Brahman. Whatsoever you do with your energy, he is moving in it.\nThere is a storyThe god Brahma created the world and he fell in love with it. Christian theologians\ncannot understand it. Naturally, it is difficult to understand. Brahma goes on creating other beings\nand he goes on falling in love with them! He creates a cow and he falls in love and becomes the bull – and on and on, until the whole creation is created. He creates the cow and he becomes the bull. He goes on dividing himself into two polar opposites.\nThe story is just beautiful, if you can understand it. He goes on dividing himself into two polar opposites. And remember, the reverse is the process to reach him again. Go on nondividing; go on meeting with the polar opposite. He creates the world through polar opposites. He creates the cow but he is the cow because he creates the cow out of himself. Then he creates the bull but he is the bull. He is both the feminine and the masculine.\nThen he follows the cow, and the cow tries to escape the bull. The cow tries to hide and through her hiding she invites the bull. This is a hide-and-seek. That is why Hindus say the whole creation is just a play – a play of the same energy dividing itself into polar opposites and then playing hide-and-seek.\nYou are the Brahman. Your husband is the Brahman; your wife is the Brahman. And the Brahman is playing hide-and-seek. The whole idea is simply superb. The reverse is the process to reach the ultimate again: do not play hide-and-seek. Allow the divided parts to mingle into each other. Let them merge, and the Brahman arises again – the one.\nThis master asks:\nAT WHOSE DESIRE AND BY WHOM IMPELLED DOES THE MIND ALIGHT ON ITS OBJECTS? BY WHOM IMPELLED DOES THE CHIEF PRANA – VITAL FORCE – PROCEED TO ITS FUNCTION? – who breathes in you? BY WHOM IMPELLED DO MEN UTTER THIS SPEECH?\n– who speaks in you? WHAT DEVA OR GOD DIRECTS THE EYES AND EARS? – who is directing your senses?\nThe Upanishads are not against the senses. They are spiritually sensuous; they do not deny. Denial is not their slogan at all, denial is not their attitude. They accept and they say that even in the senses the divine is moving because there is nothing else to move. They make everything sacred, they make everything holy. They do not condemn, they do not say this is sin. Sin is unknown to the Upanishads, absolutely unknown. They say there is no sin – that everything is a play. Even in sin, even in the sinner, the same energy is moving.\nEverything becomes holy. And if you can say with your full heart that everything is holy, holy, holy, YOU will become holy immediately because the very feeling that everything is holy and sacred makes the sin disappear. Sin is created by condemnation and the more you condemn, the more sinners you create.\nThe whole world has become a great crowd of sinners because everything has been condemned\n– everything! There is not a single thing which you can do which has not been condemned by someone or other. With everything condemned, you become a sinner. Then guilt arises – and when there is guilt you can pray but the prayer is poisonous; it comes out of your guilt. When you are guilty you can pray but that prayer is based on fear. That prayer is not love; it cannot be. Through guilt love is impossible. Feeling yourself condemned, a sinner, how can you love?\nThe Upanishads say that everything is holy because he is the source of all. Whether or not the river looks dirty to you is irrelevant. He is the source of all – the dirty river and the sacred Ganges, to both\nhe gives the energy. To the sinner to the saint, he gives the energy. Really, there is no story like this but I would like a story like this: he created the sinner, then he became the saint, just like the cow and the bull, and then the hide-and-seek. He created the saint and then he became the sinner and then the hide-and-seek.…\nHave total acceptance of whatsoever exists. Just by being in existence, it is holy.\nIT – THE ATMAN, or the Brahman – IS THE EAR OF THE EAR, THE MIND OF THE MIND, THE SPEECH OF THE SPEECH, THE PRANA OF THE PRANA, AND THE EYE OF THE EYE. WISE MEN SEPARATING THE ATMAN FROM THESE – SENSE FUNCTIONS – RISE OUT OF SENSE LIFE AND ATTAIN TO IMMORTALITY.\nWhatsoever you do it is him – it is the functioning of him, of the total. The total functions in you. When you breathe, what do you do? You do nothing. The breathing comes in and goes out. Rather, he breathes in you; you cannot do anything. If the breath leaves you, what will you do? If it doesn’t come back, what will you do? If it has left then it has left and if it does not come back you cannot do anything. Really, when it is not coming you are no more. Who is there to do anything? He breathes, not you. The emphasis is on the total, not on the individual.\nThis has to be constantly remembered, because we go on forgetting this. Our emphasis is on the individual, the I: “I am breathing, I am alive, I am seeing you.” No! The master says he – the Brahman – is seeing through the eyes, he is the eye of the eye. When I speak, I am not speaking: he speaks. And when you listen, YOU are not listening: he listens. He becomes the cow, he becomes the bull; he becomes the speaker, he becomes the listener. It is a mysterious hide-and-seek, a great play, a great drama, beautiful, if you can understand. He is everywhere – in the listener, in the speaker, he is EVERYWHERE! And when you are silent, he is silent within you. When you speak, he is speaking in you.\nThis emphasis is not only metaphysical, not only a doctrine. As a doctrine also it is superb. But it is to help you toward a new realization. While speaking, if you can feel he is speaking, all the fever in it will be lost. While fighting, if you can remember that he is fighting through you, the fight will become a drama. While being silent, feel he is silent within you. And if the silence is disturbed and thoughts start moving, you know that he is disturbed, not you. He has become the thoughts and now he is moving like clouds in your inner sky. He is both, so why be worried? He is both!\nWhen you are healthy he is healthy in you and when you are ill he is ill in you. You are totally unworried; you need not come in. Your whole burden has been thrown upon him. That is why I say this is not only metaphysical. It is one of the deepest techniques to transform your total being.\nIf he is doing everything, then why do you go on carrying yourself unnecessarily? He breathes and he is born and he dies. When you die, he will die – not you. Then why be afraid of death? You become unconcerned. This unconcern relieves you of all burden. And this is the actual fact; this is not a make-believe. This is the actual fact: whatsoever is happening is happening to the total. The individual is just an illusion.\nI have never been as an ego and I am not as an ego, and I cannot be; only he is. And when I say he, I mean the total. Do not try to conceive of him as a person. He is not a person; he is the total –\nthe whole. That which breathes in you breathes in the trees and that which sings in you sings in the birds and that which dances in you dances in the rivers, in the brooks, in the springs, and that which speaks in you speaks in the breeze passing through the trees. The total!\nJust change the gestalt, just change the pattern. Do not emphasize the individual; move to the total. Then what is the problem? Then there is no problem. With YOU enters every type of problem; with YOU enters anguish and anxiety. Without any burden on you, you are liberated. You can become a MUKTA, a liberated one, you can become a SIDDHA, this very moment. Just by realizing, feeling that “I am not and he is,” the past disappears and the future is no more because the future is created out of your worries, imagination, projections. Then he will take care. Then whatsoever happens will happen and whatsoever happens will be good because it is out of him.\nThis is what trust is. It is not that you believe in a God sitting upon some throne in heaven and guiding everyone from there, a great controller, an engineer or something like that – no! He is not the managing director. He is not! There is neither any throne nor someone sitting on it. And faith doesn’t mean that you believe in a concept, in a philosophy. Faith means trust – trusting the whole. Then everything is blissful. How can anything else be? How can anything other than bliss be? You create misery because YOU come in. Go out just as if a lamp has been put out. Go out... and then he is.\nIT IS THE EAR OF THE EAR, THE MIND OF THE MIND, THE SPEECH OF THE SPEECH, THE PRANA OF THE PRANA, AND THE EYE OF THE EYE.\nWhatsoever appears on the surface, whatsoever it is, makes no difference. Always, hidden, he is there. Look at me with full remembrance, with mindfulness that he is looking through you, and immediately the quality of consciousness changes. Just now look at me: he is looking, he is the eye of the eye, and immediately you are not there and a tremendous silence happens. The very quality of your being is different when you look at me as if he is looking and not you.\nYou are listening to me: forget that I am here; he is here – the total. The total has taken possession of me, the total has become active in me, the total has changed me into his instrument. Look at me as if he is speaking, listen to me as if he is speaking, and then everything is different. You are no more there... a sudden flash and everything changes. It is not a question of time. You are not to practice it, you can see it this very moment.\nLook at me! You are not there; the total, the whole, has become the eyes; the whole has become the eyes in you. You are just an expression of the will of the whole, of the desire of the whole. The whole has become words through me, he is manipulating me, he is using me. And then, in this room, only he is. Then the totality becomes one. Then the parts are lost and the fragments are no more and there is a deep orgasm between the speaker and listener. Then you will feel the presence but the presence can come only if you forget yourself.\nRemembering God is not really a remembering of his name. Remembering God is not to go on chanting “Rama, Rama, Krishna, Krishna”; that is useless, futile. Remembering him means forgetfulness of yourself. If you are not, if you are forgotten, completely forgetful of yourself, abandoned, he is. When you are not, suddenly he is – and this can happen in a single moment.\nI am reminded that after the second world war it happened in a small village in England that there was a statue of Jesus just on the crossroads – a beautiful statue with raised hands. And on the statue there was a plate, and on that plate it was written: Come unto me.\nIn the second world war the statue was destroyed; a bomb fell upon it. And when there was restoration work and the village was again coming to be alive after the war, they remembered the statue, so they tried to find fragments of it. In the ruins the fragments were found and the statue was restored again. But the hands could not be found. They were missing.\nSo the village council decided to ask the artist to make new hands. But one old man in the village who was always seen sitting near the statue – both when it was there and when it was not – said, “No! Let Jesus be without hands.”\nThe council said, “Then what will we do about the plate underneath? It is written, ‘Come unto me!’ and it had raised hands.”\nThe old man said, “Change the plate and write there, ‘Come unto me. I have no other hands than your own.’”\nAnd now the statue stands there without the hands, and written underneath is: Come unto me. I have no other hands than yours.\nIn your hands he is moving, in your eyes he is moving, and in your heart he is beating – the total. And he has no other hands, remember. He has no other eyes, he has no other heart to beat. He is beating all over, he is alive all over. This is the message.\nIT IS THE EAR OF THE EAR, THE MIND OF THE MIND, THE SPEECH OF THE SPEECH, THE PRANA OF THE PRANA, AND THE EYE OF THE EYE. WISE MEN SEPARATING THE ATMAN FROM THESE – SENSE FUNCTIONS – RISE OUT OF SENSE LIFE AND ATTAIN TO IMMORTALITY.\nAll these senses are the functions and he is the functionary within. Knowing this, you are not against the senses. Knowing this, you simply change the emphasis. Then you are not obsessed with the senses; you are always looking for the inner core. And the rishis say that by knowing this transcendence they attain immortality. Remember, only YOU can die; life never dies. Because you are born, you will die; that is the natural end to every birth. Life goes on... eternally moving; life never dies. Waves in it are born and they die, and the riverlike life moves and moves and moves.\nOnce you come to feel the river within your wave, you are immortal. If you can realize him seeing through you, breathing through you, you are immortal. Only this shell, this vehicle of the body, will disappear. YOU will never disappear. You cannot disappear – you have always been.\nSometimes you were a tree because the tree was the vehicle – because he willed to be a tree through you. Sometimes you were a cow because he willed himself to be a cow through you. Sometimes you were a butterfly, sometimes a flower, sometimes a rock... but you have always been here. You have ALWAYS been here! You are not a new visitor. No one is a new visitor; no one is a stranger. You have always been here and now but with different vehicles. Sometimes a rock was the vehicle; now you are a man or a woman: now this is a vehicle.\nIf you can understand and KNOW that the vehicle is just the vehicle, the vehicle can be changed. It will have to be changed. But the inner one who goes on changing faces remains the same. That one is immortal, life is immortal. You are mortal. And why are you mortal? – because you become identified with the vehicle. Moving in a cart you become the cart. Riding on the train you become the train. Flying in an aircraft you become the aircraft. You go on forgetting that the aircraft, the cart, the train, the car, they are vehicles.\nYou are not the vehicles; you are the total, and the total goes on changing its vehicles. Then you are immortal. Remember, you cannot be immortal if you are identified with the body. You are immortal knowing, transcending the body. The consciousness is immortal, the very aliveness is immortal.\nThe sutra says:\nWISE MEN, TRANSCENDING THESE – SENSE FUNCTIONS – RISE OUT OF SENSE LIFE AND ATTAIN TO IMMORTALITY.\nAnd the more you feel the inner, the essential, the eternal, the immortal, the less and less you are obsessed with the sense life. You can play it but you are not obsessed.\nKrishna playing on his flute is not obsessed with the flute; Krishna dancing with his girlfriends, the GOPIS, is not obsessed. It is just a play. Life becomes a play, not an obsession, when you know the immortal.\nNow get ready for the meditation.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6901","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_supreme_doctrine/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_supreme_doctrine/>The Supreme Doctrine</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">2 Transcending the Basic Duality of Sex</h1><div class=post-meta>33 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6901 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Supreme_Doctrine/part2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

GOD DIRECTS THE EYES AND THE EARS?</p><p><br></p><p>IT – THE ATMAN – IS THE EAR OF THE EAR, THE MIND OF THE MIND, THE
SPEECH OF THE SPEECH, THE PRANA OF THE PRANA, AND THE EYE OF THE EYE.
WISE MEN SEPARATING THE ATMAN FROM THESE – SENSE FUNCTIONS – RISE OUT OF
SENSE LIFE AND ATTAIN TO IMMORTALITY.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is not there at its maximum when you are born; it is at its
minimum. If you do stick at that, you will have a life which is just
near death – just a borderline life. By birth, only an opportunity is
given, only an opening is made.</p><p><br></p><p>Life has to be achieved. Birth is just a beginning, not the end. But
normally we stay at the point of birth. That is why death happens. If
you stay at the point of birth you will die. If you can grow beyond
birth you can grow beyond death. Remember this very deeply: death is not
against life; death is against birth. Life is something else. In death
only birth ends and in birth only death begins. Life is something
totally different. You have to attain it, achieve it, actualize it. It
is given to you as a seed, just as a potentiality – something which can
be but which is not already there.</p><p>You have every chance of missing it. You can be alive because you are
born, but that is not synonymous with really being in life. Life is your
effort to actualize the potentiality. Hence, the meaning of religion;
otherwise there is no meaning in religion. If life begins with birth and
ends in death, then there is no meaning for religion. Then religion is
futile, nonsense. If life does not begin with birth, then religion has
some meaning. Then it becomes the science of how to evolve life out of
birth. And the more you move away from birth in life, the more you move
away from death also because death and birth are parallel, similar, the
same – two ends of one process. If you move away from the one, you are
simultaneously moving away from the other.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is a science to achieve life. Life is beyond death. Birth
dies; life, never. To achieve this life you have to do something. Birth
is given to you. Your parents have done something: they have loved each
other, they have been melting into each other, and out of their life
force, melting into each other, a new phenomenon, a new seed – you – is
born. But you have not done anything for it: it is a gift. Remember,
birth is a gift. That is why all the cultures pay so much respect to
parents – it is a gift, and you cannot repay it. The debt cannot be
repaid. What can you do to repay it? Life has been given to you, but you
have not done anything for it.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion can give you a new birth, a rebirth. You can be reborn. But
this birth will happen through some alchemical change within you. Just
as the first birth happened through two life forces meeting without you
– they created an opportunity for you to enter, to be born; that is a
deep alchemy – so a similar thing has to be done now within you. Your
parents met – your mother and your father. Two forces, feminine and
masculine, were meeting to create an opportunity for some new thing to
be born. Two opposite forces were meeting, two polarities were meeting.
And whenever two polarities meet, something new is born, a new synthesis
is achieved. A similar thing has to happen within you.</p><p><br></p><p>You also have two polarities within you, the feminine and the
masculine. Let me explain it a little more in detail.… Because your body
is born out of two polarities: cells from your mother and cells from
your father, they create your body. You have both types of cells – those
which came from your mother and those which came from your father. Your
body consists of two polarities, feminine and masculine. You are both,
everyone is both. Whether you are man or woman it makes no difference.
If you are a man you have a woman within you: your mother is there. If
you are a woman you have a man within you: your father is there. They
can again meet within you. And the whole yoga, the whole tantra, the
alchemy, the whole process of religion, is how to create an orgasm, a
deep intercourse between the polarities within you. And when they meet
within you a new type of being is born, a new life becomes alive.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are a man, then your conscious is masculine and your
unconscious is feminine. If you are a woman your conscious is feminine
and your unconscious is masculine. Your conscious and unconscious must
meet so that a new birth becomes possible. What to do for their meeting
to happen? Bring them nearer. You have created a separation; you have
created all types of barriers. You do not allow them to meet. You try to
exist with the conscious and you go on suppressing the unconscious. You
do not allow it.</p><p><br></p><p>If a man starts weeping and crying, someone is bound to say
immediately, “What are you doing? You are doing something womanish,
feminine.” The man stops immediately. The masculine is not expected to
weep and cry. But you have the possibility; the unconscious is there.
You have moments of feminineness, you have moments of masculineness;
everyone does.</p><p>A woman can become ferocious, a male, in some moods, in some moments.
But then she will suppress. She will say, “This is not womanlike.” We go
on creating a separation, a distance. That distance has to be thrown
away; your conscious and unconscious must come nearer. Only then can
they meet, only then can they have a deep intercourse. An orgasm can
happen WITHIN you. That orgasm is known as spiritual bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>One type of orgasm is possible between your body and the body of the
polar opposite sex; it can happen only for a single moment because you
meet only on the periphery. The peripheries meet and then they separate.
Another type, a deeper type of orgasm, can happen within. But then you
meet at the center and there is no need to separate again. Sexual
ecstasy can only be momentary; spiritual ecstasy can be eternal. Once
attained you need not lose it. Really, once attained it is difficult to
lose it – impossible to lose it. It becomes such an integration that the
fragments disappear completely.</p><p><br></p><p>That is why when someone asked Buddha, “Who are you? A deva, a
heavenly being?” he said, “No!” And the questioner went on asking. Then
the questioner became desperate because whenever he asked Buddha who he
is, if he is this or that, Buddha went on saying, “No!” Then finally he
asked, “At least you must say that you are male. You must say yes.”
Buddha said, “No!” “Then are you a female?” the man asked desperately.
Buddha said, “No!” – because a new unity has come into being which is
neither male nor female.</p><p><br></p><p>When your inner man and inner woman meet, you are neither: you
transcend sex. That is the meaning of the oldest Indian image of Shiva
as ARDHANARISHWAR – half man, half woman. That is the symbol of the
inner meeting. Shiva is neither now: he is half man, half woman – both
and neither. He transcends sex.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, unless you transcend sex, you cannot transcend duality.
This is a deep psychological problem – not only psychological but
ontological also. If you remain a man or a woman, how can you conceive
of the oneness of existence? You cannot. Being a man, you cannot
conceive of yourself being one with a woman. Being a woman, you cannot
conceive of yourself being one with a man. A duality persists.</p><p><br></p><p>Sex is the basic duality. We have been arguing about and discussing
for centuries how to attain the nondual. But we go on discussing it as
if it is some intellectual matter: “How to attain the nondual?” It is
not an intellectual matter; it is ontological, existential. You can
attain the nondual only when the duality within you disappears. It is
not a question of meditating on the nondual and thinking, “I am the
Brahman.” Nothing will come out of it; you are simply deluding
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot attain nonduality unless the basic duality of sex
disappears within you, unless you come to a moment when you cannot say
who you are – man or woman. And this happens only when your inner man
and woman melt so much that they dissolve into each other – and all the
boundaries are lost, and all the distinctions are lost, and they are
one. When the inner orgasm, the spiritual ecstasy happens, you are
neither. And only when you are neither is life born.</p><p><br></p><p>In a single moment of meeting between your parents, your mother and
father, you were born – in a single moment of meeting! Remember, life is
always out of meeting, never out of separation. Life comes only in a
deep meeting, in a deep communion. For a single moment your father and
mother were one, they were not two. They were functioning as one being.
In that oneness you were born.</p><p>Life always comes out of oneness. And the life that I am talking
about, or Jesus talks about and Buddha talks about, is the life which
will happen inside you, within you. Again a communion, a melting,
happens, and the two sexualities within you dissolve.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, I say again and again that sex is the basic duality, and
unless you transcend sex the Brahman cannot be achieved. All other
dualities are just reflections and reflections of this basic duality.
Birth and death – again a duality. They will disappear when you are
neither male or female. When you have a consciousness which goes beyond
both, birth and death disappear, matter and mind disappear, this world
and that world disappear, heaven and hell disappear. All dualities
disappear when the basic duality within you disappears, because all
dualities are simply echoing and re-echoing the basic division within
you.</p><p><br></p><p>That is why the old, ancient Indian seers have put the Brahman in the
third category. He is neither male nor female. They call him NAPUNSAK –
impotent. They call him the third sex, the ultimate reality of the third
sex. The word brahman belongs to NAPUNSAK LING: it is neither or it is
both. But one thing is certain: it transcends the duality. That is why
other conceptions of God look immature, childish. Christians call him
father. This is childish, because then where is the mother? And how is
this son Jesus born? And they say Jesus is the only son but where is the
mother? The father alone giving birth? If the father alone gives birth
to Jesus, then he is both – mother and father. Then do not call him
father. Then the duality comes in.</p><p><br></p><p>Or, some religions have called the ultimate being the mother. Then
where is the father? These are just anthropomorphic feelings. Man cannot
even think about the ultimate in any other terms than human, so he calls
it father or mother. But those who have known and those who have
transcended the anthropocentric attitude, the man-oriented attitude –
they know that he is neither. He transcends both; he is a meeting of
both.</p><p><br></p><p>In the ultimate, mother and father both are merged. Or, if you will
allow me the expression, I would like to say: the Brahman is mother and
father in eternal orgasm – one in an eternal ecstasy of meeting. And out
of that meeting comes the whole creation, out of that meeting comes the
whole play, out of that meeting all that exists is born.</p><p><br></p><p>Here, in this meditation camp, we will be trying to bring your
unconscious and conscious nearer, your feminine and your masculine
nearer. You will have to help me, to cooperate with me. In the
meditation techniques you have to destroy all the barriers between your
conscious mind and the unconscious. And you have to be free, as totally
free as possible because suppression has created the barriers.</p><p><br></p><p>So do not suppress. If you feel like screaming, scream. The very
scream will bring your conscious and unconscious nearer. If you feel
like dancing, dance. The very dance will bring your conscious and
unconscious nearer. Really, dance can be very helpful, because in dance
your body and your mind are in a deep meeting. It is not only the body
which is moving; within the body your consciousness is also moving.
Really, a dance becomes a dance only when your body is filled with the
grace of your spirit, when your spirit is flowing out of your body, when
your spirit has taken a rhythm with the body.</p><p><br></p><p>All the old religions were dancing religions. They were more
authentic. Our new modes of religion are just false. You go into a
temple or into a church or into a GURUDWARA and you just verbalize</p><p>there. Someone preaches and you listen. It has become cerebral. Or,
you pray and you talk with God. Even with God you use language. You
cannot be silent with him; you cannot believe that he can understand you
without your talking. You have no faith! You do not trust him; you want
to explain everything to him.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard: one mother overheard her small child praying in the
night to God, and he was saying, “Dear God, beloved God, stop Tommy from
throwing things at me – and by the way, I have told you this
before.”</p><p><br></p><p>But this is what we all are doing: praying to God to “stop Tommy from
throwing things at me.” Even if you go to the Vedic RISHIS they are
doing the same: “Do this; do not do that.” You cannot allow him to do
whatsoever is his will. You give your own program. And if he follows
you, you are a believer and if he doesn’t follow you you will say that
he doesn’t exist. He can exist only if he exists as your follower.</p><p><br></p><p>But existence cannot follow you. Existence is greater than you;
existence is the whole. You are just a fragment, and a fragment cannot
be followed – the fragment has to follow the whole. This is what a
religious mind is: the fragment following the whole, the fragment
surrendering to the whole, the fragment not struggling, the fragment in
a letgo.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion has become verbal, linguistic. Here we will try to bring the
authentic religion. The secretmost core of it is that you must come to
it totally – with your mind, your body, your emotions, everything.
Nothing is denied. You cry and you weep and you laugh and you dance, and
you sit in silence. You do all the things that your inner being happens
to do; you do not force it to do anything. You do not say, “This is not
good; I should not do it.” You allow a spontaneous flow. Then the
unconscious will come nearer and nearer to the conscious.</p><p><br></p><p>We have created the gap through suppression: “Don’t do this, don’t do
that,” and we go on suppressing. Then the unconscious is suppressed. It
becomes dark. It becomes a part where we never move in our own house.
Then we are divided. And, remember, then there are perversions.</p><p><br></p><p>If you allow your unconscious to come nearer to your conscious, too
much sex-obsession will disappear. If you are a man and you deny your
unconscious, you are denying your inner woman; then you will be
attracted to outer women too much. It will become a perversion because
then it is a substitute. The inner femininity has been denied; now the
outer femininity becomes obsessive to you. You will think and think
about it; now your whole mind will become sexual. If you are a woman and
you have denied the man, then ‘man’ will take possession of you. Then
whatsoever you do or think, the basic color will remain sexual.</p><p><br></p><p>So much fantasy about sex is because you have denied your inner
other. So now this is a compensation. Now you are compensating for
something which you have denied to yourself. And look at the absurdity:
the more you get obsessed with the other sex the more you feel afraid;
the more you deny the inner the more you suppress it; and the more you
suppress it the more you become obsessed.</p><p><br></p><p>Your so-called BRAHMACHARIS are totally obsessed with sex for
twenty-four hours a day; they are bound to be. It is natural: nature
takes revenge. To me, BRAHMACHARYA – celibacy – means you</p><p>have come so near to your own feminine or your own masculine, so near
that there is no substitution for it. You are not obsessed with it; you
do not think about it. It disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>When your own unconscious is nearer to you, you need not substitute
it with someone else outside. And then a miracle happens. If your
unconscious is so near, then whenever you love someone, a woman or a
man, that love is not pathological. If your unconscious is so near, that
love is not pathological. It is not possessive, it is not mad. It is
very silent, tranquil, calm, cool. Then the other is not a substitute
and you are not dependent on the other. Rather, the other becomes just a
mirror.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember the difference: the other is not now a substitute, something
which you have denied. The other becomes a mirror of your inner part, of
your unconscious. Your wife, your beloved, becomes just a mirror. In
that mirror you see your unconscious. Your lover, your husband, your
friend, becomes a mirror. And in that mirror you can see your
unconscious clearly mirrored, projected outside. Then wife and husband
can help each other to bring their unconscious more and more near.</p><p><br></p><p>And a moment comes, and it must come if life has been a really
successful effort, when wife and husband are no more wife and husband:
they have become companions on the eternal journey. They help each
other; they have become mirrors to each other. They reveal the
unconscious of the other and each helps the other to know himself or
herself. Now there is no pathology, no dependence.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember one thing more: if you deny your unconscious, if you hate
your unconscious, if you suppress your woman or man within, then you can
go on saying that you love the outer woman but deep down you will hate
her also. If you deny your own woman, you will hate the woman you love.
If you deny your own man, you will hate the man you love. Your love will
just be on the surface. Deep down it will be a hatred. It is bound to be
so, it has to be so, because you will not allow the other to become the
mirror of your unconscious. And you will be afraid also. Man is afraid
of woman. Go and ask your so-called saints. They are so afraid of women.
Why? They are afraid of the unconscious, and the woman becomes a mirror.
Whatsoever they have hidden, she reveals.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have suppressed something, then the other polar opposite can
reveal it immediately. If you have been suppressing sex and you are
sitting in meditation in a lonely place and a beautiful woman passes by,
suddenly your unconscious will assert itself. That which has been hidden
will be revealed in the woman passing and you will be against that
woman. You are foolish – because that woman is not doing anything at
all, she is just passing there. She may not even know that you are
there; she is not doing anything to you. She is a mirror, but the mirror
is passing and in that mirror your unconscious is reflected.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole so-called spirituality is based on fear. What is the fear?
The fear is that the other can reveal the unconscious and you do not
want to know anything about it. But not knowing will not help,
suppression will not help. It will remain there. It will become a cancer
and by and by it will assert itself more and more, and ultimately you
will come to feel that you have been a failure and that whatsoever you
have suppressed has become victorious and you are defeated.</p><p><br></p><p>My whole effort is to bring your unconscious nearer to your
conscious. You become so much acquainted with it so that it is not
unknown. You become friendly to it, then the fear disappears</p><p>– the fear of the polar opposite. And then the hatred also disappears
because then the other is just a mirror, helpful. You feel gratitude.
Lovers will be grateful to each other if the unconscious is not
suppressed and they will be hateful to each other if the unconscious is
suppressed.</p><p><br></p><p>Allow your whole being to come into function. Your emotions are
imprisoned, encapsulated. Your body movements are imprisoned. Your body,
your heart, have become just as if they are not part of you. You simply
carry them along like a burden. Allow your emotions full play. In the
meditations we will be doing, allow your emotions full play and enjoy
the play, because many new things will be revealed to you.</p><p><br></p><p>You have not been screaming. You have not screamed; you cannot
remember when you last screamed. When the scream comes to you and takes
possession of you, you will become afraid of what is happening because
then you are losing control. But lose control: your control is the
poison. Lose control completely. Allow your emotions to erupt like a
volcano. You will be surprised at what is hidden in you. You may not
even be able to recognize that it is your face.</p><p><br></p><p>Allow your body to have full play also, so that every cell of the
body becomes vibrant, alive. Just as a bird alights on a branch and the
branch starts wavering – becomes vibrant, alive – let your being alight
on your body and allow your body to be vibrant, alive, alive with the
inner force. And suddenly you will enter a new door unknown before. You
will open a new dimension of your own existence and that dimension will
lead you to the ultimate, to the divine.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the sutra:</p><p><br></p><p>AT WHOSE DESIRE AND BY WHOM IMPELLED DOES THE MIND ALIGHT ON ITS
OBJECTS? BY WHOM IMPELLED DOES THE CHIEF PRANA – VITAL FORCE – PROCEED
TO ITS FUNCTION? BY WHOM IMPELLED DO MEN UTTER THIS SPEECH? WHAT DEVA OR
GOD DIRECTS THE EYES AND THE EARS?</p><p><br></p><p>The master is asking what is the original source in you – of your
entire life, of all your movements, of all your expressions. What force
creates desire? What force impels you to be alive? What force gives you
the lust for life? There must be a hidden force, in a way inexhaustible:
it goes on and on; it never tires.</p><p><br></p><p>AT WHOSE DESIRE AND BY WHOM IMPELLED DOES THE MIND ALIGHT ON ITS
OBJECTS?</p><p><br></p><p>When you look at a beautiful woman or a beautiful flower or a
beautiful sunset, who impels you? Who throws you outward? Who is the
inner source of all your activity?</p><p><br></p><p>The Upanishads say that whatsoever you do, the doer is always the
Brahman – WHATSOEVER you do, you are not the doer. The doer is always
the Brahman. If you run after a woman filled with lust the Upanishads
say it is also the Brahman. Because of this, Christian missionaries
could never understand what type of religion Hinduism is. Even lust is
spiritual because the original source is always the Brahman. Whatsoever
you do with your energy, he is moving in it.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a story<span class=s4></span>The god Brahma created the
world and he fell in love with it. Christian theologians</p><p>cannot understand it. Naturally, it is difficult to understand.
Brahma goes on creating other beings</p><p>and he goes on falling in love with them! He creates a cow and he
falls in love and becomes the bull – and on and on, until the whole
creation is created. He creates the cow and he becomes the bull. He goes
on dividing himself into two polar opposites.</p><p><br></p><p>The story is just beautiful, if you can understand it. He goes on
dividing himself into two polar opposites. And remember, the reverse is
the process to reach him again. Go on nondividing; go on meeting with
the polar opposite. He creates the world through polar opposites. He
creates the cow but he is the cow because he creates the cow out of
himself. Then he creates the bull but he is the bull. He is both the
feminine and the masculine.</p><p><br></p><p>Then he follows the cow, and the cow tries to escape the bull. The
cow tries to hide and through her hiding she invites the bull. This is a
hide-and-seek. That is why Hindus say the whole creation is just a play
– a play of the same energy dividing itself into polar opposites and
then playing hide-and-seek.</p><p><br></p><p>You are the Brahman. Your husband is the Brahman; your wife is the
Brahman. And the Brahman is playing hide-and-seek. The whole idea is
simply superb. The reverse is the process to reach the ultimate again:
do not play hide-and-seek. Allow the divided parts to mingle into each
other. Let them merge, and the Brahman arises again – the one.</p><p><br></p><p>This master asks:</p><p><br></p><p>AT WHOSE DESIRE AND BY WHOM IMPELLED DOES THE MIND ALIGHT ON ITS
OBJECTS? BY WHOM IMPELLED DOES THE CHIEF PRANA – VITAL FORCE – PROCEED
TO ITS FUNCTION? – who breathes in you? BY WHOM IMPELLED DO MEN UTTER
THIS SPEECH?</p><p>– who speaks in you? WHAT DEVA OR GOD DIRECTS THE EYES AND EARS? –
who is directing your senses?</p><p><br></p><p>The Upanishads are not against the senses. They are spiritually
sensuous; they do not deny. Denial is not their slogan at all, denial is
not their attitude. They accept and they say that even in the senses the
divine is moving because there is nothing else to move. They make
everything sacred, they make everything holy. They do not condemn, they
do not say this is sin. Sin is unknown to the Upanishads, absolutely
unknown. They say there is no sin – that everything is a play. Even in
sin, even in the sinner, the same energy is moving.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything becomes holy. And if you can say with your full heart that
everything is holy, holy, holy, YOU will become holy immediately because
the very feeling that everything is holy and sacred makes the sin
disappear. Sin is created by condemnation and the more you condemn, the
more sinners you create.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole world has become a great crowd of sinners because
everything has been condemned</p><p>– everything! There is not a single thing which you can do which has
not been condemned by someone or other. With everything condemned, you
become a sinner. Then guilt arises – and when there is guilt you can
pray but the prayer is poisonous; it comes out of your guilt. When you
are guilty you can pray but that prayer is based on fear. That prayer is
not love; it cannot be. Through guilt love is impossible. Feeling
yourself condemned, a sinner, how can you love?</p><p><br></p><p>The Upanishads say that everything is holy because he is the source
of all. Whether or not the river looks dirty to you is irrelevant. He is
the source of all – the dirty river and the sacred Ganges, to both</p><p>he gives the energy. To the sinner to the saint, he gives the energy.
Really, there is no story like this but I would like a story like this:
he created the sinner, then he became the saint, just like the cow and
the bull, and then the hide-and-seek. He created the saint and then he
became the sinner and then the hide-and-seek.…</p><p><br></p><p>Have total acceptance of whatsoever exists. Just by being in
existence, it is holy.</p><p><br></p><p>IT – THE ATMAN, or the Brahman – IS THE EAR OF THE EAR, THE MIND OF
THE MIND, THE SPEECH OF THE SPEECH, THE PRANA OF THE PRANA, AND THE EYE
OF THE EYE. WISE MEN SEPARATING THE ATMAN FROM THESE – SENSE FUNCTIONS –
RISE OUT OF SENSE LIFE AND ATTAIN TO IMMORTALITY.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever you do it is him – it is the functioning of him, of the
total. The total functions in you. When you breathe, what do you do? You
do nothing. The breathing comes in and goes out. Rather, he breathes in
you; you cannot do anything. If the breath leaves you, what will you do?
If it doesn’t come back, what will you do? If it has left then it has
left and if it does not come back you cannot do anything. Really, when
it is not coming you are no more. Who is there to do anything? He
breathes, not you. The emphasis is on the total, not on the
individual.</p><p><br></p><p>This has to be constantly remembered, because we go on forgetting
this. Our emphasis is on the individual, the I: “I am breathing, I am
alive, I am seeing you.” No! The master says he – the Brahman – is
seeing through the eyes, he is the eye of the eye. When I speak, I am
not speaking: he speaks. And when you listen, YOU are not listening: he
listens. He becomes the cow, he becomes the bull; he becomes the
speaker, he becomes the listener. It is a mysterious hide-and-seek, a
great play, a great drama, beautiful, if you can understand. He is
everywhere – in the listener, in the speaker, he is EVERYWHERE! And when
you are silent, he is silent within you. When you speak, he is speaking
in you.</p><p><br></p><p>This emphasis is not only metaphysical, not only a doctrine. As a
doctrine also it is superb. But it is to help you toward a new
realization. While speaking, if you can feel he is speaking, all the
fever in it will be lost. While fighting, if you can remember that he is
fighting through you, the fight will become a drama. While being silent,
feel he is silent within you. And if the silence is disturbed and
thoughts start moving, you know that he is disturbed, not you. He has
become the thoughts and now he is moving like clouds in your inner sky.
He is both, so why be worried? He is both!</p><p><br></p><p>When you are healthy he is healthy in you and when you are ill he is
ill in you. You are totally unworried; you need not come in. Your whole
burden has been thrown upon him. That is why I say this is not only
metaphysical. It is one of the deepest techniques to transform your
total being.</p><p><br></p><p>If he is doing everything, then why do you go on carrying yourself
unnecessarily? He breathes and he is born and he dies. When you die, he
will die – not you. Then why be afraid of death? You become unconcerned.
This unconcern relieves you of all burden. And this is the actual fact;
this is not a make-believe. This is the actual fact: whatsoever is
happening is happening to the total. The individual is just an
illusion.</p><p><br></p><p>I have never been as an ego and I am not as an ego, and I cannot be;
only he is. And when I say he, I mean the total. Do not try to conceive
of him as a person. He is not a person; he is the total –</p><p>the whole. That which breathes in you breathes in the trees and that
which sings in you sings in the birds and that which dances in you
dances in the rivers, in the brooks, in the springs, and that which
speaks in you speaks in the breeze passing through the trees. The
total!</p><p><br></p><p>Just change the gestalt, just change the pattern. Do not emphasize
the individual; move to the total. Then what is the problem? Then there
is no problem. With YOU enters every type of problem; with YOU enters
anguish and anxiety. Without any burden on you, you are liberated. You
can become a MUKTA, a liberated one, you can become a SIDDHA, this very
moment. Just by realizing, feeling that “I am not and he is,” the past
disappears and the future is no more because the future is created out
of your worries, imagination, projections. Then he will take care. Then
whatsoever happens will happen and whatsoever happens will be good
because it is out of him.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what trust is. It is not that you believe in a God sitting
upon some throne in heaven and guiding everyone from there, a great
controller, an engineer or something like that – no! He is not the
managing director. He is not! There is neither any throne nor someone
sitting on it. And faith doesn’t mean that you believe in a concept, in
a philosophy. Faith means trust – trusting the whole. Then everything is
blissful. How can anything else be? How can anything other than bliss
be? You create misery because YOU come in. Go out just as if a lamp has
been put out. Go out... and then he is.</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS THE EAR OF THE EAR, THE MIND OF THE MIND, THE SPEECH OF THE
SPEECH, THE PRANA OF THE PRANA, AND THE EYE OF THE EYE.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever appears on the surface, whatsoever it is, makes no
difference. Always, hidden, he is there. Look at me with full
remembrance, with mindfulness that he is looking through you, and
immediately the quality of consciousness changes. Just now look at me:
he is looking, he is the eye of the eye, and immediately you are not
there and a tremendous silence happens. The very quality of your being
is different when you look at me as if he is looking and not you.</p><p><br></p><p>You are listening to me: forget that I am here; he is here – the
total. The total has taken possession of me, the total has become active
in me, the total has changed me into his instrument. Look at me as if he
is speaking, listen to me as if he is speaking, and then everything is
different. You are no more there... a sudden flash and everything
changes. It is not a question of time. You are not to practice it, you
can see it this very moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at me! You are not there; the total, the whole, has become the
eyes; the whole has become the eyes in you. You are just an expression
of the will of the whole, of the desire of the whole. The whole has
become words through me, he is manipulating me, he is using me. And
then, in this room, only he is. Then the totality becomes one. Then the
parts are lost and the fragments are no more and there is a deep orgasm
between the speaker and listener. Then you will feel the presence but
the presence can come only if you forget yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Remembering God is not really a remembering of his name. Remembering
God is not to go on chanting “Rama, Rama, Krishna, Krishna”; that is
useless, futile. Remembering him means forgetfulness of yourself. If you
are not, if you are forgotten, completely forgetful of yourself,
abandoned, he is. When you are not, suddenly he is – and this can happen
in a single moment.</p><p>I am reminded that after the second world war it happened in a small
village in England that there was a statue of Jesus just on the
crossroads – a beautiful statue with raised hands. And on the statue
there was a plate, and on that plate it was written: Come unto me.</p><p><br></p><p>In the second world war the statue was destroyed; a bomb fell upon
it. And when there was restoration work and the village was again coming
to be alive after the war, they remembered the statue, so they tried to
find fragments of it. In the ruins the fragments were found and the
statue was restored again. But the hands could not be found. They were
missing.</p><p><br></p><p>So the village council decided to ask the artist to make new hands.
But one old man in the village who was always seen sitting near the
statue – both when it was there and when it was not – said, “No! Let
Jesus be without hands.”</p><p><br></p><p>The council said, “Then what will we do about the plate underneath?
It is written, ‘Come unto me!’ and it had raised hands.”</p><p><br></p><p>The old man said, “Change the plate and write there, ‘Come unto me. I
have no other hands than your own.’”</p><p><br></p><p>And now the statue stands there without the hands, and written
underneath is: Come unto me. I have no other hands than yours.</p><p><br></p><p>In your hands he is moving, in your eyes he is moving, and in your
heart he is beating – the total. And he has no other hands, remember. He
has no other eyes, he has no other heart to beat. He is beating all
over, he is alive all over. This is the message.</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS THE EAR OF THE EAR, THE MIND OF THE MIND, THE SPEECH OF THE
SPEECH, THE PRANA OF THE PRANA, AND THE EYE OF THE EYE. WISE MEN
SEPARATING THE ATMAN FROM THESE – SENSE FUNCTIONS – RISE OUT OF SENSE
LIFE AND ATTAIN TO IMMORTALITY.</p><p><br></p><p>All these senses are the functions and he is the functionary within.
Knowing this, you are not against the senses. Knowing this, you simply
change the emphasis. Then you are not obsessed with the senses; you are
always looking for the inner core. And the rishis say that by knowing
this transcendence they attain immortality. Remember, only YOU can die;
life never dies. Because you are born, you will die; that is the natural
end to every birth. Life goes on... eternally moving; life never dies.
Waves in it are born and they die, and the riverlike life moves and
moves and moves.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you come to feel the river within your wave, you are immortal.
If you can realize him seeing through you, breathing through you, you
are immortal. Only this shell, this vehicle of the body, will disappear.
YOU will never disappear. You cannot disappear – you have always
been.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes you were a tree because the tree was the vehicle – because
he willed to be a tree through you. Sometimes you were a cow because he
willed himself to be a cow through you. Sometimes you were a butterfly,
sometimes a flower, sometimes a rock... but you have always been here.
You have ALWAYS been here! You are not a new visitor. No one is a new
visitor; no one is a stranger. You have always been here and now but
with different vehicles. Sometimes a rock was the vehicle; now you are a
man or a woman: now this is a vehicle.</p><p>If you can understand and KNOW that the vehicle is just the vehicle,
the vehicle can be changed. It will have to be changed. But the inner
one who goes on changing faces remains the same. That one is immortal,
life is immortal. You are mortal. And why are you mortal? – because you
become identified with the vehicle. Moving in a cart you become the
cart. Riding on the train you become the train. Flying in an aircraft
you become the aircraft. You go on forgetting that the aircraft, the
cart, the train, the car, they are vehicles.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not the vehicles; you are the total, and the total goes on
changing its vehicles. Then you are immortal. Remember, you cannot be
immortal if you are identified with the body. You are immortal knowing,
transcending the body. The consciousness is immortal, the very aliveness
is immortal.</p><p><br></p><p>The sutra says:</p><p><br></p><p>WISE MEN, TRANSCENDING THESE – SENSE FUNCTIONS – RISE OUT OF SENSE
LIFE AND ATTAIN TO IMMORTALITY.</p><p><br></p><p>And the more you feel the inner, the essential, the eternal, the
immortal, the less and less you are obsessed with the sense life. You
can play it but you are not obsessed.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna playing on his flute is not obsessed with the flute; Krishna
dancing with his girlfriends, the GOPIS, is not obsessed. It is just a
play. Life becomes a play, not an obsession, when you know the
immortal.</p><p><br></p><p>Now get ready for the meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

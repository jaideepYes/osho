The declaration was made by Friedrich Nietzsche. He said, “God is dead, and hence man is totally free from now on.” The declaration looked very strange the moment it was made but it proved prophetic. And, by and by, it became the base of the modern mind.\nReally, for the modern man, God is dead. It is not that God is dead: if God can be dead then nothing can be alive, because by God we mean the essential, eternal life, the very ground of existence. But for modern man God is dead. Or, we can say in another way that modern man is dead toward God. The relationship has broken; the bridge is no longer there. Whether you believe or disbelieve, it makes no difference. Your belief is superficial; it doesn’t go very deep.\nYour disbelief is also superficial. When belief itself is superficial, how can disbelief go very deep? When theists are very superficial, how can atheists be very deep? When the yes itself has lost its\nmeaning, how can the no carry any meaning? All the meaning that atheism can carry comes from the depth of theism. When there are people who can say with their total being YES to God, only then does the no become meaningful. It is secondary.\nGod is dead, and with God even the disbelief is dead. Belief is dead and with it the disbelief is also dead. This century and the modern mind are, in a way, in a very peculiar situation. It has never been so before. There have been persons who were theists who really believed that God exists. There were persons who were really atheists and who believed with the same intensity that God does not exist. But the modern mind is indifferent: it doesn’t care. Whether God exists or not, it is irrelevant. No one is interested in proving it one way or the other.\nReally, this is the meaning of Nietzsche’s declaration that God is dead. You do not care even to deny him. You do not care even to argue against him. The bridge is simply broken. We have no relationship with him – neither for nor against. Why has this happened? Why has this phenomenon become so prominent in the modern mind – this indifference? We will have to seek the causes.\nThe first cause is that we have always been thinking of God as a person. To think about God as a person is false, untrue, and that idea had to die. The idea that God is a person – controlling, managing, creating, maintaining – is false. God is not a person. The idea became so significant because of our minds. Whenever we think about something, either we can think of it as a thing or as a person. Only two alternatives are open: when something exists, then it must either be a thing or a person.\nWe cannot think, we cannot imagine, that things and persons are both manifestations of something deeper – hidden. The same force becomes a thing; the same force becomes a person. But the force itself is neither. God, taken as – a person, is dead. The concept is dead, and the concept had to die because as a person God cannot be proved. And taken as a person, he doesn’t solve any problem. Rather, on the contrary, he creates more – because if God is a person then why is there evil in the world? He must be allowing evil, he must be cooperating with it. Then he becomes an evil person.\nAndre Gide has said somewhere, “It is difficult for me to conceive that God exists as good. But I can conceive that God exists as evil, as Satan, because there is so much evil in the world, so much suffering, so much pain, so much anguish.” He cannot imagine that God is managing this whole affair. There must be something like a devil in charge of it, a supreme devil. God must be good; otherwise what type of God is he? A basic goodness must be there. But as the world appears, it seems that God is devilish and not good – that he is playing with evil, and somehow it appears he is enjoying this whole suffering and torturing.\nIf God is a person, then there are two alternatives open: either he will become a devil or we will have to deny that he exists. And the second is better. God as a person had to die because it became impossible to conceive him as good. But the concept was wrong; it was anthropocentric. We conceived of God as a supreme man, as a superman. God was conceived of as a magnified person like ourselves. We only magnified man.\nIn The Bible it is said that God created man in his own image, but this is said by man. The real thing is just the reverse: man created God in his own image. This man’s image had to disappear. And it is good that this type of God is dead, because with that concept of God removed we can start a fresh inquiry into what God is.\nThe Upanishads are totally different. They never say God is a person; that is why they have a relevance for the modern mind. They do not say that God is a person. They say that God is the very ground of being, not a person. God is existence, not existential. This distinction is subtle, but try to understand it.\nA thing exists, a man exists, a woman exists, a person exists, but they can go out of existence. Whatsoever exists can become nonexistent – it is implied. Whatsoever exists can go out of existence. But existence itself cannot go out of existence. So we can say the chair exists, we can say the house exists, because they can go out of existence. But we cannot say that God exists.\nGod is EXISTENCE – it is not that God exists; God is simply synonymous with existence. Really, to say that God is, is to repeat. God means is. It is bad language to say God is, because the very isness is God. God means is – isness. To say God exists is wrong. God is existence. Or God is just another term for existence. Existence never dies, never goes out of existence. Forms come and go, forms change. Nothing is permanent in the world of forms. So the Upanishads say NAMA and RUPA – name and form – they are the world, and that which is beyond name and form is God. But what is beyond name and form? Existence itself is beyond name and form.\nThe Upanishads think of God not as a person but as existence itself – as the very ground of existence. NAMA-RUPA-ATEET – beyond name, beyond form. What is beyond name and beyond form? There are trees around this house; they exist. There are hills beyond those trees; they exist. You are here; you exist. In the trees, in the hills, in you, what is common? Form is not common: you have a different form, the trees have a different form and the hills have an altogether different form. The names are not common, the forms are not common. What is common? That common denominator will be God. You exist, trees exist, hills exist. Existence is common: everything else is just accidental. The essential is that you exist, the trees exist, the hills exist. Existence is common. That existence is God.\nBut the Upanishads never became very popular. They cannot become popular, because if God is existence then for you all meaning is lost – because then how to relate to existence? If God is a person, a father, a mother, a brother, a beloved, you can relate, you can think of relationship. But how to relate with existence? Existence is so pure, so abstract. How then do you pray to it? How do you call it? How do you cry and weep before it? No one is there.\nBecause of this human weakness, the Upanishads never became very popular. They are so true that they cannot become very popular. To make truth popular is almost impossible because the human mind will not take it as it is. The human mind can only think, “If God is a person, then we can relate.” That is why there is so much influence of BHAKTI cults – of devotional cults. One needs to pray, to be in devotion, to surrender, and a person is there so it becomes easy. You can pray, you can talk, you can communicate. Of course, there is no one there, but for you it becomes easy. If you can imagine that someone is listening to your prayer, it becomes easy for you to pray.\nNo one is listening. There is just abstract existence which has no ears to listen, no eyes to see you, no hands to touch you. But it will be difficult for you to pray. Because of this difficulty, man always thinks that God is a person. Then everything becomes easy but everything becomes wrong. It becomes easy on the one hand but it goes wrong on the other hand.\nSo THAT God is dead, and there is no possibility to revive him, no possibility to give blood or a heartbeat again to him. He is really dead. That God cannot be introduced again in the world. We have passed that moment. The human mind has become more mature; the childish attitude toward God cannot be there again. But it is a hangover. We still go on thinking in terms which are dead. We still go on picturing him although all name and form has dissolved.\nThe Upanishads have a relevance now. Five thousand years ago they were before their time. When this Kenopanishad was written, it was before its time; now the time has come and the Kenopanishad can be understood. The Upan-ishads can be understood because God as a person is no more there. Now God can exist only as an impersonal existence.\nBut there will be difficulties because then you will have to change everything: your whole religion will have to be changed, because the center disappears. For the old religion the center disappears, and with a new center a new type of religion will arise – a new religious attitude.\nHence, my insistence is on meditation not on prayer. Why? – because prayer needs a person, meditation needs no person there. You can meditate without there being a person to listen to you, because meditation is not prayer; it is not addressed to anyone. It is just something you are doing without someone else being there. It is not a relationship.\nIf God is dead, then prayer has become meaningless. Only meditation can become meaningful. When you pray, you pray to someone. When you meditate, you simply meditate. When you pray, prayer is dual – dualistic: you are there and someone else is there to whom the prayer is addressed. Meditation is nondualistic – ADVAITA; there is no one else. It is not a relationship at all. You are alone. And the more you enter this aloneness, the more you enter meditation.\nMeditation means the capacity to be alone – not only to be alone, but to enjoy the very aloneness; to become so alone that the other disappears completely – the other is not there; to become so alone that you start falling within yourself. The abyss opens, and you go on falling within yourself. When you fall within yourself, sooner or later the form will be lost, the name will be lost, because they exist only on the surface. The deeper you drown the more you come nearer to God – God as existence, not as a person.\nSo this is the distinction. If you are praying God is outside you and that God is dead. Now that outside God is no more. You can go on thinking about him, that he is somewhere there in heaven, in the skies, but you yourself will feel this is childish. There is no one there. That God has been escaping from every abode.\nOnce, in the days of the Rigveda, he was living just near in the Himalayas, because the Himalayas were unapproachable. He used to live on Kailash. But then men entered there, so he had to fly from there to where he could not be found. Then he made his abode on the stars, on the moon. But now man has also reached the moon, and now he is not there. Sooner or later, man will be everywhere and God will be nowhere, because where can he hide? Nothing is unapproachable now, or everything will become approachable sooner or later. He has no place to hide. That concept cannot exist anymore. God as a person is not to be found there. And it is good because now you can turn from prayer to meditation.\nReally, prayer is childish. In a way it is neurotic, because you create a God in your imagination and then you start praying to it. And you can become so hallucinatory that you will start answering your prayer from the side of the God. Then you really have gone mad. Then you are not in your senses. You can do it; many people have done it and they are known as great saints. They were ill, because with God only silence is possible. When you become silent you cannot relate to the other; you fall within yourself. God has now come to be a force within. He is not a person without; he is now a force within.\nThere is one beautiful story in the old Indian literature. It is said it happened that God created the world, and then he used to live on earth. It was his own creation, so he enjoyed it and lived with men and animals and trees. But he was in a great difficulty, because the whole day he was disturbed and even in the night he was not allowed to sleep, because people would go on complaining: “This is wrong, that is wrong; why have you done this, why not do it this way?” Everyone would come to advise him and give suggestions.\nHe got so fed up that he called a council of his wise deities, wise counselors, and he asked them, “Find a place for me to hide from my own creation, because they will kill me or I will commit suicide. Every single moment they come to advise me, and they keep saying, ‘Do this and do that; this is wrong, and this must not be done,’ and their opinions are so contradictory that if I follow them the whole thing will become a mess.”\nSo someone suggested, “You go to the Himalayas. Hide there on Gourishankar, Everest.”\n“But,” God said, “you cannot see further ahead. Some day Tensing and Hillary will come there, and it is only a question of a few hours.” For God it is only a question of a few hours, so he said, “This will not do.”\nThen someone suggested, “Go to the moon.”\n“But,” he said, “you don’t know. Only a few minutes more and men will be there.”\nThen one old, wise counselor came to him and said in his ear, “It will be better that you hide in man himself. There he will never try to enter.”\nAnd it is said that God accepted the suggestion, and from that moment he has not been troubled at all.\nNow the moment has come to trouble him there. And only through meditation can you enter there, not through prayer, because prayer goes on believing that he lives somewhere – on the moon, on Everest; prayer goes on trying to locate him outside. Meditation completely washes away the whole concept that he is outside, or that he can be prayed to, or that he can be talked to, or that you can relate to him. No, you can simply move within yourself. And the deeper you move, the deeper you are moving in him. But this meeting will be in silence because he is not the other. He is YOU – he has been hiding as you.\nIf you can follow me, if you can understand the distinction between prayer and meditation – God as a person and God as existence – then it will be easy to follow this sutra:\nWHAT SIGHT FAILS TO SEE, BUT WHAT SEES SIGHT – KNOW THOU THAT ALONE AS BRAHMAN, AND NOT THIS THAT PEOPLE WORSHIP HERE.\nWHAT SIGHT FAILS TO SEE... because if he is without, you can see him. Then the sight cannot fail to see. Then ways and means can be found, and you can see him if he is without. But he is not there. That is why the sutra says: WHAT SIGHT FAILS TO SEE. You cannot see him; there is no way to see. Whatsoever you do you cannot see him. But people have seen him, so what to say about them? What to think of them? They have seen!\nThere have been Christian mystics who say they have seen Jesus standing before them. There have been Hindu devotees who say they have seen Krishna playing on his flute. There are other types of devotees all over the world. Someone sees him as Rama, someone sees him as Krishna, someone sees him as Jesus, someone as Mary... and they go on seeing.\nThis Upanishad says, WHAT SIGHT FAILS TO SEE – then they must have been imagining. Beautiful imaginings, very deeply satisfying! When you see Jesus standing before you, you are filled with a deep contentment, with deep satisfaction. But it is still a dream – beautiful, but a dream. A vision that you have created, a vision that you have desired, a vision that you have longed to see. And whatsoever you long to see you are capable of seeing, because the human mind can create any imagination and give it reality. That is the capacity of the human mind. You can create a dream and you can make it real.\nOf course, it will be real only for you, no one else. So when you see Jesus you cannot make him a vision for others also. If your friends ask you, “Allow us also to see your vision,” you cannot help. You cannot do anything because a dream has a peculiar quality: it cannot be shared. You can dream your dream, I can dream my dream – but you cannot enter into my dream, I cannot enter into your dream. A dream is the most private thing in the world. Everything can be made public, but dreams cannot be made public.\nHowsoever you love your friend, your wife, your husband, howsoever intimate you are, you cannot enter into each other’s dreams. That remains private. And the same is the case with visions such as your seeing Jesus. No one else can share this experience. You will walk with him on the street, and everyone will see you walking alone; that is a private dream of your own.\nI have heard one anecdote.…\nIt happened once that a girl, a young girl, dreamt that a very beautiful prince came riding on a horse. He picked her up, kissed her deeply, and then rode away with her. The horse was running fast and the girl asked the prince, “Where are you leading me? Where are you taking me away to?”\nThe prince said, “It is YOUR dream – you tell me. It is your dream, and you will have to tell me where I am to lead you to. You tell me!”\nWhen you are seeing a vision of Jesus or Krishna, really you have only divided your own mind into two parts: one which has become the devotee and the other which has become the God. And if you ask Krishna, “Where are you leading me?” he will say to you, “It is your dream. You tell me.”\nBut when I say it is a dream I am not condemning it, I am simply stating a fact. It is beautiful. You can enjoy it! There is nothing wrong – what is wrong with enjoying a dream, a beautiful dream? You can enjoy it. The problem arises if you start thinking it is reality. Then you are moving on dangerous terrain; then be aware. The mind can project anything.\nGo to any madhouse and see. There you will see everyone talking to someone who is not present; everyone is talking and answering also. Every man there has become split. They go on seeing visions, they go on seeing projections. And those projections appear so real to them that we have to put them in madhouses because now they cannot be relied upon. They have lost contact with reality and are now in contact only with the dream world.\nThat is what a madman means: he has lost contact with reality. With fact there is now no contact; only with his own fiction is there contact. He lives in his own private world. He is not living with you in the real world, he is not a part of it. You cannot convince a madman that he is wrong. That is impossible! He may confuse you, but you cannot confuse him. And if you live a long time with a madman you may go mad yourself.\nI have heard it happened once that an emperor became mad. He had a passion for playing chess, so some psychologist suggested that if a great chess player went on playing chess with him, this might relax his mind. He was still interested in chess. The whole world had become nonexistent; only chess had remained as a link to the real world. So the greatest champion was called, and that champion played chess with that mad emperor.\nFor one year this continued – he was playing chess with the mad emperor. And in the end it happened that the emperor became okay, but the chess player became mad. He traveled back to reality and the poor man who was playing chess with him became mad.\nIf you live with a madman for one year, it will be difficult for you not to become mad. He will confuse you, but you cannot confuse him. He is beyond that. You cannot touch him, because he lives in his own private world. You cannot enter that world. It is impossible to enter into his private world. And you cannot convince him that he is wrong. Wrong and right, true and false, are the distinctions of the real world. In the dream world nothing is wrong, nothing is right. Whatsoever is, is right by its own right; just by being there it is right.\nThere are religious madnesses, there are secular madnesses. People can go mad in two ways – a secular way and a religious way. When you go mad in a religious way, people will respect you because they think you have achieved something. So remember, do not go mad the secular way; whenever you want to go mad, don’t go the secular way, always try the religious way. Then people will respect you – but only in the East. It is now no longer so in the West: whatsoever the type, they will call you mad.\nWhenever you are projecting a reality through your own mind, you are creating an illusion around yourself and then you can see. The Upanishads are so realistic. They say you cannot see: WHAT SIGHT FAILS TO SEE, BUT WHAT SEES SIGHT. You cannot see him through the eyes, but he can see your eyes because he is hidden behind you. Your eyes are just in front of him. He is you; he can see your eyes. But you cannot see him through the eyes. He is hidden behind all your senses so he can see your senses.\nIf you go deep into meditation you can see the inner core of your body, the inner wall. This has been a strange happening, because in the West it is only three hundred years since medical science came to know about the inner structure of the body – and that too by dissection. By cutting the body, analyzing the body, dissecting the body, Western medical science came to know about the inner structure of it.\nBut for the East it has been a strange phenomenon. Yogis and tantrikas have always known it, and they never dissected a single body. They know how many NADIS, how many nerves there are. They have completely determined how the whole inner body functions – but they never dissected a body, they were not surgeons. How did they come to know about it? They came to know it through a totally different way. They became so meditatively silent within that in that silence they became detached from the body. They became just an awareness inside. Then they started to see what is inside.\nYou know your body only from the outside. This is peculiar because you live inside and yet you have not observed it from the inside. It is as if you live in a house, and you go around and around it never coming to know it from within – how it looks from within. Your body has two surfaces. There is the outer surface which we are aware of because we can see it through the eyes, touch it with the hands. Then there is the inner surface of the body for which the eyes and the hands cannot be used.\nIf you can simply become alert and silent, detached, you will come to know the inner surface. Then you can see your eyes, and then you can hear your ears, and then you can touch your hands, and then you can know your body. But your body cannot know you.\nThis is what the sutra says:\nWHAT SIGHT FAILS TO SEE, BUT WHAT SEES SIGHT – KNOW THOU THAT ALONE AS BRAHMAN, AND NOT THIS THAT PEOPLE WORSHIP HERE.\nExcept for your body, there is no temple to enter and search in. There is no mosque and no church where God abides – he abides in you. If you can enter and fall back upon your center of consciousness, know that alone to be the Brahman – to be the ultimate, to be the real, to be the existence, and do not fall a victim to all that which is worshipped by people here.\nPeople go on worshipping their own imaginations, people go on worshipping their own creations. Then fashions change and when fashions change, imagination changes. Then you have to create new idols, new images, new places of worship. Hence, so many religions on the earth; otherwise, it is absurd. How can there be so many religions? If truth is one how can there be so many religions? Science is one but why is religion not one? Why is science not Christian science, Hindu science, Mohammedan science? It is not possible because science deals with fact. And if you deal with fact, then there can be only one science because fact is not a private thing. If you come upon a fact, then everyone has to accept it; there is no other way. You cannot go on denying it. And if you deny science, it will be at your own loss. If physics comes to know a law, then you cannot say, “I am an Indian and I cannot believe a man who is discovering a law in England. How can I follow an Englishman or a Chinese? We are of different nations; our cultures are different.” You cannot say that. A physical law is a physical law. It makes no difference who discovers it. Once discovered it is universal.\nScience is one, but why is religion not one? If it is also the ultimate law it must be one – more one than science because science deals only with outer facts and religion deals with the inner truth. Why should it be so? There are three hundred religions – how is it possible?\nThese three hundred religions exist because of fiction, dream, not because of truth. They can exist because they are your creations, not your realizations. You create your own mode of worship, you create your own temple. Your religions are artistic creations, not scientific realizations – artistic creations! You paint your own religion and you like your paintings and you cannot think that any other’s painting is better than your own. You like it, so you go on fighting that your painting is supreme; no one else can paint such a thing. All else is secondary. You can tolerate others’ paintings if you are a good man. You can tolerate others with a patronizing attitude thinking, “They are a little stupid, foolish. Just wait. They will come to the right thing.”\nChristians go on waiting that Hindus will come to their senses and they will become Christians. Hindus go on waiting for these foolish Christians thinking that some day or other they will be converted, they will become Hindus. How can they escape the truth? And Jainas go on thinking that all the followers of Krishna and Christ are following untrue masters. How can they follow a false master for so long? Some day or other they will come to the right master, Mahavira. They will follow him. Everyone goes on thinking inside that he is right and everyone else is wrong.\nThis happens because for the masses religion is imagination. They have their own imaginations; they have painted their own world. It is artistic. Nothing – is wrong with it. You decorate your house in your own way; it is good. Who is there to say that it is wrong? It is no one’s right. You decorate your house in your own way but you do not fight about decoration. You do not say, “My decoration is the ultimate truth.” Everyone else is allowed to decorate his house in his own way.\nYou are doing the same thing with your mind. You decorate it with your own images, worship, prayer, your own Bibles, your own Gitas. You go on decorating your inner world and then you become part of it, you live in it. This is illusory.\nThe sutra says: That alone is Brahman which you realize when you transcend the senses, when you go behind the senses, when you can see the eyes, when you can hear the ears, when you can touch the hand from within.\nTHAT ALONE KNOW AS BRAHMAN, AND NOT THIS THAT PEOPLE WORSHIP HERE. WHAT HEARING FAILS TO HEAR, BUT WHAT HEARS HEARING – KNOW THOU THAT ALONE AS BRAHMAN, AND NOT THIS THAT PEOPLE WORSHIP HERE. WHAT PRANA DOES NOT REVEAL, BUT WHAT REVEALS PRANA – KNOW THOU THAT ALONE AS BRAHMAN, AND NOT THIS THAT PEOPLE WORSHIP HERE.\nAll the temples are false, all the mosques are false, all the churches are false. I am not condemning them; I am simply stating a fact – because they are creations of the imagination. I do not say destroy them, I say enjoy them – but do not think that this enjoyment is leading you toward the ultimate. Enjoy the creations. It is a good game; nothing is wrong with it. People are going to the movies, people are going to dancehalls. Why should they not be allowed to enjoy a religious fantasy? In their temples, in their mosques, in their GURUDWARAS, they should be allowed – they are free! And it is better to have a religious fantasy than not to have – anything. But do not think that you are realizing the\nBrahman there; you cannot. He is not there, so you cannot do anything. You can enjoy yourself. – You can enjoy your fantasy, your dream world.\nIf this is understood, then temples can exist. They are beautiful, artistic creations but do not be lost in them. Go there, but do not be lost there. Go on remembering that whatsoever is worshipped by the people is not the real Brahman, because the real Brahman is hidden in the worshipper. This is the emphasis. When I worship, I am there and the object of worship is there. Where is Brahman? – in the object of worship or in the worshipper? The emphasis of the Upanishads is: it is in the worshipper, not in the object of worship. The object of worship is secondary; it is created by the worshipper. The value of what you feel there is projected by you; it is given by you. It is a gift to the object from you.\nYou can put a round rock in your house and you can worship it as Shiva – it is SHIVALINGA. And the rock was lying in the street or just on a riverbed for millions of years. No one worshipped it; no one knew that this is Shiva. The river never cared; the animals passed by it, they never looked at it. And suddenly you transform the rock. Suddenly the rock becomes an object of worship, sacred, and now no one can touch it. And people were walking over it. Their feet touched it for centuries. Now suddenly you create a pedestal. You put the rock there. You say that this is Shivalinga, that this is the symbol of the god Shiva, and then you worship and you feel very good.\nNothing is bad about it. The rock is beautiful and if you enjoy, then enjoy. But remember, the rock is simply a rock and Shiva is your creation. You have projected him; you have made that rock into a Shiva. The god is created by you; the rock is not even aware. And if the rock could see you it would laugh: “This man has gone mad. What are you doing worshipping me?” The worshipper – creates the worshipped, the devotee creates the god.\nThe Upanishads say that there you will not find the real, you will only find the imagined. Move, rather, into the worshipper; penetrate into the worshipper. Forget the objects of worship and just try to know who is this worshipper – who is this who is worshipping? Who is this who is praying? Who is this who is going to the temple? And if you can find out who this is who worships, you have found the Brahman.\nI have heard that once it happened that a Zen master, Huang Po, was delivering a sermon. Suddenly a man stood up. The man said, “I have been listening and listening for years, and everyone says ‘Know thyself,’ but I don’t follow the meaning. What do you mean by knowing thyself? Please try to explain it to me in simple terms. I am not a very learned man; I do not know the jargon. Simply state the thing. What do you mean by ‘Know thyself’?”\nHuang Po said, “If you cannot follow the jargon, then I will not use language.” He said to the people who were listening, “Make way, so that I can reach that man.” Huang Po came down from his rostrum and walked to the man. The man became a little afraid, uneasy, because he never thought there was any need to come so near. Is this man going to attack? And Huang Po looked very aggressive – he was a man like a lion. So the man became afraid, and others also became uneasy about what was going to happen. And they knew about Huang Po. Sometimes he had slapped, sometimes he had thrown an inquirer out of the door, and sometimes he had beaten.So what is going to\nhappen? There was silence, dead silence; no one was breathing.\nThen Huang Po came near. He took the collar of that man in his hand, and he said, “Close your eyes.” So the man, just out of fear, closed his eyes. There was total silence. The man closed his eyes, and then Huang Po said, “Now KNOW who is there.” So the man stood there, the whole hall silent, no one was breathing, and Huang Po just stood there.…\nThe man closed his eyes. He must really have been a simple, innocent man. He closed his eyes and he tried to find out who he is. He searched and searched and searched, and time went on.\nThen Huang Po asked him, “Now open your eyes and tell me who you are.”\nThe man opened his eyes. His eyes were totally different; the quality had changed. The man began smiling, then he bowed down to touch the feet of Huang Po and he said, “I never thought you would throw me upon myself, but I was thrown. Now do not ask me because I cannot say. I am not a learned man. But now I will never ask who I am. I have known it.”\nThe Upanishads are trying to throw you to yourself. Forget the object of worship... just move within. And how can you move within? It is easy to forget the object of worship, but it is difficult to move within because there are objects still in the mind which go on clinging around you. Whenever you close your eyes, there is a world of imagination around you: dreams go on floating, images come up, thoughts move in a procession. Again you are in a world. The world of things is no more there, but the world of thoughts is there. Unless this world of thoughts also ceases, you cannot know the worshipper.\nAnd how will it cease if you go on cooperating with it, go on creating it? You cannot destroy the world of things because you never created it. Remember, – you cannot destroy the world of things. How can you destroy the hills, the earth, the moon, the stars? You cannot destroy them because you never created them! But you can destroy the world of thoughts because you are the sole creator there. No one else has helped you. You alone have done the whole work.\nThoughts exist because you cooperate with them. Do not cooperate – this is the only technique. Be indifferent. Just look at them without loving them, without hating them, without condemning them, without appreciating them, without saying they are good, without saying they are bad. Do not say anything; do not take any attitude. Just be indifferent, an onlooker.\nThe clouds are floating in the sky. You sit under a tree and you just see – the clouds floating; you do not take any attitude. You do not say, “Why are these clouds floating? They should not,” or “They should.” You do not take any attitude. You just simply become an observer, and you look at the clouds passing in the sky.\nIn the same way look at the thoughts passing in the inner sky. Do not take any attitude. The moment you take an attitude you have started cooperating. The clouds in the outside sky will not disappear if you do not take any attitude, but the clouds in the inner sky WILL disappear. They only exist because of you. If you are indifferent, they simply go. They are invitees. You may know it or you may not know it – they are guests you have invited before.\nIt has been very long ago, and you have forgotten that you have invited them. It may have been in some other life that you invited them. But nothing happens to your inner world uninvited. Each\nthought has been invited, and now it comes and still you give energy to it. You can give energy in two ways. If you are against it you will also give energy. In both ways the thought will feed upon it.\nThere is only one way to be disconnected, and that is to be indifferent. Buddha has called it UPEKSHA. He said if you are indifferent to the process of thoughts, they will disappear.\nInsist on being indifferent. Do not take any attitude, do not choose. Just remain a witness, and they will disappear. And when they disappear, suddenly the worshipper is revealed: suddenly you are revealed to yourself. That revelation alone is Brahman, and NOT THIS THAT PEOPLE WORSHIP HERE.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6862","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_supreme_doctrine/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_supreme_doctrine/>The Supreme Doctrine</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">6 God Is Existence</h1><div class=post-meta>33 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6862 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Supreme_Doctrine/part6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

AS BRAHMAN, AND NOT THIS THAT PEOPLE WORSHIP HERE.</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT HEARING FAILS TO HEAR, BUT WHAT HEARS HEARING – KNOW THOU THAT
ALONE AS BRAHMAN, AND NOT THIS THAT PEOPLE WORSHIP HERE.</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT PRANA DOES NOT REVEAL, BUT WHAT REVEALS PRANA – KNOW THOU THAT
ALONE AS BRAHMAN, AND NOT THIS THAT PEOPLE WORSHIP HERE.</p><p><br></p><p>This century started with a very strange declaration. The declaration
was made by Friedrich Nietzsche. He said, “God is dead, and hence man is
totally free from now on.” The declaration looked very strange the
moment it was made but it proved prophetic. And, by and by, it became
the base of the modern mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Really, for the modern man, God is dead. It is not that God is dead:
if God can be dead then nothing can be alive, because by God we mean the
essential, eternal life, the very ground of existence. But for modern
man God is dead. Or, we can say in another way that modern man is dead
toward God. The relationship has broken; the bridge is no longer there.
Whether you believe or disbelieve, it makes no difference. Your belief
is superficial; it doesn’t go very deep.</p><p><br></p><p>Your disbelief is also superficial. When belief itself is
superficial, how can disbelief go very deep? When theists are very
superficial, how can atheists be very deep? When the yes itself has lost
its</p><p>meaning, how can the no carry any meaning? All the meaning that
atheism can carry comes from the depth of theism. When there are people
who can say with their total being YES to God, only then does the no
become meaningful. It is secondary.</p><p><br></p><p>God is dead, and with God even the disbelief is dead. Belief is dead
and with it the disbelief is also dead. This century and the modern mind
are, in a way, in a very peculiar situation. It has never been so
before. There have been persons who were theists who really believed
that God exists. There were persons who were really atheists and who
believed with the same intensity that God does not exist. But the modern
mind is indifferent: it doesn’t care. Whether God exists or not, it is
irrelevant. No one is interested in proving it one way or the other.</p><p><br></p><p>Really, this is the meaning of Nietzsche’s declaration that God is
dead. You do not care even to deny him. You do not care even to argue
against him. The bridge is simply broken. We have no relationship with
him – neither for nor against. Why has this happened? Why has this
phenomenon become so prominent in the modern mind – this indifference?
We will have to seek the causes.</p><p><br></p><p>The first cause is that we have always been thinking of God as a
person. To think about God as a person is false, untrue, and that idea
had to die. The idea that God is a person – controlling, managing,
creating, maintaining – is false. God is not a person. The idea became
so significant because of our minds. Whenever we think about something,
either we can think of it as a thing or as a person. Only two
alternatives are open: when something exists, then it must either be a
thing or a person.</p><p><br></p><p>We cannot think, we cannot imagine, that things and persons are both
manifestations of something deeper – hidden. The same force becomes a
thing; the same force becomes a person. But the force itself is neither.
God, taken as – a person, is dead. The concept is dead, and the concept
had to die because as a person God cannot be proved. And taken as a
person, he doesn’t solve any problem. Rather, on the contrary, he
creates more – because if God is a person then why is there evil in the
world? He must be allowing evil, he must be cooperating with it. Then he
becomes an evil person.</p><p><br></p><p>Andre Gide has said somewhere, “It is difficult for me to conceive
that God exists as good. But I can conceive that God exists as evil, as
Satan, because there is so much evil in the world, so much suffering, so
much pain, so much anguish.” He cannot imagine that God is managing this
whole affair. There must be something like a devil in charge of it, a
supreme devil. God must be good; otherwise what type of God is he? A
basic goodness must be there. But as the world appears, it seems that
God is devilish and not good – that he is playing with evil, and somehow
it appears he is enjoying this whole suffering and torturing.</p><p><br></p><p>If God is a person, then there are two alternatives open: either he
will become a devil or we will have to deny that he exists. And the
second is better. God as a person had to die because it became
impossible to conceive him as good. But the concept was wrong; it was
anthropocentric. We conceived of God as a supreme man, as a superman.
God was conceived of as a magnified person like ourselves. We only
magnified man.</p><p><br></p><p>In The Bible it is said that God created man in his own image, but
this is said by man. The real thing is just the reverse: man created God
in his own image. This man’s image had to disappear. And it is good that
this type of God is dead, because with that concept of God removed we
can start a fresh inquiry into what God is.</p><p>The Upanishads are totally different. They never say God is a person;
that is why they have a relevance for the modern mind. They do not say
that God is a person. They say that God is the very ground of being, not
a person. God is existence, not existential. This distinction is subtle,
but try to understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>A thing exists, a man exists, a woman exists, a person exists, but
they can go out of existence. Whatsoever exists can become nonexistent –
it is implied. Whatsoever exists can go out of existence. But existence
itself cannot go out of existence. So we can say the chair exists, we
can say the house exists, because they can go out of existence. But we
cannot say that God exists.</p><p><br></p><p>God is EXISTENCE – it is not that God exists; God is simply
synonymous with existence. Really, to say that God is, is to repeat. God
means is. It is bad language to say God is, because the very isness is
God. God means is – isness. To say God exists is wrong. God is
existence. Or God is just another term for existence. Existence never
dies, never goes out of existence. Forms come and go, forms change.
Nothing is permanent in the world of forms. So the Upanishads say NAMA
and RUPA – name and form – they are the world, and that which is beyond
name and form is God. But what is beyond name and form? Existence itself
is beyond name and form.</p><p><br></p><p>The Upanishads think of God not as a person but as existence itself –
as the very ground of existence. NAMA-RUPA-ATEET – beyond name, beyond
form. What is beyond name and beyond form? There are trees around this
house; they exist. There are hills beyond those trees; they exist. You
are here; you exist. In the trees, in the hills, in you, what is common?
Form is not common: you have a different form, the trees have a
different form and the hills have an altogether different form. The
names are not common, the forms are not common. What is common? That
common denominator will be God. You exist, trees exist, hills exist.
Existence is common: everything else is just accidental. The essential
is that you exist, the trees exist, the hills exist. Existence is
common. That existence is God.</p><p><br></p><p>But the Upanishads never became very popular. They cannot become
popular, because if God is existence then for you all meaning is lost –
because then how to relate to existence? If God is a person, a father, a
mother, a brother, a beloved, you can relate, you can think of
relationship. But how to relate with existence? Existence is so pure, so
abstract. How then do you pray to it? How do you call it? How do you cry
and weep before it? No one is there.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of this human weakness, the Upanishads never became very
popular. They are so true that they cannot become very popular. To make
truth popular is almost impossible because the human mind will not take
it as it is. The human mind can only think, “If God is a person, then we
can relate.” That is why there is so much influence of BHAKTI cults – of
devotional cults. One needs to pray, to be in devotion, to surrender,
and a person is there so it becomes easy. You can pray, you can talk,
you can communicate. Of course, there is no one there, but for you it
becomes easy. If you can imagine that someone is listening to your
prayer, it becomes easy for you to pray.</p><p><br></p><p>No one is listening. There is just abstract existence which has no
ears to listen, no eyes to see you, no hands to touch you. But it will
be difficult for you to pray. Because of this difficulty, man always
thinks that God is a person. Then everything becomes easy but everything
becomes wrong. It becomes easy on the one hand but it goes wrong on the
other hand.</p><p>So THAT God is dead, and there is no possibility to revive him, no
possibility to give blood or a heartbeat again to him. He is really
dead. That God cannot be introduced again in the world. We have passed
that moment. The human mind has become more mature; the childish
attitude toward God cannot be there again. But it is a hangover. We
still go on thinking in terms which are dead. We still go on picturing
him although all name and form has dissolved.</p><p><br></p><p>The Upanishads have a relevance now. Five thousand years ago they
were before their time. When this Kenopanishad was written, it was
before its time; now the time has come and the Kenopanishad can be
understood. The Upan-ishads can be understood because God as a person is
no more there. Now God can exist only as an impersonal existence.</p><p><br></p><p>But there will be difficulties because then you will have to change
everything: your whole religion will have to be changed, because the
center disappears. For the old religion the center disappears, and with
a new center a new type of religion will arise – a new religious
attitude.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, my insistence is on meditation not on prayer. Why? – because
prayer needs a person, meditation needs no person there. You can
meditate without there being a person to listen to you, because
meditation is not prayer; it is not addressed to anyone. It is just
something you are doing without someone else being there. It is not a
relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>If God is dead, then prayer has become meaningless. Only meditation
can become meaningful. When you pray, you pray to someone. When you
meditate, you simply meditate. When you pray, prayer is dual –
dualistic: you are there and someone else is there to whom the prayer is
addressed. Meditation is nondualistic – ADVAITA; there is no one else.
It is not a relationship at all. You are alone. And the more you enter
this aloneness, the more you enter meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation means the capacity to be alone – not only to be alone, but
to enjoy the very aloneness; to become so alone that the other
disappears completely – the other is not there; to become so alone that
you start falling within yourself. The abyss opens, and you go on
falling within yourself. When you fall within yourself, sooner or later
the form will be lost, the name will be lost, because they exist only on
the surface. The deeper you drown the more you come nearer to God – God
as existence, not as a person.</p><p><br></p><p>So this is the distinction. If you are praying God is outside you and
that God is dead. Now that outside God is no more. You can go on
thinking about him, that he is somewhere there in heaven, in the skies,
but you yourself will feel this is childish. There is no one there. That
God has been escaping from every abode.</p><p><br></p><p>Once, in the days of the Rigveda, he was living just near in the
Himalayas, because the Himalayas were unapproachable. He used to live on
Kailash. But then men entered there, so he had to fly from there to
where he could not be found. Then he made his abode on the stars, on the
moon. But now man has also reached the moon, and now he is not there.
Sooner or later, man will be everywhere and God will be nowhere, because
where can he hide? Nothing is unapproachable now, or everything will
become approachable sooner or later. He has no place to hide. That
concept cannot exist anymore. God as a person is not to be found there.
And it is good because now you can turn from prayer to meditation.</p><p>Really, prayer is childish. In a way it is neurotic, because you
create a God in your imagination and then you start praying to it. And
you can become so hallucinatory that you will start answering your
prayer from the side of the God. Then you really have gone mad. Then you
are not in your senses. You can do it; many people have done it and they
are known as great saints. They were ill, because with God only silence
is possible. When you become silent you cannot relate to the other; you
fall within yourself. God has now come to be a force within. He is not a
person without; he is now a force within.</p><p><br></p><p>There is one beautiful story in the old Indian literature. It is said
it happened that God created the world, and then he used to live on
earth. It was his own creation, so he enjoyed it and lived with men and
animals and trees. But he was in a great difficulty, because the whole
day he was disturbed and even in the night he was not allowed to sleep,
because people would go on complaining: “This is wrong, that is wrong;
why have you done this, why not do it this way?” Everyone would come to
advise him and give suggestions.</p><p><br></p><p>He got so fed up that he called a council of his wise deities, wise
counselors, and he asked them, “Find a place for me to hide from my own
creation, because they will kill me or I will commit suicide. Every
single moment they come to advise me, and they keep saying, ‘Do this and
do that; this is wrong, and this must not be done,’ and their opinions
are so contradictory that if I follow them the whole thing will become a
mess.”</p><p><br></p><p>So someone suggested, “You go to the Himalayas. Hide there on
Gourishankar, Everest.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But,” God said, “you cannot see further ahead. Some day Tensing and
Hillary will come there, and it is only a question of a few hours.” For
God it is only a question of a few hours, so he said, “This will not
do.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then someone suggested, “Go to the moon.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But,” he said, “you don’t know. Only a few minutes more and men will
be there.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then one old, wise counselor came to him and said in his ear, “It
will be better that you hide in man himself. There he will never try to
enter.”</p><p><br></p><p>And it is said that God accepted the suggestion, and from that moment
he has not been troubled at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the moment has come to trouble him there. And only through
meditation can you enter there, not through prayer, because prayer goes
on believing that he lives somewhere – on the moon, on Everest; prayer
goes on trying to locate him outside. Meditation completely washes away
the whole concept that he is outside, or that he can be prayed to, or
that he can be talked to, or that you can relate to him. No, you can
simply move within yourself. And the deeper you move, the deeper you are
moving in him. But this meeting will be in silence because he is not the
other. He is YOU – he has been hiding as you.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can follow me, if you can understand the distinction between
prayer and meditation – God as a person and God as existence – then it
will be easy to follow this sutra:</p><p>WHAT SIGHT FAILS TO SEE, BUT WHAT SEES SIGHT – KNOW THOU THAT ALONE
AS BRAHMAN, AND NOT THIS THAT PEOPLE WORSHIP HERE.</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT SIGHT FAILS TO SEE... because if he is without, you can see him.
Then the sight cannot fail to see. Then ways and means can be found, and
you can see him if he is without. But he is not there. That is why the
sutra says: WHAT SIGHT FAILS TO SEE. You cannot see him; there is no way
to see. Whatsoever you do you cannot see him. But people have seen him,
so what to say about them? What to think of them? They have seen!</p><p><br></p><p>There have been Christian mystics who say they have seen Jesus
standing before them. There have been Hindu devotees who say they have
seen Krishna playing on his flute. There are other types of devotees all
over the world. Someone sees him as Rama, someone sees him as Krishna,
someone sees him as Jesus, someone as Mary... and they go on seeing.</p><p><br></p><p>This Upanishad says, WHAT SIGHT FAILS TO SEE – then they must have
been imagining. Beautiful imaginings, very deeply satisfying! When you
see Jesus standing before you, you are filled with a deep contentment,
with deep satisfaction. But it is still a dream – beautiful, but a
dream. A vision that you have created, a vision that you have desired, a
vision that you have longed to see. And whatsoever you long to see you
are capable of seeing, because the human mind can create any imagination
and give it reality. That is the capacity of the human mind. You can
create a dream and you can make it real.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, it will be real only for you, no one else. So when you see
Jesus you cannot make him a vision for others also. If your friends ask
you, “Allow us also to see your vision,” you cannot help. You cannot do
anything because a dream has a peculiar quality: it cannot be shared.
You can dream your dream, I can dream my dream – but you cannot enter
into my dream, I cannot enter into your dream. A dream is the most
private thing in the world. Everything can be made public, but dreams
cannot be made public.</p><p><br></p><p>Howsoever you love your friend, your wife, your husband, howsoever
intimate you are, you cannot enter into each other’s dreams. That
remains private. And the same is the case with visions such as your
seeing Jesus. No one else can share this experience. You will walk with
him on the street, and everyone will see you walking alone; that is a
private dream of your own.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard one anecdote.…</p><p><br></p><p>It happened once that a girl, a young girl, dreamt that a very
beautiful prince came riding on a horse. He picked her up, kissed her
deeply, and then rode away with her. The horse was running fast and the
girl asked the prince, “Where are you leading me? Where are you taking
me away to?”</p><p><br></p><p>The prince said, “It is YOUR dream – you tell me. It is your dream,
and you will have to tell me where I am to lead you to. You tell
me!”</p><p><br></p><p>When you are seeing a vision of Jesus or Krishna, really you have
only divided your own mind into two parts: one which has become the
devotee and the other which has become the God. And if you ask Krishna,
“Where are you leading me?” he will say to you, “It is your dream. You
tell me.”</p><p>But when I say it is a dream I am not condemning it, I am simply
stating a fact. It is beautiful. You can enjoy it! There is nothing
wrong – what is wrong with enjoying a dream, a beautiful dream? You can
enjoy it. The problem arises if you start thinking it is reality. Then
you are moving on dangerous terrain; then be aware. The mind can project
anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Go to any madhouse and see. There you will see everyone talking to
someone who is not present; everyone is talking and answering also.
Every man there has become split. They go on seeing visions, they go on
seeing projections. And those projections appear so real to them that we
have to put them in madhouses because now they cannot be relied upon.
They have lost contact with reality and are now in contact only with the
dream world.</p><p><br></p><p>That is what a madman means: he has lost contact with reality. With
fact there is now no contact; only with his own fiction is there
contact. He lives in his own private world. He is not living with you in
the real world, he is not a part of it. You cannot convince a madman
that he is wrong. That is impossible! He may confuse you, but you cannot
confuse him. And if you live a long time with a madman you may go mad
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard it happened once that an emperor became mad. He had a
passion for playing chess, so some psychologist suggested that if a
great chess player went on playing chess with him, this might relax his
mind. He was still interested in chess. The whole world had become
nonexistent; only chess had remained as a link to the real world. So the
greatest champion was called, and that champion played chess with that
mad emperor.</p><p><br></p><p>For one year this continued – he was playing chess with the mad
emperor. And in the end it happened that the emperor became okay, but
the chess player became mad. He traveled back to reality and the poor
man who was playing chess with him became mad.</p><p><br></p><p>If you live with a madman for one year, it will be difficult for you
not to become mad. He will confuse you, but you cannot confuse him. He
is beyond that. You cannot touch him, because he lives in his own
private world. You cannot enter that world. It is impossible to enter
into his private world. And you cannot convince him that he is wrong.
Wrong and right, true and false, are the distinctions of the real world.
In the dream world nothing is wrong, nothing is right. Whatsoever is, is
right by its own right; just by being there it is right.</p><p><br></p><p>There are religious madnesses, there are secular madnesses. People
can go mad in two ways – a secular way and a religious way. When you go
mad in a religious way, people will respect you because they think you
have achieved something. So remember, do not go mad the secular way;
whenever you want to go mad, don’t go the secular way, always try the
religious way. Then people will respect you – but only in the East. It
is now no longer so in the West: whatsoever the type, they will call you
mad.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you are projecting a reality through your own mind, you are
creating an illusion around yourself and then you can see. The
Upanishads are so realistic. They say you cannot see: WHAT SIGHT FAILS
TO SEE, BUT WHAT SEES SIGHT. You cannot see him through the eyes, but he
can see your eyes because he is hidden behind you. Your eyes are just in
front of him. He is you; he can see your eyes. But you cannot see him
through the eyes. He is hidden behind all your senses so he can see your
senses.</p><p>If you go deep into meditation you can see the inner core of your
body, the inner wall. This has been a strange happening, because in the
West it is only three hundred years since medical science came to know
about the inner structure of the body – and that too by dissection. By
cutting the body, analyzing the body, dissecting the body, Western
medical science came to know about the inner structure of it.</p><p><br></p><p>But for the East it has been a strange phenomenon. Yogis and
tantrikas have always known it, and they never dissected a single body.
They know how many NADIS, how many nerves there are. They have
completely determined how the whole inner body functions – but they
never dissected a body, they were not surgeons. How did they come to
know about it? They came to know it through a totally different way.
They became so meditatively silent within that in that silence they
became detached from the body. They became just an awareness inside.
Then they started to see what is inside.</p><p><br></p><p>You know your body only from the outside. This is peculiar because
you live inside and yet you have not observed it from the inside. It is
as if you live in a house, and you go around and around it never coming
to know it from within – how it looks from within. Your body has two
surfaces. There is the outer surface which we are aware of because we
can see it through the eyes, touch it with the hands. Then there is the
inner surface of the body for which the eyes and the hands cannot be
used.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can simply become alert and silent, detached, you will come to
know the inner surface. Then you can see your eyes, and then you can
hear your ears, and then you can touch your hands, and then you can know
your body. But your body cannot know you.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what the sutra says:</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT SIGHT FAILS TO SEE, BUT WHAT SEES SIGHT – KNOW THOU THAT ALONE
AS BRAHMAN, AND NOT THIS THAT PEOPLE WORSHIP HERE.</p><p><br></p><p>Except for your body, there is no temple to enter and search in.
There is no mosque and no church where God abides – he abides in you. If
you can enter and fall back upon your center of consciousness, know that
alone to be the Brahman – to be the ultimate, to be the real, to be the
existence, and do not fall a victim to all that which is worshipped by
people here.</p><p><br></p><p>People go on worshipping their own imaginations, people go on
worshipping their own creations. Then fashions change and when fashions
change, imagination changes. Then you have to create new idols, new
images, new places of worship. Hence, so many religions on the earth;
otherwise, it is absurd. How can there be so many religions? If truth is
one how can there be so many religions? Science is one but why is
religion not one? Why is science not Christian science, Hindu science,
Mohammedan science? It is not possible because science deals with fact.
And if you deal with fact, then there can be only one science because
fact is not a private thing. If you come upon a fact, then everyone has
to accept it; there is no other way. You cannot go on denying it. And if
you deny science, it will be at your own loss. If physics comes to know
a law, then you cannot say, “I am an Indian and I cannot believe a man
who is discovering a law in England. How can I follow an Englishman or a
Chinese? We are of different nations; our cultures are different.” You
cannot say that. A physical law is a physical law. It makes no
difference who discovers it. Once discovered it is universal.</p><p>Science is one, but why is religion not one? If it is also the
ultimate law it must be one – more one than science because science
deals only with outer facts and religion deals with the inner truth. Why
should it be so? There are three hundred religions – how is it
possible?</p><p><br></p><p>These three hundred religions exist because of fiction, dream, not
because of truth. They can exist because they are your creations, not
your realizations. You create your own mode of worship, you create your
own temple. Your religions are artistic creations, not scientific
realizations – artistic creations! You paint your own religion and you
like your paintings and you cannot think that any other’s painting is
better than your own. You like it, so you go on fighting that your
painting is supreme; no one else can paint such a thing. All else is
secondary. You can tolerate others’ paintings if you are a good man. You
can tolerate others with a patronizing attitude thinking, “They are a
little stupid, foolish. Just wait. They will come to the right
thing.”</p><p><br></p><p>Christians go on waiting that Hindus will come to their senses and
they will become Christians. Hindus go on waiting for these foolish
Christians thinking that some day or other they will be converted, they
will become Hindus. How can they escape the truth? And Jainas go on
thinking that all the followers of Krishna and Christ are following
untrue masters. How can they follow a false master for so long? Some day
or other they will come to the right master, Mahavira. They will follow
him. Everyone goes on thinking inside that he is right and everyone else
is wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>This happens because for the masses religion is imagination. They
have their own imaginations; they have painted their own world. It is
artistic. Nothing – is wrong with it. You decorate your house in your
own way; it is good. Who is there to say that it is wrong? It is no
one’s right. You decorate your house in your own way but you do not
fight about decoration. You do not say, “My decoration is the ultimate
truth.” Everyone else is allowed to decorate his house in his own
way.</p><p><br></p><p>You are doing the same thing with your mind. You decorate it with
your own images, worship, prayer, your own Bibles, your own Gitas. You
go on decorating your inner world and then you become part of it, you
live in it. This is illusory.</p><p><br></p><p>The sutra says: That alone is Brahman which you realize when you
transcend the senses, when you go behind the senses, when you can see
the eyes, when you can hear the ears, when you can touch the hand from
within.</p><p><br></p><p>THAT ALONE KNOW AS BRAHMAN, AND NOT THIS THAT PEOPLE WORSHIP HERE.
WHAT HEARING FAILS TO HEAR, BUT WHAT HEARS HEARING – KNOW THOU THAT
ALONE AS BRAHMAN, AND NOT THIS THAT PEOPLE WORSHIP HERE. WHAT PRANA DOES
NOT REVEAL, BUT WHAT REVEALS PRANA – KNOW THOU THAT ALONE AS BRAHMAN,
AND NOT THIS THAT PEOPLE WORSHIP HERE.</p><p><br></p><p>All the temples are false, all the mosques are false, all the
churches are false. I am not condemning them; I am simply stating a fact
– because they are creations of the imagination. I do not say destroy
them, I say enjoy them – but do not think that this enjoyment is leading
you toward the ultimate. Enjoy the creations. It is a good game; nothing
is wrong with it. People are going to the movies, people are going to
dancehalls. Why should they not be allowed to enjoy a religious fantasy?
In their temples, in their mosques, in their GURUDWARAS, they should be
allowed – they are free! And it is better to have a religious fantasy
than not to have – anything. But do not think that you are realizing
the</p><p>Brahman there; you cannot. He is not there, so you cannot do
anything. You can enjoy yourself. – You can enjoy your fantasy, your
dream world.</p><p><br></p><p>If this is understood, then temples can exist. They are beautiful,
artistic creations but do not be lost in them. Go there, but do not be
lost there. Go on remembering that whatsoever is worshipped by the
people is not the real Brahman, because the real Brahman is hidden in
the worshipper. This is the emphasis. When I worship, I am there and the
object of worship is there. Where is Brahman? – in the object of worship
or in the worshipper? The emphasis of the Upanishads is: it is in the
worshipper, not in the object of worship. The object of worship is
secondary; it is created by the worshipper. The value of what you feel
there is projected by you; it is given by you. It is a gift to the
object from you.</p><p><br></p><p>You can put a round rock in your house and you can worship it as
Shiva – it is SHIVALINGA. And the rock was lying in the street or just
on a riverbed for millions of years. No one worshipped it; no one knew
that this is Shiva. The river never cared; the animals passed by it,
they never looked at it. And suddenly you transform the rock. Suddenly
the rock becomes an object of worship, sacred, and now no one can touch
it. And people were walking over it. Their feet touched it for
centuries. Now suddenly you create a pedestal. You put the rock there.
You say that this is Shivalinga, that this is the symbol of the god
Shiva, and then you worship and you feel very good.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing is bad about it. The rock is beautiful and if you enjoy, then
enjoy. But remember, the rock is simply a rock and Shiva is your
creation. You have projected him; you have made that rock into a Shiva.
The god is created by you; the rock is not even aware. And if the rock
could see you it would laugh: “This man has gone mad. What are you doing
worshipping me?” The worshipper – creates the worshipped, the devotee
creates the god.</p><p><br></p><p>The Upanishads say that there you will not find the real, you will
only find the imagined. Move, rather, into the worshipper; penetrate
into the worshipper. Forget the objects of worship and just try to know
who is this worshipper – who is this who is worshipping? Who is this who
is praying? Who is this who is going to the temple? And if you can find
out who this is who worships, you have found the Brahman.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that once it happened that a Zen master, Huang Po, was
delivering a sermon. Suddenly a man stood up. The man said, “I have been
listening and listening for years, and everyone says ‘Know thyself,’ but
I don’t follow the meaning. What do you mean by knowing thyself? Please
try to explain it to me in simple terms. I am not a very learned man; I
do not know the jargon. Simply state the thing. What do you mean by
‘Know thyself’?”</p><p><br></p><p>Huang Po said, “If you cannot follow the jargon, then I will not use
language.” He said to the people who were listening, “Make way, so that
I can reach that man.” Huang Po came down from his rostrum and walked to
the man. The man became a little afraid, uneasy, because he never
thought there was any need to come so near. Is this man going to attack?
And Huang Po looked very aggressive – he was a man like a lion. So the
man became afraid, and others also became uneasy about what was going to
happen. And they knew about Huang Po. Sometimes he had slapped,
sometimes he had thrown an inquirer out of the door, and sometimes he
had beaten.<span class=s4></span>So what is going to</p><p>happen? There was silence, dead silence; no one was breathing.</p><p>Then Huang Po came near. He took the collar of that man in his hand,
and he said, “Close your eyes.” So the man, just out of fear, closed his
eyes. There was total silence. The man closed his eyes, and then Huang
Po said, “Now KNOW who is there.” So the man stood there, the whole hall
silent, no one was breathing, and Huang Po just stood there.…</p><p><br></p><p>The man closed his eyes. He must really have been a simple, innocent
man. He closed his eyes and he tried to find out who he is. He searched
and searched and searched, and time went on.</p><p><br></p><p>Then Huang Po asked him, “Now open your eyes and tell me who you
are.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man opened his eyes. His eyes were totally different; the quality
had changed. The man began smiling, then he bowed down to touch the feet
of Huang Po and he said, “I never thought you would throw me upon
myself, but I was thrown. Now do not ask me because I cannot say. I am
not a learned man. But now I will never ask who I am. I have known
it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Upanishads are trying to throw you to yourself. Forget the object
of worship... just move within. And how can you move within? It is easy
to forget the object of worship, but it is difficult to move within
because there are objects still in the mind which go on clinging around
you. Whenever you close your eyes, there is a world of imagination
around you: dreams go on floating, images come up, thoughts move in a
procession. Again you are in a world. The world of things is no more
there, but the world of thoughts is there. Unless this world of thoughts
also ceases, you cannot know the worshipper.</p><p><br></p><p>And how will it cease if you go on cooperating with it, go on
creating it? You cannot destroy the world of things because you never
created it. Remember, – you cannot destroy the world of things. How can
you destroy the hills, the earth, the moon, the stars? You cannot
destroy them because you never created them! But you can destroy the
world of thoughts because you are the sole creator there. No one else
has helped you. You alone have done the whole work.</p><p><br></p><p>Thoughts exist because you cooperate with them. Do not cooperate –
this is the only technique. Be indifferent. Just look at them without
loving them, without hating them, without condemning them, without
appreciating them, without saying they are good, without saying they are
bad. Do not say anything; do not take any attitude. Just be indifferent,
an onlooker.</p><p><br></p><p>The clouds are floating in the sky. You sit under a tree and you just
see – the clouds floating; you do not take any attitude. You do not say,
“Why are these clouds floating? They should not,” or “They should.” You
do not take any attitude. You just simply become an observer, and you
look at the clouds passing in the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>In the same way look at the thoughts passing in the inner sky. Do not
take any attitude. The moment you take an attitude you have started
cooperating. The clouds in the outside sky will not disappear if you do
not take any attitude, but the clouds in the inner sky WILL disappear.
They only exist because of you. If you are indifferent, they simply go.
They are invitees. You may know it or you may not know it – they are
guests you have invited before.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been very long ago, and you have forgotten that you have
invited them. It may have been in some other life that you invited them.
But nothing happens to your inner world uninvited. Each</p><p>thought has been invited, and now it comes and still you give energy
to it. You can give energy in two ways. If you are against it you will
also give energy. In both ways the thought will feed upon it.</p><p><br></p><p>There is only one way to be disconnected, and that is to be
indifferent. Buddha has called it UPEKSHA. He said if you are
indifferent to the process of thoughts, they will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>Insist on being indifferent. Do not take any attitude, do not choose.
Just remain a witness, and they will disappear. And when they disappear,
suddenly the worshipper is revealed: suddenly you are revealed to
yourself. That revelation alone is Brahman, and NOT THIS THAT PEOPLE
WORSHIP HERE.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

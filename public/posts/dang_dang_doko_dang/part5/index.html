WHEN ONE GOES BEYOND THESE TWO STAGES HE IS SAID\nTO HAVE TRULY TRANSCENDED.'\nONCE A MONK ASKED: 'WHAT THEN IS TRULY TRANSCENDING?' WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD HO-SHAN MOTIONED AS IF BEATING\nA DRUM, SAYING: 'DANG, DANG, DOKO DANG, DOKO DANG.'\nTO ALL SUCH QUESTIONS HO-SHAN'S ANSWER WAS ALWAYS THE SAME:\n'DANG, DANG, DOKO DANG, DOKO DANG.'\nWHAT IS truth?\nThis is the question every man has to answer on his own. And unless a man answers this question he is not truly a man.\nThis question has haunted humanity down the centuries. It is as old as man himself --\nbecause man became man only when he asked this question. Unless we know what truth is, our whole effort to live, our whole to make a meaning out of life is futile.\nIt is ultimate, but urgent also, to know from where life has arisen -- and to want to know the source and the goal, to know the inner running current that holds everything, to know the thread which is the ultimate law of existence.\nWhen we ask the question, 'What is truth?' we are entering into the world of man for the first time. If you have not asked the question yet then you live below human beings. Ask the question, and you become part of humanity. And when the question is dissolved you go beyond humanity, you become a God.\nBelow the questioning you remain part of the animal kingdom; with the question you enter on the path; and again being with out the question you have come to realise that you have come home.\nThe question is very difficult because just by asking, it cannot be solved. One has to put one's whole life at the stake.\nThis is the question that Pontius Pilate asked Jesus. At the last moment, when Jesus was going to be crucified, Pontius Pilate asked him, 'What is truth?' And Jesus did not answer him. Christian mystics have pondered over it. Why did Jesus not answer it? Why did he remain silent?\nThere are three possibilities. One, that the question was not sincere. A man like Jesus answers only when the question is sincere. When is a question sincere? A question is sincere when a questioner is ready to do something about it. If it is just curiosity then it is not worth answering. If it has an intense passion, a deep desire, so deep that the questioner is ready to put his whole life at the stake -- nothing less will do -- then only is the question sincere. A man like Jesus will answer only when the question has been asked from the very core of one's being. So the first possibility is that Pilate's question was not sincere. Seeing the insincerity, Jesus remained silent.\nPilate was a well-educated man, a man who had succeeded -- at least in the eyes of the world. He was the viceroy, a Roman Governor-general. He was at the peak of his career -\n- power, prestige, wealth, everything was his. Whatsoever he had been doing in his life had paid him well. Facing him was Jesus, almost a hobo, a failure, one who had not achieved anything -- at least in the eyes of the world. He had no power, no prestige, not even respectability. He was just at the other end of life, a tremendous failure, mocked, jeered, insulted. Whatsoever he had been doing had all failed. It had not paid him in any way. His life was futile -- at least for others.\nThe successful man asked the failure, 'What is truth?'\nThere are two types of successes in the world. One, the worldly, which is not really a success but just trying to deceive yourself, just trying to keep up faces, appearances. The eyes are full of tears but you go on smiling; the heart is miserable, but you go on showing something else, just the opposite, to the world. They say 'nothing succeeds like success'\nbut I would like to tell you 'nothing fails like success'. As far as the inner journey is concerned, as far as the transcendental is concerned, nothing fails like success and nothing succeeds like failure.\nThe first possibility is that the question was not sincere, it was asked just by the way. The man was well-educated, well-trained in philosophical concepts. He could have asked the question as a philosophical question. Then Jesus remained silent because the question was not really asked and there was no need to answer it.\nThe second possibility is that the question was sincere, that the question was not\njust a childish curiosity, that there was passion behind it, that it was authentic. Then why did Jesus remain silent? He remained silent because if this ultimate question is authentically asked then silence is the answer, because there is no way to answer it except silence. The question is so profound that words will not be capable of answering it. The question is so deep that words will not be able to reach it, to touch it -- only silence will.\nIf the second is the case then Jesus did answer it, but he answered it by silence.\nA third possibility is also there: that the question was sincere and yet not so sincere, that it was ambiguous, split -- which was probably the case because where can you find a man who is total? A part of him was authentically asking, another part was pretending, 'Even if you don't answer I am not in a hurry. And even if you don't answer, I don't mind because in fact I don't need it. In fact, I know the answer already, I am asking just to test you.'\nThe question was ambiguous, Janus-faced. That seems to be more probable because that is how man is and has always been -- split. A part of Pilate feels the truth of this man who is standing before him -- a complete, utter failure but yet his eyes are luminous, yet he has a glow. Pilate can feel it, can almost touch it. Yet another part, the egoist part, is not ready to surrender so he pretends he is asking only casually -- 'Even if you don't answer, don't be worried. It is not my need. In fact, I already know the answer.'\nIf this ambiguity was the case, then Jesus would also remain silent because when a question is ambiguous and the person is divided, no answer is possible. Because the answer can be understood only in your undivided consciousness, the question can be answered only when you are no longer split, when you are one, when you are in a unison, unity. Only then can you understand it.\nJesus' silence before Pontius Pilate is very significant, pregnant with many meanings. But Jesus has answered the question somewhere else, it is recorded in the New Testament.\nSomewhere else he says, 'I am the Truth.'\nI would like you to go a little bit into history then it will be very easy to understand today's parable.\nHomer asked the same question in 850 B.C. and he answered that 'the Whole is\nsupported by Fate and Fate is the Truth'.\nThis is not really an answer; in fact, it is avoiding. When you say, 'It is Fate,' you don't say much; in fact, you are not saying anything, you are simply playing with a word. You have simply shifted the question. It doesn't answer. If somebody is miserable and you say, 'It is Fate,' how have you answered it? Your answering has not added anything to the already known situation. You have simply labelled it. 'One is suffering because it is Fate.'\nBut why is it so? Why is Fate so? No, it is not a real answer. In fact, it is a lie.\nBut one can believe in such things. Many people still do as Homer did. They have not risen above that level of consciousness.\nThen came Thales, 575 B.C. He said that the whole consists of nothing but water. Water is the basic element of truth, of life, of existence.\nBetter than Fate, something more tangible, but very fragmentary. Water does not go very deep, does not explain much. It is reducing the higher to the lowest. Thales must have had a scientific mind -- that's what science goes on doing. You ask about mind and they say it is nothing but matter. The higher is reduced to the lower; the sky is explained by the earth. Mind is a great evolution. To explain the mind by matter is a scientific fallacy.\nThales was the first scientist of the world. He tried to explain the unknowable by something known: he called it water, the liquid element, the liquidity, the flow. But the answer is very fragmentary. It has something of truth in it but not all of it. And a fragmentary truth is almost more dangerous than a lie because it has a certain appearance of truth and it can deceive more. That fragment of truth can become very deceptive -- it can cover the whole lie and make it appear as if it is the truth.\nThen came Pythagoras, 530 B.C. He says that the whole consists only of numbers, mathematical symbols. He has even more of a scientific attitude than Thales --\nmathematics. Meaningful, but mathematics is not life. In fact, all that is very alive is non-mathematical. Love is non-mathematical, you cannot reduce it to numbers. Poetry is non-mathematical. Just think of a life consisting only of numbers -- one, two, three, four -- all poetry disappears, all love disappears, all\ndreaming disappears. Life will not be worth living.\nThat's how it is happening today. Scientists have reduced everything to mathematics. Life is not equal to equations howsoever accurate the equations; life is more than mathematics can ever explain. The mathematics cannot explain the mathematician, the mathematician who deals in numbers is higher and bigger than numbers. It has to be so -- those numbers are just toys in his hands. But who is this player? Whenever life is reduced to mathematics it loses charm, it loses charisma, it loses mystery. And suddenly everything seems to be worthless. Mystery is needed; it is subtle nourishment for growth.\nI have heard two mathematicians talking. One said to another, 'Is there any meaning in life? Is there any worth? Is there any purpose?'\nThe other said, 'But what else can you do with it?'\nThe first asked, 'Is there any meaning to live for in life?' and the other says, 'What else can you do with it?' If life has to be lived just as if you are a victim, as if somebody is playing a trick upon you, as if you are being thrown into this torture chamber, into this concentration camp called the earth, then even if you live, you don't live enough. You slowly commit suicide. You by and by, by and by, go on disappearing. Suicide becomes a constant thought in the mind if life has no mystery.\nThen came Anaxagoras, 450 B.C. and his answer is mind. Certainly he took a great leap from water, number, fate -- he took a great jump. Anaxagoras is a great milestone in the history of humanity. 'Mind,' he says. 'The whole existence is made up of the stuff called mind.'\nBetter, but Jesus would not agree, Buddha would not agree. Yes, certainly better than what others were saying, but Zen would not agree. Matter, mind...Zen says no-mind. One has to go higher still because mind still carries the duality with matter.\nGood, great in a way, a radical step -- from object Anaxagoras turns to the subject, from the outer he turns to the inner. He opens the door. He is the first psychologist in the world because he emphasises mind more than matter. He says matter is also made of mind: he explains the lower with the higher.\nYou can explain in two ways. Go and see beautiful white lotus flowers in a pond;\nthey come out of the dirty mud. Then there are two possibilities: either you explain the lotus by the dirty mud or you explain the dirty mud by the lotus. And both will lead you in totally different dimensions. If you say that this lotus is nothing but dirty mud because it comes out of it, your life will lose all significance, meaning, beauty. Then you will live in the dirty mud.\nThat's what Freud has been doing; that's what Marx has done. They have great skill in reducing everything to the dirty mud. Buddha attains to enlightenment...ask Freud and he will say it is nothing but sex energy. There is a truth in it, because it arises out of sex, but the sex functions like dirty mud and out of it arises the lotus.\nAsk Buddha...he will say sex is nothing but the beginning of enlightenment, the very first steps of nirvana. That's how Tantra was born.\nThese are two ways and you will have to remember that your life will depend more or less on the way you interpret, on the way you choose. You can try to reduce the lotus to dirty mud -- it can be done and it is very scientific. It can be done very scientifically because all that this lotus has was in the mud. It can be dissected and everything can be found, and then the mud can be dissected, and whatsoever the lotus has, everything will be found in the mud -- nothing special, nothing extra, nothing from the outside has entered into the lotus so it is nothing but the mud. If you are choosing your life with this attitude, your life will be just nothing but mud.\nBut the person who says that the mud is nothing but potential white lotuses, that the mud is nothing but a waiting to manifest its beauty in lotuses, has a higher standpoint...the standpoint of a religious man. Then the whole life becomes full of splendour, significance, glory. Then wherever you look, you can find God, you can find the white lotus. Then everything is moving towards a peak. Then there is evolution. Then there is future, possibility. Then even the impossible becomes possible.\nWith the first attitude -- the dirty-mud-attitude I call it even the possible seems to be impossible. But with the second attitude -- the lotus-attitude I call it -- you can see deeply into mud and you can see hidden lotuses there. And the dirty mud is no more dirty mud, it is just potentiality. Then sex becomes potentiality for samadhi, the body becomes potentiality for the soul, the world becomes the abode of God.\nAnaxagoras was one of the greatest revolutionaries, a radical thinker. This word 'radical'\nis beautiful. It means: pertaining to the roots. He changed the outlook. He said mind. He took a necessary step, but that too was not enough.\nThen came Protagoras, 445 B.C. and he said 'Man'. Now his standpoint is more total.\nMind is a fragment of man. Man is many things more, mind plus. If Anaxagoras is thought to be absolutely true then you will remain in the head -- that is what has happened to many people. They have not moved beyond Anaxagoras. They go on living in the head because mind is all. Then mind becomes dictatorial, it goes on a great ego trip. It starts dominating everything and crippling everything. It becomes a destructive force.\nNo, you are not only mind. You are mind, certainly, but plus. Many more things are there.\nA lotus cannot exist alone; the flower cannot exist alone. It will need many more things to exist: the pond, the water, the air, the sun, its connection with the mud, and leaves --\nand a thousand and one things. So if you think only in terms of the lotus and you forget all connections with the universe, your lotus will be a plastic lotus. It will not be a real lotus, it will not be inter-connected, it will not be rooted in existence.\nProtagoras has a more holy attitude, wholistic attitude. Man, and the totality of man -- the body, the mind, the soul -- becomes truth.\nThen came Socrates, 435 B. C. and he said: wisdom, knowing, knowledge. When man attains to maturity, he becomes wise; when man comes to fulfillment, then wisdom arises.\nWisdom is the essence of man, the fragrance of the lotus flower. A still higher attitude.\nAnd then came Jesus who says, 'I am the truth.' This one statement is one of the greatest statements ever made in the world. Either it is the greatest truth ever\nuttered or it is the most egoistic and arrogant statement ever made.'I am the truth.' It depends how you decode it. Ordinarily, when you hear that Jesus says, 'I am the truth,' you think this man is a megalomaniac, has gone mad. He is uttering nonsense. This man is truth? Jesus is truth?\nThen what about us all?\nJesus is not saying that, you have misunderstood him. When he says, 'I am truth,' he is not saying, 'Jesus, son of Mary and Joseph, is the truth.' What he is saying is totally different.\nHe is saying 'I am-ness, I am, is the truth, ' so wherever there is this 'I am-ness' there is truth. When you say 'I am' you are uttering truth. Your 'I am' and my 'I am' are not two things, we both participate there. Your name is different, your form is different, my name is different, my form is different, but when I say 'I, I am' and you say 'I am' we refer to some common experience, we refer to some common root. Your 'I am-ness' and my 'I am-ness' are not different, are not separate, they belong to one 'I am-ness' of God. When Jesus says 'I am the truth' he means wherever this integration is felt of being totally 'I am', there is truth.\nOrdinarily you are many i's. You don't have any capital I; you have many i's, lower case.\nGurdjieff used to say that we should not use the word 'i', only God can use it -- because you don't have any single 'i', you have many i's like a crowd. For one moment one i comes on the top, and becomes the ruler; in another moment it is gone and another i comes over and rules. You can watch it. It is so simple. One moment you say, 'I am happy. I am tremendously happy, at the top of the world' and the next moment you are unhappy, at the lowest bottom of the world, in the seventh hell.\nAre both these i's the same? One moment you were flowing and you were compassionate and loving and another moment you were closed and frozen and dead. Are these two i's the same? One moment you could have forgiven anything and another moment just any small tiny thing and you cannot forgive. Are these two i's the same? One moment you are sitting in silence, in zazen, meditating, and you look so Buddha-like, and another moment, for a small thing, you are nagging, fighting. You will yourself feel ridiculous later on. For what were you getting so hot? For what were you creating so much fuss? It was not worth it.\nBut another i was ruling over you.\nYou are like a wheel of many i's -- those i's are like spokes. The wheel goes on moving, one spoke comes on top -- hardly before it has come it starts declining. It goes on changing. Again it will come up and again you will feel a different being existing there within you.\nWatch. Have you got an 'i'? Any substantial 'i'? Any essential 'i'? Can you say that you have some permanent 'i' in you? A crystallised 'i' in you?\nYou promise, and next moment you have forgotten your promise. Gurdjieff used to say that unless you have a permanent 'i', who will promise? You will not be able to fulfil it.\nWho will fulfil it? You say to a woman, 'I love you and I will love you forever and forever.' Wait! What are you uttering? What nonsense! Forever and ever? How can you promise? You don't know what is going to happen tomorrow, you don't know who is going to rule you tomorrow. Your promises will create trouble for you. You cannot promise because you are not there. Only a man like Gurdjieff or Jesus can promise. Yes, he can promise because he knows that he will remain the same; whatsoever changes in the world will not affect him. He will remain the same, he has come to a crystallised soul.\nNow he knows that his wheel has stopped. He is in total possession of his being. He can promise.\nBut ordinarily people go on promising, and you never see the fact that no promise has ever been fulfilled by you. You completely forget about it. You don't even remember it because that remembrance will be like a wound. You find out ways and means to rationalise: you cannot fulfil it because the other person has changed, you cannot fulfil it because the circumstances have changed, you cannot fulfil it because you were foolish at the time you made;t. And again you will make promises.\nMan is an animal who goes on promising, never fulfilling any promise because he cannot fulfil it -- man as he exists has too many i's.\nWhen Jesus says 'I am the truth' he is saying that whosoever attains to 'I am-ness' is truth.\nAnd this truth is not something philosophical, this truth is something existential. You cannot come to it by logic, argumentation; you cannot come to it by finding a right premise and then moving to a right syllogism and then reaching to a right conclusion. No, that is not the way. You will have to come to it through an inner discipline. That's what Zen is all about.\nNow this story.\nThis story says everything that is needed for a seeker to come to truth, the truth of 'I amness'. It is 'I am' that holds the whole existence together. Moses asked God on Mount Sinai, 'I will go back to my people and I will say that I have seen God, but they will not believe me. So please tell me how I am to convince them. And they will ask \"Who is God?\" So please tell me what is your name, who you are, so that I can convince them.\nOtherwise they will not be ready to believe me.' And God said to Moses, 'Go and tell them I am, I am.' No name, simply I am, I am. This is what Jesus is saying -- 'I am the truth.'\nIt has nothing to do with Jesus, it has nothing to do with any person, it is your innermost core -- which is absolutely impersonal. It is never born and never dies. It is your innermost current of life. It is from where you are connected with God. It is from where you are one with existence.\nThis has to be found, not by thinking but by a great, deep discipline. Now this story.\nHO-SHAN USED TO GIVE THE FOLLOWING SERMON: TO DISCIPLINE OURSELVES IN LEARNING IS CALLED HEARING.\nThis is the first step.\nTO DISCIPLINE OURSELVES IN LEARNING IS CALLED HEARING.\nFirst one has to discipline oneself. What is discipline?\nOrdinarily the word has very wrong connotations. Somebody else disciplines you -- your parents, the society. Always it is the other who disciplines you so the\nvery word has wrong associations. It has been wrongly used, misused. A beautiful word has been very much corrupted. Discipline is not from the outside. Nobody else can discipline you.\nDiscipline is from the inside; discipline is an understanding. And that is the word's meaning also. It comes from the same root as disciple. Can somebody make you a disciple? Think of it. Can disciplehood be thrown over you? Can you be forced to become a disciple? No, you can either take it or reject it. The ultimate decision is yours.\nTo become a disciple means to voluntarily surrender. If the surrender is not voluntary, it is not a surrender. If you are being forced to surrender then deep down you will resist and you will wait for the right moment when you can throw off this slavery.\nThe first Christians, those who had the great opportunity to live with Jesus, to imbibe his spirit, they used to call themselves slaves of Jesus. The first Christians used the word\n'slave' but their slavery was not a slavery forced on them. Even if a freedom is forced on you it is a slavery and if you accept a slavery on your own it is freedom. They were freed by Jesus, liberated by Jesus, and they loved the man so much they called themselves slaves.\nA disciple is one who surrenders according to his own heart. Nobody is forcing him to surrender. If any force is used then exactly there something goes wrong. If you are a Christian because your parents forced you to become a Christian, or if you are a Hindu because your parents forced you to become a Hindu...that's how people are Hindus and Mohammedans and Christians. They have been forced. The parents have somehow conditioned their minds to be Hindus, Christians or Mohammedans. It is not their own choice. Then out of it discipline cannot arise; in fact, out of it rebellion arises, out of it a great resistance arises, out of it your innermost life energy becomes angry, annoyed, irritated, and for your whole life you can never forgive those people who forced you.\nAnd religion is a very delicate matter -- more delicate than love. Just think. If you are forced to love a woman or a man, the very effort that you are being coerced into loving will destroy love. Even if there was love it will disappear, it will evaporate.\nI have heard a very beautiful story about an Egyptian king. He was in love, deeply in love with a woman but the woman was not in love with him. He could have forced it on her but his wise advisors prevented him.\nThey said, 'Don't do that. You can force it, she is your subject. You can simply bring her to your palace, but it will be almost a rape, not a love. You may even get children out of her but you will never get her heart. That is not the way.'\nThe king said, 'What to do? I cannot live without her. And she is not in love with me, that's a fact, so the only way is to force. What do you suggest?'\nThey asked him, 'Is she in love with somebody else?'\nThe king said, 'Yes, she is in love with one of my servants. And this is foolish, stupid.\nShe is blind!'\nThat's what so-called clever people have always been saying. They think of other things: economics, finance, respect and other things -- but not of love.\nThe king said, 'She is foolish. She cannot see the point It is so simple. She is blind, mad. I can give her a thousand and one slaves and she is in love with one of my poor servants.\nAnd I am the king. So what to do?'\nThose wise people suggested a very novel experiment. It has never been done before and I don't know that it has ever been done again.\nThey said, 'Catch them both. Bring them both to the palace and just in front of the palace, bind them both together naked, in deep embrace. And bind them to the pillar and leave them there.'\nThe king said, 'What will that do?' They said, 'Just wait.'\nSo they both were caught and undressed. They were ordered to embrace each other, forced to be loving to each other, and they were bound to a marble pillar.\nAnd for twenty-four hours they were left there to be looked at by the whole town.\nBy and by they started getting angry at each other because the lover thought, 'It is because of her I am suffering this calamity.' And the woman started thinking, 'Because of him.' And because they were forced to be together they started resisting. They wanted to separate but there was no way. They were bound in chains. Twenty-four hours -- just think -- with your beloved, bound on a pillar.\nBy and by, more and more anger came. Then they started smelling each other's perspiration, hot. And then they couldn't sleep. And they pissed on each other. And they vomited. And it became a very ugly affair, a nightmare.\nAnd the story says that after twenty-four hours, when they were released, they escaped in different directions and never saw each other ever again.\nIf you are forced to love, forced to be together with someone, that very enforcement will kill something subtle within you. That's why husbands cannot forgive their wives and wives cannot forgive their husbands. It is impossible to forgive those with whom you are forced to live by the law, by society, by responsibility, or by your own conscience -- but forced.\nDisciplehood is an even higher thing than love. Nobody can force you to become a disciple. And discipline comes from the same root -- it means 'with full awareness you accept something on your own'. It is your heart's desire.\nTO DISCIPLINE OURSELVES IN LEARNING IS CALLED HEARING.\nAnd Buddhists call the first step of learning, of knowing, hearing; right hearing -\n-\n'SAMYAK SHRAVAN'. If somebody has attained the truth, if somebody has attained, then listen to him. Nothing else is needed. Listen to his vibes, listen to his being, listen to the murmur of his inner sound. Just listen. If you can find a person who has come home, then just listen to his calmness, his tranquillity, his bliss.\nBy 'right listening' is meant 'to be receptive'. Learning is not active, it is passive. You are not to do anything about it, you cannot be aggressive about truth, you can simply allow it\n-- that's all. You can simply be there in front of it, in close vicinity, passive, allowing, not resisting, not creating any barrier. Remove all barriers and be in the presence of a man who has attained this right listening. If he says something, listen to his word; if he does not say something, listen to his silence.\nWhen he is not saying something, then too, go on listening, and in his non- saying you will find tremendous expression. And when he is saying something, go on listening deeply, because when he is saying something he is at the same time transferring his silence to you. When he is speaking he is silent also, and when he is silent he is speaking also. A tremendous quality of listening is needed.\nIf you cannot find any person, don't be worried, then listen to nature, then listen to the winds passing through the pines, then listen to the waterfall, go and listen to the ocean --\nwild. Go and listen to the birds -- anything will do. This is something very important to remember: if right listening is there, then even listening to a waterfall will do. And if right listening is not there, then even listening to Jesus or Buddha won't do.\nThe truth happens when you are in the mood of right listening. It has nothing to do with the object of listening; it has everything to do with the quality of listening. But we have forgotten how to listen. Even when we are silent we are not listening. Even when we pretend to show that yes, we are listening, we are not listening; we are doing a thousand and one things in the mind. Many thoughts are crowding in. Politely we show that yes, we are listening, politely sometimes we nod also -- we are listening -- but deep inside us is the madhouse. How can you listen?\nTo listen you will have to drop your thinking. With thoughts, listening is not possible. If you are speaking inside and I am speaking here, how can you listen to me? Because you are closer to yourself than me, your thoughts will be closer to you, they will make a ring around you and they will not allow my thoughts to enter. They will allow only those thoughts which are in tune with them, they will choose and select. They will not allow anything that is strange, unfamiliar, unknown. Then it is not worth listening because you are simply listening to your own thoughts. And it is dangerous because now you will think that you have listened to me. Right listening means to be in a totally receptive, silent mood.\nIn Zen the disciple sits for many months, sometimes years, before he becomes capable of listening. Whenever anybody came to Buddha he would say, 'For one year or two years you simply sit here. Nothing else has to be done. You simply learn how to sit.' People would say, 'We know already how to sit.' And Buddha would say,'I have never come across a person who knows how to sit, because when I say sit, I mean sit -- no turmoil, no movement of thought, totally silent, utterly silent, no movement in the body, no movement in the mind. A pool of energy with no ripples.'\nTO DISCIPLINE OURSELVES IN LEARNING IS CALLED HEARING.\nSo the whole Buddhist discipline, Zen discipline, starts by right listening.\nTO REACH A POINT W HERE ANY MORE LEARNING NO MORE AVAILS, IS\nCALLED APPROACHING.\nThen there comes a moment when you become so silent that the listener disappears. First your thoughts disappear, then your thinker disappears. The thinker is nothing but the inter-link between thoughts, the thinker cannot exist without thoughts; when thoughts are no more there, suddenly the thinker evaporates. When you are listening so totally that there is no thought arising, passing, coming and going, then the listener also disappears.\n... WHERE ANY MORE LEARNING NO MORE AVAILS. This then is the\nmoment where from the outside nothing can be got, learning no more avails, now there is no need, now you are enough unto yourself. This is what Zen people call 'approaching'. Now you are coming home, approaching, closer and closer and closer.\nSo first you are full of thoughts. To drop those thoughts, hearing is emphasised -- hear the Master, or the winds, or the thundering clouds. Listening is used as a device to drop thoughts. When thoughts are dropped one day you will realise the thinker has disappeared. Now there is no longer anything like a listener. The device has worked, the work is over. Now there is no need to listen to the outside because now there is no need to learn from the outside. This is what Zen calls 'approaching'. Now you are approaching home, now everything is within you, you are coming to the innermost shrine.\nThought does not allow you to listen and the thinker does not allow you to enter into yourself. The thinker is the subtlest part of thoughts -- thoughts are gross- thinker and thinker is subtle thoughts. Thoughts prevent you from listening to the outside and the thinker prevents you from listening to the inside. First drop thoughts because the gross can be dropped more easily, then you can listen to the outside. Then the thinker disappears. Now you can listen to the inside. Then the Master speaks from the innermost core of your heart. The outer Master is just a help to create the inner Master; the outer Master is just a provocation for the inner Master to come into full swing, to come into its full being. The outer Master is just a situation so that the inner Master can awaken.\nAND WHEN ONE GOES BEYOND THESE TWO STAGES ONE IS SAID TO HAVE\nTRULY TRANSCENDED.\nNow comes the last point. First you drop thoughts, then you drop the thinker. First the outside Master disappears, the outside object disappears, then you come to the inside. But the inside can exist only with the outside. As I told you, the thinker can exist only with thoughts; in exactly the same way, the inside can exist only with the outside. If the outside disappears, the inside disappears, because they are both two aspects of the same coin. So first the outside disappears, then you come in and suddenly you find one day that the inside is also disappearing, because it is nothing but the innermost core of the outer.\nThey are both together. How can you have an inside if you don't have an outside?\nJust think of a house which has only an inside, no outside. How can it have only an inside without the outside? Or how can it have only the outside without any inside? They both exist together.\nWhen inside and outside both disappear Ho-shan says, '...ONE IS SAID TO HAVE\nTRULY TRANSCENDED.' Then there is neither out nor in, neither thoughts nor thinking, neither outside Master nor inside Master. It is a tremendous emptiness. Nothing is, or, only nothing is. This is transcendence, this is nirvana, enlightenment. Then freedom is utterly complete because there is no boundary -- you are without boundary.\nThis is what Jesus means when he says, 'I am the truth.' This is what 'I am' is. ONCE A MONK ASKED, ' WHAT THEN IS TRULY TRANSCENDING?'\nNow this is a foolish question to ask, a stupid question to ask. Because when there is no outside, no inside, no thinker, no thought, then there is no possibility of any answer. If you have understood, then you will not ask what this transcendence is. It is meaningless.\nYou have come to a point where no question can be asked.\nThis monk must not have understood. So he asked, 'WHAT THEN IS TRULY\nTRANSCENDING?' The question again brings you back to the first step. Now right listening is needed. You see it? The question again brings you to the first step. The monk has not transcended the first step. He has not listened, otherwise he would have understood. He must have been there listening ordinarily. He had ears so he could listen.\nAnd he must have understood these words, because he could use the words, 'THEN\nWHAT IS TRULY TRANSCENDING?' He must know language, of course, and he has ears so he can hear. He is not deaf that's certain.\nBut still he missed. Now the Master has to start from the very beginning. And Ho-shan used to tell this story almost every day. That was his only one sermon. Every morning he will start his sermon the same way.\nTO DISCIPLINE OURSELVES IN LEARNING IS CALLED HEARING. TO REACH\nA POINT WHERE ANY MORE LEARNING NO MORE AVAILS IS CALLED\nAPPROACHING. WHEN ONE GOES BEYOND THESE TWO STAGES ONE IS\nSAID TO HAVE TRULY TRANSCENDED.\nNo question can be asked if you understand. You can touch the Master's feet and\nthank him, or you can have a good laugh, or you can roll your mat and go home. A question is now irrelevant.\nBUT THE MONK ASKED 'WHAT THEN IS TRULY TRANSCENDING?'\nAnd what did Ho-shan do? WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD.…\nIt is useless to utter a word now, because he will have to repeat the same.\nWITHOUT UTTERING A WORD HO-SHAN MOTIONED AS IF BEATING A DRUM.\nMany things are implied in it. With this gesture -- AS IF BEATING A DRUM -- he is saying, 'Are you deaf or something? Do you need a drum to be beaten only then you will understand? Are you deaf or something? Your question simply shows that you have not heard what I have been saying all the time.'\nHO-SHAN MOTIONED AS IF BEATING A DRUM, SAYING, 'DANG, DANG, DOKO DANG, DOKO DANG.\nOne meaning, just on the surface, is that he is saying to the person that he is deaf.'You don't need me, you need a drum to be beaten, only then will you listen, otherwise you will not listen. These things are very subtle. They are not for you.' That is one thing, just on the surface.\nThe second thing: the drum is a very, very meaningful symbol in Buddhism because a drum is empty inside and Buddhism believes in emptiness. Emptiness is virtually the God of Buddhism. A drum is empty but if you beat it, it creates much sound. Buddhism says that the innermost core of existence is empty, only just on the surface is it like a drum.\nYou can go on beating and creating sound.\nAll language is like beating a drum, but all meaning is more in tune with emptiness than in tune with the beating of the drum. All is noise; the innermost core can be known only in silence. All philosophy is beating the drum. If you enjoy, good, you can enjoy, but you will never enter into the really real, the ultimately real. It is empty.\nAnd the third meaning: answering a question in this way is very absurd. Only Zen Masters are courageous enough to do that. You cannot think of any other tradition which is so courageous to use such outlandish modes of expression: Dang, dang, doko dang, doko dang. He is saying, 'Your question can only be answered in an absurd way. The question is absurd, the answer cannot be anything else than that. You are illogical so I will have to be illogical with you.'\nOne great Christian, Tertullian, has said a tremendously meaningful thing. He says,\n'Credo quia impossible' -- 'I believe because it is impossible.' He says, 'I believe in God because God is impossible.' In fact, logically he should not be. In fact, if the world is rational, God should not be. Tertullian says, 'I believe because it is impossible.'\nRationally there is no reason to believe, but life is more than reason, deeper than reason.\nLife is more than logic, vaster than logic -- logic is very narrow. Logic is man- made, life is not man-made -- on the contrary, man is life-made. Life is bigger than man so naturally it has to be bigger than logic.\nThe third meaning of Ho-shan's gesture is that you are asking such an absurd question that it can only be answered through an absurd gesture.\nTO ALL SUCH QUESTIONS HO-SHAN'S ANSWER WAS ALWAYS THE SAME: DANG, DANG, DOKO DANG, DOKO DANG.\nHe had found even a better way than Buddha; he must have had a better sense of humour than Buddha himself. Buddha always kept silent whenever somebody asked a metaphysical question. About something which transcended language, logic, he would keep quiet or he would change the subject or he would talk about something else. But Ho-shan found a more alive way, with a certain sense of humour. Somebody was asking a question which by its very nature was absurd, because by its very definition the transcendental is that which goes beyond, beyond all dualities. We can talk about dualities but we cannot talk about the non-dual.\nLet me tell you a story, a very famous story from the Upanishads.\nVidagdh Sakalya asked a great Upanishadic teacher, Yagyavalka, 'How many gods are there, Yagyavalka?'\nHe answered in the words of a prayer, 'There are as many gods as there are in the hymn to the Vishwa-devas -- three thousand three hundred.'\n'Yes,' he said, 'but how many are there REALLY, Yagyavalkya?' 'Thirty-three.'\n'How many?' 'Six.'\n'How many?' 'Three.'\n'No, how many really?' 'Two.'\n'How many?' 'One and a half.'\n'Now come on. How many really?' 'One.'\nNow if you ask beyond this then Yagyavalkya will also have to beat a drum.\nIt happened. There was a great discussion in the court of Janak, a great emperor and a very wise man. He had requested all the wise persons alive to come to the court and they were trying to define the nature of God.\nYagyavalkya went there, he defeated all the participants and he was just going to be declared victorious when a woman arose.\nYagyavalkya must have felt a little afraid because it is very difficult to communicate with a woman. If you argue with a woman either you are defeated\nor the argument remains incomplete -- there is no other way. Because the feminine mind functions in a totally different way; it has no logical coherence; it jumps from one place to another; it leaps.\nThe male mind goes step by step... so they never meet. The greatest and most impossible thing is to communicate with a woman -- and if you are in love then it is even more impossible. If you are not in love then maybe a certain way can be found.\nYagyavalkya must have felt a little shiver around his spine. The woman asked, 'Who is holding up this existence? Who is supporting this existence?' And Yagyavalkya said, 'Of course, God, Brahma, is the support of all.' He said, 'He is the support of all. He is the ultimate support.'\nAnd the woman asked, 'Then who is supporting him?'\nNow this was going beyond. He had said, 'He is the support of ALL. Nothing is left.' He had said that it was the ultimate, so you cannot ask logically who is supporting God because now nothing is left.\nYagyavalkya said, 'This is an absurd question' -- what in India they call UTEE PRASAN, absurd question. Absurd, because by the very definition of the word 'ultimate', nothing is left. It cannot be asked. If you want to be logical, if you want to be coherent, if you want to communicate rightly, then it cannot be asked. And if it can be asked then there is going to be no end to it.\nHe said to Janak, 'If this question is allowed then it is better that I should stop now because then there is no end. It will become a regress ad infinitum. If I say that God is supported by something then she will ask, \"Who is supporting that something?\" And if I say something else she will say, \"Who is supporting that something?\" It is going to be foolish and endless if it is going to be allowed; it is better that I should drop out of it right now.'\nHe was right, because when we say 'all' then nothing is left.\nHo-shan was saying, 'All duality is transcended' and language can function only in duality. A man has to be defined by a woman. A man is one who is not a woman and a woman is one who is not a man. Matter is to be defined by mind; night is to be defined by day; God is to be defined by the Devil -- language exists in duality otherwise there is no possibility of defining it. The other is\nneeded, and the transcendental means that now there is no other, the nondual has come. Now it is all one, you have reached to the indefinable.\nBut Ho-shan, of course, is a better man than Yagyavalkya. Yagyavalkya must have been very serious; he said to the king, 'I had better stop now because if this woman is allowed to ask, she will create regress ad infinitum.' And he was a little angry also. He said to the woman, 'No more questioning otherwise your head will fall off.' He was right but a little irritated and annoyed.\nHo-shan has more sense of humour; he is not so serious. And that's how an enlightened person should be. About Yagyavalkya I have always felt that he may have been a great philosopher, a great man of learning, learned, but he was not yet enlightened. Otherwise there was no need. He could have laughed. He could have also gestured as if he was beating a drum; he could have said, 'Dang, dang, doko dang, doko dang.'\nBut no, this quality of Zen is special to Zen. It is tremendously beautiful. They can turn an ugly situation into laughter, and laughter brings you home as nothing else.\nThe one cannot be expressed. To know that one, one has to become more and more silent, silent and silent. To know that one, to experience that one, one has to lose language by and by, so that language completely disappears and you are left without any language, without any mind.\nLast night I was reading a few lines of Pablo Neruda -- beautiful.\nSO THAT YOU CAN HEAR ME, AT TIMES MY WORDS GET FAINTER AND\nFAINTER, LIKE THE MARKS MADE BY SEAGULLS ON THE SAND.\nA Master, the more you grow with him, starts becoming more and more silent and his words get fainter and fainter -- LIKE THE MARKS MADE BY SEAGULLS ON THE\nSAND. The more you become capable of hearing, the more the Master has nothing to say to you. When you are not capable of hearing he has to say many things to you to make you capable of hearing. When you become capable of hearing -- look at the absurdity of it all -- when you become capable of hearing,\nhis words become fainter and fainter. When you are really capable of hearing, he stops, because now there is no need to say anything, now silence can meet with the silence, now silence can melt and merge into silence. Now, language dropped, mind put aside, being can communicate with being. Communication can be direct, immediate. Now something can transpire, existentially.\nBut at that moment don't be stupid like that monk who asked, 'WHAT THEN IS TRULY\nTRANSCENDING?' Because his question, if accepted, brings you back to ABC. Again he has to be taught how to hear.\nHo-shan did well. He said, 'Are you deaf or something?' by making the gesture of beating a drum. And he said, 'Sound and words and mind and language and concepts and philosophies and creeds and dogmas and scriptures are just on the surface. Deep inside the drum is nothing.'\nHave you ever tried to open a drum and see what it is inside which makes so much sound\n-- so much beautiful sound also? Small children do it sometimes.\nSomebody gave Mulla Nasruddin's child a drum and it became a nuisance for the whole neighbourhood. One day I was sitting at his home and the child came running in with a broken drum. He had a knife in his hand with which he had broken it.\nI said, 'What happened?'\nHe said, 'The neighbour gave me the knife and said, \"Try to see what is inside.\" So I looked inside, there is nothing.' The same happens with all philosophies. A Master is there to give you a knife to look inside the drum. If you push your knife deep enough into philosophies, there is nothing, only emptiness. All words are empty. They make much sound, that's right, but don't be befooled by the sound. Have a penetrating knife, a sharp knife, with you -- that's what meditation is all about. It is like sharpening a knife so you can put it through all words and reach to the innermost core of it all, which is emptiness.\nYes, Ho-shan did well. His assertion about all metaphysical questions -- DANG, DANG, DOKO DANG, DOKO DANG -- was so absurd but tremendously\nbeautiful. He says,\n'We here in Zen are not concerned with words, logic, intellect, syllogism. We here in Zen are concerned with existence, with being. And if you ask an absurd question, you will get an absurd answer.'\nThe story says nothing about what happened to the monk who asked it. If he had been a little alert he may have even become more alert. This sudden absurd response of the Master -- DANG, DANG, DOKO DANG, DOKO DANG -- may have brought him a little satori. But the story says nothing. The man may not have been even that alert that he could understand this. He may have turned away, thinking that this man was mad.\nThe Zen people are mad in a way because they are trying to pull you towards the ultimate which is beyond you. They are trying to pull you beyond yourself; they are trying to pull you out of yourself. They ARE mad people, but if you allow them they can give you a glimpse of the eternal, and once the glimpse happens you are never the same again.\nLet this story penetrate your heart as deeply as possible and whenever you are becoming a victim again of theories, dogmas, doctrines, philosophies, say loudly, 'DANG, DANG, DOKO DANG, DOKO DANG.' It will be helpful; it will suddenly bring you back to the earth.\nLudwig Wittgenstein used to say that he did not solve philosophical problems, he dissolved them. Everything is left as it is but perhaps for the first time we come to see things as they are.\nZen is a way of dissolving philosophical problems, not of solving them. It is a way of getting rid of philosophy because philosophy is a sort of neurosis.\nDang Dang Doko Dang Chapter #10\nChapter title: Lady You Need Love! 20 June 1976 am in Buddha Hall Archive\ncode:\n7606200\nShortTitle:\nDANG10\nAudio:\nYes Video: No Length:\n99\nmins\nThe first question:\nQuestion 1\nI HAVE TOO MUCH SEXUAL ENERGY BURNING WITHIN MY BODY. WHEN I DANCE, SOMETIMES I FEEL I AM GOING TO KILL THE WHOLE WORLD AND\nAT SOME STAGES SO MUCH ANGER AND VIOLENCE BUBBLES WITHIN MY\nBODY THAT I CAN'T CHANNELISE THE ENERGY INTO MEDITATION\nTECHNIQUES AND IT DRIVES ME CRAZY. I DON'T FEEL TO GO INTO THE\nSEX ACT BUT VIOLENT ENERGY IS STILL BURNING LIKE VOLCANIC FIRE. I CAN'T BEAR IT AND IT MAKES, ME SOMETIMES SUICIDAL. PLEASE\nEXPLAIN HOW TO GIVE A CREATIVE OUTLET TO THIS ENERGY.\nThe problem is created by the mind, not by the energy. Listen to the energy. It is showing you the right direction. It is not sexual energy which is creating the problem -- it has never created any problems in the animals, in the trees, in the birds. The energy creates problems because your mind has a wrong attitude about it.\nThis question is from an Indian lady. In India the whole upbringing is against sex. Then you create the problem. And then, whenever there is energy you will feel sexual because something is incomplete within you. Something that is unfulfilled will always wait and it will assert energy, exploit energy.\nIn the dynamic methods of meditation much energy is created. Many hidden sources are tapped and new sources become available. If sex has remained an unfulfilled desire then this energy will start moving towards sex. You will become more and more sexual if you meditate.\nLet me tell you one thing that happened in India. Jaina monks completely stopped meditating because of sexual energy. They forgot all about meditation because they were repressing sex so much that whenever they meditated, energy would rise. Meditation gives you tremendous energy. It is a source of eternal energy, you cannot exhaust it. So whenever energy arose they would start feeling sexual. They became afraid of meditations. They dropped them. The most essential thing that Mahavira had given to them they dropped, and the non- essential -- fasting and keeping rituals -- they continued.\nThey fit with an anti-sexual attitude.\nI am not anti-sexual because I am not anti-life. So there is not the problem where you think it is: the problem is in your head, not in your sexual glands. You will have to change your attitude otherwise whatsoever you do will be coloured by your sexuality.\nYou meditate and it will become sexual; you look at somebody and your eyes will become sexual; you touch somebody and your hand will become sexual; you eat something and eating will become sexual.\nSo people who deny sex start eating more. You can watch it in life. Freely flowing, sexually flowing people will not be very fat, they will not eat too much. Love is so satisfying, love is so fulfilling, they will not go on stuffing their body with food. When they can't love, or when they can't allow themselves to move\ninto love, they start eating too much. That becomes a substitute activity.\nGo and see Hindu monks. They go on gathering unnecessary fat. They become ugly. That is another extreme. At one extreme are Jaina monks who cannot eat because they are afraid that once they eat, food will release energy and the energy will immediately move to the incomplete desire waiting for it. First it goes to the uncompleted experience which is hanging in the middle -- that is the first requirement so energy moves there. The body has a certain economy: wherever energy is needed first, energy moves there first. There is a hierarchy of needs. A person who has been denying sex will have a hierarchy -- sex will be first on the list. And whenever energy is available it will start moving to the most unfulfilled desire. So Jaina monks cannot eat well, they are afraid, and Hindu monks eat too much. The problem is the same but they have solved it in two extreme ways.\nIf you eat too much you start getting a certain sexual enjoyment by eating, by filling your belly too much. Too much food brings lethargy. And too much food is always a substitute for love because the first thing the child comes in contact with is the mother's breast. That breast is the first experience in the world and the breast gives two things to the child: love and food.\nSo love and food become deeply entangled with each other. Whenever love is missing, your childish mind will think,'Get more food. Supplement it.' Have you ever watched?\nWhen you are feeling very full of love your desire to eat disappears, you don't feel so much appetite. But whenever love is missing, you start eating too much, you don't know what to do now. Love was filling a certain space inside you, now that space is empty and you don't know any other way to fill it than food. You create problems by denying nature, by rejecting nature.\nSo I would like to tell the questioner that it is not a question of meditation. Lady, you need love. You need a lover. And you need courage to move into it.\nIt is difficult to move into love -- there are very hidden fears in it. Love creates as much fear as nothing else can because the moment you start approaching the other you have to go outside yourself. And who knows? The other may accept you or may reject you. The fear arises. You start feeling hesitant -- whether to take the move or not, whether to approach the other or not. Hence all over the\nworld the coward ages of the past have decided for marriage instead of love, because if people were left open to love, very few people would be able to love. Most would die without love; they would live and drag out their lives without love.\nBecause love is dangerous.… The moment you start moving towards somebody else you are coming close to colliding with another world. Who knows if your approach will be accepted or rejected? How can you be certain the other is going to say yes to your need and to your desire? That the other is going to be compassionate, loving? How do you know? He may reject you. He may say no. You may say,'I love you' but what is the guarantee that he will also feel love for you? He may not. There is no necessity for it. The fear of rejection is very shattering.\nSo cunning and clever people decide not to move at all. Keep to yourself, then at least you are not rejected. And you can go on enhancing your ego with the idea that nobody has ever rejected you, even though that ego is absolutely impotent and is not enough to fulfil you. You need to be needed; you need somebody to accept you; you need somebody to love you because only when somebody else loves you, will you be able to love yourself, not before it. When somebody accepts you, you will be able to accept yourself, not before it. When somebody else feels happy with you; you will start feeling happy with yourself, not before it. The other becomes a mirror.\nEach relationship is a mirror. It reflects you. How can you know yourself without the mirror? There is no way. Others' eyes become mirror-like, and when somebody loves you, that mirror is very, very sympathetic towards you; very, very happy with you; delighted with you. In those delighted eyes you are reflected and for the first time a certain acceptability arises.\nOtherwise you have been rejected from the very beginning. It is part of the ugly structure of society that each child comes to feel that he is not accepted for himself. If he does something good -- of course, whatsoever the parents think is good -- if he does that, he is accepted; if he does something wrong -- what the parents think is wrong -- he is rejected.\nThe child sooner or later starts feeling,'I am not accepted for myself, not as I am, not intrinsically, but for what I do. Not my being is loved but my doing.' And that creates a deep self-rejection, a deep self-hatred. He starts hating himself.\nIf you don't fall in love, if you don't find lovers and friends who can accept you, you will remain with that rejection your whole life. Love is a must. You must move through it.\nYou can come out of it one day, you can transcend it one day -- it has to be transcended --\nbut how can you transcend it if you never enter into it?\nSo don't be afraid. And drop all nonsense from the head. Yes, there is fear. You may be rejected but don't be afraid of that fear. That risk has to be taken, only then somebody will come and accept you. If you knock at a hundred doors and ninety-nine remain closed, don't be afraid -- one will open. Somebody is waiting for you. Somebody will be fulfilled through you and you will be fulfilled through somebody. Somebody is waiting to become a mirror for you because somebody is waiting to make you a mirror for himself.\nAnd there is no other way to find out who that one is than to go on knocking, groping. It is risky, but life is risky.\nSo very clever people miss life, they never take the risk. Afraid of falling, they never walk; afraid of drowning, they never swim; afraid of rejection, they never move in love; afraid of failure, they never make any effort to succeed in anything\n-- their life is not life at all. They are dead before their death. They die many times before they really die. Their whole life is nothing but a gradual death.\nLive, and live intensely, and don't take it as a personal offence if somebody cannot love you -- there is no necessity. You were ready, you were available. If the other is not willing, that is for him to decide. Don't make it a wound, it is not. It simply says that you two don't fit -- that's all -- it doesn't say anything about you or about the other. Don't say that the other is wrong and don't think that it is because you are wrong that you are not accepted. It is just you could not fit.\nAnd it is good that the other did not deceive you, that he said,'Sorry, I don't feel any love for you.' At least he was sincere and authentic. Because if he had said a formal yes, then your whole life would have been a mess. Be true. When you love, say it, and when you don't, say that too. Be true and sincere.\nAnd there are so many beautiful people in the world, why remain with yourself? Walk a few steps with somebody. Feel that rhythm also. That rhythm will satisfy\nyou and the urge will disappear. And when the urge disappears, your meditation will be the first in the hierarchy. Meditation can be the first in the hierarchy only if you have not been denying yourself that which is natural.\nA person who has been fasting cannot meditate because whenever he meditates he thinks about food, whenever he closes his eyes he visualises food. A man who is denying love cannot meditate; whenever he meditates, immediately sexuality surrounds him.\nFulfil all natural needs, nothing is wrong in them. What is wrong in food, in sex? Nothing is wrong. Fulfil them. Be so natural that when you meditate there is no other thing waiting for your attention. If you fulfil your natural needs you will see that your dreams will disappear. In the night you will not dream because there is nothing to dream about.\nFast, then you will dream about food; force celibacy on yourself, then you will dream about sex. If you are moving naturally, if you have found a tune between you and nature That's what I call DHARMA, that's what I call the ultimate law\nof life. Find yourself almost always in rhythm. Sometimes even if you go out of step come back again; remember and fall into line again. Remain with nature and you will reach to the goal; remain with nature and you will find God. You can even forget about God, then too you will find him -- if you remain true to nature. Because when lower needs are fulfilled, higher needs arise; when higher needs are fulfilled, ultimate needs arise. This is the natural economy of life.\nIf a person is hungry, how can he understand music? It is sheer absurdity to ask him to listen to classical music when he is hungry. Or to tell him to meditate or to sit in zazen.\nHe cannot think anything about Buddha, cannot think anything about God or Jesus. He cannot meditate, his mind will flicker and waver; it will go again and again to his empty stomach. No, he cannot love poetry and he cannot love music when the first needs are unfulfilled. Give him fulfillment in the first, primary needs -- food, shelter, love -- and then suddenly the energy is released from the lower world and he will start reading poetry, listening to music; he will enjoy dancing. Now higher needs are arising: he would like to paint or sculpt. These are luxuries. They only come into existence when lower needs are fulfilled. And when these higher needs are also fulfilled -- you have loved music, listened to music; you have loved poetry, enjoyed it; you have painted, danced --\none day you will see a new realm of needs is arising called the ultimate needs: meditation, God, prayer.\nIf the first needs are not fulfilled, the second will not arise -- and the third is out of the question. If the first needs are fulfilled then there is the possibility for the second needs to arise and a glimpse of the third to happen also. When the second is fulfilled, the third arises automatically on its own accord.\nJust the other day in kundalini meditation two dogs were watching. After a while one dog looked at the other and said,'When I act like that they give me worm pills.'\nOf course, a dog has a dog's mind. He has his own world, terminology, understanding, concepts. He can only think that people who are doing kundalini either have worms in their stomach or have gone crazy. And that is natural to a dog's understanding.\nYour mind has been conditioned for centuries by people who have not understood your real needs. They have not bothered at all. They were looking for something else and they have managed that very well... they were looking for how to dominate people. And the easiest way is to create a guilty conscience -- then it is very easy to dominate people.\nOnce the guilt exists you will be dominated by one or the other, by this or that, but you will be dominated. A guilty person never feels at ease with himself, he cannot have any confidence; he knows that he is wrong so he goes and finds a leader, he goes and finds some church, he goes and finds somebody to guide him. He is unconfident, hence the need arises. Politicians, priests, have worked very hard to create a guilty conscience in everybody. Now that guilty conscience is creating trouble.\nDrop it. Life is yours. It belongs to nobody else. No politician, no priest has anything to do with it. Don't allow anybody to meddle with your life. It is totally yours.\nAnd your body is giving you the right indication; the body is very wise. The mind is a very late arrival. The body has lived millions of years, it knows what is needed. It is the mind that interferes. Mind is very immature, body is very mature. Listen to the body.\nAnd when I say listen to the body, I don't mean remain confined to the body. If you listen to the body, the body will not have anything to say to you -- things will be settled. And when the body is at ease, relaxed, and there is no tension, and the body is not fighting for something, is not trying to attract your attention because you are not fulfilling a need, when the body is calm and quiet, you can float high, you can fly high, you can become a white cloud. But only when body needs are truly looked after. The body is not your enemy, it is your friend. The body is your earth, the body has all your roots. You have to find a bridge between you and your body. If you don't find that bridge, you will be constantly in conflict with your body -- and a person who is fighting with himself is always miserable.\nThe first thing is to come to a peace-pact with your body and never break it. Once you have come to a peace-pact with your body, the body will become very, very friendly. You look after the body, the body will look after you -- it becomes a vehicle of tremendous value, it becomes the very temple. One day your body itself is revealed to you as the very shrine of God.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2\nFOR THE LAST TEN DAYS I HAVE FELT TREMENDOUSLY HAPPY -- AS I NEVER DID BEFORE. JUST BEING MYSELF AND ACCEPTING ME AS I AM\nFEELS GREAT. SOMETIMES THIS INCREDIBLY GOOD FEELING IS\nDISTURBED BY TWO THOUGHTS. FIRST, WILL THIS STAY THAT WAY? CAN I KEEP THIS FEELING IN THE FUTURE? AND SECOND, WHY DID I HAVE TO\nBECOME SO OLD BEFORE I REACHED THIS POINT? I CANNOT FORGET AND\nSTILL I FEEL SORRY FOR ALL THOSE YEARS THAT I DID NOT LIVE AT ALL.\nPLEASE EXPLAIN HOW TO GET RID OF THESE DISTURBANCES OF MY\nHAPPINESS.\nThis has been asked by Swami Prem Dhyan. When he came just six months before, he was one of the most miserable persons I have ever come across. And it has been a miracle! He has changed totally! Now I can say just the opposite,'He is one of the most happy persons around here.'\nThese two questions are natural because now he is going to leave, he will be going back home. The fear arises. Will he be able to keep this happiness that has happened to him?\nThe future.… And the second question: he feels sorry for all those years that he lived but did not really live, that he missed. He could have lived those years as happy as he is now.\nThe past.…\nThese are the two dangers to be alert about. Whenever you become tremendously happy immediately mind starts spinning its web. And two are the methods of the mind, because mind exists either with the past or with the future. It immediately says,'Look, you could have been so happy your whole life.' Now the mind is distracting you. Say to the mind,'What does it matter? Those twenty years, or thirty years, or fifty years, are gone.\nWhether I lived them happily or unhappily, they are gone -- it makes no difference.' In the morning, when you awake, what difference does it make that you dreamed a very sweet dream or that it was a nightmare? What difference does it make? When you awake in the morning both were dreams. And the night is over and you are no more asleep.\nWhen the mind says, 'Look, you could have been this happy always,' the mind is creating an absurd desire. You cannot go back, you cannot do anything about the past, the past is gone and gone forever, irreversibly gone. Just think, even if you had been happy all those fifteen years, what difference does it make now? Whether happy or unhappy, it is just a memory. In fact, whether your past existed or not, what difference does it make now?\nBertrand Russell has written somewhere that sometimes he starts brooding about whether the past really existed or whether he simply imagines that it existed; were you a child really or did you simply dream about being a child? How can\nyou differentiate now?\nBoth are in the memory -- whether you dreamed about it or whether you lived it, both are part of memory and there is no way to differentiate. The past is in the memory -- real, unreal, both.\nAnd psychologists say that when people say something about their past, don't trust them, because in their past many imaginations and dreams have mingled and mixed. Their past is not factual. And there is no way now because everything is contained only in the memory. Whether you were really living it or you had just dreamed it, both have mixed and melted into each other.\nPast is just memory but the mind can create great trouble, and by creating that fuss it will deprive you of the happiness that is available right now. You just say to the mind,'I am finished with the past and I don't care a bit whether it was happy or unhappy, it is gone and gone forever. Now is the only moment.'\nIf you don't listen to this trap then the mind has another trap for you. It will say,'Okay, the past is gone but the future -- what about the future? At least you can manage the future. It has yet to happen. You can plan for it. And this beautiful space in which you are now, won't you like it to be there forever and ever?' Again the desire will arise. Don't say yes to it because again it will lead you away from the present.\nAnd happiness is always herenow. Happiness is something that belongs to the present.\nNow say to the mind,'I am not worried about the future at all because if I can be happy now, this moment, I can be happy forever because the future never comes as future, it always comes as the present. And now I know the secret of being happy in the present so why bother about the future? Tomorrow will not come as tomorrow, it will come as today. And I have the key to open the door. At least this moment I am happy and I know how to be happy in this moment. All moments that will come will come always like this moment.'\nHave you watched? There is no difference between one moment and another moment.\nTime is completely beyond discrimination. It is always pure now.\nSo beware. These are the two traps of the mind. Mind cannot live without misery so mind is trying to create misery so it can disturb your peace. Then it will be perfectly happy.\nOnce you start feeling sorry for your past -- it does not matter for what you feel sorry -- if you feel sorry, you start getting sad, depressed. And once you start getting too concerned about the future, you become full of desire, tense -- worried whether you will be able to manage or not, whether you will be able to perform or not.\nBetween these two rocks the fragile moment of the present is crushed. So you have to be very alert. When one is unhappy one can remain without alertness -- one has nothing to lose. When one is happy, one has to be very careful and cautious -- now one has a treasure to lose. And it can be lost within a second, within a split second. One step wrong and it can be lost. And these are the two directions in which you can lose your treasure.\nA person who is poor, a beggar, need not be worried that he can be robbed. But a person who has treasures has to be very cautious. When Buddha walked so cautiously, why was he walking so cautiously? He had something, something tremendously fragile which could be dropped in any moment of unawareness and be lost.\nThere is a Zen story. A king in Japan used to visit his capital every night. He became aware that a beggar was always sitting alert under his tree; he never found him asleep.\nThe king went at different times but he was alert the whole night, just sitting there, completely immobile, with his eyes open.\nOut of curiosity he asked the beggar,'What are you being so cautious for? For what are you guarding? I can't see that you have anything that could be stolen or that anybody could cheat you. Why do you go on sitting like that and watching?'\nThe beggar laughed and he said,'Sir, as far as I am concerned I would like to ask you the same question. Why so many guards? Why so much army around the palace? I don't see that you have anything to be guarded. I have never seen a bigger beggar than you. You are completely empty, I can see through and through you. I don't see any treasure there.\nWhat are you creating so much fuss about? As far as I am concerned, I have a treasure and I have to be alert about it. A single moment of unconsciousness and it can be lost.'\nAnd the beggar said,'Look into my eyes, because my treasure is hidden within me.'\nAnd it is said that the king looked into the eyes of the beggar, entered into his eyes and was completely lost. It was a tremendously luminous space. He became a disciple to this beggar.\nThis beggar was a Zen Master and the king had been in search for many years and he had been to many Masters but he could never feel the vibe of the' unknown. With this beggar he could feel it almost crystallised in front of his eyes, he could touch it. Something Divine had happened to this man.\nSo when you have a little treasure to guard, guard it. Now these two will be the thieves --\nthe past and the future. You be alert. Nothing else is needed, just alertness. Just shake yourself out of sleep. Whenever you start falling into the trap, give yourself a jerk and remember.\nI would like to tell you one of the most beautiful parables that has been written down the centuries. Parables have almost disappeared from the world because those beautiful people -- Jesus, Buddha, who created many parables -- have disappeared.\nA parable is not an ordinary story, a parable is a device -- a device to say something which cannot ordinarily be said, a device to hint at something which can be hinted at only very indirectly.\nThis parable is written in this age; a very rare man, Franz Kafka, has written it. He was really a rare man. He struggled hard not to write because, he said, what he wanted to write could not be written. So he struggled hard but he could not control the temptation to write, so he wrote.\nAnd he wrote in one of his diaries,'I am writing because it is difficult not to write, and knowing well that it is difficult also to write. Seeing no way out of it, I am writing.' And when he died, he left a will in the name of one of his friends to\nsay,'Please burn everything that I have written -- my diaries, my stories, my parables, my sketches, my notes. And burn them without reading them. Because this is the only way that I can get rid of that constant anxiety that I have been trying to say something which cannot be said.\nAnd I could not resist so I have written. Now this is the only way. I have written it because I could not control myself. I had to write knowing well that it could not be written, so now, without reading it, destroy, burn everything utterly. Nothing should be left.'\nBut the friend could not do it. And it is good that he did not.\nThis is one of Kafka's parables. Listen to it, meditate over it. I gave order for my horse to be brought from the stable. The servant did not understand me. I myself went to the stable, saddled my horse and mounted. In the distance I heard a bugle call. I asked him what this meant. He knew nothing and had heard nothing.\nAt the gate he stopped me, asking,'Where are you riding to, Master?'\n'I don't know,' I said, 'only away from here. Away from here, always away from here.\nOnly by doing so can I reach my destination.' 'And so you know your destination?' he asked.\n'Yes,' I answered. 'Did not I say so? Away from here -- that's my destination.' 'You have no provisions with you, ' he said.\n'I need none,' I said. 'The journey is so long that I must die of hunger if I don't get anything along the way. No provisions can save me because the journey is so long, I cannot carry enough provisions for it. No provisions can save me because it is, fortunately, a truly immense journey.'\nNow this is the parable. 'The destination,' he says, 'is away from here. Away from here is my destination.' That's how the whole world is moving: away from here, away from now.\nYou don't know where you are going but one thing is certain -- you are going\naway from here, away from now.\nThe parable says it is an immense journey. It is really endless because you can never reach away from here. How can you reach 'away from here'? Wherever you will reach, it will be here. And again you will be trying to go away from here. There is no way to reach this destination. If away from here is the destiny then there is no way to reach it. And we are all escaping away from here.\nWatch. Don't allow this parable to become your life. Ordinarily everybody is doing this --\nknowingly, unknowingly. Start moving into the here, start moving into the now. And then there is tremendous happiness -- so much so that it starts overflowing from you. Not only YOU delight in it, it starts overflowing, it starts becoming your climate, it becomes like a cloud around you. So whoever comes close to you becomes full of it. Even others will start partaking of it, participating in it.\nAnd the more you have, the more you will be drowning into the herenow. Then a moment comes when you don't have any space left for yourself -- only happiness exists; you disappear.\nBut of two things -- the past and the future -- be alert.\nAnd now, Prem Dhyan, you have something to lose -- you are fortunate because you have something to lose. And you have a tremendous responsibility not to lose it. The mind will go on trying its ways for a time being. When you become so alert that the mind cannot penetrate you and cannot disturb and distract you, then by and by the mind starts dropping. Then one day it understands well that now there is no way with you -- so it leaves you. Then it stops haunting you.\nThat day will also come. As you could not believe before that this happiness was possible, you may not be able to believe what I am saying now. The day will also come when there will be no distraction.\nThen again you will have to be even more alert because you will start crying,'Why did I waste so many years with this distraction?' And then you will become again concerned with the future. Many times you will come to face this past and future in many, many different ways. It is like a person going to the peak of a hill -- he moves round and round the hill, the path moves round and round, and many times you come to the same view, to the same place. A little\nhigher, but the same place -- the same trees, the same sky. Again and again, many times before you reach to the peak, you come to the same point -- a little higher of course, but the same point, again and again. Many times you will come again and again to this same distraction of past and future. This is just the beginning.\nBut one day one reaches the peak and when one reaches the peak, all becomes available simultaneously: the valley, the sky, the clouds, the height, the depth -- everything becomes available. That's what enlightenment is.\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3\nTHE OTHER DAY I TOOK A PIECE OF PAPER AND DID A LITTLE DOODLING\nOR FREE WRITING, AND I WAS PAINED TO FIND THAT I WAS FULL OF SELF-CONDEMNATION AND SELF-PITY. I HAD NOT A NICE WORD FOR ME IN\nTHAT LONG NOTE. IS IT THAT I AM TOO IDEALISTIC AND SELF- CENTRED\nAND IS THERE A WAY OUT OF THIS DARKNESS?\nEverybody is brought up in such a way that everybody has become idealistic. Nobody is realistic. The ideal is the common disease of humanity.\nEverybody is brought up in such a way that everybody goes on thinking that they have to be something, somebody, somewhere in the future. An image is given and you have to be like it. That gives you a tension because you are not it, you are something else, yet you have to be it.\nSo one goes on condemning the real for the unreal -- the unreal is unreal. And the ideal goes on pulling you towards the future, out of the present.\nThe ideal becomes a constant nightmare because it goes on condemning. Whatsoever you do is imperfect because you have an ideal of perfection. Whatsoever you attain is still not fulfilling because you have a mad expectation\nwhich can never be satisfied.\nYou are human, in a certain time, in a certain space, with certain limitations. Accept those limitations. Perfectionists are always on the brink of madness. They are obsessed people -- whatsoever they do is not good enough. And there is no way to do something perfectly -- perfection is not humanly possible. In fact, imperfect is the only way to be.\nSo what do I teach you here? I don't teach you perfection, I teach you wholeness. That is a totally different thing. Be whole. Don't bother about perfection. When I say be whole, I mean be real, be here; whatsoever you do, do it totally. You will be imperfect but your imperfection will be full of beauty, it will be full of your totality.\nNever try to be perfect otherwise you will create much anxiety. So many troubles are there already; don't create more troubles for yourself.\nI have heard.\nIt happened that bedraggled, worried Garfinkel sat in a train holding a three- year-old boy.\nEvery few minutes Garfinkel spanked the child.\n'If you strike that baby one more time,' said a woman sitting across from him, 'I'll give you so much trouble you won't forget it!'\n'Trouble?' said Garfinkel. 'You're gonna give me trouble? Lady, my partner stole all my money and ran off with my wife and car. My daughter is in the parlor car, six months pregnant, and she ain't got no husband. My baggage is lost, I'm on the wrong train, and this little stinker just ate the tickets and threw up all over me. And lady, YOU'RE gonna give me trouble?'\nNow what more trouble can there be? Don't you think enough is enough?\nLife itself is so complicated, please be a little more kinder towards yourself. Don't create ideals. Life is creating enough problems but those problems can be solved. If you are in a wrong train you can change the train; if the tickets are lost, they can be purchased again; if your wife has run away, you can find another woman. The problems that life gives to you can be solved but the\nproblems that idealism gives to you can never be solved -- they are impossible.\nSomebody is trying to become Jesus.… Now there is no way; it does not happen that way, nature does not allow it. Jesus happens only once, and only once; nature does not tolerate any repetition. Somebody is trying to become a Buddha -\n- now he is trying to do the impossible. It simply does not happen, cannot happen; it is against nature. You can be only yourself. So be total. Wherever you are and whatsoever you are doing, do it totally.\nMove into it, let it become your meditation. Don't be worried whether it will be perfect or not -- it is not going to be perfect. If it is total it is enough. If it was total you enjoyed doing it, you felt a fulfillment through it, you moved into it, you were absorbed into it, you came out of it new, fresh, young, rejuvenated.\nEach act that is done totally rejuvenates, and each act that is done totally never brings any bondage. Love totally and attachment does not arise; love partially and attachment arises.\nLive totally and you are not afraid of death; live partially and you are afraid of death.\nBut forget the word 'perfection'. It is one of the most criminal words. This word should be dropped from all the languages of the world, it should be dropped from the human mind.\nNobody has ever been perfect and nobody can ever be. Can't you see it? Even if God is there and you come to meet him, can't you find faults with his creation? So many, that's why he is hiding. He is almost afraid of you. Faults and faults and faults. Can you count them? Infinite faults you will find. In fact, if you are a fault-finder you cannot find anything right -- in the right time, in the right place. Everything seems to be just a mess.\nEven God is not perfect; God is total. He enjoyed doing it, he is still enjoying doing it.\nBut he is not perfect. If he were perfect then the creation could not be imperfect. Out of perfection, perfection will come.\nAll the religions of the world say that God is perfect. I don't say so. I say God is whole, God is holy, God is total -- but not perfect. Although he may still be\ntrying.… How can he be perfect? If he were, the world would be dead by now. Once something is perfect, death happens because there is no future, there is no way. Trees are still growing, babies are still born -- things continue. And he goes on improving. Can't you see the improvement?\nHe goes on improving on everything. That's the meaning of evolution: things are being improved. Monkeys have become man -- that's an improvement. Then man will become Divine and God -- that is evolution.\nTeilhard de Chardin says there is an omega point where everything will become perfect.\nThere is none. There is no omega point. There cannot be. The world is always in the process; evolution is there; we are approaching and approaching but we never reach because once we reach -- finished. God still goes on trying in different ways, improving.\nOne thing is certain: he is happy with his work otherwise he would have abandoned it. He is still pouring his energy into it. When God is happy with you it is sheer nonsense to be unhappy with yourself. Be happy with yourself. Let happiness be the ultimate value. I am a hedonist. Always remember that happiness is the criterion. Whatsoever you do, be happy, that's all. Don't be bothered whether it is perfect or not.\nWhy this obsession with perfection? Then you will be tense, anxious, nervous, always uneasy, troubled, in conflict. The English word 'agony' comes from a root which means: to be in conflict. To be constantly wrestling with oneself -- that is the meaning of agony.\nYou will be in agony if you are not at ease with yourself. Don't demand the impossible, be natural, at ease, loving yourself, loving others.\nAnd remember, a person who cannot love himself because he goes on condemning, cannot love anybody else either. A perfectionist is not only a perfectionist about himself, he is about others also. A man who is hard on himself is bound to be hard on others. His demands are impossible.\nIn India just a few years before, there was Mahatma Gandhi, a perfectionist, almost a neurotic. And he was very hard with his disciples -- even tea was not allowed. Teal Because it has nicotine. If somebody was found drinking tea in his\nashram it was a great sin. Love was not allowed. If somebody fell in love with somebody it was such a great sin that it was as if the whole world was going to be drowned because of it. He was continuously spying on his disciples, always sitting at the keyhole. But he was that way with himself. You can be with others only as you are with yourself.\nBut these types of people become great leaders because they create much guilt in others.\nThe more guilt you can create in people, the greater the leader you can become. Because more and more people feel that yes, you can help them to become perfect. They are imperfect so you can help them to become perfect.\nI am not here to help you to become perfect; I am not concerned with any sort of nonsense. I am just here to help you to be yourself. If you are imperfect, beautiful; if you are perfect, that too is beautiful.\nDon't try to become imperfect because that can become an ideal! You may be perfect already -- then listening to me can create a trouble for yourself! This man says be imperfect! There is no need. If you are perfect accept that too!\nTry to love yourself. Don't condemn. Once humanity starts a deep acceptance, all churches will disappear and all politicians and priests will disappear.\nI have heard.\nA man was fishing in the North Woods and one night around the campfire his guide was telling him of the time he had guided Harry Emerson Fosdick on a fishing trip.\n'Yes,' said the guide, 'he was a good man except for his swearing.'\n'But look,' said the fisherman, 'surely you don't mean to say that Dr. Fosdick was profane?'\n'Oh, but he was, sir,' protested the guide. 'Once he caught a fine bass. Just as he was about to land him in the boat, the fish wiggled off the hook. So I say to the Doctor, \"That's a damned shame!\" and the Doc comes right back and says, \"Yes, it is!\" But that's the only time I ever heard him use such language.'\nNow this is the mind of a perfectionist. The Doctor has not said anything. He simply says,'Yes, it is.' But that too is enough for a perfectionist to find fault with.\nA perfectionist is neurotic. And not only is he neurotic, he creates neurotic trends around him. So don't be a perfectionist, and if somebody is a perfectionist around you escape away from him as fast as you can before he pollutes your mind.\nAll perfectionism is a sort of deep ego trip. Just to think of yourself in terms of ideals and perfection is nothing but to decorate your ego to its uttermost. A humble person accepts that life is not perfect. A humble person, a really religious person, accepts that we are limited, that there are limitations.\nLook... that is my definition of humbleness. Not to try to be perfect is to be humble.\nAnd a humble person becomes more and more total because he has nothing to deny, nothing to reject. He accepts whatsoever he is, good, bad. And a humble person is very rich because he accepts his wholeness; his anger, his sex, his greed -- everything is accepted. In that deep acceptance a great alchemical change happens. All that is ugly by and by disappears on its own accord. He becomes more and more harmonious, more and more whole.\nI am not in favour of a saint but I am in favour of a holy man. A saint is a perfectionist; a holy man is totally different. Zen Masters are holy men; Catholic saints are saints. The very word 'saint' is ugly. It comes from 'sanctos' -- one who has been given sanction by the authority that he is a saint. Now who can authorise anybody to be a saint? Is it a sort of degree? But the Christian Church goes on doing that foolish thing.\nEven posthumous degrees are awarded. A saint may have died three hundred years before, then the Church revises its ideas, or the world has changed, and after three hundred years the Church gives a posthumous degree -- a sanction that that man was really a saint, we could not understand him at the time. And the church may have killed that man -- that's how Joan of Arc became a saint. They killed her, but later on they changed their idea. People by and by came closer and closer to Joan of Arc and it became difficult not to accept her. First they killed her, then they worshipped her. After hundreds of years, her bones\nwere found and worshipped. She was burned by the same people, the same Church.\nNo, the word 'saint' is not good. A holy man is a holy man because of himself, not because some church decides to award him sainthood.\nI have heard.\nJacobson, aged ninety, had lived through beatings in Polish pogroms, concentration camps in Germany, and dozens of other anti-Semitic experiences.\n'Oh, Lord!' he prayed, sitting in a synagogue. 'Isn't it true that we are your chosen people?'\nAnd from the heavens boomed a voice:'Yes, Jacobson, the Jews are my chosen people!'\n'Well, then,' wailed the old man,'isn't it time you chose somebody else?'\nPerfectionists are the chosen people of God, remember. In fact, the day you understand that you are creating your own misery because of your ideas, you break all ideas. Then you simply live out of your reality -- whatsoever it is. That is a great transformation.\nSo don't try to be chosen people of God, just be human. For God's sake, just be human!\nThe fourth question:\nQuestion 4\nTHE OTHER DAY YOU SAID THAT EFFORT IS DANGEROUS, BUT HARD\nWORK IS NEEDED IN THE MEDITATIONS. FOR MY GERMAN MIND, EFFORT\nEQUALS HARD WORK. IS THERE HARD WORK WITHOUT EFFORT?\nThe point is delicate. Effort is always half-hearted, effort is always partial. You\nare doing it because you don't see any way you can attain to the result you desire without doing it.\nIf there was any way you would drop the effort and jump to the conclusion. One is never totally in his effort, cannot be, because the idea is of the future, the end result. Effort is future-oriented, result-oriented. One is doing it only for the sake of some future result, some profit, some greed, some good pay-off.\nThat's why Zen Masters say effortless effort is needed. What do they mean by effortless effort? They say hard work is needed but it should not be future- oriented. You should enjoy it. Not for some other goal -- even if nothing is attained through it, it is beautiful in itself. And that is the hardest thing for the human mind to do. That's why I call it hard work. The hardest thing is to do something for its own sake, to sing a song for its own sake, to meditate for its own sake, to love for its own sake. That is the hardest thing for the human mind because mind is future-oriented. It says,'For its own sake? Then why?\nWhat is going to happen out of it?'\nPeople come to me and they ask,'We can meditate but what will we attain? We can become sannyasins but what are we going to gain out of it?' This is what mind is --\nalways greedy. Let me tell you.…\nOne day Mulla Nasruddin was watching the street through the window when he saw his creditor approaching the house. Knowing what the fellow was up to, Mulla called his wife and told her to handle the visitor.\nAccordingly, the wife opened the door and said,'Yes, sir, I know we haven't yet been able to pay you. And although Mulla himself is not home at this moment, he thinks day and night about ways to get some money and pay you back. He has even asked me to watch the street and whenever a flock of sheep passes to go out and pick up any pieces of wool that might have been caught on the bushes. This way, when we get enough wool, we can spin it, make a couple of shawls, sell them and with the money pay you back.'\nWhen she got to this point, the man started to laugh, whereupon Mulla came out\nof his hiding and said,'You rascal, now that you smell money, you start to grin.'\nThe mind is that rascal. Once it gets any hint of any sort of future it starts to grin. It immediately jumps on it, catches hold of it -- you are no longer herenow. Meditation is for its own sake as love is for its own sake.\nAsk a rose why he flowers. He simply flowers. It is so beautiful to flower. There is no motive in it. Ask the birds why they are singing. They are simply singing. They enjoy, they delight in it, there is no motive in it.\nDrop the mind and motive disappears. So at least for a few hours in a day go on doing things for their own sake: dance, sing, play on the guitar, sit with friends, or just watch the sky. At least for a few hours go on devoting your time to intrinsic activities. These activities are the hard work. And I know, mind is very lazy. It likes to dream, it doesn't want to work, that's why it continuously thinks of the future. But mind is very lazy. It only thinks of the future so that the present can be avoided and the challenge of the present can be avoided.\nI have heard an anecdote.\nWhile walking along a creek bank a man came across a young fellow lying lazily under a tree with a fishing line in the water, on which the cork was bobbling frantically.\n'Hey, you've got a bite!' he said.\n'Yeah.' drawled the fisherman. 'Would you mind pulling it out?'\nThe walker did so, only to have the recumbent one ask,'Would, you mind taking the fish off, rebaiting the hook, and tossing it back in the creek?'\nThis was done and the man commented jokingly,'As lazy as you are, you ought to have some kids to do these things for you.'\n'Not a bad idea,' yawned the fisherman. 'Got any idea where I could find a pregnant woman?'\nThat's how the mind is; it does not want to do anything. It simply hopes, desires, postpones. The future is a trick to postpone the present; the future is a trick to avoid the present. Not that you are going to do anything in the future, no --\nbecause again the same mind will be there and it will say tomorrow, tomorrow. You will die and you will not do anything, you will only think. And that thinking helps you to keep face: you don't feel lazy because you think so much of doing, doing great things always, dreaming about great things and not doing the small things that are really to be done right now.\nHard work means to be present and to do that which the present has brought you as a challenge.\nTHE OTHER DAY YOU SAID THAT EFFORT IS DANGEROUS BUT HARD\nWORK WAS NEEDED IN THE MEDITATIONS. Yes, hard work -- because you will have to go against the mind. The hardness is not in the work -- the work is beautifully simple, the work is very easy -- the hardness comes from the fact that because you are so fogged by the mind you will have to come out of it.\nFOR MY GERMAN MIND, EFFORT EQUALS HARD WORK. That I\nunderstand --\nbut all minds are German. That's why everybody is in such trouble, that's why everybody finds his own fascism, his own nazism, his own Adolf Hitler. Everybody does. Mind is fascist and mind looks continuously for leaders, for somebody to lead. It was a surprise to the whole world when Germany fell into the trap of Adolf Hitler.\nNobody could believe it, it was almost illogical. Such a beautiful race with such a great tradition of learning, of learned men, of great philosophy, of Kant, Hegel, Feuerbach, Marx.… Such a great culture with such refined intellect; a culture of great scientists, of great musicians, of great novelists and poets; the country of the philosophers and professors.…'Professor' has never been such a respectable word in any other country as in Germany. What happened to such an intelligent race that it fell into the hands of a stupid, almost idiot person, Adolf Hitler?\nBut this has to be understood: that all learning, if it is superficial, if it is of the mind, is not going to help. The learning only remains at the surface -- deep down you remain childish. Those professors, even a man like Martin Heidegger -- a great philosopher, you could say the greatest that this century has produced -- he also became a follower of Adolf Hitler. What happened to these giants following this man who was almost mad?\nIt has to be understood; it can happen, it has always happened. These great minds are just great on the surface, deep down their existence is very childish; only their intellect has grown, they have not grown.\nMartin Heidegger's mind is very grown-up,.his being is very childish. His being is childish; it is waiting for somebody to lead it. A really mature person does not throw his responsibility on to anybody else; he becomes responsible for his own being.\nNow this whole country of scientists, philosophers, professors, poets, giant intellectuals, fell victim to a very ordinary, mediocre man. And that man ruled over it.\nThis must help everybody to understand the foolishness of intellect. Intellect is superficial. One should grow in being otherwise one is always prone, one always tends to become a victim of such people. They always happen.\nMind is conditioned from the outside; it can be ruled from the outside. You have to grow into no-mind, only then can you not be ruled from the outside. Only a man of no-mind is a free man, independent. He is neither German, nor Indian, nor English, nor American --\nhe is simply free. American, Indian, German...these are the names of your prisons, these are not your freedom skies. These are not skies to fly in, these are the prisons to live in.\nA free man belongs to himself and nobody else. A free man is simply an energy with no name, no form, no race, no nation. The days of nations and races are past, the days of the individual are coming. In a better world there will be no Germans, no Indians, no Hindus, no Christians -- there will be pure individuals, perfectly free, living their life in their own way, not disturbing anybody's life and not allowing anybody to disturb their lives.\nOtherwise, mind is childish and yet cunning. It can fall victim to any Adolf Hitler, to any chauvinist, to any mad person who is bold enough...and people are bold, they never hesitate. That was the appeal of Adolf Hitler. He was so bold that he was absolutely bold.\nHe would never hesitate, he was absolutely certain. And people who are uncertain in their being immediately find a deep appeal in such a person. This is\na man who is so certain about truth that he must have attained to truth. They start falling in line with him.\nBecause of your uncertainty you become a victim to somebody who is mad. But mad people are always certain, only very, very alert and aware people hesitate. Their hesitation shows their awareness and the complexity of life.\nAnd mind is very cunning. It can rationalise everything. I have heard.\nBerger, hiding with his wife from the Nazis in a secluded Berlin attic, decided to get a breath of fresh air. While out walking he came face to face with Adolf Hitler.\nThe German leader pulled out a gun and pointed to a pile of horse manure in the street.\n'All right,.Jew!' he shouted. 'Eat that or I'll kill you!' Trembling, Berger did as he was ordered.\nHitler began laughing so hard he dropped the weapon. Berger picked it up and said,'Now, you eat the manure or I'll shoot!' The Fuhrer got down on his hands and knees and began eating.\nWhile he was occupied, Berger sneaked away, ran through an alley, climbed over a fence, and dashed up the stairs to the attic. He slammed the door shut, bolted and locked it securely. 'Hilda! Hilda!' he exclaimed to his wife. 'Guess who I had lunch with today!'\nMind goes on rationalising. Even if you eat horse manure it can make it a lunch -\n- and\n'Hilda, Hilda, guess who I had lunch with today'! Beware of the traps of the mind. And the more you become alert, the more you will be able to live in the moment, in the act, totally. Then there is no motivation: you do it because you delight in it.\nAnd that's why I call it the hardest work. To get out of the mind is the hardest work. But it is not effort, it is awareness; it is not effort, it is intense alertness.\nThe last question:\nQuestion 5\nFOR ENLIGHTENMENT DOES ONE NEED A HUMAN BODY? CAN'T A DOG OR\nA TREE WHICH IS FLOWERING GET ENLIGHTENED?\nDang, dang, doko dang, doko dang.\nTable of Contents \u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"18750","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dang_dang_doko_dang/part5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dang_dang_doko_dang/>Dang Dang Doko Dang</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: Dang Dang Doko Dang</h1><div class=post-meta>89 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;18750 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dang_Dang_Doko_Dang/part5.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><h2 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=chapter-title-dang-dang-doko-dang><span id=bookmark8>‌</span>Chapter title: Dang Dang Doko Dang<span id=bookmark9>‌</span></h2><p>19 June 1976 am in Buddha Hall Archive</p><p>code:</p><p>7606190</p><p>ShortTitle:</p><p>DANG09</p><p>Audio:</p><p>Yes Video: No Length:</p><p>104</p><p>mins</p><p>HO-SHAN USED TO GIVE THE FOLLOWING SERMON: 'TO DISCIPLINE OURSELVES

UTTERING A WORD HO-SHAN MOTIONED AS IF BEATING</p><p>A DRUM, SAYING: 'DANG, DANG, DOKO DANG, DOKO DANG.'</p><p>TO ALL SUCH QUESTIONS HO-SHAN'S ANSWER WAS ALWAYS THE SAME:</p><p>'DANG, DANG, DOKO DANG, DOKO DANG.'</p><p>WHAT IS truth?</p><p>This is the question every man has to answer on his own. And unless a
man answers this question he is not truly a man.</p><p>This question has haunted humanity down the centuries. It is as old
as man himself --</p><p>because man became man only when he asked this question. Unless we
know what truth is, our whole effort to live, our whole to make a
meaning out of life is futile.</p><p>It is ultimate, but urgent also, to know from where life has arisen
-- and to want to know the source and the goal, to know the inner
running current that holds everything, to know the thread which is the
ultimate law of existence.</p><p>When we ask the question, 'What is truth?' we are entering into the
world of man for the first time. If you have not asked the question yet
then you live below human beings. Ask the question, and you become part
of humanity. And when the question is dissolved you go beyond humanity,
you become a God.</p><p>Below the questioning you remain part of the animal kingdom; with the
question you enter on the path; and again being with out the question
you have come to realise that you have come home.</p><p>The question is very difficult because just by asking, it cannot be
solved. One has to put one's whole life at the stake.</p><p>This is the question that Pontius Pilate asked Jesus. At the last
moment, when Jesus was going to be crucified, Pontius Pilate asked him,
'What is truth?' And Jesus did not answer him. Christian mystics have
pondered over it. Why did Jesus not answer it? Why did he remain
silent?</p><p>There are three possibilities. One, that the question was not
sincere. A man like Jesus answers only when the question is sincere.
When is a question sincere? A question is sincere when a questioner is
ready to do something about it. If it is just curiosity then it is not
worth answering. If it has an intense passion, a deep desire, so deep
that the questioner is ready to put his whole life at the stake --
nothing less will do -- then only is the question sincere. A man like
Jesus will answer only when the question has been asked from the very
core of one's being. So the first possibility is that Pilate's question
was not sincere. Seeing the insincerity, Jesus remained silent.</p><p>Pilate was a well-educated man, a man who had succeeded -- at least
in the eyes of the world. He was the viceroy, a Roman Governor-general.
He was at the peak of his career -</p><p>- power, prestige, wealth, everything was his. Whatsoever he had been
doing in his life had paid him well. Facing him was Jesus, almost a
hobo, a failure, one who had not achieved anything -- at least in the
eyes of the world. He had no power, no prestige, not even
respectability. He was just at the other end of life, a tremendous
failure, mocked, jeered, insulted. Whatsoever he had been doing had all
failed. It had not paid him in any way. His life was futile -- at least
for others.</p><p>The successful man asked the failure, 'What is truth?'</p><p>There are two types of successes in the world. One, the worldly,
which is not really a success but just trying to deceive yourself, just
trying to keep up faces, appearances. The eyes are full of tears but you
go on smiling; the heart is miserable, but you go on showing something
else, just the opposite, to the world. They say 'nothing succeeds like
success'</p><p>but I would like to tell you 'nothing fails like success'. As far as
the inner journey is concerned, as far as the transcendental is
concerned, nothing fails like success and nothing succeeds like
failure.</p><p>The first possibility is that the question was not sincere, it was
asked just by the way. The man was well-educated, well-trained in
philosophical concepts. He could have asked the question as a
philosophical question. Then Jesus remained silent because the question
was not really asked and there was no need to answer it.</p><p>The second possibility is that the question was sincere, that the
question was not</p><p>just a childish curiosity, that there was passion behind it, that it
was authentic. Then why did Jesus remain silent? He remained silent
because if this ultimate question is authentically asked then silence is
the answer, because there is no way to answer it except silence. The
question is so profound that words will not be capable of answering it.
The question is so deep that words will not be able to reach it, to
touch it -- only silence will.</p><p>If the second is the case then Jesus did answer it, but he answered
it by silence.</p><p>A third possibility is also there: that the question was sincere and
yet not so sincere, that it was ambiguous, split -- which was probably
the case because where can you find a man who is total? A part of him
was authentically asking, another part was pretending, 'Even if you
don't answer I am not in a hurry. And even if you don't answer, I don't
mind because in fact I don't need it. In fact, I know the answer
already, I am asking just to test you.'</p><p>The question was ambiguous, Janus-faced. That seems to be more
probable because that is how man is and has always been -- split. A part
of Pilate feels the truth of this man who is standing before him -- a
complete, utter failure but yet his eyes are luminous, yet he has a
glow. Pilate can feel it, can almost touch it. Yet another part, the
egoist part, is not ready to surrender so he pretends he is asking only
casually -- 'Even if you don't answer, don't be worried. It is not my
need. In fact, I already know the answer.'</p><p>If this ambiguity was the case, then Jesus would also remain silent
because when a question is ambiguous and the person is divided, no
answer is possible. Because the answer can be understood only in your
undivided consciousness, the question can be answered only when you are
no longer split, when you are one, when you are in a unison, unity. Only
then can you understand it.</p><p>Jesus' silence before Pontius Pilate is very significant, pregnant
with many meanings. But Jesus has answered the question somewhere else,
it is recorded in the New Testament.</p><p>Somewhere else he says, 'I am the Truth.'</p><p>I would like you to go a little bit into history then it will be very
easy to understand today's parable.</p><p>Homer asked the same question in 850 B.C. and he answered that 'the
Whole is</p><p>supported by Fate and Fate is the Truth'.</p><p>This is not really an answer; in fact, it is avoiding. When you say,
'It is Fate,' you don't say much; in fact, you are not saying anything,
you are simply playing with a word. You have simply shifted the
question. It doesn't answer. If somebody is miserable and you say, 'It
is Fate,' how have you answered it? Your answering has not added
anything to the already known situation. You have simply labelled it.
'One is suffering because it is Fate.'</p><p>But why is it so? Why is Fate so? No, it is not a real answer. In
fact, it is a lie.</p><p>But one can believe in such things. Many people still do as Homer
did. They have not risen above that level of consciousness.</p><p>Then came Thales, 575 B.C. He said that the whole consists of nothing
but water. Water is the basic element of truth, of life, of
existence.</p><p>Better than Fate, something more tangible, but very fragmentary.
Water does not go very deep, does not explain much. It is reducing the
higher to the lowest. Thales must have had a scientific mind -- that's
what science goes on doing. You ask about mind and they say it is
nothing but matter. The higher is reduced to the lower; the sky is
explained by the earth. Mind is a great evolution. To explain the mind
by matter is a scientific fallacy.</p><p>Thales was the first scientist of the world. He tried to explain the
unknowable by something known: he called it water, the liquid element,
the liquidity, the flow. But the answer is very fragmentary. It has
something of truth in it but not all of it. And a fragmentary truth is
almost more dangerous than a lie because it has a certain appearance of
truth and it can deceive more. That fragment of truth can become very
deceptive -- it can cover the whole lie and make it appear as if it is
the truth.</p><p>Then came Pythagoras, 530 B.C. He says that the whole consists only
of numbers, mathematical symbols. He has even more of a scientific
attitude than Thales --</p><p>mathematics. Meaningful, but mathematics is not life. In fact, all
that is very alive is non-mathematical. Love is non-mathematical, you
cannot reduce it to numbers. Poetry is non-mathematical. Just think of a
life consisting only of numbers -- one, two, three, four -- all poetry
disappears, all love disappears, all</p><p>dreaming disappears. Life will not be worth living.</p><p>That's how it is happening today. Scientists have reduced everything
to mathematics. Life is not equal to equations howsoever accurate the
equations; life is more than mathematics can ever explain. The
mathematics cannot explain the mathematician, the mathematician who
deals in numbers is higher and bigger than numbers. It has to be so --
those numbers are just toys in his hands. But who is this player?
Whenever life is reduced to mathematics it loses charm, it loses
charisma, it loses mystery. And suddenly everything seems to be
worthless. Mystery is needed; it is subtle nourishment for growth.</p><p>I have heard two mathematicians talking. One said to another, 'Is
there any meaning in life? Is there any worth? Is there any
purpose?'</p><p>The other said, 'But what else can you do with it?'</p><p>The first asked, 'Is there any meaning to live for in life?' and the
other says, 'What else can you do with it?' If life has to be lived just
as if you are a victim, as if somebody is playing a trick upon you, as
if you are being thrown into this torture chamber, into this
concentration camp called the earth, then even if you live, you don't
live enough. You slowly commit suicide. You by and by, by and by, go on
disappearing. Suicide becomes a constant thought in the mind if life has
no mystery.</p><p>Then came Anaxagoras, 450 B.C. and his answer is mind. Certainly he
took a great leap from water, number, fate -- he took a great jump.
Anaxagoras is a great milestone in the history of humanity. 'Mind,' he
says. 'The whole existence is made up of the stuff called mind.'</p><p>Better, but Jesus would not agree, Buddha would not agree. Yes,
certainly better than what others were saying, but Zen would not agree.
Matter, mind...Zen says no-mind. One has to go higher still because mind
still carries the duality with matter.</p><p>Good, great in a way, a radical step -- from object Anaxagoras turns
to the subject, from the outer he turns to the inner. He opens the door.
He is the first psychologist in the world because he emphasises mind
more than matter. He says matter is also made of mind: he explains the
lower with the higher.</p><p>You can explain in two ways. Go and see beautiful white lotus flowers
in a pond;</p><p>they come out of the dirty mud. Then there are two possibilities:
either you explain the lotus by the dirty mud or you explain the dirty
mud by the lotus. And both will lead you in totally different
dimensions. If you say that this lotus is nothing but dirty mud because
it comes out of it, your life will lose all significance, meaning,
beauty. Then you will live in the dirty mud.</p><p>That's what Freud has been doing; that's what Marx has done. They
have great skill in reducing everything to the dirty mud. Buddha attains
to enlightenment...ask Freud and he will say it is nothing but sex
energy. There is a truth in it, because it arises out of sex, but the
sex functions like dirty mud and out of it arises the lotus.</p><p>Ask Buddha...he will say sex is nothing but the beginning of
enlightenment, the very first steps of nirvana. That's how Tantra was
born.</p><p>These are two ways and you will have to remember that your life will
depend more or less on the way you interpret, on the way you choose. You
can try to reduce the lotus to dirty mud -- it can be done and it is
very scientific. It can be done very scientifically because all that
this lotus has was in the mud. It can be dissected and everything can be
found, and then the mud can be dissected, and whatsoever the lotus has,
everything will be found in the mud -- nothing special, nothing extra,
nothing from the outside has entered into the lotus so it is nothing but
the mud. If you are choosing your life with this attitude, your life
will be just nothing but mud.</p><p>But the person who says that the mud is nothing but potential white
lotuses, that the mud is nothing but a waiting to manifest its beauty in
lotuses, has a higher standpoint...the standpoint of a religious man.
Then the whole life becomes full of splendour, significance, glory. Then
wherever you look, you can find God, you can find the white lotus. Then
everything is moving towards a peak. Then there is evolution. Then there
is future, possibility. Then even the impossible becomes possible.</p><p>With the first attitude -- the dirty-mud-attitude I call it even the
possible seems to be impossible. But with the second attitude -- the
lotus-attitude I call it -- you can see deeply into mud and you can see
hidden lotuses there. And the dirty mud is no more dirty mud, it is just
potentiality. Then sex becomes potentiality for samadhi, the body
becomes potentiality for the soul, the world becomes the abode of
God.</p><p>Anaxagoras was one of the greatest revolutionaries, a radical
thinker. This word 'radical'</p><p>is beautiful. It means: pertaining to the roots. He changed the
outlook. He said mind. He took a necessary step, but that too was not
enough.</p><p>Then came Protagoras, 445 B.C. and he said 'Man'. Now his standpoint
is more total.</p><p>Mind is a fragment of man. Man is many things more, mind plus. If
Anaxagoras is thought to be absolutely true then you will remain in the
head -- that is what has happened to many people. They have not moved
beyond Anaxagoras. They go on living in the head because mind is all.
Then mind becomes dictatorial, it goes on a great ego trip. It starts
dominating everything and crippling everything. It becomes a destructive
force.</p><p>No, you are not only mind. You are mind, certainly, but plus. Many
more things are there.</p><p>A lotus cannot exist alone; the flower cannot exist alone. It will
need many more things to exist: the pond, the water, the air, the sun,
its connection with the mud, and leaves --</p><p>and a thousand and one things. So if you think only in terms of the
lotus and you forget all connections with the universe, your lotus will
be a plastic lotus. It will not be a real lotus, it will not be
inter-connected, it will not be rooted in existence.</p><p>Protagoras has a more holy attitude, wholistic attitude. Man, and the
totality of man -- the body, the mind, the soul -- becomes truth.</p><p>Then came Socrates, 435 B. C. and he said: wisdom, knowing,
knowledge. When man attains to maturity, he becomes wise; when man comes
to fulfillment, then wisdom arises.</p><p>Wisdom is the essence of man, the fragrance of the lotus flower. A
still higher attitude.</p><p>And then came Jesus who says, 'I am the truth.' This one statement is
one of the greatest statements ever made in the world. Either it is the
greatest truth ever</p><p>uttered or it is the most egoistic and arrogant statement ever
made.'I am the truth.' It depends how you decode it. Ordinarily, when
you hear that Jesus says, 'I am the truth,' you think this man is a
megalomaniac, has gone mad. He is uttering nonsense. This man is truth?
Jesus is truth?</p><p>Then what about us all?</p><p>Jesus is not saying that, you have misunderstood him. When he says,
'I am truth,' he is not saying, 'Jesus, son of Mary and Joseph, is the
truth.' What he is saying is totally different.</p><p>He is saying 'I am-ness, I am, is the truth, ' so wherever there is
this 'I am-ness' there is truth. When you say 'I am' you are uttering
truth. Your 'I am' and my 'I am' are not two things, we both participate
there. Your name is different, your form is different, my name is
different, my form is different, but when I say 'I, I am' and you say 'I
am' we refer to some common experience, we refer to some common root.
Your 'I am-ness' and my 'I am-ness' are not different, are not separate,
they belong to one 'I am-ness' of God. When Jesus says 'I am the truth'
he means wherever this integration is felt of being totally 'I am',
there is truth.</p><p>Ordinarily you are many i's. You don't have any capital I; you have
many i's, lower case.</p><p>Gurdjieff used to say that we should not use the word 'i', only God
can use it -- because you don't have any single 'i', you have many i's
like a crowd. For one moment one i comes on the top, and becomes the
ruler; in another moment it is gone and another i comes over and rules.
You can watch it. It is so simple. One moment you say, 'I am happy. I am
tremendously happy, at the top of the world' and the next moment you are
unhappy, at the lowest bottom of the world, in the seventh hell.</p><p>Are both these i's the same? One moment you were flowing and you were
compassionate and loving and another moment you were closed and frozen
and dead. Are these two i's the same? One moment you could have forgiven
anything and another moment just any small tiny thing and you cannot
forgive. Are these two i's the same? One moment you are sitting in
silence, in zazen, meditating, and you look so Buddha-like, and another
moment, for a small thing, you are nagging, fighting. You will yourself
feel ridiculous later on. For what were you getting so hot? For what
were you creating so much fuss? It was not worth it.</p><p>But another i was ruling over you.</p><p>You are like a wheel of many i's -- those i's are like spokes. The
wheel goes on moving, one spoke comes on top -- hardly before it has
come it starts declining. It goes on changing. Again it will come up and
again you will feel a different being existing there within you.</p><p>Watch. Have you got an 'i'? Any substantial 'i'? Any essential 'i'?
Can you say that you have some permanent 'i' in you? A crystallised 'i'
in you?</p><p>You promise, and next moment you have forgotten your promise.
Gurdjieff used to say that unless you have a permanent 'i', who will
promise? You will not be able to fulfil it.</p><p>Who will fulfil it? You say to a woman, 'I love you and I will love
you forever and forever.' Wait! What are you uttering? What nonsense!
Forever and ever? How can you promise? You don't know what is going to
happen tomorrow, you don't know who is going to rule you tomorrow. Your
promises will create trouble for you. You cannot promise because you are
not there. Only a man like Gurdjieff or Jesus can promise. Yes, he can
promise because he knows that he will remain the same; whatsoever
changes in the world will not affect him. He will remain the same, he
has come to a crystallised soul.</p><p>Now he knows that his wheel has stopped. He is in total possession of
his being. He can promise.</p><p>But ordinarily people go on promising, and you never see the fact
that no promise has ever been fulfilled by you. You completely forget
about it. You don't even remember it because that remembrance will be
like a wound. You find out ways and means to rationalise: you cannot
fulfil it because the other person has changed, you cannot fulfil it
because the circumstances have changed, you cannot fulfil it because you
were foolish at the time you made;t. And again you will make
promises.</p><p>Man is an animal who goes on promising, never fulfilling any promise
because he cannot fulfil it -- man as he exists has too many i's.</p><p>When Jesus says 'I am the truth' he is saying that whosoever attains
to 'I am-ness' is truth.</p><p>And this truth is not something philosophical, this truth is
something existential. You cannot come to it by logic, argumentation;
you cannot come to it by finding a right premise and then moving to a
right syllogism and then reaching to a right conclusion. No, that is not
the way. You will have to come to it through an inner discipline. That's
what Zen is all about.</p><p>Now this story.</p><p>This story says everything that is needed for a seeker to come to
truth, the truth of 'I amness'. It is 'I am' that holds the whole
existence together. Moses asked God on Mount Sinai, 'I will go back to
my people and I will say that I have seen God, but they will not believe
me. So please tell me how I am to convince them. And they will ask "Who
is God?" So please tell me what is your name, who you are, so that I can
convince them.</p><p>Otherwise they will not be ready to believe me.' And God said to
Moses, 'Go and tell them I am, I am.' No name, simply I am, I am. This
is what Jesus is saying -- 'I am the truth.'</p><p>It has nothing to do with Jesus, it has nothing to do with any
person, it is your innermost core -- which is absolutely impersonal. It
is never born and never dies. It is your innermost current of life. It
is from where you are connected with God. It is from where you are one
with existence.</p><p>This has to be found, not by thinking but by a great, deep
discipline. Now this story.</p><p>HO-SHAN USED TO GIVE THE FOLLOWING SERMON: TO DISCIPLINE OURSELVES IN
LEARNING IS CALLED HEARING.</p><p>This is the first step.</p><p>TO DISCIPLINE OURSELVES IN LEARNING IS CALLED HEARING.</p><p>First one has to discipline oneself. What is discipline?</p><p>Ordinarily the word has very wrong connotations. Somebody else
disciplines you -- your parents, the society. Always it is the other who
disciplines you so the</p><p>very word has wrong associations. It has been wrongly used, misused.
A beautiful word has been very much corrupted. Discipline is not from
the outside. Nobody else can discipline you.</p><p>Discipline is from the inside; discipline is an understanding. And
that is the word's meaning also. It comes from the same root as
disciple. Can somebody make you a disciple? Think of it. Can
disciplehood be thrown over you? Can you be forced to become a disciple?
No, you can either take it or reject it. The ultimate decision is
yours.</p><p>To become a disciple means to voluntarily surrender. If the surrender
is not voluntary, it is not a surrender. If you are being forced to
surrender then deep down you will resist and you will wait for the right
moment when you can throw off this slavery.</p><p>The first Christians, those who had the great opportunity to live
with Jesus, to imbibe his spirit, they used to call themselves slaves of
Jesus. The first Christians used the word</p><p>'slave' but their slavery was not a slavery forced on them. Even if a
freedom is forced on you it is a slavery and if you accept a slavery on
your own it is freedom. They were freed by Jesus, liberated by Jesus,
and they loved the man so much they called themselves slaves.</p><p>A disciple is one who surrenders according to his own heart. Nobody
is forcing him to surrender. If any force is used then exactly there
something goes wrong. If you are a Christian because your parents forced
you to become a Christian, or if you are a Hindu because your parents
forced you to become a Hindu...that's how people are Hindus and
Mohammedans and Christians. They have been forced. The parents have
somehow conditioned their minds to be Hindus, Christians or Mohammedans.
It is not their own choice. Then out of it discipline cannot arise; in
fact, out of it rebellion arises, out of it a great resistance arises,
out of it your innermost life energy becomes angry, annoyed, irritated,
and for your whole life you can never forgive those people who forced
you.</p><p>And religion is a very delicate matter -- more delicate than love.
Just think. If you are forced to love a woman or a man, the very effort
that you are being coerced into loving will destroy love. Even if there
was love it will disappear, it will evaporate.</p><p>I have heard a very beautiful story about an Egyptian king. He was in
love, deeply in love with a woman but the woman was not in love with
him. He could have forced it on her but his wise advisors prevented
him.</p><p>They said, 'Don't do that. You can force it, she is your subject. You
can simply bring her to your palace, but it will be almost a rape, not a
love. You may even get children out of her but you will never get her
heart. That is not the way.'</p><p>The king said, 'What to do? I cannot live without her. And she is not
in love with me, that's a fact, so the only way is to force. What do you
suggest?'</p><p>They asked him, 'Is she in love with somebody else?'</p><p>The king said, 'Yes, she is in love with one of my servants. And this
is foolish, stupid.</p><p>She is blind!'</p><p>That's what so-called clever people have always been saying. They
think of other things: economics, finance, respect and other things --
but not of love.</p><p>The king said, 'She is foolish. She cannot see the point It is so
simple. She is blind, mad. I can give her a thousand and one slaves and
she is in love with one of my poor servants.</p><p>And I am the king. So what to do?'</p><p>Those wise people suggested a very novel experiment. It has never
been done before and I don't know that it has ever been done again.</p><p>They said, 'Catch them both. Bring them both to the palace and just
in front of the palace, bind them both together naked, in deep embrace.
And bind them to the pillar and leave them there.'</p><p>The king said, 'What will that do?' They said, 'Just wait.'</p><p>So they both were caught and undressed. They were ordered to embrace
each other, forced to be loving to each other, and they were bound to a
marble pillar.</p><p>And for twenty-four hours they were left there to be looked at by the
whole town.</p><p>By and by they started getting angry at each other because the lover
thought, 'It is because of her I am suffering this calamity.' And the
woman started thinking, 'Because of him.' And because they were forced
to be together they started resisting. They wanted to separate but there
was no way. They were bound in chains. Twenty-four hours -- just think
-- with your beloved, bound on a pillar.</p><p>By and by, more and more anger came. Then they started smelling each
other's perspiration, hot. And then they couldn't sleep. And they pissed
on each other. And they vomited. And it became a very ugly affair, a
nightmare.</p><p>And the story says that after twenty-four hours, when they were
released, they escaped in different directions and never saw each other
ever again.</p><p>If you are forced to love, forced to be together with someone, that
very enforcement will kill something subtle within you. That's why
husbands cannot forgive their wives and wives cannot forgive their
husbands. It is impossible to forgive those with whom you are forced to
live by the law, by society, by responsibility, or by your own
conscience -- but forced.</p><p>Disciplehood is an even higher thing than love. Nobody can force you
to become a disciple. And discipline comes from the same root -- it
means 'with full awareness you accept something on your own'. It is your
heart's desire.</p><p>TO DISCIPLINE OURSELVES IN LEARNING IS CALLED HEARING.</p><p>And Buddhists call the first step of learning, of knowing, hearing;
right hearing -</p><p>-</p><p>'SAMYAK SHRAVAN'. If somebody has attained the truth, if somebody has
attained, then listen to him. Nothing else is needed. Listen to his
vibes, listen to his being, listen to the murmur of his inner sound.
Just listen. If you can find a person who has come home, then just
listen to his calmness, his tranquillity, his bliss.</p><p>By 'right listening' is meant 'to be receptive'. Learning is not
active, it is passive. You are not to do anything about it, you cannot
be aggressive about truth, you can simply allow it</p><p>-- that's all. You can simply be there in front of it, in close
vicinity, passive, allowing, not resisting, not creating any barrier.
Remove all barriers and be in the presence of a man who has attained
this right listening. If he says something, listen to his word; if he
does not say something, listen to his silence.</p><p>When he is not saying something, then too, go on listening, and in
his non- saying you will find tremendous expression. And when he is
saying something, go on listening deeply, because when he is saying
something he is at the same time transferring his silence to you. When
he is speaking he is silent also, and when he is silent he is speaking
also. A tremendous quality of listening is needed.</p><p>If you cannot find any person, don't be worried, then listen to
nature, then listen to the winds passing through the pines, then listen
to the waterfall, go and listen to the ocean --</p><p>wild. Go and listen to the birds -- anything will do. This is
something very important to remember: if right listening is there, then
even listening to a waterfall will do. And if right listening is not
there, then even listening to Jesus or Buddha won't do.</p><p>The truth happens when you are in the mood of right listening. It has
nothing to do with the object of listening; it has everything to do with
the quality of listening. But we have forgotten how to listen. Even when
we are silent we are not listening. Even when we pretend to show that
yes, we are listening, we are not listening; we are doing a thousand and
one things in the mind. Many thoughts are crowding in. Politely we show
that yes, we are listening, politely sometimes we nod also -- we are
listening -- but deep inside us is the madhouse. How can you listen?</p><p>To listen you will have to drop your thinking. With thoughts,
listening is not possible. If you are speaking inside and I am speaking
here, how can you listen to me? Because you are closer to yourself than
me, your thoughts will be closer to you, they will make a ring around
you and they will not allow my thoughts to enter. They will allow only
those thoughts which are in tune with them, they will choose and select.
They will not allow anything that is strange, unfamiliar, unknown. Then
it is not worth listening because you are simply listening to your own
thoughts. And it is dangerous because now you will think that you have
listened to me. Right listening means to be in a totally receptive,
silent mood.</p><p>In Zen the disciple sits for many months, sometimes years, before he
becomes capable of listening. Whenever anybody came to Buddha he would
say, 'For one year or two years you simply sit here. Nothing else has to
be done. You simply learn how to sit.' People would say, 'We know
already how to sit.' And Buddha would say,'I have never come across a
person who knows how to sit, because when I say sit, I mean sit -- no
turmoil, no movement of thought, totally silent, utterly silent, no
movement in the body, no movement in the mind. A pool of energy with no
ripples.'</p><p>TO DISCIPLINE OURSELVES IN LEARNING IS CALLED HEARING.</p><p>So the whole Buddhist discipline, Zen discipline, starts by right
listening.</p><p>TO REACH A POINT W HERE ANY MORE LEARNING NO MORE AVAILS, IS</p><p>CALLED APPROACHING.</p><p>Then there comes a moment when you become so silent that the listener
disappears. First your thoughts disappear, then your thinker disappears.
The thinker is nothing but the inter-link between thoughts, the thinker
cannot exist without thoughts; when thoughts are no more there, suddenly
the thinker evaporates. When you are listening so totally that there is
no thought arising, passing, coming and going, then the listener also
disappears.</p><p>... WHERE ANY MORE LEARNING NO MORE AVAILS. This then is the</p><p>moment where from the outside nothing can be got, learning no more
avails, now there is no need, now you are enough unto yourself. This is
what Zen people call 'approaching'. Now you are coming home,
approaching, closer and closer and closer.</p><p>So first you are full of thoughts. To drop those thoughts, hearing is
emphasised -- hear the Master, or the winds, or the thundering clouds.
Listening is used as a device to drop thoughts. When thoughts are
dropped one day you will realise the thinker has disappeared. Now there
is no longer anything like a listener. The device has worked, the work
is over. Now there is no need to listen to the outside because now there
is no need to learn from the outside. This is what Zen calls
'approaching'. Now you are approaching home, now everything is within
you, you are coming to the innermost shrine.</p><p>Thought does not allow you to listen and the thinker does not allow
you to enter into yourself. The thinker is the subtlest part of thoughts
-- thoughts are gross- thinker and thinker is subtle thoughts. Thoughts
prevent you from listening to the outside and the thinker prevents you
from listening to the inside. First drop thoughts because the gross can
be dropped more easily, then you can listen to the outside. Then the
thinker disappears. Now you can listen to the inside. Then the Master
speaks from the innermost core of your heart. The outer Master is just a
help to create the inner Master; the outer Master is just a provocation
for the inner Master to come into full swing, to come into its full
being. The outer Master is just a situation so that the inner Master can
awaken.</p><p>AND WHEN ONE GOES BEYOND THESE TWO STAGES ONE IS SAID TO HAVE</p><p>TRULY TRANSCENDED.</p><p>Now comes the last point. First you drop thoughts, then you drop the
thinker. First the outside Master disappears, the outside object
disappears, then you come to the inside. But the inside can exist only
with the outside. As I told you, the thinker can exist only with
thoughts; in exactly the same way, the inside can exist only with the
outside. If the outside disappears, the inside disappears, because they
are both two aspects of the same coin. So first the outside disappears,
then you come in and suddenly you find one day that the inside is also
disappearing, because it is nothing but the innermost core of the
outer.</p><p>They are both together. How can you have an inside if you don't have
an outside?</p><p>Just think of a house which has only an inside, no outside. How can
it have only an inside without the outside? Or how can it have only the
outside without any inside? They both exist together.</p><p>When inside and outside both disappear Ho-shan says, '...ONE IS SAID
TO HAVE</p><p>TRULY TRANSCENDED.' Then there is neither out nor in, neither
thoughts nor thinking, neither outside Master nor inside Master. It is a
tremendous emptiness. Nothing is, or, only nothing is. This is
transcendence, this is nirvana, enlightenment. Then freedom is utterly
complete because there is no boundary -- you are without boundary.</p><p>This is what Jesus means when he says, 'I am the truth.' This is what
'I am' is. ONCE A MONK ASKED, ' WHAT THEN IS TRULY TRANSCENDING?'</p><p>Now this is a foolish question to ask, a stupid question to ask.
Because when there is no outside, no inside, no thinker, no thought,
then there is no possibility of any answer. If you have understood, then
you will not ask what this transcendence is. It is meaningless.</p><p>You have come to a point where no question can be asked.</p><p>This monk must not have understood. So he asked, 'WHAT THEN IS
TRULY</p><p>TRANSCENDING?' The question again brings you back to the first step.
Now right listening is needed. You see it? The question again brings you
to the first step. The monk has not transcended the first step. He has
not listened, otherwise he would have understood. He must have been
there listening ordinarily. He had ears so he could listen.</p><p>And he must have understood these words, because he could use the
words, 'THEN</p><p>WHAT IS TRULY TRANSCENDING?' He must know language, of course, and he
has ears so he can hear. He is not deaf that's certain.</p><p>But still he missed. Now the Master has to start from the very
beginning. And Ho-shan used to tell this story almost every day. That
was his only one sermon. Every morning he will start his sermon the same
way.</p><p>TO DISCIPLINE OURSELVES IN LEARNING IS CALLED HEARING. TO REACH</p><p>A POINT WHERE ANY MORE LEARNING NO MORE AVAILS IS CALLED</p><p>APPROACHING. WHEN ONE GOES BEYOND THESE TWO STAGES ONE IS</p><p>SAID TO HAVE TRULY TRANSCENDED.</p><p>No question can be asked if you understand. You can touch the
Master's feet and</p><p>thank him, or you can have a good laugh, or you can roll your mat and
go home. A question is now irrelevant.</p><p>BUT THE MONK ASKED 'WHAT THEN IS TRULY TRANSCENDING?'</p><p>And what did Ho-shan do? WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD.…</p><p>It is useless to utter a word now, because he will have to repeat the
same.</p><p>WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD HO-SHAN MOTIONED AS IF BEATING A DRUM.</p><p>Many things are implied in it. With this gesture -- AS IF BEATING A
DRUM -- he is saying, 'Are you deaf or something? Do you need a drum to
be beaten only then you will understand? Are you deaf or something? Your
question simply shows that you have not heard what I have been saying
all the time.'</p><p>HO-SHAN MOTIONED AS IF BEATING A DRUM, SAYING, 'DANG, DANG, DOKO
DANG, DOKO DANG.</p><p>One meaning, just on the surface, is that he is saying to the person
that he is deaf.'You don't need me, you need a drum to be beaten, only
then will you listen, otherwise you will not listen. These things are
very subtle. They are not for you.' That is one thing, just on the
surface.</p><p>The second thing: the drum is a very, very meaningful symbol in
Buddhism because a drum is empty inside and Buddhism believes in
emptiness. Emptiness is virtually the God of Buddhism. A drum is empty
but if you beat it, it creates much sound. Buddhism says that the
innermost core of existence is empty, only just on the surface is it
like a drum.</p><p>You can go on beating and creating sound.</p><p>All language is like beating a drum, but all meaning is more in tune
with emptiness than in tune with the beating of the drum. All is noise;
the innermost core can be known only in silence. All philosophy is
beating the drum. If you enjoy, good, you can enjoy, but you will never
enter into the really real, the ultimately real. It is empty.</p><p>And the third meaning: answering a question in this way is very
absurd. Only Zen Masters are courageous enough to do that. You cannot
think of any other tradition which is so courageous to use such
outlandish modes of expression: Dang, dang, doko dang, doko dang. He is
saying, 'Your question can only be answered in an absurd way. The
question is absurd, the answer cannot be anything else than that. You
are illogical so I will have to be illogical with you.'</p><p>One great Christian, Tertullian, has said a tremendously meaningful
thing. He says,</p><p>'Credo quia impossible' -- 'I believe because it is impossible.' He
says, 'I believe in God because God is impossible.' In fact, logically
he should not be. In fact, if the world is rational, God should not be.
Tertullian says, 'I believe because it is impossible.'</p><p>Rationally there is no reason to believe, but life is more than
reason, deeper than reason.</p><p>Life is more than logic, vaster than logic -- logic is very narrow.
Logic is man- made, life is not man-made -- on the contrary, man is
life-made. Life is bigger than man so naturally it has to be bigger than
logic.</p><p>The third meaning of Ho-shan's gesture is that you are asking such an
absurd question that it can only be answered through an absurd
gesture.</p><p>TO ALL SUCH QUESTIONS HO-SHAN'S ANSWER WAS ALWAYS THE SAME: DANG,
DANG, DOKO DANG, DOKO DANG.</p><p>He had found even a better way than Buddha; he must have had a better
sense of humour than Buddha himself. Buddha always kept silent whenever
somebody asked a metaphysical question. About something which
transcended language, logic, he would keep quiet or he would change the
subject or he would talk about something else. But Ho-shan found a more
alive way, with a certain sense of humour. Somebody was asking a
question which by its very nature was absurd, because by its very
definition the transcendental is that which goes beyond, beyond all
dualities. We can talk about dualities but we cannot talk about the
non-dual.</p><p>Let me tell you a story, a very famous story from the Upanishads.</p><p>Vidagdh Sakalya asked a great Upanishadic teacher, Yagyavalka, 'How
many gods are there, Yagyavalka?'</p><p>He answered in the words of a prayer, 'There are as many gods as
there are in the hymn to the Vishwa-devas -- three thousand three
hundred.'</p><p>'Yes,' he said, 'but how many are there REALLY, Yagyavalkya?'
'Thirty-three.'</p><p>'How many?' 'Six.'</p><p>'How many?' 'Three.'</p><p>'No, how many really?' 'Two.'</p><p>'How many?' 'One and a half.'</p><p>'Now come on. How many really?' 'One.'</p><p>Now if you ask beyond this then Yagyavalkya will also have to beat a
drum.</p><p>It happened. There was a great discussion in the court of Janak, a
great emperor and a very wise man. He had requested all the wise persons
alive to come to the court and they were trying to define the nature of
God.</p><p>Yagyavalkya went there, he defeated all the participants and he was
just going to be declared victorious when a woman arose.</p><p>Yagyavalkya must have felt a little afraid because it is very
difficult to communicate with a woman. If you argue with a woman either
you are defeated</p><p>or the argument remains incomplete -- there is no other way. Because
the feminine mind functions in a totally different way; it has no
logical coherence; it jumps from one place to another; it leaps.</p><p>The male mind goes step by step... so they never meet. The greatest
and most impossible thing is to communicate with a woman -- and if you
are in love then it is even more impossible. If you are not in love then
maybe a certain way can be found.</p><p>Yagyavalkya must have felt a little shiver around his spine. The
woman asked, 'Who is holding up this existence? Who is supporting this
existence?' And Yagyavalkya said, 'Of course, God, Brahma, is the
support of all.' He said, 'He is the support of all. He is the ultimate
support.'</p><p>And the woman asked, 'Then who is supporting him?'</p><p>Now this was going beyond. He had said, 'He is the support of ALL.
Nothing is left.' He had said that it was the ultimate, so you cannot
ask logically who is supporting God because now nothing is left.</p><p>Yagyavalkya said, 'This is an absurd question' -- what in India they
call UTEE PRASAN, absurd question. Absurd, because by the very
definition of the word 'ultimate', nothing is left. It cannot be asked.
If you want to be logical, if you want to be coherent, if you want to
communicate rightly, then it cannot be asked. And if it can be asked
then there is going to be no end to it.</p><p>He said to Janak, 'If this question is allowed then it is better that
I should stop now because then there is no end. It will become a regress
ad infinitum. If I say that God is supported by something then she will
ask, "Who is supporting that something?" And if I say something else she
will say, "Who is supporting that something?" It is going to be foolish
and endless if it is going to be allowed; it is better that I should
drop out of it right now.'</p><p>He was right, because when we say 'all' then nothing is left.</p><p>Ho-shan was saying, 'All duality is transcended' and language can
function only in duality. A man has to be defined by a woman. A man is
one who is not a woman and a woman is one who is not a man. Matter is to
be defined by mind; night is to be defined by day; God is to be defined
by the Devil -- language exists in duality otherwise there is no
possibility of defining it. The other is</p><p>needed, and the transcendental means that now there is no other, the
nondual has come. Now it is all one, you have reached to the
indefinable.</p><p>But Ho-shan, of course, is a better man than Yagyavalkya. Yagyavalkya
must have been very serious; he said to the king, 'I had better stop now
because if this woman is allowed to ask, she will create regress ad
infinitum.' And he was a little angry also. He said to the woman, 'No
more questioning otherwise your head will fall off.' He was right but a
little irritated and annoyed.</p><p>Ho-shan has more sense of humour; he is not so serious. And that's
how an enlightened person should be. About Yagyavalkya I have always
felt that he may have been a great philosopher, a great man of learning,
learned, but he was not yet enlightened. Otherwise there was no need. He
could have laughed. He could have also gestured as if he was beating a
drum; he could have said, 'Dang, dang, doko dang, doko dang.'</p><p>But no, this quality of Zen is special to Zen. It is tremendously
beautiful. They can turn an ugly situation into laughter, and laughter
brings you home as nothing else.</p><p>The one cannot be expressed. To know that one, one has to become more
and more silent, silent and silent. To know that one, to experience that
one, one has to lose language by and by, so that language completely
disappears and you are left without any language, without any mind.</p><p>Last night I was reading a few lines of Pablo Neruda --
beautiful.</p><p>SO THAT YOU CAN HEAR ME, AT TIMES MY WORDS GET FAINTER AND</p><p>FAINTER, LIKE THE MARKS MADE BY SEAGULLS ON THE SAND.</p><p>A Master, the more you grow with him, starts becoming more and more
silent and his words get fainter and fainter -- LIKE THE MARKS MADE BY
SEAGULLS ON THE</p><p>SAND. The more you become capable of hearing, the more the Master has
nothing to say to you. When you are not capable of hearing he has to say
many things to you to make you capable of hearing. When you become
capable of hearing -- look at the absurdity of it all -- when you become
capable of hearing,</p><p>his words become fainter and fainter. When you are really capable of
hearing, he stops, because now there is no need to say anything, now
silence can meet with the silence, now silence can melt and merge into
silence. Now, language dropped, mind put aside, being can communicate
with being. Communication can be direct, immediate. Now something can
transpire, existentially.</p><p>But at that moment don't be stupid like that monk who asked, 'WHAT
THEN IS TRULY</p><p>TRANSCENDING?' Because his question, if accepted, brings you back to
ABC. Again he has to be taught how to hear.</p><p>Ho-shan did well. He said, 'Are you deaf or something?' by making the
gesture of beating a drum. And he said, 'Sound and words and mind and
language and concepts and philosophies and creeds and dogmas and
scriptures are just on the surface. Deep inside the drum is
nothing.'</p><p>Have you ever tried to open a drum and see what it is inside which
makes so much sound</p><p>-- so much beautiful sound also? Small children do it sometimes.</p><p>Somebody gave Mulla Nasruddin's child a drum and it became a nuisance
for the whole neighbourhood. One day I was sitting at his home and the
child came running in with a broken drum. He had a knife in his hand
with which he had broken it.</p><p>I said, 'What happened?'</p><p>He said, 'The neighbour gave me the knife and said, "Try to see what
is inside." So I looked inside, there is nothing.' The same happens with
all philosophies. A Master is there to give you a knife to look inside
the drum. If you push your knife deep enough into philosophies, there is
nothing, only emptiness. All words are empty. They make much sound,
that's right, but don't be befooled by the sound. Have a penetrating
knife, a sharp knife, with you -- that's what meditation is all about.
It is like sharpening a knife so you can put it through all words and
reach to the innermost core of it all, which is emptiness.</p><p>Yes, Ho-shan did well. His assertion about all metaphysical questions
-- DANG, DANG, DOKO DANG, DOKO DANG -- was so absurd but
tremendously</p><p>beautiful. He says,</p><p>'We here in Zen are not concerned with words, logic, intellect,
syllogism. We here in Zen are concerned with existence, with being. And
if you ask an absurd question, you will get an absurd answer.'</p><p>The story says nothing about what happened to the monk who asked it.
If he had been a little alert he may have even become more alert. This
sudden absurd response of the Master -- DANG, DANG, DOKO DANG, DOKO DANG
-- may have brought him a little satori. But the story says nothing. The
man may not have been even that alert that he could understand this. He
may have turned away, thinking that this man was mad.</p><p>The Zen people are mad in a way because they are trying to pull you
towards the ultimate which is beyond you. They are trying to pull you
beyond yourself; they are trying to pull you out of yourself. They ARE
mad people, but if you allow them they can give you a glimpse of the
eternal, and once the glimpse happens you are never the same again.</p><p>Let this story penetrate your heart as deeply as possible and
whenever you are becoming a victim again of theories, dogmas, doctrines,
philosophies, say loudly, 'DANG, DANG, DOKO DANG, DOKO DANG.' It will be
helpful; it will suddenly bring you back to the earth.</p><p>Ludwig Wittgenstein used to say that he did not solve philosophical
problems, he dissolved them. Everything is left as it is but perhaps for
the first time we come to see things as they are.</p><p>Zen is a way of dissolving philosophical problems, not of solving
them. It is a way of getting rid of philosophy because philosophy is a
sort of neurosis.</p><p>Dang Dang Doko Dang Chapter #10</p><p>Chapter title: Lady You Need Love! 20 June 1976 am in Buddha Hall

SOMETIMES I FEEL I AM GOING TO KILL THE WHOLE WORLD AND</p><p>AT SOME STAGES SO MUCH ANGER AND VIOLENCE BUBBLES WITHIN MY</p><p>BODY THAT I CAN'T CHANNELISE THE ENERGY INTO MEDITATION</p><p>TECHNIQUES AND IT DRIVES ME CRAZY. I DON'T FEEL TO GO INTO THE</p><p>SEX ACT BUT VIOLENT ENERGY IS STILL BURNING LIKE VOLCANIC FIRE. I
CAN'T BEAR IT AND IT MAKES, ME SOMETIMES SUICIDAL. PLEASE</p><p>EXPLAIN HOW TO GIVE A CREATIVE OUTLET TO THIS ENERGY.</p><p>The problem is created by the mind, not by the energy. Listen to the
energy. It is showing you the right direction. It is not sexual energy
which is creating the problem -- it has never created any problems in
the animals, in the trees, in the birds. The energy creates problems
because your mind has a wrong attitude about it.</p><p>This question is from an Indian lady. In India the whole upbringing
is against sex. Then you create the problem. And then, whenever there is
energy you will feel sexual because something is incomplete within you.
Something that is unfulfilled will always wait and it will assert
energy, exploit energy.</p><p>In the dynamic methods of meditation much energy is created. Many
hidden sources are tapped and new sources become available. If sex has
remained an unfulfilled desire then this energy will start moving
towards sex. You will become more and more sexual if you meditate.</p><p>Let me tell you one thing that happened in India. Jaina monks
completely stopped meditating because of sexual energy. They forgot all
about meditation because they were repressing sex so much that whenever
they meditated, energy would rise. Meditation gives you tremendous
energy. It is a source of eternal energy, you cannot exhaust it. So
whenever energy arose they would start feeling sexual. They became
afraid of meditations. They dropped them. The most essential thing that
Mahavira had given to them they dropped, and the non- essential --
fasting and keeping rituals -- they continued.</p><p>They fit with an anti-sexual attitude.</p><p>I am not anti-sexual because I am not anti-life. So there is not the
problem where you think it is: the problem is in your head, not in your
sexual glands. You will have to change your attitude otherwise
whatsoever you do will be coloured by your sexuality.</p><p>You meditate and it will become sexual; you look at somebody and your
eyes will become sexual; you touch somebody and your hand will become
sexual; you eat something and eating will become sexual.</p><p>So people who deny sex start eating more. You can watch it in life.
Freely flowing, sexually flowing people will not be very fat, they will
not eat too much. Love is so satisfying, love is so fulfilling, they
will not go on stuffing their body with food. When they can't love, or
when they can't allow themselves to move</p><p>into love, they start eating too much. That becomes a substitute
activity.</p><p>Go and see Hindu monks. They go on gathering unnecessary fat. They
become ugly. That is another extreme. At one extreme are Jaina monks who
cannot eat because they are afraid that once they eat, food will release
energy and the energy will immediately move to the incomplete desire
waiting for it. First it goes to the uncompleted experience which is
hanging in the middle -- that is the first requirement so energy moves
there. The body has a certain economy: wherever energy is needed first,
energy moves there first. There is a hierarchy of needs. A person who
has been denying sex will have a hierarchy -- sex will be first on the
list. And whenever energy is available it will start moving to the most
unfulfilled desire. So Jaina monks cannot eat well, they are afraid, and
Hindu monks eat too much. The problem is the same but they have solved
it in two extreme ways.</p><p>If you eat too much you start getting a certain sexual enjoyment by
eating, by filling your belly too much. Too much food brings lethargy.
And too much food is always a substitute for love because the first
thing the child comes in contact with is the mother's breast. That
breast is the first experience in the world and the breast gives two
things to the child: love and food.</p><p>So love and food become deeply entangled with each other. Whenever
love is missing, your childish mind will think,'Get more food.
Supplement it.' Have you ever watched?</p><p>When you are feeling very full of love your desire to eat disappears,
you don't feel so much appetite. But whenever love is missing, you start
eating too much, you don't know what to do now. Love was filling a
certain space inside you, now that space is empty and you don't know any
other way to fill it than food. You create problems by denying nature,
by rejecting nature.</p><p>So I would like to tell the questioner that it is not a question of
meditation. Lady, you need love. You need a lover. And you need courage
to move into it.</p><p>It is difficult to move into love -- there are very hidden fears in
it. Love creates as much fear as nothing else can because the moment you
start approaching the other you have to go outside yourself. And who
knows? The other may accept you or may reject you. The fear arises. You
start feeling hesitant -- whether to take the move or not, whether to
approach the other or not. Hence all over the</p><p>world the coward ages of the past have decided for marriage instead
of love, because if people were left open to love, very few people would
be able to love. Most would die without love; they would live and drag
out their lives without love.</p><p>Because love is dangerous.… The moment you start moving towards
somebody else you are coming close to colliding with another world. Who
knows if your approach will be accepted or rejected? How can you be
certain the other is going to say yes to your need and to your desire?
That the other is going to be compassionate, loving? How do you know? He
may reject you. He may say no. You may say,'I love you' but what is the
guarantee that he will also feel love for you? He may not. There is no
necessity for it. The fear of rejection is very shattering.</p><p>So cunning and clever people decide not to move at all. Keep to
yourself, then at least you are not rejected. And you can go on
enhancing your ego with the idea that nobody has ever rejected you, even
though that ego is absolutely impotent and is not enough to fulfil you.
You need to be needed; you need somebody to accept you; you need
somebody to love you because only when somebody else loves you, will you
be able to love yourself, not before it. When somebody accepts you, you
will be able to accept yourself, not before it. When somebody else feels
happy with you; you will start feeling happy with yourself, not before
it. The other becomes a mirror.</p><p>Each relationship is a mirror. It reflects you. How can you know
yourself without the mirror? There is no way. Others' eyes become
mirror-like, and when somebody loves you, that mirror is very, very
sympathetic towards you; very, very happy with you; delighted with you.
In those delighted eyes you are reflected and for the first time a
certain acceptability arises.</p><p>Otherwise you have been rejected from the very beginning. It is part
of the ugly structure of society that each child comes to feel that he
is not accepted for himself. If he does something good -- of course,
whatsoever the parents think is good -- if he does that, he is accepted;
if he does something wrong -- what the parents think is wrong -- he is
rejected.</p><p>The child sooner or later starts feeling,'I am not accepted for
myself, not as I am, not intrinsically, but for what I do. Not my being
is loved but my doing.' And that creates a deep self-rejection, a deep
self-hatred. He starts hating himself.</p><p>If you don't fall in love, if you don't find lovers and friends who
can accept you, you will remain with that rejection your whole life.
Love is a must. You must move through it.</p><p>You can come out of it one day, you can transcend it one day -- it
has to be transcended --</p><p>but how can you transcend it if you never enter into it?</p><p>So don't be afraid. And drop all nonsense from the head. Yes, there
is fear. You may be rejected but don't be afraid of that fear. That risk
has to be taken, only then somebody will come and accept you. If you
knock at a hundred doors and ninety-nine remain closed, don't be afraid
-- one will open. Somebody is waiting for you. Somebody will be
fulfilled through you and you will be fulfilled through somebody.
Somebody is waiting to become a mirror for you because somebody is
waiting to make you a mirror for himself.</p><p>And there is no other way to find out who that one is than to go on
knocking, groping. It is risky, but life is risky.</p><p>So very clever people miss life, they never take the risk. Afraid of
falling, they never walk; afraid of drowning, they never swim; afraid of
rejection, they never move in love; afraid of failure, they never make
any effort to succeed in anything</p><p>-- their life is not life at all. They are dead before their death.
They die many times before they really die. Their whole life is nothing
but a gradual death.</p><p>Live, and live intensely, and don't take it as a personal offence if
somebody cannot love you -- there is no necessity. You were ready, you
were available. If the other is not willing, that is for him to decide.
Don't make it a wound, it is not. It simply says that you two don't fit
-- that's all -- it doesn't say anything about you or about the other.
Don't say that the other is wrong and don't think that it is because you
are wrong that you are not accepted. It is just you could not fit.</p><p>And it is good that the other did not deceive you, that he
said,'Sorry, I don't feel any love for you.' At least he was sincere and
authentic. Because if he had said a formal yes, then your whole life
would have been a mess. Be true. When you love, say it, and when you
don't, say that too. Be true and sincere.</p><p>And there are so many beautiful people in the world, why remain with
yourself? Walk a few steps with somebody. Feel that rhythm also. That
rhythm will satisfy</p><p>you and the urge will disappear. And when the urge disappears, your
meditation will be the first in the hierarchy. Meditation can be the
first in the hierarchy only if you have not been denying yourself that
which is natural.</p><p>A person who has been fasting cannot meditate because whenever he
meditates he thinks about food, whenever he closes his eyes he
visualises food. A man who is denying love cannot meditate; whenever he
meditates, immediately sexuality surrounds him.</p><p>Fulfil all natural needs, nothing is wrong in them. What is wrong in
food, in sex? Nothing is wrong. Fulfil them. Be so natural that when you
meditate there is no other thing waiting for your attention. If you
fulfil your natural needs you will see that your dreams will disappear.
In the night you will not dream because there is nothing to dream
about.</p><p>Fast, then you will dream about food; force celibacy on yourself,
then you will dream about sex. If you are moving naturally, if you have
found a tune between you and nature That's what I call DHARMA, that's
what I call the ultimate law</p><p>of life. Find yourself almost always in rhythm. Sometimes even if you
go out of step come back again; remember and fall into line again.
Remain with nature and you will reach to the goal; remain with nature
and you will find God. You can even forget about God, then too you will
find him -- if you remain true to nature. Because when lower needs are
fulfilled, higher needs arise; when higher needs are fulfilled, ultimate
needs arise. This is the natural economy of life.</p><p>If a person is hungry, how can he understand music? It is sheer
absurdity to ask him to listen to classical music when he is hungry. Or
to tell him to meditate or to sit in zazen.</p><p>He cannot think anything about Buddha, cannot think anything about
God or Jesus. He cannot meditate, his mind will flicker and waver; it
will go again and again to his empty stomach. No, he cannot love poetry
and he cannot love music when the first needs are unfulfilled. Give him
fulfillment in the first, primary needs -- food, shelter, love -- and
then suddenly the energy is released from the lower world and he will
start reading poetry, listening to music; he will enjoy dancing. Now
higher needs are arising: he would like to paint or sculpt. These are
luxuries. They only come into existence when lower needs are fulfilled.
And when these higher needs are also fulfilled -- you have loved music,
listened to music; you have loved poetry, enjoyed it; you have painted,
danced --</p><p>one day you will see a new realm of needs is arising called the
ultimate needs: meditation, God, prayer.</p><p>If the first needs are not fulfilled, the second will not arise --
and the third is out of the question. If the first needs are fulfilled
then there is the possibility for the second needs to arise and a
glimpse of the third to happen also. When the second is fulfilled, the
third arises automatically on its own accord.</p><p>Just the other day in kundalini meditation two dogs were watching.
After a while one dog looked at the other and said,'When I act like that
they give me worm pills.'</p><p>Of course, a dog has a dog's mind. He has his own world, terminology,
understanding, concepts. He can only think that people who are doing
kundalini either have worms in their stomach or have gone crazy. And
that is natural to a dog's understanding.</p><p>Your mind has been conditioned for centuries by people who have not
understood your real needs. They have not bothered at all. They were
looking for something else and they have managed that very well... they
were looking for how to dominate people. And the easiest way is to
create a guilty conscience -- then it is very easy to dominate
people.</p><p>Once the guilt exists you will be dominated by one or the other, by
this or that, but you will be dominated. A guilty person never feels at
ease with himself, he cannot have any confidence; he knows that he is
wrong so he goes and finds a leader, he goes and finds some church, he
goes and finds somebody to guide him. He is unconfident, hence the need
arises. Politicians, priests, have worked very hard to create a guilty
conscience in everybody. Now that guilty conscience is creating
trouble.</p><p>Drop it. Life is yours. It belongs to nobody else. No politician, no
priest has anything to do with it. Don't allow anybody to meddle with
your life. It is totally yours.</p><p>And your body is giving you the right indication; the body is very
wise. The mind is a very late arrival. The body has lived millions of
years, it knows what is needed. It is the mind that interferes. Mind is
very immature, body is very mature. Listen to the body.</p><p>And when I say listen to the body, I don't mean remain confined to
the body. If you listen to the body, the body will not have anything to
say to you -- things will be settled. And when the body is at ease,
relaxed, and there is no tension, and the body is not fighting for
something, is not trying to attract your attention because you are not
fulfilling a need, when the body is calm and quiet, you can float high,
you can fly high, you can become a white cloud. But only when body needs
are truly looked after. The body is not your enemy, it is your friend.
The body is your earth, the body has all your roots. You have to find a
bridge between you and your body. If you don't find that bridge, you
will be constantly in conflict with your body -- and a person who is
fighting with himself is always miserable.</p><p>The first thing is to come to a peace-pact with your body and never
break it. Once you have come to a peace-pact with your body, the body
will become very, very friendly. You look after the body, the body will
look after you -- it becomes a vehicle of tremendous value, it becomes
the very temple. One day your body itself is revealed to you as the very
shrine of God.</p><p>The second question:</p><p>Question 2</p><p>FOR THE LAST TEN DAYS I HAVE FELT TREMENDOUSLY HAPPY -- AS I NEVER
DID BEFORE. JUST BEING MYSELF AND ACCEPTING ME AS I AM</p><p>FEELS GREAT. SOMETIMES THIS INCREDIBLY GOOD FEELING IS</p><p>DISTURBED BY TWO THOUGHTS. FIRST, WILL THIS STAY THAT WAY? CAN I KEEP
THIS FEELING IN THE FUTURE? AND SECOND, WHY DID I HAVE TO</p><p>BECOME SO OLD BEFORE I REACHED THIS POINT? I CANNOT FORGET AND</p><p>STILL I FEEL SORRY FOR ALL THOSE YEARS THAT I DID NOT LIVE AT
ALL.</p><p>PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW TO GET RID OF THESE DISTURBANCES OF MY</p><p>HAPPINESS.</p><p>This has been asked by Swami Prem Dhyan. When he came just six months
before, he was one of the most miserable persons I have ever come
across. And it has been a miracle! He has changed totally! Now I can say
just the opposite,'He is one of the most happy persons around here.'</p><p>These two questions are natural because now he is going to leave, he
will be going back home. The fear arises. Will he be able to keep this
happiness that has happened to him?</p><p>The future.… And the second question: he feels sorry for all those
years that he lived but did not really live, that he missed. He could
have lived those years as happy as he is now.</p><p>The past.…</p><p>These are the two dangers to be alert about. Whenever you become
tremendously happy immediately mind starts spinning its web. And two are
the methods of the mind, because mind exists either with the past or
with the future. It immediately says,'Look, you could have been so happy
your whole life.' Now the mind is distracting you. Say to the mind,'What
does it matter? Those twenty years, or thirty years, or fifty years, are
gone.</p><p>Whether I lived them happily or unhappily, they are gone -- it makes
no difference.' In the morning, when you awake, what difference does it
make that you dreamed a very sweet dream or that it was a nightmare?
What difference does it make? When you awake in the morning both were
dreams. And the night is over and you are no more asleep.</p><p>When the mind says, 'Look, you could have been this happy always,'
the mind is creating an absurd desire. You cannot go back, you cannot do
anything about the past, the past is gone and gone forever, irreversibly
gone. Just think, even if you had been happy all those fifteen years,
what difference does it make now? Whether happy or unhappy, it is just a
memory. In fact, whether your past existed or not, what difference does
it make now?</p><p>Bertrand Russell has written somewhere that sometimes he starts
brooding about whether the past really existed or whether he simply
imagines that it existed; were you a child really or did you simply
dream about being a child? How can</p><p>you differentiate now?</p><p>Both are in the memory -- whether you dreamed about it or whether you
lived it, both are part of memory and there is no way to differentiate.
The past is in the memory -- real, unreal, both.</p><p>And psychologists say that when people say something about their
past, don't trust them, because in their past many imaginations and
dreams have mingled and mixed. Their past is not factual. And there is
no way now because everything is contained only in the memory. Whether
you were really living it or you had just dreamed it, both have mixed
and melted into each other.</p><p>Past is just memory but the mind can create great trouble, and by
creating that fuss it will deprive you of the happiness that is
available right now. You just say to the mind,'I am finished with the
past and I don't care a bit whether it was happy or unhappy, it is gone
and gone forever. Now is the only moment.'</p><p>If you don't listen to this trap then the mind has another trap for
you. It will say,'Okay, the past is gone but the future -- what about
the future? At least you can manage the future. It has yet to happen.
You can plan for it. And this beautiful space in which you are now,
won't you like it to be there forever and ever?' Again the desire will
arise. Don't say yes to it because again it will lead you away from the
present.</p><p>And happiness is always herenow. Happiness is something that belongs
to the present.</p><p>Now say to the mind,'I am not worried about the future at all because
if I can be happy now, this moment, I can be happy forever because the
future never comes as future, it always comes as the present. And now I
know the secret of being happy in the present so why bother about the
future? Tomorrow will not come as tomorrow, it will come as today. And I
have the key to open the door. At least this moment I am happy and I
know how to be happy in this moment. All moments that will come will
come always like this moment.'</p><p>Have you watched? There is no difference between one moment and
another moment.</p><p>Time is completely beyond discrimination. It is always pure now.</p><p>So beware. These are the two traps of the mind. Mind cannot live
without misery so mind is trying to create misery so it can disturb your
peace. Then it will be perfectly happy.</p><p>Once you start feeling sorry for your past -- it does not matter for
what you feel sorry -- if you feel sorry, you start getting sad,
depressed. And once you start getting too concerned about the future,
you become full of desire, tense -- worried whether you will be able to
manage or not, whether you will be able to perform or not.</p><p>Between these two rocks the fragile moment of the present is crushed.
So you have to be very alert. When one is unhappy one can remain without
alertness -- one has nothing to lose. When one is happy, one has to be
very careful and cautious -- now one has a treasure to lose. And it can
be lost within a second, within a split second. One step wrong and it
can be lost. And these are the two directions in which you can lose your
treasure.</p><p>A person who is poor, a beggar, need not be worried that he can be
robbed. But a person who has treasures has to be very cautious. When
Buddha walked so cautiously, why was he walking so cautiously? He had
something, something tremendously fragile which could be dropped in any
moment of unawareness and be lost.</p><p>There is a Zen story. A king in Japan used to visit his capital every
night. He became aware that a beggar was always sitting alert under his
tree; he never found him asleep.</p><p>The king went at different times but he was alert the whole night,
just sitting there, completely immobile, with his eyes open.</p><p>Out of curiosity he asked the beggar,'What are you being so cautious
for? For what are you guarding? I can't see that you have anything that
could be stolen or that anybody could cheat you. Why do you go on
sitting like that and watching?'</p><p>The beggar laughed and he said,'Sir, as far as I am concerned I would
like to ask you the same question. Why so many guards? Why so much army
around the palace? I don't see that you have anything to be guarded. I
have never seen a bigger beggar than you. You are completely empty, I
can see through and through you. I don't see any treasure there.</p><p>What are you creating so much fuss about? As far as I am concerned, I
have a treasure and I have to be alert about it. A single moment of
unconsciousness and it can be lost.'</p><p>And the beggar said,'Look into my eyes, because my treasure is hidden
within me.'</p><p>And it is said that the king looked into the eyes of the beggar,
entered into his eyes and was completely lost. It was a tremendously
luminous space. He became a disciple to this beggar.</p><p>This beggar was a Zen Master and the king had been in search for many
years and he had been to many Masters but he could never feel the vibe
of the' unknown. With this beggar he could feel it almost crystallised
in front of his eyes, he could touch it. Something Divine had happened
to this man.</p><p>So when you have a little treasure to guard, guard it. Now these two
will be the thieves --</p><p>the past and the future. You be alert. Nothing else is needed, just
alertness. Just shake yourself out of sleep. Whenever you start falling
into the trap, give yourself a jerk and remember.</p><p>I would like to tell you one of the most beautiful parables that has
been written down the centuries. Parables have almost disappeared from
the world because those beautiful people -- Jesus, Buddha, who created
many parables -- have disappeared.</p><p>A parable is not an ordinary story, a parable is a device -- a device
to say something which cannot ordinarily be said, a device to hint at
something which can be hinted at only very indirectly.</p><p>This parable is written in this age; a very rare man, Franz Kafka,
has written it. He was really a rare man. He struggled hard not to write
because, he said, what he wanted to write could not be written. So he
struggled hard but he could not control the temptation to write, so he
wrote.</p><p>And he wrote in one of his diaries,'I am writing because it is
difficult not to write, and knowing well that it is difficult also to
write. Seeing no way out of it, I am writing.' And when he died, he left
a will in the name of one of his friends to</p><p>say,'Please burn everything that I have written -- my diaries, my
stories, my parables, my sketches, my notes. And burn them without
reading them. Because this is the only way that I can get rid of that
constant anxiety that I have been trying to say something which cannot
be said.</p><p>And I could not resist so I have written. Now this is the only way. I
have written it because I could not control myself. I had to write
knowing well that it could not be written, so now, without reading it,
destroy, burn everything utterly. Nothing should be left.'</p><p>But the friend could not do it. And it is good that he did not.</p><p>This is one of Kafka's parables. Listen to it, meditate over it. I
gave order for my horse to be brought from the stable. The servant did
not understand me. I myself went to the stable, saddled my horse and
mounted. In the distance I heard a bugle call. I asked him what this
meant. He knew nothing and had heard nothing.</p><p>At the gate he stopped me, asking,'Where are you riding to,
Master?'</p><p>'I don't know,' I said, 'only away from here. Away from here, always
away from here.</p><p>Only by doing so can I reach my destination.' 'And so you know your
destination?' he asked.</p><p>'Yes,' I answered. 'Did not I say so? Away from here -- that's my
destination.' 'You have no provisions with you, ' he said.</p><p>'I need none,' I said. 'The journey is so long that I must die of
hunger if I don't get anything along the way. No provisions can save me
because the journey is so long, I cannot carry enough provisions for it.
No provisions can save me because it is, fortunately, a truly immense
journey.'</p><p>Now this is the parable. 'The destination,' he says, 'is away from
here. Away from here is my destination.' That's how the whole world is
moving: away from here, away from now.</p><p>You don't know where you are going but one thing is certain -- you
are going</p><p>away from here, away from now.</p><p>The parable says it is an immense journey. It is really endless
because you can never reach away from here. How can you reach 'away from
here'? Wherever you will reach, it will be here. And again you will be
trying to go away from here. There is no way to reach this destination.
If away from here is the destiny then there is no way to reach it. And
we are all escaping away from here.</p><p>Watch. Don't allow this parable to become your life. Ordinarily
everybody is doing this --</p><p>knowingly, unknowingly. Start moving into the here, start moving into
the now. And then there is tremendous happiness -- so much so that it
starts overflowing from you. Not only YOU delight in it, it starts
overflowing, it starts becoming your climate, it becomes like a cloud
around you. So whoever comes close to you becomes full of it. Even
others will start partaking of it, participating in it.</p><p>And the more you have, the more you will be drowning into the
herenow. Then a moment comes when you don't have any space left for
yourself -- only happiness exists; you disappear.</p><p>But of two things -- the past and the future -- be alert.</p><p>And now, Prem Dhyan, you have something to lose -- you are fortunate
because you have something to lose. And you have a tremendous
responsibility not to lose it. The mind will go on trying its ways for a
time being. When you become so alert that the mind cannot penetrate you
and cannot disturb and distract you, then by and by the mind starts
dropping. Then one day it understands well that now there is no way with
you -- so it leaves you. Then it stops haunting you.</p><p>That day will also come. As you could not believe before that this
happiness was possible, you may not be able to believe what I am saying
now. The day will also come when there will be no distraction.</p><p>Then again you will have to be even more alert because you will start
crying,'Why did I waste so many years with this distraction?' And then
you will become again concerned with the future. Many times you will
come to face this past and future in many, many different ways. It is
like a person going to the peak of a hill -- he moves round and round
the hill, the path moves round and round, and many times you come to the
same view, to the same place. A little</p><p>higher, but the same place -- the same trees, the same sky. Again and
again, many times before you reach to the peak, you come to the same
point -- a little higher of course, but the same point, again and again.
Many times you will come again and again to this same distraction of
past and future. This is just the beginning.</p><p>But one day one reaches the peak and when one reaches the peak, all
becomes available simultaneously: the valley, the sky, the clouds, the
height, the depth -- everything becomes available. That's what
enlightenment is.</p><p>The third question:</p><p>Question 3</p><p>THE OTHER DAY I TOOK A PIECE OF PAPER AND DID A LITTLE DOODLING</p><p>OR FREE WRITING, AND I WAS PAINED TO FIND THAT I WAS FULL OF
SELF-CONDEMNATION AND SELF-PITY. I HAD NOT A NICE WORD FOR ME IN</p><p>THAT LONG NOTE. IS IT THAT I AM TOO IDEALISTIC AND SELF- CENTRED</p><p>AND IS THERE A WAY OUT OF THIS DARKNESS?</p><p>Everybody is brought up in such a way that everybody has become
idealistic. Nobody is realistic. The ideal is the common disease of
humanity.</p><p>Everybody is brought up in such a way that everybody goes on thinking
that they have to be something, somebody, somewhere in the future. An
image is given and you have to be like it. That gives you a tension
because you are not it, you are something else, yet you have to be
it.</p><p>So one goes on condemning the real for the unreal -- the unreal is
unreal. And the ideal goes on pulling you towards the future, out of the
present.</p><p>The ideal becomes a constant nightmare because it goes on condemning.
Whatsoever you do is imperfect because you have an ideal of perfection.
Whatsoever you attain is still not fulfilling because you have a mad
expectation</p><p>which can never be satisfied.</p><p>You are human, in a certain time, in a certain space, with certain
limitations. Accept those limitations. Perfectionists are always on the
brink of madness. They are obsessed people -- whatsoever they do is not
good enough. And there is no way to do something perfectly -- perfection
is not humanly possible. In fact, imperfect is the only way to be.</p><p>So what do I teach you here? I don't teach you perfection, I teach
you wholeness. That is a totally different thing. Be whole. Don't bother
about perfection. When I say be whole, I mean be real, be here;
whatsoever you do, do it totally. You will be imperfect but your
imperfection will be full of beauty, it will be full of your
totality.</p><p>Never try to be perfect otherwise you will create much anxiety. So
many troubles are there already; don't create more troubles for
yourself.</p><p>I have heard.</p><p>It happened that bedraggled, worried Garfinkel sat in a train holding
a three- year-old boy.</p><p>Every few minutes Garfinkel spanked the child.</p><p>'If you strike that baby one more time,' said a woman sitting across
from him, 'I'll give you so much trouble you won't forget it!'</p><p>'Trouble?' said Garfinkel. 'You're gonna give me trouble? Lady, my
partner stole all my money and ran off with my wife and car. My daughter
is in the parlor car, six months pregnant, and she ain't got no husband.
My baggage is lost, I'm on the wrong train, and this little stinker just
ate the tickets and threw up all over me. And lady, YOU'RE gonna give me
trouble?'</p><p>Now what more trouble can there be? Don't you think enough is
enough?</p><p>Life itself is so complicated, please be a little more kinder towards
yourself. Don't create ideals. Life is creating enough problems but
those problems can be solved. If you are in a wrong train you can change
the train; if the tickets are lost, they can be purchased again; if your
wife has run away, you can find another woman. The problems that life
gives to you can be solved but the</p><p>problems that idealism gives to you can never be solved -- they are
impossible.</p><p>Somebody is trying to become Jesus.… Now there is no way; it does not
happen that way, nature does not allow it. Jesus happens only once, and
only once; nature does not tolerate any repetition. Somebody is trying
to become a Buddha -</p><p>- now he is trying to do the impossible. It simply does not happen,
cannot happen; it is against nature. You can be only yourself. So be
total. Wherever you are and whatsoever you are doing, do it totally.</p><p>Move into it, let it become your meditation. Don't be worried whether
it will be perfect or not -- it is not going to be perfect. If it is
total it is enough. If it was total you enjoyed doing it, you felt a
fulfillment through it, you moved into it, you were absorbed into it,
you came out of it new, fresh, young, rejuvenated.</p><p>Each act that is done totally rejuvenates, and each act that is done
totally never brings any bondage. Love totally and attachment does not
arise; love partially and attachment arises.</p><p>Live totally and you are not afraid of death; live partially and you
are afraid of death.</p><p>But forget the word 'perfection'. It is one of the most criminal
words. This word should be dropped from all the languages of the world,
it should be dropped from the human mind.</p><p>Nobody has ever been perfect and nobody can ever be. Can't you see
it? Even if God is there and you come to meet him, can't you find faults
with his creation? So many, that's why he is hiding. He is almost afraid
of you. Faults and faults and faults. Can you count them? Infinite
faults you will find. In fact, if you are a fault-finder you cannot find
anything right -- in the right time, in the right place. Everything
seems to be just a mess.</p><p>Even God is not perfect; God is total. He enjoyed doing it, he is
still enjoying doing it.</p><p>But he is not perfect. If he were perfect then the creation could not
be imperfect. Out of perfection, perfection will come.</p><p>All the religions of the world say that God is perfect. I don't say
so. I say God is whole, God is holy, God is total -- but not perfect.
Although he may still be</p><p>trying.… How can he be perfect? If he were, the world would be dead
by now. Once something is perfect, death happens because there is no
future, there is no way. Trees are still growing, babies are still born
-- things continue. And he goes on improving. Can't you see the
improvement?</p><p>He goes on improving on everything. That's the meaning of evolution:
things are being improved. Monkeys have become man -- that's an
improvement. Then man will become Divine and God -- that is
evolution.</p><p>Teilhard de Chardin says there is an omega point where everything
will become perfect.</p><p>There is none. There is no omega point. There cannot be. The world is
always in the process; evolution is there; we are approaching and
approaching but we never reach because once we reach -- finished. God
still goes on trying in different ways, improving.</p><p>One thing is certain: he is happy with his work otherwise he would
have abandoned it. He is still pouring his energy into it. When God is
happy with you it is sheer nonsense to be unhappy with yourself. Be
happy with yourself. Let happiness be the ultimate value. I am a
hedonist. Always remember that happiness is the criterion. Whatsoever
you do, be happy, that's all. Don't be bothered whether it is perfect or
not.</p><p>Why this obsession with perfection? Then you will be tense, anxious,
nervous, always uneasy, troubled, in conflict. The English word 'agony'
comes from a root which means: to be in conflict. To be constantly
wrestling with oneself -- that is the meaning of agony.</p><p>You will be in agony if you are not at ease with yourself. Don't
demand the impossible, be natural, at ease, loving yourself, loving
others.</p><p>And remember, a person who cannot love himself because he goes on
condemning, cannot love anybody else either. A perfectionist is not only
a perfectionist about himself, he is about others also. A man who is
hard on himself is bound to be hard on others. His demands are
impossible.</p><p>In India just a few years before, there was Mahatma Gandhi, a
perfectionist, almost a neurotic. And he was very hard with his
disciples -- even tea was not allowed. Teal Because it has nicotine. If
somebody was found drinking tea in his</p><p>ashram it was a great sin. Love was not allowed. If somebody fell in
love with somebody it was such a great sin that it was as if the whole
world was going to be drowned because of it. He was continuously spying
on his disciples, always sitting at the keyhole. But he was that way
with himself. You can be with others only as you are with yourself.</p><p>But these types of people become great leaders because they create
much guilt in others.</p><p>The more guilt you can create in people, the greater the leader you
can become. Because more and more people feel that yes, you can help
them to become perfect. They are imperfect so you can help them to
become perfect.</p><p>I am not here to help you to become perfect; I am not concerned with
any sort of nonsense. I am just here to help you to be yourself. If you
are imperfect, beautiful; if you are perfect, that too is beautiful.</p><p>Don't try to become imperfect because that can become an ideal! You
may be perfect already -- then listening to me can create a trouble for
yourself! This man says be imperfect! There is no need. If you are
perfect accept that too!</p><p>Try to love yourself. Don't condemn. Once humanity starts a deep
acceptance, all churches will disappear and all politicians and priests
will disappear.</p><p>I have heard.</p><p>A man was fishing in the North Woods and one night around the
campfire his guide was telling him of the time he had guided Harry
Emerson Fosdick on a fishing trip.</p><p>'Yes,' said the guide, 'he was a good man except for his
swearing.'</p><p>'But look,' said the fisherman, 'surely you don't mean to say that
Dr. Fosdick was profane?'</p><p>'Oh, but he was, sir,' protested the guide. 'Once he caught a fine
bass. Just as he was about to land him in the boat, the fish wiggled off
the hook. So I say to the Doctor, "That's a damned shame!" and the Doc
comes right back and says, "Yes, it is!" But that's the only time I ever
heard him use such language.'</p><p>Now this is the mind of a perfectionist. The Doctor has not said
anything. He simply says,'Yes, it is.' But that too is enough for a
perfectionist to find fault with.</p><p>A perfectionist is neurotic. And not only is he neurotic, he creates
neurotic trends around him. So don't be a perfectionist, and if somebody
is a perfectionist around you escape away from him as fast as you can
before he pollutes your mind.</p><p>All perfectionism is a sort of deep ego trip. Just to think of
yourself in terms of ideals and perfection is nothing but to decorate
your ego to its uttermost. A humble person accepts that life is not
perfect. A humble person, a really religious person, accepts that we are
limited, that there are limitations.</p><p>Look... that is my definition of humbleness. Not to try to be perfect
is to be humble.</p><p>And a humble person becomes more and more total because he has
nothing to deny, nothing to reject. He accepts whatsoever he is, good,
bad. And a humble person is very rich because he accepts his wholeness;
his anger, his sex, his greed -- everything is accepted. In that deep
acceptance a great alchemical change happens. All that is ugly by and by
disappears on its own accord. He becomes more and more harmonious, more
and more whole.</p><p>I am not in favour of a saint but I am in favour of a holy man. A
saint is a perfectionist; a holy man is totally different. Zen Masters
are holy men; Catholic saints are saints. The very word 'saint' is ugly.
It comes from 'sanctos' -- one who has been given sanction by the
authority that he is a saint. Now who can authorise anybody to be a
saint? Is it a sort of degree? But the Christian Church goes on doing
that foolish thing.</p><p>Even posthumous degrees are awarded. A saint may have died three
hundred years before, then the Church revises its ideas, or the world
has changed, and after three hundred years the Church gives a posthumous
degree -- a sanction that that man was really a saint, we could not
understand him at the time. And the church may have killed that man --
that's how Joan of Arc became a saint. They killed her, but later on
they changed their idea. People by and by came closer and closer to Joan
of Arc and it became difficult not to accept her. First they killed her,
then they worshipped her. After hundreds of years, her bones</p><p>were found and worshipped. She was burned by the same people, the
same Church.</p><p>No, the word 'saint' is not good. A holy man is a holy man because of
himself, not because some church decides to award him sainthood.</p><p>I have heard.</p><p>Jacobson, aged ninety, had lived through beatings in Polish pogroms,
concentration camps in Germany, and dozens of other anti-Semitic
experiences.</p><p>'Oh, Lord!' he prayed, sitting in a synagogue. 'Isn't it true that we
are your chosen people?'</p><p>And from the heavens boomed a voice:'Yes, Jacobson, the Jews are my
chosen people!'</p><p>'Well, then,' wailed the old man,'isn't it time you chose somebody
else?'</p><p>Perfectionists are the chosen people of God, remember. In fact, the
day you understand that you are creating your own misery because of your
ideas, you break all ideas. Then you simply live out of your reality --
whatsoever it is. That is a great transformation.</p><p>So don't try to be chosen people of God, just be human. For God's
sake, just be human!</p><p>The fourth question:</p><p>Question 4</p><p>THE OTHER DAY YOU SAID THAT EFFORT IS DANGEROUS, BUT HARD</p><p>WORK IS NEEDED IN THE MEDITATIONS. FOR MY GERMAN MIND, EFFORT</p><p>EQUALS HARD WORK. IS THERE HARD WORK WITHOUT EFFORT?</p><p>The point is delicate. Effort is always half-hearted, effort is
always partial. You</p><p>are doing it because you don't see any way you can attain to the
result you desire without doing it.</p><p>If there was any way you would drop the effort and jump to the
conclusion. One is never totally in his effort, cannot be, because the
idea is of the future, the end result. Effort is future-oriented,
result-oriented. One is doing it only for the sake of some future
result, some profit, some greed, some good pay-off.</p><p>That's why Zen Masters say effortless effort is needed. What do they
mean by effortless effort? They say hard work is needed but it should
not be future- oriented. You should enjoy it. Not for some other goal --
even if nothing is attained through it, it is beautiful in itself. And
that is the hardest thing for the human mind to do. That's why I call it
hard work. The hardest thing is to do something for its own sake, to
sing a song for its own sake, to meditate for its own sake, to love for
its own sake. That is the hardest thing for the human mind because mind
is future-oriented. It says,'For its own sake? Then why?</p><p>What is going to happen out of it?'</p><p>People come to me and they ask,'We can meditate but what will we
attain? We can become sannyasins but what are we going to gain out of
it?' This is what mind is --</p><p>always greedy. Let me tell you.…</p><p>One day Mulla Nasruddin was watching the street through the window
when he saw his creditor approaching the house. Knowing what the fellow
was up to, Mulla called his wife and told her to handle the visitor.</p><p>Accordingly, the wife opened the door and said,'Yes, sir, I know we
haven't yet been able to pay you. And although Mulla himself is not home
at this moment, he thinks day and night about ways to get some money and
pay you back. He has even asked me to watch the street and whenever a
flock of sheep passes to go out and pick up any pieces of wool that
might have been caught on the bushes. This way, when we get enough wool,
we can spin it, make a couple of shawls, sell them and with the money
pay you back.'</p><p>When she got to this point, the man started to laugh, whereupon Mulla
came out</p><p>of his hiding and said,'You rascal, now that you smell money, you
start to grin.'</p><p>The mind is that rascal. Once it gets any hint of any sort of future
it starts to grin. It immediately jumps on it, catches hold of it -- you
are no longer herenow. Meditation is for its own sake as love is for its
own sake.</p><p>Ask a rose why he flowers. He simply flowers. It is so beautiful to
flower. There is no motive in it. Ask the birds why they are singing.
They are simply singing. They enjoy, they delight in it, there is no
motive in it.</p><p>Drop the mind and motive disappears. So at least for a few hours in a
day go on doing things for their own sake: dance, sing, play on the
guitar, sit with friends, or just watch the sky. At least for a few
hours go on devoting your time to intrinsic activities. These activities
are the hard work. And I know, mind is very lazy. It likes to dream, it
doesn't want to work, that's why it continuously thinks of the future.
But mind is very lazy. It only thinks of the future so that the present
can be avoided and the challenge of the present can be avoided.</p><p>I have heard an anecdote.</p><p>While walking along a creek bank a man came across a young fellow
lying lazily under a tree with a fishing line in the water, on which the
cork was bobbling frantically.</p><p>'Hey, you've got a bite!' he said.</p><p>'Yeah.' drawled the fisherman. 'Would you mind pulling it out?'</p><p>The walker did so, only to have the recumbent one ask,'Would, you
mind taking the fish off, rebaiting the hook, and tossing it back in the
creek?'</p><p>This was done and the man commented jokingly,'As lazy as you are, you
ought to have some kids to do these things for you.'</p><p>'Not a bad idea,' yawned the fisherman. 'Got any idea where I could
find a pregnant woman?'</p><p>That's how the mind is; it does not want to do anything. It simply
hopes, desires, postpones. The future is a trick to postpone the
present; the future is a trick to avoid the present. Not that you are
going to do anything in the future, no --</p><p>because again the same mind will be there and it will say tomorrow,
tomorrow. You will die and you will not do anything, you will only
think. And that thinking helps you to keep face: you don't feel lazy
because you think so much of doing, doing great things always, dreaming
about great things and not doing the small things that are really to be
done right now.</p><p>Hard work means to be present and to do that which the present has
brought you as a challenge.</p><p>THE OTHER DAY YOU SAID THAT EFFORT IS DANGEROUS BUT HARD</p><p>WORK WAS NEEDED IN THE MEDITATIONS. Yes, hard work -- because you
will have to go against the mind. The hardness is not in the work -- the
work is beautifully simple, the work is very easy -- the hardness comes
from the fact that because you are so fogged by the mind you will have
to come out of it.</p><p>FOR MY GERMAN MIND, EFFORT EQUALS HARD WORK. That I</p><p>understand --</p><p>but all minds are German. That's why everybody is in such trouble,
that's why everybody finds his own fascism, his own nazism, his own
Adolf Hitler. Everybody does. Mind is fascist and mind looks
continuously for leaders, for somebody to lead. It was a surprise to the
whole world when Germany fell into the trap of Adolf Hitler.</p><p>Nobody could believe it, it was almost illogical. Such a beautiful
race with such a great tradition of learning, of learned men, of great
philosophy, of Kant, Hegel, Feuerbach, Marx.… Such a great culture with
such refined intellect; a culture of great scientists, of great
musicians, of great novelists and poets; the country of the philosophers
and professors.…'Professor' has never been such a respectable word in
any other country as in Germany. What happened to such an intelligent
race that it fell into the hands of a stupid, almost idiot person, Adolf
Hitler?</p><p>But this has to be understood: that all learning, if it is
superficial, if it is of the mind, is not going to help. The learning
only remains at the surface -- deep down you remain childish. Those
professors, even a man like Martin Heidegger -- a great philosopher, you
could say the greatest that this century has produced -- he also became
a follower of Adolf Hitler. What happened to these giants following this
man who was almost mad?</p><p>It has to be understood; it can happen, it has always happened. These
great minds are just great on the surface, deep down their existence is
very childish; only their intellect has grown, they have not grown.</p><p>Martin Heidegger's mind is very grown-up,.his being is very childish.
His being is childish; it is waiting for somebody to lead it. A really
mature person does not throw his responsibility on to anybody else; he
becomes responsible for his own being.</p><p>Now this whole country of scientists, philosophers, professors,
poets, giant intellectuals, fell victim to a very ordinary, mediocre
man. And that man ruled over it.</p><p>This must help everybody to understand the foolishness of intellect.
Intellect is superficial. One should grow in being otherwise one is
always prone, one always tends to become a victim of such people. They
always happen.</p><p>Mind is conditioned from the outside; it can be ruled from the
outside. You have to grow into no-mind, only then can you not be ruled
from the outside. Only a man of no-mind is a free man, independent. He
is neither German, nor Indian, nor English, nor American --</p><p>he is simply free. American, Indian, German...these are the names of
your prisons, these are not your freedom skies. These are not skies to
fly in, these are the prisons to live in.</p><p>A free man belongs to himself and nobody else. A free man is simply
an energy with no name, no form, no race, no nation. The days of nations
and races are past, the days of the individual are coming. In a better
world there will be no Germans, no Indians, no Hindus, no Christians --
there will be pure individuals, perfectly free, living their life in
their own way, not disturbing anybody's life and not allowing anybody to
disturb their lives.</p><p>Otherwise, mind is childish and yet cunning. It can fall victim to
any Adolf Hitler, to any chauvinist, to any mad person who is bold
enough...and people are bold, they never hesitate. That was the appeal
of Adolf Hitler. He was so bold that he was absolutely bold.</p><p>He would never hesitate, he was absolutely certain. And people who
are uncertain in their being immediately find a deep appeal in such a
person. This is</p><p>a man who is so certain about truth that he must have attained to
truth. They start falling in line with him.</p><p>Because of your uncertainty you become a victim to somebody who is
mad. But mad people are always certain, only very, very alert and aware
people hesitate. Their hesitation shows their awareness and the
complexity of life.</p><p>And mind is very cunning. It can rationalise everything. I have
heard.</p><p>Berger, hiding with his wife from the Nazis in a secluded Berlin
attic, decided to get a breath of fresh air. While out walking he came
face to face with Adolf Hitler.</p><p>The German leader pulled out a gun and pointed to a pile of horse
manure in the street.</p><p>'All right,.Jew!' he shouted. 'Eat that or I'll kill you!' Trembling,
Berger did as he was ordered.</p><p>Hitler began laughing so hard he dropped the weapon. Berger picked it
up and said,'Now, you eat the manure or I'll shoot!' The Fuhrer got down
on his hands and knees and began eating.</p><p>While he was occupied, Berger sneaked away, ran through an alley,
climbed over a fence, and dashed up the stairs to the attic. He slammed
the door shut, bolted and locked it securely. 'Hilda! Hilda!' he
exclaimed to his wife. 'Guess who I had lunch with today!'</p><p>Mind goes on rationalising. Even if you eat horse manure it can make
it a lunch -</p><p>- and</p><p>'Hilda, Hilda, guess who I had lunch with today'! Beware of the traps
of the mind. And the more you become alert, the more you will be able to
live in the moment, in the act, totally. Then there is no motivation:
you do it because you delight in it.</p><p>And that's why I call it the hardest work. To get out of the mind is
the hardest work. But it is not effort, it is awareness; it is not
effort, it is intense alertness.</p><p>The last question:</p><p>Question 5</p><p>FOR ENLIGHTENMENT DOES ONE NEED A HUMAN BODY? CAN'T A DOG OR</p><p>A TREE WHICH IS FLOWERING GET ENLIGHTENED?</p><p>Dang, dang, doko dang, doko dang.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;text-indent:0;text-align:center id=table-of-contents>Table of Contents</h1><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_great_pilgrimage_from_here_to_here/part7/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Chapter title: Cowards cannot enter here</span>

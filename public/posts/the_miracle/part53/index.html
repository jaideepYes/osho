EVEN THIS TALK IS BUT A DECORATION ON THE\nDOOR OF OUR HOUSE. THE IMPORTANT THING IS YOUR EXPERIENTIAL\nREALIZATION OF THIS STATE.\nManeesha, before I discuss the great matter of Zen, Avirbhava has brought a few ancient gods to be inaugurated into her Museum of Gods. Her assistant, Anando, has also brought a few small gods. Before I tell them to show you what they have brought ...\nThe research on the subject of the rat as an object of worship ... The rat is a very ancient god, but still prevalent, not dead. The research was done by the appropriate person, Sardar Gurudayal Singh.\n\"The rat is the charioteer of the elephant god, Ganesh. According to myth it is worshipped all over India, and especially in Maharashtra.\nRats are said to consume more grain than all the people of India. They are one of the causes of India's poverty, and their growth rate is far greater than that of the Indian people.\nDuring Indira Gandhi's rule there were suggestions brought to parliament about how to tackle this problem. Immediately, opposition leaders from Morarji Desai's party argued that a poisoning of rats was out of the question because that would hurt the religious feelings of Osho - The Miracle\n102\nChapter 8 - Joy in the morning\nMaharashtran people. The only solution to this menace of rats destroying the grainstocks that was considered was to make the rats aware of birth control. But how to get this message to the rats? The opposition claimed that they had done their duty by suggesting this great solution; the implementing of birth control upon the rats would be the ruling party's affair. That was the end of the debate.\"\nSince that time Morarji Desai himself has been a prime minister and again the question was brought up. Now he was in a difficult situation. As a Gandhian he is against birth control.\nInstead of birth control, celibacy is the solution. In the first place he should have considered that teaching rats birth control is going against Gandhian philosophy. They should be taught how to be celibate.\nSecondly, when he was in opposition he had himself proposed that birth control was the only solution. They cannot be killed, even though because of them the whole of India is suffering from poverty. Now that he was in the ruling party, the prime minister, he could not go against his word. He was in a difficult situation. And by this time the rats had grown far bigger and far more numerous than at the time of Indira.\nRight now they are eating three times more than the Indian population. Soon they will starve the whole population, but the politician cowards will not take any step. Morarji put it aside into the file, saying that an investigation should be made of how to introduce birth control to the rats. This is the way of the cunning politicians -- always create an investigation committee which does great work in two, three years; then take their report and file it away.\nBy that time most probably the prime minister is gone, and the new prime minister has no obligation to be bothered with any report that had been asked for by the previous one.\nIt is strange that people can see human beings dying, but they cannot hurt their stupid feelings, which they call religious feelings. The whole idea is so stupid!\nThe elephant god Ganesh is a myth. The story is that Shiva's wife was taking a bath. It seems she must have been taking a bath for the first time in her life, because so much dust and rust came off her body. In the bathroom she became playful, and made a statue from that rust and dust. And because she is a goddess, she was able to breathe life into the statue. That is how Ganesh was born.\nAnd she told Ganesh, \"I am taking a bath, so you sit down outside on the steps. Your father is out, don't allow anybody in.\" But he had no idea of the father ... Who is the father? In fact nobody has any idea who the father is. It is not only Ganesh; everybody simply believes, and often their belief is not the case.\nShiva came, and Shiva is a very angry god ... Ganesh stopped him, saying, \"My mother is taking a bath.\"\nShiva said, \"Your mother? I have been gone. How have you been born?\" In a rage he cut off the head of Ganesh, and threw the head into the valley -- they lived in the Himalayas. He entered the house and asked his wife, \"What is the matter? Who was this fellow sitting outside. I cut off his head and threw the head into the valley.\"\nHis wife was very angry. She told the whole story of how she had made him. He said, \"My God, I have killed my own son!\"\nHe went in search, but how to find where that head had gone? He just found a small elephant, so he cut off the head of the elephant and put it on top of the child's body. Being a supreme God, he managed to glue them together perfectly. But because the child was small Osho - The Miracle\n103\nChapter 8 - Joy in the morning\nand the head was too heavy, the child needed some kind of horse or vehicle to carry him, he could not walk with all that weight. And these stupid ideas have prevailed with millions of people.\nSo Shiva looked around and found a rat, and Ganesh rides on the rat. Such a poor fellow, the rat is carrying such a load ... And he is loved and worshipped all over India, most particularly in Maharashtra. Morarji Desai should consult Shiva about how he managed to teach the rat to carry Ganesh.\nSo nobody can say that it is a simple matter, \"just kill those rats.\" Anybody who says that most probably will be killed. Particularly no politician is going to take the risk, because then who is going to vote for him? Being against the rat, no politician can win. And the rat has been doing so much harm that just ten years more and he will finish everything and leave this country a graveyard. But still the politicians will not take any step.\nMore about rats: \"The rat has been used as a symbol of the cosmos. The head, neck, and body signify the upper planes of atma, which means self; buddhi, which means intelligence; and higher manas, the awareness, consciousness. Each leg of the rat represents a different plane: the lower manas, the lower mind, the astral mind, the ethereal mind, and other physical aspects.\"\nThese idiots who go on making such metaphors and symbols should be imprisoned and punished, but they are worshipped and respected as great scholars.\n\"The Dakotan explanation for why the moon wanes is that it is eaten by a multitude of rats.\nIn Germanic belief, the soul assumes the form of a rat or mouse, and in this form may come forth from a sleeper's mouth.\"\nSo beware! Never allow your mouth to open in your sleep. The rat may escape.\nI have heard a story that Nancy Reagan phoned her doctor, \"Come quickly! A rat has entered into snoring Ronald's mouth!\"\nThe doctor said, \"I am coming, but it will take a few minutes. Meanwhile you do one thing, hold a small piece of cheese over his mouth. Perhaps the rat may come back out.\"\nWhen the doctor arrived after ten minutes, he could not believe his eyes. Nancy was waving a cat over Ronald's face. He said, \"My God, this way the rat will go even deeper! I told you to hold a piece of cheese!\"\nShe said, \"I did, but the rat pulled the cheese in! Now I am holding the cat to pull the rat and the cheese both out. Now that you have come, I can relax, you do the work!\"\nBut this really was a religious belief in Germany.\nObviously the soul must enter from somewhere and must get out from somewhere; some door is needed, and the mouth seems to be the right place for it. If you are sleeping with somebody else, then it is even more dangerous -- somebody else's rat may enter your mouth.\nAlways keep your mouth shut, for safety and security. Neither allow the inner one to go out, nor allow an outside one to come in!\n\"The name of the rat is taboo in some parts of Europe. In Bohemia a white mouse should not be killed, it should be taken out of the trap and fed. Otherwise luck will desert the house Osho - The Miracle\n104\nChapter 8 - Joy in the morning\nand other rats will increase in number. Sometimes spells are used to keep down the number of rats.\nElsewhere four pairs of rats are married and set adrift -- with the idea that this will cause the other rats to go away.\"\nWhen they see that the others are going on their honeymoon ... just get your own boat and go on a honeymoon too. Why are you wasting your life unnecessarily in those dark holes, when others are enjoying the fresh air on the river? The idea seems to be good.\n\"Rats are an omen of death in Austria. In other places they are a good omen.\nIn Zoroastrianism the rat is an evil animal, and the killing of one rat equals in merit the slaying of four lions.\"\nSo don't be worried -- if you are a rat, you are equal to four lions. If your wife calls you a rat, she is saying, \"You are equal to four lions.\"\n\"In Jewish folklore, eating anything gnawed by a rat causes loss of memory. Thus cats, which eat rats, don't remember their masters.\"\nRats destroy the memory system; that's why cats go on forgetting who is their master.\nDogs never eat rats so they always remember their master.\nAnd simultaneously Anando is also contributing something to Avirbhava's Museum of Gods, the monkey.\nThe monkey has also been a problem in India. You cannot shoot a monkey -- a monkey can shoot you, there is no constitutional law against that.\nIn the capital of North India, Lucknow, there is a very beautiful temple of the monkey-god Hanuman. Surrounded by great trees, it is a very ancient temple, and hundreds of monkeys live on those trees. People go with food, flowers, sweets, and those monkeys ... of course Hanuman is just a stone monkey, but the real monkeys are all around and they are flourishing, becoming stronger.\nSomething happened suddenly in 1955. Nobody knows the actual cause, but the monkeys became violent at the sight of any kind of uniform. So the policeman, the postman, the military man, the sannyasin ... none of them could pass down that street. Those monkeys would jump on them and hit them hard, tear away\ntheir clothes and they would have to run naked, oozing blood, down a main street in Lucknow. And the assembly of Lucknow could not decide what to do.\nIt is something strange that both monkeys and dogs are against uniforms -- both seem to be very revolutionary. Uniformed people are very orthodox, all just imitating each other. Dogs immediately start barking when they see the postman or the policeman or the sannyasin; anybody who wears a uniform provokes dogs and monkeys to fight against this traditionalism.\nIt used to be that monkeys only made faces and threatened from the trees. But in Lucknow\n-- perhaps somebody had hurt them, nobody knows the cause -- for fifteen days they made such a chaos that the whole market had to be closed. And the government could not decide to shoot those monkeys, because if they were shot the whole Hindu population's religious heart would be hurt. But since nobody came on that road anymore, those monkeys came to their senses -- because now no more food was available. So finally they decided not to harm people Osho - The Miracle\n105\nChapter 8 - Joy in the morning\nany longer. They could see the point -- if nobody passes on the road, nobody comes to the temple, they don't get any food or flowers. Otherwise they were the blessed monkeys, very rich.\nSeeing the situation, after fifteen days they had to surrender. Slowly, slowly people started opening their shops again, moving on the street, cautiously at first. And the government had alerted the people that nobody should shoot a monkey. Rather than calling the army to shoot the monkeys, they ordered people, \"If you shoot a monkey you will be thought a criminal, and you will be treated just as if you have shot a man. No distinction will be made!\"\nThese poor politicians are ruling all over the world, and they are ruled by all kinds of superstitions and stupidities.\n\"Zoolatry, or the worship of animals, is not uncommon in the East. The monkey is among those animals worshipped, like the tiger and the snake, out of fear.\nIt is said that the monkey is a symbol of the lower mind which imitates or reflects the higher, or represents the automatic mind. The monkey god, Hanuman, son of Vayu, the god of winds, is worshipped today in India. He is a symbol of the intellect which comes from the higher mind, Vayu.\nAnd in the orthodox villages in India the monkey is always free from harm and is magic.\nIts magic influence is implored against the whirlwind, and it is also invoked to avert sterility.\nThe bones of monkeys are said to pollute the ground. Mentioning a monkey brings starvation for the rest of the day, but it is regarded as lucky to keep one in the stable.\nIt is seriously believed in Africa and South America that monkeys can talk, but do not for fear of being made to work.\"\nThat is really good ... if they talk there is every danger man will force them to work. It is better to keep quiet.\nI have heard about a small child who would not talk. He was taken to this psychologist, to that psychiatrist, to a psychoanalyst ... nobody could get him to utter a single word. He could hear perfectly well; he was checked, his ears were perfect. But he would not show even a sign from his eyes or face that he had heard anything.\nBut one day at the dining table he said to his mother, \"Where's the salt?\" The mother said, \"My God, you have never spoken before.\"\nHe said, \"Nothing was ever missing before, why should I have spoken? I heard all those psychoanalysts and psychiatrists and all the nonsense they were talking. But to speak means going to school, and I hate school. It's just because of the salt that I had to speak now, in spite of myself. But this is just between me and you, don't tell anybody. I am never going to speak again, so nobody would believe you anyway.\"\nThere was not a witness, either. The mother was at a loss. She told her husband, but the husband said, \"It is not possible, six years silence and suddenly ... You\nwill have to give me proof. Make him speak again.\"\nBut he would not speak, he had made the point clear that speaking meant going to school.\nOsho - The Miracle 106\nChapter 8 - Joy in the morning\nThis idea in South America and South Africa -- both faraway places -- is that monkeys understand your language, but they will not speak just out of fear that they would be forced to work.\n\"Another story suggests that apes carry off women to the woods. In many places respect for the monkey is based on the belief that it is the abode of the human spirit.\nAmong the Hottentots, the killer of a baboon has to sacrifice a sheep or goat and hang the lowest vertebrae around his neck, or he will suffer from lumbago. In China the monkey is regarded as lucky in that it keeps sickness away, while in Java an offering made to the king of the monkeys is believed to cure sterility.\"\nNow, Avirbhava, bring your rat, and Anando, your monkeys.\n(AVIRBHAVA PUTS A BIG, BLACK TOY RAT AT THE MASTER'S FEET. IT\nSTARTS DANCING AND MAKING COMICAL SOUNDS. SHE ALSO PUTS A CLOCKWORK MONKEY ON THE PODIUM WHICH WANDERS AROUND THE\nMASTER'S FEET. ANANDO SITS A SMALL RUBBER MONKEY ON THE\nPODIUM.) Very meditative monkey! Well, where are your small monkeys?\n(MANY LITTLE MONKEYS ARE PUT ON THE PODIUM. MEANWHILE AVIRBHAVA'S MONKEY IS RUNNING AWAY AND AVIRBHAVA HAS TO\nJUMP TO\nCATCH IT. EVERYBODY IS LAUGHING.)\nJust give a good clap, too.\nNow, remove your gods. Just ask all the sannyasins around the world to find out about all the animals that have been worshipped by human beings -- to show to everyone what kind of past we have had. And there are still people who are worshipping animals.\nReligion has been reduced to such nonsense. And the harm is that people become involved in these absolutely absurd ideas and forget completely about themselves. The only religion is the religion of being conscious. All other religions are simply toys for children.\nBut we go on living unconsciously, without seeing what people are doing. They celebrate monkeys, elephants, they worship even rats. This is such an undignified state of affairs that it has to be changed completely.\nSo Avirbhava's Museum of Gods will be immensely significant for visitors -- to show them, \"This is your past, this is your religion, and this is still your present. You cannot simply say that it is past. And do you want to realize yourself through rats?\"\nThis museum will provide a great insight to anybody who comes here without any prejudice. But it will bring many law cases against me, although we are not harming their gods -- they will be taken care of -- we are just putting them in a museum, where all your scriptures and all your ideologies also belong.\nWe want a complete break from the past so that man can have his wings to fly into the sky of consciousness, absolutely free. That is the revolution of Zen.\nOsho - The Miracle 107\nChapter 8 - Joy in the morning YUN-MEN SAID:\nMY DUTY COMPELS ME TO ATTEMPT THE IMPOSSIBLE. EVEN IN TELLING\nYOU TO LOOK DIRECTLY INTO YOURSELF AND TO BE UNCONCERNED ABOUT\nOTHER THINGS, I AM ALREADY BURYING THE REAL THING UNDER VERBIAGE.\nThis is the way the authentic master speaks, even knowing perfectly well that he is doing something wrong. Speaking about the truth is not right, but it is absolutely necessary to give some indication. Words are used not for themselves, but to indicate the wordless; sounds are used to indicate the soundless, the silence.\nYun-Men says:\nI AM ALREADY BURYING THE REAL THING UNDER VERBIAGE.\nHe is asking your forgiveness.\nIF YOU PROCEED FROM THENCE AND SET OUT IN QUEST OF WORDS AND\nSENTENCES, CUDGELING YOUR BRAINS OVER THEIR LOGICAL MEANINGS, WORKING OUT A THOUSAND POSSIBILITIES AND TEN THOUSAND SUBTLE\nDISTINCTIONS, AND CREATING ENDLESS QUESTIONS AND DEBATES, ALL THAT\nYOU WILL GAIN THEREBY IS A GLIB TONGUE, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME YOU\nWILL BE GETTING FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM THE WAY, WITH NO\nREST TO YOUR WANDERING.\nTO FOLLOW THE INTENTIONS AND VAGARIES OF YOUR MIND IS TO\nBE\nSEPARATED FROM YOUR SELF AS FAR AS THE EARTH FROM THE SKY.\nBUT IF YOU HAVE REALLY FOUND YOUR TRUE SELF, THEN YOU CAN PASS\nTHROUGH FIRE WITHOUT BEING BURNED, SPEAK A WHOLE DAY WITHOUT\nREALLY MOVING YOUR LIPS AND TEETH, AND WITHOUT HAVING REALLY\nUTTERED A SINGLE WORD, WEAR YOUR CLOTHES AND TAKE YOUR MEAL\nEVERY DAY WITHOUT REALLY TOUCHING A SINGLE GRAIN OF RICE OR A SINGLE THREAD OF SILK . EVEN THIS TALK IS BUT A DECORATION ON THE\nDOOR OF OUR HOUSE. THE IMPORTANT THING IS YOUR EXPERIENTIAL\nREALIZATION OF THIS STATE.\nHe is saying that in your innermost being the unknown, the miraculous, the buddha, lives.\nIt cannot be burned. Your consciousness cannot be burned or destroyed by any other means. It is indestructible. He is not referring to your body. Your body may be burned, you cannot pass through fire; you may be drowned in water. He is referring to your innermost being -- of which you are unaware -- which is the source of your life.\nIn meditation you have to find that space, that clear sky, and then a metamorphosis, a revolution, happens on its own accord. You start changing without any effort because of the new clarity, the new light, the new experience, the new acquaintance with yourself. The whole existence becomes new.\nA man who knows himself cannot worship rats, a man who knows himself cannot worship monkeys or elephants, a man who knows himself cannot worship at all! -- because worship is outward. He cannot pray at all, because all prayers are addressed to somebody else. He can only meditate, he can only be silently drowned in his own splendor -- which is not his own.\nOsho - The Miracle 108\nChapter 8 - Joy in the morning\nSlowly, slowly as meditation deepens he becomes aware that it is the splendor of our whole universe.\nWe are not only parts, we are one with the whole. The whole expresses itself in many ways, then everything becomes divine; the very earth you are sitting on becomes divine, and whatever you are doing becomes divine. But first you have to find the divine element within yourself. It is not a belief system; it is an inquiry, it is as scientific an investigation as any science can claim.\nIn fact no science is as scientific as meditation, because all sciences deny the existence of the scientist. They are experimenting with things, but they don't want to say anything about who is working inside them, about what it is. On that point they remain absolutely silent because it cannot be made objective, it cannot be put on their table so they can dissect it and find all the elements in it; it is non-material.\nHence the scientist is bound to remain with the superstition that the world is only objective, that the world has only the outside. Can you see the irrationality in it? The outside can exist only if there is an inside. If you deny the inside you cannot accept the outside, they both come together. The mystic is more scientific in the way he accepts the beauty of the world, the universe, and the way he accepts the beauty and splendor of his own being.\nRyokan wrote:\nIF YOU SPEAK DELUSIONS, EVERYTHING BECOMES A DELUSION:\nIF YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH, EVERYTHING BECOMES THE TRUTH.\nOUTSIDE THE TRUTH THERE IS NO DELUSION, BUT OUTSIDE DELUSION THERE IS NO SPECIAL TRUTH.\nFOLLOWERS OF BUDDHA'S WAY!\nWHY DO YOU SO EARNESTLY SEEK THE TRUTH IN DISTANT PLACES?\nLOOK FOR DELUSION AND TRUTH IN THE BOTTOM OF YOUR OWN HEARTS.\nDon't go anywhere, just go in.\nAnd Ekon's haiku, so small, but so immensely beautiful: JOY IN THE MORNING,\nSLEEP IN THE EVENING, WHAT ELSE?\nOsho - The Miracle 109\nChapter 8 - Joy in the morning\nIf you can feel the joy in the morning, if you can feel the joy of being alive, every breath becomes a blessing, is a blessing. If you can see sleep as a great rest and relaxation in the evening, what else do you want?\nIn your insight everything becomes a joy and everything points to the same moon, the same truth.\nQuestion 1 Maneesha has asked:\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\nI CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN YOU LAST PAUSED TO LOOK AT YOUR WATCH\nTO DECIDE WHETHER TO SPEAK FURTHER OR NOT.\nDOES THAT MEAN WE HAVE BEEN JUICIER TO BE WITH LATELY?\nManeesha, it means many things. It certainly means that my assembly of buddhas has become juicier, it has become more alert, less judgmental, more experimental. It also means that when you are all so deeply involved, I don't have to look at my watch. When I see somebody disturbed, fidgeting, feeling that it is too late, only then have I looked at my watch.\nI haven't looked at it for years.\nSometimes it doesn't show the time at all, there is nothing to look at. One day Shunyo reminded me, \"Your watch ... it is seven and your watch is saying four.\"\nI said, \"It does not matter.\"\nAs my days are becoming fewer and fewer on this earth, nothing matters except one thing: that I should pour myself into you as much as possible. Tomorrow I may not be here, so I should complete the celebration today. Tomorrow you may have to celebrate alone.\nThe whole credit goes to Ronald Reagan. Poisoning me he has taken away from you at least twenty years of my life. I am fighting with the poison and it has been a good challenge for me, but for you it can be a loss any moment. I am just living on the fringe. So when I go to sleep I say good-bye to the world, because I don't know for certain that tomorrow morning I will wake up. When I wake up I am amazed that there is one more day, one more celebration, one more day to laugh with my people, to be part of their silences, to have my heart beat with their hearts. Looking at the watch has become irrelevant.\nI go on wearing the watch so that you don't become afraid. Because if I don't wear the watch, you can be certain that my time is up.\nNow something really serious:\nMagnus Marx wants to buy a talking parrot for his wife's birthday. He hears that a rare Brazilian banana-parrot is being auctioned, so he goes to the salesroom to have a look at it.\nThe auctioneer puts the bird up on the stand in front of the crowded sales room. \"Twenty-five dollars,\" bids Magnus.\nOsho - The Miracle 110\nChapter 8 - Joy in the morning \"Thirty-five!\" comes another bidder.

DO NOT DESIRE THE THREE \"GIFTS OF VISION,\" AND THE SIX\n\"SUPERNATURAL POWERS.\" WHY? BECAUSE THESE ARE ONLY ACCIDENTALS\nOF HOLINESS.\nTHE ONE THING ESSENTIAL NOW IS TO RECOLLECT YOUR MIND TO ATTAIN\nTHE FUNDAMENTAL, THE VERY ROOT OF YOUR BEING. HAVING ARRIVED AT\nTHE ROOT, YOU NEED HAVE NO WORRY ABOUT THE ACCIDENTALS. IN TIME\nYOU WILL FIND THAT YOU ARE SELF-PROVIDED WITH ALL THESE\nACCIDENTAL GIFTS AND POWERS. ON THE OTHER HAND, SO LONG AS YOU\nOsho - The Miracle 114\nChapter 9 - The simple task of turning in\nHAVE NOT GOT AT THE ROOT, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE SUCH\nGIFTS AND POWERS THROUGH STUDY AND LEARNING.\nManeesha, basically there is only one way of discovering the buddha, the truth of your very being. But there are thousands of people with different states of consciousness; hence for them, different devices, different small streets joining to the main way, have to be created.\nThat's what all the Zen masters in the fourteen-hundred-year history of Zen have been trying very diligently to do.\nNo one is being left out; everybody is shown a way that may fit them. But finally, whatever fits you will lead you to the ultimate way: turning in. Every device is dedicated to the simple task of turning in.\nAs the situation is, man is born with five senses which all go outwards. Nature has not given you a special sense that goes inwards.\nYour eyes open outwards; if you close them there is only darkness. Or even with closed eyes you will still see things of the outside world as imagination, as dreams. Ears can hear only the music that comes from the outside; they know nothing about the music that is continuously happening within you. Nobody is born with an ear to hear the inner music. Your hands stretch outside. Even the smallest child starts grabbing outside things.\nObviously this state of affairs, that all our senses open outwards, has been exploited. We have been given every kind of theology, religion, truth, from the outside, because that is what we are demanding. We want a God to be there above in the sky. We want anything and immediately there will be a supplier.\nYou just have to ask and somebody will create a system of beliefs to satisfy you.\nZen cuts all this rubbish like a sharp sword in one single blow. It has nothing to do with anything that takes you away from you; it may be God, it may be hell, it may be heaven -- all kinds of rewards and all kinds of fears about punishment. All the religions are living on the exploitation of your senses because they open outwards.\nThe work of a real master is to close all these doors so that your life energy, your consciousness, does not leak out. There is no naturally given way to go inwards, but it is not needed. If enough consciousness is gathered in, it will create its own way, just as water creates its own way -- no map, no guidelines, just enough quantity and the water will start flowing towards an unknown sea. It has never heard about, knows nothing about, where it is going.\nThe same is true about consciousness. Enough consciousness gathered inside immediately makes a way upon which nobody has ever trodden, and starts moving inwards. Outward senses are closed; that's what I mean when I say in your meditations to close your eyes, to leave the body completely behind ... because all the senses are joined with the body. Just be a watcher of the mind, so the mind cannot take your energy outside. With body and mind both closed energy gathers upon itself spontaneously, and at a certain point it starts moving inwards. You don't have to do anything except to close all the doors that lead you away from yourself.\nIt is one of the simplest things because you don't have to do it. But just because of its simplicity, its obviousness, it has become difficult -- the most difficult, because nobody can teach you; nobody can indicate to you where to move, how to move. The master can only create a situation in which the spontaneous movement of the energy will happen.\nOsho - The Miracle 115\nChapter 9 - The simple task of turning in\nThat's what I call meditation. It is not your doing. You have to stop doing everything. It is your non-doing.\nAnd the moment when you are not doing, all your energy that was involved in doing a thousand and one things is released. It gathers to a point where it starts flowing inwards, and the innermost center is not far away.\nMeditation is, in a way, going beyond nature. Hence it is called transcendental. Nature has not provided any automatic way, like it has provided eyes, hands, ears; it has not provided any way for your energy to go in. Meditation is transcending the natural gifts, moving beyond nature. It is not against nature, it is simply towards a greater nature, more overwhelming, more universal.\nAnd once you have found the way and you have touched your own being, you have gone through a magic. You will never be the same person again. Not only that, the world that surrounds you will never be the same again. Now your love will have a new fragrance -- not the old possessiveness, domination. Your friendship will be more friendliness than friendship.\nIt will not have any bondage, any conditionings. Your vision of the world will become immensely intense and sharp. You will see things which have been there always, present, but you were not present.\nEach flower is showing something of the divine. Each star is shining, showing something of the divine. The whole existence in its multitude of expressions is showing only the divine, but you will recognize it only on the condition that you have recognized it within yourself.\nThen you know that your center is not only your center, it is the center of the whole universe.\nWe are all joined in this center.\nIt is said about Bacon -- a great scientific thinker, perhaps the most important, because he turned the whole human mind from religion to science ... He used to say, \"If I can find the center of the world I can move the world according to me.\" But he never found the center of the world, and I say unto you he has never heard that in the East we have been searching not the center of the world but the center of ourselves. Finding the center of ourselves we have found the center of the universe. But then the desire for change drops. The universe is so beautiful, nothing needs to be changed; everything has to be rejoiced and celebrated.\nThese statements of a great master Ejaku are very fundamental.\nEJAKU SAID:\nLET EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU TURN THE LIGHT INWARDS UPON\nHIMSELF, AND NOT TRY TO MEMORIZE MY WORDS.\nOnly a very great master can say that -- don't bother about my words, because they don't contain the truth. No words can contain it, so don't memorize them. I am saying to you, \"Turn in.\" But you can do two things: you can memorize the words \"turn in\" or you can do another thing ... existentially, you can turn in. That's what Ejaku is saying: \"I am not saying these words to you so that you can memorize my words.\"\nSINCE TIME WITHOUT BEGINNING, YOU HAVE TURNED YOUR BACK UPON\nTHE LIGHT AND RUN AFTER DARKNESS. THE HABITS OF ERRONEOUS\nTHINKING ARE SO DEEP-ROOTED IN YOU THAT IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY\nDIFFICULT TO UPROOT THEM OVERNIGHT.\nOsho - The Miracle 116\nChapter 9 - The simple task of turning in\nIt is obviously true, but with great respect to Ejaku I disagree.\nHowever many lives you may have been wandering outside, it does not matter. You can come to yourself in a single moment. It is just like a man asleep. He may be anywhere in the world, visiting Moscow or Peking or Tokyo or going to the moon -- just wake him up. Do you think he will say, \"Wait, I have to catch a train to come back from Tokyo?\" Or, \"From Moscow I have to take a plane; I cannot just wake up immediately.\" He does not say that, he simply wakes up and wonders ... instantaneously. The projection is a dream. All our projections -- of\ngreed, lust, power, anger -- are simply dreams.\nEjaku is right as a common-sense approach. But I don't agree, because I know you can be a buddha this very moment. All the wanderings in past lives into darkness cannot prevent you. It is like saying a room has been dark for centuries and you bring a small candlelight ... the darkness cannot say, \"I will not go so immediately. I have been here occupying this room for centuries. It goes against the constitution of India; you cannot throw away the occupant in a single moment. Go through a proper channel. First go to the court, claim that you have the right.\" But the darkness does not say anything. You just bring a small candle, and the darkness disappears.\nIn fact the darkness has no substance. It is an absence. So when you bring the light, the absence disappears; it was the absence of the light.\nIf you can go in, pushing aside the whole crowd of habits -- just like an arrow, with force, gathering your whole energy inwards -- you can prove Ejaku wrong. Although what he is saying is out of compassion, perhaps most people will have to follow what he is saying.\nTHE HABITS OF ERRONEOUS THINKING ARE SO DEEP-ROOTED IN YOU THAT\nIT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO UPROOT THEM OVERNIGHT.\nI say unto you it is extremely simple to throw them this very moment. Those habits have been formed in darkness and unconsciousness; they don't have any substance in them.\nI was talking to a friend. He was a professor in the same university I was, and he was continuously harassing me -- \"Do something! I want to drop this habit of smoking. Many times I try: one hour, two hours, three hours, and then it becomes too much. The urge ... I think, 'It is better to have a cigarette. Next time we will try in better conditions; right now I am too tense.' So many times I have decided, but it fails. Every time, rather than being a success it has been a failure, and now it has become written in my memory that I cannot succeed. Just show me how to drop it.\"\nI said, \"Are you ready?\"\nHe said, \"I am ready to do anything.\"\nThen I said, \"Do one thing. Come with me to my home, and I will not let you out until this habit is gone.\"\nHe said, \"What do you mean? Are you going to torture me or something?\"\nI said, \"No torture, just chain smoking. Sitting before me you have to smoke to your heart's content.\"\nHe said, \"I never heard such a thing from anybody else. I have been talking about dropping this habit.\"\nOsho - The Miracle 117\nChapter 9 - The simple task of turning in\nI said, \"You have been bragging. All this talk about dropping this habit is just a strategy of the mind to brag that 'I am trying, but what to do?' But today you are caught in a lion's den.\nJust come and sit behind me in my car and forget the world. On the way we will purchase cigarettes -- as many as the car can contain.\"\nHe said, \"My God, you will kill me!\"\nI said, \"It does not matter. Either you will leave dead or you will leave the habit!\"\nHesitantly, afraid, he said, \"I always have heard that you are a strange type, but I never thought that just by telling you I would get trapped. Do you really mean it?\"\nI said, \"Just sit down in the car, and on the way I will fill the whole car ...\"\nHe was looking at me and he said, \"What are you doing? That much smoking will kill me!\"\nI said, \"There is no way out now. Chain smoking means chain smoking. When\nyou drop one cigarette, immediately take another; take the fire from the first cigarette to the second cigarette. And I will be watching.\"\nJust after three or four packets he said, \"Can I go home, before ...\"\n\"No way! Either your dead body will go out, or you will have to drop this habit that you have been bragging about.\"\nHe said, \"I promise.\"\nI said, \"I don't want to interfere in anybody else's life, but you offered yourself.\"\nHe burned his lips, he burned his hands. It must have taken about six hours, and after six hours he was so tired ... smoking and smoking. And a crowd of the neighbors gathered, and they started talking -- \"Is this man mad or something?\" And all over, cigarettes and ashes.\nFinally he said, \"Let me go!\"\nI said, \"I will not let you go. Do you see my guard? He will put you back in your place, and if you don't smoke he will force you to smoke. This time or never!\"\nHe said, \"It is better I drop this habit. But let me go home!\"\nI said, \"Be a man of your word. If you are found smoking again you will have to commit suicide -- hara-kiri. A man of his word has no other way. If he goes against his word, he has to commit hara-kiri.\"\nHe said, \"I promise. I will commit hara-kiri, but at least right now let me go home!\"\nI followed him for many days. He tried to escape, he wouldn't look at me. But when I take something into my hands I do it.\nI used to go every day to his home to ask his wife how things were going. She was of course on my side; she was my detective in his home. Even the small children of the poor professor were all working for me. They would say, \"Uncle, you have done a miracle! He is so afraid. Even to mention the word 'cigarette' and he starts perspiring. That experience you have given him ... Since that experience -- we don't know what experience, he simply says, 'Since that\nexperience I am finished. Because that man is so dangerous, if I even touch a cigarette he will force me to commit hara-kiri. And I want to live, cigarettes or no cigarettes.'\"\nThe question is, if you have really decided, if you are in an honest search for yourself, then you can prove Ejaku wrong. And I would like you to prove him wrong, although he is making Osho - The Miracle\n118\nChapter 9 - The simple task of turning in\na very common-sense statement. Ordinarily it takes lives to drop old habits. But that simply means you are not really wanting to drop them. If you want to drop, it takes only a simple, single moment, because all old habits are your own projections.\nTHIS IS WHY ONE IS COMPELLED TO RESORT TO THE USE OF MAKE- BELIEVE\nEXPEDIENTS IN ORDER TO STRIP YOU OF YOUR CRUDE WAYS OF THINKING.\nTHIS IS ON A PAR WITH WHAT A PARENT SOMETIMES WOULD DO IN ORDER\nTO STOP HIS LITTLE CHILD FROM CRYING -- GIVING HIM SOME YELLOW\nLEAVES, MAKING BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE PRECIOUS COINS. IT IS ALSO LIKE\nA MAN SETTING UP A STORE STOCKED WITH ALL KINDS OF GOODS FOR DAILY\nUSE, AS WELL AS ARTICLES OF GOLD AND JADE, TO ACCOMMODATE\nCUSTOMERS OF DIFFERENT ABILITIES. AS I HAVE OFTEN SAID, SEKITO'S IS A GOLD SHOP, WHILE MINE IS A GENERAL STORE ...\nSekito is sitting here in front of me, behind the camera. In this new reincarnation he is called Niskriya, the Stonehead. Sekito means the Stonehead. He was a great master.\nEjaku says that Sekito has a gold shop -- only very refined people can become his disciples. Ordinary ones are simply given a good beating and thrown out. They never come back to Sekito's temple. Only very rare, extraordinary seekers will take all the beatings but will not leave the steps. Sometimes it happened that a person would sit there for months before Sekito would allow him to come in. It may be raining, it may be winter, it may be summer, but unless Sekito is convinced that the man has a will, that he has not come just out of curiosity but in every way he wants to seek and search himself ...\n... WHILE MINE IS A GENERAL STORE, SELLING ALL AND SUNDRY.\nEjaku was a different kind of master -- not hard, he never hit anybody. He never slapped any disciple. Naturally he attracted the wishy-washy people. But in a general store you cannot find great shoppers like Avirbhava. Now she has gone to Hong Kong to find other gods worshipped in the past, because there is going to be a fair of toys. She is not here today.\nYesterday she did her show of the great rat. Now she has gone in search of finding something even greater.\nEjaku is saying, \"I serve all and sundry; even the curious ones are accepted. One never knows: today the person may be curious, tomorrow he may become really a longing. A chance has to be given.\"\nBoth are right. Sekito works on the very special ones; Ejaku works on everyone, of any category. Both are needed.\nIF I DEALT ONLY WITH THE ESSENCE OF MEDITATION, I WOULD BE LEFT\nALL ALONE.\nTo deal with the essence of meditation alone ... that's what I am doing. But even dealing only with meditation, I don't have a general store. I have my ways of choosing the best and the most intelligent. Just because of my words, those who are curious will not stay here. There is nothing for them here.\nThose who have stayed with me have stayed because they started feeling the essence of meditation, slowly slowly, like a cool breeze or a full-moon night or a roseflower in all its beauty. They have found something, and now they are certain there is much more. This certainty creates trust. And without this trust, Ejaku is right: if a man simply deals with Osho - The Miracle\n119\nChapter 9 - The simple task of turning in\nmeditation he will be left alone, because who wants meditation? And when there is no demand, what is the point of keeping the store open?\nI have tried in a unique way to call forth from all over the world the most intelligent ones. I am not alone. It is not only that you are here -- there are two million people around the earth who are meditating, whose only concern is meditation; everything else in life has become meaningless.\nBut Ejaku is making a common sense statement: if you deal only with meditation, people will desert you. Seeing this, masters deal with scriptures, mantras, to keep you engaged. Some day may come the right moment that you can be introduced into meditation.\nI am totally different from Sekito or Ejaku, although I am doing the same work. But neither do I hit you, nor do I push you away, nor do I wait. I make the atmosphere available to you. All kinds of people, in this atmosphere, can have a little experience. And that little experience starts growing just like a seed grows into a huge cedar, aspiring to the stars.\nThose who were more concerned with non-essentials have come and gone. In these thirty years thousands of people have passed -- but now, as we are coming to the most precious experience, deeper and deeper, only those who are authentically interested in digging for the gold have remained.\nNow this assembly has become one of the greatest assemblies of seekers that has ever been on the earth.\nEjaku says: IF I DEALT ONLY WITH THE ESSENCE OF MEDITATION, I WOULD\nBE LEFT ALL ALONE.\nOrdinarily that is true.\nEVEN A SINGLE COMPANION WOULD BE HARD TO GET, TO SAY NOTHING OF\nA COMMUNITY OF FIVE OR SEVEN HUNDRED MONKS. IF, ON THE OTHER HAND, I TALKED ABOUT THINGS OF EAST AND WEST, PEOPLE WOULD COME IN\nFLOCKS, PRICKING UP THEIR EARS TO CATCH EVERY BIT OF MY TALES. THAT\nWOULD BE LIKE SHOWING AN EMPTY FIST TO LITTLE CHILDREN, PRETENDING\nTHAT THERE ARE CANDIES IN IT. THIS IS JUST HUMBUG.\nHe is very honest. He is saying, \"I have to create all kinds of things, but all those things are just humbug.\" Just as you can engage a child with toys and he forgets that he was crying, you can engage thousands of people ... in fact they are engaged. What are the churches doing, what are the synagogues doing, what are the temples doing? Dealing with non-essentials. And flocks of millions of people\n... And these holy places and these so-called great priests go on watching what the need of the people is. They immediately supply their need, so that they remain entangled in the net of Hinduism or Christianity or Judaism.\nI have heard that three rabbis were talking about their congregations. The first rabbi said,\n\"My congregation is the most up-to-date. You can even smoke cigarettes inside the synagogue. You can play cards and gamble.\"\nThe second one said, \"That is nothing. In my synagogue I have already entered the twenty-first century. People can make love and do whatever they want to do. They can drink wine, they can dance. After all, one has to have a congregation; otherwise we will lose our profession, our salaries. So whatever they want to do, let them do.\"\nOsho - The Miracle 120\nChapter 9 - The simple task of turning in\nThe third one said, \"That's nothing. In my synagogue there is a sign in front of the synagogue on which it is written, 'This synagogue is closed on Saturdays and all Jewish holidays.'\" What more do you want? This is the most ultra-modern! People are happy, very much rejoiced, to be members of a synagogue which is always closed, which does not bother them at all with old sermons.\nBut all the religions have been keeping people engaged with the non-essentials.\nEjaku is very sincere. He says, \"It is not in my capacity to deal only with the essential Zen.\nI know that I will not find even a single companion. So I go on giving them devices, scriptures, mantras and all kinds of things -- a general store. But it is all humbug.\"\nDo you know what 'humbug' means? It was Charles Darwin's sixtieth birthday, and he was very friendly with children. So all the children of the neighborhood decided, \"Precious presents will be coming to the great scientist. We poor children, what can we do? But something has to be presented to the great scientist who is our friend.\" So one small boy came up with a great idea, and they managed it. They found all kinds of insects ... because that was the interest of Charles Darwin. Working out his theory of evolution, he was looking into insects, into animals, in every place.\nWhat they did was cut up all those insects and made a new insect. The body of one insect, the legs of another, the face of a third, the tail of a fourth ... and they made it so perfectly and beautifully that anybody could be deceived. They brought their present to the great Darwin and asked him, \"Uncle, can you say what it is? You are such a great scientist, you must know the name.\"\nHe looked and he could not imagine ... He had never come across such an insect. He looked again and again, and then finally he saw that it was not one insect -- the legs are different, the tail is different, the head is different. But the boys had done a great artistic job, so he said, \"This is a humbug. Its name is humbug.\"\nMost of the people are humbugs. They are carrying something from somebody, something from somebody else. They are not themselves, they are many people, a multitude. They are a crowd.\nSays Ejaku:\nNOW, LET ME TELL YOU IN ALL PLAINNESS: DO NOT DIVERT YOUR MIND TO\nTHE HOLY THINGS; RATHER, DIRECT IT TO YOUR SELF-NATURE, AND\nCULTIVATE YOURSELF WITH YOUR FEET ON THE GROUND. DO NOT DESIRE\nTHE THREE \"GIFTS OF VISION,\" AND THE SIX \"SUPERNATURAL POWERS.\" WHY?\nBECAUSE THESE ARE ONLY ACCIDENTALS OF HOLINESS.\nTHE ONE THING ESSENTIAL NOW IS TO RECOLLECT YOUR MIND TO ATTAIN\nTHE FUNDAMENTAL, THE VERY ROOT OF YOUR BEING. HAVING ARRIVED AT\nTHE ROOT, YOU NEED HAVE NO WORRY ABOUT THE ACCIDENTALS.\nAll the virtues come on their own as you become conscious, so don't cultivate those virtues. They will be artificial and they will become preventive, hindrances on the way to your own self.\nOsho - The Miracle 121\nChapter 9 - The simple task of turning in\nDon't ask for miracles. A man of meditation is himself a miracle. Whatever he does is a miracle. It is a beauty, it is magic, but it is all spontaneous. It is not\npracticed, it is not rehearsed.\nBut most people are interested in supernatural powers, healing people with supernatural powers, or creating things out of nothing, just as Satya Sai Baba is doing. All kinds of frauds ... but people become interested in them, thinking that here is a man of miracles. And what is the miracle if you can produce a Swiss watch which was hiding in your sleeve ...?\nOne old Parsi woman came to me in Bombay. Satya Sai Baba used to stay at her place, and she told me, \"One day when he had gone into the bathroom, just out of curiosity I looked into his suitcases. They were all full of watches! I could not believe that this man was deceiving.\"\nShe said, \"I kicked him out. I told him, 'Never again come in my house!' I cannot be a partner to any kind of fraud.\" She told me, \"I am an old woman. Nobody listens to me, they think I have gone senile. I have come to you ... perhaps you can do something about it.\"\nI said, \"I have been challenging Satya Sai Baba, saying that this is stupid. When the country is dying of starvation, produce more food out of your miracles. He should bring rain to Hyderabad\" ... where the Shankaracharya of Puri is going to force a woman to be burned alive on her husband's funeral pyre, and only then rain will come. And Satya Sai Baba is not far away from Hyderabad. Bring rain to Hyderabad -- do some real work! All that he produces is ash, and he gives you the ash and you think it is great. It is so simple that any street magician can do it. In fact the more experienced street magicians can do it in a far better way, and can do many more things than he is doing.\nI have no objection to him as a magician, but he should not pretend to be a spiritual man. It is not only a question of a single person pretending to be spiritual when he is not. The question is that he attracts thousands of people, mediocre people, who believe that this man of miracles may impart something to them, may lead them to the ultimate truth.\nEjaku is right: don't bother about supernatural powers, THREE \"GIFTS OF VISION.\"\nTHE ONE THING ESSENTIAL NOW IS TO RECOLLECT YOUR MIND TO ATTAIN\nTHE FUNDAMENTAL, THE VERY ROOT OF YOUR BEING. HAVING ARRIVED AT\nTHE ROOT, YOU NEED HAVE NO WORRY ABOUT THE ACCIDENTALS. IN TIME\nYOU WILL FIND THAT YOU ARE SELF-PROVIDED WITH ALL THESE\nACCIDENTAL GIFTS AND POWERS. ON THE OTHER HAND, SO LONG AS YOU\nHAVE NOT GOT THE ROOT, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE SUCH GIFTS\nAND POWERS THROUGH STUDY AND LEARNING.\nA very honest man, saying simply two things: one, turn your lights in; second, don't be concerned with accidentals, non-essentials. As you become an enlightened man, miracles follow you like a shadow. You don't have to do them, they happen around you, in your very air.\nAnd the greatest miracle is that whoever comes in contact with the awakened one tastes for the first time the sweetness of awakening, the grace of awakening, and a longing arises in him which he has never thought about -- to be a buddha himself.\nThe greatest miracle in the world is to bring people to the recognition of their buddhahood.\nOsho - The Miracle 122\nChapter 9 - The simple task of turning in A Zen poet wrote:\nIN THE BOTTOMLESS BAMBOO BASKET I PUT THE WHITE MOON;\nIN THE BOWL OF MINDLESSNESS I STORE THE PURE BREEZE.\nThese are true miracles. They happen on their own in your silences of the heart. Seigensai wrote:\nTHIS GRASPED, ALL IS DUST -- THE SERMON FOR TODAY. LANDS, SEAS.\nAWAKENED, YOU WALK THE EARTH ALONE.\nEverything is dust once you understand yourself. And the moment you understand yourself you find your aloneness so beautiful, so precious, that you don't get lost in the crowd and its stupid ideologies. You become for the first time an individual on your own; you are no more a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Christian. You simply belong to the universe. You are a universal man. This is the greatest miracle.\nAnother Zen poem, by Nensho:\nONLY GENUINE AWAKENING RESULTS IN THAT. ONLY FOOLS SEEK SAINTHOOD FOR REWARD. LIFTING A HAND,\nTHE STONE LANTERN ANNOUNCES DAYBREAK. SMILING, THE VOID NODS ITS ENORMOUS HEAD.\nWhat Nensho is saying is: Why are you trying to be a saint? -- because saints will be rewarded in heaven. All your virtues are just making a way towards paradise, where you will be provided all kinds of pleasures. What are your saints torturing themselves for? Hoping that the more they torture themselves, the closer is paradise. And what does paradise provide?\nNaked young women, rivers of wine, no work; everybody is given a harp ... drink the wine, find a girlfriend, play on the harp, Alleluia! That's all that is happening in paradise.\nAnd I say to you that your saints will look very hilarious. Here they have been torturing themselves, they have become ugly, rotten. And those girlfriends in heaven are plastic, because they have been serving since eternity. I have never heard that anybody goes into retirement. They remain always stuck at the age of sixteen. Time goes on, but they don't grow old -- only plastic can do that. Plastic never grows old, never dies.\nOsho - The Miracle 123\nChapter 9 - The simple task of turning in\nAnd the descriptions in the scriptures make me convinced, because those girls don't perspire. Skin is bound to perspire, that is its very life, it is its breathing. Every pore of the skin is breathing. And there is a reason why it perspires: perspiration keeps your temperature the same so that whether it is cold outside or hot outside, it doesn't matter. Your life is dependent on your temperature. From ninety-six degrees to one hundred and eight -- just twelve degrees is your lifespan. If you go beyond one hundred and eight, you have gone beyond. Perspiration keeps you below that level, because it keeps the heat engaged -- the perspiration becomes evaporated, so the heat becomes engaged in evaporating the perspiration and forgets you completely. It is a miracle.\nWhen it is cold, you start shivering, even your teeth start chattering. Do you know what for? This is all to keep you warm.\nI have heard stories -- I don't believe them -- that people will leave their false teeth in the bathroom, and in the cold those teeth, out of old habit, start chattering. I don't know ... but there are stories on record. Perhaps just an old habit ...\nYour shivering keeps you warm. Otherwise your temperature will fall and that will be again death. Your lifespan is just within those twelve degrees.\nNow those beautiful ladies in paradise never grow old, they always remain\nyoung. I cannot conceive that they have been serving all the saints for millions of years, and still nobody calls them prostitutes! They are the only eternal prostitutes. And these saints are dreaming about them. Here it is prohibited, you cannot drink wine; it is a sin according to many religions. But the same religions provide rivers of wine -- there is no need to drink, you can drown! Here, every religion goes on working on every child: \"Do something; otherwise you will be a hobo.\"\nAnd what are all your saints doing in paradise? -- hobos, playing on their harps. Hippies were simply imitating your saints in paradise, playing their guitars and doing nothing.\nIt is such a boredom to conceive that for millions of years you will be just playing on your harp. There is nothing else to do. You can have as many women as you want, you can drink as much alcohol as you want. Perhaps to make it up- to-date, God may have provided new drugs\n-- LSD, heroin, hashish -- because the saints have earned them by their virtue; this is their reward.\nA genuine search is not for any reward. It is just to know who I am, why I am, what I am.\nIt is a pure search to be acquainted with oneself, because that is the only way to find some connection with the universal spirit.\nNensho has a beautiful metaphor. He says, \"All these saints, what they are doing in declaring their saintliness is like lifting a hand with a stone lantern, announcing daybreak.\"\nBut all over, there is darkness. It is not daybreak. These saints are just stone lanterns, they are not the sunrise.\nAnd the universe smiles at these fools: the void, the immense void, nods its enormous head, smiling.\nOsho - The Miracle 124\nChapter 9 - The simple task of turning in Question 1\nManeesha has asked:\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\nIF YOU WERE TO USE JUST ONE WORD TO DESCRIBE THE ESSENCE OF TRUE\nRELIGIOUSNESS, ONE WORD THAT IS THE KEY TO BEING ABLE TO DROP\nWHATEVER HAS BEEN AND SIMPLY LIVE ONE MOMENT AT A TIME -- WHAT\nWOULD THAT ONE WORD BE?\nManeesha, that one word is in. Just in.\nGo in and all the mysteries open before you.\nBut before you go in ... because nobody knows whether you will return or not. It is a miracle that everybody returns every day. What more miracles do you want? Jesus raised only one man from death. I have to do double the work! First I have to tell you to die -- ten thousand sannyasins die every night -- and then the great work has to be done to bring you back to life. And the miracle is, you all come back! Not a single one is left behind.\nSo before that inward journey -- the dangerous journey, as one may not like to come back\n-- a few laughs are necessary. So on your inner journey you go laughing ... at least smiling.\nWhen pretty Angela Carrotti goes out on her first date, her parents tell her to be home by nine o'clock.\nShe gets in at nine-fifteen with her hair messed up and her make-up smeared.\nMomma Carrotti asks her how the evening was.

MEDITATION AND WISDOM ARE ALSO LIKE THIS.\nManeesha, the understanding of mind ultimately ends in the understanding of meditation.\nThe function of the mind is to divide things. Duality is its territory: darkness and light, life and death. The mind cannot conceive anything which has not its\nopposite.\nBut existence is not obliged to function according to the mind. In existence day and night merge into each other, every evening, every morning. They are not separate. Neither are life and death separate. If they were separate it would be possible for someone to go on living, and not to allow death to enter into his house.\nOsho - The Miracle 129\nChapter 10 - Sun and moon in one's sleeve\nAn ancient Chinese story will help you to understand the great Zen master Eno. His every statement is a scripture in itself.\nThe ancient story is that a great emperor, being afraid of death, created a palace with a single door. No other doors, no other windows, no way of entering into the palace except from one small door where he had placed a complete row of guards. Guard number one was to be guarded by number two, and guard number two was guarded by number three, and guard number three was guarded by number four ... seven guards watching each other! More protection is not possible.\nA neighboring king heard about it, and he wanted to see this most secure palace. He was welcomed. The owner of the palace took him in, showed him all the facilities inside, that there was no way for any enemy, for any thief, for any killer to enter.\nThe king was very much impressed. He said, \"I will immediately order the same. Just give me the names of the architects, to make the same palace for me in my kingdom.\"\nTalking with each other, they came out to where the chariot of the king was waiting. And when he said, \"I'm going to make exactly the same palace. I loved it, the very idea. It is so safe and secure ...\" a beggar by the side of the road started laughing madly.\nBoth were stunned. For a moment there was silence.\nThey both asked the beggar, \"Why are you laughing?\"\nHe said, \"I'm laughing because there is a loophole in all this, and I know the loophole. I have been sitting in this place for years, begging, so I have been watching the building of the palace.\"\nThe emperor asked, \"What is the loophole?\" He said, \"That one door!\"\nThe emperor laughed. He said, \"I have placed seven guards on it. They are guarding on each other, nobody can betray. What is the fear?\"\nThe beggar said, \"With due respect, I want to tell you that death will enter and your guards will not be able to see it. And death is the only insecurity. What else? Do you have any protection against death?\"\nThe emperor was at a loss.\nThe beggar said, \"My suggestion is that if you want really to be secure, tell your builders to raise a wall in place of that door! I still cannot guarantee that death will not enter -- but at least you have made as much effort as possible; close the door and be inside.\"\nThe emperor said, \"But that means I'm already dead! It becomes a grave, not a palace, if I cannot come out.\"\nThe beggar said, \"If you think just by closing one door your life will be finished, don't you think that by closing other doors, parts of your life are finished? By closing the windows, other parts of your life are finished? You are going to live at the minimum, while the maximum was available.\"\nBoth the kings were surprised to see the intelligence of the beggar. They came close to him and they asked him, \"From where have you come?\"\nOsho - The Miracle 130\nChapter 10 - Sun and moon in one's sleeve\nHe said, \"You will not understand. Your fathers were my friends. Once I also used to be an emperor. But seeing the whole unnecessary trouble, I made myself completely secure -- I dropped all walls, all worries, opened all windows. Now for almost half a century nobody has harmed me. I'm just a beggar -- why should anyone harm me? I have nothing to be stolen. I sleep as I have never slept before.\"\nIf you really want to be living at the maximum, don't listen to the duality of the mind.\nThe only security in existence is going beyond the mind.\nThe beggar was a great Taoist master. His name was Lieh Tzu. But people had forgotten that fifty years before he had dropped his kingdom.\nHe said, \"The only security I have found is in being silent, in being myself, where all duality disappears. Where you and the universe are one, then death cannot do anything.\"\nYou have disappeared on your own accord; now there is no way to harm you. There is nobody to harm you. The body is not you, the mind is not you. You are just a guest in a house.\nDon't get identified with the house, just remember the guest. This statement of Eno is tremendously beautiful:\nGOOD FRIENDS, MY TEACHING OF THE DHARMA TAKES MEDITATION AND\nWISDOM AS ITS BASIS. NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SAY\nMISTAKENLY THAT MEDITATION AND WISDOM ARE DIFFERENT; THEY ARE A UNITY, NOT TWO THINGS.\nBut all the so-called intelligent people of the world have taken them as two things.\nMeditation is for the mystics and wisdom comes from accumulating knowledge from the scriptures, from the old traditions. They have degraded wisdom to\nknowledge -- borrowed knowledge.\nEno is saying that wisdom is the fragrance of meditation; they are not separable. You cannot have wisdom without meditation and you cannot have meditation without wisdom. In fact, they are two names for one phenomenon.\nTo be yourself, silently and fully aware, is to know without any doubt that meditation and wisdom are one.\nMeditation is the source and wisdom is the radiation. Meditation is your understanding and wisdom is your action according to that understanding. Meditation is your inner experience and wisdom is its outer expression.\nA man of meditation cannot do anything wrong. And a man of so-called wisdom alone is just a parrot. He goes on repeating, but his heart is not touched by his own repetitions.\nA priest had two parrots. They were very good, saintly, with their rosaries in their hands, repeating Ave Maria. But once in a while they would become very sad, both of them at the same time. So he thought perhaps they needed a companion.\nHe went to the pet shop, thinking certainly they need a companion, because both are male; they need a female at least to share with. So he bought a female, and as he put the female Osho - The Miracle\n131\nChapter 10 - Sun and moon in one's sleeve\nparrot into their cage, one parrot said to the other, \"Johnny, now drop the rosary! There is no need of it, our prayers have been heard!\"\nThe priest could not believe that these idiots had been praying for their own reasons, not for the Christian religion. They both dropped their rosaries.\nA man who thinks that through borrowed knowledge he is wise, is not only befooling himself but others also. His wisdom is just a memory, not a knowing, because knowing blossoms only through meditation.\nEno says:\nNEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SAY MISTAKENLY THAT\nMEDITATION AND WISDOM ARE DIFFERENT; THEY ARE A UNITY, NOT TWO\nTHINGS. MEDITATION ITSELF IS THE SUBSTANCE OF WISDOM; WISDOM ITSELF\nIS THE FUNCTION OF MEDITATION.

ENO ADDED:\nGOOD FRIENDS, HOW THEN ARE MEDITATION AND WISDOM ALIKE? THEY\nARE LIKE THE LAMP AND THE LIGHT IT GIVES FORTH. IF THERE IS A LAMP\nTHERE IS LIGHT; IF THERE IS NO LAMP THERE IS NO LIGHT. THE LAMP IS THE\nSUBSTANCE OF LIGHT; THE LIGHT IS THE FUNCTION OF THE LAMP. THUS, ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE TWO NAMES, IN SUBSTANCE THEY ARE NOT TWO.\nMEDITATION AND WISDOM ARE ALSO LIKE THIS.\nEno is making a significant statement. You are standing on a road -- inwards is the realm of meditation. And if you reach to the point where you touch your very being, then outwardly you can express your meditation in everything that you do. All your gestures, all your actions, even your silences -- not doing anything, just sitting -- will also express the radiance, the fragrance, the beauty, the joy of meditation. This is wisdom.\nBut people have been misled by parents, by teachers, by priests, by everyone, to accumulate wisdom. You can accumulate great wisdom and yet you will be just a learned Osho - The Miracle\n132\nChapter 10 - Sun and moon in one's sleeve\nidiot. Your behavior will show it, your actions will show it; just your words will be in consonance with the scriptures.\nThe authentic wisdom does not come from outside. The authentic wisdom comes when you have gone deeper into your being and found the center of your life -- then suddenly an explosion. Everything that you do or don't do expresses your wisdom.\nWisdom is just the fragrance of a rose. Find the rose first and the fragrance will be found on its own accord. Don't even make the distinction of which comes first, because they are not two. They are one, looked at from two sides -- one from inside and one from outside.\nWhatever is your enlightenment expresses itself inside as meditation, and outside as wisdom.\nNeither comes first, they are one. The outer and the inner both are together.\nBut mind always creates distinctions, separations. And it is because of the mind that you get into unnecessary troubles: philosophic conflicts, theological arguments. You waste your time on books looking for something that may help you to find yourself.\nYou cannot find, anywhere, anything that will help you to find yourself. You have to be clear about it: you are not to be found, you are already here. You have just to recognize the fact.\nA master does not teach you to be yourself; he simply makes you recognize what is hidden behind your heartbeat. In his presence a certain synchronicity happens. You simply be close to a master, silently, and you start feeling a rush of energy flowing towards you, making you afire. It is invisible to the spectators; only the participants are the blessed ones.\nOnce you know yourself, you are in meditation and your actions will show wisdom.\nA Zen poet wrote:\nTO HAVE THE SUN AND MOON IN ONE'S SLEEVE;\nTO HOLD THE UNIVERSE\nIN THE PALM OF ONE'S HAND.\nAnd his haiku is complete. Just remember one hand, just remember one sleeve. TO HAVE THE SUN AND MOON IN ONE'S SLEEVE,\nTO HOLD THE UNIVERSE\nIN THE PALM OF ONE'S HAND.\nWhen you open your hand, don't you have the whole universe in your palm? Just don't close it. The closed hand is the poorest; it has nothing in it.\nIt is a strange thing, that every child is born with a closed hand, and everybody dies with an open hand. It has never been heard of that anybody has died with a closed hand, because to close the hand you need energy. The open hand needs no energy, no tension. A closed hand will get tired. The dying man cannot afford the energy to close his fist.\nBut it is beautiful to go deeper into the question of why every child is born with closed hands. It signifies that every child is born with great hopes and expectations and desires.\nThose closed hands are showing that he has to make something of himself -- to be successful, Osho - The Miracle\n133\nChapter 10 - Sun and moon in one's sleeve\nrich, politically powerful. It is an unconscious, very deep-rooted expression of his being. He comes into the world with great secrets; soon he will start getting frustrated. No success succeeds.\nIn fact, every success ends up in failure, in a deep frustration, because what you wanted is not found.\nThe old man dying has nothing to hold on to. No desire, no expectation ... he\nmoves into death just like a beggar.\nWhen Alexander the Great died, he told his ministers, \"Keep my hands hanging outside of the coffin.\"\nThey said, \"Strange idea!\" It had never been heard of. Nobody had done it. A dead man should behave and keep his hands inside the coffin.\nBut Alexander said, \"It is my order and it has to be fulfilled! It is my last wish. It does not matter that nobody else has done it; it's going to be done to me. Keep my hands hanging outside the casket!\"\nThey said, \"But why this idea?\"\nAlexander said, \"Millions of people will come to see. I want to make it clear to them that I had come into the world with closed fists, with great expectations, with great secret desires -- I am going from the world utterly frustrated, with open hands. I'm not taking anything with me.\nAll that I had has proved to be just a delusion.\"\nMeditation makes you an open hand. Mind is very secretive; mind goes on keeping your desires, your angers, your frustrations, your miseries, all secret -- a closed fist. Meditation is an opening of the fist. And then the whole universe is in your hands. A small haiku with a great meaning ...\nIkkyu wrote:\nSHOULD YOU SEEK\nTHE WAY OF THE BUDDHA ALL NIGHT LONG, SEARCHING, YOU WILL ENTER INTO YOUR OWN MIND.\nYou can go on searching not only the whole night but the whole life of unconsciousness and darkness, searching for Buddha. You will always end up\nwith your mind.\nYou will not find the buddha because the buddha is not to be found by searching. The buddha has to be simply recognized. Without making any effort to seek and search, just look in. You are the buddha.\nAnd immediately all your actions, all your ways of life, all your functions, will change --\nimmediately. They will all carry the fragrance of a buddha. Osho - The Miracle\n134\nChapter 10 - Sun and moon in one's sleeve Another haiku:\nHOWEVER MUCH WE POUR IN, NEVER TO BRIM OVER;\nTO LADLE OUT, NEVER EXHAUSTING; MOREOVER, NOT TO KNOW THE REASON FOR IT -- THIS IS CALLED THE HIDDEN LIGHT.\nThe light within you is perfect. You cannot take anything out of it, nor can you add anything to it. It is a perfect circle, it is a perfectly opened lotus. You cannot do anything to it; you can only rejoice. You can dance, you can sing a song, in praise of the lotus that has blossomed within your being.\nParticularly, I want my people to know that meditation is not just being silent -- that is only one part of it. Finally, it has to be creative. And when a poetry comes out of your inner silences, or a painting, it has a flavor which is not of this world.\nQuestion 1 Maneesha has asked:\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\nWHEN YOU SAY EACH EVENING DURING THE MEDITATION, \"GO IN, GO\nDEEPER AND DEEPER LIKE AN ARROW TO YOUR CENTER,\" IS IT THAT THERE IS\nACTUALLY NOWHERE TO GO AND NOTHING TO DO BECAUSE WE ARE\nALREADY IN?\nIS ALL WE CAN DO JUST BE AWARE OF HOW AND WHEN WE PERPETUALLY\nGO OUT, FURTHER AND FURTHER FROM OURSELVES?\nYes, Maneesha. There is nowhere to go. You are already there, where you needed to be.\nAnd once you recognize it, then you carry your consciousness wherever you go. Then time makes no difference, nor does space.

MASTER,</p><p>YUN-MEN SAID:</p><p>MY DUTY COMPELS ME TO ATTEMPT THE IMPOSSIBLE.

THREAD OF SILK. EVEN THIS TALK IS BUT A DECORATION ON THE</p><p>DOOR OF OUR HOUSE. THE IMPORTANT THING IS YOUR EXPERIENTIAL</p><p>REALIZATION OF THIS STATE.</p><p>Maneesha, before I discuss the great matter of Zen, Avirbhava has
brought a few ancient gods to be inaugurated into her Museum of Gods.
Her assistant, Anando, has also brought a few small gods. Before I tell
them to show you what they have brought ...</p><p>The research on the subject of the rat as an object of worship ...
The rat is a very ancient god, but still prevalent, not dead. The
research was done by the appropriate person, Sardar Gurudayal Singh.</p><p>"The rat is the charioteer of the elephant god, Ganesh. According to
myth it is worshipped all over India, and especially in Maharashtra.</p><p>Rats are said to consume more grain than all the people of India.
They are one of the causes of India's poverty, and their growth rate is
far greater than that of the Indian people.</p><p>During Indira Gandhi's rule there were suggestions brought to
parliament about how to tackle this problem. Immediately, opposition
leaders from Morarji Desai's party argued that a poisoning of rats was
out of the question because that would hurt the religious feelings of
Osho - The Miracle</p><p>102</p><p>Chapter 8 - Joy in the morning</p><p>Maharashtran people. The only solution to this menace of rats
destroying the grainstocks that was considered was to make the rats
aware of birth control. But how to get this message to the rats? The
opposition claimed that they had done their duty by suggesting this
great solution; the implementing of birth control upon the rats would be
the ruling party's affair. That was the end of the debate."</p><p>Since that time Morarji Desai himself has been a prime minister and
again the question was brought up. Now he was in a difficult situation.
As a Gandhian he is against birth control.</p><p>Instead of birth control, celibacy is the solution. In the first
place he should have considered that teaching rats birth control is
going against Gandhian philosophy. They should be taught how to be
celibate.</p><p>Secondly, when he was in opposition he had himself proposed that
birth control was the only solution. They cannot be killed, even though
because of them the whole of India is suffering from poverty. Now that
he was in the ruling party, the prime minister, he could not go against
his word. He was in a difficult situation. And by this time the rats had
grown far bigger and far more numerous than at the time of Indira.</p><p>Right now they are eating three times more than the Indian
population. Soon they will starve the whole population, but the
politician cowards will not take any step. Morarji put it aside into the
file, saying that an investigation should be made of how to introduce
birth control to the rats. This is the way of the cunning politicians --
always create an investigation committee which does great work in two,
three years; then take their report and file it away.</p><p>By that time most probably the prime minister is gone, and the new
prime minister has no obligation to be bothered with any report that had
been asked for by the previous one.</p><p>It is strange that people can see human beings dying, but they cannot
hurt their stupid feelings, which they call religious feelings. The
whole idea is so stupid!</p><p>The elephant god Ganesh is a myth. The story is that Shiva's wife was
taking a bath. It seems she must have been taking a bath for the first
time in her life, because so much dust and rust came off her body. In
the bathroom she became playful, and made a statue from that rust and
dust. And because she is a goddess, she was able to breathe life into
the statue. That is how Ganesh was born.</p><p>And she told Ganesh, "I am taking a bath, so you sit down outside on
the steps. Your father is out, don't allow anybody in." But he had no
idea of the father ... Who is the father? In fact nobody has any idea
who the father is. It is not only Ganesh; everybody simply believes, and
often their belief is not the case.</p><p>Shiva came, and Shiva is a very angry god ... Ganesh stopped him,
saying, "My mother is taking a bath."</p><p>Shiva said, "Your mother? I have been gone. How have you been born?"
In a rage he cut off the head of Ganesh, and threw the head into the
valley -- they lived in the Himalayas. He entered the house and asked
his wife, "What is the matter? Who was this fellow sitting outside. I
cut off his head and threw the head into the valley."</p><p>His wife was very angry. She told the whole story of how she had made
him. He said, "My God, I have killed my own son!"</p><p>He went in search, but how to find where that head had gone? He just
found a small elephant, so he cut off the head of the elephant and put
it on top of the child's body. Being a supreme God, he managed to glue
them together perfectly. But because the child was small Osho - The
Miracle</p><p>103</p><p>Chapter 8 - Joy in the morning</p><p>and the head was too heavy, the child needed some kind of horse or
vehicle to carry him, he could not walk with all that weight. And these
stupid ideas have prevailed with millions of people.</p><p>So Shiva looked around and found a rat, and Ganesh rides on the rat.
Such a poor fellow, the rat is carrying such a load ... And he is loved
and worshipped all over India, most particularly in Maharashtra. Morarji
Desai should consult Shiva about how he managed to teach the rat to
carry Ganesh.</p><p>So nobody can say that it is a simple matter, "just kill those rats."
Anybody who says that most probably will be killed. Particularly no
politician is going to take the risk, because then who is going to vote
for him? Being against the rat, no politician can win. And the rat has
been doing so much harm that just ten years more and he will finish
everything and leave this country a graveyard. But still the politicians
will not take any step.</p><p>More about rats: "The rat has been used as a symbol of the cosmos.
The head, neck, and body signify the upper planes of atma, which means
self; buddhi, which means intelligence; and higher manas, the awareness,
consciousness. Each leg of the rat represents a different plane: the
lower manas, the lower mind, the astral mind, the ethereal mind, and
other physical aspects."</p><p>These idiots who go on making such metaphors and symbols should be
imprisoned and punished, but they are worshipped and respected as great
scholars.</p><p>"The Dakotan explanation for why the moon wanes is that it is eaten
by a multitude of rats.</p><p>In Germanic belief, the soul assumes the form of a rat or mouse, and
in this form may come forth from a sleeper's mouth."</p><p>So beware! Never allow your mouth to open in your sleep. The rat may
escape.</p><p>I have heard a story that Nancy Reagan phoned her doctor, "Come
quickly! A rat has entered into snoring Ronald's mouth!"</p><p>The doctor said, "I am coming, but it will take a few minutes.
Meanwhile you do one thing, hold a small piece of cheese over his mouth.
Perhaps the rat may come back out."</p><p>When the doctor arrived after ten minutes, he could not believe his
eyes. Nancy was waving a cat over Ronald's face. He said, "My God, this
way the rat will go even deeper! I told you to hold a piece of
cheese!"</p><p>She said, "I did, but the rat pulled the cheese in! Now I am holding
the cat to pull the rat and the cheese both out. Now that you have come,
I can relax, you do the work!"</p><p>But this really was a religious belief in Germany.</p><p>Obviously the soul must enter from somewhere and must get out from
somewhere; some door is needed, and the mouth seems to be the right
place for it. If you are sleeping with somebody else, then it is even
more dangerous -- somebody else's rat may enter your mouth.</p><p>Always keep your mouth shut, for safety and security. Neither allow
the inner one to go out, nor allow an outside one to come in!</p><p>"The name of the rat is taboo in some parts of Europe. In Bohemia a
white mouse should not be killed, it should be taken out of the trap and
fed. Otherwise luck will desert the house Osho - The Miracle</p><p>104</p><p>Chapter 8 - Joy in the morning</p><p>and other rats will increase in number. Sometimes spells are used to
keep down the number of rats.</p><p>Elsewhere four pairs of rats are married and set adrift -- with the
idea that this will cause the other rats to go away."</p><p>When they see that the others are going on their honeymoon ... just
get your own boat and go on a honeymoon too. Why are you wasting your
life unnecessarily in those dark holes, when others are enjoying the
fresh air on the river? The idea seems to be good.</p><p>"Rats are an omen of death in Austria. In other places they are a
good omen.</p><p>In Zoroastrianism the rat is an evil animal, and the killing of one
rat equals in merit the slaying of four lions."</p><p>So don't be worried -- if you are a rat, you are equal to four lions.
If your wife calls you a rat, she is saying, "You are equal to four
lions."</p><p>"In Jewish folklore, eating anything gnawed by a rat causes loss of
memory. Thus cats, which eat rats, don't remember their masters."</p><p>Rats destroy the memory system; that's why cats go on forgetting who
is their master.</p><p>Dogs never eat rats so they always remember their master.</p><p>And simultaneously Anando is also contributing something to
Avirbhava's Museum of Gods, the monkey.</p><p>The monkey has also been a problem in India. You cannot shoot a
monkey -- a monkey can shoot you, there is no constitutional law against
that.</p><p>In the capital of North India, Lucknow, there is a very beautiful
temple of the monkey-god Hanuman. Surrounded by great trees, it is a
very ancient temple, and hundreds of monkeys live on those trees. People
go with food, flowers, sweets, and those monkeys ... of course Hanuman
is just a stone monkey, but the real monkeys are all around and they are
flourishing, becoming stronger.</p><p>Something happened suddenly in 1955. Nobody knows the actual cause,
but the monkeys became violent at the sight of any kind of uniform. So
the policeman, the postman, the military man, the sannyasin ... none of
them could pass down that street. Those monkeys would jump on them and
hit them hard, tear away</p><p>their clothes and they would have to run naked, oozing blood, down a
main street in Lucknow. And the assembly of Lucknow could not decide
what to do.</p><p>It is something strange that both monkeys and dogs are against
uniforms -- both seem to be very revolutionary. Uniformed people are
very orthodox, all just imitating each other. Dogs immediately start
barking when they see the postman or the policeman or the sannyasin;
anybody who wears a uniform provokes dogs and monkeys to fight against
this traditionalism.</p><p>It used to be that monkeys only made faces and threatened from the
trees. But in Lucknow</p><p>-- perhaps somebody had hurt them, nobody knows the cause -- for
fifteen days they made such a chaos that the whole market had to be
closed. And the government could not decide to shoot those monkeys,
because if they were shot the whole Hindu population's religious heart
would be hurt. But since nobody came on that road anymore, those monkeys
came to their senses -- because now no more food was available. So
finally they decided not to harm people Osho - The Miracle</p><p>105</p><p>Chapter 8 - Joy in the morning</p><p>any longer. They could see the point -- if nobody passes on the road,
nobody comes to the temple, they don't get any food or flowers.
Otherwise they were the blessed monkeys, very rich.</p><p>Seeing the situation, after fifteen days they had to surrender.
Slowly, slowly people started opening their shops again, moving on the
street, cautiously at first. And the government had alerted the people
that nobody should shoot a monkey. Rather than calling the army to shoot
the monkeys, they ordered people, "If you shoot a monkey you will be
thought a criminal, and you will be treated just as if you have shot a
man. No distinction will be made!"</p><p>These poor politicians are ruling all over the world, and they are
ruled by all kinds of superstitions and stupidities.</p><p>"Zoolatry, or the worship of animals, is not uncommon in the East.
The monkey is among those animals worshipped, like the tiger and the
snake, out of fear.</p><p>It is said that the monkey is a symbol of the lower mind which
imitates or reflects the higher, or represents the automatic mind. The
monkey god, Hanuman, son of Vayu, the god of winds, is worshipped today
in India. He is a symbol of the intellect which comes from the higher
mind, Vayu.</p><p>And in the orthodox villages in India the monkey is always free from
harm and is magic.</p><p>Its magic influence is implored against the whirlwind, and it is also
invoked to avert sterility.</p><p>The bones of monkeys are said to pollute the ground. Mentioning a
monkey brings starvation for the rest of the day, but it is regarded as
lucky to keep one in the stable.</p><p>It is seriously believed in Africa and South America that monkeys can
talk, but do not for fear of being made to work."</p><p>That is really good ... if they talk there is every danger man will
force them to work. It is better to keep quiet.</p><p>I have heard about a small child who would not talk. He was taken to
this psychologist, to that psychiatrist, to a psychoanalyst ... nobody
could get him to utter a single word. He could hear perfectly well; he
was checked, his ears were perfect. But he would not show even a sign
from his eyes or face that he had heard anything.</p><p>But one day at the dining table he said to his mother, "Where's the
salt?" The mother said, "My God, you have never spoken before."</p><p>He said, "Nothing was ever missing before, why should I have spoken?
I heard all those psychoanalysts and psychiatrists and all the nonsense
they were talking. But to speak means going to school, and I hate
school. It's just because of the salt that I had to speak now, in spite
of myself. But this is just between me and you, don't tell anybody. I am
never going to speak again, so nobody would believe you anyway."</p><p>There was not a witness, either. The mother was at a loss. She told
her husband, but the husband said, "It is not possible, six years
silence and suddenly ... You</p><p>will have to give me proof. Make him speak again."</p><p>But he would not speak, he had made the point clear that speaking
meant going to school.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 106</p><p>Chapter 8 - Joy in the morning</p><p>This idea in South America and South Africa -- both faraway places --
is that monkeys understand your language, but they will not speak just
out of fear that they would be forced to work.</p><p>"Another story suggests that apes carry off women to the woods. In
many places respect for the monkey is based on the belief that it is the
abode of the human spirit.</p><p>Among the Hottentots, the killer of a baboon has to sacrifice a sheep
or goat and hang the lowest vertebrae around his neck, or he will suffer
from lumbago. In China the monkey is regarded as lucky in that it keeps
sickness away, while in Java an offering made to the king of the monkeys
is believed to cure sterility."</p><p>Now, Avirbhava, bring your rat, and Anando, your monkeys.</p><p>(AVIRBHAVA PUTS A BIG, BLACK TOY RAT AT THE MASTER'S FEET. IT</p><p>STARTS DANCING AND MAKING COMICAL SOUNDS. SHE ALSO PUTS A CLOCKWORK
MONKEY ON THE PODIUM WHICH WANDERS AROUND THE</p><p>MASTER'S FEET. ANANDO SITS A SMALL RUBBER MONKEY ON THE</p><p>PODIUM.) Very meditative monkey! Well, where are your small
monkeys?</p><p>(MANY LITTLE MONKEYS ARE PUT ON THE PODIUM. MEANWHILE AVIRBHAVA'S
MONKEY IS RUNNING AWAY AND AVIRBHAVA HAS TO</p><p>JUMP TO</p><p>CATCH IT. EVERYBODY IS LAUGHING.)</p><p>Just give a good clap, too.</p><p>Now, remove your gods. Just ask all the sannyasins around the world
to find out about all the animals that have been worshipped by human
beings -- to show to everyone what kind of past we have had. And there
are still people who are worshipping animals.</p><p>Religion has been reduced to such nonsense. And the harm is that
people become involved in these absolutely absurd ideas and forget
completely about themselves. The only religion is the religion of being
conscious. All other religions are simply toys for children.</p><p>But we go on living unconsciously, without seeing what people are
doing. They celebrate monkeys, elephants, they worship even rats. This
is such an undignified state of affairs that it has to be changed
completely.</p><p>So Avirbhava's Museum of Gods will be immensely significant for
visitors -- to show them, "This is your past, this is your religion, and
this is still your present. You cannot simply say that it is past. And
do you want to realize yourself through rats?"</p><p>This museum will provide a great insight to anybody who comes here
without any prejudice. But it will bring many law cases against me,
although we are not harming their gods -- they will be taken care of --
we are just putting them in a museum, where all your scriptures and all
your ideologies also belong.</p><p>We want a complete break from the past so that man can have his wings
to fly into the sky of consciousness, absolutely free. That is the
revolution of Zen.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 107</p><p>Chapter 8 - Joy in the morning YUN-MEN SAID:</p><p>MY DUTY COMPELS ME TO ATTEMPT THE IMPOSSIBLE. EVEN IN TELLING</p><p>YOU TO LOOK DIRECTLY INTO YOURSELF AND TO BE UNCONCERNED ABOUT</p><p>OTHER THINGS, I AM ALREADY BURYING THE REAL THING UNDER VERBIAGE.</p><p>This is the way the authentic master speaks, even knowing perfectly
well that he is doing something wrong. Speaking about the truth is not
right, but it is absolutely necessary to give some indication. Words are

miraculous, the buddha, lives.</p><p>It cannot be burned. Your consciousness cannot be burned or destroyed
by any other means. It is indestructible. He is not referring to your
body. Your body may be burned, you cannot pass through fire; you may be
drowned in water. He is referring to your innermost being -- of which
you are unaware -- which is the source of your life.</p><p>In meditation you have to find that space, that clear sky, and then a
metamorphosis, a revolution, happens on its own accord. You start
changing without any effort because of the new clarity, the new light,
the new experience, the new acquaintance with yourself. The whole
existence becomes new.</p><p>A man who knows himself cannot worship rats, a man who knows himself
cannot worship monkeys or elephants, a man who knows himself cannot
worship at all! -- because worship is outward. He cannot pray at all,
because all prayers are addressed to somebody else. He can only
meditate, he can only be silently drowned in his own splendor -- which
is not his own.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 108</p><p>Chapter 8 - Joy in the morning</p><p>Slowly, slowly as meditation deepens he becomes aware that it is the
splendor of our whole universe.</p><p>We are not only parts, we are one with the whole. The whole expresses
itself in many ways, then everything becomes divine; the very earth you
are sitting on becomes divine, and whatever you are doing becomes
divine. But first you have to find the divine element within yourself.
It is not a belief system; it is an inquiry, it is as scientific an
investigation as any science can claim.</p><p>In fact no science is as scientific as meditation, because all
sciences deny the existence of the scientist. They are experimenting
with things, but they don't want to say anything about who is working
inside them, about what it is. On that point they remain absolutely
silent because it cannot be made objective, it cannot be put on their
table so they can dissect it and find all the elements in it; it is
non-material.</p><p>Hence the scientist is bound to remain with the superstition that the
world is only objective, that the world has only the outside. Can you
see the irrationality in it? The outside can exist only if there is an
inside. If you deny the inside you cannot accept the outside, they both
come together. The mystic is more scientific in the way he accepts the
beauty of the world, the universe, and the way he accepts the beauty and
splendor of his own being.</p><p>Ryokan wrote:</p><p>IF YOU SPEAK DELUSIONS, EVERYTHING BECOMES A DELUSION:</p><p>IF YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH, EVERYTHING BECOMES THE TRUTH.</p><p>OUTSIDE THE TRUTH THERE IS NO DELUSION, BUT OUTSIDE DELUSION THERE IS

judgmental, more experimental. It also means that when you are all so
deeply involved, I don't have to look at my watch. When I see somebody

looked at my watch.</p><p>I haven't looked at it for years.</p><p>Sometimes it doesn't show the time at all, there is nothing to look

say good-bye to the world, because I don't know for certain that
tomorrow morning I will wake up. When I wake up I am amazed that there
is one more day, one more celebration, one more day to laugh with my

ON THE OTHER HAND, SO LONG AS YOU</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 114</p><p>Chapter 9 - The simple task of turning in</p><p>HAVE NOT GOT AT THE ROOT, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE SUCH</p><p>GIFTS AND POWERS THROUGH STUDY AND LEARNING.</p><p>Maneesha, basically there is only one way of discovering the buddha,
the truth of your very being. But there are thousands of people with
different states of consciousness; hence for them, different devices,
different small streets joining to the main way, have to be created.</p><p>That's what all the Zen masters in the fourteen-hundred-year history
of Zen have been trying very diligently to do.</p><p>No one is being left out; everybody is shown a way that may fit them.
But finally, whatever fits you will lead you to the ultimate way:
turning in. Every device is dedicated to the simple task of turning
in.</p><p>As the situation is, man is born with five senses which all go
outwards. Nature has not given you a special sense that goes
inwards.</p><p>Your eyes open outwards; if you close them there is only darkness. Or
even with closed eyes you will still see things of the outside world as
imagination, as dreams. Ears can hear only the music that comes from the
outside; they know nothing about the music that is continuously
happening within you. Nobody is born with an ear to hear the inner
music. Your hands stretch outside. Even the smallest child starts
grabbing outside things.</p><p>Obviously this state of affairs, that all our senses open outwards,
has been exploited. We have been given every kind of theology, religion,
truth, from the outside, because that is what we are demanding. We want
a God to be there above in the sky. We want anything and immediately
there will be a supplier.</p><p>You just have to ask and somebody will create a system of beliefs to
satisfy you.</p><p>Zen cuts all this rubbish like a sharp sword in one single blow. It
has nothing to do with anything that takes you away from you; it may be
God, it may be hell, it may be heaven -- all kinds of rewards and all
kinds of fears about punishment. All the religions are living on the
exploitation of your senses because they open outwards.</p><p>The work of a real master is to close all these doors so that your
life energy, your consciousness, does not leak out. There is no
naturally given way to go inwards, but it is not needed. If enough
consciousness is gathered in, it will create its own way, just as water
creates its own way -- no map, no guidelines, just enough quantity and
the water will start flowing towards an unknown sea. It has never heard
about, knows nothing about, where it is going.</p><p>The same is true about consciousness. Enough consciousness gathered
inside immediately makes a way upon which nobody has ever trodden, and
starts moving inwards. Outward senses are closed; that's what I mean
when I say in your meditations to close your eyes, to leave the body
completely behind ... because all the senses are joined with the body.
Just be a watcher of the mind, so the mind cannot take your energy
outside. With body and mind both closed energy gathers upon itself
spontaneously, and at a certain point it starts moving inwards. You
don't have to do anything except to close all the doors that lead you
away from yourself.</p><p>It is one of the simplest things because you don't have to do it. But
just because of its simplicity, its obviousness, it has become difficult
-- the most difficult, because nobody can teach you; nobody can indicate
to you where to move, how to move. The master can only create a
situation in which the spontaneous movement of the energy will
happen.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 115</p><p>Chapter 9 - The simple task of turning in</p><p>That's what I call meditation. It is not your doing. You have to stop
doing everything. It is your non-doing.</p><p>And the moment when you are not doing, all your energy that was
involved in doing a thousand and one things is released. It gathers to a
point where it starts flowing inwards, and the innermost center is not
far away.</p><p>Meditation is, in a way, going beyond nature. Hence it is called
transcendental. Nature has not provided any automatic way, like it has
provided eyes, hands, ears; it has not provided any way for your energy
to go in. Meditation is transcending the natural gifts, moving beyond
nature. It is not against nature, it is simply towards a greater nature,
more overwhelming, more universal.</p><p>And once you have found the way and you have touched your own being,
you have gone through a magic. You will never be the same person again.
Not only that, the world that surrounds you will never be the same
again. Now your love will have a new fragrance -- not the old
possessiveness, domination. Your friendship will be more friendliness
than friendship.</p><p>It will not have any bondage, any conditionings. Your vision of the
world will become immensely intense and sharp. You will see things which
have been there always, present, but you were not present.</p><p>Each flower is showing something of the divine. Each star is shining,
showing something of the divine. The whole existence in its multitude of
expressions is showing only the divine, but you will recognize it only
on the condition that you have recognized it within yourself.</p><p>Then you know that your center is not only your center, it is the
center of the whole universe.</p><p>We are all joined in this center.</p><p>It is said about Bacon -- a great scientific thinker, perhaps the
most important, because he turned the whole human mind from religion to
science ... He used to say, "If I can find the center of the world I can
move the world according to me." But he never found the center of the
world, and I say unto you he has never heard that in the East we have
been searching not the center of the world but the center of ourselves.
Finding the center of ourselves we have found the center of the
universe. But then the desire for change drops. The universe is so
beautiful, nothing needs to be changed; everything has to be rejoiced
and celebrated.</p><p>These statements of a great master Ejaku are very fundamental.</p><p>EJAKU SAID:</p><p>LET EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU TURN THE LIGHT INWARDS UPON</p><p>HIMSELF, AND NOT TRY TO MEMORIZE MY WORDS.</p><p>Only a very great master can say that -- don't bother about my words,
because they don't contain the truth. No words can contain it, so don't
memorize them. I am saying to you, "Turn in." But you can do two things:
you can memorize the words "turn in" or you can do another thing ...
existentially, you can turn in. That's what Ejaku is saying: "I am not
saying these words to you so that you can memorize my words."</p><p>SINCE TIME WITHOUT BEGINNING, YOU HAVE TURNED YOUR BACK UPON</p><p>THE LIGHT AND RUN AFTER DARKNESS. THE HABITS OF ERRONEOUS</p><p>THINKING ARE SO DEEP-ROOTED IN YOU THAT IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY</p><p>DIFFICULT TO UPROOT THEM OVERNIGHT.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 116</p><p>Chapter 9 - The simple task of turning in</p><p>It is obviously true, but with great respect to Ejaku I disagree.</p><p>However many lives you may have been wandering outside, it does not
matter. You can come to yourself in a single moment. It is just like a
man asleep. He may be anywhere in the world, visiting Moscow or Peking
or Tokyo or going to the moon -- just wake him up. Do you think he will
say, "Wait, I have to catch a train to come back from Tokyo?" Or, "From
Moscow I have to take a plane; I cannot just wake up immediately." He
does not say that, he simply wakes up and wonders ... instantaneously.
The projection is a dream. All our projections -- of</p><p>greed, lust, power, anger -- are simply dreams.</p><p>Ejaku is right as a common-sense approach. But I don't agree, because
I know you can be a buddha this very moment. All the wanderings in past
lives into darkness cannot prevent you. It is like saying a room has
been dark for centuries and you bring a small candlelight ... the
darkness cannot say, "I will not go so immediately. I have been here
occupying this room for centuries. It goes against the constitution of
India; you cannot throw away the occupant in a single moment. Go through
a proper channel. First go to the court, claim that you have the right."
But the darkness does not say anything. You just bring a small candle,
and the darkness disappears.</p><p>In fact the darkness has no substance. It is an absence. So when you
bring the light, the absence disappears; it was the absence of the
light.</p><p>If you can go in, pushing aside the whole crowd of habits -- just
like an arrow, with force, gathering your whole energy inwards -- you
can prove Ejaku wrong. Although what he is saying is out of compassion,
perhaps most people will have to follow what he is saying.</p><p>THE HABITS OF ERRONEOUS THINKING ARE SO DEEP-ROOTED IN YOU THAT</p><p>IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO UPROOT THEM OVERNIGHT.</p><p>I say unto you it is extremely simple to throw them this very moment.
Those habits have been formed in darkness and unconsciousness; they
don't have any substance in them.</p><p>I was talking to a friend. He was a professor in the same university
I was, and he was continuously harassing me -- "Do something! I want to
drop this habit of smoking. Many times I try: one hour, two hours, three
hours, and then it becomes too much. The urge ... I think, 'It is better
to have a cigarette. Next time we will try in better conditions; right
now I am too tense.' So many times I have decided, but it fails. Every
time, rather than being a success it has been a failure, and now it has
become written in my memory that I cannot succeed. Just show me how to
drop it."</p><p>I said, "Are you ready?"</p><p>He said, "I am ready to do anything."</p><p>Then I said, "Do one thing. Come with me to my home, and I will not
let you out until this habit is gone."</p><p>He said, "What do you mean? Are you going to torture me or
something?"</p><p>I said, "No torture, just chain smoking. Sitting before me you have
to smoke to your heart's content."</p><p>He said, "I never heard such a thing from anybody else. I have been
talking about dropping this habit."</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 117</p><p>Chapter 9 - The simple task of turning in</p><p>I said, "You have been bragging. All this talk about dropping this
habit is just a strategy of the mind to brag that 'I am trying, but what
to do?' But today you are caught in a lion's den.</p><p>Just come and sit behind me in my car and forget the world. On the
way we will purchase cigarettes -- as many as the car can contain."</p><p>He said, "My God, you will kill me!"</p><p>I said, "It does not matter. Either you will leave dead or you will
leave the habit!"</p><p>Hesitantly, afraid, he said, "I always have heard that you are a
strange type, but I never thought that just by telling you I would get
trapped. Do you really mean it?"</p><p>I said, "Just sit down in the car, and on the way I will fill the
whole car ..."</p><p>He was looking at me and he said, "What are you doing? That much
smoking will kill me!"</p><p>I said, "There is no way out now. Chain smoking means chain smoking.
When</p><p>you drop one cigarette, immediately take another; take the fire from
the first cigarette to the second cigarette. And I will be
watching."</p><p>Just after three or four packets he said, "Can I go home, before
..."</p><p>"No way! Either your dead body will go out, or you will have to drop
this habit that you have been bragging about."</p><p>He said, "I promise."</p><p>I said, "I don't want to interfere in anybody else's life, but you
offered yourself."</p><p>He burned his lips, he burned his hands. It must have taken about six
hours, and after six hours he was so tired ... smoking and smoking. And
a crowd of the neighbors gathered, and they started talking -- "Is this
man mad or something?" And all over, cigarettes and ashes.</p><p>Finally he said, "Let me go!"</p><p>I said, "I will not let you go. Do you see my guard? He will put you
back in your place, and if you don't smoke he will force you to smoke.
This time or never!"</p><p>He said, "It is better I drop this habit. But let me go home!"</p><p>I said, "Be a man of your word. If you are found smoking again you
will have to commit suicide -- hara-kiri. A man of his word has no other
way. If he goes against his word, he has to commit hara-kiri."</p><p>He said, "I promise. I will commit hara-kiri, but at least right now
let me go home!"</p><p>I followed him for many days. He tried to escape, he wouldn't look at
me. But when I take something into my hands I do it.</p><p>I used to go every day to his home to ask his wife how things were
going. She was of course on my side; she was my detective in his home.
Even the small children of the poor professor were all working for me.
They would say, "Uncle, you have done a miracle! He is so afraid. Even
to mention the word 'cigarette' and he starts perspiring. That
experience you have given him ... Since that experience -- we don't know
what experience, he simply says, 'Since that</p><p>experience I am finished. Because that man is so dangerous, if I even
touch a cigarette he will force me to commit hara-kiri. And I want to
live, cigarettes or no cigarettes.'"</p><p>The question is, if you have really decided, if you are in an honest
search for yourself, then you can prove Ejaku wrong. And I would like
you to prove him wrong, although he is making Osho - The Miracle</p><p>118</p><p>Chapter 9 - The simple task of turning in</p><p>a very common-sense statement. Ordinarily it takes lives to drop old
habits. But that simply means you are not really wanting to drop them.
If you want to drop, it takes only a simple, single moment, because all
old habits are your own projections.</p><p>THIS IS WHY ONE IS COMPELLED TO RESORT TO THE USE OF MAKE-
BELIEVE</p><p>EXPEDIENTS IN ORDER TO STRIP YOU OF YOUR CRUDE WAYS OF THINKING.</p><p>THIS IS ON A PAR WITH WHAT A PARENT SOMETIMES WOULD DO IN ORDER</p><p>TO STOP HIS LITTLE CHILD FROM CRYING -- GIVING HIM SOME YELLOW</p><p>LEAVES, MAKING BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE PRECIOUS COINS. IT IS ALSO
LIKE</p><p>A MAN SETTING UP A STORE STOCKED WITH ALL KINDS OF GOODS FOR
DAILY</p><p>USE, AS WELL AS ARTICLES OF GOLD AND JADE, TO ACCOMMODATE</p><p>CUSTOMERS OF DIFFERENT ABILITIES. AS I HAVE OFTEN SAID, SEKITO'S IS A
GOLD SHOP, WHILE MINE IS A GENERAL STORE ...</p><p>Sekito is sitting here in front of me, behind the camera. In this new
reincarnation he is called Niskriya, the Stonehead. Sekito means the
Stonehead. He was a great master.</p><p>Ejaku says that Sekito has a gold shop -- only very refined people
can become his disciples. Ordinary ones are simply given a good beating
and thrown out. They never come back to Sekito's temple. Only very rare,
extraordinary seekers will take all the beatings but will not leave the
steps. Sometimes it happened that a person would sit there for months
before Sekito would allow him to come in. It may be raining, it may be
winter, it may be summer, but unless Sekito is convinced that the man
has a will, that he has not come just out of curiosity but in every way
he wants to seek and search himself ...</p><p>... WHILE MINE IS A GENERAL STORE, SELLING ALL AND SUNDRY.</p><p>Ejaku was a different kind of master -- not hard, he never hit
anybody. He never slapped any disciple. Naturally he attracted the
wishy-washy people. But in a general store you cannot find great
shoppers like Avirbhava. Now she has gone to Hong Kong to find other
gods worshipped in the past, because there is going to be a fair of
toys. She is not here today.</p><p>Yesterday she did her show of the great rat. Now she has gone in
search of finding something even greater.</p><p>Ejaku is saying, "I serve all and sundry; even the curious ones are
accepted. One never knows: today the person may be curious, tomorrow he
may become really a longing. A chance has to be given."</p><p>Both are right. Sekito works on the very special ones; Ejaku works on
everyone, of any category. Both are needed.</p><p>IF I DEALT ONLY WITH THE ESSENCE OF MEDITATION, I WOULD BE LEFT</p><p>ALL ALONE.</p><p>To deal with the essence of meditation alone ... that's what I am
doing. But even dealing only with meditation, I don't have a general
store. I have my ways of choosing the best and the most intelligent.
Just because of my words, those who are curious will not stay here.
There is nothing for them here.</p><p>Those who have stayed with me have stayed because they started
feeling the essence of meditation, slowly slowly, like a cool breeze or
a full-moon night or a roseflower in all its beauty. They have found
something, and now they are certain there is much more. This certainty
creates trust. And without this trust, Ejaku is right: if a man simply
deals with Osho - The Miracle</p><p>119</p><p>Chapter 9 - The simple task of turning in</p><p>meditation he will be left alone, because who wants meditation? And
when there is no demand, what is the point of keeping the store
open?</p><p>I have tried in a unique way to call forth from all over the world
the most intelligent ones. I am not alone. It is not only that you are
here -- there are two million people around the earth who are
meditating, whose only concern is meditation; everything else in life
has become meaningless.</p><p>But Ejaku is making a common sense statement: if you deal only with
meditation, people will desert you. Seeing this, masters deal with
scriptures, mantras, to keep you engaged. Some day may come the right
moment that you can be introduced into meditation.</p><p>I am totally different from Sekito or Ejaku, although I am doing the
same work. But neither do I hit you, nor do I push you away, nor do I
wait. I make the atmosphere available to you. All kinds of people, in
this atmosphere, can have a little experience. And that little
experience starts growing just like a seed grows into a huge cedar,
aspiring to the stars.</p><p>Those who were more concerned with non-essentials have come and gone.
In these thirty years thousands of people have passed -- but now, as we
are coming to the most precious experience, deeper and deeper, only
those who are authentically interested in digging for the gold have
remained.</p><p>Now this assembly has become one of the greatest assemblies of
seekers that has ever been on the earth.</p><p>Ejaku says: IF I DEALT ONLY WITH THE ESSENCE OF MEDITATION, I
WOULD</p><p>BE LEFT ALL ALONE.</p><p>Ordinarily that is true.</p><p>EVEN A SINGLE COMPANION WOULD BE HARD TO GET, TO SAY NOTHING OF</p><p>A COMMUNITY OF FIVE OR SEVEN HUNDRED MONKS. IF, ON THE OTHER HAND, I
TALKED ABOUT THINGS OF EAST AND WEST, PEOPLE WOULD COME IN</p><p>FLOCKS, PRICKING UP THEIR EARS TO CATCH EVERY BIT OF MY TALES.
THAT</p><p>WOULD BE LIKE SHOWING AN EMPTY FIST TO LITTLE CHILDREN,
PRETENDING</p><p>THAT THERE ARE CANDIES IN IT. THIS IS JUST HUMBUG.</p><p>He is very honest. He is saying, "I have to create all kinds of
things, but all those things are just humbug." Just as you can engage a
child with toys and he forgets that he was crying, you can engage
thousands of people ... in fact they are engaged. What are the churches
doing, what are the synagogues doing, what are the temples doing?
Dealing with non-essentials. And flocks of millions of people</p><p>... And these holy places and these so-called great priests go on
watching what the need of the people is. They immediately supply their
need, so that they remain entangled in the net of Hinduism or
Christianity or Judaism.</p><p>I have heard that three rabbis were talking about their
congregations. The first rabbi said,</p><p>"My congregation is the most up-to-date. You can even smoke
cigarettes inside the synagogue. You can play cards and gamble."</p><p>The second one said, "That is nothing. In my synagogue I have already
entered the twenty-first century. People can make love and do whatever
they want to do. They can drink wine, they can dance. After all, one has
to have a congregation; otherwise we will lose our profession, our
salaries. So whatever they want to do, let them do."</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 120</p><p>Chapter 9 - The simple task of turning in</p><p>The third one said, "That's nothing. In my synagogue there is a sign
in front of the synagogue on which it is written, 'This synagogue is
closed on Saturdays and all Jewish holidays.'" What more do you want?
This is the most ultra-modern! People are happy, very much rejoiced, to
be members of a synagogue which is always closed, which does not bother
them at all with old sermons.</p><p>But all the religions have been keeping people engaged with the
non-essentials.</p><p>Ejaku is very sincere. He says, "It is not in my capacity to deal
only with the essential Zen.</p><p>I know that I will not find even a single companion. So I go on
giving them devices, scriptures, mantras and all kinds of things -- a
general store. But it is all humbug."</p><p>Do you know what 'humbug' means? It was Charles Darwin's sixtieth
birthday, and he was very friendly with children. So all the children of
the neighborhood decided, "Precious presents will be coming to the great
scientist. We poor children, what can we do? But something has to be
presented to the great scientist who is our friend." So one small boy
came up with a great idea, and they managed it. They found all kinds of
insects ... because that was the interest of Charles Darwin. Working out
his theory of evolution, he was looking into insects, into animals, in
every place.</p><p>What they did was cut up all those insects and made a new insect. The
body of one insect, the legs of another, the face of a third, the tail
of a fourth ... and they made it so perfectly and beautifully that
anybody could be deceived. They brought their present to the great
Darwin and asked him, "Uncle, can you say what it is? You are such a
great scientist, you must know the name."</p><p>He looked and he could not imagine ... He had never come across such
an insect. He looked again and again, and then finally he saw that it
was not one insect -- the legs are different, the tail is different, the
head is different. But the boys had done a great artistic job, so he
said, "This is a humbug. Its name is humbug."</p><p>Most of the people are humbugs. They are carrying something from
somebody, something from somebody else. They are not themselves, they
are many people, a multitude. They are a crowd.</p><p>Says Ejaku:</p><p>NOW, LET ME TELL YOU IN ALL PLAINNESS: DO NOT DIVERT YOUR MIND TO</p><p>THE HOLY THINGS; RATHER, DIRECT IT TO YOUR SELF-NATURE, AND</p><p>CULTIVATE YOURSELF WITH YOUR FEET ON THE GROUND. DO NOT DESIRE</p><p>THE THREE "GIFTS OF VISION," AND THE SIX "SUPERNATURAL POWERS."
WHY?</p><p>BECAUSE THESE ARE ONLY ACCIDENTALS OF HOLINESS.</p><p>THE ONE THING ESSENTIAL NOW IS TO RECOLLECT YOUR MIND TO ATTAIN</p><p>THE FUNDAMENTAL, THE VERY ROOT OF YOUR BEING. HAVING ARRIVED AT</p><p>THE ROOT, YOU NEED HAVE NO WORRY ABOUT THE ACCIDENTALS.</p><p>All the virtues come on their own as you become conscious, so don't
cultivate those virtues. They will be artificial and they will become
preventive, hindrances on the way to your own self.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 121</p><p>Chapter 9 - The simple task of turning in</p><p>Don't ask for miracles. A man of meditation is himself a miracle.
Whatever he does is a miracle. It is a beauty, it is magic, but it is
all spontaneous. It is not</p><p>practiced, it is not rehearsed.</p><p>But most people are interested in supernatural powers, healing people
with supernatural powers, or creating things out of nothing, just as
Satya Sai Baba is doing. All kinds of frauds ... but people become
interested in them, thinking that here is a man of miracles. And what is
the miracle if you can produce a Swiss watch which was hiding in your
sleeve ...?</p><p>One old Parsi woman came to me in Bombay. Satya Sai Baba used to stay
at her place, and she told me, "One day when he had gone into the
bathroom, just out of curiosity I looked into his suitcases. They were
all full of watches! I could not believe that this man was
deceiving."</p><p>She said, "I kicked him out. I told him, 'Never again come in my
house!' I cannot be a partner to any kind of fraud." She told me, "I am
an old woman. Nobody listens to me, they think I have gone senile. I
have come to you ... perhaps you can do something about it."</p><p>I said, "I have been challenging Satya Sai Baba, saying that this is
stupid. When the country is dying of starvation, produce more food out
of your miracles. He should bring rain to Hyderabad" ... where the
Shankaracharya of Puri is going to force a woman to be burned alive on
her husband's funeral pyre, and only then rain will come. And Satya Sai
Baba is not far away from Hyderabad. Bring rain to Hyderabad -- do some
real work! All that he produces is ash, and he gives you the ash and you
think it is great. It is so simple that any street magician can do it.
In fact the more experienced street magicians can do it in a far better
way, and can do many more things than he is doing.</p><p>I have no objection to him as a magician, but he should not pretend
to be a spiritual man. It is not only a question of a single person
pretending to be spiritual when he is not. The question is that he
attracts thousands of people, mediocre people, who believe that this man
of miracles may impart something to them, may lead them to the ultimate
truth.</p><p>Ejaku is right: don't bother about supernatural powers, THREE "GIFTS
OF VISION."</p><p>THE ONE THING ESSENTIAL NOW IS TO RECOLLECT YOUR MIND TO ATTAIN</p><p>THE FUNDAMENTAL, THE VERY ROOT OF YOUR BEING. HAVING ARRIVED AT</p><p>THE ROOT, YOU NEED HAVE NO WORRY ABOUT THE ACCIDENTALS. IN TIME</p><p>YOU WILL FIND THAT YOU ARE SELF-PROVIDED WITH ALL THESE</p><p>ACCIDENTAL GIFTS AND POWERS. ON THE OTHER HAND, SO LONG AS YOU</p><p>HAVE NOT GOT THE ROOT, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE SUCH GIFTS</p><p>AND POWERS THROUGH STUDY AND LEARNING.</p><p>A very honest man, saying simply two things: one, turn your lights
in; second, don't be concerned with accidentals, non-essentials. As you
become an enlightened man, miracles follow you like a shadow. You don't
have to do them, they happen around you, in your very air.</p><p>And the greatest miracle is that whoever comes in contact with the
awakened one tastes for the first time the sweetness of awakening, the
grace of awakening, and a longing arises in him which he has never
thought about -- to be a buddha himself.</p><p>The greatest miracle in the world is to bring people to the
recognition of their buddhahood.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 122</p><p>Chapter 9 - The simple task of turning in A Zen poet wrote:</p><p>IN THE BOTTOMLESS BAMBOO BASKET I PUT THE WHITE MOON;</p><p>IN THE BOWL OF MINDLESSNESS I STORE THE PURE BREEZE.</p><p>These are true miracles. They happen on their own in your silences of
the heart. Seigensai wrote:</p><p>THIS GRASPED, ALL IS DUST -- THE SERMON FOR TODAY. LANDS, SEAS.</p><p>AWAKENED, YOU WALK THE EARTH ALONE.</p><p>Everything is dust once you understand yourself. And the moment you
understand yourself you find your aloneness so beautiful, so precious,
that you don't get lost in the crowd and its stupid ideologies. You
become for the first time an individual on your own; you are no more a
Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Christian. You simply belong to the universe.
You are a universal man. This is the greatest miracle.</p><p>Another Zen poem, by Nensho:</p><p>ONLY GENUINE AWAKENING RESULTS IN THAT. ONLY FOOLS SEEK SAINTHOOD FOR
REWARD. LIFTING A HAND,</p><p>THE STONE LANTERN ANNOUNCES DAYBREAK. SMILING, THE VOID NODS ITS
ENORMOUS HEAD.</p><p>What Nensho is saying is: Why are you trying to be a saint? --
because saints will be rewarded in heaven. All your virtues are just
making a way towards paradise, where you will be provided all kinds of
pleasures. What are your saints torturing themselves for? Hoping that
the more they torture themselves, the closer is paradise. And what does
paradise provide?</p><p>Naked young women, rivers of wine, no work; everybody is given a harp
... drink the wine, find a girlfriend, play on the harp, Alleluia!
That's all that is happening in paradise.</p><p>And I say to you that your saints will look very hilarious. Here they
have been torturing themselves, they have become ugly, rotten. And those
girlfriends in heaven are plastic, because they have been serving since
eternity. I have never heard that anybody goes into retirement. They
remain always stuck at the age of sixteen. Time goes on, but they don't
grow old -- only plastic can do that. Plastic never grows old, never
dies.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 123</p><p>Chapter 9 - The simple task of turning in</p><p>And the descriptions in the scriptures make me convinced, because
those girls don't perspire. Skin is bound to perspire, that is its very
life, it is its breathing. Every pore of the skin is breathing. And
there is a reason why it perspires: perspiration keeps your temperature
the same so that whether it is cold outside or hot outside, it doesn't
matter. Your life is dependent on your temperature. From ninety-six
degrees to one hundred and eight -- just twelve degrees is your
lifespan. If you go beyond one hundred and eight, you have gone beyond.
Perspiration keeps you below that level, because it keeps the heat
engaged -- the perspiration becomes evaporated, so the heat becomes
engaged in evaporating the perspiration and forgets you completely. It
is a miracle.</p><p>When it is cold, you start shivering, even your teeth start
chattering. Do you know what for? This is all to keep you warm.</p><p>I have heard stories -- I don't believe them -- that people will
leave their false teeth in the bathroom, and in the cold those teeth,
out of old habit, start chattering. I don't know ... but there are
stories on record. Perhaps just an old habit ...</p><p>Your shivering keeps you warm. Otherwise your temperature will fall
and that will be again death. Your lifespan is just within those twelve
degrees.</p><p>Now those beautiful ladies in paradise never grow old, they always
remain</p><p>young. I cannot conceive that they have been serving all the saints
for millions of years, and still nobody calls them prostitutes! They are
the only eternal prostitutes. And these saints are dreaming about them.
Here it is prohibited, you cannot drink wine; it is a sin according to
many religions. But the same religions provide rivers of wine -- there
is no need to drink, you can drown! Here, every religion goes on working
on every child: "Do something; otherwise you will be a hobo."</p><p>And what are all your saints doing in paradise? -- hobos, playing on
their harps. Hippies were simply imitating your saints in paradise,
playing their guitars and doing nothing.</p><p>It is such a boredom to conceive that for millions of years you will
be just playing on your harp. There is nothing else to do. You can have
as many women as you want, you can drink as much alcohol as you want.
Perhaps to make it up- to-date, God may have provided new drugs</p><p>-- LSD, heroin, hashish -- because the saints have earned them by
their virtue; this is their reward.</p><p>A genuine search is not for any reward. It is just to know who I am,
why I am, what I am.</p><p>It is a pure search to be acquainted with oneself, because that is
the only way to find some connection with the universal spirit.</p><p>Nensho has a beautiful metaphor. He says, "All these saints, what
they are doing in declaring their saintliness is like lifting a hand
with a stone lantern, announcing daybreak."</p><p>But all over, there is darkness. It is not daybreak. These saints are
just stone lanterns, they are not the sunrise.</p><p>And the universe smiles at these fools: the void, the immense void,
nods its enormous head, smiling.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 124</p><p>Chapter 9 - The simple task of turning in Question 1</p><p>Maneesha has asked:</p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>IF YOU WERE TO USE JUST ONE WORD TO DESCRIBE THE ESSENCE OF TRUE</p><p>RELIGIOUSNESS, ONE WORD THAT IS THE KEY TO BEING ABLE TO DROP</p><p>WHATEVER HAS BEEN AND SIMPLY LIVE ONE MOMENT AT A TIME -- WHAT</p><p>WOULD THAT ONE WORD BE?</p><p>Maneesha, that one word is in.

THERE</p><p>IS A LAMP THERE IS LIGHT; IF THERE IS NO LAMP THERE IS NO LIGHT.
THE</p><p>LAMP IS THE SUBSTANCE OF LIGHT; THE LIGHT IS THE FUNCTION OF THE</p><p>LAMP. THUS, ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE TWO NAMES, IN SUBSTANCE THEY ARE</p><p>NOT TWO. MEDITATION AND WISDOM ARE ALSO LIKE THIS.</p><p>Maneesha, the understanding of mind ultimately ends in the
understanding of meditation.</p><p>The function of the mind is to divide things. Duality is its
territory: darkness and light, life and death. The mind cannot conceive
anything which has not its</p><p>opposite.</p><p>But existence is not obliged to function according to the mind. In
existence day and night merge into each other, every evening, every
morning. They are not separate. Neither are life and death separate. If
they were separate it would be possible for someone to go on living, and
not to allow death to enter into his house.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 129</p><p>Chapter 10 - Sun and moon in one's sleeve</p><p>An ancient Chinese story will help you to understand the great Zen
master Eno. His every statement is a scripture in itself.</p><p>The ancient story is that a great emperor, being afraid of death,
created a palace with a single door. No other doors, no other windows,
no way of entering into the palace except from one small door where he
had placed a complete row of guards. Guard number one was to be guarded
by number two, and guard number two was guarded by number three, and
guard number three was guarded by number four ... seven guards watching
each other! More protection is not possible.</p><p>A neighboring king heard about it, and he wanted to see this most
secure palace. He was welcomed. The owner of the palace took him in,
showed him all the facilities inside, that there was no way for any
enemy, for any thief, for any killer to enter.</p><p>The king was very much impressed. He said, "I will immediately order
the same. Just give me the names of the architects, to make the same
palace for me in my kingdom."</p><p>Talking with each other, they came out to where the chariot of the
king was waiting. And when he said, "I'm going to make exactly the same
palace. I loved it, the very idea. It is so safe and secure ..." a
beggar by the side of the road started laughing madly.</p><p>Both were stunned. For a moment there was silence.</p><p>They both asked the beggar, "Why are you laughing?"</p><p>He said, "I'm laughing because there is a loophole in all this, and I
know the loophole. I have been sitting in this place for years, begging,
so I have been watching the building of the palace."</p><p>The emperor asked, "What is the loophole?" He said, "That one
door!"</p><p>The emperor laughed. He said, "I have placed seven guards on it. They
are guarding on each other, nobody can betray. What is the fear?"</p><p>The beggar said, "With due respect, I want to tell you that death
will enter and your guards will not be able to see it. And death is the
only insecurity. What else? Do you have any protection against
death?"</p><p>The emperor was at a loss.</p><p>The beggar said, "My suggestion is that if you want really to be
secure, tell your builders to raise a wall in place of that door! I
still cannot guarantee that death will not enter -- but at least you
have made as much effort as possible; close the door and be inside."</p><p>The emperor said, "But that means I'm already dead! It becomes a
grave, not a palace, if I cannot come out."</p><p>The beggar said, "If you think just by closing one door your life
will be finished, don't you think that by closing other doors, parts of
your life are finished? By closing the windows, other parts of your life
are finished? You are going to live at the minimum, while the maximum
was available."</p><p>Both the kings were surprised to see the intelligence of the beggar.
They came close to him and they asked him, "From where have you
come?"</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 130</p><p>Chapter 10 - Sun and moon in one's sleeve</p><p>He said, "You will not understand. Your fathers were my friends. Once
I also used to be an emperor. But seeing the whole unnecessary trouble,
I made myself completely secure -- I dropped all walls, all worries,
opened all windows. Now for almost half a century nobody has harmed me.
I'm just a beggar -- why should anyone harm me? I have nothing to be
stolen. I sleep as I have never slept before."</p><p>If you really want to be living at the maximum, don't listen to the
duality of the mind.</p><p>The only security in existence is going beyond the mind.</p><p>The beggar was a great Taoist master. His name was Lieh Tzu. But
people had forgotten that fifty years before he had dropped his
kingdom.</p><p>He said, "The only security I have found is in being silent, in being
myself, where all duality disappears. Where you and the universe are
one, then death cannot do anything."</p><p>You have disappeared on your own accord; now there is no way to harm
you. There is nobody to harm you. The body is not you, the mind is not
you. You are just a guest in a house.</p><p>Don't get identified with the house, just remember the guest. This
statement of Eno is tremendously beautiful:</p><p>GOOD FRIENDS, MY TEACHING OF THE DHARMA TAKES MEDITATION AND</p><p>WISDOM AS ITS BASIS. NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SAY</p><p>MISTAKENLY THAT MEDITATION AND WISDOM ARE DIFFERENT; THEY ARE A
UNITY, NOT TWO THINGS.</p><p>But all the so-called intelligent people of the world have taken them
as two things.</p><p>Meditation is for the mystics and wisdom comes from accumulating
knowledge from the scriptures, from the old traditions. They have
degraded wisdom to</p><p>knowledge -- borrowed knowledge.</p><p>Eno is saying that wisdom is the fragrance of meditation; they are
not separable. You cannot have wisdom without meditation and you cannot
have meditation without wisdom. In fact, they are two names for one
phenomenon.</p><p>To be yourself, silently and fully aware, is to know without any
doubt that meditation and wisdom are one.</p><p>Meditation is the source and wisdom is the radiation. Meditation is
your understanding and wisdom is your action according to that
understanding. Meditation is your inner experience and wisdom is its
outer expression.</p><p>A man of meditation cannot do anything wrong. And a man of so-called
wisdom alone is just a parrot. He goes on repeating, but his heart is
not touched by his own repetitions.</p><p>A priest had two parrots. They were very good, saintly, with their
rosaries in their hands, repeating Ave Maria. But once in a while they
would become very sad, both of them at the same time. So he thought
perhaps they needed a companion.</p><p>He went to the pet shop, thinking certainly they need a companion,
because both are male; they need a female at least to share with. So he
bought a female, and as he put the female Osho - The Miracle</p><p>131</p><p>Chapter 10 - Sun and moon in one's sleeve</p><p>parrot into their cage, one parrot said to the other, "Johnny, now
drop the rosary! There is no need of it, our prayers have been
heard!"</p><p>The priest could not believe that these idiots had been praying for
their own reasons, not for the Christian religion. They both dropped
their rosaries.</p><p>A man who thinks that through borrowed knowledge he is wise, is not
only befooling himself but others also. His wisdom is just a memory, not
a knowing, because knowing blossoms only through meditation.</p><p>Eno says:</p><p>NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SAY MISTAKENLY THAT</p><p>MEDITATION AND WISDOM ARE DIFFERENT; THEY ARE A UNITY, NOT TWO</p><p>THINGS. MEDITATION ITSELF IS THE SUBSTANCE OF WISDOM; WISDOM
ITSELF</p><p>IS THE FUNCTION OF MEDITATION. AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THERE IS</p><p>WISDOM, THEN MEDITATION EXISTS IN WISDOM; AT THE VERY MOMENT</p><p>WHEN THERE IS MEDITATION, THEN WISDOM EXISTS IN MEDITATION.</p><p>GOOD FRIENDS, THIS MEANS THAT MEDITATION AND WISDOM ARE ALIKE.</p><p>STUDENTS, BE CAREFUL NOT TO SAY THAT MEDITATION GIVES RISE TO</p><p>WISDOM, OR THAT WISDOM GIVES RISE TO MEDITATION, OR THAT MEDITATION
AND WISDOM ARE DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER.</p><p>TO HOLD THIS VIEW IMPLIES THAT THINGS HAVE DUALITY -- IF GOOD IS</p><p>SPOKEN WHILE THE MIND IS NOT GOOD, MEDITATION AND WISDOM WILL NOT</p><p>BE ALIKE. IF MIND AND SPEECH ARE BOTH GOOD, THEN THE INTERNAL AND</p><p>THE EXTERNAL ARE THE SAME, AND MEDITATION AND WISDOM ARE ALIKE.</p><p>THE PRACTICE OF SELF-AWAKENING DOES NOT LIE IN VERBAL</p><p>ARGUMENTS. IF YOU ARGUE WHICH COMES FIRST, MEDITATION OR WISDOM, YOU
ARE DELUDED PEOPLE. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SETTLE THE ARGUMENT, AND
INSTEAD WILL CLING TO OBJECTIVE THINGS, AND WILL NEVER ESCAPE</p><p>FROM THE FOUR STATES OF PHENOMENA. ENO ADDED:</p><p>GOOD FRIENDS, HOW THEN ARE MEDITATION AND WISDOM ALIKE? THEY</p><p>ARE LIKE THE LAMP AND THE LIGHT IT GIVES FORTH. IF THERE IS A
LAMP</p><p>THERE IS LIGHT; IF THERE IS NO LAMP THERE IS NO LIGHT. THE LAMP IS
THE</p><p>SUBSTANCE OF LIGHT; THE LIGHT IS THE FUNCTION OF THE LAMP. THUS,
ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE TWO NAMES, IN SUBSTANCE THEY ARE NOT TWO.</p><p>MEDITATION AND WISDOM ARE ALSO LIKE THIS.</p><p>Eno is making a significant statement. You are standing on a road --
inwards is the realm of meditation. And if you reach to the point where
you touch your very being, then outwardly you can express your
meditation in everything that you do. All your gestures, all your
actions, even your silences -- not doing anything, just sitting -- will
also express the radiance, the fragrance, the beauty, the joy of
meditation. This is wisdom.</p><p>But people have been misled by parents, by teachers, by priests, by
everyone, to accumulate wisdom. You can accumulate great wisdom and yet
you will be just a learned Osho - The Miracle</p><p>132</p><p>Chapter 10 - Sun and moon in one's sleeve</p><p>idiot. Your behavior will show it, your actions will show it; just
your words will be in consonance with the scriptures.</p><p>The authentic wisdom does not come from outside. The authentic wisdom
comes when you have gone deeper into your being and found the center of
your life -- then suddenly an explosion. Everything that you do or don't
do expresses your wisdom.</p><p>Wisdom is just the fragrance of a rose. Find the rose first and the
fragrance will be found on its own accord. Don't even make the
distinction of which comes first, because they are not two. They are
one, looked at from two sides -- one from inside and one from
outside.</p><p>Whatever is your enlightenment expresses itself inside as meditation,
and outside as wisdom.</p><p>Neither comes first, they are one. The outer and the inner both are
together.</p><p>But mind always creates distinctions, separations. And it is because
of the mind that you get into unnecessary troubles: philosophic
conflicts, theological arguments. You waste your time on books looking
for something that may help you to find yourself.</p><p>You cannot find, anywhere, anything that will help you to find
yourself. You have to be clear about it: you are not to be found, you
are already here. You have just to recognize the fact.</p><p>A master does not teach you to be yourself; he simply makes you
recognize what is hidden behind your heartbeat. In his presence a
certain synchronicity happens. You simply be close to a master,
silently, and you start feeling a rush of energy flowing towards you,
making you afire. It is invisible to the spectators; only the
participants are the blessed ones.</p><p>Once you know yourself, you are in meditation and your actions will
show wisdom.</p><p>A Zen poet wrote:</p><p>TO HAVE THE SUN AND MOON IN ONE'S SLEEVE;</p><p>TO HOLD THE UNIVERSE</p><p>IN THE PALM OF ONE'S HAND.</p><p>And his haiku is complete. Just remember one hand, just remember one
sleeve. TO HAVE THE SUN AND MOON IN ONE'S SLEEVE,</p><p>TO HOLD THE UNIVERSE</p><p>IN THE PALM OF ONE'S HAND.</p><p>When you open your hand, don't you have the whole universe in your
palm? Just don't close it. The closed hand is the poorest; it has
nothing in it.</p><p>It is a strange thing, that every child is born with a closed hand,
and everybody dies with an open hand. It has never been heard of that
anybody has died with a closed hand, because to close the hand you need
energy. The open hand needs no energy, no tension. A closed hand will
get tired. The dying man cannot afford the energy to close his fist.</p><p>But it is beautiful to go deeper into the question of why every child
is born with closed hands. It signifies that every child is born with
great hopes and expectations and desires.</p><p>Those closed hands are showing that he has to make something of
himself -- to be successful, Osho - The Miracle</p><p>133</p><p>Chapter 10 - Sun and moon in one's sleeve</p><p>rich, politically powerful. It is an unconscious, very deep-rooted
expression of his being. He comes into the world with great secrets;
soon he will start getting frustrated. No success succeeds.</p><p>In fact, every success ends up in failure, in a deep frustration,
because what you wanted is not found.</p><p>The old man dying has nothing to hold on to. No desire, no
expectation ... he</p><p>moves into death just like a beggar.</p><p>When Alexander the Great died, he told his ministers, "Keep my hands
hanging outside of the coffin."</p><p>They said, "Strange idea!" It had never been heard of. Nobody had
done it. A dead man should behave and keep his hands inside the
coffin.</p><p>But Alexander said, "It is my order and it has to be fulfilled! It is
my last wish. It does not matter that nobody else has done it; it's
going to be done to me. Keep my hands hanging outside the casket!"</p><p>They said, "But why this idea?"</p><p>Alexander said, "Millions of people will come to see. I want to make
it clear to them that I had come into the world with closed fists, with
great expectations, with great secret desires -- I am going from the
world utterly frustrated, with open hands. I'm not taking anything with
me.</p><p>All that I had has proved to be just a delusion."</p><p>Meditation makes you an open hand. Mind is very secretive; mind goes
on keeping your desires, your angers, your frustrations, your miseries,
all secret -- a closed fist. Meditation is an opening of the fist. And
then the whole universe is in your hands. A small haiku with a great
meaning ...</p><p>Ikkyu wrote:</p><p>SHOULD YOU SEEK</p><p>THE WAY OF THE BUDDHA ALL NIGHT LONG, SEARCHING, YOU WILL ENTER INTO
YOUR OWN MIND.</p><p>You can go on searching not only the whole night but the whole life
of unconsciousness and darkness, searching for Buddha. You will always
end up</p><p>with your mind.</p><p>You will not find the buddha because the buddha is not to be found by
searching. The buddha has to be simply recognized. Without making any
effort to seek and search, just look in. You are the buddha.</p><p>And immediately all your actions, all your ways of life, all your
functions, will change --</p><p>immediately. They will all carry the fragrance of a buddha. Osho -
The Miracle</p><p>134</p><p>Chapter 10 - Sun and moon in one's sleeve Another haiku:</p><p>HOWEVER MUCH WE POUR IN, NEVER TO BRIM OVER;</p><p>TO LADLE OUT, NEVER EXHAUSTING; MOREOVER, NOT TO KNOW THE REASON FOR
IT -- THIS IS CALLED THE HIDDEN LIGHT.</p><p>The light within you is perfect. You cannot take anything out of it,
nor can you add anything to it. It is a perfect circle, it is a
perfectly opened lotus. You cannot do anything to it; you can only
rejoice. You can dance, you can sing a song, in praise of the lotus that
has blossomed within your being.</p><p>Particularly, I want my people to know that meditation is not just
being silent -- that is only one part of it. Finally, it has to be
creative. And when a poetry comes out of your inner silences, or a
painting, it has a flavor which is not of this world.</p><p>Question 1 Maneesha has asked:</p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>WHEN YOU SAY EACH EVENING DURING THE MEDITATION, "GO IN, GO</p><p>DEEPER AND DEEPER LIKE AN ARROW TO YOUR CENTER," IS IT THAT THERE
IS</p><p>ACTUALLY NOWHERE TO GO AND NOTHING TO DO BECAUSE WE ARE</p><p>ALREADY IN?</p><p>IS ALL WE CAN DO JUST BE AWARE OF HOW AND WHEN WE PERPETUALLY</p><p>GO OUT, FURTHER AND FURTHER FROM OURSELVES?</p><p>Yes, Maneesha. There is nowhere to go. You are already there, where
you needed to be.</p><p>And once you recognize it, then you carry your consciousness wherever
you go. Then time makes no difference, nor does space. You are a buddha
in the temple and you are a buddha in the shop; you are a buddha sitting
silently, deep in meditation, and you are a buddha having a good laugh
with Sardar Gurudayal Singh.</p><p>It is midnight in Miami, and Glamorous Gladys arrives for a winter
holiday to find that all the hotels are full.</p><p>The receptionist at the four-star Screwing Sands Hotel suggests that
he can put her in to share a room with a nice man on the fifth floor,
named Donald Dickstein.</p><p>Gladys likes the idea and takes the room.</p><p>She enters the room quietly, takes a peek, and sees Donald sleeping
in one of the beds.</p><p>Then she turns on the bathroom light, leaves the door open, and
begins to slowly</p><p>and seductively take off her dress. Osho - The Miracle</p><p>135</p><p>Chapter 10 - Sun and moon in one's sleeve</p><p>Then she ever so slowly removes her bra. Bending in the light, she

her bed. Then she leans over and whispers to Donald, "Would you like to
come in my bed?"</p><p>"No thanks," replies Donald, wide awake. "I've already come in
mine!"</p><p>There is an explosion at a Polack salami factory, and one of the
salamis gets blown right to heaven. It lands at Saint Peter's feet.</p><p>"What a funny-looking thing," says Saint Peter, picking it up. And he
goes to show it to Jesus.</p><p>"Did you ever see such a thing?" Saint Peter asks Jesus.</p><p>"No," replies Jesus. "I've never seen one before." So, Saint Peter
takes it to show to Mary.</p><p>"Mary," he asks, "did you ever see something like this?"</p><p>"Oh!" exclaims Mary. "You know, if it didn't have that funny smell, I
would swear it was the Holy Ghost!"</p><p>Caroline Kratz goes to visit her local channeler to find out about

sex, sleep, eat, take a rest, go swimming, have sex, sleep, eat again,
have sex ..."</p><p>"Ah!" cries Caroline, "but down here you only made love to me once a

replies the parrot. "Habla espanol?" asks the old Jew. "Habla espanol?"
comes the reply. "Speak English?" asks Rubenstein. "Speak English?"
replies the bird.</p><p>Old Rubenstein goes closer to the parrot, and asks confidentially,
"Tell me, my friend, if you are so smart, do you speak Yiddish?"</p><p>The parrot fixes Rubenstein with its beady eyes: "Tell me, my
friend," says the bird, "you think I should not speak Yiddish with a
nose like this?"</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 136</p><p>Chapter 10 - Sun and moon in one's sleeve Okay, Nivedano ...</p><p>(Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano ...</p><p>(Drumbeat) Be silent ...</p><p>Close your eyes.</p><p>Feel your body to be frozen. Gather all your energy inside. Deeper

MASTER,</p><p>AN OLD MASTER SAID:</p><p>TURN YOUR HEART ROUND AND ENTER THE ORIGIN. DO NOT SEARCH FOR</p><p>WHAT HAS SPRUNG OUT OF IT! WHEN YOU HAVE GAINED THE ORIGIN, WHAT</p><p>HAS SPRUNG OUT OF IT WILL COME TO YOU OF ITSELF.</p><p>IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE ORIGIN, THEN PENETRATE YOUR OWN</p><p>ORIGINAL HEART. THIS HEART IS THE SOURCE OF ALL BEINGS IN THE
WORLD</p><p>AND OUTSIDE THE WORLD. WHEN THE HEART STIRS, VARIOUS THINGS
ARISE.</p><p>BUT WHEN THE HEART ITSELF BECOMES COMPLETELY EMPTY, THE VARIOUS</p><p>THINGS ALSO BECOME EMPTY. IF YOUR HEART IS DRIVEN ROUND NEITHER
BY</p><p>GOOD NOR BAD, THEN ALL THINGS ARE JUST AS THEY ARE.</p><p>MASTER OTSU, COMMENTING ON THIS EMPTYING OF THE HEART, SAID: THE
HEART BECOMES EMPTY, THE SITUATION QUIET, AND THE BODY JUST</p><p>AS IT IS. WHEN SOMEONE SUCCEEDS IN REACHING THIS POINT, THE
MIRROR</p><p>OF HIS HEART SHINES CLEARLY AND HIS NATURE OPENS WIDE AND CLEAR.
HE</p><p>LEAVES ERROR AND DOES NOT ATTACH HIMSELF TO TRUTH; HE DWELLS</p><p>NEITHER IN ERROR NOR AWAKENING. HE IS NEITHER WORLDLY</p><p>NOR SAINTLY.</p><p>ALL WORLDLY DESIRES FALL AWAY, AND AT THE SAME TIME, THE MEANING</p><p>OF SAINTLINESS IS EMPTIED WITHOUT RESIDUE.</p><p>SUCH DETACHMENT FROM EVERYTHING IS WHAT MASTER RINZAI CALLED</p><p>"THE COMPLETE TAKING AWAY OF BOTH, OF MAN AND SITUATION." HERE IS</p><p>EXPERIENCED ABSOLUTE NOT-NESS, SINCE SELF AND OBJECT ALLOW</p><p>THEMSELVES TO COME TO NOTHING.</p><p>GENUINE ZEN EXPERIENCE CONSISTS EXCLUSIVELY IN THIS "TAKING</p><p>AWAY OF MAN AND OBJECT." THIS COMPLETE NOT-NESS IS THE ORIGINAL</p><p>PLACE FROM WHICH ALL THINKING AND KNOWING SPRING. BUT EVEN IF ONE</p><p>IS PERMITTED TO SPEAK OF A "PLACE" AT ALL, SUCH TERMINOLOGY IS
ONLY</p><p>PROVISIONAL.</p><p>EVEN IF ONE WANTED TO CHARACTERIZE IT AS UNBORN-NESS, OR AS</p><p>NIRVANA, OR AS TRUTH, ONE COULD NEVER HIT IT. IT LIES BEYOND ALL</p><p>TERMINOLOGY AND EXPRESSION; THINKING CANNOT REACH THAT FAR.</p><p>Maneesha, there are four possible ways to explain the unexplainable.
Unconsciously, man has made philosophies out of those four ways.</p><p>Man is a crossroads, where four ways meet. The first way is that of
matter. The atheist takes that road, the scientist takes that road: "Man
is nothing but matter." From the days of the Osho - The Miracle</p><p>2</p><p>Chapter 1 - How full, emptiness!</p><p>charvakas to the days of Bertrand Russell, there have been great,
eminent thinkers who have chosen that path. And almost half of the world
today is on that path, because communism does not believe in anything
else but matter -- mind is only an epiphenomenon.</p><p>Epiphenomenon means just a shadow: when the man disappears, the
shadow disappears.</p><p>There is nothing beyond death, and there is nothing before birth. You
are complete between birth and death; that's all you have.</p><p>The second road defines man as a duality between matter and mind.
Most of the philosophers of the world have chosen that definition
because it seems completely rational.</p><p>All that we know about man is that his body consists of matter, and
we know that he has thoughts which are not material. These things can be
observed from outside. Hence, man is basically matter with an addition
of a shadow that is his mind. As the body dies, mind also dies. On this
path also, life extends only between birth and death.</p><p>The third possibility, which has been accepted by all religions, is
that man is not just matter or just mind; he is also a soul. Matter is
his outer expression, soul is his inner expression, and mind functions
as a bridge between the two. On the third path there is a possibility of
a life beyond death. The people who have accepted it have created on
this foundation the idea of reincarnation: birth after birth, one
changes houses but the essential soul remains.</p><p>Zen has a fourth standpoint. Man is not matter, although he is
covered with</p><p>matter. He is not mind, although he is covered with mind. Nor is he
an individual soul. He is a pure nothingness. Man, from this fourth
standpoint, which is the standpoint of Zen, is almost like an onion. You
go on peeling it, one layer after another layer, hoping that you are
going to find something. Finally, when you have peeled all the layers
off, your hands are full of emptiness; nothing is left. The onion was
only layers and layers and layers and layers. Behind those layers was
emptiness, nothingness, which will not be visible to the eyes, which
will not be tangible to the hands.</p><p>Zen has taken the ultimate standpoint about man, you cannot go beyond
that. Here ends the whole journey, the pilgrimage of the seeker.</p><p>Zen wants you not to stop at matter. Respect it, it serves you; care
for it, it cares for you.</p><p>You are not the mind -- don't make it a master. It is a good servant
-- use it. Use it so that you can reach beyond it. It is a ladder to go
beyond, but don't get caught up with it.</p><p>The "soul" is simply a consolation to people, because if you say to
them that meditation will end up in nothingness ... In a million,
perhaps one person will become interested in meditation. And if you tell
them, "All your effort will come to a vast nothingness," you will
frighten them. You will create a question in their minds: "Then what is
the purpose? We are --</p><p>at least, we are. Doing meditation, we will not be." It is going to
be the ultimate death. Yes.</p><p>Gautam Buddha was continually asked, "Why do people go on coming to
you when you offer nothing but nothingness?"</p><p>And Buddha said many times, "Nothingness is not just no-thing-ness.
It has its own universality. It is becoming as vast as the whole
universe, unlimited. Your personality is too small."</p><p>The people who are afraid of nothingness, of dissolving not only
their personality but their individuality too, remain with the third
standpoint.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle</p><p>3</p><p>Chapter 1 - How full, emptiness!</p><p>The third is very consoling. At least it gives you something to hang
on to. Zen does not give you anything; it simply takes away all the
layers of the onion and then says to you, "Look, this is you -- just
pure nothingness."</p><p>But the purity of it is so overwhelming that you are not, but your
laughter is. You are not, but your joy is. It has become cosmic. You are
not, but your ecstasy is, and now it is not confined to a small area of
your personality or individuality; now the whole of existence is
ecstatic. The birds flying and the flowers opening and the clouds
showering -- everything is happening in the deep nothingness of your
realization of the cosmic emptiness as the source of all things.</p><p>Perhaps Zen alone has given a very scientific answer to the question.
"From where do things come, and to where do they go back?" Even science
shrugs its shoulders the moment you start asking them questions about
the origin. All that has been said about the origin by the religions, by
the scientific people, is simply guesswork. Nobody was a witness,
obviously.</p><p>How can there be a witness when existence has not started yet? You
will come later on; you cannot come before. And, in fact, if there was a
creator, existence was already there; otherwise how can the creator
exist?</p><p>But people don't go to such depths. They don't bother about that,
believing in a God who created the world. Why don't you ask who created
God? When did he start to be? His family, his nationality, his race --
any trace? Suddenly he comes and starts creating the world. Such a
stupid idea, and millions have believed in it, and still believe in
it.</p><p>Zen is very clean and clear, saying that there has been no beginning
at all; hence the question of creation does not arise. And there is not
going to be any end; hence the question of anybody destroying it, God or
Devil, does not arise. It is always here, it has always been here, and
it will always be here. It just goes on playing in many forms. It is a
tremendous drama.</p><p>If you understand the fourth --</p><p>that everything comes from nothingness ...</p><p>If you can return to nothingness consciously you have found the
source.</p><p>That's what I call meditation:</p><p>returning consciously to the very source not only of your being</p><p>but of the very cosmos.</p><p>There you find an eternal flame. Things come, things go.</p><p>Waves arise, and waves disappear. But everything remains,</p><p>rooted in nothingness.</p><p>This nothingness is very miraculous because one would think that
things should be rooted in something. But if you ask the Zen masters if
things should be rooted in something, they will simply laugh and ask,
"In what will your something be rooted?"</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 4</p><p>Chapter 1 - How full, emptiness!</p><p>You cannot ask the same question about nothingness. Nothingness
simply means nothingness, there is no question of any roots. It neither
comes nor goes. Nothing happens to it; it simply remains, utterly
silent.</p><p>You touch this nothingness when you are deep in your being, because
that being is already rooted in this nothingness. You are driving your
life, moment to moment, from that nothingness.</p><p>The flowers may not understand from where they have come. The
branches may not know from where they have come. The trunk of a tree may
not know from where it has come, because the roots are hidden
underground. The roots are hidden for security purposes, otherwise you
could be harmed very badly.</p><p>You cannot take even your very intimate friend into your nothingness;
you cannot invite anybody there -- no party! You have to go alone. It is
such a sacred place.</p><p>In the old Jewish tradition ... It is significant to understand,
because Jews, their rabbis, will not be able to give the explanation.
Zen can give an explanation for many things in other religions also,
because it has gone to the very root, it has traveled the whole path. It
has not chosen one path, it has accepted all paths, and still it has
gone beyond all paths. So it knows more than anybody else and yet it is
absolutely innocent because it knows nothing.</p><p>In the great temple of Jerusalem there used to be a festival once a
year. The temple had an inner sanctum, a small room, and only the chief
rabbi was allowed to enter into it. He would enter, close the doors, and
in that silent, small chamber he was allowed to whisper the word</p><p>"God". It has a beauty of its own, why it was done in such a way. To
use the word "God" as a mundane word makes it also like a thing. Jews
have avoided it</p><p>... you can only whisper in silence. Perhaps you don't even have to
whisper; you can simply feel the presence of nothingness.</p><p>Judaism is the only religion which does not write the whole word
"God". They leave the</p><p>"o" out: "G-d". The "o" in between is left out, they don't write it.
It is sacrilegious to pronounce the name of God; something of it is
bound to remain beyond words. In fact, the most important part -- the
middle part -- is missing. You have touched only one side or another
side, but you have not touched the heart of it. In the word also, you
are making it clear that unless you touch the heart of God ... and the
only way is to touch your own heart. You don't know your own heart. Your
heart has roots in the universal heart from where it gets its life. And
as the universal heart withdraws man dies, but the life that was is not
finished. It may move into a new ripple, into a new flower, into a new
cuckoo ... millions are the ways. Or it may remain silent in the ocean
of the cosmos.</p><p>Because it has chosen the fourth, Zen's standpoint is the most
superior, the most delicate, and the most intimate one.</p><p>AN OLD ZEN MASTER SAID:</p><p>TURN YOUR HEART ROUND AND ENTER THE ORIGIN. DO NOT SEARCH FOR</p><p>WHAT HAS SPRUNG OUT OF IT! WHEN YOU HAVE GAINED THE ORIGIN, WHAT</p><p>HAS SPRUNG OUT OF IT WILL COME TO YOU OF ITSELF.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 5</p><p>Chapter 1 - How full, emptiness!</p><p>We are born looking outwards. Our eyes open outwards, our hands reach
outwards, all of our senses are ready to receive the outward vibrations.
But we don't have any sense available which gives us information about
our inner being.</p><p>Meditation is the search for that hidden eye that can see your
origin. It is called the buddha-eye. But a great turning is needed. You
have to close off the world completely, even if just for a single
moment, and give a turn to your whole being, to look inside the well
from where you are coming.</p><p>And don't think about anything else, because this experience of
looking into yourself will explain everything that was a question to
you. Thousands of answers were there, but no answer was able to satisfy
it.</p><p>IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE ORIGIN, THEN PENETRATE YOUR OWN</p><p>ORIGINAL HEART. THIS HEART IS THE SOURCE OF ALL BEINGS IN THE
WORLD</p><p>AND OUTSIDE THE WORLD. WHEN THE HEART STIRS, VARIOUS THINGS
ARISE.</p><p>BUT WHEN THE HEART ITSELF BECOMES COMPLETELY EMPTY, THE VARIOUS</p><p>THINGS ALSO BECOME EMPTY. IF YOUR HEART IS DRIVEN ROUND NEITHER
BY</p><p>GOOD NOR BAD, THEN ALL THINGS ARE JUST AS THEY ARE.</p><p>Zen has no idea of judgment. It never judges that somebody is a
sinner or somebody is a saint. These are only waves; there is no need to
waste your time on waves. If you know the ocean, you will not bother
about the waves. One wave turns in one way, the other in another way,
but they all belong to the same ocean and they all dissolve finally into
the same ocean.</p><p>So the only thing worth consideration is not what is good and what is
bad, but what is the origin from where your heart has come. It is an
existential approach -</p><p>- not theoretical, not philosophical.</p><p>MASTER OTSU, COMMENTING ON THIS EMPTYING OF THE HEART, SAID: THE
HEART BECOMES EMPTY, THE SITUATION QUIET, AND THE BODY JUST</p><p>AS IT IS.</p><p>Everything remains the same, nothing changes. This does not mean that
the man who has approached the very origin of existence becomes somebody
special. Everything remains the same. But on the other hand, everything
starts looking different. Now he can see the beauty of the flower that
you cannot see. His eyes are so fresh that he can see the beauty of a
sunset that you cannot see. Your eyes are so full of dust, you are
hardly able to see. You cannot penetrate to the very origin of a
flower.</p><p>But a man who knows his origin knows the origin of everything. He
never makes any judgment. This is a great contribution to human
consciousness: not to make judgments. That is a very low kind of
morality, a very low kind of religion, which goes on making judgments
about good and bad.</p><p>In Zen everything is, as it is, a manifestation of the cosmic soul.
It has to be loved and respected. It does not matter what the
manifestation is doing. What matters is that the man who is a thief or a
murderer is also coming from the same</p><p>source as you are, and he will be going to the same source as you
are.</p><p>So behind the curtain you will find great saints sharing experiences
with great sinners. On the stage it is one thing; behind the stage it is
totally different. And once you have touched the origin of things, you
have gone behind the stage. On the stage it is all acting. On the stage
it is Osho - The Miracle</p><p>6</p><p>Chapter 1 - How full, emptiness!</p><p>simply drama. Behind the stage it is pure silence, nothingness. A
rest, a relaxation --</p><p>everything has moved into total tranquility.</p><p>WHEN SOMEONE SUCCEEDS IN REACHING THIS POINT, THE MIRROR OF HIS</p><p>HEART SHINES CLEARLY AND HIS NATURE OPENS WIDE AND CLEAR. HE</p><p>LEAVES ERROR AND DOES NOT ATTACH HIMSELF TO TRUTH.</p><p>These are great statements. The day you understand them as your
experience, you will dance with joy.</p><p>Master Otsu is saying that the moment a person enters into the origin
of things, he leaves all dualities behind: truth and untruth, love and
hate. He enters into the oneness of things. He is neither worldly nor
saintly.</p><p>That's why it is very difficult to find an authentic man of
meditation. You will find people who are worldly; you can see them. You
can find very easily people who are other-worldly, saints. They have
renounced the world; that is very easy. The world is so crazy, so
insane, that one wonders why everybody is not renouncing it! The problem
is where to go? If everybody renounces it, everybody will reach to
another place, but the same faces, the same people ... the buses will
start going to Everest, restaurants will have to be opened; everybody is
coming to the hills, renouncing the world.</p><p>There is no way to renounce the world. And there is no point, either.
But that's what all your religions have been valuing the most:
renouncing the world. So there are saints, and those who are still
attached to things are sinners. But for a man of cosmic consciousness
--</p><p>and that's what the ultimate of meditation is -- all waves are just
drama.</p><p>It is a beautiful drama. You cannot take away the sinners; otherwise
it will lose all salt.</p><p>The saints and the sinners both are needed to make the drama. Love
and hate both are needed.</p><p>If everything is goody-goody ... finished! All taste is lost. If
everybody looks alike -- very saintly, very pious -- the world will
become a boredom. It is good that a few people are cheats, a few people
are cutting your pockets. If nobody cuts the pockets, what is the point
of having pockets? To make the drama richer</p><p>...</p><p>Just the other day, Anando brought me news: A man has reported to the
police station that his wife was missing. The police officer asked,
"When did you find that she was missing?"</p><p>He said, "I don't remember. It may be a few weeks, or maybe a few
months. She is certainly missing, but there is no hurry to find
her."</p><p>A great man of insight.</p><p>I have heard another version:</p><p>A man came running into a post office, tears coming down, and he said
to the postmaster,</p><p>"My wife is missing -- find her immediately!" He would not even give
the postmaster a chance to say anything. He was so much in misery and
suffering, and tears rolling down, that the postmaster said finally,
"Listen, this is the post office."</p><p>He said, "I know."</p><p>The postmaster said, "The police station is just opposite, on the
other side of the road."</p><p>The man said, "I know." Osho - The Miracle</p><p>7</p><p>Chapter 1 - How full, emptiness!</p><p>The postmaster said, "If you know, then why are you bothering me? For
half an hour crying and weeping ... Just go to the police station."</p><p>The man said, "Once before it also happened, and I went to the police
station and those idiots brought my wife back! Now I'm not going. You
have to write it down, just for my consolation, that at least I reported
it. To whom I reported it does not matter."</p><p>The postmaster said, "Okay, I can take the report, but that will not
help."</p><p>The man said, "That's what I want, that it should not help. You just
write the report. Those police officers are such idiots. I told them
that there was no hurry, but they brought my wife within six hours and
again the old drama started."</p><p>But it is a beautiful world where wives run away, where husbands run
away, where people forget to come back home, enter into another home and
are gone.</p><p>Rather than making it a miserable place, Zen gives it color. And that
needs a very great heart, to accept that the drama needs many kinds of
people, many kinds of acts, many tragedies, many comedies. There is no
need to make judgments.</p><p>SUCH DETACHMENT FROM EVERYTHING IS WHAT MASTER RINZAI CALLED</p><p>"THE COMPLETE TAKING AWAY OF BOTH, OF MAN AND SITUATION."</p><p>What is the difference between you and the other person? -- a certain
situation. You were born into a different family; that is a situation.
You were educated in a</p><p>different school; that is a situation. What is different between man
and man, man and woman? -- just a situation.</p><p>Rinzai is saying, THE COMPLETE TAKING AWAY OF BOTH, OF MAN AND</p><p>SITUATION. HERE IS EXPERIENCED ABSOLUTE NOT-NESS. He is not</p><p>using the word</p><p>'nothingness' because you misunderstand it. To emphasize that it is
not nothingness, he says it is simply not-ness, it is pure
emptiness.</p><p>... SINCE SELF AND OBJECT ALLOW THEMSELVES TO COME TO NOTHING.</p><p>Everything comes to relax into nothing, and then arises, rejuvenated,
back into some manifestation. The way Zen looks at the world, it does
not make anybody feel guilty; neither does it make anybody feel
superior. The source is the same, the game is the same. Of course,
different players have to play from different sides.</p><p>GENUINE ZEN EXPERIENCE CONSISTS EXCLUSIVELY IN THIS "TAKING</p><p>AWAY OF MAN AND OBJECT." THIS COMPLETE NOT-NESS IS THE ORIGINAL</p><p>PLACE FROM WHICH ALL THINKING AND KNOWING SPRING. BUT EVEN IF ONE</p><p>IS PERMITTED TO SPEAK OF A "PLACE" AT ALL, SUCH TERMINOLOGY IS
ONLY</p><p>PROVISIONAL.</p><p>You cannot call it even a place; it is only space.</p><p>EVEN IF ONE WANTED TO CHARACTERIZE IT AS UNBORN-NESS, OR AS</p><p>NIRVANA, OR AS TRUTH, ONE COULD NEVER HIT IT.</p><p>One has just touched on it. No word can reach to the very heart of
existence.</p><p>IT LIES BEYOND ALL TERMINOLOGY AND EXPRESSION; THINKING CANNOT</p><p>REACH THAT FAR.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 8</p><p>Chapter 1 - How full, emptiness!</p><p>But silence can divulge as much depth as you have courage for. What
words cannot manage to express, your silence can express, your laughter
can express, because laughter is coming from the depth of your heart. It
is just like a flower.</p><p>Words are first put into you just the way computers are fed full of
all the information that they have. Then you can ask them and they will
repeat it. That does not make them very great learned scholars. But that
is what your learned scholars are. They have not a single word of their
own to say.</p><p>The cosmic origin of things is beyond our intellect, our mind, our
words. But in deep silence we reach it. We feel the dance of it, we hear
the music of it, we feel the unknown fragrance of it.</p><p>There is a Zen saying:</p><p>TEN YEARS OF DREAMS IN THE FOREST! NOW ON THE LAKE'S EDGE LAUGHING,
LAUGHING A NEW LAUGH.</p><p>TEN YEARS OF DREAMS IN THE FOREST! -- because a meditator does not
just one day become a meditator; dreams follow, for years. Even if you
go into the deepest forest, those dreams haunt you. But slowly slowly
those dreams settle down because there is no point. You are no more
interested in them; on the</p><p>contrary you simply sit there watching.</p><p>This watchfulness makes you so silent that when sitting by the lake's
edge, laughing ...</p><p>laughing about what? Laughing about the whole world; that you have it
within you and still you are searching for it. LAUGHING A NEW LAUGH. A
meditator laughs a new laugh. Its freshness comes from his depths.</p><p>Another Zen saying:</p><p>FOR TEN YEARS I COULD NOT RETURN; NOW I HAVE FORGOTTEN THE ROAD BY
WHICH I CAME.</p><p>He is saying that he has reached his origins. It took ten years to
find it, and now he has forgotten the road, how to come back -- THE ROAD
BY WHICH I CAME.</p><p>Please, don't you do that! Every day I take you to the very origin of
things, but I don't leave you there long enough. I keep Nivedano alert.
Somebody may forget the way back; then I will be responsible. But
Nivedano has a good drum, and he is finding some other, better
instruments. So in spite of yourself, you are suddenly awake. Before you
know it, you have come back.</p><p>There is not much distance between you as you are and as your
original being is. The difference is so slight -- just a drum beat, a
hit on your head by Master Niskriya, anything can bring you back.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 9</p><p>Chapter 1 - How full, emptiness!</p><p>This Zen master who remained for ten years and could not come back
must have been searching alone, without a master. Otherwise the master
gives you a certain rope; he does not allow you to go beyond that. He
gives you a taste of your being</p><p>-- that is enough -- and a remembrance of it. He takes you through
the rose garden and the fragrance of the roses hangs around your
clothes. That much is enough. You know who you are and your actions
express your sincerity, your every gesture becomes a buddha gesture.
Just two minutes are enough to reach the origin of your being.</p><p>I go on watching: when I say die, I have to watch whether somebody is
really dying.</p><p>Otherwise I will be proved a criminal, that I ordered him to die and
he died. So I have to keep watch. And the only way is, I have to feel
your heart throbbing -- ten thousand hearts throbbing. And my arithmetic
is not good, but somehow I manage. At least up to now I have managed.
One never knows about tomorrow, or even tonight.</p><p>Sardar Gurudayal Singh is laughing, and he is one of the fellows who
may become lost and not come back. He may not care about Nivedano's
drum. He may listen, but may not care.</p><p>But I have other ways also. (SARDAR LAUGHS HEARTILY.)</p><p>Do you want to see my other ways?</p><p>(THE MASTER BEGINS TO MAKE TICKLING GESTURES TOWARDS</p><p>AVIRBHAVA, AS HE DID THE PREVIOUS EVENING, AND WAVES OF LAUGHTER</p><p>RISE AND FALL AS HE "TICKLES" AGAIN AND AGAIN.) This way is</p><p>purely imported -- Hollywood, California. A real buddha! And I have
my substitutes ...</p><p>(HE TURNS TO ANANDO AND PROVOKES MORE LAUGHTER.)</p><p>Nobody can die here. Even if you have died, you will have to laugh at
least. That's why I am at ease in ordering you to die. Otherwise who
orders anybody to die -- and die completely and totally? Because I know
that I have ways to wake you up even if you are dead. Every night I have
to do it. A few people really die.</p><p>And another Zen master:</p><p>HE SEES ONLY THE WINDING OF THE STREAM</p><p>AND THE TWISTING OF THE PATH. HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT ALREADY</p><p>HE IS IN THE LAND OF THE IMMORTALS.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 10</p><p>Chapter 1 - How full, emptiness!</p><p>A tremendously significant statement. You see only misery and
suffering -- all non-essentials. You don't see that on this very earth,
immortal buddhas have moved, lived, loved. You don't see the heights
that human consciousness has reached many, many times.</p><p>You remain confined to very small things.</p><p>At least every evening with me, you have to reach the heights. And
don't get lost; come back down to the marketplace. My whole message is:
Touch the heights of consciousness and bring those heights to the
marketplace.</p><p>Maneesha has asked:</p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>YOU SEEM TO EMBODY THE MIRACLE OF ZEN -- HOW FULL EMPTINESS CAN</p><p>BE!</p><p>Maneesha, there is no end to the fullness of emptiness. Because if
there were a limit, then the emptiness would not be really empty; it
would have boundaries. Total emptiness means the whole cosmos,
unlimited, in your hands. And if, out</p><p>of meditation, you cannot bring a new juice, a fresh fragrance, a new
life and a new laughter, your meditation has not been authentic.</p><p>You played the game but not totally.</p><p>Otherwise ... every night, ten thousand people are becoming buddhas.
When the same buddhas come again they have forgotten what has happened
last night. They wake up and start looking for their rented bicycles.
This is very strange -- buddhas never have used rented bicycles. And so
quickly!</p><p>Just take time, don't be in such a hurry.</p><p>But I am introducing in the world a new kind of buddha who can have a
girlfriend, and can change his girlfriend as many times as he wants,
because we don't take this world seriously.</p><p>So I see my buddhas moving with new girlfriends every day. Nobody
exactly knows ...</p><p>(THE MASTER BEGINS TO "TICKLE" AVIRBHAVA AGAIN, AND WE LAUGH</p><p>ALONG WITH HIM.)</p><p>Maneesha, this is the miracle you are talking about! Another miracle
is ... (HE TURNS TO "TICKLE" ANANDO.)</p><p>I have got only two miracles. But I think two are enough to make ten
thousand buddhas laugh. And they do nothing. They sit so buddha-like.
But still they trigger you.</p><p>And I have got, just behind Maneesha, Stonehead. Now he has cut all
his hair, removed his beard, and left a small Chinese moustache. You all
have to see him in his whole glory.</p><p>Germany has never seen a Zen master ... Do you want to see him in his
full glory?</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 11</p><p>Chapter 1 - How full, emptiness!</p><p>("YES!" WE RESPOND, LAUGHING AND CLAPPING.)

other end of the rope?"</p><p>"Oh, that!" exclaims Og. "Be careful of that one. While the little

AND LATER-DAY TRAINEES IN BUDDHISM SEEM TO HAVE</p><p>DIFFICULTY EVEN IN HAVING A CHANCE TO FIND THEMSELVES AMONG THE</p><p>ATTENDANTS. SOME OF THEM REALIZE THE INNERMOST DEPTHS OF THE</p><p>MASTER, AND OTHERS, NOT.

SAID:</p><p>MY OWN MASTER NEVER EASILY PERMITTED NEW MONKS TO STAY IN HIS</p><p>TEMPLE, USUALLY SAYING, "THOSE, WHO, LACKING IN THE BODHI- MIND,
BEHAVE THEMSELVES MERELY FROM FORCE OF HABIT MUST NOT STAY</p><p>HERE." HAVING TURNED THEM OUT, HE SAID, "THEY ARE LACKING IN THE</p><p>BODHI-SEEKING MIND. WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?

FAR-DISTANT FOREIGN COUNTRY, I AM PERMITTED TO STAY HERE TO</p><p>WORSHIP HIS VENERABLE BODY AND LISTEN TO HIS SERMON! FOOLISH AS I AM,
I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM A GOOD AND FRUITFUL CONNECTION WITH</p><p>HIM. "</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 16</p><p>Chapter 2 - Dissolved, just like ice</p><p>Maneesha, Dogen is dealing with one of the most important aspects of
Zen. His statement is not as exact as it could be, but anyway he comes
very approximately near to the truth.</p><p>He does not mention, and perhaps no Zen master has ever mentioned,
that there are three potentialities. When a seeker comes to a master he
may be only a student, most of them are.</p><p>They are in search of more knowledge because knowledge brings power,
knowledge brings respectability, knowledge brings honor and dignity. But
these are not the true seekers.</p><p>The second category that comes to the master is the disciple. Zen
masters have reached very high as far as human consciousness is
concerned. But they have stopped at the second category of seekers, the
disciple and the master.</p><p>There is another category which Zen is not aware of, because it was
not needed. To be a disciple was enough ... to meditate, to watch the
master, and to create a connection of consciousnesses. It has worked
well for Zen but I can see that something is missing, and that is the
devotee.</p><p>The third category of seekers did not happen in Zen. The masters have
reached to the highest peak, but the disciple cannot reach to the
highest peak unless he becomes a devotee.</p><p>And the difference is great. The disciple is satisfied if he is
connected with the master --</p><p>watches his movements, listens to his words, listens to his silences.
Slowly slowly he starts growing an individuality of his own. He may jump
from disciplehood into mastership.</p><p>Zen knows disciples and masters. But a more ancient tradition in
India, which has almost disappeared, makes it clear that unless a
disciple first becomes a devotee there is no way of becoming a
master.</p><p>And what is the difference between the disciple and the devotee? The
disciple seeks connection, the devotee seeks dissolvement; the disciple
seeks</p><p>individuality, the devotee seeks the ocean. Personality is borrowed,
it has to be dropped; individuality is your own, but if you can manage
to drop it also then the whole ocean is yours. Otherwise, a dewdrop is
beautiful in the sunlight or in the moonlight, but the roaring reality
of the ocean and the eternity of the ocean are missing. The dewdrop has
no song to sing; the ocean has millions of songs to sing and millions
remain unsung.</p><p>Although the dewdrop can reflect the moon as much as the ocean, the
depth of the reflection cannot be more than the circular dimension of
the dewdrop. In the ocean the same moon penetrates to the very depths,
miles deep.</p><p>Being a devotee means dropping even individuality, dropping even the
feeling that, "I am"</p><p>... just merging with the universe. It is the ultimate quantum leap.
From personality to individuality is a very small jump, available to
many, but from individuality to no-individuality is a very rare
occurrence. And that's what makes a disciple a devotee.</p><p>Because Zen tradition knows nothing about the devotee, there is
something missing in it. It brings the individual to realize the truth,
it brings the individual back home; but the separation of the individual
from the master and the separation of the individual from existence
still remain in a very subtle form. The disciple still is. He has not
forgotten himself completely, he has not dropped even his being.</p><p>A devotee is a miracle. He simply disappears into the whole, leaving
behind not even a trace.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 17</p><p>Chapter 2 - Dissolved, just like ice</p><p>Gautam Buddha is reported to have said that the authentic seeker is
just like a bird flying in the sky, leaving no footmarks behind. When
the bird becomes one with the sky ... not only in tune, because in tune
you still remain separate. The disciple is in tune with the master but
they are two different instruments, meeting deeply with each other, but
the separation line is still there. The devotee simply</p><p>disappears, only the master remains. The master himself becomes just
a window for him to jump into the beyond.</p><p>Because the devotee is not at all a part of the Zen tradition ... and
there are reasons why the word has not appeared. The reasons are that
devotees -- the very word 'devotee' has become contaminated with the
idea of God, with worship. To devote yourself, to dedicate yourself, to
surrender yourself ... but all these words are not the essence of the
word 'devotee'. Because of these misconceptions about the devotee, Zen
has not used the word at all -- because there is no God to be devoted to
and there is no worship to be done; you have to be just yourself.</p><p>My own experience is that just to be yourself is great, but not great
enough. There is one step more -- not to be. Let the pine trees stand in
their beauty under the full moon, let the birds sing, let the sun rise
and set, but you will not be found anywhere. You are no more, existence
is. This ultimate step makes the disciple a devotee ... no worship, no
question of any God. And according to me, unless one is a devotee, not
in tune with the universe but one with the universe, he cannot be a
master.</p><p>Hence the master is one of the most miraculous phenomena. He is and
he is not. He is to you, from the outside; he is not at all from the
inside. Inside is pure space. This you have to remember before I talk
about Dogen, because he is talking about the difficulties of the
disciple.</p><p>Dogen wrote:</p><p>NOW, WHEN WE SEE THE FOLLOWERS OF AN ENLIGHTENED ZEN MASTER ...</p><p>In fact a Zen master has no followers. That is the beauty of Zen: he
has lovers, he has people as fellow travelers, but not followers. Others
have followers -- following means imitating, following means preparing
oneself step by step in a discipline. It is more or less creating
yourself in the image of your master, but that again is hypocrisy.</p><p>I will not say, FOLLOWERS OF AN ENLIGHTENED ZEN MASTER. If there are
followers then the master is not enlightened. If the master is
enlightened there are only lovers, fellow travelers. The question of
following does not arise.</p><p>I make this statement with absolute authority, that Dogen has missed
the point.</p><p>He says: ... WE REALIZE THAT THEY HAVE MANY DIFFICULTIES IN
HEARING</p><p>HIS TRUE TEACHINGS. TRUE ASPIRANTS OF BUDDHISM AMOUNT TO TWENTY</p><p>OR THIRTY -- NAY, TO ONE HUNDRED OR TO ONE THOUSAND. IN THIS CASE,
IF</p><p>A MASTER TRIES TO LEAD EVERY ONE OF THEM, HE WILL FIND THE DAYS
AND</p><p>NIGHTS TOO SHORT. FURTHER, THEY HAVE NO EAR FOR HIS TEACHINGS,
HOWEVER HARD HE MAY TRY TO LEAD THEM.</p><p>Dogen does not understand the working of a master. Perhaps these
statements were made by him before he himself became a master. There is
a difficulty, because in those days there was no printing, no writing,
just disciples taking notes. So it is very difficult to know whether it
is Dogen's own mistake or the mistake of the person who was taking the
notes.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 18</p><p>Chapter 2 - Dissolved, just like ice</p><p>But anyway we don't know who took the notes. One thing is certain,
that Dogen must have said something to create the fault.</p><p>First, TRUE ASPIRANTS OF BUDDHISM. He is still talking in terms of
'isms' and Zen is not an 'ism'. Zen is freedom from all 'isms' --
Buddhism included. And aspirants are for the truth, not for Buddhism,
not for Hinduism, not for Christianity. These are not aspirants, these
are conditioned people who are following their conditioning. They may
find a certain solace, a consolation, but they will never find the
truth, because truth is not part of any theology.</p><p>Dogen's statements are very amateurish. TRUE ASPIRANTS is enough;
don't say OF</p><p>BUDDHISM. Why should anybody be an aspirant of Buddhism? Everybody is
a buddha himself. So it is better to say: "Seekers, aspirants, searchers
of one's own being." Why bring theologies in? That is not the Zen
way.</p><p>And he does not know that a master can have thousands of disciples.
He may not know even their names, he may not have even met them -- it
does not matter. He works in a totally different way than things are
done in the ordinary world. He simply creates an atmosphere, he does not
work with "A" and "B" and "C".</p><p>Then naturally, according to Dogen, a man's life is very short; if he
becomes enlightened --</p><p>as Gautam Buddha became enlightened -- at the age of forty ... He
lived up to eighty-two. In forty-two years, if he had worked day and
night without sleeping, without eating ... even then, how many people
would he have been able to bring to the consciousness that he had
achieved?</p><p>And that is a very foolish way, there is no need. The very mastery,
the art of being a master is to create an atmosphere in which things
start happening on their own. What are we doing here? I don't know many
of you, I don't know your names, I don't meet you personally. I simply
create an atmosphere in which you can drown, in which you can drink the
very juice of life. There is no need for me to work on individuals --
that is a very poor and primitive way. I work by creating an atmosphere,
an energy field, and every day that energy field becomes more and more
powerful. Every one of you contributes to it. You are not just on the
side of taking; you are also a giver.</p><p>Here your presence, your consciousness, certainly creates a chain
reaction. Just the man sitting by your side ... you may not know him at
all, but in your silence you meet with him.</p><p>When everybody becomes silent there is simply a lake of buddhahood --
one consciousness, one existence, one dance. You are not in tune with
existence, you are it.</p><p>So, for his first mistake, he thinks that life is too short and a
master cannot work on many people. That is absolutely wrong. A single
master can work on the whole world. And he need not go out of his room;
he can radiate enough energy, invisible rays, to surround the whole
globe.</p><p>Many times it has been reported to me that some sannyasin has come
from New Zealand or some sannyasin has come even from the Soviet Union,
for the reason that he simply saw my picture. A friend had my picture,
and seeing the picture a tremendous longing arose in him somehow to
reach me -- irrational, but life is irrational.</p><p>Somebody has read a few words in a book and those words become a
magnetic force so that he has to come here. Somebody has heard how I
have been condemned, criticized, and thinks, "If so many people and so
many magazines and so many politicians are against this man, there must
be something to him."</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 19</p><p>Chapter 2 - Dissolved, just like ice</p><p>Nobody is opposed on such a vast scale. I cannot enter twenty-one
countries, their parliaments have passed laws.</p><p>Just today I received a beautiful note from Vimal, who has gone to
England. He had taken his girlfriend, who is an Indian, to the British
High Commissioner's office in Bombay. They would not give a visa to the
Indian woman. They interrogated her for hours and finally refused.</p><p>But Vimal is not a person who will accept any refusal so easily. He
asked to see the highest authority. He did not want to deal with an
assistant commissioner; he wanted to see the High Commissioner himself:
on what grounds is he denying a visa just for three weeks?</p><p>The High Commissioner said, "To be frank with you, your girlfriend
has nothing</p><p>-- no bank account, no home, no particular reason why she should come
back to India again."</p><p>Vimal said to him, "Don't be afraid about that. We have not been
saying it to you, but we are Osho Rajneesh's disciples. She has every
reason to be here. She has no reason to be anywhere else."</p><p>And Vimal has written a note to me, "The British Commissioner
immediately gave the visa. He said, 'If she is Osho Rajneesh's disciple,
then there is no</p><p>problem.'"</p><p>It is the first time that my name has been of help -- because that
makes it certain that she will not remain in England. "She can go have a
three week trip, or if you want, three months</p><p>... any time. We were worried that she may not come back. But if she
is a disciple of Osho Rajneesh, there is no worry."</p><p>Life is very strange. They were hiding my name, but they forgot that
my name has to be kept secret if you are coming FROM England. If you are
going TO England it is a different story. The High Commissioner was
perfectly satisfied; there was no question of asking any more about the
woman. She will come back to India.</p><p>I have come across many sannyasins who just heard my name and
something started -- a longing, a desire ... as if a forgotten language
suddenly is remembered. A master does not work on individuals. He
creates an atmosphere and that atmosphere itself goes on becoming every
day richer, more dense. Its pull, its gravitation, goes on bringing new
people from faraway places.</p><p>In Rancho Rajneesh in America ... now even the Oregon newspapers are
accepting the fact that our presence has made Oregon a world-famous
place. In fact the news media -- television, radio, newspapers,
magazines -- they all missed. They had a tremendously beautiful story,
with all the colors of the rainbow, with all the rumors that you can
manage. We gave them so much material and we allowed them to invent
whatever they wanted to invent. We enjoy it anyway, we don't make much
fuss whether it is true or not. We kept the whole news media busy.</p><p>It is almost unbelievable that I was, for two years, the first man
... I was a tourist whose tourist visa had expired years before, and I
was chosen the man of the year in Oregon because I was discussed more
than the president himself.</p><p>Many times my people said to me, "These allegations ... we should
drag them to the court."</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 20</p><p>Chapter 2 - Dissolved, just like ice</p><p>I said, "Stop -- don't bother! Let them make as many allegations as
possible. Help to create rumors yourself! Let the whole of America be
concerned with you." And we made, within five years, the whole of
America concerned.</p><p>Now the politicians are missing me. One of my attorneys came a few
days ago. He said,</p><p>"Now, in Oregon, the politicians are missing you very much." I said,
"Why?"</p><p>He said, "Because you were a good reason for them to collect the
votes of the Oregonians, because they all were against you. Now there is
no reason why they should be chosen." And he added, "The newspapers are
missing you, the television is missing you."</p><p>The man Ed Meese said in a press conference, "All that we want is to
silence Rajneesh absolutely. He should not be heard anywhere, he should
not be seen anywhere. We will close all the doors to his voice."</p><p>Anando has sent him just now ... Here we are, ten thousand
sannyasins, and poor Ed Meese has been kicked out of his Attorney
General's job because he has been found guilty of doing many criminal
acts.</p><p>And Anando, as my secretary, has written to him -- with a photograph
of ten thousand sannyasins, that means twenty thousand hands raised --
saying, "Osho Rajneesh is still being heard -- where are you?" It is
only a question ...</p><p>In the Soviet Union, where it is almost impossible for anybody to
enter, I have my sannyasins. They have never seen me. They meet in
basements. They have been terrorized, harassed, by the Russian
intelligence, their books have been burned. So those poor Russians have
to type the books and, from hand to hand, those books are moving
around.</p><p>Now that America has banned me from entering for five years, Russian
intelligence has relaxed. Before they used to think that I must be in
favor of America and America's capitalism. Now at least that much is
proved -- that America has closed its doors to me.</p><p>Now even sannyasins in the Soviet Union have started feeling that
they can invite me sometime. Things are getting better, the police are
no more harassing them.</p><p>I am sitting here in my room, and I am being discussed, for and
against, in almost all the parliaments of the world. Articles arrive
every day from Holland, from Germany, from England, from places of which
I have not even heard -- small places ... Bolivia. And just now I have
received their congratulations for my birthday. My sannyasins in
Bolivia, in Yugoslavia, in Czechoslovakia ... it is a contagious
phenomenon.</p><p>To be a master is almost like a dangerous disease moving like winds,
like clouds</p><p>... it does not carry a passport, it does not believe in any
boundaries. A master's existence is always universal. His focus cannot
be on individuals. That will take ages to bring enlightenment to the
world. No, it is not a retail work -- it is wholesale. When I make you
every night enlightened it is wholesale.</p><p>And whatever vibrations you are gathering, you will be spreading
without your knowing, wherever you go. I don't make anybody a
missionary. I don't want you to convert anybody. I want you just to be
converted yourself -- converted not to any ideology, converted to your
own truth. And suddenly you will start radiating a fragrance for which
many are thirsty.</p><p>Sannyasins have reported to me that, "It is very strange. We have
dropped the orange, we have dropped the mala just so that nobody
recognizes us," because the governments, the Osho - The Miracle</p><p>21</p><p>Chapter 2 - Dissolved, just like ice</p><p>airports ... everywhere the Americans influence, blackmail, because
they are all indebted to America. The sannyasins say, "It is very
strange. We are immediately recognized, it has made no difference. Even
if we say we don't know who Osho Rajneesh is, they say, 'We know you are
a man concerned with Osho Rajneesh. Your very eyes show it.'"</p><p>Now, I cannot take away my people's eyes. I can give you sunglasses,
but then you will be recognized by your sunglasses. Then nobody else in
the world will be able to wear sunglasses.</p><p>We can have a hilarious time: whoever wears sunglasses is a
sannyasin.</p><p>Dogen does not understand that the work of a master is very subtle,
very fine. And it is not in the realm of the visible, it is in the realm
of the invisible, so you don't see it but you know it is spreading.</p><p>So much fear in politicians of a man who has no nuclear weapons, not
even a vegetable cutting knife ... I have not seen with my own eyes a
vegetable cutting knife. I don't know who cuts my vegetables.</p><p>Why this fear? It seems the very air is ready for me. The young
people around the world are searching for something. They are not
satisfied with their own churches, they are not satisfied with their
religions or their leaders. There is an immense discontent all over the
world. That is the fear of the politicians: that I can catch up with the
youth -- with the young, with the fresh, with the intelligent. It is
better to avoid me. But the more they try to avoid, the more they make
it clear to their people that if these politicians are afraid of a man
who has not done any harm to anybody, then it is worthwhile to go to
that man.</p><p>Half of my people here are from Germany. It is because of the German
politicians who are working in my favor by making laws against me. The
intelligent youth can see that if these politicians are so much afraid
of a man, then it is better to go and not to miss the opportunity.</p><p>A master functions like free air -- it goes on around the earth like
radiation.</p><p>Dogen must have said these things when he was not himself a master.
But a few points of what he is saying are, by chance, important. TRUE
ASPIRANTS -- I drop off the OF</p><p>BUDDHISM. A true aspirant does not remain stuck being a student
because as a student he can only be burdened with borrowed knowledge. He
can see that it is not his experience. A true aspirant wants to know
things as his own experience. He immediately becomes a disciple.</p><p>But the disciple has a few difficulties; it depends on both the
master and the disciple how great those difficulties will be. First,
THEY HAVE NO EAR FOR HIS TEACHINGS.</p><p>According to me, there are no teachings, but only a presence. You
don't need</p><p>ears, you need a heart which can drink the presence of a master.</p><p>And he is saying, THEY HAVE NO EAR FOR HIS TEACHINGS, HOWEVER
HARD</p><p>HE MAY TRY TO LEAD THEM. Sheer nonsense! A master never tries hard.
When a thing can be done very easily, only idiots try hard. And when you
understand the way an energy phenomenon works it is only a question of
triggering. It is not a hard job. It is the most easy job, otherwise I
would not have chosen it.</p><p>I am myself an example: a lazy man who has never done anything. I saw
that it seems enlightenment is perfectly in tune with laziness and I
immediately became enlightened. I did not have second thoughts. For
thirty years I have been enlightened and not for a single Osho - The
Miracle</p><p>22</p><p>Chapter 2 - Dissolved, just like ice</p><p>moment I have doubted. In fact I am so lazy I will not doubt;
doubting also takes effort. And once I have become enlightened, why
unnecessarily bother?</p><p>You go on doing hard things. You become enlightened, you become
unenlightened. And next day when you see me you again remember that you
are a buddha. In this hall only buddhas sit. It is so easy to be silent,
it is so easy to be watchful; it is not an arduous thing. But all old
masters made it seem like a very arduous thing.</p><p>It is true that very few have the courage to open their hearts so the
master can pour himself into them. But it is not a question of any
teachings; no master worth the name has any teachings. He certainly has
some insights to share. He does not argue, he does not want to convince
you. He has no investment in convincing you. He is not interested in
converting you to be a follower. It is his joy to share the bliss he
has, because the more he shares it, the more he has. It is not out of
compassion; it is out of a simple understanding that the more you share
your joy, the more there is. It is a strange arithmetic: the more you
give, the more is received by your heart from the unknown sources of
existence.</p><p>Dogen is certainly very immature. BUT WHEN THEY GIVE EAR TO HIM,</p><p>HIS</p><p>SERMON IS ALREADY FINISHED. That is true. If the master is only
concerned with teachings, then by the time the person is ready to listen
to him the sermon is over. But the authentic master is a teaching
himself. He simply provokes in you a synchronicity. He brings you closer
to his heart, his being, because that is the door to the universal
heart. It is an alchemical transformation; it is not a scholarly
job.</p><p>WHEN AN OLD ZEN MASTER LAUGHS LOUDLY, CLAPPING HIS HANDS, BEGINNERS
AND LATER-DAY TRAINEES IN BUDDHISM SEEM TO HAVE</p><p>DIFFICULTY EVEN IN HAVING A CHANCE TO FIND THEMSELVES AMONG THE</p><p>ATTENDANTS.</p><p>When the old Zen master laughs ... if you start thinking about why he
is laughing you have missed. He is simply enjoying it. And if you
understand the point, you should join him in his laughter. You will find
that you are laughing in a very fresh and new way. You have laughed
before; it was very ordinary. This time it seems to be very precious. It
has reflected the laughter of the master also. It has joined hands with
a tremendous energy, it has reflected the full moon.</p><p>Your laughter has been a laughter in dark tunnels. You have laughed
because you wanted to hide your misery. You laughed because you did not
want to expose your sufferings to others. Your laughter was a defensive
device.</p><p>But when a master laughs it has nothing to do with anything to hide.
On the contrary, he is laughing because he can see his buddhahood and he
can see your buddhahood, and he cannot believe how you buddhas can
manage to be in suffering. This is the most unbelievable thing: that a
buddha is in misery. Carrying essentially the buddhahood, how can you be
in misery?</p><p>How can you be in suffering? How can you be dry and not
blossoming?</p><p>Zen is a participation with the master's being. He laughs and you
join in his laughter, not even bothering why he is laughing. The
question "why?" is the most stupid question. Why are the roses so
beautiful? Why are the clouds today</p><p>silent? Why do the bamboos go on growing?</p><p>Everything simply is. At the moment the master feels like laughing he
does not ask himself why. His laughter is just like a flower. The bush
does not ask, "Why has this rose arisen in me?" The bush enjoys the
dance of the rose, its beauty and its fragrance, without any Osho - The
Miracle</p><p>23</p><p>Chapter 2 - Dissolved, just like ice</p><p>questioning. Existence has no rationality in it. It is beyond reason,
hence there is no question of any teaching. The question is only of
sharing.</p><p>SOME OF THEM REALIZE THE INNERMOST DEPTHS OF THE MASTER, AND</p><p>OTHERS, NOT. SOME HEAR THE CORE OF THE MASTER'S ENLIGHTENMENT, AND
OTHERS, NOT.</p><p>You can see the statement seems to be a footnote by a disciple,
because a master does not speak about great things as if he has heard
about them. He has seen them. He is talking about things that may be
happening. Some people hear the master and some people don't hear.</p><p>TIME FLIES FASTER THAN AN ARROW; LIFE IS MORE TRANSIENT THAN A
DEWDROP. SOME MAY HAVE THE MASTER, BUT REGRET THAT THEY CANNOT</p><p>HEAR HIS TEACHINGS. SOME WISH TO LISTEN TO HIS TEACHINGS, BUT
REGRET</p><p>THAT THEY CANNOT SEE THE MASTER HIMSELF.</p><p>Unfortunately, Dogen is still not a master. I have just finished a
series on Dogen. Those were the statements when he must have become a
master. But these statements, without any doubt, show that he has taken
notes but has no authority of his own. A master speaks with authority,
the authority that comes out of his own experience.</p><p>ON ANOTHER OCCASION, DOGEN SAID:</p><p>MY OWN MASTER NEVER EASILY PERMITTED NEW MONKS TO STAY IN HIS</p><p>TEMPLE.</p><p>Now it is impossible for a master to do such an unkind act. Everybody
has to begin someday. Everybody is new ... even those who are old
disciples started one day as new disciples. Now, not to permit the new
monks to stay in the temple is sheer unkindness, and that is not a sign
of a master. Perhaps Dogen has stayed with a teacher.</p><p>And when he rejected people, USUALLY SAYING, "THOSE, WHO, LACKING IN
THE</p><p>BODHI-MIND, BEHAVE THEMSELVES MERELY FROM FORCE OF HABIT MUST</p><p>NOT STAY HERE." HAVING TURNED THEM OUT, HE SAID, "THEY ARE
LACKING</p><p>IN THE BODHI-SEEKING MIND. WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO? SUCH
FELLOWS</p><p>ONLY DISTURB OTHERS."</p><p>Not only was Dogen not a master at the time these words were written,
his master also was not a master.</p><p>The very miracle of the master is to transform the disciple. I cannot
conceive that a master will reject anyone. The very foundation of Zen is
that everybody is a buddha, whether he knows it or not. The function of
the master is very easy: just to help the person to remember his
self-nature. There is nowhere one has to go, no discipline has to be
enforced, no self-torture ... just a silent searching within oneself.
And the master creates the atmosphere.</p><p>You see the miracle every day. The new person comes and as he joins
in this energy field he becomes as old as you are. His laughter is as
deep as yours. Perhaps one day he may hesitate, but the next day he will
see that everybody is</p><p>laughing -- "Why should I hesitate?"</p><p>Perhaps one day he will not die, but when he sees another day that
everybody here dies and comes back, then there is no fear in dying ...
one can die.</p><p>The newcomer becomes very soon an old disciple, just within days. I
can see when the newcomer for the first time enters the Buddha Hall he
is hesitant, worried what is going to Osho - The Miracle</p><p>24</p><p>Chapter 2 - Dissolved, just like ice</p><p>happen, cannot understand how he is going to do gibberish. But any
child can do gibberish, it doesn't need any training. From the very
first moment you are almost trained. Gibberish needs no training, nor
does laughter need any training.</p><p>If you can do the gibberish you are cleansing your mind of all kinds
of dust that goes on gathering. And as the mind becomes silent ... there
is nowhere to go other than inwards. All roads are forgotten, there
remains a single one-way traffic.</p><p>Just for a day or two you may hesitate to go that much inside. Who
knows whether you will be able to come back or not? That's the whole
purpose of creating an energy field -- so that you can see that so many
people are coming and going, becoming enlightened, unenlightened. It is
a playful, joyful exercise; there is nothing to be worried about, you
can go as deep as you want. And when everybody else is going, in that
tremendous storm it is so easy to join. Alone you may find it difficult
to do gibberish, but when ten thousand people go simply with their
wings, not knowing Chinese but speaking Chinese, not knowing what they
are saying but saying it very emphatically, not bothering at all who is
listening ...</p><p>Nobody is listening, so you can say anything you want, you are not
going to offend anybody. There is nobody other than you. Such an
absolute freedom you will not find even when you are alone. And
everybody helps to trigger everybody else. When you see your neighbor is
going nuts the resistance drops. Everybody is going nuts and everybody
is enjoying it so much, why not take a little step and be nuts, only for
two minutes?</p><p>That will make you saner than you have ever been, because you throw
so much garbage that you were holding. Do you think your gibberish is
coming from the sky? You are carrying all that garbage, throw it! And
don't be worried that, "What will the others say?" They are throwing
their garbage, nobody is interested in anybody else. Although thousands
of people are doing it, everybody is doing it on his own.</p><p>Just one thing I have to warn you: don't sit silently when people are
throwing garbage, because that garbage tends to find new spaces again,
some new house. So outdo each other, don't be worried; it is a great
competitive phenomenon. If you are just a little polite you are in a
danger. It is not a question of being polite, because people are
throwing all kinds of poisons.</p><p>To keep their poisons from entering in you, you have to be on top of
it. Such a joy, and with no ticket! You will not have such a joy even in
a madhouse!</p><p>Just do it totally, enthusiastically. Don't be bothered whether it is
Arabic or Hebrew or Chinese, you are allowed to speak any language that
you don't know. Just avoid the language that you do know, because the
language that you do know will not bring your nonsense out, it will be
very grammatical.</p><p>Just be careful that you are not writing a meaningful poetry or
prose. Meaning is not at all the requirement. Just for two minutes give
an opportunity to your existence to be meaningless.</p><p>And you will be immensely shocked to know that just within two
minutes you become so light, so ready to enter into silence.</p><p>A master's function is not to reject anybody, because anybody who is
coming is a buddha in disguise, you have just to help him to discover
his buddhahood. He knows in his deepest being but he has forgotten the
way. Meditation is just to help him to find the way. And the way is not
very long, it is very short. From the head to the heart how many inches?
From the heart to the being how many inches? And from the being to the
universal being ... just a single step. The reality is so close to you,
you are just standing on the boundary of it.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 25</p><p>Chapter 2 - Dissolved, just like ice</p><p>The master -- any master worth his salt -- will not reject anybody,
because to reject anybody is to reject a buddha. He may be hiding
himself, he may be thinking himself somebody else, but it is a great joy
to remind him.</p><p>The master is just a reminder.</p><p>Certainly Dogen was not with a master, because that master used to
say, "Because they are not yet buddhas, I will not accept them." That is
almost like telling a sick person, "The doctor will not accept you
because you are sick. When you are healthy come back!"</p><p>When one is healthy one does not come back to the doctor.</p><p>You are all buddhas, whether you know it or not ... but I know it, so
it is only a question of creating a certain climate in which you also
become part of the knowing that I am ready to share with you.</p><p>DOGEN CONTINUED: SEEING AND PERSONALLY HEARING THIS FACT, I SAID</p><p>TO MYSELF: "LIVING AS THEY ARE, IN THIS COUNTRY, WHAT SIN OR CRIME
IN</p><p>THEIR PREVIOUS EXISTENCE, PREVENTS THEM FROM LIVING WITH MY</p><p>MASTER? "</p><p>Now he is thinking that the master is right, and these fellows who
are being rejected must have committed some grave sins in their past
lives, that's why the master is not accepting them. The truth is, the
master is not the master.</p><p>There is a Tibetan story ... An old master refused his whole life to
accept any disciple. His name became more and more famous, people from
all parts of Tibet used to come to him to be accepted as a disciple. It
had become almost a craziness in all the seekers to see who was going to
be accepted first. But he never accepted anyone.</p><p>But on the day he was dying he simply called his servant and told
him, "Just go to the marketplace and tell whoever wants to be a disciple
that I am ready, come!</p><p>-- because today I am going to die."</p><p>Even the servant could not believe, "Has he gone insane or senile or
what? Because his whole life he has been refusing -- even kings had been
rejected -- and now he is saying, 'Go to the marketplace ... tell
anybody!'"</p><p>The servant said, "Are you in your senses when you are saying
this?"</p><p>The master laughed, he said, "Don't waste time, because this evening
is my last evening. I was rejecting the disciples up to now because I
was not a master. Just this morning as the sun was rising I became the
master, I became enlightened. Now I can see the buddhahood of everyone.
So don't be worried, just go! Go around the town and declare, 'Whoever
wants to become a disciple, come soon, the master will not be available
tomorrow.'"</p><p>People could not believe the servant, they thought, "It must be some
kind of joke</p><p>-- that old fellow has rejected even kings."</p><p>One man's wife had died and he was thinking, "What to do now?"
Getting married again meant getting into another tragedy. Somehow
existence has saved him, one tragedy has ended</p><p>... but sitting without doing anything looks crazy. And he thought,
"What is the problem? The old man is going to die tonight. If he can
make me enlightened today there is no harm, and tomorrow I will be free
to choose whether I want to remain enlightened or not."</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 26</p><p>Chapter 2 - Dissolved, just like ice</p><p>So a few people ... somebody was there on a holiday, somebody was
unemployed and just sitting because there was no job -- thirteen people
in all. The servant brought a very strange company. One man was going to
commit suicide but he thought, "It is better first to become
enlightened, suicide can be done afterwards."</p><p>One man was a known thief; he thought, "It is a good opportunity, it
must be a great gathering. In a big gathering you can cut a few pockets,
there is no harm in it, and if you happen to become enlightened ..."</p><p>Nobody thought about it, and nobody took it seriously, but they had
some free time ... The servant went inside the cave where the old master
lived and he said, "I have brought thirteen people, but I cannot say
they are aspirants. They are just a useless lot, I know every one of
them. One was determined to commit suicide, I told him, 'You can commit
afterwards, what is the hurry?' One is a thief at night, so in the day
he is free. I am ashamed," the servant said, "to bring this lot, but
what can I do? You told ..."</p><p>The master said, "There is no problem. Bring each one of them,
because they are all buddhas."</p><p>And he called that random selection of thirteen and he said to them,
"You are all buddhas.</p><p>I was refusing up to now because I was not enlightened myself, and I
could not accept a disciple because that would be a deception. This
morning I have become a buddha and this evening I am going to disappear
into the universe. Meanwhile, if any of you want to share my being, just
sit silently around me."</p><p>They looked at each other ... whether to sit around him or not? But
now that they had come so far into the forest, into the mountains, they
thought, "It is worth trying, and anyway he is not asking any fee or
anything."</p><p>The story is ... the man died and those thirteen people became
enlightened, because when an enlightened master dies he radiates
tremendous energy around himself. They had entered into the cave very
ordinary people, they came out of the cave brilliant buddhas.</p><p>Dogen must have been in the company of a man who himself was not a
master but a pretender. Because he was accepted by the master he thinks,
UNDER WHAT A LUCKY STAR I WAS BORN THAT, COMING FROM A FAR- DISTANT
FOREIGN COUNTRY, I AM PERMITTED TO STAY HERE TO</p><p>WORSHIP HIS VENERABLE BODY AND TO LISTEN TO HIS SERMON! FOOLISH
AS</p><p>I AM, I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM A GOOD AND FRUITFUL CONNECTION
WITH</p><p>HIM.</p><p>You don't make a fruitful connection with a master. In fact, either
you dissolve into the master or you remain yourself. 'Connection' is a
wrong word. Connection means that the two remain two; they just found a
way of relating to each other that they call a connection. I will not
say that you are connected with me or I am connected with you. Here
there is only one consciousness!</p><p>You have to understand that to be with a master is not to be
connected, it is to be dissolved, just like ice dissolves.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 27</p><p>Chapter 2 - Dissolved, just like ice Shiki wrote:</p><p>MIDNIGHT SOUND -- LEAP UP:</p><p>A FALLEN MOON FLOWER.</p><p>He must be meditating. These haikus are expressions of certain
silences, sounds made out of silences.</p><p>MIDNIGHT SOUND -- LEAP UP: A FALLEN MOON FLOWER.</p><p>They are not to be understood the way we understand poetry. Kikaku
has written:</p><p>FULL AUTUMN MOON -- ON THE STRAW MAT,</p><p>PINE SHADOW.</p><p>In a certain silence you start feeling yourself part of the world ...
the autumn moon, the straw mat, the pine shadow. It does not matter what
it is, it has become part of you, you have become part of it.</p><p>A haiku by Basho:</p><p>HARVEST MOON:</p><p>AROUND THE POND I WANDER AND THE NIGHT IS GONE.</p><p>Have you even seen night going? Very few people even become aware of
things which are happening every day. Have you ever seen the evening
coming? The midnight and its song?</p><p>The sunrise and its beauty? We are behaving almost like blind people.
In such a beautiful world we are living in small ponds of our own
misery. It is familiar, so even if somebody wants to pull you out, you
struggle. You don't want to be pulled out of your misery, of your
suffering. Otherwise there is so much joy all around, you have just to
be aware of it and to become a participant, not a spectator.</p><p>Philosophy is speculation, Zen is participation. Participate in the
night leaving, participate in the evening coming, participate in the
stars and participate in the clouds; make participation your lifestyle
and the whole existence becomes such a joy, such an ecstasy. You could
not have dreamt of a better universe.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 28</p><p>Chapter 2 - Dissolved, just like ice Question 1</p><p>Maneesha has asked:</p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>YOU SEEM TO BE THROWING US BACK TO OURSELVES MORE AND MORE</p><p>LATELY, REMINDING US THAT YOU HAVE DISAPPEARED, SO THERE IS NO
ONE</p><p>TO RELATE TO.</p><p>BY WHAT MAY WE GAUGE IF WE HAVE A "GOOD AND FRUITFUL" CONNECTION,
WHEN WE ARE CONNECTING WITH NO ONE?</p><p>Maneesha, don't commit the same mistake that Dogen committed. There
is no need of any connection, because connection means you are separate;
drop all ideas of connecting. Just like a wave disappears into the
ocean, let this place be an ocean where you all disappear.</p><p>You cannot have any connection with me, because I am not there. But
you can dissolve into the same silence and the same space where I used
to be once; where for thirty years I have not been. If you want to enter
into an uninhabited house, it is up to you. It is dilapidated, but if
you want to enter the space ... the walls may have fallen, the roof may
have fallen, but the space is still there and has been always there.
When the walls were standing, it was there; now the walls are not, it is
still there. You cannot connect with it but you can join, you can
participate.</p><p>Remember, Dogen's thought was not a mature thought of a master. Your
question has arisen out of Dogen's GOOD AND FRUITFUL CONNECTION with the
master. With the master you don't have any connection at all, because
the master is the name of an absence. He is no more! Just an open sky
... what connection can you have with the open sky? You can disappear
into it, but it will be participation, and only participation is
significant.</p><p>Before we enter into this evening's meditation, into a great
participation, dissolving ourselves into an ocean of consciousness ...

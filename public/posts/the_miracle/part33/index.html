Osho - The Miracle 65\nChapter 5 - You must see for yourself 5\nYou must see for yourself\n6 August 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium OUR BELOVED MASTER,\nDOGEN WROTE:\nSUCCESSIVE PATRIARCHS PERSONALLY TRANSMITTED THE DHARMA FROM MASTER TO DISCIPLE. WITHOUT THE PERSONAL TRANSMISSION, NOT A SINGLE PATRIARCH, MASTER OR DISCIPLE, COULD BE A BUDDHA OR A PATRIARCH.\nIT IS JUST AS IF WE WERE MAKING INNUMERABLE SMALL RIVERS JOIN A GREAT ONE, OR KEEPING THE LIGHT FROM GOING OUT, MAKING COUNTLESS\nLIGHTS ONE AFTER ANOTHER: EVENTUALLY, THEY BECOME ONE. AND THERE\nIS NO GAP IN THE FUNCTION OF THE TRANSMISSION BETWEEN MASTER AND\nDISCIPLE.\nSO SUCCESSIVE PATRIARCHS SPENT THEIR DAILY LIFE FACE-TO- FACE WITH\nSAKYAMUNI BUDDHA AND WATCHED BY HIS FACE. HOW MANY DAYS THEY\nHAD PASSED, I DON'T KNOW. WE SHOULD THINK CALMLY AND BE GLAD OF\nTHIS. THEIR EYE AND FACE ARE THE BUDDHA'S BECAUSE THEY MADE BOWS\nTO THE BUDDHA'S FACE AND TRANSFERRED HIS EYE INTO THEIR OWN, AND\nVICE VERSA.\nIT IS THROUGH THE TRANSMISSION THAT THE EYE AND FACE HAD BEEN\nINCESSANTLY TRANSMITTED TILL NOW.\nTHERE IS NO GAP IN THE TRANSMISSION BETWEEN MASTER AND DISCIPLE, JUST AS ONE VINE COILS ROUND ANOTHER; THAT IS TO SAY, WE OPEN OUR\nEYES AND PRESENT THEM WITH THEMSELVES, THEY RECEIVE THEMSELVES.\nTHE SAME CAN ALSO BE SAID OF OUR FACE, MIND AND BODY.\nUNLESS A DISCIPLE SEES HIS MASTER, HE CANNOT BE SAID TO BE A DISCIPLE; UNLESS A MASTER SEES HIS DISCIPLE, HE CANNOT BE A MASTER.\nBOTH OF THEM HAVE GOT THE TRANSMISSION AND SUCCEEDED TO THE\nDHARMA BY SEEING EACH OTHER. THAT IS AN APPEARANCE OF THE\nTRANSMISSION OF THE PATRIARCHS. THEREFORE, THEY COULD DIRECTLY\nTOUCH THE BUDDHA'S FINE FACE.\nAT THE TIME OF THE TRANSMISSION, OUR FACE WILL CHANGE\nCOMPLETELY. THE SKIN ITSELF WILL BE A GREAT MIRROR OF THE BUDDHAS, WHICH HAS NO FLAW INSIDE OR OUT. THE GREAT MIRROR GIVES THE\nTRANSMISSION TO THE GREAT MIRROR ITSELF. THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN\nCORRECTLY GIVEN EYES TRUE ENOUGH TO SEE SAKYAMUNI BUDDHA PERSONALLY, ARE MORE INTIMATE WITH HIM THAN HE IS WITH HIMSELF.\nEVERYONE, REGARDLESS OF SELF AND OTHERS, WHO SEES THE CORRECT\nOsho - The Miracle 66\nChapter 5 - You must see for yourself\nTRANSMISSION OR THE REAL STUDY OF THIS NEW TRANSMISSION OF THE\nTATHAGATA SHOULD PRESERVE IT CAREFULLY.\nManeesha, before I enter into the serious statements of a scholarly Dogen, I would like Avirbhava first to inaugurate.\nIt is not a bear, as I said yesterday -- because around the world I have so many cases against me, accusing me of hurting people's religious feelings. And the bear is worshipped by men.\nIt is really a pig. I had to ask Anando to research whether somebody's heart feelings would be hurt if we inaugurate the Museum of the Ancient Dead Gods with a pig. Avirbhava is going to be the Director General. She is completely ready -- with the ears of a pig, and a tail too.\n(AVIRBHAVA IS DRESSED IN PIG EARS AND A CURLY TAIL.) About pigs:\n\"In the ancient world pigs were considered the embodiment of the 'Corn Spirit', Osiris. He was the great Egyptian god of the underworld and judge of the dead.\nIn Greece pigs were sacred to Demeter, the goddess of the fruitful soil and agriculture.\nAnd today they are considered sacred in New Guinea.\nIn China the pig is considered a great delicacy and, as in many other countries in the past too, was traditionally served at banquets and feasts, notably marriage ceremonies. While people ate the roasted pork, they could view the stuffed pig in the center of the banquet table.\nGreat care was always taken to choose a pig's head that had a pleasing face.\nPigs were particularly popular at marriages because they represented virtue and fertility.\nGenerally, in China, pigs are venerated because they represent good fortune.\"\nSo it is absolutely appropriate for Avirbhava to inaugurate the museum with her own hands.\nAvirbhava, bring your pig ... and inaugurate!\n(AVIRBHAVA PLACES A CUDDLY SOFT PINK PIG ON THE PODIUM AND IT\nPROCEEDS TO WADDLE ACROSS THE MARBLE IN FRONT OF THE MASTER'S\nFEET, MAKING GRUNTING NOISES AS ITS SNOUT AND TAIL\nWRIGGLE.) That is good.\nNow we can turn to the serious matter.\nEven this inauguration will hurt many people's religious beliefs, so there will be a few more cases. But this has been the right ancient god with which to inaugurate this museum, where we are going to collect all the dead gods that have been worshipped by a stupid humanity.\nBuddhas have been forced to worship pigs and nobody has objected. Stones, monkeys, elephants -- you name it, they have all been worshipped somewhere or other. But nowhere in the whole history of mankind has man been given the dignity of a god. I am for the first time giving you the dignity of a god, and I want you to make a plaything of all the so-called gods Osho - The Miracle\n67\nChapter 5 - You must see for yourself\nworshipped by humanity. It is such a degradation, such a humiliation. But man has accepted slavery without revolting against it.\nIf the crowd was worshipping the pig they followed the crowd, because the crowd gave them security and coziness and they had not the courage to revolt. Our museum will be specially devoted to all those idiots who have worshipped animals rather than searching for their own super-human consciousness, their own buddha; looking into mosques and synagogues and temples rather than looking into themselves.\nIt will create legal problems, but that does not matter. I have faced legal problems my whole life. I tremendously enjoy the stupidity of the judiciary around the world. They are still protecting those people whose feelings are hurt if you say anything about the pigs. In the name of religion all kinds of nonsense has been forced on man's mind.\nMy basic function is to take away all this nonsense from you so you can come out in your full glory -- a full moon, a buddha, sufficient unto yourself. I don't teach any prayer, I simply teach exploration of the inner world. There is the treasure; not in the scriptures, as Dogen is saying.\nDOGEN WROTE:\nSUCCESSIVE PATRIARCHS PERSONALLY TRANSMITTED THE DHARMA FROM MASTER TO DISCIPLE.\nIt is a half truth, and a half truth is more dangerous than a lie. A lie is at least complete.\nHalf truths are very dangerous because they hide the lie behind them, so on the\nsurface it looks as if what is projected is true.\nWhat he is saying -- that SUCCESSIVE PATRIARCHS PERSONALLY TRANSMITTED THE DHARMA FROM MASTER TO DISCIPLE -- has a\nlittle truth in it.\nThat has been so with most of the masters, that they have received the essence, the experience, in the presence of a master. It has been a transmission between two energies. But it is not an absolute principle that he is making:\nWITHOUT THE PERSONAL TRANSMISSION NOT A SINGLE PATRIARCH, MASTER OR DISCIPLE COULD BE A BUDDHA OR A PATRIARCH.\nThis is so obviously stupid -- because who was the master of Gautam Buddha himself?\nFrom where did he get the transmission?\nAccording to Dogen he needed to have a master -- but he had none. It is only a half truth.\nBut the other half is more important, for the simple reason that you may not find a master, but the universal spirit is always available everywhere.\nThe really courageous people simply take the jump into the universal being without being pushed by a master. It simply depends on your courage.\nTo be a buddha is your birthright. Just a little courage and you can declare yourself a buddha. But the mind hesitates, the mind thinks a thousand and one things -- what will happen to my smoking? What about the girlfriend? And what about the bank balance?\nThese small things I allow you to have. You can be a buddha and smoke -- that will just simply show that you are a stupid buddha! But stupid or not stupid, nobody can take away your buddhahood. You can have a girlfriend -- even Sardar Gurudayal Singh is having girlfriends and he is a well-known buddha, ancient. I don't think he himself knows how old he Osho - The Miracle\n68\nChapter 5 - You must see for yourself\nis! But there is no time for him to get old. Girlfriends continuously keep him so engaged, he has no time to grow old. One needs time to grow old.\nI allow you every concession that you want except unawareness; that I cannot allow because that is fundamental to buddhahood. If you are alert and aware and conscious there is no need of any master. Universal energy itself transmits the light, the arrow that penetrates to your very center, and you become connected with the whole.\nA master is a small window from which you can see the starry sky. But that does not mean that first you need a window, only then you can see the starry night. Why don't you come out of the door?\nMulla Nasruddin died ... his grave still exists in Iran. He used to carry his door wherever he would go, and people would ask, \"What is the matter? Why are you carrying that board?\nHave you become a Christian?\" But even Christ was carrying only the cross, not a board. \"Is it some improvement on the cross?\"\nHe said \"No, it is just a security measure. Nobody can enter into my house except through the door. So I carry the door.\"\nWhen he died his disciples wondered what to do about the door. He had left a written will in which he mentioned it: \"Just put the door in front of my grave, lock it and put the keys in my hand inside the grave.\"\nThey are still there, the door and the grave; and the skeleton must have the keys. He is saying, \"If the door is closed and the keys are with me, nobody can disturb my sleep until the judgment day, nobody can enter into the grave.\" He has taken security measures. Even after death, the door is locked. You may think it seems to be utter foolishness, but the man was laughing about you in all his acts, all his statements.\nThis act is also simply laughing at your stupidity. What do you think about your security, your bank balance? You can go bankrupt. What do you think of your\nsecurity, your husband, your wife? If either of you is intelligent enough, he will escape.\nThere is no security. Even if you carry the door there is no security; in fact it makes you more vulnerable. Thieves don't bother about entering through the door. In fact they never enter through the door; they just make a hole in the wall on their own accord.\nBut the most hilarious part is ... one cold winter night a thief entered into Mulla Nasruddin's house. Mulla Nasruddin opened one eye and looked at the thief. The thief started trembling -- a man asleep with one eye open? Now he can neither go in, nor even get out. He was so much afraid, but Mulla said, \"Don't be worried, I'm coming with you.\"\nHe said, \"Where?\"\nMulla said, \"Into the house where you are going.\" The thief said, \"You seem to be mad! I am a thief!\"\nMulla said, \"I don't care who you are. For thirty years I have been looking around in this house, and I haven't found anything. Now let us have a partnership\n-- whatever is found we split fifty-fifty. You came at the right time, because I was becoming discouraged.\"\nThe thief said, \"My God!\" Osho - The Miracle\n69\nChapter 5 - You must see for yourself\nBut he had to go in, and there was nothing. Mulla followed him with his lamp to show him the way everywhere. The thief wanted to escape somehow, because with the lamp Mulla would see his face. Tomorrow the whole city would know that he is a thief.\nMulla said, \"Don't be worried, that's why I had opened only one eye. I'm not looking at you. My concern is our partnership.\"\nHe said, \"What partnership? There is nothing to be found.\"\nHe said, \"That's what I was trying to tell you, but you wouldn't listen.\" The thief said, \"I want to go!\"\nNasruddin said, \"Where?\" \"I'm going to my house.\"\nNasruddin said, \"I'm also coming. Partners should live together!\" The thief said, \"My God, this is a difficulty. I have a wife.\"\nNasruddin said, \"Don't be worried about that, I will take care of her. You just do your job and I will take care of your wife.\"\nThis man whose house was empty was carrying the door all around, wherever he was going, making a statement in his own way. The man was of immense intelligence. He is saying that it is only a door and nothing else. Just look through the door and the whole sky is open. By carrying the door he was saying that he is a master, a door to the divinity. But he was a unique person.\nDogen is still a scholar. I wonder how he could not see the simple point when he said: WITHOUT THE PERSONAL TRANSMISSION, NOT A SINGLE PATRIARCH, MASTER OR DISCIPLE, COULD BE A BUDDHA OR A PATRIARCH.\nWhat about the first buddha? And if it can happen to Gautam Buddha without any master, why can it not happen to anybody else?\nTo become enlightened is everybody's birthright, it is not a monopoly of Buddha's. These statements show that Dogen is still learning scriptures. He's not a buddha yet.\nHe became a buddha finally, after he had gone unnecessarily astray carrying the load of Buddhist scriptures. Finally, when he got finished and fed up with the scriptures and dropped them, he was surprised to realize that from the very beginning there was no need to search.\nYou are it. The seeker is the goal. If you go on seeking other goals, you are going away from yourself. Seeking has to stop.\nIT IS JUST, says Dogen, AS IF WE WERE MAKING INNUMERABLE SMALL\nRIVERS JOIN A GREAT ONE, OR KEEPING THE LIGHT FROM GOING OUT, MAKING COUNTLESS LIGHTS ONE AFTER ANOTHER: EVENTUALLY, THEY\nBECOME ONE.\nPartly he is right, but only partly. But buddhas don't make partial statements. Their statements are categorically absolute.\nAND THERE IS NO GAP IN THE FUNCTION OF THE TRANSMISSION BETWEEN\nMASTER AND DISCIPLE.\nOsho - The Miracle 70\nChapter 5 - You must see for yourself\nSO SUCCESSIVE PATRIARCHS SPENT THEIR DAILY LIFE FACE TO FACE WITH\nSAKYAMUNI BUDDHA AND WATCHED BY HIS FACE.\nNow at the time of Dogen, Sakyamuni Gautam Buddha had been dead for fifteen hundred years. What does he mean by living face to face with Sakyamuni Buddha? He had only stone statues, utterly dead.\nIn my village there was, very close to my house, a temple of Shiva, and Shiva is represented with the Shivalinga. You must have seen Shiva temples: just any beautiful round stone is placed and that is Shivalinga, which means, \"The prick of the Lord Shiva.\" Now the devotees of Shiva are going to be freaked, but what can I do? I'm simply translating the word\n'Shivalinga'.\nOne of my friends' father lived just in front of that temple, and he was a great devotee of Shiva.\nI told him, \"You are wasting your time. That Shiva is absolutely worthless.\" He said, \"What do you mean? You are hurting my religious feelings.\"\nI said, \"That is going to be my profession my whole life. This is just the beginning. I have seen rats urinating on your Shiva. He cannot do anything to the rats, what is he going to do for you?\"\nHe was so angry that he told me, \"You get out of this house!\"\nI said, \"I will get out, whether you say it or not. But whenever you go to the temple I will be standing there by your side, watching your stupidity. I will not say a single word, but you will understand why I'm standing there.\"\nHe said, \"You are a strange boy.\"\nFrom that day, for almost six months, I followed him regularly. Whenever he would enter the temple he would look all around. I was able to see the temple from my house, so immediately I would enter and stand there without saying a word.\nAnd he would say, \"My God, have you come?\"\nI said, \"It is better to stop this stupidity. Don't you see so many rats in this temple?\"\nHe said, \"It is true. And it is also true that I have seen those rats urinating over the Shiva.\nBut this is just a statue, a representation, a symbol of the real Shiva.\" I said, \"Have you seen the real Shiva? Is he just a prick?\"\nHe said, \"Listen! You are not allowed to come into my house anymore!\"\nI said, \"I have no intention. If you stop coming to this temple, I will stop coming\nto your house. It is an agreement. But if you come to this temple, nobody can prevent me coming to your house and provoking you. I will do everything to make you aware that you are being very idiotic.\"\nHe said to his son, \"You drop your friendship with this boy, because this boy is going to spoil you. He's spoiling me, because sometimes I start thinking that perhaps I am being stupid.\nOn all rational grounds the boy is right. I have not seen Shiva, and I have never bothered about the meaning of Shivalinga.\"\nOsho - The Miracle 71\nChapter 5 - You must see for yourself\nHe said, \"You have started coming in my dreams.\"\nI said, \"If you prevent me coming to your house, then that is the only way I can wake you up.\"\nThe old man finally decided not to go to this temple. He went to another temple, but that was a temple of an elephant god. What difference does it make?\nDogen is talking about Sakyamuni Buddha as if the Buddha is alive and you are watching him.\nThere are certainly more statues of Gautam Buddha in the world than of anybody else. And his last statement before he died was, \"Don't make any statues of me, because I will not be in my stone statues.\" But just as nobody listens to the master ...\nThey resisted making statues for three hundred years, but then finally they gave up. First they started worshipping the grave of Gautam Buddha, but it is not much joy to worship a grave. Then somebody suggested worshipping the tree under which Gautam Buddha became enlightened. That was a better idea, a tree is at least a living phenomenon ... a beautiful tree with great foliage. But after all a tree is a tree, it cannot be a substitute for Gautam Buddha.\nNothing can be a substitute except your own consciousness.\nAll these statements made by Dogen simply show that he does not know.\nHOW MANY DAYS THEY HAD PASSED, I DON'T KNOW. WE SHOULD THINK\nCALMLY AND BE GLAD OF THIS. THEIR EYE AND FACE ARE THE BUDDHA'S\nBECAUSE THEY MADE BOWS TO THE BUDDHA'S FACE AND TRANSFERRED HIS\nEYE INTO THEIR OWN, AND VICE VERSA.\nIT IS THROUGH THE TRANSMISSION THAT THE EYE AND FACE HAD BEEN\nINCESSANTLY TRANSMITTED TILL NOW.\nTHERE IS NO GAP IN THE TRANSMISSION BETWEEN MASTER AND DISCIPLE, JUST AS ONE VINE COILS ROUND ANOTHER; THAT IS TO SAY, WE OPEN OUR\nEYES AND PRESENT THEM WITH THEMSELVES, THEY RECEIVE THEMSELVES.\nTHE SAME CAN ALSO BE SAID OF OUR FACE, MIND AND BODY.\nI said to you that it is a half truth. It is true that if you are living with a living master -- not with a statue -- then gazing into his eyes or just watching his presence, his gestures, you will see how awareness functions. And as you become more and more aware of your master, simultaneously you will be becoming aware of yourself.\nThe master finally proves to be a mirror. In the mirror you can see your face -- your original face, not the painted one which the society has given to you. You can see your original heart -- not the one which is used for pumping the blood in the body, but the original heart which is hiding behind it.\nWatching your master in his day-to-day life, something is transmitted. Some energy, some light, some fragrance reaches to you, but it cannot happen with a statue.\nThere are many Buddhist temples in China, in Japan, in India. Buddhists have disappeared from India, but all the beautiful places like Ajanta are nothing but Gautam Buddha's statues in different postures: sitting, lying, standing, sleeping, waking.\nOsho - The Miracle 72\nChapter 5 - You must see for yourself\nAnd in China Buddhists have done an almost impossible thing. There is a temple which is called, \"The Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas.\" A whole mountain has been carved into ten thousand buddhas. First the whole mountainside was carved into big caves. Then the statues were carved in those shaded caves. It must have taken thousands of years for thousands of sculptors, and of very fine potentialities, because the statues are so beautiful.\nBut it was a futile effort. In the time you can carve a buddha in marble, in that very time you can become a thousand times a buddha. So I consider it an absolute wastage of time.\nUNLESS A DISCIPLE SEES HIS MASTER, HE CANNOT BE SAID TO BE A DISCIPLE.\nObviously. Scholars are so foolish. If a disciple has not seen the master, it is obvious that he is not a disciple. A disciple exists only in reference to a master. A master can be alone, he is not dependent on disciples. His mastery depends only on his own awakening. But a disciple cannot be a disciple on his own accord; he has to be in deep trust, in love with someone who has arrived home.\nHe is saying it right, but he does not seem to know that at the time Buddha had already been dead for fifteen centuries -- and now it is twenty-five centuries. Dogen cannot be a disciple of Buddha. All the Buddhists are living in the fallacy that they are disciples of Buddha. You need a living master to transmit the radiation that wakes up your sleeping buddhahood. No statue can do that.\nTHEREFORE, THEY COULD DIRECTLY TOUCH THE BUDDHA'S FINE FACE.\nHe is still talking about statues. No disciple will dare to touch Buddha's face when he is living.\nThe East knows that the disciple's reach is up to the feet of the master. There is a certain science in it. As the disciple touches the master's feet, the master touches the disciple's head; it becomes a circle. From the feet the energy moves into the disciple and from the hand the energy moves into the disciple. And somewhere at the center of the disciple's heart, the master's energy creates enough fire to wake up the sleeping potentiality of the disciple.\nIt is not just a gesture of gratitude to touch the feet of the master. It has a subtle science about it. But you can TOUCH THE BUDDHA'S FINE FACE only if your Buddha is a stone statue. And by the way, I have to remind you that the face of the Buddha in the statues is not his. Because Buddha was born on the boundaries of Nepal and India, most probably he was Nepalese -- it was just on the boundary where the two countries meet -- he cannot have this face that appears in the statues.\nBy a strange coincidence, when his statues were first being made, Alexander the Great was visiting India. It was Alexander the Great's face that inspired the sculptors. Certainly the Greek face has a beauty of its own, and Alexander was one of the most beautiful men the earth has seen. So the face you see on Buddha is not even his.\nIn those days there were no photographs, so it was very easy to put anybody's head on anybody else's body. Even the body does not seem to be Buddha's. It seems to be almost seven feet tall; Nepalese are not that tall. Even in India seven feet is very, very rare. Nor was Buddha as athletic as the body seems to be; he had been in continuous self-torture for six years, the body would have become just bones.\nOsho - The Miracle 73\nChapter 5 - You must see for yourself\nThe statue is absolutely false. And by touching this statue's face, you cannot get any transmission. If you do it is imagination, it is hallucination. You are deluding yourself.\nAT THE TIME OF THE TRANSMISSION, OUR FACE WILL CHANGE\nCOMPLETELY. THE SKIN ITSELF WILL BE A GREAT MIRROR OF THE BUDDHAS, WHICH HAS NO FLAW INSIDE OR OUT. THE GREAT MIRROR GIVES THE\nTRANSMISSION TO THE GREAT MIRROR ITSELF.\nOnce in a while he says something beautiful. He was a great scholar at the time he was making these statements. It is true that when the transmission happens between a master and a disciple, the face of the disciple starts changing to a new grace, a new beauty, a new compassion, a new love, a new joy, a new dance. He starts reflecting his master's being on a smaller scale.\nBut it is possible only if the master is alive. I am against all statues because they are deceptive, they are deluding millions of people who may have been seeking and searching the truth. Every milestone shows them the way towards a temple or a synagogue or a mosque. The way is inwards, not outside.\nA great Sufi master is known to have gone through a great transmission. His name was Junnaid. He was the master of al-Hillaj Mansoor. Al-Hillaj Mansoor is more known to the world because he was crucified just like Jesus, but in a more cruel way. Part by part he was cut -- the American way, in installments.\nJunnaid was a very poor man. And it is said that unless at least once in your life you make the pilgrimage to Mecca, where the stone Kaaba is representing Mohammed's place ... It is from that stone that, sitting on his horse, he simply went upwards to paradise and took his horse too. If you are an authentic Mohammedan, you have to visit that place at least once in your lifetime. So even the poorest Mohammedans collect money, sell their houses, their farms, because it is an absolute necessity that before they die they must go to Kaaba.\nJunnaid was getting old and he was very poor, so he collected money from his neighbors.\nNobody refused because the money was for the journey to Kaaba; and\neverybody is told that if you support a Mohammedan on his pilgrimage, you also partake in the virtue of the great pilgrimage. So people gave him money, gave him some food, clothes, so that he could go. He had to travel ... but people were surprised: the next day he was back. It was expected that he would be back in about six months, three months going and three months coming. This was too quick! -- people could not believe it. And also, he looked absolutely transformed, so radiant, so blissful.\nThey said, \"What happened?\"\nJunnaid said, \"Kaaba itself came to meet me outside the village.\"\nThey said, \"This is sheer nonsense. That big stone?\" It is an asteroid that has fallen from the sky ... huge.\nThey asked him, \"At least tell us in detail what really has happened.\"\nA Sufi master, Bayazid, was sitting under a tree at the crossroads outside the village.\nJunnaid asked him, \"Which way should I go? I want to reach Kaaba at the pilgrimage time.\"\nAt a certain time every year Mohammedans from all over the world try to reach Kaaba.\nOsho - The Miracle 74\nChapter 5 - You must see for yourself\nBayazid said, \"Nonsense! Bring out all your money!\" And he said it with such authority that poor Junnaid brought all the money that he had gathered.\nAnd Bayazid said, \"There is no need to go anywhere! Just make the seven circles around me. I am the Kaaba!\"\nJunnaid could not believe it at first, but what to do? The man was so ... his eyes were so penetrating, his presence was so fragrant. He circled him seven times, as\nMohammedans are supposed to go round the Kaaba stone seven times.\nAnd Bayazid said, \"Now give me all the other provisions you have for the journey and go home! Your pilgrimage is complete.\"\nHe could feel that something had changed. He was no longer the old person who had come just a few minutes before. So he told the villagers, \"I met a man who said, 'I am the Kaaba!'\nand he took all my provisions and all my money and told me to make the seven rounds.\" A few people laughed. Those who were stupid laughed, but those who were wise understood because they could see the transformation that had happened.\nIt does not matter who the man was, but certainly the man was a man of realization. Just going around him seven times, Junnaid himself became a master.\nBut it cannot happen by going around a stone seven or seven hundred or seven thousand times.\nTHOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CORRECTLY GIVEN EYES TRUE ENOUGH TO SEE\nSAKYAMUNI BUDDHA PERSONALLY ...\nNow what nonsense he's talking! Buddha has been dead for fifteen hundred years, there is no way now to personally connect with him. Yes, you can connect with somebody else who is still alive and has the same taste of buddhahood. But he is not talking about that, he is talking about stone buddhas.\nEVERYONE, REGARDLESS OF SELF AND OTHERS, WHO SEES THE CORRECT\nTRANSMISSION OR THE REAL STUDY OF THIS NEW TRANSMISSION OF THE\nTATHAGATA SHOULD PRESERVE IT CAREFULLY.\nThe word 'study' shows that Dogen is still a student, a scholar, although he is\ntalking as if he knows. In the world you will come across people who are talking about God as if they know, and millions of people believe in them. It seems our minds have lived so long in slavery that we have forgotten even to question. Dogen is not told that what he is talking about is sheer nonsense.\nA fifteen-hundred-year gap cannot be filled. You have to find a living buddha. Of course, the living buddha will have the same taste and the same blissfulness and the same aura and the same energy as the original Gautam Buddha. But this is possible only with a living master.\nThe search for truth is basically the search for a living master. It is very rare that you can find the way without a master. But I allow the exception. I allow the exception because I myself never had any master.\nI have met with many so-called masters, but they all wanted to get rid of me, because my presence was such a danger to their respectability. I raised questions that they could not answer. Other disciples started disappearing, and they would say, \"Please, you go on and find somebody else; don't disturb our disciples. They never asked such questions before you came; now they have started asking strange questions about which we know nothing.\"\nOsho - The Miracle 75\nChapter 5 - You must see for yourself\nThere are around the world many who pretend that they know. But you can see in their eyes, in their gestures, in their silences, in their words, whether they know or they are just tape recorders, quoting scriptures.\nIt is not very difficult -- just scratch a little bit and you will find the scholar and the scripture. They cannot transmit truth, they cannot help you to open the door to existence; they can only create faith in you in some dead god, in some dead prophet. They are a great consolation, but a consolation is not a revolution.\nConsolation is very dangerous. It prevents you from searching more, it prevents you from searching deeper.\nA Zen poet wrote:\nI INTEND TO TRANSMIT IT TO YOU, BUT YOU CANNOT TAKE IT.\nYOU MAY YEARN TO IMITATE ME, NEITHER CAN THIS SUCCEED.\nIF YOU PURPOSELY TURN BACK, YOU ARE THE ONE WHO IS MEDDLING;\nIF I PART WITH YOU, YOU WOULD THINK ME DESTITUTE OF SENTIMENTS.\nThese are words of a master. He's saying, \"If you turn away on your own you are missing an opportunity. If I turn you away, I'm not compassionate.\" And it is intrinsic in being a buddha to be compassionate.\nBut you cannot imitate me and you cannot intend to have it transmitted to you; nor can you take it. It is not something which can be given. It is not something which has to be found somewhere. It is just a sleeping buddha waking up, just as every morning you superficially wake up. A day comes when you wake up in the very innermost core of your being, and once that waking has happened you never lose it.\nJakuan wrote:\nPERFECT MELODY -- LIKE WIND AMONG THE PINES OF FAR-OFF SLOPES. MIND IS WASHED SKY CLEAN:\nHEAR IT BEYOND ITSELF.\nThese are people of meditation, people of the path. They are not quoting scriptures, but their words become scriptures.\nOsho - The Miracle 76\nChapter 5 - You must see for yourself Another Zen poet:\nYOU MUST SEE FOR YOURSELF THE REED-FLOWERS DRENCHED IN MOONLIGHT.\nYou cannot believe in somebody else's eyes; YOU MUST SEE FOR YOURSELF THE\nREED FLOWERS DRENCHED IN MOONLIGHT.\nThe beauty is such that no description can be adequate. No explanation is possible.\nThe same is true on a far greater and far wider scale about your own being: you should see its beauty with your own eyes. Never have faith in anyone except yourself. Have trust in yourself, and if that trust finds a way and you fall in love with a certain energy, with a certain master ... Don't make any effort, just let it happen silently, without making any noise of footsteps.\nIf you are fortunate you may find someone. But don't feel destitute if you cannot find a master; the universal spirit is available to you directly. Just a little more courage ... Either a little more courage or a master -- both are possible at any time, in any age.\nQuestion 1 Maneesha has asked:\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\nARE YOU NOT THE EXCEPTION TO WHAT DOGEN SAYS -- IN THAT YOU DID\nNOT HAVE A PERSONAL TRANSMISSION FROM A MASTER?\nI have a transmission from the universe itself.

Devageet and Sarjano nod quietly. \"Well-a, how about twice a month-a?\" asks Azima.\n\"I wish!\" says Devageet, dreamily.\n\"Once a month?\" suggests Azima.

MASTER,</p><p>DOGEN WROTE:</p><p>SUCCESSIVE PATRIARCHS PERSONALLY TRANSMITTED THE DHARMA FROM MASTER
TO DISCIPLE. WITHOUT THE PERSONAL TRANSMISSION, NOT A SINGLE PATRIARCH,
MASTER OR DISCIPLE, COULD BE A BUDDHA OR A PATRIARCH.</p><p>IT IS JUST AS IF WE WERE MAKING INNUMERABLE SMALL RIVERS JOIN A GREAT
ONE, OR KEEPING THE LIGHT FROM GOING OUT, MAKING COUNTLESS</p><p>LIGHTS ONE AFTER ANOTHER: EVENTUALLY, THEY BECOME ONE. AND THERE</p><p>IS NO GAP IN THE FUNCTION OF THE TRANSMISSION BETWEEN MASTER AND</p><p>DISCIPLE.</p><p>SO SUCCESSIVE PATRIARCHS SPENT THEIR DAILY LIFE FACE-TO- FACE
WITH</p><p>SAKYAMUNI BUDDHA AND WATCHED BY HIS FACE. HOW MANY DAYS THEY</p><p>HAD PASSED, I DON'T KNOW. WE SHOULD THINK CALMLY AND BE GLAD OF</p><p>THIS. THEIR EYE AND FACE ARE THE BUDDHA'S BECAUSE THEY MADE BOWS</p><p>TO THE BUDDHA'S FACE AND TRANSFERRED HIS EYE INTO THEIR OWN, AND</p><p>VICE VERSA.</p><p>IT IS THROUGH THE TRANSMISSION THAT THE EYE AND FACE HAD BEEN</p><p>INCESSANTLY TRANSMITTED TILL NOW.</p><p>THERE IS NO GAP IN THE TRANSMISSION BETWEEN MASTER AND DISCIPLE, JUST
AS ONE VINE COILS ROUND ANOTHER; THAT IS TO SAY, WE OPEN OUR</p><p>EYES AND PRESENT THEM WITH THEMSELVES, THEY RECEIVE THEMSELVES.</p><p>THE SAME CAN ALSO BE SAID OF OUR FACE, MIND AND BODY.</p><p>UNLESS A DISCIPLE SEES HIS MASTER, HE CANNOT BE SAID TO BE A
DISCIPLE; UNLESS A MASTER SEES HIS DISCIPLE, HE CANNOT BE A MASTER.</p><p>BOTH OF THEM HAVE GOT THE TRANSMISSION AND SUCCEEDED TO THE</p><p>DHARMA BY SEEING EACH OTHER. THAT IS AN APPEARANCE OF THE</p><p>TRANSMISSION OF THE PATRIARCHS. THEREFORE, THEY COULD DIRECTLY</p><p>TOUCH THE BUDDHA'S FINE FACE.</p><p>AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSMISSION, OUR FACE WILL CHANGE</p><p>COMPLETELY. THE SKIN ITSELF WILL BE A GREAT MIRROR OF THE BUDDHAS,
WHICH HAS NO FLAW INSIDE OR OUT. THE GREAT MIRROR GIVES THE</p><p>TRANSMISSION TO THE GREAT MIRROR ITSELF. THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN</p><p>CORRECTLY GIVEN EYES TRUE ENOUGH TO SEE SAKYAMUNI BUDDHA PERSONALLY,
ARE MORE INTIMATE WITH HIM THAN HE IS WITH HIMSELF.</p><p>EVERYONE, REGARDLESS OF SELF AND OTHERS, WHO SEES THE CORRECT</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 66</p><p>Chapter 5 - You must see for yourself</p><p>TRANSMISSION OR THE REAL STUDY OF THIS NEW TRANSMISSION OF THE</p><p>TATHAGATA SHOULD PRESERVE IT CAREFULLY.</p><p>Maneesha, before I enter into the serious statements of a scholarly
Dogen, I would like Avirbhava first to inaugurate.</p><p>It is not a bear, as I said yesterday -- because around the world I
have so many cases against me, accusing me of hurting people's religious
feelings. And the bear is worshipped by men.</p><p>It is really a pig. I had to ask Anando to research whether
somebody's heart feelings would be hurt if we inaugurate the Museum of
the Ancient Dead Gods with a pig. Avirbhava is going to be the Director
General. She is completely ready -- with the ears of a pig, and a tail
too.</p><p>(AVIRBHAVA IS DRESSED IN PIG EARS AND A CURLY TAIL.) About pigs:</p><p>"In the ancient world pigs were considered the embodiment of the
'Corn Spirit', Osiris. He was the great Egyptian god of the underworld
and judge of the dead.</p><p>In Greece pigs were sacred to Demeter, the goddess of the fruitful
soil and agriculture.</p><p>And today they are considered sacred in New Guinea.</p><p>In China the pig is considered a great delicacy and, as in many other
countries in the past too, was traditionally served at banquets and
feasts, notably marriage ceremonies. While people ate the roasted pork,
they could view the stuffed pig in the center of the banquet table.</p><p>Great care was always taken to choose a pig's head that had a
pleasing face.</p><p>Pigs were particularly popular at marriages because they represented
virtue and fertility.</p><p>Generally, in China, pigs are venerated because they represent good
fortune."</p><p>So it is absolutely appropriate for Avirbhava to inaugurate the
museum with her own hands.</p><p>Avirbhava, bring your pig ... and inaugurate!</p><p>(AVIRBHAVA PLACES A CUDDLY SOFT PINK PIG ON THE PODIUM AND IT</p><p>PROCEEDS TO WADDLE ACROSS THE MARBLE IN FRONT OF THE MASTER'S</p><p>FEET, MAKING GRUNTING NOISES AS ITS SNOUT AND TAIL</p><p>WRIGGLE.) That is good.</p><p>Now we can turn to the serious matter.</p><p>Even this inauguration will hurt many people's religious beliefs, so
there will be a few more cases. But this has been the right ancient god
with which to inaugurate this museum, where we are going to collect all
the dead gods that have been worshipped by a stupid humanity.</p><p>Buddhas have been forced to worship pigs and nobody has objected.
Stones, monkeys, elephants -- you name it, they have all been worshipped
somewhere or other. But nowhere in the whole history of mankind has man
been given the dignity of a god. I am for the first time giving you the
dignity of a god, and I want you to make a plaything of all the
so-called gods Osho - The Miracle</p><p>67</p><p>Chapter 5 - You must see for yourself</p><p>worshipped by humanity. It is such a degradation, such a humiliation.
But man has accepted slavery without revolting against it.</p><p>If the crowd was worshipping the pig they followed the crowd, because
the crowd gave them security and coziness and they had not the courage
to revolt. Our museum will be specially devoted to all those idiots who
have worshipped animals rather than searching for their own super-human
consciousness, their own buddha; looking into mosques and synagogues and
temples rather than looking into themselves.</p><p>It will create legal problems, but that does not matter. I have faced
legal problems my whole life. I tremendously enjoy the stupidity of the
judiciary around the world. They are still protecting those people whose
feelings are hurt if you say anything about the pigs. In the name of
religion all kinds of nonsense has been forced on man's mind.</p><p>My basic function is to take away all this nonsense from you so you
can come out in your full glory -- a full moon, a buddha, sufficient
unto yourself. I don't teach any prayer, I simply teach exploration of
the inner world. There is the treasure; not in the scriptures, as Dogen
is saying.</p><p>DOGEN WROTE:</p><p>SUCCESSIVE PATRIARCHS PERSONALLY TRANSMITTED THE DHARMA FROM MASTER
TO DISCIPLE.</p><p>It is a half truth, and a half truth is more dangerous than a lie. A
lie is at least complete.</p><p>Half truths are very dangerous because they hide the lie behind them,
so on the</p><p>surface it looks as if what is projected is true.</p><p>What he is saying -- that SUCCESSIVE PATRIARCHS PERSONALLY
TRANSMITTED THE DHARMA FROM MASTER TO DISCIPLE -- has a</p><p>little truth in it.</p><p>That has been so with most of the masters, that they have received
the essence, the experience, in the presence of a master. It has been a
transmission between two energies. But it is not an absolute principle
that he is making:</p><p>WITHOUT THE PERSONAL TRANSMISSION NOT A SINGLE PATRIARCH, MASTER OR
DISCIPLE COULD BE A BUDDHA OR A PATRIARCH.</p><p>This is so obviously stupid -- because who was the master of Gautam
Buddha himself?</p><p>From where did he get the transmission?</p><p>According to Dogen he needed to have a master -- but he had none. It
is only a half truth.</p><p>But the other half is more important, for the simple reason that you
may not find a master, but the universal spirit is always available
everywhere.</p><p>The really courageous people simply take the jump into the universal
being without being pushed by a master. It simply depends on your
courage.</p><p>To be a buddha is your birthright. Just a little courage and you can
declare yourself a buddha. But the mind hesitates, the mind thinks a
thousand and one things -- what will happen to my smoking? What about
the girlfriend? And what about the bank balance?</p><p>These small things I allow you to have. You can be a buddha and smoke
-- that will just simply show that you are a stupid buddha! But stupid
or not stupid, nobody can take away your buddhahood. You can have a
girlfriend -- even Sardar Gurudayal Singh is having girlfriends and he
is a well-known buddha, ancient. I don't think he himself knows how old
he Osho - The Miracle</p><p>68</p><p>Chapter 5 - You must see for yourself</p><p>is! But there is no time for him to get old. Girlfriends continuously
keep him so engaged, he has no time to grow old. One needs time to grow
old.</p><p>I allow you every concession that you want except unawareness; that I
cannot allow because that is fundamental to buddhahood. If you are alert
and aware and conscious there is no need of any master. Universal energy
itself transmits the light, the arrow that penetrates to your very
center, and you become connected with the whole.</p><p>A master is a small window from which you can see the starry sky. But
that does not mean that first you need a window, only then you can see
the starry night. Why don't you come out of the door?</p><p>Mulla Nasruddin died ... his grave still exists in Iran. He used to
carry his door wherever he would go, and people would ask, "What is the
matter? Why are you carrying that board?</p><p>Have you become a Christian?" But even Christ was carrying only the
cross, not a board. "Is it some improvement on the cross?"</p><p>He said "No, it is just a security measure. Nobody can enter into my
house except through the door. So I carry the door."</p><p>When he died his disciples wondered what to do about the door. He had
left a written will in which he mentioned it: "Just put the door in
front of my grave, lock it and put the keys in my hand inside the
grave."</p><p>They are still there, the door and the grave; and the skeleton must
have the keys. He is saying, "If the door is closed and the keys are
with me, nobody can disturb my sleep until the judgment day, nobody can
enter into the grave." He has taken security measures. Even after death,
the door is locked. You may think it seems to be utter foolishness, but
the man was laughing about you in all his acts, all his statements.</p><p>This act is also simply laughing at your stupidity. What do you think
about your security, your bank balance? You can go bankrupt. What do you
think of your</p><p>security, your husband, your wife? If either of you is intelligent
enough, he will escape.</p><p>There is no security. Even if you carry the door there is no
security; in fact it makes you more vulnerable. Thieves don't bother
about entering through the door. In fact they never enter through the
door; they just make a hole in the wall on their own accord.</p><p>But the most hilarious part is ... one cold winter night a thief
entered into Mulla Nasruddin's house. Mulla Nasruddin opened one eye and
looked at the thief. The thief started trembling -- a man asleep with
one eye open? Now he can neither go in, nor even get out. He was so much
afraid, but Mulla said, "Don't be worried, I'm coming with you."</p><p>He said, "Where?"</p><p>Mulla said, "Into the house where you are going." The thief said,
"You seem to be mad! I am a thief!"</p><p>Mulla said, "I don't care who you are. For thirty years I have been
looking around in this house, and I haven't found anything. Now let us
have a partnership</p><p>-- whatever is found we split fifty-fifty. You came at the right
time, because I was becoming discouraged."</p><p>The thief said, "My God!" Osho - The Miracle</p><p>69</p><p>Chapter 5 - You must see for yourself</p><p>But he had to go in, and there was nothing. Mulla followed him with
his lamp to show him the way everywhere. The thief wanted to escape
somehow, because with the lamp Mulla would see his face. Tomorrow the
whole city would know that he is a thief.</p><p>Mulla said, "Don't be worried, that's why I had opened only one eye.
I'm not looking at you. My concern is our partnership."</p><p>He said, "What partnership? There is nothing to be found."</p><p>He said, "That's what I was trying to tell you, but you wouldn't
listen." The thief said, "I want to go!"</p><p>Nasruddin said, "Where?" "I'm going to my house."</p><p>Nasruddin said, "I'm also coming. Partners should live together!" The
thief said, "My God, this is a difficulty. I have a wife."</p><p>Nasruddin said, "Don't be worried about that, I will take care of
her. You just do your job and I will take care of your wife."</p><p>This man whose house was empty was carrying the door all around,
wherever he was going, making a statement in his own way. The man was of
immense intelligence. He is saying that it is only a door and nothing
else. Just look through the door and the whole sky is open. By carrying
the door he was saying that he is a master, a door to the divinity. But
he was a unique person.</p><p>Dogen is still a scholar. I wonder how he could not see the simple
point when he said: WITHOUT THE PERSONAL TRANSMISSION, NOT A SINGLE
PATRIARCH, MASTER OR DISCIPLE, COULD BE A BUDDHA OR A PATRIARCH.</p><p>What about the first buddha? And if it can happen to Gautam Buddha
without any master, why can it not happen to anybody else?</p><p>To become enlightened is everybody's birthright, it is not a monopoly
of Buddha's. These statements show that Dogen is still learning
scriptures. He's not a buddha yet.</p><p>He became a buddha finally, after he had gone unnecessarily astray
carrying the load of Buddhist scriptures. Finally, when he got finished
and fed up with the scriptures and dropped them, he was surprised to
realize that from the very beginning there was no need to search.</p><p>You are it. The seeker is the goal. If you go on seeking other goals,
you are going away from yourself. Seeking has to stop.</p><p>IT IS JUST, says Dogen, AS IF WE WERE MAKING INNUMERABLE SMALL</p><p>RIVERS JOIN A GREAT ONE, OR KEEPING THE LIGHT FROM GOING OUT, MAKING
COUNTLESS LIGHTS ONE AFTER ANOTHER: EVENTUALLY, THEY</p><p>BECOME ONE.</p><p>Partly he is right, but only partly. But buddhas don't make partial
statements. Their statements are categorically absolute.</p><p>AND THERE IS NO GAP IN THE FUNCTION OF THE TRANSMISSION BETWEEN</p><p>MASTER AND DISCIPLE.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 70</p><p>Chapter 5 - You must see for yourself</p><p>SO SUCCESSIVE PATRIARCHS SPENT THEIR DAILY LIFE FACE TO FACE WITH</p><p>SAKYAMUNI BUDDHA AND WATCHED BY HIS FACE.</p><p>Now at the time of Dogen, Sakyamuni Gautam Buddha had been dead for
fifteen hundred years. What does he mean by living face to face with
Sakyamuni Buddha? He had only stone statues, utterly dead.</p><p>In my village there was, very close to my house, a temple of Shiva,
and Shiva is represented with the Shivalinga. You must have seen Shiva
temples: just any beautiful round stone is placed and that is
Shivalinga, which means, "The prick of the Lord Shiva." Now the devotees
of Shiva are going to be freaked, but what can I do? I'm simply
translating the word</p><p>'Shivalinga'.</p><p>One of my friends' father lived just in front of that temple, and he
was a great devotee of Shiva.</p><p>I told him, "You are wasting your time. That Shiva is absolutely
worthless." He said, "What do you mean? You are hurting my religious
feelings."</p><p>I said, "That is going to be my profession my whole life. This is
just the beginning. I have seen rats urinating on your Shiva. He cannot
do anything to the rats, what is he going to do for you?"</p><p>He was so angry that he told me, "You get out of this house!"</p><p>I said, "I will get out, whether you say it or not. But whenever you
go to the temple I will be standing there by your side, watching your
stupidity. I will not say a single word, but you will understand why I'm
standing there."</p><p>He said, "You are a strange boy."</p><p>From that day, for almost six months, I followed him regularly.
Whenever he would enter the temple he would look all around. I was able
to see the temple from my house, so immediately I would enter and stand
there without saying a word.</p><p>And he would say, "My God, have you come?"</p><p>I said, "It is better to stop this stupidity. Don't you see so many
rats in this temple?"</p><p>He said, "It is true. And it is also true that I have seen those rats
urinating over the Shiva.</p><p>But this is just a statue, a representation, a symbol of the real
Shiva." I said, "Have you seen the real Shiva? Is he just a prick?"</p><p>He said, "Listen! You are not allowed to come into my house
anymore!"</p><p>I said, "I have no intention. If you stop coming to this temple, I
will stop coming</p><p>to your house. It is an agreement. But if you come to this temple,
nobody can prevent me coming to your house and provoking you. I will do
everything to make you aware that you are being very idiotic."</p><p>He said to his son, "You drop your friendship with this boy, because
this boy is going to spoil you. He's spoiling me, because sometimes I
start thinking that perhaps I am being stupid.</p><p>On all rational grounds the boy is right. I have not seen Shiva, and
I have never bothered about the meaning of Shivalinga."</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 71</p><p>Chapter 5 - You must see for yourself</p><p>He said, "You have started coming in my dreams."</p><p>I said, "If you prevent me coming to your house, then that is the
only way I can wake you up."</p><p>The old man finally decided not to go to this temple. He went to
another temple, but that was a temple of an elephant god. What
difference does it make?</p><p>Dogen is talking about Sakyamuni Buddha as if the Buddha is alive and
you are watching him.</p><p>There are certainly more statues of Gautam Buddha in the world than
of anybody else. And his last statement before he died was, "Don't make
any statues of me, because I will not be in my stone statues." But just
as nobody listens to the master ...</p><p>They resisted making statues for three hundred years, but then
finally they gave up. First they started worshipping the grave of Gautam
Buddha, but it is not much joy to worship a grave. Then somebody
suggested worshipping the tree under which Gautam Buddha became
enlightened. That was a better idea, a tree is at least a living
phenomenon ... a beautiful tree with great foliage. But after all a tree
is a tree, it cannot be a substitute for Gautam Buddha.</p><p>Nothing can be a substitute except your own consciousness.</p><p>All these statements made by Dogen simply show that he does not
know.</p><p>HOW MANY DAYS THEY HAD PASSED, I DON'T KNOW. WE SHOULD THINK</p><p>CALMLY AND BE GLAD OF THIS. THEIR EYE AND FACE ARE THE BUDDHA'S</p><p>BECAUSE THEY MADE BOWS TO THE BUDDHA'S FACE AND TRANSFERRED HIS</p><p>EYE INTO THEIR OWN, AND VICE VERSA.</p><p>IT IS THROUGH THE TRANSMISSION THAT THE EYE AND FACE HAD BEEN</p><p>INCESSANTLY TRANSMITTED TILL NOW.</p><p>THERE IS NO GAP IN THE TRANSMISSION BETWEEN MASTER AND DISCIPLE, JUST
AS ONE VINE COILS ROUND ANOTHER; THAT IS TO SAY, WE OPEN OUR</p><p>EYES AND PRESENT THEM WITH THEMSELVES, THEY RECEIVE THEMSELVES.</p><p>THE SAME CAN ALSO BE SAID OF OUR FACE, MIND AND BODY.</p><p>I said to you that it is a half truth. It is true that if you are
living with a living master -- not with a statue -- then gazing into his
eyes or just watching his presence, his gestures, you will see how
awareness functions. And as you become more and more aware of your
master, simultaneously you will be becoming aware of yourself.</p><p>The master finally proves to be a mirror. In the mirror you can see
your face -- your original face, not the painted one which the society
has given to you. You can see your original heart -- not the one which
is used for pumping the blood in the body, but the original heart which
is hiding behind it.</p><p>Watching your master in his day-to-day life, something is
transmitted. Some energy, some light, some fragrance reaches to you, but
it cannot happen with a statue.</p><p>There are many Buddhist temples in China, in Japan, in India.
Buddhists have disappeared from India, but all the beautiful places like
Ajanta are nothing but Gautam Buddha's statues in different postures:
sitting, lying, standing, sleeping, waking.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 72</p><p>Chapter 5 - You must see for yourself</p><p>And in China Buddhists have done an almost impossible thing. There is
a temple which is called, "The Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas." A whole
mountain has been carved into ten thousand buddhas. First the whole
mountainside was carved into big caves. Then the statues were carved in
those shaded caves. It must have taken thousands of years for thousands
of sculptors, and of very fine potentialities, because the statues are
so beautiful.</p><p>But it was a futile effort. In the time you can carve a buddha in
marble, in that very time you can become a thousand times a buddha. So I
consider it an absolute wastage of time.</p><p>UNLESS A DISCIPLE SEES HIS MASTER, HE CANNOT BE SAID TO BE A
DISCIPLE.</p><p>Obviously. Scholars are so foolish. If a disciple has not seen the
master, it is obvious that he is not a disciple. A disciple exists only
in reference to a master. A master can be alone, he is not dependent on
disciples. His mastery depends only on his own awakening. But a disciple
cannot be a disciple on his own accord; he has to be in deep trust, in
love with someone who has arrived home.</p><p>He is saying it right, but he does not seem to know that at the time
Buddha had already been dead for fifteen centuries -- and now it is
twenty-five centuries. Dogen cannot be a disciple of Buddha. All the
Buddhists are living in the fallacy that they are disciples of Buddha.
You need a living master to transmit the radiation that wakes up your
sleeping buddhahood. No statue can do that.</p><p>THEREFORE, THEY COULD DIRECTLY TOUCH THE BUDDHA'S FINE FACE.</p><p>He is still talking about statues. No disciple will dare to touch
Buddha's face when he is living.</p><p>The East knows that the disciple's reach is up to the feet of the
master. There is a certain science in it. As the disciple touches the
master's feet, the master touches the disciple's head; it becomes a
circle. From the feet the energy moves into the disciple and from the
hand the energy moves into the disciple. And somewhere at the center of
the disciple's heart, the master's energy creates enough fire to wake up
the sleeping potentiality of the disciple.</p><p>It is not just a gesture of gratitude to touch the feet of the
master. It has a subtle science about it. But you can TOUCH THE BUDDHA'S
FINE FACE only if your Buddha is a stone statue. And by the way, I have
to remind you that the face of the Buddha in the statues is not his.
Because Buddha was born on the boundaries of Nepal and India, most
probably he was Nepalese -- it was just on the boundary where the two
countries meet -- he cannot have this face that appears in the
statues.</p><p>By a strange coincidence, when his statues were first being made,
Alexander the Great was visiting India. It was Alexander the Great's
face that inspired the sculptors. Certainly the Greek face has a beauty
of its own, and Alexander was one of the most beautiful men the earth
has seen. So the face you see on Buddha is not even his.</p><p>In those days there were no photographs, so it was very easy to put
anybody's head on anybody else's body. Even the body does not seem to be
Buddha's. It seems to be almost seven feet tall; Nepalese are not that
tall. Even in India seven feet is very, very rare. Nor was Buddha as
athletic as the body seems to be; he had been in continuous self-torture
for six years, the body would have become just bones.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 73</p><p>Chapter 5 - You must see for yourself</p><p>The statue is absolutely false. And by touching this statue's face,
you cannot get any transmission. If you do it is imagination, it is
hallucination. You are deluding yourself.</p><p>AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSMISSION, OUR FACE WILL CHANGE</p><p>COMPLETELY. THE SKIN ITSELF WILL BE A GREAT MIRROR OF THE BUDDHAS,
WHICH HAS NO FLAW INSIDE OR OUT. THE GREAT MIRROR GIVES THE</p><p>TRANSMISSION TO THE GREAT MIRROR ITSELF.</p><p>Once in a while he says something beautiful. He was a great scholar
at the time he was making these statements. It is true that when the
transmission happens between a master and a disciple, the face of the
disciple starts changing to a new grace, a new beauty, a new compassion,
a new love, a new joy, a new dance. He starts reflecting his master's
being on a smaller scale.</p><p>But it is possible only if the master is alive. I am against all
statues because they are deceptive, they are deluding millions of people
who may have been seeking and searching the truth. Every milestone shows
them the way towards a temple or a synagogue or a mosque. The way is
inwards, not outside.</p><p>A great Sufi master is known to have gone through a great
transmission. His name was Junnaid. He was the master of al-Hillaj
Mansoor. Al-Hillaj Mansoor is more known to the world because he was
crucified just like Jesus, but in a more cruel way. Part by part he was
cut -- the American way, in installments.</p><p>Junnaid was a very poor man. And it is said that unless at least once
in your life you make the pilgrimage to Mecca, where the stone Kaaba is
representing Mohammed's place ... It is from that stone that, sitting on
his horse, he simply went upwards to paradise and took his horse too. If
you are an authentic Mohammedan, you have to visit that place at least
once in your lifetime. So even the poorest Mohammedans collect money,
sell their houses, their farms, because it is an absolute necessity that
before they die they must go to Kaaba.</p><p>Junnaid was getting old and he was very poor, so he collected money
from his neighbors.</p><p>Nobody refused because the money was for the journey to Kaaba;
and</p><p>everybody is told that if you support a Mohammedan on his pilgrimage,
you also partake in the virtue of the great pilgrimage. So people gave
him money, gave him some food, clothes, so that he could go. He had to
travel ... but people were surprised: the next day he was back. It was
expected that he would be back in about six months, three months going
and three months coming. This was too quick! -- people could not believe
it. And also, he looked absolutely transformed, so radiant, so
blissful.</p><p>They said, "What happened?"</p><p>Junnaid said, "Kaaba itself came to meet me outside the village."</p><p>They said, "This is sheer nonsense. That big stone?" It is an
asteroid that has fallen from the sky ... huge.</p><p>They asked him, "At least tell us in detail what really has
happened."</p><p>A Sufi master, Bayazid, was sitting under a tree at the crossroads
outside the village.</p><p>Junnaid asked him, "Which way should I go? I want to reach Kaaba at
the pilgrimage time."</p><p>At a certain time every year Mohammedans from all over the world try
to reach Kaaba.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 74</p><p>Chapter 5 - You must see for yourself</p><p>Bayazid said, "Nonsense! Bring out all your money!" And he said it
with such authority that poor Junnaid brought all the money that he had
gathered.</p><p>And Bayazid said, "There is no need to go anywhere! Just make the
seven circles around me. I am the Kaaba!"</p><p>Junnaid could not believe it at first, but what to do? The man was so
... his eyes were so penetrating, his presence was so fragrant. He
circled him seven times, as</p><p>Mohammedans are supposed to go round the Kaaba stone seven times.</p><p>And Bayazid said, "Now give me all the other provisions you have for
the journey and go home! Your pilgrimage is complete."</p><p>He could feel that something had changed. He was no longer the old
person who had come just a few minutes before. So he told the villagers,
"I met a man who said, 'I am the Kaaba!'</p><p>and he took all my provisions and all my money and told me to make
the seven rounds." A few people laughed. Those who were stupid laughed,
but those who were wise understood because they could see the
transformation that had happened.</p><p>It does not matter who the man was, but certainly the man was a man
of realization. Just going around him seven times, Junnaid himself
became a master.</p><p>But it cannot happen by going around a stone seven or seven hundred
or seven thousand times.</p><p>THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CORRECTLY GIVEN EYES TRUE ENOUGH TO SEE</p><p>SAKYAMUNI BUDDHA PERSONALLY ...</p><p>Now what nonsense he's talking! Buddha has been dead for fifteen
hundred years, there is no way now to personally connect with him. Yes,
you can connect with somebody else who is still alive and has the same
taste of buddhahood. But he is not talking about that, he is talking
about stone buddhas.</p><p>EVERYONE, REGARDLESS OF SELF AND OTHERS, WHO SEES THE CORRECT</p><p>TRANSMISSION OR THE REAL STUDY OF THIS NEW TRANSMISSION OF THE</p><p>TATHAGATA SHOULD PRESERVE IT CAREFULLY.</p><p>The word 'study' shows that Dogen is still a student, a scholar,
although he is</p><p>talking as if he knows. In the world you will come across people who
are talking about God as if they know, and millions of people believe in
them. It seems our minds have lived so long in slavery that we have
forgotten even to question. Dogen is not told that what he is talking
about is sheer nonsense.</p><p>A fifteen-hundred-year gap cannot be filled. You have to find a
living buddha. Of course, the living buddha will have the same taste and
the same blissfulness and the same aura and the same energy as the
original Gautam Buddha. But this is possible only with a living
master.</p><p>The search for truth is basically the search for a living master. It
is very rare that you can find the way without a master. But I allow the
exception. I allow the exception because I myself never had any
master.</p><p>I have met with many so-called masters, but they all wanted to get
rid of me, because my presence was such a danger to their
respectability. I raised questions that they could not answer. Other
disciples started disappearing, and they would say, "Please, you go on
and find somebody else; don't disturb our disciples. They never asked
such questions before you came; now they have started asking strange
questions about which we know nothing."</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 75</p><p>Chapter 5 - You must see for yourself</p><p>There are around the world many who pretend that they know. But you
can see in their eyes, in their gestures, in their silences, in their
words, whether they know or they are just tape recorders, quoting
scriptures.</p><p>It is not very difficult -- just scratch a little bit and you will
find the scholar and the scripture. They cannot transmit truth, they
cannot help you to open the door to existence; they can only create
faith in you in some dead god, in some dead prophet. They are a great
consolation, but a consolation is not a revolution.</p><p>Consolation is very dangerous. It prevents you from searching more,
it prevents you from searching deeper.</p><p>A Zen poet wrote:</p><p>I INTEND TO TRANSMIT IT TO YOU, BUT YOU CANNOT TAKE IT.</p><p>YOU MAY YEARN TO IMITATE ME, NEITHER CAN THIS SUCCEED.</p><p>IF YOU PURPOSELY TURN BACK, YOU ARE THE ONE WHO IS MEDDLING;</p><p>IF I PART WITH YOU, YOU WOULD THINK ME DESTITUTE OF SENTIMENTS.</p><p>These are words of a master. He's saying, "If you turn away on your
own you are missing an opportunity. If I turn you away, I'm not
compassionate." And it is intrinsic in being a buddha to be
compassionate.</p><p>But you cannot imitate me and you cannot intend to have it
transmitted to you; nor can you take it. It is not something which can
be given. It is not something which has to be found somewhere. It is
just a sleeping buddha waking up, just as every morning you
superficially wake up. A day comes when you wake up in the very
innermost core of your being, and once that waking has happened you
never lose it.</p><p>Jakuan wrote:</p><p>PERFECT MELODY -- LIKE WIND AMONG THE PINES OF FAR-OFF SLOPES. MIND
IS WASHED SKY CLEAN:</p><p>HEAR IT BEYOND ITSELF.</p><p>These are people of meditation, people of the path. They are not
quoting scriptures, but their words become scriptures.</p><p>Osho - The Miracle 76</p><p>Chapter 5 - You must see for yourself Another Zen poet:</p><p>YOU MUST SEE FOR YOURSELF THE REED-FLOWERS DRENCHED IN MOONLIGHT.</p><p>You cannot believe in somebody else's eyes; YOU MUST SEE FOR YOURSELF
THE</p><p>REED FLOWERS DRENCHED IN MOONLIGHT.</p><p>The beauty is such that no description can be adequate. No
explanation is possible.</p><p>The same is true on a far greater and far wider scale about your own
being: you should see its beauty with your own eyes. Never have faith in
anyone except yourself. Have trust in yourself, and if that trust finds
a way and you fall in love with a certain energy, with a certain master
... Don't make any effort, just let it happen silently, without making
any noise of footsteps.</p><p>If you are fortunate you may find someone. But don't feel destitute
if you cannot find a master; the universal spirit is available to you
directly. Just a little more courage ... Either a little more courage or
a master -- both are possible at any time, in any age.</p><p>Question 1 Maneesha has asked:</p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>ARE YOU NOT THE EXCEPTION TO WHAT DOGEN SAYS -- IN THAT YOU DID</p><p>NOT HAVE A PERSONAL TRANSMISSION FROM A MASTER?</p><p>I have a transmission from the universe itself.

Get deeper and deeper into the heart. Forget your head completely. Become headless, as if the head is no more there. Function from the heart. Never do anything unless it is your feeling to do it; never do anything only because you think it is right. Through thinking you will never come to the ultimate; you have to come through the door of feeling.\nThere are two types of people in the world: one type can come through thinking, the other type can come only through feeling. Both arrive at the same space: that space is god. It is the same temple but there are two doors to it.\n[The new sannyasin would like to know if he has known Gurdjieff.]\nNo, not at all. And even if you had known him, there would have been no connection. He had nothing to do with the feeling type. His work is not that of love; it is hard, calculated work, it is mathematical and scientific. It is not alchemy: it is pure chemistry. Gurdjieff is not the man for you and you are not the man for him!\nKnowing a man like Gurdjieff simply means only one thing: unless you are in contact. . . You may have passed him, you may have seen him, but that doesn’t matter. You may have travelled in the same compartment of a train; that doesn’t matter. There could not have been any possible connection between you and Gurdjieff.\nUdgatri means the singer of divine songs. Life has meaning only when you are capable of exploding into songs.\nWe live like closed buds, and we have to open up like flowers; in that very opening life becomes meaningful. Unless one can share one’s being with existence one remains meaningless.\nEveryone has come here to sing a song, and no-one else can sing the song that you can sing; it has to be just yours and only yours. If you don’t sing it there is no substitute for it. The world will remain lacking in that tor ever and tor ever, something will be missing. You will never feel worthy and you will never feel part of existence; you will remain an outsider, a stranger.\nThe moment we pour our being into existence in celebration, we become part of it. In that very pouring the ego disappears. In fact, the ego cannot disappear unless yoU have sung your song and danced your dance.\nUdgatri is an ancient word. It was used for the priests in India who used to madly sing the songs of god. Technically they were not singers, not musicians, but they were a song, they were music. They were madly in love with existence. Out of that mad love something was born in them and through them.\nUdbhava means real birth. Sannyas is the science of real birth. The first birth is physical; it only makes your body but not you. Your body arises in the mother’s womb but you have still to be born. The temple is empty, the master is not there yet, or in other words the master is asleep. And only when the master awakens is one really born; that is the second birth. That is the meaning of all methods of initiation. Initiation means that you are entering into a school which will function like a womb to create your soul.\nSannyas is a great commitment – a commitment to yourself to be reborn.\nUnmana means no-mind. Mind is the only barrier between you and you. The first you is your false ego and the second you is your real I. The first is a personality, the second is your soul; and between the two is the mind. The mind supports the personality in every way. Personality is an outgrowth of the mind: personality is the mind’s without and the mind is the personality’s within; they both help each other.\nUnless one drops the mind one remains pseudo. Dropping the mind is dropping the personality; dropping the mind is dropping the masks; dropping the mind is becoming utterly nude. In that nudity one encounters oneself as one really is – not as one thinks, not as one wants, not as others expect, but as one really is. To know it is to know the truth, and to know the truth is to ke liberated.\nTruth liberates, naked truth liberates. [Upgeya means to be celebrated.]\nLife is a gift to be celebrated, a gift which we go on taking for granted, for which we don’t feel any thankfulness. And that is the only sin: not to feel grateful to the whole for giving such a precious, immensely valuable gift. We cannot pay for it, and because we cannot pay for it – there is no way to pay – we can only be in a tremendous thankfulness. Because we cannot pay for it, religion is born.\nReligion is nothing but gratefulness, and this gratefulness can be expressed only through celebration. It should not be just verbal, it should be in your dance, it should be in your very being. It can’t be just a thank you to god; that will be too poor. Words cannot convey anything, you have to become the thank you.\nThat is the meaning of upgeya: when one feels so grateful that one dances in gratefulness; and that’s my whole teaching here.\nDeva means divine, parinita means married to – married to the divine. Unless that happens, nothing happens. Unless one starts moving in deep love with the whole, all other loves fail. They fail only because the desire is for the whole. If you understand it they can’t fail; they become stepping-stones. Then each lover is a ray of god, each love is a small dew-drop of the same immense ocean. Then nothing fails, everything succeeds, and everything becomes part of the great context. Everything becomes a step and it takes you higher and higher. But the vision should be clear, that one is married to god. All other marriages are on the way; all other love affairs are part of the great love affair with god.\nLet sannyas be the beginning of this great love affair. Sannyas is true only if it becomes a marriage to the divine.\nDeva means god, upnita means brought close to.\nSannyas is a bridge to bring you close to god. It is not a religion: it is a way, a way of life. It has no creed; it is a simple understanding, with no philosophy, with no theology, with no dogma. It is a way of living life naturally, spontaneously, consciously; but that becomes the bridge.\nThen slowly, slowly you go on coming closer and closer to god. You don’t know where god is so you cannot move directly towards god. But if you become aware, alert, authentic, and you live spontaneously moment to moment, watchfully, you will be coming closer. Without directly making any effort to move towards god you will be brought closer and closer. And one day suddenly you are god, one day suddenly the doors have opened.\nWhenever your awareness has risen to a point of one hundred degrees, the transformation happens on its own accord.\nPrem means love, deshana means a sermon – a sermon of love. Love can be taught only through life. Love cannot be condensed into a theory; it is too alive a phenomenon to be condensed into a theory. It is so vast that it cannot be confined within any words, and it is so mysterious that all words will be inadequate in expressing it. It is the ultimate mystery.\nBut one can teach it by one’s life; and then one’s whole life becomes a sermon of love. Live in such a way that each act of your life becomes an act of love, and that’s enough. That is prayer; nothing more is needed. If we have loved the world immensely our love reaches to god, because it is his creation and he is hidden behind all his creations. So wherever we pour our love it reaches to him; it can’t go anywhere else. Just as all rivers reach to the ocean, all acts of love reach to god. We are small rivers of love and he is the ocean.\nConsciously live a life of love: that is my message to you. Let that become your initiation into sannyas.\nAnd remember: children cannot love much because their love is a need, they are helpless. Love is a nourishment; they need it, they cannot give it. At the most, they can pretend to give.\nFor the young, love is a lust. They give, but they give only to get. Children cannot give, they only get; young people give and get.\nThe ultimate is left for the older people: they can give without asking anything in return.\nThat is the highest peak of love: when you give for the simple joy of giving; that is maturity. It is because of this fact that all ancient societies worship the older people, because love can reach to the highest peak and climax only in old age.\n[A sannyasin, leaving, says: My heart is a bit heavy.]\nHeavy? That’s a good sign. When you have a heart, then only can it be heavy! Many people don’t have any heart.\nIt is good! The heart is growing, so it is becoming heavy; no need to be worried. It is difficult to go, that’s why. But you will be doing my work this time, so devote as much time as you can to doing my work.\n[The sannyasin had previously written a letter about introducing cathartic meditations into this strange kind of place. He was afraid of someone cracking up.]\nNo, don’t be afraid... don’t be afraid: simply introduce it. I will be continuously helping you; just introduce it. People are in need – just introduce meditations and you will find people coming, and you will find people very sympathetic; don’t be worried at all. It is something that is going to grip the mind in the future sooner or later.\nWe may be a little early, but that’s all, so that’s not a problem at all. Those who have intelligence will be immediately attracted. And never care about the stupid. It is good that they are not attracted, because whenever they are attracted to something that means that thing is also stupid. Intelligent people will be attracted and in the West you will find many many people simply ready, just waiting for something and not knowing what it is, groping in the dark. If you show them a small light they will start coming.\nYou will be surprised that when you start helping people you are learning many things about meditation that you were not aware of. You knew them, but only when you start teaching people do you become aware, because then you have to articulate many things which may be just deep in the unconscious somewhere lurking like shadows. You have to bring them up, you have to verbalise them, you have to give them form. And suddenly when you give them a form you also become aware that you have known this, but you were not aware of it.\nThe best way to learn meditation is to teach it. And higher things can only be learned by teaching; the higher they are, the more it is so. Unless you start communicating, your own experiences will remain cloudy, hidden in a kind of mist; there is no need to bring them into the light. But when you have to convince the other you have to bring them into the light – and for the first time you also become clearly aware of what it is.\nSo it is going to be a help to you too, a tremendous help; and you are one of the best educational institutions there, so many many people will be simply ready to accept. You just have to gather a\nlittle courage and go out. In the beginning only, just reach a few friends, collect them, and then the thing starts moving on its own and I will be with you!\n[A sannyasin who is involved in artistic activities, and also introducing Osho to people in the West, asks if she is able to do so many things at the same time.]\nYou are! Everybody is really able to do many things, so many things that you cannot conceive of it. Because we live at the very minimum we don’t use more than seven per cent of our potential. So whatsoever you are doing, you can do at least ten times more very easily; and if you make a little more effort then fifteen times more. And the beauty is the more you do, the more energy you have to do.\nWe never become aware of our immense potential because we never give it any challenge. Give yourself as many challenges as possible. Life is short and it flees fast, it goes on slipping out of your hands. The moment that it is gone, it is gone, but if you can use it creatively then the moment will be gone but you have squeezed all the juice out of it. You will be enriched: the moment will be gone, but it will leave a tremendous treasure for you.\nIf a man has really lived totally then by the time he dies he takes a kingdom with him. He does not go empty-handed; only Alexander goes empty-handed, not Buddha.\nSo don’t be worried. Take on as many challenges as possible. And this is my experience the people who are doing many things always have time to do many more things. The people who are not doing anything have no time at all! If you tell them to do something, they say ‘We have no time, no energy.’ And they are right in a way because their energy remains unchallenged, in a kind of entropy, in a kind of sleep.\nProvoke your energy from every nook and comer, and you will become aflame. And to live like a torch burning from both ends together is the right and only way to live. Immense is the blessing of the person who lives totally.\nMan has a multi-dimensional being. YoU can do many, many things. And remember, all great discoveries in the world are made by people who do many kinds of things. Out of those many kinds of things a kind of cross-breeding happens. For example, if a mathematician starts painting, then no painter will be able to do the things that he does; because mathematics will be there somewhere. If he is also a musician then his painting will have another dimension to it; something of music will be there, music in colours. If he is a lover also, then something of love will also be in the painting, and so on and so forth. If he is only a painter the painting will be flat, it will be one-dimensional, it will not have depth. Maybe technically it is very correct, but only technically correct. It will not be a great work of art, it will not be a creation.\nIt is just as when men and women meet and a child is born. When men and women of different races meet, a far better child is born, because the woman brings all the culture from her side – a different culture, a different climate, a different vision – and the father brings a different culture, a different climate, a different language. The child becomes a meeting point, and certainly the child will have a richer life.\nPeople should not marry in their own country, they should not marry in the same church, they should not marry people of the same colour. Marriages should be as far away as possible. If you can find Martians, marry them! Marriages should be inter-planetary; and once we have discovered people on other planets this is going to happen! A totally different kind of child will be born: he will be a mutant, he will bring a new humanity into the world.\nThat’s how all inventions happen. A musician simply starts painting, a painter starts composing music; then something is bound to happen.\nSo try as many things as possible. They will all contribute, they will all make you richer and richer, and multi-dimensional.\n[A sannyasin says: I’m feeling fragile to be in the energy of the West.]\nIt is natural, it is natural. Living here for so long makes you delicate, makes you feminine, makes you fragile, because that is the only way to be open to god, open to the universe; one has to be vulnerable. When you go out of this Buddhafield you will be a little afraid, because the world is hard, the world is masculine, the world is aggressive, and the West more so.\nBut don’t be worried. This fragility is not weakness: it is really a new kind of strength, it is feminine strength. And remember that the idea that woman is a weaker sex is utter nonsense. Woman is the stronger sex; man is weaker. In only one way is man not weaker and that is in a muscular way, in an animal way. Otherwise he is not stronger than woman.\nWomen live longer than men, five years more. They are more resistant to illness than men. More men than women go mad; one should have expected just vice versa. And more men than women commit suicide; although women talk about committing suicide they never do. And whenever they take pills also they always take them in a certain quantity.\nFeminine energy has its own strength. It is non-muscular, it is not that of an animal, it is not that of Mohammed Ali. It is of a Buddha, it is vulnerable, fragile, but tremendously powerful.\nSo don’t be worried at all. You will be able to face the West, and without being in conflict. You will be able to remain as you are without being destroyed. And you need not protect yourself either, you need not grow a protective armour around yourself. The energy in itself is enough: it has its own power, hidden, secret, not on the surface but at the very centre.\nSo no need to worry. Just go, and I will see that everything remains as it is.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3112","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/zorba_the_buddha/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/zorba_the_buddha/>Zorba The Buddha</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">10</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3112 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Zorba_The_Buddha/part10.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

the truth, and to know the truth is to ke liberated.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth liberates, naked truth liberates. [Upgeya means to be
celebrated.]</p><p>Life is a gift to be celebrated, a gift which we go on taking for
granted, for which we don’t feel any thankfulness. And that is the only
sin: not to feel grateful to the whole for giving such a precious,
immensely valuable gift. We cannot pay for it, and because we cannot pay
for it – there is no way to pay – we can only be in a tremendous
thankfulness. Because we cannot pay for it, religion is born.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is nothing but gratefulness, and this gratefulness can be
expressed only through celebration. It should not be just verbal, it
should be in your dance, it should be in your very being. It can’t be
just a thank you to god; that will be too poor. Words cannot convey
anything, you have to become the thank you.</p><p>That is the meaning of upgeya: when one feels so grateful that one
dances in gratefulness; and that’s my whole teaching here.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine, parinita means married to – married to the divine.
Unless that happens, nothing happens. Unless one starts moving in deep
love with the whole, all other loves fail. They fail only because the
desire is for the whole. If you understand it they can’t fail; they
become stepping-stones. Then each lover is a ray of god, each love is a
small dew-drop of the same immense ocean. Then nothing fails, everything
succeeds, and everything becomes part of the great context. Everything
becomes a step and it takes you higher and higher. But the vision should
be clear, that one is married to god. All other marriages are on the
way; all other love affairs are part of the great love affair with
god.</p><p><br></p><p>Let sannyas be the beginning of this great love affair. Sannyas is
true only if it becomes a marriage to the divine.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means god, upnita means brought close to.</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas is a bridge to bring you close to god. It is not a religion:
it is a way, a way of life. It has no creed; it is a simple
understanding, with no philosophy, with no theology, with no dogma. It
is a way of living life naturally, spontaneously, consciously; but that
becomes the bridge.</p><p><br></p><p>Then slowly, slowly you go on coming closer and closer to god. You
don’t know where god is so you cannot move directly towards god. But if
you become aware, alert, authentic, and you live spontaneously moment to
moment, watchfully, you will be coming closer. Without directly making
any effort to move towards god you will be brought closer and closer.
And one day suddenly you are god, one day suddenly the doors have
opened.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever your awareness has risen to a point of one hundred degrees,
the transformation happens on its own accord.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem means love, deshana means a sermon – a sermon of love. Love can
be taught only through life. Love cannot be condensed into a theory; it
is too alive a phenomenon to be condensed into a theory. It is so vast
that it cannot be confined within any words, and it is so mysterious
that all words will be inadequate in expressing it. It is the ultimate
mystery.</p><p><br></p><p>But one can teach it by one’s life; and then one’s whole life becomes
a sermon of love. Live in such a way that each act of your life becomes
an act of love, and that’s enough. That is prayer; nothing more is
needed. If we have loved the world immensely our love reaches to god,
because it is his creation and he is hidden behind all his creations. So
wherever we pour our love it reaches to him; it can’t go anywhere else.
Just as all rivers reach to the ocean, all acts of love reach to god. We
are small rivers of love and he is the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>Consciously live a life of love: that is my message to you. Let that
become your initiation into sannyas.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember: children cannot love much because their love is a need,
they are helpless. Love is a nourishment; they need it, they cannot give
it. At the most, they can pretend to give.</p><p>For the young, love is a lust. They give, but they give only to get.
Children cannot give, they only get; young people give and get.</p><p><br></p><p>The ultimate is left for the older people: they can give without
asking anything in return.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the highest peak of love: when you give for the simple joy of
giving; that is maturity. It is because of this fact that all ancient
societies worship the older people, because love can reach to the
highest peak and climax only in old age.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin, leaving, says: My heart is a bit heavy.]</p><p><br></p><p>Heavy? That’s a good sign. When you have a heart, then only can it be
heavy! Many people don’t have any heart.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good! The heart is growing, so it is becoming heavy; no need to
be worried. It is difficult to go, that’s why. But you will be doing my
work this time, so devote as much time as you can to doing my work.</p><p><br></p><p>[The sannyasin had previously written a letter about introducing
cathartic meditations into this strange kind of place. He was afraid of
someone cracking up.]</p><p><br></p><p>No, don’t be afraid... don’t be afraid: simply introduce it. I will
be continuously helping you; just introduce it. People are in need –
just introduce meditations and you will find people coming, and you will
find people very sympathetic; don’t be worried at all. It is something
that is going to grip the mind in the future sooner or later.</p><p><br></p><p>We may be a little early, but that’s all, so that’s not a problem at
all. Those who have intelligence will be immediately attracted. And
never care about the stupid. It is good that they are not attracted,
because whenever they are attracted to something that means that thing
is also stupid. Intelligent people will be attracted and in the West you
will find many many people simply ready, just waiting for something and
not knowing what it is, groping in the dark. If you show them a small
light they will start coming.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised that when you start helping people you are
learning many things about meditation that you were not aware of. You
knew them, but only when you start teaching people do you become aware,
because then you have to articulate many things which may be just deep
in the unconscious somewhere lurking like shadows. You have to bring
them up, you have to verbalise them, you have to give them form. And
suddenly when you give them a form you also become aware that you have
known this, but you were not aware of it.</p><p><br></p><p>The best way to learn meditation is to teach it. And higher things
can only be learned by teaching; the higher they are, the more it is so.
Unless you start communicating, your own experiences will remain cloudy,
hidden in a kind of mist; there is no need to bring them into the light.
But when you have to convince the other you have to bring them into the
light – and for the first time you also become clearly aware of what it
is.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is going to be a help to you too, a tremendous help; and you
are one of the best educational institutions there, so many many people
will be simply ready to accept. You just have to gather a</p><p>little courage and go out. In the beginning only, just reach a few
friends, collect them, and then the thing starts moving on its own and I
will be with you!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin who is involved in artistic activities, and also
introducing Osho to people in the West, asks if she is able to do so
many things at the same time.]</p><p><br></p><p>You are! Everybody is really able to do many things, so many things
that you cannot conceive of it. Because we live at the very minimum we
don’t use more than seven per cent of our potential. So whatsoever you
are doing, you can do at least ten times more very easily; and if you
make a little more effort then fifteen times more. And the beauty is the
more you do, the more energy you have to do.</p><p><br></p><p>We never become aware of our immense potential because we never give
it any challenge. Give yourself as many challenges as possible. Life is
short and it flees fast, it goes on slipping out of your hands. The
moment that it is gone, it is gone, but if you can use it creatively
then the moment will be gone but you have squeezed all the juice out of
it. You will be enriched: the moment will be gone, but it will leave a
tremendous treasure for you.</p><p><br></p><p>If a man has really lived totally then by the time he dies he takes a
kingdom with him. He does not go empty-handed; only Alexander goes
empty-handed, not Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t be worried. Take on as many challenges as possible. And this
is my experience the people who are doing many things always have time
to do many more things. The people who are not doing anything have no
time at all! If you tell them to do something, they say ‘We have no
time, no energy.’ And they are right in a way because their energy
remains unchallenged, in a kind of entropy, in a kind of sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Provoke your energy from every nook and comer, and you will become
aflame. And to live like a torch burning from both ends together is the
right and only way to live. Immense is the blessing of the person who
lives totally.</p><p><br></p><p>Man has a multi-dimensional being. YoU can do many, many things. And
remember, all great discoveries in the world are made by people who do
many kinds of things. Out of those many kinds of things a kind of
cross-breeding happens. For example, if a mathematician starts painting,
then no painter will be able to do the things that he does; because
mathematics will be there somewhere. If he is also a musician then his
painting will have another dimension to it; something of music will be
there, music in colours. If he is a lover also, then something of love
will also be in the painting, and so on and so forth. If he is only a
painter the painting will be flat, it will be one-dimensional, it will
not have depth. Maybe technically it is very correct, but only
technically correct. It will not be a great work of art, it will not be
a creation.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just as when men and women meet and a child is born. When men
and women of different races meet, a far better child is born, because
the woman brings all the culture from her side – a different culture, a
different climate, a different vision – and the father brings a
different culture, a different climate, a different language. The child
becomes a meeting point, and certainly the child will have a richer
life.</p><p>People should not marry in their own country, they should not marry
in the same church, they should not marry people of the same colour.
Marriages should be as far away as possible. If you can find Martians,
marry them! Marriages should be inter-planetary; and once we have
discovered people on other planets this is going to happen! A totally
different kind of child will be born: he will be a mutant, he will bring
a new humanity into the world.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s how all inventions happen. A musician simply starts painting,
a painter starts composing music; then something is bound to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>So try as many things as possible. They will all contribute, they
will all make you richer and richer, and multi-dimensional.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: I’m feeling fragile to be in the energy of the
West.]</p><p><br></p><p>It is natural, it is natural. Living here for so long makes you
delicate, makes you feminine, makes you fragile, because that is the
only way to be open to god, open to the universe; one has to be
vulnerable. When you go out of this Buddhafield you will be a little
afraid, because the world is hard, the world is masculine, the world is
aggressive, and the West more so.</p><p><br></p><p>But don’t be worried. This fragility is not weakness: it is really a
new kind of strength, it is feminine strength. And remember that the
idea that woman is a weaker sex is utter nonsense. Woman is the stronger
sex; man is weaker. In only one way is man not weaker and that is in a
muscular way, in an animal way. Otherwise he is not stronger than
woman.</p><p><br></p><p>Women live longer than men, five years more. They are more resistant
to illness than men. More men than women go mad; one should have
expected just vice versa. And more men than women commit suicide;
although women talk about committing suicide they never do. And whenever
they take pills also they always take them in a certain quantity.</p><p><br></p><p>Feminine energy has its own strength. It is non-muscular, it is not
that of an animal, it is not that of Mohammed Ali. It is of a Buddha, it
is vulnerable, fragile, but tremendously powerful.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t be worried at all. You will be able to face the West, and
without being in conflict. You will be able to remain as you are without
being destroyed. And you need not protect yourself either, you need not
grow a protective armour around yourself. The energy in itself is
enough: it has its own power, hidden, secret, not on the surface but at
the very centre.</p><p><br></p><p>So no need to worry. Just go, and I will see that everything remains
as it is.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

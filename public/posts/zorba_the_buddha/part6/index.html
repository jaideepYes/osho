Then love is pure, then love is god. And the more you give, the more you become capable of giving: it is an inexhaustible source in your being.\nEmpty yourself in love, and when you have emptied yourself in love, in that space god descends in you. And that is the reward. It does not come from the outside; it comes from the beyond. You love his world; he loves you. The only way to reach to god is by loving his world.\nDeva Kazua... means divine peace and harmony. Peace is never human, it is always divine. It does not happen in you, it comes to you; you can only be on the receiving end. It showers on you from the sky, from the heavens. If you are empty you will be able to become full of it. You cannot create it; anything created remains false, pseudo.\nMany people try to become peaceful, and they can attain to a certain kind of peace, but that is only a very thin layer around themselves, not even skin-deep. Scratch them a little and all peace is gone, all harmony is gone. It is a cultivated thing, it is like a painted face; it is not the original face or the true face. Truth always comes from the beyond. We cannot manufacture it, we cannot cultivate it, and that is the beauty of it.\nSo remember, one has not to become peaceful but only empty. In becoming empty you are becoming ready to receive it; and it always comes, it is always coming. Whenever it finds you empty, suddenly you are full of it.\nDeva Shingi... will mean: stretched by god and settled. And if you allow it, it is going to happen! The only thing is if you allow; that has to be done. God never interferes, but he is always ready to do all\nthat you desire, all that you pray for. But it can be done only with your co-operation. Your freedom is absolute. If you surrender, miracles can happen to you. If you resist then nothing is going to happen.\nThere are only two types of people in the world, those who resist arid those who surrender. The majority is of those who resist, hence the majority remains miserable. There are very few people who are courageous enough to surrender. It needs great guts to surrender. It seems paradoxical, but unless you have tremendous confidence in yourself you cannot surrender. The weak resist, the strong surrender. Those who suffer from an inferiority complex cannot surrender. They are always afraid and resisting. They know that if they surrender they will be lost. The man who has inner confidence in himself is ready to surrender. He knows that even if he surrenders, he will be there; there is a tacit trust in himself. And only those few people are fortunate people.\nOnce you surrender, god can do miracles in your life.\n[The new sannyasin says he wants to look at Osho for longer.]\nIn the morning talk, mm? you can look; and that will be of great help. Deva Ikuko... will mean: divine meaninglessness.\nLife really has no purpose, it has no meaning, and that’s the most beautiful and profound thing about it. To reduce it to some meaning is to make it mundane; it loses its sacredness.\nThe sound of running water has no meaning, the wind passing through the pine trees has no meaning, the waves of the ocean roaring have no meaning, the clouds and the thunder have no meaning.\nMeaning is a man-made thing. Remove man from existence and there will be no meaning left. Meaning is imagined, projected, and because it is a projected thing, again and again we will feel frustrated. Again and again we will come to know the truth: that the meaning we were giving to life was not true. Then one starts feeling cheated, one starts feeling worthless, accidental. And the reason is that we were searching for a meaning which is not there. If we don’t search for meaning there is no frustration. If we don’t search for meaning then there is nothing meaningless either: then things are simply as they are. Sometimes it is cloudy and sometimes it is very sunny; sometimes it is very silent and sometimes it is very noisy. Things are as they are, and one starts enjoying whatsoever is moment to moment.\nThat is the basic message of sannyas: to live life without any idea of purpose, meaning, profit, to just live it for the sheer joy of living it, loving it for the sheer joy of loving it. It is life for life’s sake: no goal, no purpose, no destination.\nGreat freedom happens. When you are free of the obsession for meaning, you are really freedom.\nSakina. It is a Sufi word, it means divine aura. Each person is surrounded by a divine aura, because our innermost core is made of pure light and it radiates. It even filters out of the gross body and creates an aura of light.\nAs you become more aware, the aura becomes stronger.\nThe deeper you go into yourself, the bigger the aura that starts happening around you. When one has reached to the very core of light one starts feeling ‘I am not made of a material body only but made of pure light.’ That’s why the word ‘enlightenment’ – when you have reached the very core of your being you are light, and that is enlightenment. Nobody becomes enlightened, you simply disappear in that light; nobody is left, only light is.\nBut even from the person who is fast asleep, a somnambulist, unconscious, a few rays go on filtering, and those who have eyes can see. Now scientifically also it is a proved phenomenon. Kirlian photography has been able to take photographs of auras. And not only do human beings have auras, but birds and animals, and not only birds and animals but even trees and rocks. Each being and each thing has a certain aura of its own, an energy-field. Of course, man has the most powerful energy-field, but we live totally unaware of it.\nLet this moment become a journey into the inner light. Think of yourself as made of light, feel yourself as made of light; walk as if you are made of light. Slowly slowly you will start getting in tune with your light, you will become harmonious with it. When you are ready, receptive, it starts showering more and more. And the experience of light in oneself becomes the experience of light in everybody else too. The deeper you can look into yourself, the deeper you will be able to look into other people too. Then everybody becomes transparent and the whole existence is nothing but an ocean of light. That is the experience of god.\nThe Koran says: God is light; and all old scriptures say that god is light. They say it because of this experience. But the first thing to know is ‘I am light.’\nChaitanyo means pure consciousness.\nMan is only partially conscious: only one-tenth of the mind is conscious, nine-tenths is unconscious. Only the tip of the iceberg is conscious and the rest is drowned in darkness. That creates a rift in our being. We cannot exist as one person; we exist as two persons. The conscious and unconscious have no meeting ground, they cannot meet. They are like light and darkness: they cannot mix. If one is there then the other is not there.\nSo whenever you are functioning consciously, the unconscious hides. And whenever, in the night, the conscious goes to sleep, the unconscious becomes very very vocal. All those dreams and nightmares and messages that come filtering up are from the unconscious. But the unconscious functions only when the conscious is not there. Whatsoever you decided consciously never reaches to the unconscious; and the power is in the hands of the unconscious because it is nine times more than the conscious. So people go on deciding and the unconscious goes on undeciding. They go on proposing and the unconscious goes on disposing.\nThere are only two possibilities to become one organic unity, and to be one organic unity is to be healthy, sane; otherwise one remains schizophrenic, split. It is as if one of my hands goes on doing things which the other hand does not know of. Then the other hand goes on doing things which my first hand does not know of. Sometimes it happens that I build something with one hand and unbuild with another. The whole of life remains just a zigzag, a hotchpotch, chaos. One never arrives anywhere. One walks, runs, travels, but nothing ever seems to really happen, because those two parts go on cancelling each other.\nThere are two possibilities: one is to let the conscious also disappear into the unconscious, to be drowned. That’s what happens when one takes alcohol and drugs. That is one way of becoming sane, by losing consciousness. But you cannot remain in that state for long, you will have to come out of it, and whenever you come out of it again there is duality, again struggle and conflict. This conscious part cannot be drowned now in the unconscious; only for moments can we push it down through chemical drugs. But once those drugs wear off, the consciousness will come hack again.\nThe only way to become really whole is to make the unconscious conscious; and that is the whole work of meditation. That’s why all meditations and all meditative masters and all meditative techniques are against drugs, for only this simple reason, because drugs do just the opposite. They destroy the conscious and drown it in the unconscious. And meditation moves from the other pole: it helps the unconscious to become conscious and to be drowned in consciousness. That is the meaning of chaitanyo: becoming totally conscious.\nLong is the journey, arduous is the path, but tremendous is the benefit, tremendous is the blessing. And as you see more and more unconsciousness turning into consciousness, more and more joy, more and more calmness, more and more collectedness, starts happening of its own accord.\nSo let this be the seed-work upon yourself, the basic work upon yourself: become more and more conscious, do everything consciously. Slowly slowly, just small chunks of unconsciousness jump into consciousness. And just a small part of the unconscious claimed by the consciousness is such a benediction that we don’t have anything else to compare it with. The sexual orgasm is nothing compared to the orgasm that happens when a small chunk of unconsciousness becomes consciousness. Once you have become capable of changing small pieces of unconsciousness, you know the knack. Then sooner or later you will be able to bring the whole unconscious into light. That day is a day of great rejoicing.\nVeet means beyond, shabdo means the word, the scripture, knowledge – beyond all words.\nWords have to be dropped, one has to empty oneself of words. The inner talk has to be stopped. That is the only barrier between you and god, between you and existence, between you and your real you. The only barrier, a very thin barrier, is that of words. We are constantly thinking inside; that constant thinking goes on keeping us away from that which is.\nThe whole art of meditation consists of only one thing: creating gaps, creating windows, so that you can look without words, so that your eyes are empty and you can look through that emptiness. In that emptiness one becomes aware of the immense beauty of existence, of the great silence that surrounds it and of the great music which is constantly there. Then each moment becomes precious, golden. And slowly slowly you can create bigger and bigger windows.\nThe only thing that has to be done is this: whenever words are passing, witness them. Be very attentive, be very together there. Just look at the words, and words start disappearing, they melt. They start melting like ice melting in the hot sun. When your gaze is hot, when you are very concentratedly, intensely, looking at the words, they start melting and rushing away. They are very shy of attention. They cannot face your attentiveness; and that is the key.\nNiyazo means prayer. Prayer is the highest form of love. Prayer has nothing to do with so-called\nprayers; they are all of the head, and prayer can only be of the heart. The so-called prayers are only words, and real prayer can only be silent.\nGod knows everything, there is no need to say anything. He knows before we have said it, so what is the point of saying it? Prayer need not be a dialogue: prayer has to be a silent communion. Nothing has to be said, nothing has to be asked, nothing has to be desired, because all is already given, everything is already provided for. God already cares. Even to thank him will not be right. It is better to bow down in silence. The best way is to be utterly quiet, unmoving.\nIn that unmoving silence, when you are not saying anything, for the first time you start hearing the voice of god. It can be heard only in that great silence, in that profound silence. It is a very still small voice in your heart. When all the noise has stopped suddenly you become aware of it. The heart starts speaking to you. The heart becomes a flute on god’s lips. And then too, remember, the message is not delivered in words; the message is delivered but without words. You are overwhelmed by an immense feeling of gratitude, you are overwhelmed by the presence of truth, but it is all non-verbal. It is a feel, it is an experience.\n[An Indian sannyasin asks if there is anything he can do ‘from his part of the world’.]\nYou have to do much for me there. You have to become my messenger there. You have come because you have been called. You have not come on your own; you have been pulled, you have come in spite of yourself. So much has to be done. You have to become a vehicle. Something of great import is happening here; it has to be spread to as many people as possible. And it will bring great bliss to you if you can share it.\nThere is nothing more significant than sharing truth, love, meditation. You will learn much by helping people to meditate. You will become aware of great energies in yourself the moment you start helping those who need help. And everybody is in great need of spiritual help because everybody is hungry, and this world is not satisfying at all.\nUltimately, everything of this world simply proves to be a toy. It keeps you engaged, true, but that’s all it does, and sooner or later there is the disillusionment. Then the disillusionment is very shattering because you have wasted your whole life, and by the time you are disillusioned by life the opportunity has slipped out of your hands; now nothing can be done.\nSo make people aware that money is not going to satisfy, that power is not going to satisfy, that prestige is not going to satisfy. Only one thing can satisfy, and that is god. You can call it truth, you can call it love; those are just names. Only one thing can bring contentment, and that is becoming aware of who you are. The moment you become aware of who you are, immediately all the mysteries of existence are open to you. The whole kingdom is yours, and has always been yours. Then something happens which is going to abide with you; even death cannot take it away. A man is fulfilled only when he has come to something which cannot be taken away by death.\nSo help people, and come back for a longer period.\n[A sannyasin says: When I am meditating there is so much noise. It’s as if my mind is becoming stronger and stronger.]\nIt is not becoming stronger. You are becoming more aware of it, hence it looks as if it is becoming stronger. One has to become aware of it, only then can it go.\nOrdinarily we remain oblivious to it. It goes on there like an undercurrent; at the back it continues. You remain occupied with a thousand and one things in the outside world. But when you meditate then you turn in and you start looking at the mind. Ordinarily the mind is behind you, and when you meditate the mind is confronted, you encounter your mind; and of course when you encounter it you see all the madness inside. It has always been there. Meditation cannot create it, meditation can only show it to you. Only when you are meditating will you become aware of this noise. The noise will become more and more – not that it is becoming more and more, it is just that you are becoming more and more aware. So your depth of awareness will bring the whole of your mind in front of you.\nThis is beautiful, this is how it should be. When yoU have become aware of the total mind and its total madness then the change will happen. Then one day suddenly the mind has started going away.\nSo don’t be worried, this happens to every meditator. Continue meditating. Within three to six months you will see the mind disappearing. the noise becoming less and less and less, and silence arising. Just continue to meditate.\n[A sannyasin says when he returns to his job as a Catholic religious teacher, he will do the Centering group and maybe the Sufi dance... but he will need the energy.]\nDo everything!\nEnergy will be available to you. I will be there – just do everything that you want to do. And don’t be worried: just tell those people who will try to create trouble, you that now you are really a Catholic, now you are working directly with Jesus and you don’t care about the mediators. At the most the job will be lost; it is nothing to be worried about! Just enjoy it... and I will be there with you.\n[A sannyasin had previously written to say that when she knew that her cousin tried to commit suicide she was very upset.]\nThat’s natural. But these things are part of life, death is part of life. Sometimes it happens that a person who has no other way to assert his ego chooses suicide as an assertion of the ego. It is a way of saying to the world ‘I can do something.’ It is simply the greatest egoistic thing that one can do. Birth you cannot choose; suddenly you are here, you had not chosen to be, nobody had asked you. The only thing that you can choose is death. So sometimes very intelligent people commit suicide or try to commit suicide. That is their way of saying to existence, ‘At least my death will not be an accident. I will choose it myself.’\nIt is nothing to be worried about. And whether one commits suicide or not, one is going to die anyway, death is going to happen. Death is disturbing, but death disturbs only because you also are afraid of death.\nAnd another problem: whatsoever you are afraid of, you are also attracted towards it. Fear and attraction are two aspects of the same coin: the more you are afraid, the more you are attracted. If you are unafraid, there is no attraction; if there is no attraction, there is no fear either.\nSo this is a good situation for you to meditate on. You became upset and you were angry at me. This is natural, but this simply brought up something inside you. You have to meditate more about yourself. You have to see more that you are afraid of death, that you may be attracted to it. And you have to see that much work is needed before one can drop these attractions and fears. One has to become very alert, aware.\nOnly when one knows ‘I am not the body’ does the fear and attraction of death disappear. And this is the whole work for a sannyasin to do. This is the discipline of the sannyasin, to know ‘I am not the body, I am not the mind.’ Use every opportunity, and there will be many opportunities: a friend will die, a brother may try to commit suicide, some acquaintance may have an accident. These things are going to happen because they are happening all over the place. And even if nothing happens, then too death is going to come. Whether it happens in bed or it happens on the road, what difference does it make? Whether you choose it or it chooses you, what difference does it make?\nBut we have to meditate upon these problems; these are interior problems. It has nothing to do with your cousin-brother: it has something to do with your own mind. It is good that he created a situation and that he disturbed all kinds of things in you. Now, don’t repress them: throw them out of your system. Use this time that you are here to throw all these toxins, poisons out of your system. Be cleansed of all these things. And it is possible.\nPrem means love, anando means bliss. Love is the seed, bliss is the flowering of it, and only those who love, and love abundantly, can attain to bliss.\nPeople try to attain to bliss without going deeply into love. Love seems to be risky, dangerous. And people are very miserly too: love means sharing, giving, and they don’t want to give. They want to get, they want to get bliss, but bliss comes only to those who can give themselves totally in love. Only by giving yourself totally in love to god, to god’s existence, do you earn bliss.\nBliss is a crescendo, love is the ladder. So unless one is really to die in love one never attains to bliss. And the whole world is in so much misery because everybody is trying to attain to bliss without sacrificing anything in love.\nSo remember that: Love is the key to god’s door.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3781","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/zorba_the_buddha/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/zorba_the_buddha/>Zorba The Buddha</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">6</h1><div class=post-meta>18 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3781 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Zorba_The_Buddha/part6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

is gone. It is a cultivated thing, it is like a painted face; it is not
the original face or the true face. Truth always comes from the beyond.
We cannot manufacture it, we cannot cultivate it, and that is the beauty
of it.</p><p><br></p><p>So remember, one has not to become peaceful but only empty. In
becoming empty you are becoming ready to receive it; and it always
comes, it is always coming. Whenever it finds you empty, suddenly you
are full of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva Shingi... will mean: stretched by god and settled. And if you
allow it, it is going to happen! The only thing is if you allow; that
has to be done. God never interferes, but he is always ready to do
all</p><p>that you desire, all that you pray for. But it can be done only with
your co-operation. Your freedom is absolute. If you surrender, miracles
can happen to you. If you resist then nothing is going to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>There are only two types of people in the world, those who resist
arid those who surrender. The majority is of those who resist, hence the
majority remains miserable. There are very few people who are courageous
enough to surrender. It needs great guts to surrender. It seems
paradoxical, but unless you have tremendous confidence in yourself you
cannot surrender. The weak resist, the strong surrender. Those who
suffer from an inferiority complex cannot surrender. They are always
afraid and resisting. They know that if they surrender they will be
lost. The man who has inner confidence in himself is ready to surrender.
He knows that even if he surrenders, he will be there; there is a tacit
trust in himself. And only those few people are fortunate people.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you surrender, god can do miracles in your life.</p><p><br></p><p>[The new sannyasin says he wants to look at Osho for longer.]</p><p><br></p><p>In the morning talk, mm? you can look; and that will be of great
help. Deva Ikuko... will mean: divine meaninglessness.</p><p>Life really has no purpose, it has no meaning, and that’s the most
beautiful and profound thing about it. To reduce it to some meaning is
to make it mundane; it loses its sacredness.</p><p><br></p><p>The sound of running water has no meaning, the wind passing through
the pine trees has no meaning, the waves of the ocean roaring have no
meaning, the clouds and the thunder have no meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>Meaning is a man-made thing. Remove man from existence and there will
be no meaning left. Meaning is imagined, projected, and because it is a
projected thing, again and again we will feel frustrated. Again and
again we will come to know the truth: that the meaning we were giving to
life was not true. Then one starts feeling cheated, one starts feeling
worthless, accidental. And the reason is that we were searching for a
meaning which is not there. If we don’t search for meaning there is no
frustration. If we don’t search for meaning then there is nothing
meaningless either: then things are simply as they are. Sometimes it is
cloudy and sometimes it is very sunny; sometimes it is very silent and
sometimes it is very noisy. Things are as they are, and one starts
enjoying whatsoever is moment to moment.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the basic message of sannyas: to live life without any idea
of purpose, meaning, profit, to just live it for the sheer joy of living
it, loving it for the sheer joy of loving it. It is life for life’s
sake: no goal, no purpose, no destination.</p><p><br></p><p>Great freedom happens. When you are free of the obsession for
meaning, you are really freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>Sakina. It is a Sufi word, it means divine aura. Each person is
surrounded by a divine aura, because our innermost core is made of pure
light and it radiates. It even filters out of the gross body and creates
an aura of light.</p><p><br></p><p>As you become more aware, the aura becomes stronger.</p><p>The deeper you go into yourself, the bigger the aura that starts
happening around you. When one has reached to the very core of light one
starts feeling ‘I am not made of a material body only but made of pure
light.’ That’s why the word ‘enlightenment’ – when you have reached the
very core of your being you are light, and that is enlightenment. Nobody
becomes enlightened, you simply disappear in that light; nobody is left,
only light is.</p><p><br></p><p>But even from the person who is fast asleep, a somnambulist,
unconscious, a few rays go on filtering, and those who have eyes can
see. Now scientifically also it is a proved phenomenon. Kirlian
photography has been able to take photographs of auras. And not only do
human beings have auras, but birds and animals, and not only birds and
animals but even trees and rocks. Each being and each thing has a
certain aura of its own, an energy-field. Of course, man has the most
powerful energy-field, but we live totally unaware of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Let this moment become a journey into the inner light. Think of
yourself as made of light, feel yourself as made of light; walk as if
you are made of light. Slowly slowly you will start getting in tune with
your light, you will become harmonious with it. When you are ready,
receptive, it starts showering more and more. And the experience of
light in oneself becomes the experience of light in everybody else too.
The deeper you can look into yourself, the deeper you will be able to
look into other people too. Then everybody becomes transparent and the
whole existence is nothing but an ocean of light. That is the experience
of god.</p><p><br></p><p>The Koran says: God is light; and all old scriptures say that god is
light. They say it because of this experience. But the first thing to
know is ‘I am light.’</p><p><br></p><p>Chaitanyo means pure consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is only partially conscious: only one-tenth of the mind is
conscious, nine-tenths is unconscious. Only the tip of the iceberg is
conscious and the rest is drowned in darkness. That creates a rift in
our being. We cannot exist as one person; we exist as two persons. The
conscious and unconscious have no meeting ground, they cannot meet. They
are like light and darkness: they cannot mix. If one is there then the
other is not there.</p><p><br></p><p>So whenever you are functioning consciously, the unconscious hides.
And whenever, in the night, the conscious goes to sleep, the unconscious
becomes very very vocal. All those dreams and nightmares and messages
that come filtering up are from the unconscious. But the unconscious
functions only when the conscious is not there. Whatsoever you decided
consciously never reaches to the unconscious; and the power is in the
hands of the unconscious because it is nine times more than the
conscious. So people go on deciding and the unconscious goes on
undeciding. They go on proposing and the unconscious goes on
disposing.</p><p><br></p><p>There are only two possibilities to become one organic unity, and to
be one organic unity is to be healthy, sane; otherwise one remains
schizophrenic, split. It is as if one of my hands goes on doing things
which the other hand does not know of. Then the other hand goes on doing
things which my first hand does not know of. Sometimes it happens that I
build something with one hand and unbuild with another. The whole of
life remains just a zigzag, a hotchpotch, chaos. One never arrives
anywhere. One walks, runs, travels, but nothing ever seems to really
happen, because those two parts go on cancelling each other.</p><p>There are two possibilities: one is to let the conscious also
disappear into the unconscious, to be drowned. That’s what happens when
one takes alcohol and drugs. That is one way of becoming sane, by losing
consciousness. But you cannot remain in that state for long, you will
have to come out of it, and whenever you come out of it again there is
duality, again struggle and conflict. This conscious part cannot be
drowned now in the unconscious; only for moments can we push it down
through chemical drugs. But once those drugs wear off, the consciousness
will come hack again.</p><p><br></p><p>The only way to become really whole is to make the unconscious
conscious; and that is the whole work of meditation. That’s why all
meditations and all meditative masters and all meditative techniques are
against drugs, for only this simple reason, because drugs do just the
opposite. They destroy the conscious and drown it in the unconscious.
And meditation moves from the other pole: it helps the unconscious to
become conscious and to be drowned in consciousness. That is the meaning
of chaitanyo: becoming totally conscious.</p><p><br></p><p>Long is the journey, arduous is the path, but tremendous is the
benefit, tremendous is the blessing. And as you see more and more
unconsciousness turning into consciousness, more and more joy, more and
more calmness, more and more collectedness, starts happening of its own
accord.</p><p><br></p><p>So let this be the seed-work upon yourself, the basic work upon
yourself: become more and more conscious, do everything consciously.
Slowly slowly, just small chunks of unconsciousness jump into
consciousness. And just a small part of the unconscious claimed by the
consciousness is such a benediction that we don’t have anything else to
compare it with. The sexual orgasm is nothing compared to the orgasm
that happens when a small chunk of unconsciousness becomes
consciousness. Once you have become capable of changing small pieces of
unconsciousness, you know the knack. Then sooner or later you will be
able to bring the whole unconscious into light. That day is a day of
great rejoicing.</p><p><br></p><p>Veet means beyond, shabdo means the word, the scripture, knowledge –
beyond all words.</p><p><br></p><p>Words have to be dropped, one has to empty oneself of words. The
inner talk has to be stopped. That is the only barrier between you and
god, between you and existence, between you and your real you. The only
barrier, a very thin barrier, is that of words. We are constantly
thinking inside; that constant thinking goes on keeping us away from
that which is.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole art of meditation consists of only one thing: creating
gaps, creating windows, so that you can look without words, so that your
eyes are empty and you can look through that emptiness. In that
emptiness one becomes aware of the immense beauty of existence, of the
great silence that surrounds it and of the great music which is
constantly there. Then each moment becomes precious, golden. And slowly
slowly you can create bigger and bigger windows.</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing that has to be done is this: whenever words are
passing, witness them. Be very attentive, be very together there. Just
look at the words, and words start disappearing, they melt. They start
melting like ice melting in the hot sun. When your gaze is hot, when you
are very concentratedly, intensely, looking at the words, they start
melting and rushing away. They are very shy of attention. They cannot
face your attentiveness; and that is the key.</p><p><br></p><p>Niyazo means prayer. Prayer is the highest form of love. Prayer has
nothing to do with so-called</p><p>prayers; they are all of the head, and prayer can only be of the
heart. The so-called prayers are only words, and real prayer can only be
silent.</p><p><br></p><p>God knows everything, there is no need to say anything. He knows
before we have said it, so what is the point of saying it? Prayer need
not be a dialogue: prayer has to be a silent communion. Nothing has to
be said, nothing has to be asked, nothing has to be desired, because all
is already given, everything is already provided for. God already cares.
Even to thank him will not be right. It is better to bow down in
silence. The best way is to be utterly quiet, unmoving.</p><p><br></p><p>In that unmoving silence, when you are not saying anything, for the
first time you start hearing the voice of god. It can be heard only in
that great silence, in that profound silence. It is a very still small
voice in your heart. When all the noise has stopped suddenly you become
aware of it. The heart starts speaking to you. The heart becomes a flute
on god’s lips. And then too, remember, the message is not delivered in
words; the message is delivered but without words. You are overwhelmed
by an immense feeling of gratitude, you are overwhelmed by the presence
of truth, but it is all non-verbal. It is a feel, it is an
experience.</p><p><br></p><p>[An Indian sannyasin asks if there is anything he can do ‘from his
part of the world’.]</p><p><br></p><p>You have to do much for me there. You have to become my messenger
there. You have come because you have been called. You have not come on
your own; you have been pulled, you have come in spite of yourself. So
much has to be done. You have to become a vehicle. Something of great
import is happening here; it has to be spread to as many people as
possible. And it will bring great bliss to you if you can share it.</p><p><br></p><p>There is nothing more significant than sharing truth, love,
meditation. You will learn much by helping people to meditate. You will
become aware of great energies in yourself the moment you start helping
those who need help. And everybody is in great need of spiritual help
because everybody is hungry, and this world is not satisfying at
all.</p><p><br></p><p>Ultimately, everything of this world simply proves to be a toy. It
keeps you engaged, true, but that’s all it does, and sooner or later
there is the disillusionment. Then the disillusionment is very
shattering because you have wasted your whole life, and by the time you
are disillusioned by life the opportunity has slipped out of your hands;
now nothing can be done.</p><p><br></p><p>So make people aware that money is not going to satisfy, that power
is not going to satisfy, that prestige is not going to satisfy. Only one
thing can satisfy, and that is god. You can call it truth, you can call
it love; those are just names. Only one thing can bring contentment, and
that is becoming aware of who you are. The moment you become aware of
who you are, immediately all the mysteries of existence are open to you.
The whole kingdom is yours, and has always been yours. Then something
happens which is going to abide with you; even death cannot take it
away. A man is fulfilled only when he has come to something which cannot
be taken away by death.</p><p><br></p><p>So help people, and come back for a longer period.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: When I am meditating there is so much noise. It’s
as if my mind is becoming stronger and stronger.]</p><p>It is not becoming stronger. You are becoming more aware of it, hence
it looks as if it is becoming stronger. One has to become aware of it,
only then can it go.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily we remain oblivious to it. It goes on there like an
undercurrent; at the back it continues. You remain occupied with a
thousand and one things in the outside world. But when you meditate then
you turn in and you start looking at the mind. Ordinarily the mind is
behind you, and when you meditate the mind is confronted, you encounter
your mind; and of course when you encounter it you see all the madness
inside. It has always been there. Meditation cannot create it,
meditation can only show it to you. Only when you are meditating will
you become aware of this noise. The noise will become more and more –
not that it is becoming more and more, it is just that you are becoming
more and more aware. So your depth of awareness will bring the whole of
your mind in front of you.</p><p><br></p><p>This is beautiful, this is how it should be. When yoU have become
aware of the total mind and its total madness then the change will
happen. Then one day suddenly the mind has started going away.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t be worried, this happens to every meditator. Continue
meditating. Within three to six months you will see the mind
disappearing. the noise becoming less and less and less, and silence
arising. Just continue to meditate.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says when he returns to his job as a Catholic religious
teacher, he will do the Centering group and maybe the Sufi dance... but
he will need the energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>Do everything!</p><p><br></p><p>Energy will be available to you. I will be there – just do everything
that you want to do. And don’t be worried: just tell those people who
will try to create trouble, you that now you are really a Catholic, now
you are working directly with Jesus and you don’t care about the
mediators. At the most the job will be lost; it is nothing to be worried
about! Just enjoy it... and I will be there with you.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin had previously written to say that when she knew that
her cousin tried to commit suicide she was very upset.]</p><p><br></p><p>That’s natural. But these things are part of life, death is part of
life. Sometimes it happens that a person who has no other way to assert
his ego chooses suicide as an assertion of the ego. It is a way of
saying to the world ‘I can do something.’ It is simply the greatest
egoistic thing that one can do. Birth you cannot choose; suddenly you
are here, you had not chosen to be, nobody had asked you. The only thing
that you can choose is death. So sometimes very intelligent people
commit suicide or try to commit suicide. That is their way of saying to
existence, ‘At least my death will not be an accident. I will choose it
myself.’</p><p><br></p><p>It is nothing to be worried about. And whether one commits suicide or
not, one is going to die anyway, death is going to happen. Death is
disturbing, but death disturbs only because you also are afraid of
death.</p><p><br></p><p>And another problem: whatsoever you are afraid of, you are also
attracted towards it. Fear and attraction are two aspects of the same
coin: the more you are afraid, the more you are attracted. If you are
unafraid, there is no attraction; if there is no attraction, there is no
fear either.</p><p>So this is a good situation for you to meditate on. You became upset
and you were angry at me. This is natural, but this simply brought up
something inside you. You have to meditate more about yourself. You have
to see more that you are afraid of death, that you may be attracted to
it. And you have to see that much work is needed before one can drop
these attractions and fears. One has to become very alert, aware.</p><p><br></p><p>Only when one knows ‘I am not the body’ does the fear and attraction
of death disappear. And this is the whole work for a sannyasin to do.
This is the discipline of the sannyasin, to know ‘I am not the body, I
am not the mind.’ Use every opportunity, and there will be many
opportunities: a friend will die, a brother may try to commit suicide,
some acquaintance may have an accident. These things are going to happen
because they are happening all over the place. And even if nothing
happens, then too death is going to come. Whether it happens in bed or
it happens on the road, what difference does it make? Whether you choose
it or it chooses you, what difference does it make?</p><p><br></p><p>But we have to meditate upon these problems; these are interior
problems. It has nothing to do with your cousin-brother: it has
something to do with your own mind. It is good that he created a
situation and that he disturbed all kinds of things in you. Now, don’t
repress them: throw them out of your system. Use this time that you are
here to throw all these toxins, poisons out of your system. Be cleansed
of all these things. And it is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem means love, anando means bliss. Love is the seed, bliss is the
flowering of it, and only those who love, and love abundantly, can
attain to bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>People try to attain to bliss without going deeply into love. Love
seems to be risky, dangerous. And people are very miserly too: love
means sharing, giving, and they don’t want to give. They want to get,
they want to get bliss, but bliss comes only to those who can give
themselves totally in love. Only by giving yourself totally in love to
god, to god’s existence, do you earn bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>Bliss is a crescendo, love is the ladder. So unless one is really to
die in love one never attains to bliss. And the whole world is in so
much misery because everybody is trying to attain to bliss without
sacrificing anything in love.</p><p><br></p><p>So remember that: Love is the key to god’s door.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

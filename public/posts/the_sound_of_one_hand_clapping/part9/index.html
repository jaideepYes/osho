to cover that wound one creates a pseudo climate around oneself of satisfaction and that's what the so-called religious people have been doing for centuries this is not the way to find truth the only way to find truth is to go through your discontent without hiding it, without escaping from it the very understanding of your discontentment brings contentment\nand then there is a totally new being, a new birth the noble one is born\nsatisfaction is a deception contentment is a resurrection but before the resurrection can happen one has to go through crucifixion if one avoids crucifixion\nthen one will be avoiding finally the ultimate rejoicing of being resurrected i teach contentment not satisfaction and the way to contentment is to encounter all your discontents without any fear, without any hiding to know your discontentment in its total nudity is the beginning of a new life man can create in two ways either out of a state of discontentment frustration, failure\nor through a state of absolute contentment the quality of the creativity is going to be totally different picasso may be a great painter but his painting shows his discontentment with life not contentment\nit shows his innermost insanity as if he has vomited his insanity on the canvas of course he is a great artist 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- but whatsoever he is creating is a little bit insane he is simply catharting\nit helps him, he becomes unburdened but it doesn't help others they will become burdened\nthe whole of modern art is rooted in discontentment hence it has lost the ancient glory, the classic glory of creativity\nthere is a vast difference between the people who made the taj mahal or the temples of khajuraho or the pyramids of egypt\nand the people who are creating modern art the gap seems to be unbridgeable because the sources are different it is said in zen\nthat before you can create you have to come to a point of absolute silence then whatsoever you do will bring something of the divine into the world you will become a vehicle\nthen it will not be just a mind product it will be something transcendental and that's my effort here\ni am all for creativity\nbut not this kind of creativity that is going around the world, neurotic, psychotic i would like my sannyasins to become so peaceful so silent\nso utterly at home with existence that there is no complaint in their being but only gratitude\nout of that gratitude flows real creativity and that is the greatest joy in life to contribute something to existence to make it a little more beautiful than you had found it\nto spread a few more smiles in the world to make the world more blessed, blissful in a state of better celebration, festivity if this can be done then the man is religious to me religion has nothing to do with churches and temples and rituals it has something to do\nwith the energy called creativity but before it can happen 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- one has to prepare one's being and contentment is the preparation be contented -- whatsoever is, is good whatsoever is, is perfect, don't ask for more relax into it, rejoice in it and you will be surprised\nthe more vou relax, the more you rest in it the more you become insightful of the mysterious of the miraculous that surrounds you a moment comes when you simply disappear in your own immense contentment and when you are not, god is when you are not, creativity is to me god is not a creator but only\nthe energy called creativity the cowardly is always complaining to complain, intelligence is not needed to complain, courage is not needed to complain is a very mediocre activity anybody can do it\nhence everybody is doing it but to be contented, to feel grateful, to feel blessed great intelligence is required courage is required, insight is required and the moment you start looking into the depths of life\na great surprise arises\nyou cannot believe it, it is incredible what has been given is simply beyond our comprehension\nand we have not earned it either it is a sheer gift from the whole to see life, love, freedom, joy as gifts from the divine\nmakes one feel contented\nand the atmosphere of inner contentment is the atmosphere of a real temple temples don't exist on the outside one has to become a temple and the only way to become a temple is to create in your interiority an immense gratitude for all that has happened to you for all that is happening to you and it is incalculable, immeasurable but certainly one has to be courageous for it 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- courageous because the whole crowd is complaining it is always asking for more it needs guts to say, i don't ask for more that in fact whatsoever is given to me is more than i could have asked for in the first place and from that very moment\na transformation starts happening your life becomes\nmore and more attuned to existence it becomes more and more a dance and that has to be the flavour of my sannyasins a deep inner contentment\nand on the outside\nthe manifestation of that contentment in celebration, in celebrating the day-to- day life\nthe moment-to-moment life the ordinary life\nonce you are ready\nto celebrate the ordinary life it is no more ordinary at all there are people who think that unless you attain to the ultimate bliss you cannot be contented\nthey have taken a wrong standpoint from the very beginning they will remain discontented forever contentment\nhas to be the first step of the journey contentment\nsimply means a non-egoistic attitude the ego is always asking for more it always needs more and more decorations it is never satisfied\nit is not in its nature to be satisfied the ego is a beggar\nand the ego can go on begging in this world it can start begging in the other world too a sannyasin has to start as an emperor not as a beggar\nthat has to be his first step 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- and that's what i mean by contentment the moment you say i am immensely happy with whatsoever is with the stars and the clouds and the trees and the people and with myself i have no grudge, no guilt no desire to be somebody else no desire to be somewhere else i rejoice whatsoever is the case.\nimmediately\nyou are transformed into an emperor and then bliss is not far away in fact it will come following you you need not search for it anutosh means contentment\ndhyan means meditation\nthey are equivalent, synonymous there exists a subtle synchronicity between them if you are contented\nthere is no need to meditate at all contentment will become your meditation naturally, spontaneously\nor vice versa -- if you are meditative, silent then contentment will become a by- product one can begin from either end it is in fact one phenomenon two ends of the same line\nthe easiest is to begin with contentment because there is so much to be contented with the whole universe provides millions of opportunities to be contented with those who cannot do it\nthey have to start by meditating meditation is an effort\nyou have to sit silently, watchfully, relaxedly to calm down your mind, your whole inner noise but if one starts with contentment it is far more simple\nlooking at the sky full of stars suddenly you feel so contented -- what more can there be?\nit cannot be improved upon the starry night is so breathtaking the sunset for a moment stops your heartbeat a bird on the wing and suddenly your mind is not there\nthese are natural glimpses of meditation my suggestion is watch life and its beauties get more and more merged into existence 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- and meditation will come naturally if it is not possible then only make an effort, a deliberate effort to be silent but that has always to be the second thing when the easier course is available don't follow the arduous; it is unnecessary follow the watercourse way there is no need to go upstream, go with the river and this very moment you can feel contentment if i say meditate\nyou will have to decide when to start tomorrow, tomorrow morning fix the alarm and tomorrow morning...\nbut if you understand\nwhat i am saying about contentment then it is there, right now this very moment\nis so full, so overwhelmingly full that one can easily get lost in it anutoshi means one who is absolutely contented so i am not leaving anything for you i am simply declaring\nyou can relax into it, nothing has to be done the very idea of doing\nis an invention of the mind otherwise all is happening but mind is so cunning\nthat even when things are happening it goes on translating them as if he is doing them\nfor example people say i am breathing you see the stupidity?\nnobody is breathing; breathing is happening if people were breathing\nthen it would be impossible for them to die they may continue breathing death may go on knocking on the door and they may go on doing the dynamic meditation then what to do?\nthey may even start breathing faster we are not breathing\nin fact just the opposite is the case we are being breathed, existence is breathing us and that is true about everything when you are hungry you are not hungry it has nothing to do with you, it is simply there and when you eat and you digest it has nothing to do with you it is not that you are digesting it just try for twenty- four hours to digest food 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- and you will have indigestion remember constantly where the food has gone now and where it is moving\nand go on touching your belly and find places now it must be here\nand now the bread is being churned into blood you will go crazy within twenty- four hours everything is happening\nthat is one of the fundamentals of my approach to life\nwe are not doers\nwe are just part of an immense happening so all that is needed on our part is to relax, rejoice, be in tune that's what i mean by absolute contentment then each moment brings so much ecstasy and the moment one feels contentment all problems disappear\nas if they had never existed in the first place uncontainable so immense\nthat one can simply dance in sheer gratitude my sannyasins are not dancing to attain to god they are not dancing to attain to heavenly pleasures they are dancing just out of sheer contentment there is nothing else to do it is not a means to some end in fact it is the recognition that all is already the case\nand we are here just to celebrate it we are asleep\nour sleep consists of discontentments the only way to wake up is to drop discontentments and it is very easy to drop them because they are futile\neven if you carry them\nyou will never be able to fulfil them\n]nobody has ever been able to fulfil his discontentments it is an exercise in sheer futility so the intelligent person\nsimply drops the whole trip he does not waste his present for any future 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- he does not sacrifice this moment for another moment who knows about the next moment?\nin fact the tomorrow never comes so why waste the time that is available to you for something which is not going to come?\nbut the discontented man lives int he future and the contented man lives in the present and to live in the present is to be awakened there is no other secret to it to live now\nto live here is to be awakened the unconscious person lives in dreams he goes on creating new dreams when old dreams fail\nhe immediately substitutes new dreams for them his life is made not of realities but only of desires the same stuff as dreams are made of he lives in a cocoon of false notions hallucinations, desires, expectations and this is simply a way of committing suicide a sannyasin has to come out of the cocoon he has to drop all nonsense of the mind and be in contact with reality, with that which is and the reality is really fulfilling just a single moment of the contact with reality is far more valuable\nthan the whole eternity of dreaming it is so nourishing\nthe method to come in contact with reality is consciousness\nbecause it is unconsciousness that prevents us so the whole work of a sannyasin is to move from unconscious states to conscious states\nslowly slowly changing every fibre of one's being from unconsciousness to consciousness and even if you can change a single moment then you have got the key\nyou can change your whole life only the first moment is a little bit difficult because of our old habits\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- for that first moment to happen a certain energy field is needed where many people are trying to become conscious their very fervour\ncreates a subtle whirlpool of energy around you it starts moving you\nthat's the whole purpose of a buddhafield that's the purpose of this commune so many people trying to be loving trying to be meditative, trying to be alert create a certain vibe which can possess anybody and once you have tasted a single moment then there is no problem\nthen you can move on your own the experience of contentment is not a dull experience\nit is one of the most brilliant experiences of life just shining like the sun\nhence your so-called saints who look dull, stupid, dead are giving enough proof\nthat they have not tasted contentment they are simply suffocating themselves they have created\na certain kind of satisfaction around themselves but satisfaction is always dull because it is a fabricated thing a manufactured thing\nit has no life, it has no song to it but when contentment explodes thousands of songs grow in you so that has to be the criterion of whether you are on the right road or not whether you are moving in the right direction or not if your song starts becoming deeper if your joy becomes more and more intense if your life starts taking a tremendous passionate love quality to it then that is enough proof, ample proof that you are coming closer to home there is a music which is heard only when you have reached\nthe innermost core of your being utterly contented 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- it is not ordinary music it is not heard by the ears it is heard by the soul itself but it is overwhelming\nthere is nothing bigger than that the moment one has experienced it one has experienced the vastest expanse of space even the whole sky seems to be very small compared to it\nthe millions of stars are nothing compared to the inner light and the expanding universe which goes on expanding\nevery moment with infinite speed is nothing compared to the inner expansion it can only be called music there is no other word\nwhich can adequately describe it the zen people call it the Sound\nof one hand Clapping\nit has to be heard\nwithout hearing it life is futile, meaningless one can only vegetate but one cannot really live life begins only with\nthe Sound of one hand Clapping\nthen for the first time you know what it is all about\nbefore it you were just like a robot or a sleepwalker after it your eyes are open your being is open and that opening is the opening of the eternal temple of god it takes you to the innermost shrine of existence and it reveals to you all that is mysterious it makes you capable of releasing your own hidden splendour\nand we are all carrying a world, a beyond within and unless it is released one can never feel at ease something will go on missing sannyas is only a scientific endeavour 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- to release the hidden splendour of your being to bring that which you have contained all along to fulfilment\nto flowering\nit is an invitation for the spring The Sound of One Hand Clapping Chapter #10\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next

contentment</p><p>dhyan means meditation</p><p>they are equivalent, synonymous there exists a subtle synchronicity
between them if you are contented</p><p>there is no need to meditate at all contentment will become your
meditation naturally, spontaneously</p><p>or vice versa -- if you are meditative, silent then contentment will
become a by- product one can begin from either end it is in fact one
phenomenon two ends of the same line</p><p>the easiest is to begin with contentment because there is so much to
be contented with the whole universe provides millions of opportunities
to be contented with those who cannot do it</p><p>they have to start by meditating meditation is an effort</p><p>you have to sit silently, watchfully, relaxedly to calm down your
mind, your whole inner noise but if one starts with contentment it is
far more simple</p><p>looking at the sky full of stars suddenly you feel so contented --
what more can there be?</p><p>it cannot be improved upon the starry night is so breathtaking the
sunset for a moment stops your heartbeat a bird on the wing and suddenly

make an effort, a deliberate effort to be silent but that has always to
be the second thing when the easier course is available don't follow the
arduous; it is unnecessary follow the watercourse way there is no need
to go upstream, go with the river and this very moment you can feel
contentment if i say meditate</p><p>you will have to decide when to start tomorrow, tomorrow morning fix
the alarm and tomorrow morning...</p><p>but if you understand</p><p>what i am saying about contentment then it is there, right now this
very moment</p><p>is so full, so overwhelmingly full that one can easily get lost in it
anutoshi means one who is absolutely contented so i am not leaving
anything for you i am simply declaring</p><p>you can relax into it, nothing has to be done the very idea of
doing</p><p>is an invention of the mind otherwise all is happening but mind is so
cunning</p><p>that even when things are happening it goes on translating them as if
he is doing them</p><p>for example people say i am breathing you see the stupidity?</p><p>nobody is breathing; breathing is happening if people were
breathing</p><p>then it would be impossible for them to die they may continue
breathing death may go on knocking on the door and they may go on doing
the dynamic meditation then what to do?</p><p>they may even start breathing faster we are not breathing</p><p>in fact just the opposite is the case we are being breathed,
existence is breathing us and that is true about everything when you are
hungry you are not hungry it has nothing to do with you, it is simply
there and when you eat and you digest it has nothing to do with you it
is not that you are digesting it just try for twenty- four hours to
digest food 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--4>Osho's

gone now and where it is moving</p><p>and go on touching your belly and find places now it must be here</p><p>and now the bread is being churned into blood you will go crazy
within twenty- four hours everything is happening</p><p>that is one of the fundamentals of my approach to life</p><p>we are not doers</p><p>we are just part of an immense happening so all that is needed on our
part is to relax, rejoice, be in tune that's what i mean by absolute
contentment then each moment brings so much ecstasy and the moment one
feels contentment all problems disappear</p><p>as if they had never existed in the first place uncontainable so
immense</p><p>that one can simply dance in sheer gratitude my sannyasins are not
dancing to attain to god they are not dancing to attain to heavenly
pleasures they are dancing just out of sheer contentment there is
nothing else to do it is not a means to some end in fact it is the
recognition that all is already the case</p><p>and we are here just to celebrate it we are asleep</p><p>our sleep consists of discontentments the only way to wake up is to
drop discontentments and it is very easy to drop them because they are
futile</p><p>even if you carry them</p><p>you will never be able to fulfil them</p><p>]nobody has ever been able to fulfil his discontentments it is an

lives in the present and to live in the present is to be awakened there
is no other secret to it to live now</p><p>to live here is to be awakened the unconscious person lives in dreams
he goes on creating new dreams when old dreams fail</p><p>he immediately substitutes new dreams for them his life is made not
of realities but only of desires the same stuff as dreams are made of he
lives in a cocoon of false notions hallucinations, desires, expectations
and this is simply a way of committing suicide a sannyasin has to come
out of the cocoon he has to drop all nonsense of the mind and be in
contact with reality, with that which is and the reality is really
fulfilling just a single moment of the contact with reality is far more
valuable</p><p>than the whole eternity of dreaming it is so nourishing</p><p>the method to come in contact with reality is consciousness</p><p>because it is unconsciousness that prevents us so the whole work of a
sannyasin is to move from unconscious states to conscious states</p><p>slowly slowly changing every fibre of one's being from
unconsciousness to consciousness and even if you can change a single
moment then you have got the key</p><p>you can change your whole life only the first moment is a little bit

commune so many people trying to be loving trying to be meditative,

themselves they have created</p><p>a certain kind of satisfaction around themselves but satisfaction is
always dull because it is a fabricated thing a manufactured thing</p><p>it has no life, it has no song to it but when contentment explodes
thousands of songs grow in you so that has to be the criterion of
whether you are on the right road or not whether you are moving in the
right direction or not if your song starts becoming deeper if your joy
becomes more and more intense if your life starts taking a tremendous

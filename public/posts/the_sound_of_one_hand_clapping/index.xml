into a beloved of the whole existence as the meditator becomes centred, silent, aware the whole existence starts converging upward the same world but no more the same before it was cold, alien

man lives in a deep anguish for the simple reason
that he has not the courage to merge with the whole he is afraid hence he creates all kinds of defenses barriers, walls
he is afraid of losing his identity and that is the greatest fear in the world and just the opposite is the case with courage courage means readiness to lose one&#39;s identity the moment you lose your identity all anguish, anxiety disappears then the whole takes over</description>

truth cannot be achieved by human efforts because all human efforts are bound to originate in the mind
and mind is the barrier
between truth and consciousness the mind has to be put aside that&#39;s what man is capable of doing not using the mind, putting the mind aside by-passing the mind, transcending the mind and the moment the mind is not functioning consciousness immediately becomes connected with the truth</description>

love and life are synonymous in language they may have different meanings but in existence
they are precisely the same phenomenon no difference, no gap exists between the two the really alive person is pure love and if love is missing then life is nothing but a vegetation one can go on vegetating</description>

mind is a coward, mind is basically fear-oriented it is always suspicious
always doubting, always on guard mind creates a situation in which you feel a stranger to existence
because of all those suspicions that mistrust disconnects one from all that is and then there arises a vicious circle the more you feel lonely, an outsider the more afraid you become because the vast universe seems to be inimical this is mind&#39;s projection</description>

man lives in a state of turmoil for the simple reason
that he is divided into many fragments and all those fragments are fighting to dominate man has not got one self, he has got many selves the idea of one mind is very false man is poly-psychic: he is many minds he is a crowd and of course the crowd cannot be peaceful there is continuous competition each fragment trying to come up on the top there is great politics in everybody&#39;s inner world unless this whole politics ceases there is no possibility of peace at the most people can manage just a facade of peace, just on the surface but deep down they are boiling deep down there is always war sometimes hot, sometimes cold, but no peace in fact the only way to be peaceful is to help all these fragments melt into oneness unless that integration happens one can befool others that one is living in peace 1/08/07</description>

Osho&#39;s books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- love needs great courage for the simple reason that the basic requirement of love is to drop the ego
and man is very afraid of dropping the ego it seems almost like committing suicide it only seems so because we don&#39;t know anything other than the ego ego has become our only identity and to drop it certainly means you are dropping your individuality it is not true</description>

all power is divine
we are only vehicles, passages we are like a hollow bamboo flute our function is to allow god to flow through us the song is divine
the song does not belong to the flute all that the flute can do is not to disturb it not to block it, not to hinder it, but to allow it the function of the flute is in a way negative just not to obstruct</description>

the phenomenon of awareness is paradoxical half of it, the first half, is human effort the other half, the second half, is a divine gift one has to do the utmost one can do to attain it but it is not attained only by that it is not attained without it either the human effort prepares you to receive the gift if you are unprepared and the gift comes you will not even be able to recognise it there is no question of receiving it, welcoming it so the first part is absolutely necessary but one should not get the idea that one attains it through effort the effort only removes the barriers it is negative</description>

awareness is the seed and blissfulness is the flower and the whole pilgrimage
is between these two points awareness and blissfulness we are living in unawareness hence bliss cannot blossom in awareness bliss, in unawareness misery there are the natural by-products everybody wants to be blissful but just by wanting it you cannot attain it you will have to follow the right procedure you will have to follow the law of nature one has to begin with awareness and then bliss comes of its own accord you need not worry about it you need not even desire it, it comes inevitably but the whole work consists of becoming more aware</description>

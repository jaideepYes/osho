8103025 ShortTitle: CLAPP02 Audio:\nNo Video:\nNo\nthe mind is doubt -- every mind, mind as such hence nobody should think that he is without doubt because whatsoever is done through the mind is bound to be doubt-full\neven the so-called beliefs are nothing but cover-ups for doubt one believes so that one can escape from doubt doubt is like a wound\nbut belief is not a healing force it only covers the wound\nit deceives others but that is not very significant it deceives you -- that is of real importance to live in self-deception\nis to miss the whole point of life there are only two ways to deal with doubt you can cover up your doubt with belief millions of people all over the world have been doing that for millions of years doubt remains and goes on growing like a cancerous thing\nthe other way is to go into your doubt rather than hiding, deceiving encounter it, face it, dig it and that is the way to transcend it if one encounters one's doubt one\ncan immediately see\nthat one is separate from one's doubts they are there like objects, you are here the mirror that reflects them the awareness that encounters them this very experience takes you beyond doubt that is the state of faith, of trust and that is the beginning of sannyas desiring includes all desires --\nthe worldly, the other-worldly material, the spiritual the mundane, the sacred\nso it is not a question of choosing either one drops the whole of desiring 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- or one remains in the grip of it the so-called religious people are still in the grip of it they may not desire money\nbut they desire meditation they may not desire power but they desire god\nthey may not desire things of the world but they desire the kingdom of the beyond it is the same desire\nit has come in from the backdoor again you have to be very watchful not to allow desire in any form to enter you because desire is bondage, desire is misery, desire is hell the more full of desires one is the more frustrations one is breeding because each desire will end in frustration whether it succeeds or fails makes no difference frustration is bound to happen, it is inevitable\nif the desire fails\nand out of one hundred desires ninety-nine are bound to fail because it is a competitive world you are not alone\nmany people are desiring the same things there are not enough things and people are many things are scarce and people are millions how many people can be\npresidents how many people can be prime ministers very few... but everybody wants to be hence ninety-nine per cent of desires are bound to fail, and then there will be great frustration one per cent of desires may succeed but frustration comes all the same in fact more so\nbecause when a desire succeeds for the first time you become aware that you have wasted your whole life for it and nothing is attained\nmoney is there\nbut your poverty remains untouched by it your inner emptiness remains the same in fact\nin contrast with the money that you have achieved 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- your inner emptiness looks even emptier than before you have attained power outside but deep inside you know you are impotent impotent in the face of death one has to die, no power can save one so whether a desire succeeds or fails it fails all the same\nthis is one of the most fundamental truths to be understood once you see the point\nthen you don't go on changing horses because they are all the same the black horse and the white horse, devil and god it doesn't make much difference it is just the difference between a black horse and a white horse they will all lead you into misery then one simply gets out of the whole trip one forgets desiring, one starts living desiring is always somewhere else the fulfilment is in the future living\nis now here\nthese are the only two ways to create a style of life living in the future\nwhich is only so-called living because the future is non-existential and living in the present\nwhich is the only way\nof living, authentic living time consists only of two tenses, not of three ordinarily it is divided into three parts the past, the present and the future that is existentially wrong grammatically it may be right linguistically it may be right but i have no concern with language and grammar my concern is with existence as far as existence is concerned time only consists of past and future the present is not part of time it is part of existence\nexistence is always now, it is never then 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- it is never yesterday, never tomorrow it is this very moment and to go beyond time\nis the whole art of meditation meditation is the transcendence of time past and future both\nand the plunging into the now, the here.\nthe deeper you plunge into the now and the here the more you disappear\nbecause mind cannot exist without past and future mind is like a pendulum of a clock it moves from one opposite to the other from right to left, from left to right stop it in the middle and the clock stops mind moves between past and future the clock of the mind\nstop it in the middle and the clock stops and the moment the mind is not there you are not\nthen god is then freedom is then love is\nthen flowering is then eternity is\nthere are many boundaries around us we are the centre of many concentric circles and we have to go beyond\nall those concentric circles only then can we find the centre the most important concentric circles are four the first is the world of objects the majority of people\nis concerned with the world of objects money, power, prestige, respectability they remain very peripheral presidents, prime ministers queens, rotarians, lions\nyou will find all Kinds of stupid people hanging onto the very outermost circumference and making much fuss about it the second concentric circle is of the body many live in the body, particularly women man hangs onto the first more, the most peripheral his concern is more about things, objects far-away objects\nwhat is happening in israel 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- and what is happening in korea the woman is not so concerned about korea and israel\nshe is most concerned about the colour of her hair, her eyelashes the proportion of her body she looks at the male as being a little bit crazy you are unnecessarily worried about the stars and the speed of light what have you to do with it the real thing is the furniture the curtains, the pillows\nthe kitchen, the bathroom\nit looks more mundane to man it looks more earthly\nbut in a way she is closer but many men also remain there they have to because their wives are there their girlfriends are there they cannot go to israel\nthey cannot go to the moon they cannot go to everest\nthey are possessed by their women they won't allow them to\nso they also have to be just very close near the kitchen, the bathroom maybe the woman looks at the mirror and they clean the mirror\nbut they are not very far either millions of people\nsimply live at the physiological, the biological the chemical level of life closer than that is another concentric circle that of the mind: thoughts, ideas philosophers, theologians, thinkers, scientists these people live there\ncloser than that\nis the concentric circle of the heart the poets, the painters\nthe musicians, the dancers the aesthetic people live there but all are outside your real being one has to transcend all these four boundaries only then does one encounter oneself then for the first time\none stands face-to-face to oneself 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- and that is the moment of great illumination when you see your centre you have seen all that is worth seeing you have seen god himself you have seen the truth\nthere is nothing higher than that nothing deeper than that\nnothing more valuable than that sannyas is the transcendence of all boundaries\nso that one day you can simply relax in your very centre that centre is consciousness awareness\ngodliness\nlife is one energy\nbut out of that one energy we can either create love or attachment love is heaven, attachment is hell we can create out of that energy bondage or freedom\nit all depends on us\non how we work upon our energy the lower is cheaper and easier to create hell does not need much intelligence it does not even need courage all that it needs is imitation because millions of people are doing the same thing all around you you can just imitate them\nyour parents, your teachers, your leaders it is simple\nyou will become a carbon copy you will live in the same kind of hell misery, anguish\nand you will give to your children, your heritage and they will repeat the same pattern this way it goes on and on from adam and eve up to you it has been going on in the same way only very few people\nhave been able to get out of the rut and those are the salt of the earth a jesus, a buddha, a lao tzu a zarathustra, a kabir -- very few people they can be counted on one's fingers they are real miracles in existence 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- because to get out of the rut of the crowd is really a great act of courage, intelligence, rebellion the crowd lives in attachment attachment to money\nattachment to children\nattachment to parents\nattachment to wives, husbands attachment to this and that there are thousands of attachments and they think it is love\nbecause they think it is love they cannot get out of it\nso the first thing is to label things correctly to categorise things correctly attachment is love standing upside-down attachment is love gone sour attachment is an ill state of love love is a healthy phenomenon attachment is sick, nauseating and everybody experiences it the more you become attached, the more miserable the more you allow others\nto become attached to you\nthe more miserable they become and of course\nwe become infected with each other's misery and it is never a simple addition it is always multiplication a sannyasin has to learn\nwhat the causes of his misery are and you will find\none of the most significant causes is attachment don't be attached to anything live\nlive totally, live lovingly but don't possess, don't dominate and don't allow anybody\nto possess or dominate you if you want to be really blissful and if you are blissful you can share love love is a sharing of bliss attachment is a sharing of misery it is ugly, it is inhuman\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- love brings freedom to you and also freedom to the person you love let that be the criterion\nif it brings freedom it is love if it brings bondage it is attachment attachment has to be dropped and love has to be grown\nthe more loving you become the closer you are to god jesus is right when he says god is love\nman lives in words\nthe words can be beautiful but they are all empty the word god is not god\nthe word love is not love either you cannot be nourished by the word food and you cannot quench your thirst with the word water\nwords are dangerous\nthey can keep you in deception they can give you the feeling as if you know millions of people think they know god because they know the word millions of people think they know love because they know the word a sannyasin has to get beyond words to the real content\nhe has to disperse words\nand to see what is hidden behind them that's the exploration\njust as one goes on peeling an onion one has to go on peeling words so one can come to the very core of them and the miracle is\nwhen you go on peeling words like an onion ultimately you come to emptiness, nothingness is the ultimate sense of existence that is silence\nwhen all noise of the words has left you and there is only profound silence 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- undisturbed, undistracted in that silence knowing happens seeing happens, being happens bibles, korans,\ngitas cannot give it to you --\nthey are all words, they are beautiful they were spoken by beautiful people but that does not make any difference even if buddha says the word rose it does not become a rose\neven if jesus says the word fire it does not become fire\nbut beautiful people can be so hypnotic that you start believing in their words christians, hindus, mohammedans, buddhists are all doing the same\nthey have all forgotten the reality and are clinging to the labels they are all clinging to the cages maybe they are golden cages but the bird, the alive bird, the singing bird is no more there\nthe search of sannyas\nis for the alive, the singing bird man has two alternatives two possible orientations\none is character, the other is consciousness character is imposed from the outside it is a political and social strategy to dominate the person\nconsciousness is individual, character is social all societies are against consciousness and for character\nbecause they can manipulate character it is within their grasp they can paint it\naccording to their own investment they can cut you into shape to fit with their mechanism they can make you obedient through it they can make you a slave\nand that is the desire 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- of all the establishment but the real master\nnever gives you character\nhe gives you consciousness consciousness is a discovery of your own being no discipline is imposed on you in fact all discipline is disposed of you are allowed to be yourself, authentically as god means you to be\none has to discover one's nature one's spontaneity, one's original face that is consciousness\nthe very discovery\nmakes you more and more conscious the deeper you go into it\nthe more conscious you become a point comes when you are just a flame of light and in that light whatsoever you do is right in that light\nwrong is impossible and right is inevitable then a totally different kind of character comes like a shadow following consciousness i call that character religious, spiritual the so-called character in the world is just political, social\nit has no value at all\nso go beyond the ordinary character so that you can find the real character and the way to find the real is through consciousness\nthe master cannot say anything about truth truth is inexpressible\nit is beyond all indications it cannot even be pointed at because it is not an object\n-- it is all over so when you point at it in a direction you are already falsifying because it is not in one direction it is the whole space\nno gesture is capable of capturing it hence the only way is to go beyond language to go beyond scriptures, to go beyond indications to go beyond all possible symbols, metaphors and just to be in tune with the master just in a silent communion nothing is said, nothing is heard and yet it happens\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- say something and it will be misunderstood try to understand it and you have already misunderstood it neither saying is going to help nor listening is going to help the master is silent, the disciple is silent slowly slowly\nthe two silences merge and become one and when the two silences become one you hear\nthe Sound of one hand Clapping\nthat is beyond alI expression and that is the moment of enlightenment it is a transmission beyond the words beyond indications, beyond scriptures just a flame jumping into another heart a quantum leap from a lit lamp to an unlit lamp the lit lamp loses nothing and the unlit gains everything it is a transmission of light a transmission of the lamp so the disciple has to learn only one thing how to sit in silence, in tremendous love waiting\nwaiting for the moment when it comes not desiring, not expecting not asking, not demanding\njust waiting\nthat is the very soul of sannyas the word waiting truth is beyond discussion it cannot be discussed\neither you see it or you don't see it it cannot be proved\nno argument can support it or destroy it it is not a question of philosophical debate because it is not intellectual at alI hence the most futile exercise in the world is philosophy\nit is just hair-splitting, absolutely pointless the most stupid thing 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- that one can get involved in is philosophy after thousands of years of philosophical analysis not a single conclusion has been reached not a single truth has been arrived at that is enough reason\nfor philosophy being dropped, completely dropped it is an exercise in utter futility this is where sannyas\ntakes a totally different route sannyas basically means mysticism it is not philosophical, it is existential we are not searching to know about truth we are not trying to know about truth we are trying to be the truth and to be the truth is the only way to know it there is no other way\nunless you have tasted it totally so totally that it has become part of your blood, bone and marrow you will not know it\nunless you have become it there is no knowing of it truth cannot be an object\nit becomes your very subjectivity truth is subjectivity, your very innermost core it is self-discovery; hence one has to drop all the patterns of argumentation all the methods of analysis all doubts, all beliefs, all systems of thought theistic, atheistic\ncatholic, protestant, hindu, mohammedan one has to get rid of the whole fabric of the mind the whole junk has to be burned so that one is simply in a state of not-knowing and in that very state of not-knowing the flower of knowing opens up in the east we have called the flower the one-thousand-petalled lotus The Sound of One Hand Clapping Chapter #3\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next

still in the grip of it they may not desire money</p><p>but they desire meditation they may not desire power but they desire
god</p><p>they may not desire things of the world but they desire the kingdom
of the beyond it is the same desire</p><p>it has come in from the backdoor again you have to be very watchful
not to allow desire in any form to enter you because desire is bondage,
desire is misery, desire is hell the more full of desires one is the
more frustrations one is breeding because each desire will end in
frustration whether it succeeds or fails makes no difference frustration
is bound to happen, it is inevitable</p><p>if the desire fails</p><p>and out of one hundred desires ninety-nine are bound to fail because
it is a competitive world you are not alone</p><p>many people are desiring the same things there are not enough things
and people are many things are scarce and people are millions how many
people can be</p><p>presidents how many people can be prime ministers very few... but
everybody wants to be hence ninety-nine per cent of desires are bound to
fail, and then there will be great frustration one per cent of desires
may succeed but frustration comes all the same in fact more so</p><p>because when a desire succeeds for the first time you become aware
that you have wasted your whole life for it and nothing is attained</p><p>money is there</p><p>but your poverty remains untouched by it your inner emptiness remains
the same in fact</p><p>in contrast with the money that you have achieved 1/08/07 Copyright

deep inside you know you are impotent impotent in the face of death one
has to die, no power can save one so whether a desire succeeds or fails
it fails all the same</p><p>this is one of the most fundamental truths to be understood once you
see the point</p><p>then you don't go on changing horses because they are all the same
the black horse and the white horse, devil and god it doesn't make much
difference it is just the difference between a black horse and a white
horse they will all lead you into misery then one simply gets out of the
whole trip one forgets desiring, one starts living desiring is always
somewhere else the fulfilment is in the future living</p><p>is now here</p><p>these are the only two ways to create a style of life living in the
future</p><p>which is only so-called living because the future is non-existential
and living in the present</p><p>which is the only way</p><p>of living, authentic living time consists only of two tenses, not of
three ordinarily it is divided into three parts the past, the present
and the future that is existentially wrong grammatically it may be right
linguistically it may be right but i have no concern with language and

and unpublished Query:- that contentment does not mean satisfaction satisfaction is pseudo contentment deep down there is discontentment satisfaction is only a cover-up, it is a mind trick otherwise life would become impossible if the wound of discontentment is continuously there\none cannot live\nso humanity has created a cover-up for it that is satisfaction\nit is a very thin layer hence scratch a little bit and the discontent starts oozing out like pus contentment is a totally different phenomenon it is the healing of the wound contentment comes\nthrough understanding the nature of desire the nature of desire is unfulfillable there is no way to fulfil it whatsoever you do, the distance between you and your desire will remain the same the desire is just like the horizon it looks just a few miles ahead one feels that one can reach it, it is not so far away but as you move towards it, it goes on moving away the distance remains constantly the same because the horizon in fact does not exist there is no place where the earth and\nthe sky meet it is an optical illusion -- so is desire if you desire something and you feel the moment you attain it there will be joy you can go on hoping till you attain it the moment you attain it you will see there is no joy in it\nthe desire and the hope has moved again farther away\nthe same illusion, the same hope and one goes on living one's whole life running after shadows\nto understand the nature of desire that it is basically unfulfillable is the foundation of contentment the moment you see that the desire is unfulfillable desiring as such disappears and when there is no desire in the heart 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- then one is contented and certainly contentment is the greatest song there cannot be any song superior to contentment of course it is not a song which can be expressed through words it is a song that is only felt it is just like the heartbeat: one feels it it is so deep that it is beyond words, immeasurable but it certainly is a song, it has its own music but totally different from all the music that you have heard before we have a special word for it in the east we call it anahat nad\nthe Sound of one hand Clapping\nyou cannot make a sound by one hand clapping but that's actually what it is because there is no other, only you are there when all the desires have disappeared all others have also disappeared the others were nothing but your objects of desire when the desire is no more the others are no more the moment desire disappears the whole world disappears then there is absolute silence, absolute aloneness but it Is not loneliness -- you are with yourself you are not lonely\nin fact for the first time you enjoy your very being it is silence but not the silence of a cemetery it is very alive, it is full of joy it is the silence of the opening of a flower there is fragrance in it, life in it, colour in it it is a dance, it is a celebration the only glory possible in life is that of absolute contentment to desire is to remain a beggar even though one may be an emperor but because he desires he remains a beggar there is a famous story of a sufi mystic, farid the great moghul emperor, akbar used to come to visit him\nhe lived in a small village near delhi the people of the village once asked farid the emperor comes to see you 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- and we don't even have a small school for our children in the village you can just mention it and we can have the school do us a favour, you can tell the emperor it is impossible that he will not fulfil what you ask for farid said i will do it but because i have to ask then i will have to go to the emperor he went to see the emperor one day in the early morning he was immediately received, welcomed, taken in the emperor was praying, his morning prayer mohammedans pray five times a day he was doing his first prayer, farid stood behind listened to what the emperor was praying when he had finished the prayer the emperor raised his hands towards the sky and asked god, give me more power more wealth, greater kingdom listening to this farid laughed, turned back at his laughter, his turning back, the emperor looked he rushed over, fell at his feet and said why have you come?\nand why you are going back and why did you laugh?\nfarid said, i used to think that you are an emperor but you are not, you are still a beggar and i am going back because i had come to ask for a school for my village children but to ask from a beggar does not look right so cannot ask\nbecause to make a school in the village you will become a little bit poorer you are already poor\nand moreover if i have to ask then why should i ask you\ni can ask god himself\nwhy have a mediator between?\ndesire makes everybody a beggar hence there can be no glory when one is full of desires the moment desires are dropped and the contentment settles in the innermost core of your being there is immense glory\nit is the release of the hidden splendour the experience of contentment is the only real spiritual experience 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- a contented heart is the right climate for meditation to grow hence meditation cannot be a desire you cannot desire it\nwhen all the desires are dropped only then meditation can start growing in you meditation is not a means to any end it is the end itself, the end unto itself hence the people who try to meditate for some purpose\nare missing the whole point of it meditation is non-purposive even to desire god will hinder your meditation hence the religions\nthat have really developed meditation have dropped the idea of god jainism and buddhism, two religions which have developed the art of meditation to its ultimate peak\nboth have dropped the idea of god not that god does not exist but they have dropped the idea for the simple reason that if god is talked about then naturally one will desire to attain to god's experience buddha dropped all ideas\nabout heaven, paradise, moksha for the simple reason that if these ideas are there then you are giving objects for people's desire and meditation cannot grow in the climate of desiring its basic requirement is\nthat there should be no desire in you the moment there is no desire mind can be\neasily put aside because mind is a mechanism to fulfil your desires\nwhen you don!t want to go anywhere you can put your car aside, there is no point you can give it to a friend, you can dispose of it its whole function is if you want to go somewhere mind's function is to help you fulfil your desires mind is a mechanism, a device so that you can attain\nwhatsoever you dream, desire, expect, hope 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- and meditation is a state of no-mind you can put the mind aside only when there is nothing to be desired when you don't want to go anywhere when you are utterly happy, now, here this very moment\nthen meditation grows spontaneously, effortlessly then your silence goes on deepening and as your silence deepens you become more and more existential less and less an individual, separate from existence more and more universal, one with the existence and that oneness is really what religions have called god it is a name for an experience god is not a person\nbut the ultimate experience of oneness with the whole knowledge is not wisdom\nknowledge is acquired\nso that you can fulfil your desires lord acton is right when he says knowledge is power\ncertainly knowledge gives you power power to attain your ambitions power to achieve your desires power to be somebody important but knowledge is all borrowed from the schools to the universities what goes on happening in the name of education is nothing but stuffing people's minds with borrowed knowledge\nthe whole educational system exists as an agent of the past\nin the service of the vested interests so that you can become useful so that you can be productive so that you can be reduced into a commodity society uses knowledge to be powerful over you you use knowledge to be powerful over others wisdom is a totally different dimension it has nothing to do with power it has nothing to do with achieving any ambition wisdom happens only when one has dropped the whole stupidity of ambitiousness it is stupidity\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- because even if you become alexander the great so what? -- he died in utter frustration he conquered almost the whole world at least the world that was known in his days and he was only thirty-three when he died he did a tremendous job of conquering the world he spent his whole energy, his whole life in conquering the world\nand at the age of thirty-three he died the day he died he wanted to live one day more just one day more to see his mother because that was the distance he had to travel twenty-four hours were needed for him to reach back to his capital he was going back from india and he had promised his mother that when he had conquered the world he would come and offer the whole world to her only twenty-four hours he wanted he asked his physicians\nthey said we cannot do anything you cannot live more than a few minutes he said i am ready to give everything you can take half of my kingdom they said even if you give your whole kingdom we cannot save you -- it is impossible at that moment\nhe understood the futility of his whole effort with his whole kingdom\nhe could not even buy twenty-four hours he had wasted thirty-three years for conquering something\nwhich was not even capable of purchasing twenty-four hours thirty-three years wasted, his life spent in attaining something\nwhich is absolutely meaningless he died in utter frustration all ambitious people\ndie in frustration they live in frustration, they die in frustration contentment is simply the understanding that the ambitious attitude towards life is unintelligent\nand the moment you see the unintelligence of it desires simply evaporate from your life then you don't want to be somebody 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- then you are perfectly happy in being nobody and in that state wisdom blossoms wisdom does not come from the outside it is the explosion of your inner consciousness it is not knowledge, it is an insight into the innermost mysteries of existence and that insight makes you immensely ecstatic because that insight gives you an authentic glimpse of your own immortality you have been here before birth and you will be here after death birth and death are small episodes in the eternity of life\nand to know life eternal\nis to know god, another name for god it is possible to be contented right now it need not wait for tomorrow desire has to wait for tomorrow because it will take time to arrange, manage, reach desire needs future\nwithout future desire has no way to exist in fact it is desire that creates future otherwise there is no future time consists only of now -- the past is no more the future is not yet -- they are both non-existential only the now is existential then what is past?\npast is only memory and what is future~ future is only desire\nthey are dimensions of your mind not dimensions of time\npast is the dust that the mind has gathered and future is the hopes, the desires, the ambitions that the mind wants to reach some goals contentment is possible\nin fact, is only possible right now you cannot postpone it\nif you postpone it you have turned it into a desire if somebody says i would like to be contented he is talking nonsense\nbecause he is talking in terms of desire, and desire is just the polar opposite of contentment one has simply to see that desire takes you 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- into the non-existential future contentment is to live this moment in its totality, passionately without diverting your mind anywhere else from the moment if one can live each moment with totality, intensity then contentment follows you like a shadow it is always with you\nand to be contented is the whole of religion one need not be a christian nor a hindu or a mohammedan one needs only to be contented to be religious only a contented heart can love that's why you see in the world everybody wants to love and to be loved but it does not happen, it cannot happen because the basic requirement is missing without a background of deep contentment one is not capable of sharing love love is the fragrance of the flower of contentment and if the flower is not there, you can pretend at the most you can deceive others and yourself but it is not going to fulfil pretensions can't help, one remains frustrated everybody is trying to give love but in fact what people give to each other is only misery, not love\nlovers become imprisonments to each other they don't become freedom\nand love makes the other absolutely free but because love is not there the pseudo love simply tries to possess the other and the moment you possess the other you are insulting the other because you are trying\nto make a property of the other this is the greatest insult hence lovers continuously quarrel for the simple reason\nthat both are trying to possess each other both are desiring the other both are trying to use the other as a means for their own ends this is not love\nthis is something very unloving it may be even hatred masquerading as love 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- it is violence -- but the label is beautiful but labels are labels when you taste the content then it is poison so the honeymoon is over\nthe moment you have gone beyond the label when you have opened the container the honeymoon is over and the misery begins all so-called love creates suffering in the world for the simple reason\nthat we have not prepared the ground for it in my observation\nonly a contented heart can share love because he has so much joy to share he is not a beggar so he is not asking give me love\nhe simply gives because he has so much he is like a raincloud\nso full of rainwater he has to shower he does not make the other feel obliged to him either in fact he feels obliged\nthat the other accepted his gift he could have rejected\nwhen love comes out of your abundance not out of an empty heart\nwhich wants somehow to stuff itself with something when it comes as an overflowing joy then only it gives freedom then only it creates a paradise around itself wherever a man of contentment is, there is paradise it has been said in the past that the contented people enter paradise i say that is not right\nthe contented people don't enter paradise the contented people, wherever they are create paradise\nyou can throw them in hell and they will create paradise there one cannot desire truth, god, liberation, nirvana if you desire you have not understood at all desire is the barrier not the bridge desire is the wall that prevents you from the ultimate\nunion with existence the moment you drop desiring immediately, instantly a melting, a merging starts happening 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- it is desire that creates a boundary around you it makes a fence around you and keeps you separate\nit makes you like an island and to be separated from existence is the only misery, the only anguish because we are waves in the ocean of the infinite we are not separate\nthe very idea of being separate is false but we can live in that false idea and to live in the false is to suffer to live in the real is to celebrate we have to disappear into the ocean like a dewdrop slipping from the lotus leaf only a contented heart is capable of disappearing into the ocean of the whole but one does not lose anything, one gains of course one disappears as a dewdrop but one becomes the ocean\nit is not a loss, it is immense gain of course before you have entered the ocean there is fear that you will be losing your identity even the dewdrops must be trembling, afraid trying to cling to the lotus leaf and that is the fear of all human beings we are clinging to our egos e are clinging to our boundaries we are clinging even to our chains because we think they are our identity our name, our form, they are all invented things we come in the world without any name and no form is ours\njust watch the whole process of a child growing in the mother's womb from the first moment\nto the time when the body is taken to the grave how many forms come and go no form is yours, millions of forms the moment your mother became pregnant if that small, atomic cell is shown to you or a picture of it is shown to you you will not believe that this is me but this was your form one day in fact it will be so small you will not be able to see it with your bare eyes you will need a microscope you will need something to magnify it only then will you be able to see it 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- and you will not recognise your face there will be no face, no hands, no legs nothing at all -- this is you? you cannot believe a woman was showing her small child the album of their family\nand they came across a picture of a beautiful young man\nwith long hair, black hair and the child was interested and he asked who is this, mum?\nand the mother said this is your papa and the child said this is my papa? then who is this guy who lives with us?\ni was always thinking that he is our papa forms go on changing continuously you don't have any form\nyou don't bring any name with you to understand it, to see it, to realise it helps immensely\nthen it is not very difficult to allow oneself the quantum leap from the individual to the whole to me, to become one with the whole is the only holiness there is contentment is a beautiful flower of immense beauty, of great fragrance being with a contented man you can immediately feel\na cool breeze, a fresh breeze if you have eyes you can even see if you have ears you can hear the Sound\nof one hand Clapping\njesus says again and again to his disciples if you have eyes, see; if you have ears, hear he is not talking to blind people or deaf people he is talking to people just like you who have eyes but their eyes are so clouded they cannot see their noses are so blocked they cannot smell their ears at the most can hear but cannot listen 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- a psychotherapist was talking to a child whose mother had brought the child to the psychotherapist and the mother talked and talked for one hour the child was sitting there as if utterly deaf finally the psychotherapist asked the child do you have any trouble with hearing?\nthe child said no, i have no trouble with hearing but i have trouble with listening and the child\nis making an immensely beautiful distinction between hearing and listening and the psychotherapist could understand the mother is talking too much anybody would have difficulty in listening hearing is okay, hearing is a physiological thing just your eardrums have to be right and you will hear but listening means\nnot only your ears are functioning but your ears are also joined with your attention you are paying attention\nyou are fully aware of what is happening when awareness joins with your ears then listening happens\nwhen awareness joins with your eyes then seeing happens when awareness joins with your hands then touching happens\notherwise one can touch mechanically contentment is something invisible the person who has it experiences it but a few others who are sensitive they can also feel it\nthe very presence of it is almost tangible to the alert, to the attentive that's how for thousands of years disciples have been finding the masters there is no other way, no other criterion it is not a question of logic not a question of intellect it is a question of feeling when the disciple feels the contentment when the disciple can smell the fragrance of contentment then he knows that he has come home that this is the place where he belongs that this is the man to be with that this is the light\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- i have been seeking and searching no visible criterion is possible it is certainly invisible, a transmission beyond words but if awareness is there\nthen it is not something you have to imagine it is very tangible, you can touch it you can hold it in your hand your heart starts beating with a new rhythm in the east we have called it one-thousand-petalled lotus -- sahasrar when one becomes really contented then in the lake of one's consciousness a one-thousand-petalled lotus opens up that is the ultimate peak of life to die without knowing it is to have lived in vain and it is, remember, everybody's birthright just one has to claim it\nit is there as a potential, it can be actualised only a commitment, an involvement, a decisiveness to make it a realisation is needed that's what sannyas is all about a commitment that i am going to work in every possible way i am going to put my whole energy into transforming my being into a beautiful flower and the very decisiveness\nand the flower starts opening the moment your heart is totally involved with it a miracle happens\nsomething suddenly starts moving within your being a new energy which has remained dormant for long becomes dynamic\nwhen one is contented within one becomes detached\nfrom a thousand and one things one remains in life, one does not escape from life but one lives in a totally new way in the world and yet not of the world that is detachment\none is in the world but the world is not within oneself that is detachment\ni am against all escapist attitudes i don't support the idea of people escaping to the mountains, to the deserts, to the caves to the monasteries\nno, not at all\nit is because of this escapist attitude in the past 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- that humanity has suffered much religion should be a way of life not a way of renouncing life it should be the art of living life it should not be cowardly\nin fact all the religions in the past have been teaching cowardliness all their monks and nuns were nothing but hippies i mean literally\nthey had shown their hips to the world they were real hippies, they escaped from the world my sannyasins have to live in the world but live in a totally new way to live in the world\nas a lotus flower lives in the lake the lotus flower is the symbol of sannyas the lotus flower has a tremendous quality about it it lives in the water but untouched by the water it is so velvety that the water cannot touch it even in the early morning\nwhen dewdrops gather on its leaves and on its petals it remains dry, it does not become wet those dewdrops are there but they are not touching the lotus leaf or the lotus petals that's how a sannyasin should live utterly contented, utterly silent in the world and yet not of the world The Sound of One Hand Clapping Chapter #18\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next

contentment deep down there is discontentment satisfaction is only a
cover-up, it is a mind trick otherwise life would become impossible if
the wound of discontentment is continuously there</p><p>one cannot live</p><p>so humanity has created a cover-up for it that is satisfaction</p><p>it is a very thin layer hence scratch a little bit and the discontent
starts oozing out like pus contentment is a totally different phenomenon
it is the healing of the wound contentment comes</p><p>through understanding the nature of desire the nature of desire is
unfulfillable there is no way to fulfil it whatsoever you do, the
distance between you and your desire will remain the same the desire is
just like the horizon it looks just a few miles ahead one feels that one
can reach it, it is not so far away but as you move towards it, it goes
on moving away the distance remains constantly the same because the
horizon in fact does not exist there is no place where the earth and</p><p>the sky meet it is an optical illusion -- so is desire if you desire
something and you feel the moment you attain it there will be joy you
can go on hoping till you attain it the moment you attain it you will
see there is no joy in it</p><p>the desire and the hope has moved again farther away</p><p>the same illusion, the same hope and one goes on living one's whole
life running after shadows</p><p>to understand the nature of desire that it is basically unfulfillable
is the foundation of contentment the moment you see that the desire is
unfulfillable desiring as such disappears and when there is no desire in

song superior to contentment of course it is not a song which can be
expressed through words it is a song that is only felt it is just like
the heartbeat: one feels it it is so deep that it is beyond words,
immeasurable but it certainly is a song, it has its own music but
totally different from all the music that you have heard before we have
a special word for it in the east we call it anahat nad</p><p>the Sound of one hand Clapping</p><p>you cannot make a sound by one hand clapping but that's actually what
it is because there is no other, only you are there when all the desires
have disappeared all others have also disappeared the others were
nothing but your objects of desire when the desire is no more the others
are no more the moment desire disappears the whole world disappears then
there is absolute silence, absolute aloneness but it Is not loneliness
-- you are with yourself you are not lonely</p><p>in fact for the first time you enjoy your very being it is silence
but not the silence of a cemetery it is very alive, it is full of joy it
is the silence of the opening of a flower there is fragrance in it, life
in it, colour in it it is a dance, it is a celebration the only glory
possible in life is that of absolute contentment to desire is to remain
a beggar even though one may be an emperor but because he desires he
remains a beggar there is a famous story of a sufi mystic, farid the
great moghul emperor, akbar used to come to visit him</p><p>he lived in a small village near delhi the people of the village once

it and we can have the school do us a favour, you can tell the emperor

will do it but because i have to ask then i will have to go to the
emperor he went to see the emperor one day in the early morning he was
immediately received, welcomed, taken in the emperor was praying, his
morning prayer mohammedans pray five times a day he was doing his first
prayer, farid stood behind listened to what the emperor was praying when
he had finished the prayer the emperor raised his hands towards the sky
and asked god, give me more power more wealth, greater kingdom listening
to this farid laughed, turned back at his laughter, his turning back,
the emperor looked he rushed over, fell at his feet and said why have
you come?</p><p>and why you are going back and why did you laugh?</p><p>farid said, i used to think that you are an emperor but you are not,
you are still a beggar and i am going back because i had come to ask for
a school for my village children but to ask from a beggar does not look
right so cannot ask</p><p>because to make a school in the village you will become a little bit
poorer you are already poor</p><p>and moreover if i have to ask then why should i ask you</p><p>i can ask god himself</p><p>why have a mediator between?</p><p>desire makes everybody a beggar hence there can be no glory when one

some purpose</p><p>are missing the whole point of it meditation is non-purposive even to
desire god will hinder your meditation hence the religions</p><p>that have really developed meditation have dropped the idea of god
jainism and buddhism, two religions which have developed the art of
meditation to its ultimate peak</p><p>both have dropped the idea of god not that god does not exist but
they have dropped the idea for the simple reason that if god is talked
about then naturally one will desire to attain to god's experience
buddha dropped all ideas</p><p>about heaven, paradise, moksha for the simple reason that if these
ideas are there then you are giving objects for people's desire and
meditation cannot grow in the climate of desiring its basic requirement
is</p><p>that there should be no desire in you the moment there is no desire
mind can be</p><p>easily put aside because mind is a mechanism to fulfil your
desires</p><p>when you don!t want to go anywhere you can put your car aside, there

tasted hence the only thing\nthat is preventing people from being blissful is a courageous heart\npeople are being very cowardly they are being taught to be cowardly their whole pattern of life is underlined with a current of fear this is our politics, religion, culture, society it depends on fear and exploitation of fear hence the moment somebody decides to be blissful nobody can prevent him\nno force, no power can prevent him 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- just a little courage courage to risk, courage to be alone courage to go against the crowd, the mob courage not to follow and imitate the fools they are all miserable\nand they would like you also to be just like them and they will create every kind of hindrance if you start being different the crowd never likes anybody who is\ndifferent from it\nhe looks like a foreigner, he is suspicious, suspected he cannot be trusted -- he is not one of us that is the logic of the crowd so those who want to be with the crowd can never be blissful\nthen their destiny is closed they will live in misery and die in misery it is our decision, it is our life it is nobody else's business and one should not lose one's life just for the sheer sake of conformity convention, respectability once you are ready to drop all that nonsense the dawn has come\nsuddenly the light bursts forth and life becomes a beautiful dance there is only one religion and that is the religion of bliss the moment you are blissful you are religious if you are not blissful you are irreligious that is my definition\nsimple but of immense implications you need not be a christian or a hindu or a mohammedan to be religious the whole earth is full of these people and there is no religious quality anywhere all these religions have been quarrelling fighting, killing each other in the name of god\nin the name of love in the name of peace\nthis is such a ridiculous situation that it seems unbelievable that for thousands of years we have lived with this situation and we have not yet been able to change it it is so illogical, irrational, so absurd 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- my message is very simple just be blissful\nand don't bother about dogmas, creeds whether there is a god or not whether there is an after-life or not these are all irrelevant questions what matters is: right now are you blissful or not?\nif you are blissful then everything that is true is going to happen to you\nthere is no need to search for it it will come of its own accord if you are miserable\nyou can go on gathering knowledge esoteric, occult and all kinds of bullshit but it is of no use\nyou remain miserable all the same you talk about chakras and kundalini and the rising energy and the planes and all the kinds of rubbish people go on talking about these are just diversions\nsomehow they are trying to distract themselves from their misery\ni am against all occultism all so-called hidden esoteric secrets i teach the open secret be blissful that is the only true religion and the person who is blissful cannot harm anybody the blissful person is a benediction to the whole existence\nbliss is our very nature, it is our eternal law in fact we cannot lose it\nat the most we can only forget about it so the only question is to remember nothing has to be achieved but only remembered\n... a forgotten language\neach child is born in deep bliss and then we start teaching him the language of misery\nand we burden him with so many things that slowly slowly his natural, spontaneous being is covered with thousands of layers he forgets all about it\nhe forgets about himself 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- the function of the master is to remind you that you may have forgotten it, but it is still there just a little digging is needed just as there are vicious circles there\nare blissful circles too in a vicious circle one wrong leads to another wrong in a blissful circle one bliss leads to another bliss it is only a question of choosing the right circle for your life people are living in vicious circles for example, if somebody finds it difficult to fall asleep\nhe tries hard to go into sleep he tosses, turns, repeats mantras counts sheep, from one to hundred and then backwards\nbut whatsoever he is doing will create more sleeplessness because sleep is not something that you can bring about by effort\nnow he is getting into a vicious circle the more he endeavours to bring about sleep the more he will feel himself awake the more he feels himself awake the more he will try new methods transcendental meditation, etcetera to fall asleep\nand this can go on ad nauseum in the morning he will be far more tired than if he had simply accepted the fact that sleep is not there\nso it is not there and rested there was every possibility he may have fallen asleep because he would not have created the vicious circle\nthe same is true about bliss, about everything just a small beginning\nand then it triggers bigger phenomena my own observation is that if you can be blissful about a single thing in your life that's enough\nand it will lead you into new dimensions, new peaks 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- so whatsoever you love, whatsoever you like do it, enjoy it, enjoy it totally don't think about whether it is something great or not\nit doesn't matter\nwhat really matters is your enjoyment if you can enjoy anything totally you are creating a circle of bliss it will lead to new points, new departures higher peaks\nand soon you will be surprised that a small beginning\nhas brought you to the ultimate hence start with the immediate, whatsoever it is just sipping a cup of tea is enough if you can enjoy it totally it will lead you to the ultimate samadhi there are not small things and big things in life only intelligent people and unintelligent people the intelligent person\ntransforms everything into bliss and the unintelligent\ntransforms everything into misery blissfulness has never been thought of as a virtue although it is the fundamental virtue they have been talking about character truthfulness, sincerity\nhumbleness, compassion service, non-violence\nand a thousand and one things as virtues but a very strange fact is they all drop one thing consistently blissfulness\nno religion counts it as a virtue because these so-called religions cannot allow people to be blissful they want you to be miserable and all their virtues\ncreate more misery in you than before it is very obvious\nyou can find ordinary people more joyous than your so-called religious people you will find sinners more innocent than your saints for the simple reason that the saint has been cultivating virtues he has cultivated a thick facade around himself like an iron wall, he lives behind it he is imprisoned in his own ideas 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- he is a prisoner of his own stupidity i don't teach any other virtue because to me the fundamental virtue is bliss everything else is just an aspect of it if one is blissful\ni cannot conceive that he can be untruthful that is impossible\nit is not in the very nature of things if one is blissful he cannot harm he cannot hurt if one is blissful he is bound to be compassionate inevitably\nso to me all the virtues\nare by-products of blissfulness and blissfulness is the only virtue which is not a by-product of anything else there are two kinds of discipline one that is imposed from the outside i am against it, it creates slaves and we have enough of slaves in the world we need a few free spirits to bring a little new breeze into existence\nto bring a few new insights new splendours, new dimensions i teach the second kind of discipline which arises out of your own understanding the first discipline has a set structure the second discipline is liquid it changes moment-to-moment because life changes\nhow can you have ready-made answers to situations which are constantly changing?\nat this moment one thing may be true the next moment it may not be true at all in one situation it may be right in another situation the same thing may be wrong hence i say, be alert, be aware be blissful and act out of your blissfulness awareness, alertness, meditativeness rather than acting out of fixed principles act out of spontaneity, naturally respond to the situation\nand then whatsoever you do is right and of course it is right not because it is written in some scripture 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- it is right because it fits to the situation it is right because it is the adequate response and every adequate response gives tremendous contentment whenever you can act in a totally alive way you will feel immense fulfilment following it and that is bliss\npleasure is momentary\nhappiness is a little more than momentary but not much\nthe difference is only of degrees it lasts a little longer than pleasure but sooner or later it ends bliss is eternal; it begins but it never ends to know bliss is to know\nthe ultimate fabric of existence and that is our longest desire that is our search -- knowingly, unknowingly everybody is searching for it unless we have found the eternal we will be homeless\nonly the eternal can suffice less than that won't do\nso pleasures one can have but soon one becomes fed up, tired, bored they become repetitive\nhappiness one can have\nbut how long can one go on playing with toys?\nbeautiful, but toys are toys one needs something more substantial more nourishing -- and that's what bliss is and the miracle is that it is already within you you have not to go anywhere to find it in fact just the opposite has to be done you have to pull yourself from everywhere so for few moments at least you can be within yourself that's what i call meditation withdrawing yourself from the whole world for a few moments, just to rest and relax in the very pool of your consciousness once you have started tasting the joy of that rest you are coming closer to home, to the eternal life can either be a tale told by an idiot 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- or it can be a tale told by a buddha it all depends on you if you remain asleep, unconscious your life will be just accidental like driftwood at the mercy of the winds and the waves meaningless\ndrifting towards death, becoming every day more and more gloomy and dark but if you become a little alert and awakened the quality of life immediately changes then it is no more accidental it starts having a subtle meaning to it that meaning is bliss and then life starts turning into a beautiful story a parable of immense\ndimensions then a single man's life contains all the scriptures of the world then one can read the whole story of existence within one's own heartbeat but for that, one condition has to be fulfilled one has to become a little more awake a little more conscious\nblissfulness grows\nin the same proportion as consciousness it is always symmetrical to consciousness if one is miserable that shows he is unconscious if one is blissful that shows he is conscious if one is absolutely blissful that shows one has arrived the only thing that can be called divine is blissfulness\nthe only thing that proves the existence of godliness is blissfulness no other argument can prove it there have been many arguments for the existence of the divine but they can all be refuted, they have been refuted man has not been able to find a single argument which is irrefutable but there have been a few people in the world the very salt of the earth whose existence cannot be refuted whose presence cannot be refuted, whose presence leaves such an impact of blissfulness that even if you want to deny it you cannot deny it\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- in spite of yourself you have to accept and that something more is what we are trying to impart here that something more, that quality, xyz i call it blissfulness -- it can only be imparted hence the beauty of the love affair between a master and a disciple it is simply a love affair it is the coming together of two hearts in deep trust, in communion so close, so open and vulnerable that the flame from one heart\ncan jump into the other heart and suddenly the unlit lamp is lit and the miracle has happened it happens suddenly\nit is not a gradual process at all pleasure needs two persons happiness also needs duality bliss does not need two persons or duality one is enough alone\nit happens in one's deepest aloneness hence it is called the Sound\nof one hand Clapping\nin pleasure you will need a partner if you enjoy food you will need food if you enjoy music then music is needed you have to depend on something and any dependence hurts\nand any dependence becomes a bondage and one cannot forgive the person to whom one becomes dependent that's why lovers quarrel\nthe basic cause of quarrel is that they feel they are encaged by each other that they cannot be happy without each other that hurts, that hurts very much that i have become dependent, addicted it is like drug addiction\none feels the slavery\nand how can one be blissful in slavery we have to search and seek within ourselves a space where bliss happens but independently it needs nothing else for it to happen 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- it happens as our own innermost source that's why bliss brings with it freedom, truth, and a sense of immense grandeur, splendour one never gets fed up with bliss and the blissful person becomes capable of living with other people also blissfully because now he is no longer dependent on anything he can enjoy pleasures, he can enjoy happinesses because he knows that he has reached to a state which is always available to him where he can always go\nleaving the whole world behind he has entered\ninto that inner circle of his being where nobody can interfere where no bondage exists\nwhere there is only pure music and poetry and dance and celebration anahato is one of the most beautiful names it is very significant\nonly those who have known that state are the buddhas so try to hear\nthe Sound of one hand Clapping\nit is there; one just has to become a little silent and it is heard\nonce heard, it is

counts sheep, from one to hundred and then backwards</p><p>but whatsoever he is doing will create more sleeplessness because
sleep is not something that you can bring about by effort</p><p>now he is getting into a vicious circle the more he endeavours to
bring about sleep the more he will feel himself awake the more he feels
himself awake the more he will try new methods transcendental
meditation, etcetera to fall asleep</p><p>and this can go on ad nauseum in the morning he will be far more
tired than if he had simply accepted the fact that sleep is not
there</p><p>so it is not there and rested there was every possibility he may have
fallen asleep because he would not have created the vicious circle</p><p>the same is true about bliss, about everything just a small
beginning</p><p>and then it triggers bigger phenomena my own observation is that if
you can be blissful about a single thing in your life that's enough</p><p>and it will lead you into new dimensions, new peaks 1/08/07 Copyright

totally don't think about whether it is something great or not</p><p>it doesn't matter</p><p>what really matters is your enjoyment if you can enjoy anything
totally you are creating a circle of bliss it will lead to new points,
new departures higher peaks</p><p>and soon you will be surprised that a small beginning</p><p>has brought you to the ultimate hence start with the immediate,
whatsoever it is just sipping a cup of tea is enough if you can enjoy it
totally it will lead you to the ultimate samadhi there are not small
things and big things in life only intelligent people and unintelligent
people the intelligent person</p><p>transforms everything into bliss and the unintelligent</p><p>transforms everything into misery blissfulness has never been thought
of as a virtue although it is the fundamental virtue they have been
talking about character truthfulness, sincerity</p><p>humbleness, compassion service, non-violence</p><p>and a thousand and one things as virtues but a very strange fact is
they all drop one thing consistently blissfulness</p><p>no religion counts it as a virtue because these so-called religions
cannot allow people to be blissful they want you to be miserable and all
their virtues</p><p>create more misery in you than before it is very obvious</p><p>you can find ordinary people more joyous than your so-called
religious people you will find sinners more innocent than your saints
for the simple reason that the saint has been cultivating virtues he has
cultivated a thick facade around himself like an iron wall, he lives
behind it he is imprisoned in his own ideas 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--2>Osho's

because to me the fundamental virtue is bliss everything else is just an
aspect of it if one is blissful</p><p>i cannot conceive that he can be untruthful that is impossible</p><p>it is not in the very nature of things if one is blissful he cannot
harm he cannot hurt if one is blissful he is bound to be compassionate
inevitably</p><p>so to me all the virtues</p><p>are by-products of blissfulness and blissfulness is the only virtue
which is not a by-product of anything else there are two kinds of
discipline one that is imposed from the outside i am against it, it
creates slaves and we have enough of slaves in the world we need a few
free spirits to bring a little new breeze into existence</p><p>to bring a few new insights new splendours, new dimensions i teach
the second kind of discipline which arises out of your own understanding
the first discipline has a set structure the second discipline is liquid
it changes moment-to-moment because life changes</p><p>how can you have ready-made answers to situations which are
constantly changing?</p><p>at this moment one thing may be true the next moment it may not be
true at all in one situation it may be right in another situation the
same thing may be wrong hence i say, be alert, be aware be blissful and
act out of your blissfulness awareness, alertness, meditativeness rather
than acting out of fixed principles act out of spontaneity, naturally
respond to the situation</p><p>and then whatsoever you do is right and of course it is right not
because it is written in some scripture 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--3>Osho's

is the adequate response and every adequate response gives tremendous
contentment whenever you can act in a totally alive way you will feel
immense fulfilment following it and that is bliss</p><p>pleasure is momentary</p><p>happiness is a little more than momentary but not much</p><p>the difference is only of degrees it lasts a little longer than
pleasure but sooner or later it ends bliss is eternal; it begins but it
never ends to know bliss is to know</p><p>the ultimate fabric of existence and that is our longest desire that
is our search -- knowingly, unknowingly everybody is searching for it
unless we have found the eternal we will be homeless</p><p>only the eternal can suffice less than that won't do</p><p>so pleasures one can have but soon one becomes fed up, tired, bored
they become repetitive</p><p>happiness one can have</p><p>but how long can one go on playing with toys?</p><p>beautiful, but toys are toys one needs something more substantial
more nourishing -- and that's what bliss is and the miracle is that it
is already within you you have not to go anywhere to find it in fact
just the opposite has to be done you have to pull yourself from
everywhere so for few moments at least you can be within yourself that's
what i call meditation withdrawing yourself from the whole world for a
few moments, just to rest and relax in the very pool of your
consciousness once you have started tasting the joy of that rest you are
coming closer to home, to the eternal life can either be a tale told by
an idiot 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--or-it-can-be-a-tale-told-by-a-buddha-it-all-depends-on-you>Osho's

like driftwood at the mercy of the winds and the waves meaningless</p><p>drifting towards death, becoming every day more and more gloomy and
dark but if you become a little alert and awakened the quality of life
immediately changes then it is no more accidental it starts having a
subtle meaning to it that meaning is bliss and then life starts turning
into a beautiful story a parable of immense</p><p>dimensions then a single man's life contains all the scriptures of
the world then one can read the whole story of existence within one's
own heartbeat but for that, one condition has to be fulfilled one has to
become a little more awake a little more conscious</p><p>blissfulness grows</p><p>in the same proportion as consciousness it is always symmetrical to
consciousness if one is miserable that shows he is unconscious if one is
blissful that shows he is conscious if one is absolutely blissful that
shows one has arrived the only thing that can be called divine is
blissfulness</p><p>the only thing that proves the existence of godliness is blissfulness
no other argument can prove it there have been many arguments for the
existence of the divine but they can all be refuted, they have been
refuted man has not been able to find a single argument which is
irrefutable but there have been a few people in the world the very salt
of the earth whose existence cannot be refuted whose presence cannot be
refuted, whose presence leaves such an impact of blissfulness that even
if you want to deny it you cannot deny it</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:justify id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--in-spite-of-yourself-you-have-to-accept-and-that-something-more>Osho's

beauty of the love affair between a master and a disciple it is simply a
love affair it is the coming together of two hearts in deep trust, in
communion so close, so open and vulnerable that the flame from one
heart</p><p>can jump into the other heart and suddenly the unlit lamp is lit and
the miracle has happened it happens suddenly</p><p>it is not a gradual process at all pleasure needs two persons
happiness also needs duality bliss does not need two persons or duality
one is enough alone</p><p>it happens in one's deepest aloneness hence it is called the

it freedom, truth, and a sense of immense grandeur, splendour one never
gets fed up with bliss and the blissful person becomes capable of living
with other people also blissfully because now he is no longer dependent
on anything he can enjoy pleasures, he can enjoy happinesses because he
knows that he has reached to a state which is always available to him
where he can always go</p><p>leaving the whole world behind he has entered</p><p>into that inner circle of his being where nobody can interfere where
no bondage exists</p><p>where there is only pure music and poetry and dance and celebration

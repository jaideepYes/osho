flute all that the flute can do is not to disturb it not to block it, not to hinder it, but to allow it the function of the flute is in a way negative just not to obstruct\nand then the song goes on flowing that's where our ego creates trouble the ego is a block\nit fills the hollow bamboo flute and stops the song from flowing through it then life becomes obviously a misery, an anguish it misses the song -- that song is our very life god is our very life\ngod is not some person somewhere but our very heartbeat, our very existence and the ego is our enemy but very cunning it pretends to be our friend, our greatest friend sannyas simply means\nseeing the destructiveness of the ego and dropping it... in a single blow, not gradually it cannot be dropped gradually either one sees the point and drops it or one goes on carrying it hoping some day to drop it but that very hope is illusory 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- when your house is on fire you don't wait for tomorrow you rush out of it\nyou don't even think to get out in a proper way from the main gate, from the main door you even jump out of a window and if you are taking a bath naked you jump naked out of the window you don't even wait to wrap around a towel when the house is on fire\none cannot postpone even for a single moment and the house is on fire\neverybody is suffering, everybody is burning in hell everybody is living in such misery, anguish there is no joy, no song, no dance for the simple reason\nbecause these things belong to god, not to us they can belong to us only if we disappear if we are not in the way, if we allow god to flow through us\nin that absolute let-go\nin that surrender is sannyas sannyas is not surrender to me it is not surrender to anybody in particular it is simply surrender to the whole to this vast, infinite existence and the moment you dissolve yourself in it life becomes a sheer joy\nman without the experience of the divine is nothing but a darkness, an unending darkness a dark night of the soul\nand all hope for the dawn is futile it is not going to come\nunless we invite the divine the dawn cannot come we have to become hosts to the divine that's what meditation is all about creating a receptivity for the divine to come in and the divine certainly comes like a flame the moment the flame enters you you become aflame\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- your whole life is transformed into light the sun does not rise on the outside, it rises within and once there is light within your whole life has a luminosity each act has a tremendous beauty to it, a grace a totality, a passionate intensity each moment\nbecomes so tremendously deep and profound that it starts containing the whole eternity in it all that is needed on our part is to be totally vulnerable, available, open the guest is always knocking on the door but our doors are closed\nthe flame wants to enter in but we don't allow it we live in fear and for thousands of years religions have been teaching people to live in fear in fact they call a religious person a god-fearing person\nthat is sheer nonsense\ngod is nothing to be afraid of a religious person\nis a god-loving person not god-fearing why should he fear?\nand if you are even afraid of god whom are you going to love? -- because god is all my sannyasins have to change the whole gestalt that has been implanted within you by the society i teach love not fear\nand only love can be open\nonly love can be inviting, only love can trust and the moment you trust\nyou can open the doors of your heart and immediately, instantly, the miracle happens the word ecstasy is of immense significance literally it means to stand outside yourself that's the actual meaning of ecstasy standing outside of yourself, standing out of the ego and the moment you are out of the ego you are in god\nto be in the ego\nis to be millions of miles away from god and to be out of the ego\nis to be at the very heart of the divine and if one understands, if one tries to see the point 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- it is not difficult because the ego\nhas never brought any joy to anybody it only brings agony it brings more and more pain more and more suffering ego is like a wound\nthat continuously hurts and is very touchy to come out of the ego is to be healed is to be whole, is to be holy and to come out of the ego nothing else is needed only one thing\na deep insight into the very phenomenon of the ego what it has brought\nit promises much but it never delivers the goods n the whole history of humanity not a single person has been able to say ego has given me bliss and all the persons who have lived blissfully have said, without any exception that bliss has happened\nonly when they dropped the ego the mathematics is very simple it is one of the most absolute laws of life without any exception\nit is the very science of religion get out of the ego and suddenly the spring comes and thousands of flowers start blossoming in you sannyas is a divine revolution it is not a modification, a reformation it is revolution\nit is dropping the past absolutely and entering into a totally new dimension only then one can taste what godliness is if you carry your past with you, you remain old and every day you go on becoming older because the past becomes bigger and bigger and heavier and heavier\nif you drop the whole past and start afresh you are again young\nand only the young consciousness can have a contact with the divine because there is nothing in between if you are carrying the past then the past functions as a barrier, as a wall it is a china wall, very thick and it goes on growing thicker\nevery moment because every moment the past is becoming bigger something is added to the past 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- sannyas begins when you drop the past and suddenly you feel a weightlessness, as if you can fly and then one has to remember not to accumulate the past again then one has to die every moment to the past so that one is reborn every moment to the present that's the only true way to live dying to the past\nliving in the present\nthat contains my whole religion man is capable of melting and merging into his own innermost core and that is the space where absolute silence reigns where no noise has ever penetrated it is against nature and the law of nature no noise can ever enter into your innermost shrine the silence is virgin\nbut it is not a dead silence it is very alive, it is full of music it has a song of its own\nthe Sound of one hand Clapping\nit has a dance of its own\nbut it is impossible to express it in language language is made to express the noise of the mind beyond the mind is your silence hence there is no way to express it but it can be experienced\nand that's the only thing that matters: experience and its experience transforms you then your whole life becomes a celebration a subtle undercurrent of joy permeates you pervades you\nyou live in the world\nyou live in the whole noise of the world but now it doesn't matter because now\nit cannot distract you from your inner centre to know that inner space 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- is to know the centre of the cyclone and then the cyclone too is beautiful you remain centred in all kinds of situations success or failure, poverty or richness, life or death the inner centering remains the same to attain it is the goal of sannyas the knowledgeable person\nhas no way to know the divine because his knowledgeability gives him great ego knowledge\nis the most ego-nourishing phenomenon far more than money, political power, etcetera because political power can be taken away money can be lost, your bank can go bankrupt it is easy to lose it\nbut knowledge is something which nobody can take away from you hence it gives the ego the most stable ground the knowledgeable person has never known god hence jesus says be like a small child again and again he repeats it unless you are like a small child you will not enter into my kingdom of god to nicodemus he says unless you are born again it is not possible to experience the divine the whole insistence is on innocence the same innocence as the child has drop all your knowledge\nit is rubbish, it has no inner value in fact it is a disvalue it is not a qualification for the inner world but a disqualification unburden yourself from knowledge and then innocence will be discovered and that is really treasure once you have tasted your own innocence you have tasted god -- it is the same call it innocence, call it godliness these are different names for the same experience silence has three gates to pass one is the most peripheral: speaking speak only\ntelegraphically speak the essential and you will be surprised 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- that almost ninety per cent of your talking is useless only ten per cent will do\nand you will also be surprised that ten per cent will become more effective because that ninety per cent that unnecessary burden\nis no more there\nwords become more pregnant when you don't go round-about when you go directly\nand if one has to be telegraphic one has to go directly\nthat's why you can write a long letter but it doesn't have that effect a small telegram is more effective in india this is a common practice people will write long letters and in the end they will write think of it as a telegram\nbut how to think after such a long letter?\na telegram has to be telegraphic all the great scriptures of the world are telegraphic that is the meaning of the sanskrit word sutra just a hint has been given but very pregnant this is the first step\nbe telegraphic, speak the essential and drop the non-essential and then the second step\nthink only the essential and you will be surprised\nninety-nine per cent is unessential only one percent maybe is essential that too i say maybe, perhaps otherwise it is all holy cow dung so drop thinking unnecessarily about unnecessary things\nand people are thinking about all kinds of things relevant, irrelevant\ni receive such questions\nwhy do dogs bark at the moon?\nnow the person who is thinking this question is really a great thinker\nhe is neither a dog, nor is he a moon what is his concern about it? Let the dogs bark it is something between the dog and the moon you are unnecessarily poking your nose in it 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- but just curiosity and people go on thinking about useless things so drop useless thinking\nand you will be saving so much energy that the third step can be taken the third step is the most subtle feel only the essential\nand if you come to the essential then there is only love anger, greed, lust\nall these things are non-essential they are parasites, they are exploiting you when you come to the essential only love remains and when your heart is only full of love you can enter into the very centre of silence these three things have to be passed the outer part of the mind -- talking the inner part of the mind -- thinking and the innermost part of the mind -- feeling and when you have passed all these three then there is silence\nand that silence is the door to the divine freedom is one of the most fundamental things and we are living in all kinds of bondages the bondage of a certain church the bondage of a certain race the bondage of a certain nationality and so on and so forth\nthese are all imprisonments, prisons within prisons and if one really wants to know the truth one has to get out of all this stupidity that humanity has been carrying for thousands of years\none has just to be a consciousness a pure consciousness that is freedom\nneither hindu nor mohammedan nor christian neither atheist nor theist, neither black nor white these are non-essential things one should not get lost\nin the jungle of the non-essential the essential thing is your consciousness and consciousness\nis neither hindu nor mohammedan nor christian nor jew\nit is not even masculine or feminine it is neither black nor white it is neither young nor old 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- no category is applicable to it it is beyond all categories hence it has immense freedom freedom is divine\nbecause it allows you to know the truth freedom means freedom from all prejudices from all a priori conclusions a child met the priest of the town in the garden he said good morning, father the priest looked at the child, a beautiful child and the way he greeted him he asked him, but i never see you in the church the child said, that's true because i don't belong to your abomination these denominations are really abominations these churches, these temples, these mosques are nothing but beautiful ways of creating prisoners be free so that you can be yourself initiation into sannyas is initiation into freedom into being yourself\ni don't give you any creed, any dogma any abomination\ni simply want you to be utterly yourself and then god is not far away he is just by the corner\nwe have not lost anything, we have just forgotten god is still there, truth is still there love is still there, bliss is still there nothing has been lost but we have forgotten it we are living in a kind of sleep we need a certain awakening and\nthat's the function of a master to hit the disciple\nin such a way that he has to wake up and certainly the master has to be merciless out of compassion he has to be merciless he has to hit hard on the head just a good hit on the head and one wakes up all the methods of meditation 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- are nothing but certain ways of hitting the very source of your sleepiness once you start awakening, just a little wakefulness is enough to remind you of what you have forgotten and then there is no problem then you can start working on your own searching inside, where you have put things and how you forgot\nsati is a beautiful word\nit contains the essential core of all spiritual methods remembering\nso one need not be worried because nothing is lost one should rejoice that even if we have forgotten it is still there\nso just a little effort is needed to wake up just a little effort to come out of your dreams and anything can be of help sometimes even accidents can help just for a moment you lose your sleepiness and suddenly all is remembered this remembrance happens always in a sudden way hence my way is the way of sudden enlightenment one goes on hitting one's head against many things because one never knows which hit from what source, is going to help it may be the same pillow that you hit or the same pillar again and again one never knows\nit may be the ninety-ninth number or the hundredth but there comes a point when remembrance happens\nsometimes it can happen even in the first hit it depends how thick is the sleepiness, how dense people have different layers it depends on their conditioning how they have been conditioned every child has been conditioned so every child will need a certain hit to be with a master\nis possible only if you love immensely because the master is going to hit you\nunless you trust you won't allow anybody to hit you it is going to be a surgical operation you have to trust the surgeon 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- because you will be on the table, under chloroform and who knows what the surgeon is going to do?\ni have heard about a jew\nwho was going to be operated upon he said wait he took out his purse\nand started counting his money the doctor said\nthere is no need to pay right now you can pay later on he said who is going to pay?\ni am simply counting my money because when i am under chloroform, who knows?\ni don't trust you\nhe is trusting him for the operation but he cannot trust for the money money seems to be more valuable to people than their life itself\nbut to be with a master one has to understand it that love is more valuable than life itself the relationship between a master and a disciple is a love affair\nit is the highest peak of trust because it is the greatest operation there is no other operation bigger than this your whole life has to be transformed it is possible -- one just has to allow it one has to open one's heart so that one is always ready to welcome the unknown, the unknowable we live in the known\nand we are afraid of the unknown so we keep our doors closed to the unknown what to say about the unknowable?\nto allow the unknown to enter we are not even ready\nbut to live in the known means to live in a rut it is boring\nthat's why the whole humanity seems so bored utterly bored, bored with everything unless one opens doors to the unknown life never becomes a joy, a deep adventure the moment you open the doors for the unknown the moment you welcome the unknown you are allowing new, fresh winds to come in the rain, the sun, the stars 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- the fragrance of the flowers and with all these, slowly slowly comes the divine first you have to be open to the unknown and when you have started enjoying then you can risk one step more you can go a little deeper you can become open to the unknowable the world of the unknown\nis the world of poetry, music, dance the world of aesthetics and the world of the unknowable is the world of religion\nand the world of the known is the world of business marketplace, ordinary existence day-to-day existence\na sannyasin first has to be open to the unknown and then finally to the unknowable that is the meaning of swagat: a welcoming heart and then the impossible becomes possible there are two ways to approach the divine one is of meditation, awareness the other is of love\nboth are valid ways, their starting point is different but their ultimate goal is the same they meet when you have reached and not only that they meet at one point in the end if you have followed the way of meditation then love comes as a shadow to it, as a by-product if you have followed the way of love then meditation comes as a shadow of it as a consequence of it\nthey happen together finally but the starting point can be different for you my suggestion is\nlove will be the best way to follow love the whole existence, love as much as you can because the more you love\nthe more capable of love you will become this is the law of love\nthe more vou love the more love vou have the less you love the less love you have when you love infinitely\nyou start having an inexhaustible love within you some sources that have remained always hidden suddenly open up\nsome springs which have never been flowing 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- start flowing but one has to be unconditional: love but don't ask anything in return love for the sheer joy of love and then wait for the miracle it happens, it happens inevitably just one has to love and wait sow the seeds of love and wait and the moment certainly comes when those seeds start sprouting they start becoming plants, leaves start growing foliage comes, then buds\nthen flowers and the fragrance that fragrance is godliness love is the beginning, godliness is the end The Sound of One Hand Clapping Chapter #20\n\u003c Previous |

there is no way to express it but it can be experienced</p><p>and that's the only thing that matters: experience and its experience
transforms you then your whole life becomes a celebration a subtle
undercurrent of joy permeates you pervades you</p><p>you live in the world</p><p>you live in the whole noise of the world but now it doesn't matter

great ego knowledge</p><p>is the most ego-nourishing phenomenon far more than money, political
power, etcetera because political power can be taken away money can be
lost, your bank can go bankrupt it is easy to lose it</p><p>but knowledge is something which nobody can take away from you hence
it gives the ego the most stable ground the knowledgeable person has
never known god hence jesus says be like a small child again and again
he repeats it unless you are like a small child you will not enter into

point when remembrance happens</p><p>sometimes it can happen even in the first hit it depends how thick is
the sleepiness, how dense people have different layers it depends on

conditioned so every child will need a certain hit to be with a

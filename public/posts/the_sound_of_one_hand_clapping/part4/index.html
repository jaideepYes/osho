because prayer is basically a demand in fact deep down it is a complaint you are asking for something more it is not gratitude\nit is just the opposite of gratitude hence, what goes on\nin the churches and the temples and the mosques and the synagogues is not honour for existence the real honour can be only one to rejoice\nin existence's absolute ordinariness in the small things\nbecause there are no great things eating, drinking, sleeping, walking, sitting looking at the stars or at the trees just small things\nlife consists of all these small things but if you know how to rejoice then the ordinary becomes extraordinary then you know the magic of transformation then the mundane is no more mundane it becomes sacred\nand to make the mundane sacred is the whole philosophy of sannyas 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- there is only one real marriage and that is marriage to bliss in fact all other\nmarriages are indirect ways of reaching bliss but when there is a direct route why unnecessarily go by an indirect route?\nand the experience of thousands of years is that the people who go through the indirect never reach\nthere are a thousand and one obstacles they get distracted\nthey search for bliss but they attain only misery they hope for heaven but what they gain is only hell existence has to be approached directly not via anything, no mediator is needed and the direct approach to existence is what i call meditation\nwithout any mediator without anybody\nstanding between you and existence when you encounter existence in its tremendous beauty\nbliss starts showering and it goes on showering it knows no end\nthere is only one marriage worthwhile and that is being wedded to bliss directly sannyas can be defined as a marriage to bliss avoiding all other husbands and wives and when you have avoided all in between the philosophies, the religions, the dogmas it is so close\nthat there is not even a single inch's difference the difference is created by the indirect approach the distance is created by people who are standing between you and the whole there is no need for anybody no messenger, no prophet is needed god is yours\nexistence is yours as much as anybody else's one should take an immediate plunge yes\none hesitates a little before one plunges into the ultimate depths of life 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- that hesitation is natural but one has to put that hesitation aside one has to be courageous\nand it is a single moment's courage that does the magic\nit is just like jumping into cold water if you go on standing on the bank you can go on standing for lives it is only a question\nof a single moment of courage and risk throw off your clothes and jump in yes it is cold... but only for a moment and then it has tremendous beauty and tremendous freshness\naliveness\nthe false aristocrat is an aristocrat because of birth which is not much, which has no significance birth is the same\nwhether you are born in an emperor's home or in a beggar's home the womb is the same\nthe queen's womb or the beggar woman's womb it makes no difference at all the real aristocracy comes from a second birth that is the meaning of sujato when you become blissful\nwhen you become silent when you become loving when you become aware\nwhen a second birth happens which is the birth of your consciousness of your real being\nnot of the body, but of the being and then one has a certain aristocracy such a person may not have anything he may be a beggar\nbut you will see the grace of the emperor in him you will see him surrounded by a subtle aura of the beyond he is really born\nothers are only half-born\nthey are in a kind of limbo. physically born but psychologically still waiting for birth socrates says, i am a midwife 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- that s exactly the function of a master to help you attain the second birth in india, when a person becomes awakened we call him twice-born, dwija one who has been born again the first birth\nbrings you out of the physical womb the second birth\nbrings you out of the psychological womb the first birth brings you out of the physical womb into the psychological\nit creates mind\nthe second birth takes you out of the psychological and brings you to the spiritual it gives you being\nand being is immortality, deathlessness the only criterion that the second birth has happened is total blissfulness\nin all situations unaffected, untouched by whatsoever happens around failure or success, richness or poverty youth or old age, life or death the wheel of the opposites goes on moving but the man who knows bliss remains centred, unmoved\nhe is the unmoving centre of a moving wheel the centre of the cyclone\nthere are many kinds of beauties there is the physical beauty which is only momentary\nit may be there today and tomorrow it is gone in fact it is bound to\nin fact it is already going down the drain slipping out of your hands every moment the second layer of beauty is psychological it is of intellect, of aesthetic sensibility the man who has a musical ear or the man who has the sensitivity of a\npainter in his eyes\nhis beauty is far deeper than the physical sometimes it happens that the person may be physiologically ugly for example 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- socrates was very ugly, snub-nosed but psychologically, a man of immense beauty if one saw him from far away he was repulsive but if one came in close contact then one would enter\ninto a totally different kind of man because he had such a keen intelligence rarely surpassed\nand such sensibility\nsuch aesthetic transparency that once you looked into his psyche you would completely forget his body the same seems to be true about jesus physiologically he was not beautiful but psychologically one of the most beautiful men who has ever walked on the earth but there is still a third the ultimate layer of beauty that is of being, is absolutely of your interiority to understand that\nseeing the body is not enough experiencing the person's intelligence and sensitivity is not enough\nfor that only a disciple\none who is absolutely surrendered open, vulnerable, is needed that's what sannyas is all about being in tune with the master at the deepest level of beauty by-passing the physiological, the psychological just going like an arrow\nnot being stuck\nat the physiological or the psychological but hitting deep down\ninto the very core of the master only then do you know the ultimate beauty and\nthere resides bliss\nthe physiological beauty may give you pleasure the psychological can give you happiness but only the spiritual can give you bliss it opens the doors of the kingdom of bliss so one can do two things\neither one discovers one's being and in that very discovery one becomes blissful 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- or one starts becoming blissful and in becoming blissful one discovers one's being both are the same\ndifferent aspects of the same phenomenon if you want to enter from the first door then meditate then be silent\nand drown yourself deeper and deeper down to the very rock-bottom of your being there you will find yourself and bliss\nas a shadow\nor, if that is not your liking the feminine mind particularly does not like meditation very much it is natural\nthat's why there have been very few women buddhas not that there is any intrinsic obstruction for a woman to become a buddha the only reason has been that all the male buddhas have been talking about meditation and meditation\ndoes not have much appeal for the woman she needs a totally different approach she will be more interested in blissfulness in something orgasmic\nin something which is closer to dance, music, poetry in something to which she can abandon herself totally not in something\nwhich is a question of self-remembering meditation means self-remembering and blissfulness means forgetting the self totally when you begin they look\nopposite remembering and forgetting are certainly opposites but when you reach closer to your being they become one\nremembering the self brings you to the real self the unreal self is dropped on the way and in forgetting the self from the very beginning you start dropping the false self a moment comes when the false self is abandoned and the real arises of its own accord my effort here is to create a balance which has been lacking up to now 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- religion has been dominated too much by the male mind it has been a calamity\nthe woman has been unnecessarily deprived it is very difficult to find women of the calibre of buddha\nzarathustra, lao tzu\ndifficult for the simple reason that the method they chose was male-oriented so i am creating a synthesis here those who are male-oriented a few women are male-oriented it is not necessarily so that no woman will be interested in meditation there are a few women\nwho will reach through meditation and there are a few men who will reach through blissfulness but those are exceptions and exceptions cannot be counted they only prove the rule so for you\nmy suggestion is be more blissful dance, sing, be a drunkard and then it will be easier once the door opens for the drunken people then thousands of women who have been waiting for millions of years to become buddhas and they are all arriving here this may be the first place where thousands of women will become buddhas i count courage\nas being the most significant religious quality although in the past just the opposite has been the case cowards, only cowards\nout of fear, afraid of death hell, punishment, judgement day have been religious\nout of fear they were praying doing all kinds of stupid rituals, following utter fools but their orientation was such that they could not be rebellious they were afraid of rebellion, they had to be obedient obedience has been taught to them as the most fundamental religious quality it is not\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- it may be a quality in an army but it is not a quality of a religious man it is a subtle method of regimentation the religious person\nhas to be courageous enough to explore because truth cannot be given by the scriptures it is untransferrable\nbliss cannot be transmitted to you by somebody else\nyou have to seek and search and you have to travel alone and you have to go onto untravelled paths because there are not asphalt ways no superhighways where crowds can go and buses can go and tourists can go one has to go alone\nand one has to create one's path oneself by walking on it\nthe path is not already there, it is not readymade buddha is reported to have said that the way of the true seeker is like a bird flying in the sky it leaves no footprints\nso no other bird can follow it because there are no footprints left there are no footprints at all existence always remains the same mystery many have experienced it\nbut nobody has been able to demystify it nobody will ever be able to demystify it\nbecause when you experience it, it is inexpressible you cannot put it into words, into theories and if one is courageous\nbliss starts from the very beginning just the idea that you are going into the exploration of the unknown is enough to give the heart a new beat\na fresh breeze, a new joy a rebirth, a resurrection\ntruth, bliss, freedom, godliness, love these are all aspects of one experience and that experience is available only to the courageous, to the rebellious be a rebel\nsannyas is a rebellion\na rebellion against all tradition a rebellion against all the rotten past 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- a rebellion against all that is dead and a search for the living a search which will need\nmany many risks to be taken adventures to be accepted challenges to be encountered but it is a joy\nit is bliss all the way from the beginning to the end one just has to learn the taste of exploration and then\neach moment becomes more and more alive more and more festive more and more celebrating\nand the ultimate celebration is when you have found that you are bliss\nthat bliss is not something outside you that you are god\nthat god is not something outside you that you are freedom, that you are liberation in that moment the ultimate dance happens it simply explodes\nin that explosion you are lost and only that which is truth remains that truth is the longing of every heart man has been told again and again to be perfect that is a wrong beginning\nto tell somebody to be perfect is to drive him nuts that's why the whole of humanity is almost living in a madhouse perfection is not something that one can achieve it is a by-product of blissfulness remember the word by-product you cannot achieve it directly it comes as a shadow of blissfulness so i don't say to you to be perfect i say to you to be blissful and perfection will follow of its own accord in its own time\nand who cares for perfection? if you have a need\nit is only the miserable person who cares for perfection the blissful person has no need for it 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- and this is one of the fundamental laws of life if you are in need you will not get it existence functions\nalmost on the same lines as banking the bank is not going to give to you if you don't have any need the bank is after you existence is always willing to give to you if you don't need\nthe needy person is a beggar and existence does not like beggars the person who is blissful is an emperor and existence loves emperors so be blissful, rejoice\nand don t bother about perfection it comes it inevitably comes\nand when it comes on its own it has a tremendous beauty my only discipline is to be blissful no other discipline is needed no moral commandments\nno shoulds, should-nots\njust a simple message to be blissful in whatsoever you can be, be blissful and if one can imbibe the spirit of bliss then many things follow\na blissful person is bound to be loving you need not tell him love thy neighbour as thyself you need not tell him love thy enemy as thyself because when somebody\ntries to love their neighbour that love is false, the very effort makes it false when one tries to love one's enemy one knows perfectly that he is the enemy otherwise, why should one try to love him?\none knows he is the enemy but one has to try because jesus says so\nand that is the only way to reach paradise so it has to be done somehow one pretends, one creates a pseudo kind of love and the pseudo kind of love is very saccharin It is not even sugar, it is not even sweet it is saccharin, it tastes a little bitter and because it is false\nthe other person will immediately see it as false 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- and will feel humiliated, insulted friedrich nietzsche has said, and said rightly that jesus is not right when he says if somebody hits you on one of your cheeks give him the other too\nand i agree with nietzsche far more in that matter because he says\nthis is very insulting to the other person it is humiliating\nyou are trying to be superior and higher you are trying to be superhuman you are\nreducing the other person to a cockroach he is also a man, he needs equality you are trying to be superior i agree with nietzsche\nif somebody hits you on one cheek give him a good hit on the other immediately that proves equality\nit does not give you the idea of holier-than-thou of look, you are hitting me and i am giving you my other cheek you are just an ordinary human being i am a saint, a sage\nthat is very egoistic\nbut this is bound to happen if you try to cultivate qualities love, compassion, mercy\nwhen cultivated become bogus, false, facades they should come out of your blissfulness yes, if you are so blissful that you enjoyed one hit on the cheek give him the other also\nnot because you are being superior but because you enjoyed it that's a totally different approach you are telling him please, one more it brought me to my senses i loved it it made me a little awakened you will be obliged to the person because he has hit you\nyou will not be condescending you will not be trying in any way to be superior if you are full of bliss, you will share your bliss that is natural\nbut you will not be serving people 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- you will be sharing service is ugly, sharing is beautiful when you serve somebody you hurt him you humiliate him\nall christian missionaries are humiliating they are searching for the cripples, for the widows what kind of people are these J\nif they don't find any widows or any orphans or any cripples they will be at a loss\nwhat to do?\nhow to reach god?\nthe whole ladder has disappeared they are stepping on these people's heads they are making their way to god these are stepping stones, not people a man of bliss shares\nit is not a question\nof whether the person needs it or not he simply shares because he has too much out of abundance he shares hence my only discipline is be blissful and everything else follows it man has tried in many ways to be silent because the world is too noisy it is too much, it is very loud it creates great tension, anxiety, anguish hence a natural idea arises in the mind of man about how to get rid of it how to hide yourself in some sanctuary monastery, mountain, in a desert where nobody disturbs you\nwhere you are left alone to yourself there is great need to be oneself to have one's own space\nthis is a logical conclusion because the world is too heavy and sooner or later a person feels crowded overcrowded, crushed, from all sides suffocated because of this suffocation religion became an escape\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- the conclusion is logical but not real not existential you can escape from the world but you cannot escape from yourself and the real cause of noise is within you not in the world\nyou will quarrel with the monks in the monastery nuns will compete and be\njealous of each other even in the desert, sitting alone a crow will start disturbing you and that will be enough, in a desert that is enough in the marketplace\nyou could have forgotten the crow but in the desert a single crow is enough wherever you go\nyou will carry your mind, your reactions and if there is nothing to worry about you will start worrying about nothing what am i doing here?\nis it right to be here?\nis it good to sit alone in the desert when the whole world is suffering? this is escapism\nand perhaps i am missing something who knows?\nlife is a great opportunity and i am sitting in the desert doing nothing you will become disturbed about it you will create new kinds of problems for yourself mind grows problems just like trees grow leaves the conclusion is logical but not real not of real help\nso i don't suggest escapism, i suggest an alchemy to transform your inner being into a song your inner noise into a song because a song\nis nothing but a transformation of noise what is music after all?\njust noise arranged in a beautiful way the same orchestra can drive you crazy just put together thirty crazy musicians who are not in tune with each other at all and that will be enough\nthe same orchestra, the same instruments can create something celestial 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- something of the beyond it is the same noise\njust a little different arrangement escape is not needed\nbut a different alchemy is needed so i don't say leave the world i say change your attitude, your approach rather than searching\nfor an empty space somewhere search for a blissful song within create it\nall that is needed is available it just has to be put in the right combination every ingredient is already given you just have to mix it\nmix it artfully. intelligently and once you have created\nthe song of bliss within you you will be surprised that the whole world has no more difficulties for you you go singing in the marketplace you can sit in the madhouse with absolute joy in fact you can enjoy the mad people i have been doing that for my whole life what do you think i am doing right now?\ncollecting all kinds of crazies, cuckoos and enjoying it, really enjoying it they are beautiful people\nsomebody just needs to know how to enjoy them somebody needs a certain insight i used to visit the madhouses then finally i dropped it\nbecause i saw that the whole earth is a madhouse what is the point of going behind walls outside the walls is the same place once you have an inner tune then nothing disturbs you\nthen the whole existence becomes a song and a song that contains silence a silence that contains song when song and silence both meet together the ultimate is achieved\nthe Sound of one hand Clapping 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- The

real honour because prayer is basically a demand in fact deep down it is
a complaint you are asking for something more it is not gratitude</p><p>it is just the opposite of gratitude hence, what goes on</p><p>in the churches and the temples and the mosques and the synagogues is
not honour for existence the real honour can be only one to rejoice</p><p>in existence's absolute ordinariness in the small things</p><p>because there are no great things eating, drinking, sleeping,
walking, sitting looking at the stars or at the trees just small
things</p><p>life consists of all these small things but if you know how to
rejoice then the ordinary becomes extraordinary then you know the magic
of transformation then the mundane is no more mundane it becomes
sacred</p><p>and to make the mundane sacred is the whole philosophy of sannyas

all other</p><p>marriages are indirect ways of reaching bliss but when there is a
direct route why unnecessarily go by an indirect route?</p><p>and the experience of thousands of years is that the people who go
through the indirect never reach</p><p>there are a thousand and one obstacles they get distracted</p><p>they search for bliss but they attain only misery they hope for
heaven but what they gain is only hell existence has to be approached
directly not via anything, no mediator is needed and the direct approach
to existence is what i call meditation</p><p>without any mediator without anybody</p><p>standing between you and existence when you encounter existence in
its tremendous beauty</p><p>bliss starts showering and it goes on showering it knows no end</p><p>there is only one marriage worthwhile and that is being wedded to
bliss directly sannyas can be defined as a marriage to bliss avoiding
all other husbands and wives and when you have avoided all in between
the philosophies, the religions, the dogmas it is so close</p><p>that there is not even a single inch's difference the difference is
created by the indirect approach the distance is created by people who
are standing between you and the whole there is no need for anybody no
messenger, no prophet is needed god is yours</p><p>existence is yours as much as anybody else's one should take an
immediate plunge yes</p><p>one hesitates a little before one plunges into the ultimate depths of

one has to be courageous</p><p>and it is a single moment's courage that does the magic</p><p>it is just like jumping into cold water if you go on standing on the
bank you can go on standing for lives it is only a question</p><p>of a single moment of courage and risk throw off your clothes and
jump in yes it is cold... but only for a moment and then it has
tremendous beauty and tremendous freshness</p><p>aliveness</p><p>the false aristocrat is an aristocrat because of birth which is not
much, which has no significance birth is the same</p><p>whether you are born in an emperor's home or in a beggar's home the
womb is the same</p><p>the queen's womb or the beggar woman's womb it makes no difference at
all the real aristocracy comes from a second birth that is the meaning
of sujato when you become blissful</p><p>when you become silent when you become loving when you become
aware</p><p>when a second birth happens which is the birth of your consciousness
of your real being</p><p>not of the body, but of the being and then one has a certain
aristocracy such a person may not have anything he may be a beggar</p><p>but you will see the grace of the emperor in him you will see him
surrounded by a subtle aura of the beyond he is really born</p><p>others are only half-born</p><p>they are in a kind of limbo. physically born but psychologically

birth in india, when a person becomes awakened we call him twice-born,

out of the physical womb into the psychological</p><p>it creates mind</p><p>the second birth takes you out of the psychological and brings you to
the spiritual it gives you being</p><p>and being is immortality, deathlessness the only criterion that the
second birth has happened is total blissfulness</p><p>in all situations unaffected, untouched by whatsoever happens around
failure or success, richness or poverty youth or old age, life or death
the wheel of the opposites goes on moving but the man who knows bliss
remains centred, unmoved</p><p>he is the unmoving centre of a moving wheel the centre of the

is only momentary</p><p>it may be there today and tomorrow it is gone in fact it is bound

every moment the second layer of beauty is psychological it is of
intellect, of aesthetic sensibility the man who has a musical ear or the
man who has the sensitivity of a</p><p>painter in his eyes</p><p>his beauty is far deeper than the physical sometimes it happens that

immense beauty if one saw him from far away he was repulsive but if one
came in close contact then one would enter</p><p>into a totally different kind of man because he had such a keen
intelligence rarely surpassed</p><p>and such sensibility</p><p>such aesthetic transparency that once you looked into his psyche you
would completely forget his body the same seems to be true about jesus
physiologically he was not beautiful but psychologically one of the most
beautiful men who has ever walked on the earth but there is still a
third the ultimate layer of beauty that is of being, is absolutely of
your interiority to understand that</p><p>seeing the body is not enough experiencing the person's intelligence
and sensitivity is not enough</p><p>for that only a disciple</p><p>one who is absolutely surrendered open, vulnerable, is needed that's
what sannyas is all about being in tune with the master at the deepest
level of beauty by-passing the physiological, the psychological just
going like an arrow</p><p>not being stuck</p><p>at the physiological or the psychological but hitting deep down</p><p>into the very core of the master only then do you know the ultimate
beauty and</p><p>there resides bliss</p><p>the physiological beauty may give you pleasure the psychological can
give you happiness but only the spiritual can give you bliss it opens
the doors of the kingdom of bliss so one can do two things</p><p>either one discovers one's being and in that very discovery one
becomes blissful 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--4>Osho's

discovers one's being both are the same</p><p>different aspects of the same phenomenon if you want to enter from
the first door then meditate then be silent</p><p>and drown yourself deeper and deeper down to the very rock-bottom of
your being there you will find yourself and bliss</p><p>as a shadow</p><p>or, if that is not your liking the feminine mind particularly does
not like meditation very much it is natural</p><p>that's why there have been very few women buddhas not that there is
any intrinsic obstruction for a woman to become a buddha the only reason
has been that all the male buddhas have been talking about meditation
and meditation</p><p>does not have much appeal for the woman she needs a totally different
approach she will be more interested in blissfulness in something
orgasmic</p><p>in something which is closer to dance, music, poetry in something to
which she can abandon herself totally not in something</p><p>which is a question of self-remembering meditation means
self-remembering and blissfulness means forgetting the self totally when
you begin they look</p><p>opposite remembering and forgetting are certainly opposites but when
you reach closer to your being they become one</p><p>remembering the self brings you to the real self the unreal self is
dropped on the way and in forgetting the self from the very beginning
you start dropping the false self a moment comes when the false self is
abandoned and the real arises of its own accord my effort here is to
create a balance which has been lacking up to now 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--religion-has-been-dominated-too-much-by-the-male-mind>Osho's

find women of the calibre of buddha</p><p>zarathustra, lao tzu</p><p>difficult for the simple reason that the method they chose was
male-oriented so i am creating a synthesis here those who are
male-oriented a few women are male-oriented it is not necessarily so
that no woman will be interested in meditation there are a few women</p><p>who will reach through meditation and there are a few men who will
reach through blissfulness but those are exceptions and exceptions
cannot be counted they only prove the rule so for you</p><p>my suggestion is be more blissful dance, sing, be a drunkard and then
it will be easier once the door opens for the drunken people then
thousands of women who have been waiting for millions of years to become
buddhas and they are all arriving here this may be the first place where
thousands of women will become buddhas i count courage</p><p>as being the most significant religious quality although in the past
just the opposite has been the case cowards, only cowards</p><p>out of fear, afraid of death hell, punishment, judgement day have
been religious</p><p>out of fear they were praying doing all kinds of stupid rituals,
following utter fools but their orientation was such that they could not
be rebellious they were afraid of rebellion, they had to be obedient
obedience has been taught to them as the most fundamental religious

man it is a subtle method of regimentation the religious person</p><p>has to be courageous enough to explore because truth cannot be given
by the scriptures it is untransferrable</p><p>bliss cannot be transmitted to you by somebody else</p><p>you have to seek and search and you have to travel alone and you have
to go onto untravelled paths because there are not asphalt ways no
superhighways where crowds can go and buses can go and tourists can go
one has to go alone</p><p>and one has to create one's path oneself by walking on it</p><p>the path is not already there, it is not readymade buddha is reported
to have said that the way of the true seeker is like a bird flying in
the sky it leaves no footprints</p><p>so no other bird can follow it because there are no footprints left
there are no footprints at all existence always remains the same mystery
many have experienced it</p><p>but nobody has been able to demystify it nobody will ever be able to
demystify it</p><p>because when you experience it, it is inexpressible you cannot put it
into words, into theories and if one is courageous</p><p>bliss starts from the very beginning just the idea that you are going
into the exploration of the unknown is enough to give the heart a new
beat</p><p>a fresh breeze, a new joy a rebirth, a resurrection</p><p>truth, bliss, freedom, godliness, love these are all aspects of one
experience and that experience is available only to the courageous, to

search which will need</p><p>many many risks to be taken adventures to be accepted challenges to
be encountered but it is a joy</p><p>it is bliss all the way from the beginning to the end one just has to
learn the taste of exploration and then</p><p>each moment becomes more and more alive more and more festive more
and more celebrating</p><p>and the ultimate celebration is when you have found that you are
bliss</p><p>that bliss is not something outside you that you are god</p><p>that god is not something outside you that you are freedom, that you
are liberation in that moment the ultimate dance happens it simply
explodes</p><p>in that explosion you are lost and only that which is truth remains
that truth is the longing of every heart man has been told again and
again to be perfect that is a wrong beginning</p><p>to tell somebody to be perfect is to drive him nuts that's why the
whole of humanity is almost living in a madhouse perfection is not
something that one can achieve it is a by-product of blissfulness
remember the word by-product you cannot achieve it directly it comes as
a shadow of blissfulness so i don't say to you to be perfect i say to
you to be blissful and perfection will follow of its own accord in its
own time</p><p>and who cares for perfection? if you have a need</p><p>it is only the miserable person who cares for perfection the blissful

willing to give to you if you don't need</p><p>the needy person is a beggar and existence does not like beggars the
person who is blissful is an emperor and existence loves emperors so be

so</p><p>and that is the only way to reach paradise so it has to be done

blissful and everything else follows it man has tried in many ways to be
silent because the world is too noisy it is too much, it is very loud it
creates great tension, anxiety, anguish hence a natural idea arises in

oneself to have one's own space</p><p>this is a logical conclusion because the world is too heavy and

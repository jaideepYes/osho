suspicious, doubting one can never be pure purity is the quality of the heart just as mind is intrinsically cunning the heart is intrinsically innocent mind can be knowledgeable, heart can be wise mind can be learned\nthe heart can be childlike, innocent and all that is great happens in the heart not in the mind\nsannyas is initiation into the ways of the heart it is getting out of the imprisonment of the mind and entering into the freedom of the heart it is a simple process\nall that is needed is a little courage to trust a little courage to put doubts aside a little courage to risk\nand then miracles start happening and they go on happening each moment life becomes just incredible a long, long, orgasmic ecstatic joy 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- mind stinks it cannot avoid it, its very functioning is rotten it lives on the old, the dead, the past it feeds on corpses\nhence there is no possibility of fragrance as far as mind is concerned and all people are living in the mind hence life has become a chaos a very muddy, confused affair it has lost all the celebration no flowers grow anywhere\nas far as human consciousness is concerned only thorns, bloody thorns but hidden\nbehind the thick layers of the mind and its crap is a beautiful source which we have brought from the beyond our heart\nit is still beating\nits beat goes on becoming farther and farther away because the mind goes on accumulating junk you cannot hear its beat, you cannot taste its joy its fragrance is ready to be released the hindrances have to be removed and the only hindrance is the mind all other hindrances are part of the mind greed, jealousy, desire, possessiveness, anger, ego these are all aspects of the mind rather than fighting with each aspect separately which is an unnecessarily long process maybe unending\nthe best way\nis to cut the whole mind in a single blow that's what sannyas is all about beheading yourself\nand the moment you put the whole mind aside and it is only a question of decisiveness immediately something new\nwhich has never been felt within you starts arising a fragrance\nlife starts becoming a light unto itself life starts taking the colours the rainbow colours of love festivity, music, poetry, creativity, sensitivity the same energies which were involved 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- in greed, anger, possessiveness, jealousy are released and the same energies start moving into a totally different terrain, into a new dimension all that is needed on the part of my sannyasins is to shift their energies from the head to the heart trust the heart, try to live the heart wherever it leads go with it without any doubt, without any fear follow the heart and you will be following true religion follow the mind\nand you will be following\nchristianity, hinduism, mohammedanism all untrue religions\nthe true religion is basically individual and the untrue is collective mind is part of the collective and the heart is your individual source people are living a life of curse and nobody else is responsible for it that is the strangest thing about it they themselves are responsible they have got caught in a pattern, a vicious circle they go on moving in the wheel clinging tightly to the wheel and the wheel is crushing them mind is a wheel with many spokes but exactly in the centre of the wheel there is something unmoving unless we touch that centre that unmoving centre of all movement we can never feel the benediction of existence it is always there, within our reach any moment we can dive deep into it but we cling to the wheel\nand the faster it moves the more afraid we are and so we cling more tightly we cling to our doubts\nnot seeing a simple fact\nthat a person who lives in doubts cannot be blissful doubt can only create misery because it is negative it is darkness\nit is not light\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- it can create suspicion, it can create fear it can create a persecution-mania it can create violence\nbut it cannot create bliss but still people brag about their doubting mind they think it is something great they talk about their scepticism they think it is something philosophical it is sheer stupidity but they make much fuss because they have made it an investment of their life they cling to their greed\nknowing perfectly well that it is unfulfillable and when you cling to something which is unfulfillable\nyou will remain miserable\nwherever you are misery will haunt you you will be asking for more and more and whenever you ask for more you will feel frustrated\nbecause it is never coming even if it comes your demand grows the demand grows in the same proportion so you remain as hungry, as beggarly as ever and this is the case with everything anger, pessimism\nalways seeing the negative side of life there are people\nif you take them to a rose bush they will count the thorns first they will count the thorns roses don't matter; what matters is thorns and then their fingers are bloody and they are hurting\nand then they become so angry and their eyes become so antagonistic towards the rose bush\nthat it becomes impossible to see the roses a thick fog of anger surrounds them this is our doing\na sannyasin has to be aware of all this nonsense if you go to a rose bush, dance around it look at the roses\nrejoice in the roses see the miracle\namongst thousands of flowers a rose has blossomed 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- what more mystery can there be? jesus walking on water is nothing compared to it in fact if you walk on water you will only look silly a rose growing in the thorns is really a miracle and once you have seen the rose, the positive you are shifting your gears from the mind to the heart from cunningness to innocence from negativity to positivity and then life becomes an eternal song the purest experience in life is that of love sex is not love, it is biological prayer is not love, it is theological the first -- sex, which is misunderstood by many as love\nis below human consciousness it belongs to our past, it is just a hangover the second is only a fiction -- the prayer that, too, really belongs to our past out of fear man started praying to god in fact, out of fear he created god god is nothing but fear personified so one is biological\nanother is just religious, superstitious between the two is the golden mean something of immense value that is love\nit is more than sex and more than prayer it is the fragrance of human consciousness it is the flowering of consciousness itself hence i put love\nas the highest expression of all that is great\njesus says god is love; i say love is god because when you say god is love that simply means\ngod may have many other qualities love is only one of the qualities of god god is important, love is only one of the aspects to me love is god\nlove is the real thing\ngodliness is only one of the qualities of love my message is beyond biology and beyond theology 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- my message is simply that of expanding human consciousness and love\nis nothing but sharing of your consciousness with as many people as possible not only with people, with animals, with trees with birds, with clouds, with stars the whole emphasis is on sharing not with whom\nthe address is not important sharing\nthe sheer joy of sharing your being is love and that is the purest phenomenon the holiest of the holy\nthe most sacred\nand it is hidden in the very ordinariness of our lives so we are not to go anywhere to search for it we have to dig it\nnow and here\nand within ourselves\nthe heart is naturally contented it never asks for more\nwhatsoever is, is more than enough mind is naturally discontented whatsoever is, is never enough more is needed hence mind lives in a constant struggle with existence never at ease, always tense always anxious, worried\nanguish has become its very centre just the opposite is the case with the heart there is no conflict, no struggle as each moment unfolds the heart lives it with joy with gratitude, with immense thankfulness because it is a gift of the whole we don't deserve it at all if next moment i die\nthere is no court of appeal for it i cannot say to anybody why\nwhy could i not exist for a few minutes more? we all know it\nstill we go on taking for granted whatsoever is given to us this is one of the ugly traits of the mind it never feels grateful 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- hence mind can never be religious gratefulness is the core of religion, the very core move from the discontented world of the mind to the contented world of the near and small things are so blissful just a cup of tea\njust sipping the tea, savouring its taste and flavour is as great an ecstasy\nas any buddha has achieved in his samadhi there is no difference at all the question is not\nwhether you are sitting underneath a tree and meditating\nor sitting in your room and sipping tea the question is of the heart if the heart is contented in the moment then whether under the tree, in the mountains or in the room, it makes no difference the contented heart knows the beauties of existence the mysteries of life\nall the doors open for it\nexistence is closed for the mind open for the heart existence is closed for the cunning open for the pure god to me is not a person\nbut only a presence, an experience like love, like joy, like beauty you cannot encounter joy\nyou cannot meet joy and say, hello how are you? you cannot because joy\nis not something separate from you joy is an experience, so is the case with joy so my expression for god is godliness linguistically, gramatically, it does not look right so i go on using the word god but whenever i use the word god i mean godliness purity is godliness\nand by purity i don't mean a moral purity following the ten commandments you become pure\nthat is not purity; that is sheer cunningness those ten commandments are basically jewish it is a business proposal, it is pure business it is arranging for the other world creating a bank balance there 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- if god wants these things to be done only then you will be allowed in so okay, we will do these things but it is only a doing\nnot your being\nat the core of your being you remain the same following all the commandments and the real purity is not of doing but of being one has to be innocent in the being then who cares about the heavenly pleasures and who cares about paradise?\nthen paradise is herenow\nthen it is not a question of tomorrow so i don't teach the purity of so-called moral disciplines i only teach one purity\nthe purity of changing the gestalt from the mind to the heart becoming more heart-full is becoming pure becoming less mind-full is becoming more pure the moment mind is completely gone and there is only heart -- throbbing, dancing you have arrived home\nand that is the moment\nthe presence of godliness is felt not something outer to you but something within your very soul a flame of your own consciousness purity is a light\nmind is always a dark night of the soul there is no dawn in it\nthe night continues, it is an eternal night darkness is its very nature the heart lives always in the dawn it is always light there\nso it is not a question of bringing light to the mind the question is changing\nthe altitude of your existence changing the plane, the dimension if one remains in the mind one will remain in darkness if one changes from the mind to the heart suddenly the light bursts forth it is like standing in the sun with closed eyes you are in darkness and there is light everywhere you are creating your own darkness 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- by closing your eyes just open the eyes and you start laughing you see the ridiculousness of it all that you were the cause of your darkness that light was always there and you were unnecessarily missing it it was showering on you, available but you were preventing it from reaching you mind is a barrier to light and we are making great efforts to make this mind bigger and bigger the whole educational system consists only of making this mind bigger and bigger one-third of a human life\ntwenty-five years are wasted just puffing the balloon of the mind bigger and\nbigger\nand it is an empty balloon, there is nothing in it nobody has ever achieved anything in it not a single human being in the whole of history has said, i have attained contentment through mind blissfulness through mind\nimmortality through mind\ntruth through mind, love through mind not a single statement, without any exception.\nmind has proved utterly impotent but still we go on carrying the old, rotten tradition of making it bigger and bigger that man is almost crushed underneath it the mind has become mountainous and man is not even able to crawl out of it but because we have created it and because it is only an empty balloon just a pinprick is enough\nnothing else is needed sannyas is that pinprick and the balloon bursts\nand suddenly there is rejoicing as the air goes out of the balloon the hot air -- and it is very hot --\nsuddenly a cool breeze starts arising in you instead of darkness, light instead of a burdensome life, a dancing quality instead of living for tomorrow the joy in the moment\nthe freshness of the moment 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- the beauty of the moment, possesses you and to be possessed by the moment is all there is nothing more to it the greatest experience in life is the experience of being nothing, nobody people are trying to be somebody in some way or other\nin worldly ways, in other-worldly ways through money, power, prestige, knowledge, austerities\nbut the desire is the same to be somebody in particular, to be at the top it is such a childish game the politicians are involved in it the saints are involved in it the politicians can be forgiven because they are basically stupid people but how to forgive the saints?\nthey are also on the same trip of being somebody special\nwhen jesus was leaving his disciples the last question they asked was now that you are leaving us you are being caught and you may be crucified we have only one enquiry\nthat in the kingdom of god, of course you will be at his right hand but who will be next to you?\ndo you see these fools?\ntheir desire, the whole ego trip sannyas is seeing the foolishness of the ego trip and the very seeing is transforming the moment you see that it is utterly stupid there is no point in being somebody one is perfectly beautiful as one is and the more you are a nobody the more you are at ease, relaxed the more you are a nothingness the less there is any possibility of worry, anxiety, anguish nothingness cannot be stirred into a worry for what?\nthere is nothing to lose\nthere is nothing to be afraid of there is nothing to miss the man who has achieved nothingness 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- is really the richest man in the world he is really in the kingdom of god he is really an emperor\nand we are all entitled to achieve it we just have to be a little more clear about\nthe whole trip in which we have been forced by the society, by the parents by the people who have surrounded us by the people who have conditioned us we just have to see the point that we have been dragged\ninto an unnecessary turmoil then drop out of it and drop in drop out of the game of the ego and drop into your pure nothingness and suddenly a revolution, a sudden transformation we have called this experience enlightenment buddhahood, awakening\nthe ego trip is a dream\nthe moment you are ready to be nothing the dream disappears and then each moment\nhas such a crystal clarity to it such immense truth in it\nthat one cannot feel cheated by existence one cannot doubt even for a single moment that life is meaningless\nlife becomes so full of meaning so brim-full, overflowing that for the first time consciousness starts growing flowers\nfor the first time the spring comes hence i have chosen the colour for my sannyas the colour of the spring in the east mind can compose many songs but they will be only compositions not creations words can be arranged\nin a certain rhythm, in a certain metre but that is only the appearance of a song that is not the way to arrive at the real song it is a plastic flower, put together it has not grown, it has not blossomed in the east we have two words for the poet one is kavi which literally means the poet another is rishi which means a seer the poet belongs to the mind 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- he composes songs, music creates dances, sculpture, painting the seer moves to a different centre of his being from the circumference to the centre and when he is at his own heart the purest spot in his being, the virgin spot where nobody can enter except oneself which is absolutely private uncontaminated by any influence from the outside there is no way to condition it no way even to touch it\nwhen one reaches\nthat purest virgin spot of one's own being then creativity erupts\nthen one does not compose a song one simply sings it, hums it it comes of its own accord then the dance happens\nyou are just a witness to it, not a doer then creativity becomes your very life then whatsoever you touch starts changing into gold you may be appreciated or not -- that is irrelevant people may understand, may not understand there is every possibility that you may not be understood you may be misunderstood\nmore often than understood because you will be speaking a totally different language and people understand the language of the mind and you will be speaking\nsome foreign tongue to them of the heart\nmind is all sound, sound signifying nothing a tale told by an idiot, much ado about nothing but mind creates much dust, so much that in the clouds of mind- dust one tends to forget everything it is very clever and efficient in creating fuss for any reason or no reason at all -- it is fussy if there is some reason -- good if there is no reason, it can always invent it is very inventive but it goes on making noise if you watch your mind\nyou can see how much noise it makes continuously, day in, day out, year in, year out it starts kicking in the mother's womb till it kicks the bucket, goes on kicking 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- but just close by it there is a small spot which is absolutely silent which makes\nno fuss, no noise and that is your heart and that is your purity\nthat is your innocence and out of that innocence\nis the experience of godliness out of that innocence the celestial music is born the Sound\nof one hand Clapping\nthere is no conflict\nhence there are no hands clapping there is no clash, otherwise it will also create noise it is absolute silence, but silence is not dead the silence has its own rhythm its own vibe\nits own music its own beauty\nand its own blessing\nhence in the east it is called anahat nad anahat nad means unstruck sound the Sound of one hand\nClapping\none hand clapping does not make any sound but it indicates something tremendously significant there is no clash, no noise but there is music, great music here is a dance in the heart the very heartbeat\nstarts having a subtle rhythm to it you cannot share it with anybody else it is unsharable\nit is a secret\nyou can experience it, you can live it but you cannot say it\nyou can show it but you cannot say it hence my sannyasins will feel embarrassed 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- everywhere in the world whenever people ask what has happened to you\nwhy have you gone crazy?\nthey will not be able to answer it is impossible to answer they have tasted something, they know the taste it is on their tongue, but it is inexpressible they have fallen into a certain dance they have enjoyed a certain silence but it is not possible to put it into words all words are inadequate\nbut who cares?\nwhen somebody asks you what has happened to you?\nsing a song, dance, laugh, roll on the ground do something\nrather than saying, show something show your bliss, show your benediction maybe, if somebody is still alive something in him may respond something may be triggered in him something may start synchronising with you maybe your laughter\ncan trigger a belly-laughter in him maybe your song can hit a new space in his being you may become a catalytic agent that's all sannyasins can do my sannyasins cannot be missionaries they can only be catalytic agents The Sound of One Hand Clapping Chapter #7\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next

cunningness, calculation mind is fear-oriented, it is a defence
mechanism it cannot trust existence, life, love it cannot trust
anything</p><p>it only doubts, it is suspicious and the suspicious, doubting one can
never be pure purity is the quality of the heart just as mind is
intrinsically cunning the heart is intrinsically innocent mind can be
knowledgeable, heart can be wise mind can be learned</p><p>the heart can be childlike, innocent and all that is great happens in
the heart not in the mind</p><p>sannyas is initiation into the ways of the heart it is getting out of
the imprisonment of the mind and entering into the freedom of the heart
it is a simple process</p><p>all that is needed is a little courage to trust a little courage to
put doubts aside a little courage to risk</p><p>and then miracles start happening and they go on happening each
moment life becomes just incredible a long, long, orgasmic ecstatic joy

stinks</span></h3><p>it cannot avoid it, its very functioning is rotten it lives on the
old, the dead, the past it feeds on corpses</p><p>hence there is no possibility of fragrance as far as mind is
concerned and all people are living in the mind hence life has become a
chaos a very muddy, confused affair it has lost all the celebration no
flowers grow anywhere</p><p>as far as human consciousness is concerned only thorns, bloody thorns
but hidden</p><p>behind the thick layers of the mind and its crap is a beautiful
source which we have brought from the beyond our heart</p><p>it is still beating</p><p>its beat goes on becoming farther and farther away because the mind
goes on accumulating junk you cannot hear its beat, you cannot taste its
joy its fragrance is ready to be released the hindrances have to be
removed and the only hindrance is the mind all other hindrances are part
of the mind greed, jealousy, desire, possessiveness, anger, ego these
are all aspects of the mind rather than fighting with each aspect
separately which is an unnecessarily long process maybe unending</p><p>the best way</p><p>is to cut the whole mind in a single blow that's what sannyas is all
about beheading yourself</p><p>and the moment you put the whole mind aside and it is only a question
of decisiveness immediately something new</p><p>which has never been felt within you starts arising a fragrance</p><p>life starts becoming a light unto itself life starts taking the
colours the rainbow colours of love festivity, music, poetry,
creativity, sensitivity the same energies which were involved

into a new dimension all that is needed on the part of my sannyasins is
to shift their energies from the head to the heart trust the heart, try
to live the heart wherever it leads go with it without any doubt,
without any fear follow the heart and you will be following true
religion follow the mind</p><p>and you will be following</p><p>christianity, hinduism, mohammedanism all untrue religions</p><p>the true religion is basically individual and the untrue is
collective mind is part of the collective and the heart is your
individual source people are living a life of curse and nobody else is
responsible for it that is the strangest thing about it they themselves
are responsible they have got caught in a pattern, a vicious circle they
go on moving in the wheel clinging tightly to the wheel and the wheel is
crushing them mind is a wheel with many spokes but exactly in the centre
of the wheel there is something unmoving unless we touch that centre
that unmoving centre of all movement we can never feel the benediction
of existence it is always there, within our reach any moment we can dive
deep into it but we cling to the wheel</p><p>and the faster it moves the more afraid we are and so we cling more
tightly we cling to our doubts</p><p>not seeing a simple fact</p><p>that a person who lives in doubts cannot be blissful doubt can only
create misery because it is negative it is darkness</p><p>it is not light</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query->Osho's books

persecution-mania it can create violence</p><p>but it cannot create bliss but still people brag about their doubting
mind they think it is something great they talk about their scepticism
they think it is something philosophical it is sheer stupidity but they
make much fuss because they have made it an investment of their life
they cling to their greed</p><p>knowing perfectly well that it is unfulfillable and when you cling to
something which is unfulfillable</p><p>you will remain miserable</p><p>wherever you are misery will haunt you you will be asking for more
and more and whenever you ask for more you will feel frustrated</p><p>because it is never coming even if it comes your demand grows the
demand grows in the same proportion so you remain as hungry, as beggarly
as ever and this is the case with everything anger, pessimism</p><p>always seeing the negative side of life there are people</p><p>if you take them to a rose bush they will count the thorns first they
will count the thorns roses don't matter; what matters is thorns and
then their fingers are bloody and they are hurting</p><p>and then they become so angry and their eyes become so antagonistic
towards the rose bush</p><p>that it becomes impossible to see the roses a thick fog of anger
surrounds them this is our doing</p><p>a sannyasin has to be aware of all this nonsense if you go to a rose
bush, dance around it look at the roses</p><p>rejoice in the roses see the miracle</p><p>amongst thousands of flowers a rose has blossomed 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--what-more-mystery-can-there-be>Osho's

more mystery can there be?</span></h3><p>jesus walking on water is nothing compared to it in fact if you walk
on water you will only look silly a rose growing in the thorns is really
a miracle and once you have seen the rose, the positive you are shifting
your gears from the mind to the heart from cunningness to innocence from
negativity to positivity and then life becomes an eternal song the
purest experience in life is that of love sex is not love, it is
biological prayer is not love, it is theological the first -- sex, which
is misunderstood by many as love</p><p>is below human consciousness it belongs to our past, it is just a
hangover the second is only a fiction -- the prayer that, too, really
belongs to our past out of fear man started praying to god in fact, out
of fear he created god god is nothing but fear personified so one is
biological</p><p>another is just religious, superstitious between the two is the
golden mean something of immense value that is love</p><p>it is more than sex and more than prayer it is the fragrance of human
consciousness it is the flowering of consciousness itself hence i put
love</p><p>as the highest expression of all that is great</p><p>jesus says god is love; i say love is god because when you say god is
love that simply means</p><p>god may have many other qualities love is only one of the qualities
of god god is important, love is only one of the aspects to me love is
god</p><p>love is the real thing</p><p>godliness is only one of the qualities of love my message is beyond

message is</span></h3><p>simply that of expanding human consciousness and love</p><p>is nothing but sharing of your consciousness with as many people as
possible not only with people, with animals, with trees with birds, with
clouds, with stars the whole emphasis is on sharing not with whom</p><p>the address is not important sharing</p><p>the sheer joy of sharing your being is love and that is the purest
phenomenon the holiest of the holy</p><p>the most sacred</p><p>and it is hidden in the very ordinariness of our lives so we are not
to go anywhere to search for it we have to dig it</p><p>now and here</p><p>and within ourselves</p><p>the heart is naturally contented it never asks for more</p><p>whatsoever is, is more than enough mind is naturally discontented
whatsoever is, is never enough more is needed hence mind lives in a
constant struggle with existence never at ease, always tense always
anxious, worried</p><p>anguish has become its very centre just the opposite is the case with
the heart there is no conflict, no struggle as each moment unfolds the
heart lives it with joy with gratitude, with immense thankfulness
because it is a gift of the whole we don't deserve it at all if next
moment i die</p><p>there is no court of appeal for it i cannot say to anybody why</p><p>why could i not exist for a few minutes more? we all know it</p><p>still we go on taking for granted whatsoever is given to us this is
one of the ugly traits of the mind it never feels grateful 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--1>Osho's

religion, the very core move from the discontented world of the mind to
the contented world of the near and small things are so blissful just a
cup of tea</p><p>just sipping the tea, savouring its taste and flavour is as great an
ecstasy</p><p>as any buddha has achieved in his samadhi there is no difference at
all the question is not</p><p>whether you are sitting underneath a tree and meditating</p><p>or sitting in your room and sipping tea the question is of the heart
if the heart is contented in the moment then whether under the tree, in
the mountains or in the room, it makes no difference the contented heart
knows the beauties of existence the mysteries of life</p><p>all the doors open for it</p><p>existence is closed for the mind open for the heart existence is
closed for the cunning open for the pure god to me is not a person</p><p>but only a presence, an experience like love, like joy, like beauty
you cannot encounter joy</p><p>you cannot meet joy and say, hello how are you? you cannot because
joy</p><p>is not something separate from you joy is an experience, so is the
case with joy so my expression for god is godliness linguistically,
gramatically, it does not look right so i go on using the word god but
whenever i use the word god i mean godliness purity is godliness</p><p>and by purity i don't mean a moral purity following the ten
commandments you become pure</p><p>that is not purity; that is sheer cunningness those ten commandments
are basically jewish it is a business proposal, it is pure business it
is arranging for the other world creating a bank balance there

so okay, we will do these things but it is only a doing</p><p>not your being</p><p>at the core of your being you remain the same following all the
commandments and the real purity is not of doing but of being one has to
be innocent in the being then who cares about the heavenly pleasures and
who cares about paradise?</p><p>then paradise is herenow</p><p>then it is not a question of tomorrow so i don't teach the purity of
so-called moral disciplines i only teach one purity</p><p>the purity of changing the gestalt from the mind to the heart
becoming more heart-full is becoming pure becoming less mind-full is
becoming more pure the moment mind is completely gone and there is only
heart -- throbbing, dancing you have arrived home</p><p>and that is the moment</p><p>the presence of godliness is felt not something outer to you but
something within your very soul a flame of your own consciousness purity
is a light</p><p>mind is always a dark night of the soul there is no dawn in it</p><p>the night continues, it is an eternal night darkness is its very
nature the heart lives always in the dawn it is always light there</p><p>so it is not a question of bringing light to the mind the question is
changing</p><p>the altitude of your existence changing the plane, the dimension if
one remains in the mind one will remain in darkness if one changes from

there and you were unnecessarily missing it it was showering on you,

to light and we are making great efforts to make this mind bigger and

bigger and bigger one-third of a human life</p><p>twenty-five years are wasted just puffing the balloon of the mind
bigger and</p><p>bigger</p><p>and it is an empty balloon, there is nothing in it nobody has ever
achieved anything in it not a single human being in the whole of history
has said, i have attained contentment through mind blissfulness through
mind</p><p>immortality through mind</p><p>truth through mind, love through mind not a single statement, without
any exception.</p><p>mind has proved utterly impotent but still we go on carrying the old,
rotten tradition of making it bigger and bigger that man is almost
crushed underneath it the mind has become mountainous and man is not

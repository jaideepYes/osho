Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- a life without love is life without life itself it is just lived at the minimum somehow lived, in fact a drag it is boredom, meaninglessness it is simply waiting for nothing to happen waiting for godot\nand godot never comes -- what comes is death the man without love is born dead lives dead, dies dead\nit is a long process of death but love brings a transformation love is like spring\nsuddenly hidden sources start flowing for the first time one feels the thrill of existence the adventure, the immense call of the unknown and a tremendous desire to plunge into the ocean of existence that's exactly what love is a longing to meet with the whole and in that very longing\nlife starts reaching higher peaks it starts becoming a living fragrance there is no other purpose\nlife itself is its own end my sannyasins have to remember it continuously because for centuries\nthe people's minds have been diverted life has been made a means to some other end and life is not a means\nit is an end unto itself\nand the moment life is an end unto itself it is nothing but pure love love is the taste of the real person the authentic person\nhis vibe, his flavour, his fragrance love brings many gifts, unaccountable gifts an unending procession of gifts these are a few of the gifts of love one becomes just\n-- only love can be just love cannot be unjust by its very nature it cannot harm, it can only help it cannot be prejudicial; it is absolutely impartial it never uses the other as a means 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- that is reducing the other into a thing into a commodity love respects\nlove has no possibility\nof ever reducing people into things they are respected as divine beings as personifications of godliness and you cannot be unjust\nwhen you think of the other as divine and the moment your life is full of love and justice\nthere is glory, there is great rejoicing in your being there is a simple law of life if you harm others\nyou cannot be happy, you cannot be blissful if you harm others\nthe harm will come back to you multiplied if you help, the same is also true whatsoever you give comes back a thousandfold so once a person starts sharing his love, his joy he is showered by existence from all nooks and corners flowers start raining on him he becomes enthroned\nhe becomes glorious there is no other glory\ncompared to the glory of love even the greatest emperor is a pauper in comparison to a lover\nhe may have all the riches of the world he may have conquered the whole world but he has missed his own heart deep down he is just darkness there is no light within him his life may be surrounded by many many pleasures but deep down there is a wound a cancerous wound\nhis love energy has not become a flower and when love energy remains unflowered it turns into a wound\nit turns into pus, it stinks hence the politicians stink, they are bound to they are the people without love the great conquerors\nfrom alexander to napoleon, to adolf hitler they all stink 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- for the simple reason that they have missed flowering their spring has not happened love is my simple message\nno other gospel is needed\nlove is enough, more than enough it is the whole alchemy of transformation mind knows no contentment\nbecause mind is without love and contentment is a by-product of love mind is logic -- logic is basically discontentment it is argument with existence, it is not agreement even if logicians agree, they only agree to disagree their fundamental approach is of disagreement mind is in a constant fight and of course, fighting\nwith the whole is doomed from the very beginning -- you cannot win\nhow can a small wave of the ocean hope to win against the ocean?\nthe very desire is simply insane and mind breeds all kinds of insanities but they all start from the seed of discontentment a sannyasin has to shift his energy from the mind to the heart from logic to love\nthe moment you are loving\nyou are starting to agree with existence that's what love is all about an agreement not reluctantly done, joyously done not unwilling done, but dancingly done with great relish and gusto as if one is coming home\nthe existence is our home\nthe very idea of struggle and fight is stupid there is no point in it i teach harmony\nbe in tune with existence\nwith trees, with the wind, with the rain, with the sun be in tune\nand wherever you find yourself disagreeing remember you are at fault existence is always right\nso whenever you are miserable you are wrong 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- drop your wrong don't try to correct existence, that cannot be done that which cannot be done should not be tried because that is a futile effort don't be american\nthe american philosophy is try it and try it and try it again i say, try it, try it, but don't try it again otherwise you will look silly twice is enough, thrice is too much and if you go on trying then you are just being stupid give it a try, perhaps a second try but then enough is enough\nthen stop trying and start enjoying struggle is not the way of love, harmony, accord.\nthe moment you are in accord with the whole life becomes a tremendous contentment so deep, so unfathomable, so immeasurable so indefinable, so inexpressible and we are all searching for it but searching in a wrong way, in the american way it can be found right now\nbut you have to put your struggle aside relax and suddenly it is there\ni know only one prayer\nthe prayer that comes as a shadow of a loving heart a by-product of love, a consequence of love it has not to be done, it happens it is not addressed to anybody it is an unaddressed thankfulness to the whole to all that is\nand remember, it is unexpressed words won't help\nwords are very small and love is vast as vast as the sky itself\nyou cannot force the sky into a word so all prayers which consist of words are man's inventions\nbut there is a prayer which does not consist of words which has never been said which will never be said\nbut which has happened many times and will go on happening many times 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- it happens when you are in total love when there is nobody holding back when you have gone completely into the whole with no conditions, with no strings attached with no demands\nwhen you have relaxed yourself surrendered yourself to the ultimate unity of things to the celestial music\nand you have just become a simple note in it no longer carrying any separatehood just a simple harmonious part of it then there is prayer\nthat prayer can only be defined as unexpressed gratefulness unsaid thankfulness\ncompassion without love is hypocrisy one can practise it, cultivate it that's what christian missionaries go on doing all over the world\nit is compassion without love of course there are motives hidden behind it because love is missing\nso some motive is bound to be there the motive is to reach heaven to attain to heavenly pleasures it is a business, it is a bargain here we sacrifice\nthere we will get more than we are sacrificing with all the interest due\nand here is only a small life and there you will attain to pleasures for infinity, for eternity it is really a lottery\ngiving just a small coin\nand then getting millions of dollars out of it it is gambling but these gamblers\nhave been praised down the ages as saints\nthey are simply business people to me compassion without love is pseudo and has been the cause\nof many mischievous deeds on the earth love has to be the beginning of real compassion when it comes out of love then there is no motive 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- then it is unmotivated and anything unmotivated has a sheer beauty when you do something\njust because you love to do it for no other reason at all nothing has to be gained out of it you may in fact lose something but you cannot gain anything still you want to do it\nbecause it is such a joy to do it then compassion is a healing force then whomsoever it touches it heals then whomsoever it comes close to it transforms so i don't say cultivate compassion i say be loving\nand compassion will come of its own accord when you find it following you of its own accord then welcome it, but never cultivate it never try to be of service to people these do-gooders are the most dangerous people in the world\nthese are the criminals\nin the name of beautiful words they are dominating humanity of course when you serve somebody you oblige him you become higher, he becomes lower you have really humiliated him but love never humiliates\nin fact it exalts\nso it is not a question of serving it is a question of living your love it has nothing to do with the other it has something to do with your innermost being you are so full of love that you want to share it just like a rain cloud\nso full of rainwater it wants to shower it is not much concerned where, on whom it will shower on the rich it will shower on the poor it will shower on the rocks it will shower on the soil it will simply shower\nunconcerned on whom it is bestowing on whom it is showering its richness in fact it is not obliging anybody on the contrary it is being obliged by everybody whosoever is receiving its showers is obliging him 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- a real man of love is continuously obliged by everybody whosoever greets his love, receives his love it is a totally different dimension it starts by being loving\nnot by being compassionate all the religions in the world have been doing just the opposite they teach you to be compassionate then you will be loving\ni say to you be loving\ncompassion comes on its own love should not be an idea it should be just pure living one should not think of love as a far away ideal that has to be achieved somewhere in the future, tomorrow\nit should be something immediate like breathing\nyou don't postpone it for tomorrow you don't say, i will breathe when i have time or when i retire\nor when i am finished with other important things breathing can wait\nbut that's what people are doing with love and love is exactly the breathing of the soul just as breathing is for the body love is for the soul\ndon't postpone it\nnot even for a single moment if there is a choice\nwhether to postpone breathing or love then postpone breathing because you will not lose much but don't postpone love\nthat is the very essential core of life each moment\nfind ways of how to breathe love and there are infinite possibilities one just has\nto look for them and they are there, they have always been there we have been avoiding\na sannyasin starts changing his valuation he changes his gestalt it is like you are reading a book 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- you jump from one word to another word and you always miss the gap between the words which is always there\nyou can change the gestalt you can start jumping from one gap to another gap leaving the words\nand then you will be surprised it is the same book\nbut the message is totally different then you can read the gita, bible, koran but you will be reading the same book the book of nothingness\nthen whether you read hebrew or latin or greek does not matter\nbecause you are reading only the intervals which are neither hebrew nor sanskrit nor greek nor latin\nwhich are simply gaps\nthe same is true about our life we have to change our gestalt we look for misery, we find it start looking for joy and you will find it we look for thorns and they are there start looking for flowers\nand they have always been there just waiting for you to look at them love should be our continuous choice find out ways and means in every situation so that you can love\neven a person who is very repulsive to you may have something that you can love in him once it happened\na man died\nhe was the worst man of the town, the most hated and the ritual of the town was that before a person can be burned somebody should speak in praise of him but there was nothing to say in praise of that man everybody was looking at each other what to say\nbecause whatsoever you say will be wrong and nobody wanted to say anything in praise of that ugly man; he has been such a torture they were all feeling relieved that at last they were finished with him but the burial could not start finally, one man stood up\nand he said, this beautiful man is dead he was beautiful 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- as far as his four other brothers are concerned remember those four who are still alive in comparison to those four he was the noblest person you can think about and the whole crowd clapped and appreciated this was a truth\nthey had completely forgotten about the four who are still alive you can always find something even the worst man\nyou just have to look for it and you can also find the worst in the best man you just have to look for it it is only a question of outlook a sannyasin has to choose all those aspects of life and people\nwhich create a response in you of love so slowly your life becomes a continuum of love from one moment to the other it starts growing deeper and deeper into love when you've reached the unfathomable you have come home\nunfathomable love is the ultimate secret of life but the journey begins now love is the most beautiful phenomenon in existence flowers are beautiful\nrainbows are beautiful stars are beautiful\nbut they are nothing compared to love because they are all material manifestations love is the manifestation of consciousness it is the flower of consciousness it is all the colours of the rainbow but its constituent factors are not material but non-material\nit is all the light of the stars, but stars die sooner or later they will go out of life continuously they are fading out love has an eternal source of light it never dies, it is immortal hence its beauty is divine to love is the only religion there is all other religions are a hindrance to love naturally, because they are competitors in the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- marketplace they are all against love\nthey know certainly that if love wins then mohammedanism, christianity, hinduism all are gone\nso they will not allow love they will cripple and paralyse love in every possible way\nthat's what they have been doing for thousands of years\nthey have poisoned the very source of love my effort here is to purify your sources of love to bring you back the gift that you had brought with you from your very childhood\nit has to be refined, purified, it has to be reclaimed once you have started living just a little bit of love and that's enough that small flame of love is enough then the whole forest of your life will be aflame love can be lived but cannot be known love can be experienced but cannot be measured love can be tasted but cannot be expressed it is indefinable\nit is the most mysterious experience in existence and the most glorious and the most exalted\nand the most ecstatic\nbut the strange calamity is that people go on looking for everything except love yes, they talk about love but it is mere talk they don't live it\nthey want love but they don't give it and when everybody wants and nobody gives how can it happen?\nlove has to be given\nand then it comes of its own accord existence is not miserly if we give and share it returns back but one should not give\nin order to get something back because that is not giving one should simply give for the sheer joy of giving and then it comes\nand it comes as a great surprise because you were not expecting you were not hoping\nyou were not waiting\nand suddenly the guest has come and he has knocked on the door 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- in india we have a very beautiful word for the guest it does not exist in any other language in india our word for the guest is atiti atiti means\none who comes without informing you if he informs you he is not a guest if he gives you a date: that i am coming on this date, by this train then he is not a guest\nbecause you are already prepared then you are going to receive him at the station and...\nthen you are ready, then it is not a surprise the guest is a guest\nonly when suddenly out of nowhere the door opens and the guest enters and for a moment you cannot believe your own eyes that moment of surprise\ncomes in the life of a sannyasin every day every moment because he is not expecting anything he is simply giving\nand each moment brings thousands of miracles and these miracles go on\nbecoming bigger and bigger life becomes a sheer celebration love is the secret of it all love is the greatest treasure the most precious benediction and it is our birthright, everybody is entitled to it it is not something that needs rare talents it is not something like painting or music or poetry love is a natural, spontaneous phenomenon to all beings\nso nobody is more endowed or less endowed as far as love is concerned existence is absolutely communistic all are equal\nbut the strange thing is that very few people\nare even aware of their treasures and the reason is that we are looking outside and love resides inside\nwe are wandering everywhere in search of it and it is just sitting at the very centre of our being 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- hence all that is needed is a simple process of returning home a one-hundred-eighty degree turn towards oneself that's what i call meditation meditation is looking in\nthe moment you look in\nthe world of love opens up and immediately you are blessed immediately all\npoverty disappears all longing, all discontent disappears immediately, instantly all that you wanted always to happen, has happened one simply starts dancing in sheer thankfulness\none cannot say anything about love or whatsoever can be said\nwill be only approximately true, not really true it will be at the most only a far away echo a reflection of the moon in the lake but not the truth of love itself the truth of love is basically experienced in silence utter silence\none has to be so silent\nthat not even a ripple of thought moves inside so silent that one has lost even hearing the sound of one's own heart beats so silent that all noise of the world within and without\nhas completely ceased\njust a pure nothingness prevails in that nothingness one hears the unheard one experiences the unimaginable that silence is not a dead silence it is very alive\nmore alive than anything you have ever known it is full of subtle music but the music does not consist of sound it is soundless music\nthe Sound of one hand Clapping\nonce that Sound of one hand 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- Clapping is heard\none has heard all the buddhas all the awakened ones all the masters\none has heard all that is worth hearing one has tasted the nectar of life so the preparation for love is preparation for a deep silence a virgin silence\nand it is simply possible\nit is not an arduous phenomenon it is not like rising towards a high mountainous peak it is far more easy\nit is totally different, just the opposite a glacier descending from the peaks of the mountains slowly\nwithout any sound without any fuss and fury\nsilently sliding towards the valley it is just like that lao tzu says, it is like\nthe river going towards the ocean he calls it the watercourse way it is easier for the river to go to the ocean\nbecause the water is always searching and seeking the lowest point it is always seeking the deepest valley it is not a search to be the first but to be the last\nand when one wants to be the last there is no problem at all when one wants to be the first then there is trouble jesus says, blessed are those who can stand last in the line up to that point i agree with him absolutely agree with him\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- blessed are those who are ready to be the last but then he adds something which drives christians nuts all over the world then he says\nblessed are those who are to be the last for theirs shall be the kingdom of god now the motive enters in\nnow it becomes a business proposal to be the last means\nif you want to be the first in the kingdom of god then be the last\nit is not the way of being the last if i have to say it i will say blessed are the last because they are the last The Sound of One Hand Clapping Chapter #8\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next

the minimum somehow lived, in fact a drag it is boredom, meaninglessness
it is simply waiting for nothing to happen waiting for godot</p><p>and godot never comes -- what comes is death the man without love is
born dead lives dead, dies dead</p><p>it is a long process of death but love brings a transformation love
is like spring</p><p>suddenly hidden sources start flowing for the first time one feels
the thrill of existence the adventure, the immense call of the unknown
and a tremendous desire to plunge into the ocean of existence that's
exactly what love is a longing to meet with the whole and in that very
longing</p><p>life starts reaching higher peaks it starts becoming a living
fragrance there is no other purpose</p><p>life itself is its own end my sannyasins have to remember it
continuously because for centuries</p><p>the people's minds have been diverted life has been made a means to
some other end and life is not a means</p><p>it is an end unto itself</p><p>and the moment life is an end unto itself it is nothing but pure love
love is the taste of the real person the authentic person</p><p>his vibe, his flavour, his fragrance love brings many gifts,
unaccountable gifts an unending procession of gifts these are a few of
the gifts of love one becomes just</p><p>-- only love can be just love cannot be unjust by its very nature it
cannot harm, it can only help it cannot be prejudicial; it is absolutely
impartial it never uses the other as a means 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-query--that-is-reducing-the-other-into-a-thing-into-a-commodity>Osho's

is reducing the other into a thing into a commodity</span></h3><p>love respects</p><p>love has no possibility</p><p>of ever reducing people into things they are respected as divine
beings as personifications of godliness and you cannot be unjust</p><p>when you think of the other as divine and the moment your life is
full of love and justice</p><p>there is glory, there is great rejoicing in your being there is a
simple law of life if you harm others</p><p>you cannot be happy, you cannot be blissful if you harm others</p><p>the harm will come back to you multiplied if you help, the same is
also true whatsoever you give comes back a thousandfold so once a person
starts sharing his love, his joy he is showered by existence from all
nooks and corners flowers start raining on him he becomes enthroned</p><p>he becomes glorious there is no other glory</p><p>compared to the glory of love even the greatest emperor is a pauper
in comparison to a lover</p><p>he may have all the riches of the world he may have conquered the
whole world but he has missed his own heart deep down he is just
darkness there is no light within him his life may be surrounded by many
many pleasures but deep down there is a wound a cancerous wound</p><p>his love energy has not become a flower and when love energy remains
unflowered it turns into a wound</p><p>it turns into pus, it stinks hence the politicians stink, they are
bound to they are the people without love the great conquerors</p><p>from alexander to napoleon, to adolf hitler they all stink

my simple message</p><p>no other gospel is needed</p><p>love is enough, more than enough it is the whole alchemy of
transformation mind knows no contentment</p><p>because mind is without love and contentment is a by-product of love
mind is logic -- logic is basically discontentment it is argument with
existence, it is not agreement even if logicians agree, they only agree
to disagree their fundamental approach is of disagreement mind is in a
constant fight and of course, fighting</p><p>with the whole is doomed from the very beginning -- you cannot
win</p><p>how can a small wave of the ocean hope to win against the ocean?</p><p>the very desire is simply insane and mind breeds all kinds of
insanities but they all start from the seed of discontentment a
sannyasin has to shift his energy from the mind to the heart from logic
to love</p><p>the moment you are loving</p><p>you are starting to agree with existence that's what love is all
about an agreement not reluctantly done, joyously done not unwilling
done, but dancingly done with great relish and gusto as if one is coming
home</p><p>the existence is our home</p><p>the very idea of struggle and fight is stupid there is no point in it
i teach harmony</p><p>be in tune with existence</p><p>with trees, with the wind, with the rain, with the sun be in tune</p><p>and wherever you find yourself disagreeing remember you are at fault
existence is always right</p><p>so whenever you are miserable you are wrong 1/08/07 Copyright Osho

your wrong</span></h3><p>don't try to correct existence, that cannot be done that which cannot
be done should not be tried because that is a futile effort don't be
american</p><p>the american philosophy is try it and try it and try it again i say,
try it, try it, but don't try it again otherwise you will look silly
twice is enough, thrice is too much and if you go on trying then you are
just being stupid give it a try, perhaps a second try but then enough is
enough</p><p>then stop trying and start enjoying struggle is not the way of love,
harmony, accord.</p><p>the moment you are in accord with the whole life becomes a tremendous
contentment so deep, so unfathomable, so immeasurable so indefinable, so
inexpressible and we are all searching for it but searching in a wrong
way, in the american way it can be found right now</p><p>but you have to put your struggle aside relax and suddenly it is
there</p><p>i know only one prayer</p><p>the prayer that comes as a shadow of a loving heart a by-product of
love, a consequence of love it has not to be done, it happens it is not
addressed to anybody it is an unaddressed thankfulness to the whole to
all that is</p><p>and remember, it is unexpressed words won't help</p><p>words are very small and love is vast as vast as the sky itself</p><p>you cannot force the sky into a word so all prayers which consist of
words are man's inventions</p><p>but there is a prayer which does not consist of words which has never
been said which will never be said</p><p>but which has happened many times and will go on happening many times

back when you have gone completely into the whole with no conditions,
with no strings attached with no demands</p><p>when you have relaxed yourself surrendered yourself to the ultimate
unity of things to the celestial music</p><p>and you have just become a simple note in it no longer carrying any
separatehood just a simple harmonious part of it then there is
prayer</p><p>that prayer can only be defined as unexpressed gratefulness unsaid
thankfulness</p><p>compassion without love is hypocrisy one can practise it, cultivate
it that's what christian missionaries go on doing all over the world</p><p>it is compassion without love of course there are motives hidden
behind it because love is missing</p><p>so some motive is bound to be there the motive is to reach heaven to
attain to heavenly pleasures it is a business, it is a bargain here we
sacrifice</p><p>there we will get more than we are sacrificing with all the interest
due</p><p>and here is only a small life and there you will attain to pleasures
for infinity, for eternity it is really a lottery</p><p>giving just a small coin</p><p>and then getting millions of dollars out of it it is gambling but
these gamblers</p><p>have been praised down the ages as saints</p><p>they are simply business people to me compassion without love is
pseudo and has been the cause</p><p>of many mischievous deeds on the earth love has to be the beginning
of real compassion when it comes out of love then there is no motive

it is unmotivated</span></h3><p>and anything unmotivated has a sheer beauty when you do something</p><p>just because you love to do it for no other reason at all nothing has
to be gained out of it you may in fact lose something but you cannot
gain anything still you want to do it</p><p>because it is such a joy to do it then compassion is a healing force
then whomsoever it touches it heals then whomsoever it comes close to it
transforms so i don't say cultivate compassion i say be loving</p><p>and compassion will come of its own accord when you find it following
you of its own accord then welcome it, but never cultivate it never try
to be of service to people these do-gooders are the most dangerous
people in the world</p><p>these are the criminals</p><p>in the name of beautiful words they are dominating humanity of course
when you serve somebody you oblige him you become higher, he becomes
lower you have really humiliated him but love never humiliates</p><p>in fact it exalts</p><p>so it is not a question of serving it is a question of living your
love it has nothing to do with the other it has something to do with
your innermost being you are so full of love that you want to share it
just like a rain cloud</p><p>so full of rainwater it wants to shower it is not much concerned
where, on whom it will shower on the rich it will shower on the poor it
will shower on the rocks it will shower on the soil it will simply
shower</p><p>unconcerned on whom it is bestowing on whom it is showering its
richness in fact it is not obliging anybody on the contrary it is being
obliged by everybody whosoever is receiving its showers is obliging him

receives his love it is a totally different dimension it starts by being
loving</p><p>not by being compassionate all the religions in the world have been
doing just the opposite they teach you to be compassionate then you will
be loving</p><p>i say to you be loving</p><p>compassion comes on its own love should not be an idea it should be
just pure living one should not think of love as a far away ideal that
has to be achieved somewhere in the future, tomorrow</p><p>it should be something immediate like breathing</p><p>you don't postpone it for tomorrow you don't say, i will breathe when
i have time or when i retire</p><p>or when i am finished with other important things breathing can
wait</p><p>but that's what people are doing with love and love is exactly the
breathing of the soul just as breathing is for the body love is for the
soul</p><p>don't postpone it</p><p>not even for a single moment if there is a choice</p><p>whether to postpone breathing or love then postpone breathing because
you will not lose much but don't postpone love</p><p>that is the very essential core of life each moment</p><p>find ways of how to breathe love and there are infinite possibilities

for misery, we find it start looking for joy and you will find it we
look for thorns and they are there start looking for flowers</p><p>and they have always been there just waiting for you to look at them
love should be our continuous choice find out ways and means in every
situation so that you can love</p><p>even a person who is very repulsive to you may have something that
you can love in him once it happened</p><p>a man died</p><p>he was the worst man of the town, the most hated and the ritual of
the town was that before a person can be burned somebody should speak in
praise of him but there was nothing to say in praise of that man
everybody was looking at each other what to say</p><p>because whatsoever you say will be wrong and nobody wanted to say
anything in praise of that ugly man; he has been such a torture they

can always find something even the worst man</p><p>you just have to look for it and you can also find the worst in the
best man you just have to look for it it is only a question of outlook a
sannyasin has to choose all those aspects of life and people</p><p>which create a response in you of love so slowly your life becomes a
continuum of love from one moment to the other it starts growing deeper

Bliss being – that will be the meaning of the name... and there is a message in it for you. I give names as messages. You will have to unfold it, live it, and by and by the name will become a reality. Right now it will only be a name, but if you work on it it will become your reality. It will not be any more a name, not just a name. This is the message – that there is no need to improve upon yourself. Drop the idea of improving, drop the idea of progressing. Drop the idea of becoming. Be! This is the greatest illusion that humanity suffers from – that one has to become something, only then can one be happy. That ‘something’ may be anything – more rich, more powerful, more spiritual, more religious, more artistic. But one has to become something, then one will be happy. So happiness is postponed and then postponing becomes your habit. When you have more money, then too the problem will be the same; you will postpone. You will say, ’How can one be happy with only this much money ? More is needed. When I have more I will be happy.\nOne can go on postponing. And life is very short; it is really short – seventy, eighty years. Out of seventy years one third is lost in sleep. Another one third is spent in just putting body and soul together – work, bread and butter. Another one third is spent in small trivia – driving from the house to the office, from the office to the house, saving, cleaning, taking a bath, eating.…\nLife is very short, and if postponing becomes your habit then there is no possibility to be blissful ever. One can easily postpone for these seventy years. And the postponing is a by-product of the idea that one has to become somebody, then one can be happy; that is utterly meaningless. One can be happy as one is, one can be happy only as one is! There is no need to wait for the second moment, for the next moment. Right now, everything is available that can make you happy. Everything that is needed to be happy is already given. It has been with you all along.\nThat is the meaning of svatma – being. Being is more significant than becoming. Becoming is the world; being is god. Becoming needs time; being is a timeless phenomenon Becoming is desiring\nand, naturally much anxiety, struggle, and frustration, and in the end, frustration . After so much struggle, one only arrives at a frustrated state of mind.\nBeing is non-desiring, no striving, no effort. One simply starts enjoying oneself and the existence that surrounds one. This is the message in your name – that you be. And Once you start feeling that one need not become anything... It is neurotic; the very idea of becoming is neurotic. One has just to be herenow and then tiny tiny moments, precious moments, win start dropping on you like a shower, a fine rain.\nSuddenly one day sitting in your room doing nothing, it is there. Suddenly you become utterly aware of the silence in the house... not a thing stirring. Or the bird there. crying... or the sun rays dancing on the floor... or the moon that is just peeping through the Window. For a moment you are in utter bliss.\nAnd the strange thing is: when bliss is, you are not. For that moment you are not, only bliss is, overwhelming bliss, for no reason at all. It has been all along; it is just that you were not alert. And you were not alert because you were striving to get something, to become something, to reach somewhere. There is nowhere to reach.We are already at home!\n[Osho suggests some groups.]\nTry these three groups... although trying is a not a very good word. And that’s why I have given you a name that means to be. Trying is never being... the effort!\nThere is a very famous zen anecdote: A zen master is standing with a handkerchief in his hand talking to his disciple. Suddenly he drops the handkerchief and asks the disciple to try to pick it up – to try to pick it up. The disciple simply picks it up and gives it to the master and the master says, ‘No, that is not the thing.’ He drops it again and he says, ‘Try to pick it up.’\nNow the disciple is a little puzzled: what is the matter? He did it again and it happened six times. The master dropped it for the seventh time and he said, ‘No, I am not satisfied. Try to pick it up again.’ Then it dawned on the disciple, he laughed – yes, he had missed.\nThe master is saying, ‘Try to pick it up,’ and the disciple says, ‘How can one try to pick it up? Either you pick it up or you don’t pick it up. Trying to pick it up is just meaningless! What can you do trying to pick it up?’\nAnd the master says, ‘Precisely! So you got it!’\nAnd in life people go on doing that – trying... trying to love. Either you love or you don’t love. Trying means somewhere in the limbo; you will be neither here nor there.\nSo, just participate in these groups and be. If striving comes, relax and remember. Just repeat your name ‘svatma’ inside. Whenever you start feeling something is coming up, stirring, and you want to try something, just remember the name ‘svatma’. Make it a mantra; just repeat two, three times inside, ‘svatma, svatma, svatma’... It means being, non-striving, non-trying. Relax into it. And something is very much possible but you will have to be in this mind: a non-striver’s mind.\n[The new sannyasin says: I believe in christianity and I have the problem about christening. I got my name through christ and in the name of god, Jesus and the holy spirit – and I want to take this name now. For me it’s difficult.]\nDon’t take it! Be a christian! If you are achieving something, if you are growing, be a christian with my blessings. If you are not achieving anything, forget all about it; then it has not happened. If christening has happened – if you have really received the name of Jesus and god – then why are you here? For what? – just to waste your time and my time? If it has happened, it has happened; then there is no need. If it has not happened, then why cling to it? Then this is another christening; this is the new christening. If one medicine has not helped, you move to another medicine.\nIt does not say anything about Christ; it is not that Christ has failed. It is only that the type of christianity that you got from your priest has failed. Maybe the priest himself did not have it. How can he give it to you? All priests are not christs. Only a christ can christen. How can the priest do it? If he had something he could have given it to you. He was just a formal priest: he gave you a formal religion. Good as far as it goes – good that you were not a communist and you were a christian – but that’s all!\nIf something has happened through it, then. I am the last person to distract you from that. If nothing has happened this is going to be your first christening. Now I am sharing something with you which can become a blossoming in you. But that is up to you, because these things cannot be given if you are not receptive. If you want to cling to your christianity, cling; nobody is interested in taking you away. But has something happened through it? If it has happened then why should you even think of sannyas? – there is no need.\nNow this is how the human mind works: you go on clinging to something which is not useful at all, which has not worked. And remember always, I am not saying that christ has failed; christ never fails! This is the only way he can succeed in you: if you become a sannyasin. Nobody will know that you are a christian, but christ will know. You are for the first time becoming a christian... not formally. I am not a christian, I am not a priest to anybody. I am not representing anybody; I only represent myself. But something is possible.…\nIf you cling to your old – you can, that’s your business! But nothing has happened and nothing is going to happen through it. You have already been a christian for many years! Why not take another chance? Why not open another door? If this door has proved a wall and you have been knocking your head against it and nothing has opened, maybe it is not a door at all! I am calling you from another door, and whatsoever door you choose, if you can get out of your misery you will be in christ.\nChrist has nothing to do with christianity. Deep down Christ has nothing to do even with Jesus – Christ is a state of consciousness. Jesus became Christ. Buddha is a christ, so is mohammed. And so you can be... but it needs risk!\nJesus was circumcised as a jew but he dared get out of the formal religion. He ventured beyond the boundaries of formal religion. He dared to be baptised by the madman, john the baptist. That’s what I am doing to you. I am a madman! Can’t you see the Jordan river around me?\nBut you have to think about it, mm? If you feel that you are losing something valuable, don’t become a sannyasin. But if you feel you are going into something valuable... then only. You can think about\nit, think for one day, mm? And then if you feel that you want to cling to your old, return the name, return the mala. And don’t feel guilty about it; there is nothing, no problem.\nWith me, everything is allowed, mm ? And take it easy! Right? Good! [Osho explains the meaning of anand purven – bliss of the East.]\nThe human mind is divided into these two hemispheres – not the human earth but the human mind. The West has its idea of happiness – that is of possessing more, of having this and that. The East has its own idea of happiness – of being more, not possessing but being more alert, more aware, more conscious... being more. The directions are different: the western approach moves outward, the eastern moves inward. The East thinks in terms of peace, silence, at-home-ness in existence, with existence. The west thinks in terms of conquering, of possessing. The western mind is basically at war, in conflict, it is aggressive.\nSo become eastern; change from the western to the eastern. It is a change from the mind to the heart, from the male attitude towards the feminine attitude, from being aggressive to being receptive.\nGod cannot be grabbed. We can only receive him: we can become the host and we can invite him. We can keep our doors open for him to come – that’s all that we can do. That’s what meditation is all about.\nThis will be a great change in you. So from this moment, think less of possessions, less of success, less of fame, less of being powerful. Think more of calm, quietude, tranquillity. And once you start thinking of the eastern approach, by and by you start relaxing. Because then there is no war, no war with anything at all – no war with nature, no war with society, no war even with yourself. Otherwise sometimes it happens that a person can even drop the world, drop possessions, start moving in, but starts fighting with himself; then the fight continues.\nThat’s what has happened to many christian saints. They are no more fighting with nature, no more fighting with man; they start fighting with themselves. They become very aggressive with themselves. They can flagellate their Own body; they can hurt their own body, they can destroy their own limbs. This is aggression turning upon itself. First they were murderers, now they have become suicides, but the basic approach of violence remains .\nSo no fight that is the message of the east. Relax, rest – all is good. Nothing has to be destroyed; everything has to be celebrated!\n[The new sannyasin says: Last year all these things you’ve said to me now were happening.I was\nvery aggressive and violent with myself.]\nRight! It has been in the past – that I can see. Now the future has to be totally different, diametrically different. It has been there in the past; that is very visible, mm? All those footprints I can see. That’s why I am giving you the name. Now you have to change radically – you have to become a new kind of man. Don’t be a german any more! Good!\n[Osho initiates someone, saying: Just feel that you are standing outside under the sky. It is sunny – the sun is shining bright; even with closed eyes you can feel the light. The light is filling you. You are open and the light in entering you; it is making you luminous.\nThat will be your constant meditation – what I told you just now. Whenever you are sitting alone, not doing anything, just feel light entering you from above. Soak it in, drink it, let it sink into your heart. Let it reach your whole body so that you disappear as a material body and you become a body of light. It will come very easy to you, and it will do miracles.\nDeva udeepta. It means illuminated by god – deva means god, udeepta means illuminated. Mm? and that is your meditation.\n[A visitor says she feels Osho’s spirit permeating her work as a movement therapist. She doesn’t want to commit herself to sannyas until she can be here for a longer time.]\nThat’s right – I understand your... Your idea is perfectly right. But there are things for which we should not wait... because one never knows! One can always wait for non-essential things because if they don’t happen nothing matters, but one should not wait for the essential. One never knows – next time you come I may not be here; next time I am here you may not be.\nSo your feeling is perfectly right... but still, one should not wait for it. Become a sannyasin!...\nThere is no need to wait and there is no need to think that you are not centred yet. Nobody is ever absolutely centered, because to be absolutely centred means to die. Something remains wavering; that is part of life. That’s why in the East we say that once a man has become absolutely centred he will not be coming again; this will be his last time... because absolute centering means death.\nNietzsche has said that when something is unripe it wants to live because it longs, desires, hopes. It wants to become perfect, it wants to reach higher plenitudes of being. But when something is ripe it wants to dieAnd he is right!\nSo if one wants a total surrender it will never be possible, because a part of the mind will always be shaking and wavering. One has to go in spite of it, and one has to take decisions. Even if one is not total, one has to take decisions, because time never waits. If you don’t decide, time is gone and then it may be too late to decide or it may be irrelevant to decide.\nThere are moments... And you are in such a space right this moment – that’s why I insisted. Otherwise I would have told you to wait. It is a rare space in which you are. It is very easy for me to connect with you right now. It is not a question of your being centred. It is more a question of your being vulnerable. You are vulnerable at this moment, open.\nFrom your side you may think that if you were more centred then you would have entered into sannyas more deeply. From your side only one thing is needed – that you should be open.and\nthat you are! Much is going to happen, and it will start growing from this moment.… Ananda means blissful, meeta means a friend – a blissful friend.\nYou have to become a blissful friend: first to yourself then to others, then to the whole. If one can be friendly to the whole, nothing else is needed. In that very friendliness is enlightenment.…\nSo become more and more friendly to your patients. to your friends, to the people you come across, to strangers. Let friendship be your flavour... and you will grow through it! Friendship will be your meditation.\nAnd now, you will not be alone – I will be with you!...\nMm? you have to share me with many people – as many as possible.\n[A sannyasin who is leaving to work as a teacher in the West says he is afraid of misguiding the children – he doesn’t know anything.]\nLove them! Feel delighted in making the aware of new things. Don’t think of yourself as a teacher. Think of yourself more as a guide who is taking them on a trip.\n... That’s what the obstacle is – to know. Be in this state of not-knowing. But naturally you have lived more in the world than they have; you certainly know a little more than they know. There is no need to become a knower, but you are a little ahead of them so you can guide them in a few things. You can make them interested in new things; you can help them explore.\nThat is the function of a teacher: to help the children to explore, to help the children so that their enquiry can become a little more systematic. It is not that you have to give them knowledge. You have to give them curiosity; you have to give them a thirst for knowing You have to create in them a great longing to explore this mysterious existence.\nThe real teacher is a mystic: he simply makes unknown dimensions available, that’s all. He simply opens doors which were closed and invites people to enter.\nSo be playful – don’t be serious – and your children will love you. Love them! Just be a help so that they can start moving on their own. Nothing to be worried about – I will be continuously helping you!\n[A sannyasin asks the meaning of the words: The honey is in the lotus flower and the bee knows it.]\nThe lotus is a symbol of ultimate flowering, mm? – that is the most beautiful flower in the east And it almost resembles energy when it comes to the ultimate centre – the seventh chakra. There happens a kind of blooming, as if a one-thousand-petalled lotus has bloomed. So, the lotus became a symbol of spiritual unfoldment, and in that unfolding of the lotus there is bliss. That bliss is what honey is, and the bee knows it. You have to become the bee: you have to become the seeker of that ultimate unfoldment in your being. The goal is to be that lotus, and the beginning is to be the bee – the seeker, the searcher. So become a bee!\nAnd the bee knows! If you really start sincerely searching you will know where it is, you don’t need to be told. We are born with that tacit understanding of where it is, we all know about it. We may not use our knowing, we may not translate our knowing into practice, we may go on neglecting, ignoring it, but we know where it is. That knowledge is a given phenomenon – you are carrying it from your very birth. Once you start really longing, once you become really thirsty, nothing can hold you, you will reach. The bee knows where the honey is.\nIn the beginning you will be the bee; in the end you will become the lotus. You are both – the beginning and the end, the alpha and the omega.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3467","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dont_just_do_something_sit_there/part5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dont_just_do_something_sit_there/>Don\'t Just Do Something, Sit There</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">5</h1><div class=post-meta>17 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3467 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dont_Just_Do_Something_Sit_There/part5.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

end, frustration . After so much struggle, one only arrives at a
frustrated state of mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Being is non-desiring, no striving, no effort. One simply starts
enjoying oneself and the existence that surrounds one. This is the
message in your name – that you be. And Once you start feeling that one
need not become anything... It is neurotic; the very idea of becoming is
neurotic. One has just to be herenow and then tiny tiny moments,
precious moments, win start dropping on you like a shower, a fine
rain.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly one day sitting in your room doing nothing, it is there.
Suddenly you become utterly aware of the silence in the house... not a
thing stirring. Or the bird there. crying... or the sun rays dancing on
the floor... or the moon that is just peeping through the Window. For a
moment you are in utter bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>And the strange thing is: when bliss is, you are not. For that moment
you are not, only bliss is, overwhelming bliss, for no reason at all. It
has been all along; it is just that you were not alert. And you were not
alert because you were striving to get something, to become something,
to reach somewhere. There is nowhere to reach.We are already at
home!</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho suggests some groups.]</p><p><br></p><p>Try these three groups... although trying is a not a very good word.
And that’s why I have given you a name that means to be. Trying is never
being... the effort!</p><p><br></p><p>There is a very famous zen anecdote: A zen master is standing with a
handkerchief in his hand talking to his disciple. Suddenly he drops the
handkerchief and asks the disciple to try to pick it up – to try to pick
it up. The disciple simply picks it up and gives it to the master and
the master says, ‘No, that is not the thing.’ He drops it again and he
says, ‘Try to pick it up.’</p><p><br></p><p>Now the disciple is a little puzzled: what is the matter? He did it
again and it happened six times. The master dropped it for the seventh
time and he said, ‘No, I am not satisfied. Try to pick it up again.’
Then it dawned on the disciple, he laughed – yes, he had missed.</p><p><br></p><p>The master is saying, ‘Try to pick it up,’ and the disciple says,
‘How can one try to pick it up? Either you pick it up or you don’t pick
it up. Trying to pick it up is just meaningless! What can you do trying
to pick it up?’</p><p><br></p><p>And the master says, ‘Precisely! So you got it!’</p><p><br></p><p>And in life people go on doing that – trying... trying to love.
Either you love or you don’t love. Trying means somewhere in the limbo;
you will be neither here nor there.</p><p><br></p><p>So, just participate in these groups and be. If striving comes, relax
and remember. Just repeat your name ‘svatma’ inside. Whenever you start
feeling something is coming up, stirring, and you want to try something,
just remember the name ‘svatma’. Make it a mantra; just repeat two,
three times inside, ‘svatma, svatma, svatma’... It means being,
non-striving, non-trying. Relax into it. And something is very much
possible but you will have to be in this mind: a non-striver’s mind.</p><p>[The new sannyasin says: I believe in christianity and I have the
problem about christening. I got my name through christ and in the name
of god, Jesus and the holy spirit – and I want to take this name now.
For me it’s difficult.]</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t take it! Be a christian! If you are achieving something, if you
are growing, be a christian with my blessings. If you are not achieving
anything, forget all about it; then it has not happened. If christening
has happened – if you have really received the name of Jesus and god –
then why are you here? For what? – just to waste your time and my time?
If it has happened, it has happened; then there is no need. If it has
not happened, then why cling to it? Then this is another christening;
this is the new christening. If one medicine has not helped, you move to
another medicine.</p><p><br></p><p>It does not say anything about Christ; it is not that Christ has
failed. It is only that the type of christianity that you got from your
priest has failed. Maybe the priest himself did not have it. How can he
give it to you? All priests are not christs. Only a christ can christen.
How can the priest do it? If he had something he could have given it to
you. He was just a formal priest: he gave you a formal religion. Good as
far as it goes – good that you were not a communist and you were a
christian – but that’s all!</p><p><br></p><p>If something has happened through it, then. I am the last person to
distract you from that. If nothing has happened this is going to be your
first christening. Now I am sharing something with you which can become
a blossoming in you. But that is up to you, because these things cannot
be given if you are not receptive. If you want to cling to your
christianity, cling; nobody is interested in taking you away. But has
something happened through it? If it has happened then why should you
even think of sannyas? – there is no need.</p><p><br></p><p>Now this is how the human mind works: you go on clinging to something
which is not useful at all, which has not worked. And remember always, I
am not saying that christ has failed; christ never fails! This is the
only way he can succeed in you: if you become a sannyasin. Nobody will
know that you are a christian, but christ will know. You are for the
first time becoming a christian... not formally. I am not a christian, I
am not a priest to anybody. I am not representing anybody; I only
represent myself. But something is possible.…</p><p><br></p><p>If you cling to your old – you can, that’s your business! But nothing
has happened and nothing is going to happen through it. You have already
been a christian for many years! Why not take another chance? Why not
open another door? If this door has proved a wall and you have been
knocking your head against it and nothing has opened, maybe it is not a
door at all! I am calling you from another door, and whatsoever door you
choose, if you can get out of your misery you will be in christ.</p><p><br></p><p>Christ has nothing to do with christianity. Deep down Christ has
nothing to do even with Jesus – Christ is a state of consciousness.
Jesus became Christ. Buddha is a christ, so is mohammed. And so you can
be... but it needs risk!</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was circumcised as a jew but he dared get out of the formal
religion. He ventured beyond the boundaries of formal religion. He dared
to be baptised by the madman, john the baptist. That’s what I am doing
to you. I am a madman! Can’t you see the Jordan river around me?</p><p><br></p><p>But you have to think about it, mm? If you feel that you are losing
something valuable, don’t become a sannyasin. But if you feel you are
going into something valuable... then only. You can think about</p><p>it, think for one day, mm? And then if you feel that you want to
cling to your old, return the name, return the mala. And don’t feel
guilty about it; there is nothing, no problem.</p><p>With me, everything is allowed, mm ? And take it easy! Right? Good!
[Osho explains the meaning of anand purven – bliss of the East.]</p><p>The human mind is divided into these two hemispheres – not the human
earth but the human mind. The West has its idea of happiness – that is
of possessing more, of having this and that. The East has its own idea
of happiness – of being more, not possessing but being more alert, more
aware, more conscious... being more. The directions are different: the
western approach moves outward, the eastern moves inward. The East
thinks in terms of peace, silence, at-home-ness in existence, with
existence. The west thinks in terms of conquering, of possessing. The
western mind is basically at war, in conflict, it is aggressive.</p><p>So become eastern; change from the western to the eastern. It is a
change from the mind to the heart, from the male attitude towards the
feminine attitude, from being aggressive to being receptive.</p><p>God cannot be grabbed. We can only receive him: we can become the
host and we can invite him. We can keep our doors open for him to come –
that’s all that we can do. That’s what meditation is all about.</p><p>This will be a great change in you. So from this moment, think less
of possessions, less of success, less of fame, less of being powerful.
Think more of calm, quietude, tranquillity. And once you start thinking
of the eastern approach, by and by you start relaxing. Because then
there is no war, no war with anything at all – no war with nature, no
war with society, no war even with yourself. Otherwise sometimes it
happens that a person can even drop the world, drop possessions, start
moving in, but starts fighting with himself; then the fight
continues.</p><p>That’s what has happened to many christian saints. They are no more
fighting with nature, no more fighting with man; they start fighting
with themselves. They become very aggressive with themselves. They can
flagellate their Own body; they can hurt their own body, they can
destroy their own limbs. This is aggression turning upon itself. First
they were murderers, now they have become suicides, but the basic
approach of violence remains .</p><p>So no fight that is the message of the east. Relax, rest – all is
good. Nothing has to be destroyed; everything has to be celebrated!</p><p>[The new sannyasin says: Last year all these things you’ve said to me
now were happening.<span class=s4></span>I was</p><p>very aggressive and violent with myself.]</p><p><br></p><p>Right! It has been in the past – that I can see. Now the future has
to be totally different, diametrically different. It has been there in
the past; that is very visible, mm? All those footprints I can see.
That’s why I am giving you the name. Now you have to change radically –
you have to become a new kind of man. Don’t be a german any more!
Good!</p><p>[Osho initiates someone, saying: Just feel that you are standing
outside under the sky. It is sunny – the sun is shining bright; even
with closed eyes you can feel the light. The light is filling you. You
are open and the light in entering you; it is making you luminous.</p><p>That will be your constant meditation – what I told you just now.
Whenever you are sitting alone, not doing anything, just feel light
entering you from above. Soak it in, drink it, let it sink into your
heart. Let it reach your whole body so that you disappear as a material
body and you become a body of light. It will come very easy to you, and
it will do miracles.</p><p>Deva udeepta. It means illuminated by god – deva means god, udeepta
means illuminated. Mm? and that is your meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>[A visitor says she feels Osho’s spirit permeating her work as a
movement therapist. She doesn’t want to commit herself to sannyas until
she can be here for a longer time.]</p><p><br></p><p>That’s right – I understand your... Your idea is perfectly right. But
there are things for which we should not wait... because one never
knows! One can always wait for non-essential things because if they
don’t happen nothing matters, but one should not wait for the essential.
One never knows – next time you come I may not be here; next time I am
here you may not be.</p><p>So your feeling is perfectly right... but still, one should not wait
for it. Become a sannyasin!...</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need to wait and there is no need to think that you are
not centred yet. Nobody is ever absolutely centered, because to be
absolutely centred means to die. Something remains wavering; that is
part of life. That’s why in the East we say that once a man has become
absolutely centred he will not be coming again; this will be his last
time... because absolute centering means death.</p><p>Nietzsche has said that when something is unripe it wants to live
because it longs, desires, hopes. It wants to become perfect, it wants
to reach higher plenitudes of being. But when something is ripe it wants
to die<span class=s4></span>And he is right!</p><p><br></p><p>So if one wants a total surrender it will never be possible, because
a part of the mind will always be shaking and wavering. One has to go in
spite of it, and one has to take decisions. Even if one is not total,
one has to take decisions, because time never waits. If you don’t
decide, time is gone and then it may be too late to decide or it may be
irrelevant to decide.</p><p><br></p><p>There are moments... And you are in such a space right this moment –
that’s why I insisted. Otherwise I would have told you to wait. It is a
rare space in which you are. It is very easy for me to connect with you
right now. It is not a question of your being centred. It is more a
question of your being vulnerable. You are vulnerable at this moment,
open.</p><p>From your side you may think that if you were more centred then you
would have entered into sannyas more deeply. From your side only one
thing is needed – that you should be open.<span class=s4></span>and</p><p>that you are! Much is going to happen, and it will start growing from
this moment.… Ananda means blissful, meeta means a friend – a blissful
friend.</p><p>You have to become a blissful friend: first to yourself then to
others, then to the whole. If one can be friendly to the whole, nothing
else is needed. In that very friendliness is enlightenment.…</p><p>So become more and more friendly to your patients. to your friends,
to the people you come across, to strangers. Let friendship be your
flavour... and you will grow through it! Friendship will be your
meditation.</p><p>And now, you will not be alone – I will be with you!...</p><p><br></p><p>Mm? you have to share me with many people – as many as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin who is leaving to work as a teacher in the West says he
is afraid of misguiding the children – he doesn’t know anything.]</p><p><br></p><p>Love them! Feel delighted in making the aware of new things. Don’t
think of yourself as a teacher. Think of yourself more as a guide who is
taking them on a trip.</p><p><br></p><p>... That’s what the obstacle is – to know. Be in this state of
not-knowing. But naturally you have lived more in the world than they
have; you certainly know a little more than they know. There is no need
to become a knower, but you are a little ahead of them so you can guide
them in a few things. You can make them interested in new things; you
can help them explore.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the function of a teacher: to help the children to explore,
to help the children so that their enquiry can become a little more
systematic. It is not that you have to give them knowledge. You have to
give them curiosity; you have to give them a thirst for knowing You have
to create in them a great longing to explore this mysterious
existence.</p><p><br></p><p>The real teacher is a mystic: he simply makes unknown dimensions
available, that’s all. He simply opens doors which were closed and
invites people to enter.</p><p><br></p><p>So be playful – don’t be serious – and your children will love you.
Love them! Just be a help so that they can start moving on their own.
Nothing to be worried about – I will be continuously helping you!</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin asks the meaning of the words: The honey is in the lotus
flower and the bee knows it.]</p><p><br></p><p>The lotus is a symbol of ultimate flowering, mm? – that is the most
beautiful flower in the east And it almost resembles energy when it
comes to the ultimate centre – the seventh chakra. There happens a kind
of blooming, as if a one-thousand-petalled lotus has bloomed. So, the
lotus became a symbol of spiritual unfoldment, and in that unfolding of
the lotus there is bliss. That bliss is what honey is, and the bee knows
it. You have to become the bee: you have to become the seeker of that
ultimate unfoldment in your being. The goal is to be that lotus, and the
beginning is to be the bee – the seeker, the searcher. So become a
bee!</p><p><br></p><p>And the bee knows! If you really start sincerely searching you will
know where it is, you don’t need to be told. We are born with that tacit
understanding of where it is, we all know about it. We may not use our
knowing, we may not translate our knowing into practice, we may go on
neglecting, ignoring it, but we know where it is. That knowledge is a
given phenomenon – you are carrying it from your very birth. Once you
start really longing, once you become really thirsty, nothing can hold
you, you will reach. The bee knows where the honey is.</p><p><br></p><p>In the beginning you will be the bee; in the end you will become the
lotus. You are both – the beginning and the end, the alpha and the
omega.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

And love is the only phenomenon that exists in time and yet is beyond time]\nOnce a gardener brought to me a summer flower – a small plant. After three, four weeks it bloomed. It was really a beautiful flower but within three, four weeks the flower was gone and the stem also died. I was a little worried. I asked the gardener, ‘What has happened?’\nHe said, ‘Don’t be worried: the stem will come many times – each summer. The root is eternal, the root is timeless. It has a perennial root, what is called ’rhizome’.’ Next summer, the stem came again and there was again a beautiful flower and again it was gone. Each summer it used to come and disappear. When it disappeared, not even a trace was left on the surface; nothing remained visible. Deeply hidden underneath the ground was the rhizome. When the time was ripe, when the season was ripe, when it was time for the rhizome to send another stem and bloom again, it would come.\nThat’s how love is: its root is like a rhizome – a root stalk which is perennial; the stem is temporal. You fall in love with one person then one day it has disappeared. It was a summer flower. And you think in those moments when love disappears that it will never come again. How can it come ? This was so unique! One feels such deep despair and one cannot believe in that sadness that love will come again, that again there will be summer and love will bloom.that only on the surface it has\ndisappeared, that there is something hidden behind, in the deepest core of your being, from where the stem will come again. One day again it is there and again one blooms.\nOne has to understand this quality of eternal love, and then rather than thinking of the flower that blooms... It is temporary, it is only for the time-being, for a few weeks; it is a honeymoon. Once you have become aware that there is a root stalk hidden underneath the ground, then you start searching for that root, that perennial root. Human love is like the summer bloom, and the love into\nwhich you are falling today – call it sannyas, initiation or you name it – the love into which you are falling today is going to take you to the rhizome. Once you have attained to that perennial root stalk, then love is no more a relationship; it becomes a state.\nThe love that exists between a master and a disciple is a state; it is not a relationship. It cannot be broken: it is something of the eternal. If it can be broken that simply means it was not there in the first place. If it is there then there is no way to break it.\n[Osho gives a name for a centre: batohi. It means a wanderer, explains Osho... one who is not searching for any goal in particular but just enjoying the wandering. It does not mean a traveller; it means a wanderer]\nAnd that is my approach towards life. One should not convert it into a travelling. When you travel, you travel with a goal in the mind. When you travel, you are not interested in travelling itself; your whole focus is on the goal and you miss all that is along the way.\nA wanderer is one who is not going anywhere in particularwho is simply enjoying the wandering.\nNorth is good, South is also good. If he reaches East, good; if he reaches West, good. Wherever he reaches he will enjoy. The whole earth is his; the whole existence is his. He is not going anywhere. He has no mind to go anywhere, so wherever he is, he is totally there.\nWhen you have a mind to go somewhere you cannot be totally in places where you don’t want to be. You have already moved in the mind, in your imagination. Physically you may exist here but in the mind you have already reached where your goal is. The mind always hovers around the goal. When there is no goal the mind has no place to abide in.\nSo in the East the wanderer has been one of the most important devices of sannyas. Buddhists call the wanderer ‘parivragika’ – one who goes from one place to another. Not that he has to go anywhere; he just enjoys being anywhere, all over the place. He never stays in one place long. He never burdens any place long. He does not make a house anywhere. The tent is his house, so he can fix it anywhere and it becomes his house. He can unfix it any moment and it is on his shoulders. He is a vagabond.\nThis wandering by and by relaxes one totally in the moment. Then you can enjoy all along, whatsoever is there – the moon, the trees, the birds, the people, strangers, unknown places. Batohi is one of the most beautiful words.…\nYou have to do much for me. Don’t take it as a responsibility – it is not!\n[A sannyasin says: During the tantra group I felt like a child and wasn’t connected at all with my sexual energywhile I was making love with my girlfriend I had an experience – that happens often\n– of my body moving by itself automatically. Osho checks his energy.]\nYou are not disconnected with your body – the problem is something else. The problem is that you want to control the body; that is creating the problem. If you want to control the body you will feel\ndisconnected. Your body has perfectly flowing energy but you have some idea deep down that you have to control it, that it has to follow you, that it has to go according to you. So when it starts moving on its own you become afraid. In your fear you want to control it, and you cannot control it because it has really good energy.\nIf it were not so energy-full you would have been able to control it. You cannot control it because it is really good energy; powerful energy is there. And when you cannot control you become frightened; you think, ‘What is going on? Am I not the master of my own house?’\nIn fact, to divide yourself from the body is the beginning of trouble. Rather than telling the body to follow you, you should follow the body. The body has its own wisdom which is far more ancient and far more perennial than what the mind knows. The mind is just a new arrival. The mind is just very very tiny; the body’s roots are very ancient. It has lived down the centuries – for millennia it has lived – and your mind is just a small thing. The part is trying to control the whole; that is creating the trouble.\nAnd that’s why sometimes you will feel impotent; in tantra you felt impotent. Whenever the mind wants to control the body, the person becomes impotent. Not that you are impotent – you have full energy – but people who want to control the body will feel a kind of impotence because they cannot control it. When you want to make love to the woman, you cannot; you feel impotent. When the body wants to make love to a woman, you don’t, because you want to remain in control. That’s how the trouble is being created by you. It is a created trouble, and because it is created it is very simple to solve it. You can just drop it and it is solved; there is no problem.\nSo three things: first, stop trying to control the body. It is perfectly good that the body is moving on its own. That’s what I am teaching you, day in, day out – to let the body possess you; don’t be a manipulator. Be a participant with the body, not a manipulator. Don’t think the body is the slave and you are the master. You are not separate from the body; the body is not separate from you. The very idea of separation is utterly wrong and creates a thousand and one troubles. You are the body; the body is you. The body is your visible part and you are the body’s invisible part. There is no need to control; there is nobody to control.\nRelax into the body, rest into the body. Next time when you are making love and the body starts moving on its own, be thrilled that your body is alive. You have not been able to kill it yet! Participate in it. Rather than trying to control it, become part of it. If the body is shaking, you go into the shaking; be the shaking!\nThe english word ‘shaking’ comes from a sanskrit root, you will be surprised to know. The sanskrit word is ‘shakti’; it means power, energy. The english word shaking comes from shakti. When you are shaken, it is energy – it is shakti. Go into it, allow it and cherish it! Cherish the dance!\nAnd the second thing: never try to impose any sexuality on the body; that is violence. When it comes on its own, that’s okay; when it doesn’t come, that too is perfectly okay.\nIn tantra you must have been trying deep down to bring sexuality. Somewhere deep down you must be trying to prove that you are potent; that’s how you became impotent. Try to prove potent and you will be impotent. In the very trying the body will reject.\nYou should have enjoyed the tantra; you should have allowed the body. If there is something to say, the body will know; if there is nothing to say the body will know. Trust the body. You missed tantra because you must have got into that male neurosis of proving something. You must have thought to prove that you are a great lover or this and that, that you have great sexual energy. Then you will just fall flat.\nSexual energy is divine energy – you cannot prove yourself through it. You can receive it when it comes, but you cannot provoke it.\n[Osho gives a name for a centre: Vikas.]\nIt means evolution. And now, meditation is the only method through which man can evolve further. Up to now the evolution was unconscious; nature has brought man to this state. Nature cannot bring man any further any more. Now man has to take his own evolution in his own hands. Now only those people will evolve who deliberately make an effort to evolve; others will remain stuck.\nUp to now the evolution was unconscious, but man has become conscious; a part, a small tiny part has become conscious. Now this is the last thing nature can do; it has done a miracle. From now onwards man has to take his own evolution in his own hands. So only if somebody consciously works will he become a buddha or a christ or a krishna. Otherwise people will remain human beings; they will not surpass humanity. Now it cannot happen unconsciously; it can only happen consciously.\n‘Vikas’ means conscious evolution. And the only method is meditation, because the only thing needed is to become more and more conscious, to dissolve the unconscious, to make one’s whole being full of light, to disperse darkness. And meditation becomes a lamp, a flame.…\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1954","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dont_just_do_something_sit_there/part8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dont_just_do_something_sit_there/>Don\'t Just Do Something, Sit There</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">8</h1><div class=post-meta>10 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1954 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dont_Just_Do_Something_Sit_There/part8.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

it. You can receive it when it comes, but you cannot provoke it.</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho gives a name for a centre: Vikas.]</p><p><br></p><p>It means evolution. And now, meditation is the only method through
which man can evolve further. Up to now the evolution was unconscious;
nature has brought man to this state. Nature cannot bring man any
further any more. Now man has to take his own evolution in his own
hands. Now only those people will evolve who deliberately make an effort
to evolve; others will remain stuck.</p><p><br></p><p>Up to now the evolution was unconscious, but man has become
conscious; a part, a small tiny part has become conscious. Now this is
the last thing nature can do; it has done a miracle. From now onwards
man has to take his own evolution in his own hands. So only if somebody
consciously works will he become a buddha or a christ or a krishna.
Otherwise people will remain human beings; they will not surpass
humanity. Now it cannot happen unconsciously; it can only happen
consciously.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Vikas’ means conscious evolution. And the only method is meditation,
because the only thing needed is to become more and more conscious, to
dissolve the unconscious, to make one’s whole being full of light, to
disperse darkness. And meditation becomes a lamp, a flame.…</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

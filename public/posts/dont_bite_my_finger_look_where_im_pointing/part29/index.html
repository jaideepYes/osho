He gives them a name: Malar – It means melody, music, rhythm.]\nAnd to be in music is to be in meditation, to become music is to be in meditation. There is a kind of music that you hear from the outside; there is also another kind of music that is heard within. When one is utterly silent and all inner turmoil and noise has disappeared, a small, still voice is heard within. It is not verbal, it is musical. It is just a rhythm, the feel of a rhythm, the feel of something dancing inside... something infinitely beautiful, absolutely exquisite, something not of the earth but of the beyond.\nSo make the centre as musical as possible – singing, dancing, praying, chanting; introduce all kinds of musical possibilities. Music is food for the soul.…\n[A sannyasin asks: Is it possible for love to exist between a man and a woman? Osho checks her energy.]\nWith this energy it is possible. It is not a question of man and woman; it is a question of energy.\nThere are levels of energy, seven levels of energy. At the first level there is simply sex, no love; love is just sugar-coating on an ugly fact. At the second level a little bit of love enters into it, but only a little bit. It can be destroyed very easily: possessiveness will destroy it, anger will destroy it, ego will destroy it; it is very delicate. At the third it becomes a little stronger, it will not be so easily destroyed. But at the fourth things start changing: then one can have a divine relationship with a human being.\nBeyond the fourth the divine becomes deeper and deeper, and slowly slowly, the sex part disappears. At the seventh level there is only pure love, all sex has disappeared. Just as at the\nfirst there is only sex, love is only a pretension, at the seventh there is only love, sex can only be a play. And the fourth is just exactly in the middle of these two: three are below it, three are above it.\nYou are at the fourth. From this point a divine love is possible. But one can fall, so one has to be very alert. Never be possessive, never be jealous. It is not love that is the problem; the problem is jealousy, that brings it down. That is the load, the heavy load, that makes it gravitate towards the earth. Drop jealousy and love has wings. It can go to the highest, to the ultimate, then the whole sky is yours.\n[A Japanese sannyasin says: I’m having a hard time adjusting to the weather and climate. I feel tired, I feel really weak.]\nIt is just a question of two, three months, and then once we have moved from this place all problems will disappear. It is a problem for everybody: heat is a problem. It is very tiring and one feels weak. I am trying to move as fast as possible (to the new commune) but there are a thousand and one obstacles.\nMm, soon it is going to happen; don’t be worried. Just pull on somehow. If you feel too much heat, you can do two things... A wet towel on the head in the day when you are sitting reading, working, translating, will be good, or a wet towel on the stomach will be of immense help. Try that, mm?\n[The sannyasin then asks: I have very deep fear; I can’t figure out what it is, but with that fear underneath every sensation, anything – joy, excitement – everything becomes like a knife to the stomach.\nOsho checks his energy.]\nMm! you must have committed hara-kiri in your past life! So the wound is still there.\nStill the wound is there. This can only be done by a Japanese, nobody else! But once you become conscious of it, it will disappear; it is a wound from your past life.\nJust knowing it, you will see it is disappearing. Anything that is in the unconscious, once it becomes conscious, starts being released. When one commits hara-kiri that wound remains for lives.\nThat’s why all the religions have been against suicide, because everything else drops with this life but the suicide, the impact of the suicide, penetrates another life. When you are committing suicide, that turmoil, that state when you are leaving your body is the last state of your mind. It naturally moves with the mind into the new body. It can create the same wound in the new body although this body has not suffered any hara-kiri. But the mind can create it; it can carry the blueprint and can create the same wound again. So it is just a wound. But it will go; just become conscious of it.\nWhenever something starts happening there just relax the stomach, don’t pull it in. If you pull it in you are helping the wound, because when somebody commits hara-kiri he has to pull his stomach in. In deep fear we all pull the stomach in and the breathing becomes shallow. When you are relaxed, unafraid, you relax the stomach; then the breathing goes deep and you don’t pull the stomach in. So just remember that much: whenever you start feeling some sensation there, relax the stomach and don’t pull it in.\nIt will disappear soon; nothing to be worried about.… I will see to it: it will go. Just don’t worry.…\nPrakriti means nature, and in that single word is my whole message. Man has gone astray by going against nature, by trying to conquer nature. The effort has been a disaster: it has destroyed the whole ecology outside and it has destroyed the inner ecology too. Science has been trying to conquer nature and the so-called religions of the past have been trying to conquer the inner nature. They have been part of the same conspiracy. Science does not like nature and the so-called religions are also against it. The outer nature has been destroyed, but even far deeper has been the damage to the inner nature.\nThere is no need to fight with nature; we are nature. There is nobody to conquer it, the whole idea is simply idiotic. How can the part conquer the whole? In trying to conquer the whole the part will simply become alienated, will lose its contact, its roots in the whole. It can exist only through the whole. The part is not separate, the part is not apart.\nTo understand this and to live it is religion to me. To me religion is not any effort to conquer anything. Religion is celebration – not victory but celebration; not conflict, but rejoicing.\nAccept nature outside and inside. In that acceptance, the transformation. That very acceptance is the transformation. One relaxes immediately, there is no need to be tense. One starts flowing with nature. Life can become a splendour if you flow with nature. If you fight, then life is hell. To me this is the meaning of hell and heaven: to be with nature is heaven, to be in conflict with nature is hell.\n[The new sannyasin says she would like to stay but she has accepted a job in the West.] Nothing to be worried about. Just drop the idea!...\nTell them you are not coming! and I take the responsibility for breaking the promise. You need not feel guilty about it.…\nMm! When your master orders you, you have to follow!...\n\u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"1293","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dont_bite_my_finger_look_where_im_pointing/part29/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dont_bite_my_finger_look_where_im_pointing/>Don\'t Bite My Finger, Look Where I\'m Pointing</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">29</h1><div class=post-meta>7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1293 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dont_Bite_My_Finger_Look_Where_Im_Pointing/part29.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part28>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p><span id=bookmark28>‌</span>CHAPTER <span class=s3>29</span></p><p><br></p><p>31 March 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyas couple who are part of a music centre in the west tell

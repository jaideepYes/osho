Meditation has nothing to do with psychotherapy, but psychotherapy can create a ground by\ngiving you a better understanding of your mind to go into meditation. It cannot lead you directly into the transcendental, but it can be a help, just the way you prepare a garden. First, you prepare the soil, but that is not the garden. And just preparing the ground, removing the weeds, the grass, any wild growth, stones, roots, still it is not the garden -- this much psychotherapy can do.\nNow you will have to put seeds, give nourishment to those seeds, care and love and protection. And slowly, slowly the bare ground will start becoming greener. One day there will be flowers and fruits.\nPsychotherapy is only a cleansing process, but it is like all cleansing processes. You have to clean your house every day; it is not as if once you have cleaned it you have cleaned it forever. Within twenty-four hours again dust gathers. You have to take a bath every day, or twice; otherwise you will start getting dirty.\nPsychotherapy is good as a cleaning method, but it does not go beyond that. And if you remain addicted to psychotherapies you will have to clean yourself again and again. You will have a better understanding of the mind but just that much is not enough to create the world of the beyond. For that, seeds of meditation, awareness, watchfulness are absolutely necessary.\nAnd once you have gone beyond the mind, psychotherapy becomes meaningless. Going beyond the mind simply means you have realized your own being. Now mind is left far behind. Going beyond the mind also means that now mind is going to function as a servant and you are the master. So whenever you need to, you can use it. Right now the situation is just the reverse. You are not the master, and the mind uses you. The mind is almost blind and it directs your life and sooner or later you are going to fall into a ditch.\nAll minds lead finally to misery, to suffering.\nMeditation is the only possibility for creating a space where blessings shower.\nI am not against psychotherapies. I am simply telling you they can be used as a foothold to jump into meditation. You can jump into meditation directly too, but you will find it a little difficult because you don't have a clean mind and a clean understanding. The mind will put every weight on you and drag you backwards. Psychotherapy is instrumental, helpful, but alone it is meaningless. I am using psychotherapy in this commune as a means towards meditation, as a help, as a preparation.\nBut in the West psychotherapy is used as an end to itself; hence psychotherapy in the West is not of much use. Unless it becomes a stepping-stone for meditation, you are moving in a circle. Every day you will have to clean. Once in a while you will have to go to a psychotherapist. People become addicted because it gives you a clean feeling, but that clean feeling remains only for a few days; again you have gathered all the rubbish.\nPsychoanalysts ordinarily give their patients two sessions per week, for years, ten years, fifteen years, and still nobody is beyond the mind. After fifteen years of psychoanalysis one simply becomes addicted to psychoanalysis; now it has become a necessity. If you don't go twice a week to a psychoanalyst you gather too much tension, too much dust, you feel too dirty, too heavy. Now you have created a new problem. Psychology rather than giving you freedom has given you new chains. It is as addictive as any alcohol or any drug. Nothing is wrong in it; in itself it is helpful and beautiful, but you should use it for something better.\nPsychoanalysis is good but the good is the enemy of the best. You should not get addicted to the good. You should use the good as a stepping-stone for the best; otherwise it turns into an enemy.\nEven psychoanalysts are very embarrassed by the fact that there is not a single man in the whole world who has been perfectly psychoanalyzed. And I am amazed at their stupidity.\nHoping that some day some man will be perfectly psychoanalyzed is exactly like hoping that some day some house will be perfectly clean and there will be no need to clean it again. It is absolutely absurd. The house will need cleaning continually, because as time passes dirt gathers.\nEven the cleanest mirror needs cleaning once in a while because dirt gathers on it, vapor gathers on it; it does not reflect clearly, it starts reflecting distortions. There will never be any man perfectly psychoanalyzed, because the process in itself is only of cleaning. Can you get your clothes cleaned forever, perfectly cleaned? They will again become ready to go into the laundry. So the people who are going continuously into psychotherapies are going into a kind of laundry, dry cleaning. It is good, but good is not enough.\nVijen, in a sense it can help if you use it as a means and you don't forget that it is\nnot all.\nIn another sense it can be a disturbance, a barrier, if you think that this is all and there is nothing else beyond it.\nThat's what is happening in the West. Psychotherapists think this is the ultimate, but they have not produced a single buddha. Even their founders, Freud or Jung or Adler are not awakened people. They are living in the same misery, in the same suffering as you are living. They are full of fear. They don't know anything about death, that it is a fiction.\nThey have not experienced their own being. They are just scratching on the surface. Mind is your surface; your being is in the center. How much you clean your surface does not matter, it is not going to lead you to the center. If you can use psychotherapy as a means it is good. If you think it is the end it is the enemy of your transcendence. It all depends on your intelligence.\nA Jew asks his rabbi, \"I have two problems. I have asked my boss a dozen times already, but he is determined to fire me at the end of the month.\"\n\"And what is the other problem?\" asks the rabbi.\n\"Ah well, my wife does not get pregnant, although she stays home and prays all day,\"\nanswers the Jew.\n\"You are doing it wrong,\" suggests the rabbi. \"Next time you stay at home to pray and send your wife to ask the boss.\"\nThree months later the happy Jew thanks the rabbi: \"Your help has worked! The boss has rehired me and my wife is pregnant!\"\nThe rabbi was certainly a great psychoanalyst and did help the poor fellow. If you need this kind of help then psychotherapy is good, but don't ask for more.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nI FEEL I CAN RELAX MORE AND MORE DEEPLY INTO MYSELF. YET, AT THE\nPERIPHERY, THERE IS AN UNASSERTIVENESS, A TREMBLING THAT CAN\nCLOUD THE BLISSFULNESS OF LIFE.\nBELOVED MASTER, DOES MY EGO NEED NOURISHMENT?\nMy God! Prem Rajya, I wonder whether you have been listening to me. Every day, morning and evening, I'm telling you to drop the ego and you are asking me a great question: \"Beloved master, does my ego need nourishment?\"\nAnd you are also saying, \"I feel I can relax more and more deeply into myself. Yet, at the periphery, there is an unassertiveness, a trembling that can cloud the blissfulness of life.\nDoes my ego need nourishment?\"\nThat will destroy whatever relaxation you have, and that will stop your growth going inwards. It will make your trembling more strong and the cloud that is covering the blissfulness of your life will become darker. Nourishment of the ego is against your authentic being; it cannot help you in any way. It can only destroy you -- destroy you as you are destined to be by your nature.\nEgo is a false mask; it will hide your original face. Don't ask for its nourishment. In fact, cut off all nourishment to it. Let it die. The death of the ego will be the beginning of your real life. The more the ego becomes strong, the less is the possibility of any realization of yourself.\nLittle Ernie was taking a walk in the park with his father, when suddenly a bee settled on a rock in front of them. Just for spite, Ernie picked up a piece of wood and smashed the bee, whereupon his father said, \"That was very cruel, Ernie, and for being cruel you will get no honey for a year.\"\nLater, Ernie deliberately stepped on a butterfly. \"And for that, young man,\" said his father, \"you will get no butter for a year.\"\nWhen they returned home, Ernie's mother was fixing the dinner. Just as they\nentered the kitchen, she saw a cockroach and immediately crushed it. Ernie looked at his father mischievously and said, \"Will you tell her, Dad, or shall I?\"\nYour question really makes me wonder how you have been listening. And perhaps this is the state of many of you. You listen to what you want to listen, not what is being said.\nYou go on continuously interpreting according to your old prejudices. Your mind is continuously interfering; it does not allow what is being said to reach to your heart. What reaches to you is something else, distorted, disfigured, maybe so distorted that it is almost the opposite of what has been said.\nOne has to learn very earnestly the art of listening. It is a difficult art, and the greatest difficulty is that everybody thinks he knows it. Just because you can hear, you think you can also listen. And these are two differing things, so different that unless you start listening you will never know the difference.\nIn the dictionaries they mean the same thing, but in actual life hearing is only because you have ears. Listening happens when just behind your ears there is no noisy mind but a silent, receptive alertness. If there is a continuously chattering mind behind the ears you only seem to listen. Then there are going to be misunderstandings.\nI myself was very shocked when I came to know that psychologists have discovered that the mind does not allow ninety-eight percent of information to reach you. It only allows two percent; ninety-eight percent is simply rejected in many different ways. Either it gives it a new color, a new meaning, or it misses it deliberately, takes it into a different context where the meaning changes. But the distortion percentage is ninety-eight percent.\nThe two percent it allows without distorting, because it agrees with its old structure.\nSo it listens only to itself. Those two percent are agreeable to the mind and so it immediately allows them in without creating obstructions, without creating arguments, doubts, misinterpretations. And language is vulnerable; each word can mean many things.\nThe mind has the capacity to choose any meaning it wants, any meaning that fits with it.\nThe art of listening is based on silence in the mind, so that the mind does not interfere, it simply allows whatever is coming to you. I am not saying you have to agree with it.\nListening does not mean that you have to agree with it, neither does it mean that you have to disagree with it. The art of listening is just pure listening, factual, undistorted. And once you have listened then comes the point whether you agree or not, but the first thing is to listen.\nIf you listen to something which is true there is no question of disagreement. If it is untrue, naturally you have to disagree with it. But your agreement or disagreement should come not from the prejudiced mind, but from the unprejudiced heart. Listening is from the heart, and hearing is from the mind, it is very superficial. And because the heart is deeper, any word that enters you first has to encounter the mind. Before it reaches the heart, the mind has done many things with it.\nA man is standing at the bar and another guy walks up to him and says, \"Are you Joe Smith?\"\nThe man says, \"Yes.\"\nThe guy says, \"Were you in Chicago a few weeks ago?\"\nJoe says, \"Just a minute,\" and takes out his notebook, turns some pages, and then says,\n\"Yes, I was in Chicago a few weeks ago.\"\nThe guy says, \"Were you in room two one three?\" Joe looks in his notebook and says, \"Yes.\"\nThe guy says, \"Did you meet Mrs. Wentworth in room two one four?\" Joe looks in his notebook and says, \"Yes.\"\nThe guy says, \"Tell me, did you make love to Mrs. Wentworth?\"\nJoe scans his notebook again and says, \"Yes, I made love to Mrs. Wentworth.\"\nThe guy says, \"Well, I'm Mr. Wentworth and I don't like it.\"\nAgain Joe looks in his notebook and says, \"You know, that's funny. I did not like it either.\"\nThis is what you call hearing. He agrees perfectly, but he hears only what he wants to hear; he understands what he wants to understand.\nAnd this is almost our everyday situation. At least here with me, you have to change this pattern, you have to be utterly silent because things are being said to you which can bring a transformation in your whole life. Here you are not learning geography or history or philosophy; here you are learning the very art, the alchemy of transformation. It is not collecting knowledge and information and becoming more knowledgeable.\nThe effort here is just the opposite: to make you less knowledgeable and more innocent, to the final point where you can say, \"I don't know anything.\" Just like a newly born child, you are pure consciousness, unscratched, unspoiled. This is the state of a sage, of a wise man. His life has a completion. From childhood he began and he moved the whole circle of life. Back he has come again to the same point that he has left in his childhood, the pure consciousness which knows nothing but reflects everything. He is capable of understanding everything exactly as it is without any distortion because he has no prejudices to distort. The state of the sage has no preconceived ideas to mix and to mess and to disfigure.\nThere is a story in the life of Lao Tzu. I have loved it very much...\nHe used to go for a morning walk deep in the mountains very early before the sunrise when it was dark and there were still stars in the sky. And he used to go to the peak from where the sunrise was the most beautiful. And he would stand there sometimes for hours, just watching the sunrise, listening to the birds, seeing the trees dancing with joy and life, opening their flowers, releasing their fragrance. And then he would come back.\nOne of his neighbors used to come with him. And he knew that Lao Tzu did not want to talk at all, because that would be a disturbance in his deep communion with nature. He had told him, \"If you don't use any words not even hello, you can come. Silently you can join me, silently you can follow me, silently we come back; there is no need to say even goodbye. Words have to be completely dropped if you want to come with me.\"\nThe neighbor loved it all. He had never thought that things can be so beautiful because he had never seen the world with such a silent peaceful mind, and with such a beautiful man who must be vibrating his silence and his blissfulness to the neighbor. Because they had been doing it for years now, the neighbor had completely forgotten that it was a strange type of morning walk.\nPeople go, and they talk and they discuss and they argue. They don't look at the trees, they don't look at the disappearing stars, they don't look at the rising sun. They are so much involved with their minds that who is there to look at all the beauty, all the joy of existence, the life again coming back from its sleep as the sun has set the day before.\nThere is everywhere celebration, in the trees, in the flowers, in the birds.\nThe man was immensely grateful to Lao Tzu that he allowed him to be with him for so many years. Lao Tzu said, \"But I had implored you not to use language. Why are you using language today after so many years?\"\nHe said, \"A problem has arisen. A guest is staying with me and he also wants to come tomorrow.\"\nLao Tzu said, \"The condition you have to tell him. He should remember that nothing has to be said on the way, then he can come.\"\nAnd the guest thought, It is a strange condition. Not a single word, not even hello, not even a goodbye when departing...!\nBut his host said, \"He is a very different kind of man and he will not relax the condition.\nSo please forget all your etiquette and mannerisms. Simply come with me, remain just like a shadow, and the experience is tremendous.\"\nThe experience was tremendous. When they reached to the highest peak from where they could see the sun rising just underneath, deep down in the valley, he forgot the condition; it was so beautiful. He had never seen such a thing, not even in a dream. He was so overwhelmed that he said to Lao Tzu, \"It is so beautiful.\"\nLao Tzu looked at the host. Suddenly the guest remembered that words are not\nto be used. Nothing was said. But as they reached home Lao Tzu told his neighbor, \"From tomorrow don't come.\"\nHe said, \"But you are punishing me too much, and I have not spoken a single word. This guest is new; he does not know you. And he has also not said much, just that it is a beautiful sunrise.\"\nLao Tzu said, \"You say it was just a little? That fellow is very talkative. Although he was not saying I could hear his chattering mind. All the way he was chattering: This is beautiful, that is beautiful, and finally, he asserted. Does he think that we can't understand beauty, that he has to tell us? I was present; you were present; he was present. We were watching the same sunrise; what was the need to say anything? No, he is too talkative.\nAnd because you brought him, and you disturbed my morning, from tomorrow nobody comes with me.\"\nThe neighbor finally persuaded him and he allowed him back after a week, but told him,\n\"Never ask if any guests can come. They don't know how to be silent; they are too new. I have never felt any difficulty with you, because not only do you not say anything, you don't think anything.\"\nThinking and speaking are not basically different. In front of a silent man, whether you think or speak it is the same. Thinking is talking with yourself inside. People don't hear it because they are engaged within themselves; they don't hear even when you talk to them.\nHow can they hear your inner chattering. But a man like Lao Tzu, in the deepest meditativeness, is able to catch your chattering almost like whispering. Even that much is a disturbance and you will not be able to listen to what is being said.\nGautam Buddha used to initiate people, and the first thing was for two years not to use language at all. Naturally, two years is a long period, and if you don't use language, slowly slowly your inner chattering also stops because it is getting no more nourishment from outside. How long can you continue playing football on your own? You need a partner. Slowly, slowly you become fed up repeating the same things, because what new information will you be getting? You have repeated the old information many times.\nI have heard...\nPeople were waiting in the waiting room of a railway station. The train was late. A man was sitting on an easy chair and everybody was interested in watching the man.\nSometimes he will giggle, sometimes he will even laugh loudly, sometimes he will throw something away. Everybody was silently watching and wondering what he is doing.\nSometimes he will make a bad face as if something bitter has come into his mouth, and sometimes he will smile so sweetly.\nFinally they could not contain themselves. The train was getting later and later and that man was weighing heavier and heavier on their minds. One of them gathered courage and went to the gentleman and asked, \"You have to forgive us, but everybody in the waiting room is interested to know what you are doing?\"\nHe said, \"Doing? I'm not doing anything. I'm just telling jokes to myself.\"\nThey said, \"That makes sense why you sometimes giggle and sometimes laugh. But why do you sometimes throw something and make a bad face?\"\nHe says, \"When I hear some old joke I throw it away.\"\nNow if you are telling jokes to yourself, all are old. From where are you getting new jokes? And how long will you deceive yourself? If for two years you have to sit silently just telling jokes to yourself, by the time two years have passed everything is old. You will be throwing with both the hands, and not a single giggle!\nAfter initiating anybody into sannyas the first thing Gautam Buddha used to say was,\n\"Now for two years be completely silent. Do not use language. If you want water then show the symbol; just be dumb. Act dumb, as if you cannot speak, so you are showing that you need water or you need food. You can point to your stomach when you are feeling hungry. Use symbols as if you cannot speak.\"\nTwo years were a long time, but after two years people were so calm and quiet,\nso radiant, so full of energy. Your constant chattering is destroying your energy. So Buddha used to remind them, \"Now your two years are over, you can use language just if it is necessary. But now you are capable of listening to what I am saying.\"\nBut many of his disciples even after two years did not use any language. The silence of being dumb... and symbols were working perfectly well. They have survived the two years just by making symbols, the very essential. You cannot talk philosophy in symbols; you cannot argue for or against God just by symbols. You can ask for water, you can ask for food, you can ask for shelter; you can say that you are feeling feverish or you are feeling cold or you are feeling too hot -- just small day-to-day things which can be counted on your ten fingers.\nOnly then do you become capable of listening; otherwise you only hear. And if you are capable of listening there is nothing left for you to do. In that silence you will be able to see without any argumentation within you what is right and what is not right. The right immediately makes you so joyful and the wrong immediately makes you sad and aloof. It is a totally different kind of differentiation than mental talk: \"This is right; this is wrong.\"\nOn what grounds can your mind say, \"This is right\"? It is your prejudice; it is your preconceived idea.\nBut the heart has no preconceived ideas. It simply sees clearly. It has eyes but no ideas. It has a clarity but no prejudices. With that clarity it can see where the door is and where the wall is. It does not have to think about it. Only a blind man thinks, Where is the door?\nOnly a blind man starts finding the door with his walking stick. You don't do that; you don't even think about the door. If you want to go out, you know, you see. There is no need of thinking, you simply go out of the door.\nIt is not because you are not thinking that first you will try to go through the wall, and then you think about where the door is. And after a logical syllogism you decide, \"This must be the door.\" This kind of process does not take place when you have eyes. Silence becomes your eyes. Silence becomes your criterion of what is right and what is not right.\nAnd the decision that comes out of silence transforms you. You don't have to do\nanything.\nMahavira, another contemporary of Gautam Buddha, a man of the same height of consciousness as Gautam Buddha, has made two divisions of people who attain to truth.\nOne division he used to call the shravakar. It means one who is capable of listening.\nShravan means listening, and shravakar means the listener, one who is capable of listening in the sense I have defined listening; one who need not do anything else, just listening will be enough.\nIf you have a master with you, a man who knows, then listening is enough. If you don't have a master with you naturally listening will not help. Then you have to be a sadhu. So these are the two categories who travel towards truth. The sadhu means the monk. He has to follow certain disciplines; he has to perform certain austerities, fasting, praying, chanting, the reading of the scriptures. He has to do a thousand and one things which for the listener are not needed.\nThe art of listening is the simplest method of transformation. Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nYOU DON'T EXIST AS A PERSON AND YET YOU ARE THE BEING THAT I LOVE MOST. YOU KNOW NOTHING AND YET I PUT ALL MY QUESTIONS AT\nYOUR FEET. YOU ARE JUST SILENCE AND YET I CAN ONLY SING YOUR\nSONG. YOU HAVE NO NAME AND YET I'M HELPLESS IN CRYING YOUR\nNAME. YOU TELL US EVERY DAY THE INEXPRESSIBLE CANNOT BE SAID, AND YET I CAN'T HELP BUT TRY AGAIN AND AGAIN.\nYOU KNOW MY GRATITUDE AND YET I CANNOT RESIST TO TOUCH\nYOUR\nFEET AND WHISPER THANK YOU, OSHO. EVEN MORE TODAY, BECAUSE\nYOU FREE ME FROM SAYING NO TO YOU. BUT NOW I HAVE A QUESTION:\nSEEING HOW PAINFUL IT IS TO SAY NO TO YOU, HOW CAN I EVER DARE TO\nASK YOU ANYTHING?\nSarjano, you are asking: \"Now I have a question: Seeing how painful it is to say no to you, how can I ever dare to ask you anything?\"\nIt is very natural to say yes when you love, just as it is natural to say no when you don't love. But there is still a deeper layer where you love so much that you can even say no.\nYour love gives you that power. Your love does not make you a slave, particularly as far as I am concerned.\nYou can say yes out of fear. Then your yes has no value. Your yes is valuable only when it comes out of your love. The value is not in your yes; the value is in your love. If you can understand this then you can understand another thing also: if your no comes out of your love, it has the same value as your yes, because the value is neither of yes nor of no; the value is of your love. Love is absolutely capable of saying yes or no, because love knows no fear.\nLove trusts so much that it can say no without any difficulty. Saying yes is very natural, but there may be times when you have to say no. But the no is coming from a loving heart without any disrespect, on the contrary, with great respect. You respect so much that you know that your no will not be taken as a disrespectful or negative attitude.\nLove gives freedom. Love is freedom.\nSo you need not be worried that you cannot ask for anything. Always remember that you are free to say yes or no to me. I am not your enslaver; I am not your jailer. Not in any sense is there a bondage between me and you. All that exists is freedom and the love that freedom brings.\nIn this freedom and loving atmosphere everything is acceptable: your yes is acceptable; your no is acceptable. And unless this is possible, your love is not deep enough.\nWhat you have said in your whole question is more a statement and very truthful, honest and sincere. There was only one question in the end that I have answered, but I would like to discuss your statement. I am not answering it because there is no question in it. I am discussing it so that it can become clear to all those who are present here. Because one day everybody has to come to this state from where Sarjano is speaking.\nHe is saying, \"You don't exist as a person, and yet you are the being that I love most.\"\nIt is not only true about me. Anybody who does not exist as a person, but only as a presence, will be loved more than anyone else. Simply because he does not exist as a person, he attracts, provokes, invites your love. His absence is a tremendously powerful magnet. His absence is not emptiness; his absence is overflowingly positive. The person is not there, but the presence is intensely there. And what is the difference between the person and the presence? -- the same difference as there is between the flower and its fragrance. The flower is a person, the fragrance is only a presence. You cannot catch hold of it, yet you can be overwhelmed by it.\nA person has boundaries, limits. And one who has limits cannot give you unlimited freedom. He himself is not unlimited. Only a person who has died as an ego and has resurrected only as a pure being, a presence, has no boundaries. Obviously he is capable of giving you freedom; in fact, he cannot give you anything else. He has no boundaries.\nHe can also give you a world without boundaries. And naturally, you will love such a presence more than you can love any person.\nA person is a very small thing.\nA presence is a vast sky full of stars.\n\"You know nothing and yet I put all my questions at your feet.\" I know nothing, it is true.\nAnd only a man who knows nothing is innocent. Knowledge corrupts because it gives you prejudices, it makes you mechanical. If you ask a question to a knowledgeable man he will not answer your question directly, he will simply repeat some dead, ready-made formula. He knows; his answer will come from his knowledge.\nMy answer will come from my innocence; hence, my answer will be a direct response to your question. A learned man cannot respond to you -- he appears to answer you, but the answer is ready-made; it is not a fresh, spontaneous response. It is a prerecorded answer; it does not pay any attention to you. The answer would have been the same even if it was asked by somebody other than Sarjano.\nBut my answer will be different to each person, even though the question is the same, because I am responding each time not only to the question, but more basically to the questioner. The questioner is the context. The question is symbolic only. I have to answer the questioner more. The question is only an excuse, so my answers will be different although your question may be the same. It creates great difficulty to so-called scholars.\nOne professor of Bhagalpur University has been doing research for his doctorate on my thoughts almost for seven years, and he becomes more and more confused. He has inquired several times, \"Which answer is right? Because for the same question you have given so many answers. You have created such trouble for the scholars who will be working on your work when you are gone.\"\nThat's the way scholars work. They never work on living people, they work on dead people. They will work on Kabir, they will work on Gautam Buddha; they will work on Raidas, Meera, whom they condemned when they were alive. Raidas was a shoemaker and in India a shoemaker is not supposed to be a saint. But what to do if a shoemaker becomes a saint? He was ignored, condemned. No brahmin could go to him to ask a question.\nKabir used to live in Varanasi, which is the Jerusalem of Hindus or the Mecca of Hindus.\nIt is their ancientmost city and perhaps it is the most ancientmost city in the world. All Hindu learned scholars belong to Varanasi. And Kabir lived in Varanasi but he was not a brahmin. In fact, by his profession he was a weaver. And weavers belong to the fourth class of the sudras, untouchables. But only by profession was he a weaver; by his birth nobody knows whether he was Hindu or Mohammedan, because their parents... certainly he was illegitimate, as people call children if they are not out of marriage.\nAccording to me there are no illegitimate children; there are only illegitimate parents.\nAnd when I say illegitimate parents I don't mean those who are not married, but those who give birth to children without any love. Marriage is a formal thing. Love is the reality, the substantial reality. Any child which is born out of a formal marriage without any love, I call those parents illegitimate.\nPerhaps Kabir was born out of a pair who were not married. Out of fear of the society they left the child on the banks of the Ganges. A Hindu monk, certainly a great sage, Ramananda, had gone to the Ganges early in the morning in darkness. And the little baby who was to become Kabir was lying down on the steps of the Ganges. And as Ramananda passed by, the little baby just took his feet in his hand. Now Ramananda could not leave the child touching the feet of the master although it was going to be a condemnation for Ramananda, as to where he got the child -- most probably it is his own child and illegitimate!\nPersons like Ramananda don't care at all about the crowd and their opinions. The child has caught his feet and he could not leave the child there, knowing perfectly well that some parents have left him. He brought the child to his monastery. He was a famous Hindu monk and had thousands of disciples and they were all against him: \"What are you doing unnecessarily taking a condemnation? Give the child to us; we will leave it there or we will leave it in some orphanage.\"\nRamananda said, \"It is not that there is any question. The child has touched my feet, and I cannot refuse anybody who is ready to surrender himself.\"\nThey said, \"You are getting into unnecessary trouble. The child knows nothing; it is just accidental. You must have been passing by and he caught hold of anything. It was not addressed specially to you, Ì am your disciple.'\"\nBut Ramananda said, \"You don't understand. I know this child, not to whom he belongs in this life, but on his hand is written Kabir.\nKabir is a Mohammedan name which means God; it is one of the names of God. In Mohammedanism there are one hundred names of God. One of those one hundred names is Kabir. So certainly the child seems to be born either out of a father who is Mohammedan or a mother who is Mohammedan or perhaps both are Mohammedan, but it does not matter.\nRamananda said, \"I can look into the past life of the child. He has been my child, my disciple before too. It was not accidental that he caught my feet. He simply reminded me,\n`Your poor disciple...'\"\nPeople said, \"You are getting into unnecessary trouble. Nobody is going to believe these stories. And you will be unnecessarily thought immoral, characterless.\"\nRamananda said, \"That doesn't matter.\"\nHe raised the child and his prediction became true. Because he said, \"One day this child will be a greater man than me. I will be remembered only because of Kabir.\"\nAnd it is true. Ramananda would have been forgotten. There have been many Ramanandas, many Hindu saints whose names have been forgotten. But Kabir proved to be such a great man that obviously while Kabir is remembered you cannot forget Ramananda.\nBut because Kabir was not a brahmin, and certainly he was illegitimate in the eyes of the society, brahmins, the higher cast people, were not even ready to go to listen to him. They heard him secondhand. They wanted to know everything about him because the people who were going to him were changing so miraculously. He was one of the highest categories of consciousnesses. The same category as Gautam Buddha or Lao Tzu or Mahavira.\nYou reminded me of him by saying, \"You know nothing and yet I put all my questions at your feet.\" Knowing that I know nothing, if you still put your questions at my feet, you are sure to find the answer. It won't come from me, it\nwill arise within your own being, out of your humbleness. Just because you have put your questions at my feet shows immense trust, an innocence. And your trust will not go unfulfilled.\n\"You are just silence and yet I can only sing your song.\" It is true. I am just silence, but I am not a dead silence, I am not the silence of a cemetery. I am the silence of the mountains, the silence of the deep forests. My silence and my song are not different. My silence is a song; it has a music of its own. It has a dance too of its own. So you are right, Sarjano.\n\"You have no name and yet I'm helpless in crying your name.\" Knowing that I have no name, if you cry my name in your helplessness you will be helped, because you are not calling me in ignorance, just believing in my name. You know perfectly well that I don't have any name. But one has to address some name -- it is arbitrary. Namelessness is the reality but you cannot point a finger towards nothingness, towards silence; you cannot pinpoint. Still it is our human weakness, we have to use names.\nSilence has no name but we have called it silence. Existence has no name but we have called it existence. Enlightenment has no name but we have given it a name. It is our human weakness and frailty. But if we are aware of the fact that we are calling the nameless, then there is no problem, any name will do.\nI told you Mohammedans have one hundred names for God. I must remind you that in fact they have only ninety-nine names. One name they have left as nameless. That is the real name. Unfortunately the language is incapable, but they have done well. They say,\n\"God has one hundred names,\" and then they give the list. The list has only ninety-nine. I have asked many Mohammedan scholars, \"How do you explain this? Is there some mistake, some error? Either the man counted wrongly or he has forgotten one name.\"\nAnd not a single Mohammedan scholar could give me the right explanation because learning is very poor.\nAnd when I said to them, \"I have my own experience. I am not a Mohammedan, but I can give you the answer: The reality is the man has done it deliberately. Whoever has written these ninety-nine names knows perfectly well that one name is missing. But that is the true name which cannot be pronounced; hence\nhe has left it. The number one hundred is given, but the name is not written. So the man was neither counting wrongly nor has he forgotten it.\"\nWhen Jews write God they never use the O in the spelling. They use G-D, because the real essence, the very center is not capable to be pronounced. They have found a beautiful way; they leave out the O. And in a sense the English O is also exactly the same as the English zero. You can take it in both the senses, that God's real name can only be zero, nothingness, what Gautam Buddha called shunyam, zero; he has exactly called it zero.\nIt is perfectly right if you know that I don't have any name and still you call my name in your helplessness; you are not committing any wrong.\n\"And yet I'm helpless in crying your name. You tell us every day the inexpressible cannot be said, and yet I can't help...\" Nobody can help. The inexpressible cannot be said, but yet every effort has to be made to say it, knowing perfectly well every effort is going to fail, but just making the effort is significant. Whether it succeeds or fails, that is secondary.\nYou make the effort knowing that it is inexpressible, yet you tried. You tried and you gave ninety-nine names, but finally you accepted your defeat that no name can be given.\nBut a number can be given at least: the number one hundred. It is beautiful that the man gave the number at least. Just as the English O in God can also be interpreted, in fact should be interpreted, as zero which is God's name. And that has been dropped because it is not possible for human lips to utter it. The number one hundred has also tremendous meaning. One meaning is that the inexpressible is perfect; one hundred is a perfect number. There have been different mystical ways but all have failed. But that failure is not something to be taken in sadness. That failure also shows that although we have not been able to express his name, we have caught hold of the nameless. We will not be able to count him but we have counted everything and only he remains uncounted; that is a way of counting.\n\"And yet I can't help but try again and again. You know my gratitude and yet I cannot resist to touch your feet and whisper Thank you, Osho.\"\nIt is true for every seeker past, present, future, that nobody can show gratitude to existence but still one has to say something. Not that that saying expresses the\nreal experience of gratitude, but at least symbolically it gives you a certain satisfaction. You cannot express it in its totality, but you can give it a symbolic name.\nIn fact what do we know, even about small things? You call a roseflower red, but what do you know about red? If it was called yellow what difference would it make?\nOne of the great philosophers of the contemporary world, G.E. Moore, has asked the question, \"What do you mean by yellow?\" And all that you can do is take him to yellow flowers, marigolds, and show him that this is yellow. And he said, \"That's what I am trying to tell you. Even a small and mundane ordinary thing like yellow is inexpressible; it can only be shown. And you ask, `What is good? What is beauty? What is God? What is consciousness?'\"\nYou don't understand that these things also can only be indicated. They can be shown. I can take your hand in my hand and show you the path. I can give you the direction where you will find consciousness. But I cannot express it; I cannot give you any explanation right now without your own experience. And if you have experience you don't need any explanation.\nSarjano, lastly you are saying, \"Even more today, because you free me from saying no to you. But now I have a question: Seeing how painful it is to say no to you, how can I ever dare to ask you anything?\"\nThere is no question, no problem at all. You can say yes to me, and you can say no to me with the same love, with the same trust, and I will understand your love. I don't care about your words. I will know your heart and I will know the depths of your being.\nYes and no are just trivia.\nSarjano, you have made people serious, and I hate seriousness; hence this joke...\nThe psychiatrist had been working with the patient, a sex maniac, for many months.\nFinally, things had reached a point where the doctor thought that only hypnosis may help the unfortunate patient. The doctor swung a pendulum in front of the man's face and said, as the hypnotists do, \"I want you to imagine that this is a big\nold clock pendulum, ticking away, and soon you will be asleep. Ding-dong sleep. Ding-dong sleep.\"\nThe patient lay still for a moment and then jumped up, shouting excitedly, \"Doctor, it works! It works! My ding-dong is asleep!\"\nOkay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.\nThe Invitation Chapter #18\nChapter title: A good laugh is the greatest prayer 30 August 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium Archive\ncode: 8708300\nShortTitle: INVITA18\nAudio: Yes Video: Yes Length: 122\nmins\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nYOU OFTEN TALK TO US ABOUT GRACE.\nIT SEEMS TO BE SUCH A BEAUTIFUL WORD BUT MY UNDERSTANDING OF\nITS MEANING FEELS LIMITED. I KNOW THAT IT IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE.\nCOULD YOU SPEAK SOME MORE ABOUT IT?\nDeva Anupo, grace is one of the great mysteries of life. It is not something physical, not psychological but something spiritual. It is not within your power to create it. Any created grace will be false, phony.\nGrace comes as a flowering of your being.\nThe moment your meditation reaches to the deepest core, to the very center of the cyclone, a tremendous silence, peace and blissfulness arise within you. Grace is the total effect of all these qualities: silence, peace, love, compassion, blissfulness, ecstasy. When these things arise in you, their flame, their fire starts radiating from your physical body.\nThey are so much they start overflowing. That overflowing of your inner ecstasy is what can be defined as grace.\nSo it is possible a man or a woman may not be beautiful physically, but when grace arises their physical beauty or their physical absence of beauty is completely changed.\nWhatever their physique is, is overwhelmed by something inner which is far more powerful.\nIt is just like a lamp: the flame is inside; what you see outside the glass of the lamp is the radiation. The glass may be beautiful; the glass may not be very beautiful. The glass may be made of crystal; the glass may be made in India. Once the inner flame is lit you don't see the glass, you see the light. When the\ninner flame is not lit you will see the glass because there is nothing else to see. Then you will differentiate between a beautiful man and an ugly man, a beautiful woman or a homely woman. Just to avoid the word ùgly'\nthey have found a beautiful word, `homely'.\nBut these distinctions remain only if the inner light is still dormant. Once the inner light comes radiating through the body, you don't see the body, you see a beautiful radiance, a beautiful aura surrounding the person. That is grace.\nGrace transforms your physical body completely, because nobody can see now exactly what your physical body is. The grace is so stunning, every gesture becomes so beautiful.\nYour eyes radiate a totally new silence. They open to such great depths that they become almost unfathomable. Your words are not just language, something more is added to them. A fragrance, a beauty, a music, even your prose sounds like poetry. Ordinary words start having an extraordinary effect because your inner experience gives them authority.\nBefore, they were empty, just used cartridges, they had nothing in them. Now they are still the same words; the container is the same, but the content is a new addition to it.\nNow the content radiates through the words, and you can see it in many ways.\nGautam Buddha was born on the boundary line of India and Nepal. Now Nepalese are not known for much beauty. They are part of the Mongolian race. Their size is small, their faces don't show the beauty that you will find in Kashmir. But Gautam Buddha's statues are in a way not factual.\nI don't believe that such a beautiful man was born on the border of India and Nepal. I have been over the whole territory of Nepal and I have never come across anything resembling this beauty. Perhaps Gautam Buddha was also just an ordinary Nepalese, but why have the statues been made so beautiful? The artists, the sculptors were not seeing only the physical frame of Gautam Buddha, they were also seeing a tremendously powerful aura around him that was making him so beautiful. And it would have been wrong to make his statues as he would have looked before enlightenment. So those statues are all made after his enlightenment.\nAlmost the same has happened with Jesus. There has been an inscription found in the rocks near Galilee that describes Jesus Christ as an ugly man, extraordinarily ugly. If you had seen him he was repulsive. His height in that inscription is only four feet five inches and on top of it all, he is described as a hunchback. Now you cannot call such a man beautiful. But all the statues and the descriptions by the disciples in the gospels do not mention that he was a pygmy, four feet five inches high, that he was ugly and repulsive, that he was a hunchback. They describe him as poetically, as aesthetically as possible.\nAnd I am absolutely certain that they are not making it up. It is not their desire to present Jesus Christ their master to the world as beautiful. They have seen his beauty, but that beauty is not the ordinary beauty; that beauty is of grace.\nFrom the other side also you can see that you can sometimes find very beautiful people, physically -- if you look they are tremendously beautiful -- but if you are living close enough to them you will find their ugliness starts coming out of their physical structure.\nTheir physical structure may be like Cleopatra, but Cleopatra to me was not a beautiful woman. She may have had the form of a beautiful body but her intentions and her state of consciousness were very ugly. She cannot have any grace; she was selling her body to anybody, just to remain the queen of Egypt. She was not using the army to fight, she was using her own body. And great generals like Anthony were caught into her trap. She was using her beauty for ugly ends. She could not have grace.\nSo it is possible that a man or a woman may be physically beautiful, but if his inner being is full of darkness that darkness will show. There is no way for her to cover that darkness by any kind of makeup. In ordinary photographs she will look beautiful. But in Russia one scientist photographer, Kirlian, has developed very sensitive films that also take the photograph of your aura. They not only take your physical frame, but the light that surrounds you, that surrounds every living being, even the trees.\nEven the leaves have an aura of their own. And that aura makes such a difference. If a man has grace he will have a tremendously beautiful aura, so stunning to the eyes that you will forget about his physical body whether it was beautiful or not.\nChristians have not been able to explain the inscription and the discrepancy with the gospels because they don't seem to understand the law of grace. Kirlian is the first man as far as science is concerned who has changed the whole approach. He takes photographs of the aura; his photographs are not only of you, but the subtle light that is radiating from you. There are people who have almost no aura. Their bodies may be beautiful but their personalities will be ugly. Their intentions and ambitions and their desires will be of a very low character.\nKirlian has photographed people -- simple people, innocent people, gardeners, farmers, fishermen -- with no desire to become the president of a country, no desire to become a prime minister, not even in dreams. It is enough for them if they can survive. They have nothing, but still in the evening they will play on their flutes, they will dance, they will sing. They have beautiful auras in the photographs of Kirlian. He has opened doors of a new dimension which has not been much taken care of because it is of no use for warmongers.\nAs your death approaches your aura starts shrinking. It means your life is gathering itself at the center from where it can leave condensed -- the way you close your shop.\nHe has been puzzled by many things. For example: you have five fingers on the hand and even if one finger is cut off in an accident, in a Kirlian photograph there are still five fingers. The one that is no longer there still shows its aura; the aura is still there even though the physical part is gone. There will be a difference, because the physical fingers which are still there will show a substance in the middle of the aura. But that one finger which is missing will show simply a photograph of the aura; there will be no inner substance. It is nonsubstantial, but still the aura is there.\nWorking deeply on it, he has given such a great contribution to medical science, but nobody seems to use it. No government is interested in life; all governments are in the service of death. Seventy-five percent of national incomes are wasted on the armies and arms. People are living only on twenty-five percent of all income.\nJust the other day I was reading a calculation of a scientist who says this is the highest peak of production in the world ever. We can feed more people than there are on the earth. There is no need for anybody to die through starvation. Science has provided every possible technology, but no politician, no political\nparty is interested in it; no government is interested in it. Their interest seems to be very insane.\nIf it was in my power, I would put all the presidents and all the prime ministers into madhouses. That is the right place where they belong. They are sick people; in fact, only a sick psychology can be ambitious. A healthy psychology is not ambitious -- you are happy as you are, so there is no need for you to become a president of the country. Then will you be happy? No president is happy, because happiness has nothing to do with your post, with your money, with your power. It has something to do with your inner change, inner transformation.\nKirlian has found that six months before a person is going to die his aura starts shrinking.\nIf care is taken, that man can avoid death for a few more years. In the same way he has found that before a disease shows itself on the body, six months before, he can guarantee that his disease is going to come, although medically there is no way to check on him.\nThe only way is when the disease comes. Before the disease happens a different kind of darkness starts to appear on that part. And different diseases have different kinds of colors.\nIf Kirlian becomes part of the authoritative medical world there is no need for people first to fall sick and then to be cured. Their disease can be prevented even before they have become aware of it. Six months is enough time to cure it and to check by Kirlian photography whether it is curing or not.\nIn the East for centuries there has been the idea that six months before your death, you stop seeing the tip of your nose because your eyes start turning upwards. A dead man's eyes are turned completely upwards; you can only see the white. That's why in every country, immediately a dead man's eyes are closed, so nobody else becomes afraid; nobody gets an unnecessarily fearful impression. Because if you meet a man with completely white eyes, no black, you are going to freak out. Perhaps you may get paralyzed then and there and fall down.\nBut it takes six months for the eyes slowly to turn up. Because they are turning up, the person cannot see the tip of his own nose. What Kirlian is saying has confirmed that old proverb to be absolutely right, that the time is six months.\nAnd it is not only true about men, but about leaves, about birds, about animals. And on leaves, his work is tremendous.\nOne of my sannyasins sent me a thesis just a few days ago. Listening to me he became interested and he worked a whole doctoral thesis on the auras of the leaves. Before a leaf starts dying you cannot see: it is still green; it is still alive. There is no way to say that it is going to die soon, fall and disappear. But through Kirlian photography other leaves which are going to live show a bigger aura, and the leaf that is going to die within six months'\ntime starts showing a smaller aura. The day it will die it will not show any aura, as if the whole light of life has become condensed inside. Now it does not radiate. It is ready to leave this form of life for another form.\nBut man can be immensely helped. If Kirlian photography is used on a wider scale there is no need of so many hospitals, so many doctors; there is no need of so much surgery, so many medicines. And this is the problem: It is the establishment which is preventing Kirlian photography from becoming part of medical science because it will make many surgeons, almost all surgeons obsolete, unemployed. It will throw all the doctors on to the streets. All the great manufacturers of medicine will be out of business and bankrupt.\nThese are the problems because the establishment goes on preventing. Nobody thinks of man as such; everybody thinks about his own interest, money, power, investment. There are many inventions lying down in government warehouses. Governments purchase them, and then don't bring them onto the market, because the people who are supporting those governments with money will be affected.\nA few days ago I told you about one Japanese scientist who has been in Hiroshima for one year. He risked his life. He allowed himself to be open to the radiation that has still there. But it is lessening every day; the quantity is smaller, but the radiation is there. And his thesis was saying that radiation from atomic explosions or nuclear weapons can be used for creative purposes. The first immense experience was that although he is sixty-five and has been living one year in Hiroshima -- ordinarily it was expected that he would die of radiation -- now he looks nearabout the age of forty-five. He is sixty-five. He has become younger, he has lost twenty years, and he has become stronger.\nHe has created a few things, and because I have talked about him -- he must\nhave heard my tape or seen the video; perhaps I am the only man who has taken an interest in him.\nHe is coming on the tenth of September. And he has sent me nearabout twenty thousand dollars' worth of inventions that he has made... a belt with uranium inside it which radiates in very minute doses.… And he has been experimenting that if you keep that belt on your body for one year it will give you tremendous energy, youth, long life; many diseases that you would have suffered from, now you will not.\nHe has also sent a small soap-like thing. That too is covered... You have to keep it in your bathtub and within ten to twenty minutes the bathtub starts almost functioning as a hot springwater. It becomes hot, and just resting in that water is enough to keep you healthy and there is no question of you developing any diseases.\nHe has also sent a small bottle of which you have to take just two drops in water. For ten minutes it keeps the water radiating and after ten minutes it changes the whole quality of the water. It becomes sweeter, tasteful and immensely energy- giving.\nOne of the most significant war material producers in America is Lockheed. He has informed me that they wanted the sole copyright of the belt and all that he has invented.\nWhatsoever price he wants Lockheed was ready to offer him, but he refused. And he did well because Lockheed would have used them for destructive purposes. They would not have come on to the market for ordinary people.\nWith modern science this has become a problem that any invention, any discovery needs so much money and so much mechanism that only governments or very big firms like Lockheed or IBM or people like these can afford to produce them. A scientist alone cannot work; he does not have the right instruments which are too costly.\nBut he was surprised that at least there is one man who supports him. I have proposed that all the scientists of the world should make a world academy of scientists without any question of nation or race. And they will make it their fundamental constitution that they will function only for peace purposes. They will function only to help man live longer, live better, live more peacefully, live\nmore beautifully; live without disease, without old age, live more intelligently. They are not going to work for any government, communist or capitalist, Russian or American, to destroy this planet.\nThe same has been the case with Kirlian. His discovery is now almost fifty years old, but no government, no medical institution has given much attention to him. And he has given you one of the great secrets. He can prevent all kinds of diseases happening.\nThe grace is your aura, and as your inner being becomes more silent your aura becomes more radiant. And just as Kirlian's photography has been able to catch the aura which your ordinary eyes cannot see, a disciple in love and trust starts seeing things which an ordinary observer, outsider, will not be able to see. He starts seeing a grace; he starts hearing the music. He starts feeling a certain fragrance arising from the man, who is centered in his being, who is no longer a personality but has become innocent individuality; whose connection is no longer with the society but existence itself.\nHis life is of love; he is love. That radiance of love and peace and silence is all part of his grace. That's why I said the word `grace' has tremendous meaning because all that meditation gives you can be put together in one word, and that is\n`grace'.\nBut don't create a desire for it; don't long for it. It comes if your meditation goes deep.\nYou cannot do anything with grace directly, you can only wait. Your waiting has to become so deep, so trustful, that grace will come when the time comes. Just as the trees go on waiting for the spring -- when it comes, it comes. They are not running after spring; they are not making any speed. They are not creating any action movement: \"Why does spring come only once a year... why not twice, and why does it not remain always?\" The whole world is silently waiting. Except man there is no impatience anywhere.\nImpatience makes you ugly.\nImpatience is a disturbance in your meditation. Learn to wait. Be patient and trust that existence will give you whatever you are ready for. All that you have to do is to go on deeper in meditation, beyond mind into silence. No thoughts, no emotions, no moods, just a silent watchfulness and waiting for whatever\nexistence finds you ready for.\nGrace comes, but it comes without a whisper. You suddenly find it. You feel it within.\nYou feel it in your movements; you feel it in your sleep; you feel it in your speech --\neverywhere you are engulfed. But the only thing that is needed on your part is a deep waitfulness. Meditation will create watchfulness and you have to learn the art of waiting.\nPhilosophical Phyllis said she has learned three discouraging things about men. One, they go to war and kill each other when, if only they would be patient, they would die a natural death. Two, they climb trees and knock down apples when, if only they would be patient, the apples would fall to the ground. Three, they pursue women when, if only they would be patient, women would pursue them.\nOne has to learn the art of waiting and then millions of things will happen to you which never happen to impatient people.\nA man fell out of a tenth-storey window. He's lying on the ground with a big crowd around him. A cop walks over and says, \"What happened?\"\nThe guy says, \"I don't know, I just got here.\"\nYou have also just got here. Be a little patient, then you will start experiencing things.\nIn a school in one of Chicago's poorer districts, a questionnaire was sent home with a girl pupil requesting information regarding the number of brothers and sisters, her father's occupation, et cetera.\nThe next day she returned with a scrap of paper on which was written the following: There are eighteen children in my family. My father can also do plumbing and carpentry work.\nJust wait. People are engaged so much. Now think of that man: eighteen children and still he can do plumbing and carpentry work.\nGive a little time to yourself and in the end you will find that is the only time you have really lived. Even if you can just give one hour out of twenty-four hours to yourself, to your meditation, to your silence -- just being, not doing anything, just waiting and learning to wait. In the end of your life you will be surprised that your twenty-three hours have gone to waste. Only that one hour, whatever you have gained in that one hour is still with you and is going with you; even death cannot take it away.\nJust one hour can give you immense peace, silence, blissfulness, and slowly, slowly the aura of grace will arise around you.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nCAN YOU TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT ACCEPTANCE?\nChintan, I understand your question.…\nChintan is on the verge of death. The doctors have told him that he cannot survive more than two months, and almost one month has passed. He had inquired of me when the doctors had said he has some canceric growth which was not operable, and was growing fast. Naturally, he was shocked. A young man who has not seen life yet, has not yet lived, just in the middle... naturally he was very shocked.\nHe wrote to me and I told him, \"There is no need to be shocked. You are fortunate because you know the exact time when your life will be finished. Others are not so fortunate; they don't know. Their life may be terminated tomorrow. Because you know exactly that within two months you are going to die, live these two months as intensely and as joyfully and as meditatively as possible. You cannot postpone. Others can postpone because they are not aware when they are going to die. You are in a good situation because you cannot postpone. You have to do everything now.\"\nHe understood and he has been very happy, very joyous, meditating, dancing, singing.\nAnd his friends have written to me, \"We could not believe such a change. His doctors are in wonder; they have never seen anybody taking his death so\nbeautifully, so lightly.\"\nHis question needed this context for you to understand, when he says, \"Can you talk a bit more about acceptance?\"\nHuman languages are very poor. The word àcceptance' has a hidden reluctance. You may not have looked into the word, but when you say, \"accept it,\" there is a hidden reluctance, a kind of compulsoriness, because there is nothing else to do. So why make fuss a about it -- accept it.\nThis kind of acceptance is not true and authentic. I would say, enjoy it. Unless your acceptance is enjoyment, unless your acceptance is wholehearted -- without any reluctance, not out of any compulsion, not out of a particular situation but out of your understanding...\nAcceptance becomes a beautiful experience if it is at the same time enjoyment. You are not accepting under the pressure of circumstances; you are accepting on your own accord, with joy, with a deep welcome. Then only you understand what acceptance can do to your being. In a single moment it can change you, transform you from an ordinary human being into an awakened human being.\nBut don't accept reluctantly. That is deceiving yourself because deep down you don't want to accept. Just after two months you are going to die? And naturally, when somebody said, accept it, what else to do? There is nothing. The doctors are doing the chemotherapy -- they are doing everything that is possible. But they know that nothing is going to help; the cancer has gone beyond the limits of their cure.\nSeeing the situation you can accept it, but there will be a negativity inside you. You are accepting because nothing else can be done. If there was some possibility to try you would not accept it. I don't call this authentic acceptance. Authentic acceptance has no negative tone in it, no reluctance, no resistance, no compulsiveness. It is not because of the pressure of things and situations and our helplessness. Don't accept out of helplessness; accept out of your strength.\nTwo months are so much to live. One can live as intensely and totally in one second as people live in their whole life. But their living is very thin, spread all over a long time.\nThat does not mean that they are the fortunate ones, because authentic living\nneeds great intensity and great totality, not a thin layer. A lukewarm survival is not living. But if you know that the next moment you are going to die you will drop everything that you were involved in, and the only priority will be to know yourself.\nBefore death comes at least be aware who you are. You don't have time to postpone.\nIt happened that one man used to come to a mystic Eknath for many years. He was a devotee but there was a doubt in his mind that was continuously pinching him. And because there were always many disciples he could not ask. So one day he came very early, before sunrise. Eknath was just coming out of the river. He had taken a bath before his morning meditation in the temple. He reached Eknath and said, \"Forgive me for disturbing you at this time, but I have been carrying a question my whole life.\" And he was a young man, healthy, strong; he said, \"And I cannot dissolve it, it continues. It is a disturbance between me and you.\"\nEknath said, \"What is the problem?\"\nHe said, \"The problem is that I have seen you for many years, but I have never seen you sad. I have never seen you angry, I have never seen you jealous; I have never seen you in any negative state of mind. You are always smiling and always joyous and relaxed as if there is no worry in the world, no problem in the world. You don't seem to be concerned even about death. You take it so lightly.\n\"And the problem is that a doubt arises in me whether you are an actor or you are really enlightened? One can manage to act smiling, always showing joyousness, taking everything lightly, never seriously. Is it just a discipline? Have you trained yourself for it? Or is it something that has happened to you -- it is not your doing but a natural, spontaneous understanding that has arisen out of your meditations? That question has been bothering me, because one man can manage to pretend. You see actors in films and you know they are the most miserable lot in the world, but in the film they look so joyous, so happy, so loving, so peaceful, so courageous. If this is possible to do in a film or in a drama, then why is it not possible to do in real life? You need just a little control not to show your real feelings but always to go on acting.\"\nEknath said, \"Wait a minute. Before I answer your question I should not forget\nsomething that I wanted to tell you. I have been forgetting for three days, and it is important; so first I will tell you that thing and then I will answer your question. Just three or four days ago I happened to look at your hand, and I was very shocked. Your lifeline is finished; just such a small fraction has remained so that you may be able to live seven days at the most.\nOn the seventh day as the sun will be setting you will be dying. This I have been forgetting and this too is as important as your question. Now we can discuss your question.\"\nThe man stood up. He said, \"I don't have any question and I don't have any time to discuss. If death is coming within seven days why should I worry whether you are real or unreal. That is your business; it is not my problem.\"\nThe man started going down the steps. There were many steps to the temple, and Eknath watched him. Just five minutes ago he had come so strong, so young, and now he was going just like an old man, wobbling, taking the support of the railing that he had never taken before, afraid to fall. And when he reached home he simply went to bed directly, even though it was not the time, it was morning -\n- he had just got up from the bed. He collected the whole family and told them what Eknath had said.\nIt was inconceivable that Eknath will lie; there is no point in lying. So there was crying and weeping, and that man stopped eating. What is the point now when you are not going to live?\nBut a strange thing started happening as he became settled with the idea that death is coming and nothing can be done. \"Why not use this time for the meditation that I have been postponing for many years? Eknath goes on saying every day to meditate, put your energy into discovering yourself, and I have been postponing it, because what is the hurry? I am a young man and these things, meditation and knowing yourself belong to the old people when they have nothing else to do. Anyway they are out of work, retired. That is the right time to meditate and find out who you are. Right now you have to find out many other things -- money, power, prestige, respectability. This is not the time to waste in finding yourself. That you can do at any moment when you will not be of any use in life, and life will reject you by retiring you.\"\nIt is strange that everywhere when people are retired, their colleagues gather\ntogether just to say goodbye to them, and they always give them a pocket watch. That I cannot believe... what is the idea? But now I know. They give them a pocket watch as, \"Not much time is left to remind you, but now, do the essential things that you have been postponing.\"\nThe man lay down, started watching his mind for the first time and became utterly silent within two or three days. But the whole family and other relatives and friends from far away arrived. They were even more disturbed. Death is coming; that is a shock. And what has happened to this man? He does not open his eyes; he does not eat; he does not take any interest. This was a time to meet the family, the friends, because who knows when you will ever meet these people again; there is not much chance.\nBut he is not interested in anything. He did not even allow them to call a physician. By the fourth day they could not believe that he was looking so beautiful, so graceful, so silent. His whole bedroom almost had the same quality which exists around a man of silence or which exists in a living temple, where not only statues are, but some living master is also present.\nPeople came with great words prepared, dialogues which one needs to say, because it is very embarrassing to come to a man who is going to die. What to say to him? You cannot talk about movies, you cannot talk about politics, you cannot talk about football games, you cannot talk about boxing. What is there to talk about? It is very embarrassing if somebody is dying and you have to leave. Then one prepares a dialogue to console him,\n\"Don't be worried; everybody dies. It is not that it is happening only to you. And then there is God: you have been a virtuous man, and your heaven is absolutely guaranteed.\"\nOne has to prepare things like that because now the worldly things that one gossips with each other are of no point. But as they entered, even this dialogue was not possible, the man was so silent. On the seventh day he opened his eyes and asked his family, \"How much time is left for the sun to set?\"\nReading this story I remember why that pocket watch is given to people: so they don't even need to ask anybody else; just look at your pocket watch and be finished. Never present a pocket watch to anybody, because that simply means that you have taken it for granted that this man is gone. The pocket watch is the\nlast present.\nAnd the people said, \"The sun is just about to set within a few minutes.\" And he was showing such grace, such joy, such blissfulness, that the family could not believe the metamorphosis that these seven days have been. They all knew he was an ordinary man.\nThe wife knew, the father knew, the brothers knew that he had nothing special, but in seven days he has gone far beyond them.\nExactly as the sun was setting they all started crying and weeping. And he was saying to them, \"Be quiet. There is nothing to worry about.\"\nAt that moment Eknath arrived. The whole family touched his feet and told him, \"Save him. Can you do anything?\"\nEknath said, \"With death there is no possibility. Just let me see him.\"\nSo they all respectfully moved and gave way to Eknath. The man was sitting silently with closed eyes, looking almost like a marble statue of Gautam Buddha... in just seven days, and he was an ordinary person. Eknath called his name and said, \"I have come to see you and to tell you that it was only a device. You are not going to die. You have a lifeline that is very long. You will live almost as much as you have lived. You have lived only half the lifeline, so there are many years to live. This was a way to answer your question.\"\nThe man said, \"My God. I never thought that this is a way to answer my question.\"\nEknath said, \"There was no other way. Whatever I would have said to you, you would have remained with doubts. A man who can pretend for years to be happy can also lie that he is enlightened. I wanted to give you some experience of it, that it is not acting.\nAnd these seven days have given you the experience. Have you received the answer or not?\"\nThe man stood up, jumped out of the bed -- for seven days he had not left the bed at all --\ntouched the feet of Eknath and said, \"Your compassion is great. Unless your compassion was so great, you would not have lied. But you have answered my question. Now there is no doubt at all. And I cannot see that any doubt in the future is possible. I have known the space in which you are living.\"\nEknath said, \"It does not matter whether you are going to die after seven days or seventy years. Once you become aware that you are going to die, it does not matter when.\"\nThe awareness of death makes you live life as totally, as joyously as possible. Death is not your enemy. In fact, it is an invitation for you to live intensely, totally, to squeeze every drop of juice from every moment. Death is a tremendous challenge and invitation.\nWithout death there would not have been any Gautam Buddha, any Jesus, any Lao Tzu, any Tilopa. There would not have been any Kabir, any Raidas, any Mansoor, any Sarmad.\nIt is death and its awareness that makes you live as totally, as deeply, as consciously as possible. Before death knocks on your doors you should be able to see the eternal life within you. Then there is no death; death is a fiction. It is a reality only to those who have not lived, not lived in its completeness, in its entirety.\nFor those who have lived there is no death.\nIt is only a change -- just changing the house. I am reminded...\nOne night a thief entered into Mulla Nasruddin's house, and Mulla Nasruddin was trying to sleep. He had only one blanket, so half was used as a bed and half to cover himself.\nBut sleep was not coming because the mosquitoes were so interested in keeping him awake. They are great teachers who are continuously making an effort that you should not fall asleep. Their whole teaching is awareness. I always thought that these mosquitoes seem to be old masters trying their old teaching. Now they cannot speak, but they can manage to keep you awake.\nSo Mulla was turning and tossing, and then suddenly, he saw a thief entering. It was a dark night and the door was open. The thief was amazed. He hardly figured out that some man is sleeping; the house seems to be completely empty and all doors are open -- a great opportunity. So he entered inside the house and went on going to the innermost room, not being aware that he is being followed by Mulla Nasruddin.\nSuddenly Mulla stumbled on something so the thief became aware. Mulla said, \"Don't be worried. I have been living in this house for thirty years; and I have not found anything up to now. But perhaps with your expertise... we can both try to find something. Fifty-fifty?\"\nThe thief could not believe it. What kind of man is this? It is his own house. The thief became a little afraid; this man seems to be either mad or very dangerous. And Mulla said, \"Don't be worried. If you are not agreeing on fifty-fifty, you can have sixty, I can have forty -- or whatever you want. I have wasted thirty years searching and searching and I have not found anything. So whatever you want me to give, even five percent commission will do. You try. And I have brought a candle.\"\nHe lit the candle and he said, \"Because it is dark it will be difficult for you. So I will keep the candle and you search.\"\nThe thief said, \"I have also been stealing for the same time, thirty years, but I have never met a man like you. You amaze me.\"\nBut there was nothing at all, so they went around the whole house. They could not find anything. Finally the thief said, \"You are right, there is nothing to find.\"\nAs he was going out -- he had been into other houses before and he had left all the things that he has stolen from other houses outside the house -- Mulla went with him, threw his blanket also in the pile. The thief said, \"What are you doing?\"\nHe said, \"Nothing. I am coming with you, just changing houses.\"\nThe man said, \"This is an unnecessary trouble and this man seems to be a little crazy.\" He said, \"You can take your blanket.\"\nHe said, \"No. Either fifty-fifty...\"\nBut he said, \"I have stolen these things from other houses.\"\nHe said, \"That does not matter... otherwise the police station. Fifty-fifty? This is my only business. I keep my house open and the thieves come; they do the business.\"\nThe man said, \"You seem to be the greatest thief in the world. You never go out; thieves come by themselves.\"\nHe said, \"It has been happening. But if you want I am prepared to come with you, because what is there in this house?\"\nThe man became so afraid of Mulla because he could not put him into any category. He said, \"You can keep everything, just leave me... And I will never come back.\"\nMulla said, \"As you wish, but I was always thinking of changing my house. You will also get the blanket and the whole treasure that you have stolen from other houses, and me who can advise you. You are just amateur. You may have been stealing for thirty years, but you don't know much. I don't go anywhere and thieves come by themselves and fifty-fifty, sometimes even more, sometimes a hundred percent. Because I am always happy to change the house and they are afraid to take me to their house.\"\nThe man who knows himself knows death as only changing the house. Acceptance is not the right word, but there is no other word; this is the difficulty.\nI would say, Chintan, rejoice! Make all these days a celebration.\nAnd if you can make all these days a celebration, your death will be found to be a fiction.\nThese days of celebration and meditation and silence and joy and love will create in you the capacity to die consciously. And one who dies consciously knows that death is nothing but changing the house. And it is always for a better house because life always goes upwards; it is an evolutionary process.\nI was really shocked by the American government particularly, Ronald Reagan's\ngovernment. They have prohibited the universities and colleges and schools to teach Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Books on the theory of evolution have been burned or removed from all libraries, because this theory of evolution goes against the Christian idea of creation. You may not immediately get the difference, but the difference is there.\nGod created everything so there is no question of any evolution. He created monkeys as monkeys, and he created men as men -- not that the monkeys have evolved into man; there is no evolution. God has made the world perfect. Evolution is possible only if things are imperfect.\nThis fundamentalist, fascist, fanatical idea of Ronald Reagan has been imposed on the whole of America, and nobody is protesting that it is against the constitution of America.\nIt is against democracy; it is against freedom of expression. The American constitution makes it clear that religion should not interfere with people's lives, particularly via government powers: the government should be neutral. But this is not neutrality.\nAnd to stop the whole of America knowing anything about Charles Darwin and his theory of evolution is dangerous, because it means you cannot evolve. You are what you are. It is dangerous. I am not saying whether Charles Darwin is right or wrong; that is not my business. I am saying that the idea of evolution should not be taken away from people's minds. In fact, they should be made more aware that for thousands of years we are not evolving -- we should evolve.\nAnd now outside we have got everything. Evolution should take on a different dimension, an inner evolution. But to destroy the whole idea...! Ronald Reagan has done much harm to America, but this is his greatest harm, because this will mean that if the idea of evolution completely disappears from peoples' minds, then wherever they are, God wants them to be there: in misery, in suffering, in anguish, in angst. But that's what God wants, and there is no possibility of evolution.\nI don't support the particulars of Charles Darwin, but I support the essential fact that evolution has been happening, because we have seen man becoming a Gautam Buddha. I don't agree that monkeys have become men. And even if they have, it does not bother me; it is perfectly good.\nMy concern is for the future, not for the past. I want man to evolve. It does not matter whether monkeys evolve into men or not, but man can evolve into superman, into new man. But that evolution will happen only through deep meditation, watchfulness, waiting and accepting life with joy, and accepting death with joy, with no reluctance, without any pressure, but from your innermost feeling.\nEverything that is, is beautiful.\nIt can be more beautiful -- there is no limit to evolution. Particularly for consciousness there is no limit; it can go even beyond Gautam Buddha, beyond Bodhidharma, beyond all the great awakened people of the past, because consciousness has no limits. It is as vast as the sky, as the whole universe.\nChintan, accept with joy and dance and song.\nJust a little joke so that you go from here not with serious faces. This temple believes in laughter and I want everybody who comes here to go laughing. Even on the way, when he remembers -- a little giggle. In the night, in the middle of the night, then he remembers\n-- a good laugh.\nA good laugh is the greatest prayer.\nA little boy on a picnic strays away from his family and suddenly realizes he is lost and night is falling. After running around and shouting for a while he becomes very frightened and kneels down to pray with uplifted hands.\n\"Dear Lord,\" he says, \"please help me to find my mummy and daddy and I promise I won't hit my sister anymore.\"\nJust then a bird flies overhead and shits right into his outstretched hands. The boy examines it, looks up to heaven and says, \"Lord, don't give me this shit, I really am lost.\"\nEverybody is really lost. Very few people have reached their home. But your pilgrimage of finding your home should not be serious and sad and heavy; it should be of laughter and song and dance. If you can find your home dancing, laughing, it is true finding. By sadness and seriousness you are bound to find\nsome graveyard, not your home.\nWe need people who are seekers but not serious. That kind of seeking, serious and sad, has not led man anywhere.\nOkay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.\nThe Invitation Chapter #19\nChapter title: Pick up the roses and avoid the thorns 30 August 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium Archive\ncode: 8708305\nShortTitle: INVITA19\nAudio: Yes Video: Yes Length: 85\nmins\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHEN YOU WERE RESPONDING TO SARJANO'S QUESTION, I HEARD YOU\nSAY THAT A DISCIPLE CAN SAY NO TO THE MASTER IF THE LOVE IS DEEP\nENOUGH.\nI CAN UNDERSTAND YOUR SAYING NO TO US OUT OF YOUR LOVE, BUT\nNOT THE OTHER WAY ROUND.\nDO YOU MEAN THAT THE DISCIPLE MUST HAVE THE FREEDOM TO SAY NO\nBUT IN FACT WOULD NEVER WISH TO OR NEED TO? FROM MY\nEXPERIENCE, WHEN I HAVE SAID NO TO YOU I HAVE DENIED MYSELF AND\nTHEN SUFFERED THE CONSEQUENCES.\nHOW CAN THERE BE ANY SITUATION IN WHICH THE DEVOTEE WOULD SAY\nNO TO THE MASTER?\nManeesha, the question you have asked raises many questions: questions about love, questions about freedom, questions about the master and disciple and their relationship.\nLife appears to be very simple but as you go deeper into it, it becomes more and more complex. And the ultimate complexity is that life consists of contradictions. If you understand, those contradictions become complementaries. If you don't understand those contradictions become opposites.\nBut in the ultimate organic unity there is enough space for both yes and no. It will not be ultimate organic unity if there is only space for yes, if there is space only for light, if there is space only for love, and not their opposites.\nOur mind looks at things in categories of opposition, but mind is not the ultimate decisive factor. The ultimate decisive factor is a state of no-mind. In a state of no-mind everything is possible. The incomprehensible is also possible; the impossible is also possible.\nApparently you are right, that the disciple cannot say no; how can the disciple say no to the master? In what situations? It has been the tradition that no has always been taken as negative. With me, things have a far deeper meaning and significance. No is not necessarily negative and yes is not necessarily positive. You can say yes out of fear, then it is negative. You can say no out of love. You love so much that you are not worried even to say no. The no becomes affirmative; it is no longer negative.\nAs far as I am concerned, I am not part of any old category of masters. I am a new beginning in the sense that the old master demanded surrender. I don't demand anything from you, because to me surrender is a subtle spiritual slavery. Of course, with a master the surrender feels beautiful but even if slavery is decorated with flowers I cannot be deceived by it.\nI want my people to be individuals living in freedom. If they love me it is out of their freedom, not out of fear, not out of desire, not out of some longing for achievement. The old disciple was surrendering himself because he wanted to be enlightened. The master was being used as a means. I don't allow myself to be used as a means. That is ugly.\nThe old master was using the disciples for his own egoistic ends. The masters in the past used to brag about how many disciples they had. The number of the disciples decided the greatness of the master. The master was also dependent in a certain sense on the disciples. It is something to be understood that you cannot make anybody dependent without yourself becoming dependent too. And the same is true if you are independent, you would love to make everybody independent. Because independent individuality has such beauty and grace, such joy, such freedom to fly in the sky with no boundaries and no chains, with no conditions, no expectations, that a master would love his disciples to be ultimately free, free even of himself.\nZarathustra has said to his disciples: \"Beware of me.\" That small statement contains great meaning, because a disciple can renounce everything to be one with the master, to come closer and closer to the master; he can even sacrifice himself. But in this sacrificing he will enjoy a certain unburdening, because now he is no longer responsible. The whole responsibility is on the shoulders of the master. The disciple has become a sheep and the master has become the shepherd. Now the shepherd will take care.\nOne can think in this way that the sheep has attained a certain freedom -- freedom from responsibility. But becoming a sheep, even if you become free, your freedom has no meaning. It is fear; it is irresponsibility. In a deeper sense you have lost yourself to gain something. It is not out of love that you have surrendered to the master; out of love there is no surrender, there is no need.\nLove is a far bigger phenomenon than any surrender. Surrender is of the mind and surrender is an effort. Love is of the heart and it is not an effort. You suddenly find yourself in love with someone. Even if you try to be in love with someone you cannot succeed. No effort is going to be successful. Love comes just like the spring comes, and when love comes it brings many flowers.\nThere have been two kinds of masters. The majority of the masters in the past demanded surrender, total surrender. It was a kind of spiritual slavery. The master was enjoying a great ego, and the disciple was enjoying a great unburdening from all responsibilities.\nNow the master is going to save him. Now the master is his salvation, liberation, enlightenment. All that he could do he has surrendered himself. He has become an absolute yes.\nTo me this kind of relationship was not healthy, something was basically wrong. Because of this situation in the past one man stands separate from the whole crowd of masters, and that is J. Krishnamurti. He denied he was a master and he refused to accept anybody as a disciple; this was another extreme. The other masters were demanding absolute surrender. J. Krishnamurti has lived with masters who have asked absolute surrender from him, and as he became more and more mature he saw the whole game: the master enjoys the ego, the disciple enjoys irresponsibility. But neither the master is a true master nor the disciple is a true disciple; both are exploiting each other.\nThere is no question of love when there is exploitation. Krishnamurti refused to be master of anyone and he refused to allow anyone to think that he is a disciple. He has taken a great step but he has moved to the very extreme. And always remember: if one extreme is wrong the other extreme cannot be right. The right is always somewhere exactly in the middle, the golden mean. Only in the middle is there balance, and only in the middle, exactly in the middle, is there transcendence of the polarities, of the opposites.\nMy position is exactly in the middle. I don't ask any surrender from you; hence, I am not on the old track. I don't deny you the beauty of being a disciple. I don't insult you; I don't reject you. I accept your love, but I will not accept your surrender. In accepting your love and your disciplehood I am your master, but there is no relationship of surrender.\nI am not here to erase your individuality. I am here just to erase your ego.\nThat does not need any surrender, it needs a deep meditative understanding on your part.\nI can give you love, I can share my own understanding with you, but there is no condition attached to it. My joy will be to see you as a growing individual in total freedom. And in total freedom, yes is as much possible as no.\nI can understand Maneesha's problem, that no is very difficult, more difficult to a master who does not ask surrender. No becomes more difficult because the master allows it. If the master does not allow no, he is repressing something in you, and his not allowing no does not destroy the possibility of no in you. On the contrary, the master himself is afraid that if you are not prevented, you can say no.\nThe yes from you is meaningless if you are not free to say no. Your yes has meaning only because you are absolutely free to say no. It does not mean that you have to say no. It does not mean that there will be a situation where you have to say no. In fact it will become more and more impossible for you to say no.\nTo say no is easy when you are prevented, prohibited. Then, it becomes a question of your individuality; it becomes a question of your spiritual freedom.\nAnd certainly anybody who has any dignity is bound to find situations where he would like to say no. If he does not say it he is behaving as a hypocrite. He is not saying no because he is afraid to lose the love of the master and to lose the possibility of getting higher states of consciousness.\nBut this is business, this is cunningness. And there should not exist any business or any cunningness between the master and the disciple.\nKrishnamurti has moved to the very extreme: no master, no disciple. But that created an absurd situation, for his whole life, and he lived long, ninety years. He started being a teacher at the age of fifteen, and he wrote his first book AT THE FEET OF THE\nMASTER at the age of fifteen. It was so early that later on he could not even remember whether he had written it or not. It appeared as if in a dream, far away, just an echo.\nFrom the age of fifteen to the age of ninety, almost seventy-five years continuously -- no master has been teaching so long. Gautam Buddha was teaching for only forty-two years; so was Mahavira. Jesus taught for only three years, because at the age of thirty-three he was crucified; he started his teaching career at the age of thirty. Perhaps Krishnamurti is the only person who has been a teacher for seventy-five years.\nBut the question is that his situation is very absurd. If he does not accept himself to be master and he does not accept you as disciples, then what is he doing for seventy-five years? Running around and around all over the world what is he doing... to whom he is talking?\nThe word `disciple' does not mean anything else other than a learner; that is its original meaning. If he is not talking to people who are ready to learn, then what is the point of talking? And if Krishnamurti is not a master, from where does he get the authority to talk, to say anything to anybody? He goes on denying that he is a master, and everybody knows he is a master. And he goes on saying, \"You are not the disciples,\" and everybody who listens to him, learns from him, feels a certain disciplehood.\nBoth are denying actualities. Out of fear that they may not get trapped into the past relationship of master and disciple. This whole seventy-five years of J. Krishnamurti are full of fear, the fear of the past heritage, centuries of master and\ndisciple relationship, because it has become a spiritual slavery. The disciple could not say no. Rather than allowing the disciple to say no he simple denied that there is a disciple. It is not a great revolution; it is just a reaction, moving from one extreme wrong situation to another wrong situation, another extreme.\nI am standing exactly in the middle. I can see both the extremes, the right and the left.\nAnd I can see that both are half, incomplete. Both are not going to help anybody to attain to spiritual freedom. The first because it insists on surrendering, and the second because it simply denies that you are a disciple. And Krishnamurti goes on teaching for seventy-five years continuously, and becomes angry when the listeners don't listen rightly.\nYou will be surprised to know that Krishnamurti used to become very angry at times when he saw somebody listening to him for fifty years and still he has not understood anything. He would just look at the people and beat his head -- it was absolutely natural. I will not say that it was unnatural, but he created the situation. In the very first place he denied disciplehood, and then he wants them to understand him.\nI accept the status of a master and the status of a disciple. There is nothing wrong in it if the master and disciple are not exploiting each other. If the disciple is not using the master as a means to enlightenment, liberation, and the master is not using the disciple for his own aggrandizement, for his own ego-fulfillment. I want disciples and masters to stand side by side in deep love, with no question of any surrender, with no expectation from the master that you have always to say yes.\nMy own experience is the more you are prohibited from doing something the more there is a desire to do it. Prohibition is a kind of provocation.\nI don't prohibit you.\nIt does not disturb me or my individuality if you say no. On this point Maneesha is right, that whenever she has said no, she has suffered the consequences. But that is up to you --\nnot my expectation. It is going to be your understanding that when you say no, you have taken yourself as if you are wiser; you will suffer the consequences.\nI have not said to Sarjano, \"You will not suffer the consequences of your no.\" But it will not be from me: not that I will be annoyed, not that I will be irritated, not that I will be angry. It is perfectly okay with me whether you say yes or no. But for yourself there is going to be a difference. Yes means you are listening and following what I am saying. No means you are deciding for yourselves. As far as I am concerned you are absolutely free to decide for yourself, but then you have to be ready for the consequences also.\nFreedom brings responsibility.\nThat's the meaning I continuously repeat, and I know you don't understand. Everybody likes freedom and nobody likes responsibility, but they come in the same package; you cannot separate them. I give you freedom AND I give you responsibility. You cannot complain about me, because you are always free to say no. You cannot say that I have inhibited you, because I have not asked that you say yes whether you want or not. You cannot blame me.\nThis is absolutely true, that whenever you will say yes, you will find a peace, a silence.\nAnd whenever you will say no, you will find a deep burden on your heart, almost a wound. But you are creating that wound. And I will not prevent you, because I know that preventing provokes people to do the same thing that is being prevented.\nA famous Tibetan story...\nA man was serving an old master continuously, bringing food, bringing water from the well, massaging his feet. And the old man used to say, \"Why are you wasting your time?\"\nbecause the old man understood perfectly that there must be some desire.\nFinally, one day the man said, \"I am serving you because I want to learn some miracle, just one miracle.\"\nThe old man said, \"But I don't know any miracle. You have unnecessarily wasted your time. You should find somebody else who knows about miracles.\"\nBut the man said, \"I have been told that you always deny that you know any\nmiracles, and you go on continuously performing miracles. I have been told,\n`Don't listen. Go on serving him. One day he will tell you some secret, but only when he finds you are ripe.'\nPerhaps I am not ripe yet.\"\nAfter a few days the old man saw that this man is still unnecessarily working. \"Somebody has put the idea in his mind that I perform miracles. Perhaps miracles happen, but they happen on their own. I am not the performer.\"\nWith people of great consciousness things happen just on their own. Just as when the sun rises birds sing; it is not that the sun is performing a miracle. Flowers open their petals, not that the sun is performing a miracle, just the presence of the sun and things start happening. The presence of a very conscious awakened man is enough for many flowers to open, for many birds to sing.\nThe old man said, \"It seems you will not leave me unless I tell you the secret.\" The man said, \"That's true.\"\nSo he said, \"I will tell you the secret. I wrote a small mantra, the Tibetan mantra om mani padme hum.\"\nOm means the eternal sound of existence. Diamond in the lotus, mani padme hum: mani means diamond, padme means lotus. It means the eternal sound and the diamond in the lotus. It expresses the meaning of enlightenment: the eternal music all around, the beauty of the lotus, and inside the lotus the light of a diamond. In a small mantra they have condensed the whole experience of enlightenment.\nSo the old man said, \"Take this mantra and repeat it five times, just five times. First take a bath, change your clothes to fresh clothes, close your door, sit alone and repeat the mantra five times. Then you will be able to do any miracle you want to do.\"\nThe man rushed, he did not even show his gratitude or even say just a Thank You. He simply rushed down the steps of the temple. When he was just in the middle the old man shouted, \"Wait, I have forgotten one thing. While you are repeating the mantra remember one thing: don't think of any monkey.\"\nThe man said, \"Why should I think of a monkey? I have never thought of it in my whole life!\"\nThe old man said, \"That's okay, just remember that. No monkey allowed at all. If the monkey comes in you have to repeat the mantra five times again.\"\nThe man said, \"But why should the monkey come?\"\nThe old man said, \"I don't know. I have told you the secret. This is the secret my master has told me.\"\nBut he could not even get down the steps before he started thinking about monkeys. He said, \"My God, I have not started the mantra yet and monkeys are coming.\" He will close his eyes and there were monkeys and monkeys, giggling, making faces at him. He said,\n\"It is a strange mantra. I have not started yet.\"\nHe reached home crowded with monkeys. Wherever he will look, he could see only a monkey. He went inside, took a bath, but it was no use. Even in the bathroom, inside the bathroom with the door closed, monkeys were sitting all around. He said, \"That old man is such an idiot. If this monkey was the trouble he should not have mentioned it.\nElephants are not coming, camels are not coming, lions are not coming; nobody is coming except the monkey.\"\nThen he sat in a lotus posture with closed eyes but it was useless. The monkeys were nudging him; the monkeys were sitting; it was a congregation of monkeys all around. He was very worried. His wife passed, and he looked and sometimes it looked as if she is a monkey and sometimes she looked...\"No, no, she is my wife.\" His father passed. And sometimes he looked like an old monkey, and sometimes he looked like the father. The man said, \"I'm going mad.\"\nFive times was too much. Even to complete the mantra om mani padme hum, just those four words, and there were so many monkeys. The whole night he tried hard. He took a bath many times. He thought perhaps the clothes are not as fresh as they should be, so in the middle of the night, in the cold winter, he stood naked. Now there was no question of dirty clothes or anything. But the monkeys were sitting in lotus posture all around. He started shouting at them and they\nlaughed.\nBy the morning he was almost mad. He said, \"That old man is tricky. For years I served him. Finally he gave me the secret and managed to destroy the secret by keeping the monkey with it.\"\nHe went back to the old man, returned the mantra and he said, \"Keep it with you because those monkeys...\"\nThe old man said, \"You said they never come to you.\"\nHe said, \"I have not dreamt or seen or even thought about a single monkey in my whole life. There are millions of animals I have not thought about; there is no need. If you had not said the word I would have been able to perform miracles but now it is impossible.\"\nThe master said, \"What can I do? That monkey comes with the mantra. Without the monkey the mantra is useless. Unless you can avoid the monkeys you cannot perform miracles.\"\nHe said, \"I have forgotten all miracles. I just pray that you take your mantra and relieve me of the monkeys, because I am afraid that the mantra is gone but the monkeys may not go. And I have small children and a wife and an old father. I have to take care of them. I cannot go on fighting with these monkeys the whole day and night.\"\nThe old man said, \"Once you have left the mantra with me they will not come. They are very religious people.\"\nThe man went. And he was surprised, he looked all around, no monkey. When he reached home, the wife looked like the wife, the father looked like the father and the children looked like the children. He said, \"It is strange.\" He took a bath, the bathroom was empty.\nThe mantra was short. He said, \"Although I have returned his written mantra, I have been repeating it the whole night, so I have remembered it. There is no harm... now I can repeat it.\"\nThe moment he started one monkey appeared just as he said Om. And a few monkeys were around saying Om. He dropped the whole idea. He said, \"I should\ngo to my shop and look at my business. This idea of performing miracles is not for me.\"\nIf I say to you, \"Never say no to me,\" you will find many many times the desire to say no; hence I give you absolute freedom. It is up to you to say yes or to say no. You are to decide your own destiny. I can only help you, suggest to you, show you the way. But you can say, \"I don't want to go\" -- I cannot force you. You can accept my understanding.\nYou can reject it, and in your rejection I don't think that there is less love. That's why I said if you deeply love me you will not be worried by saying no. But I have not mentioned anything that will happen to you.\nBy saying no you are relieving me from responsibility. You are taking the responsibility into your own hands. Now if things go wrong you cannot complain about me. When you say yes and things go right I cannot brag about it. The yes is yours; the no is yours; the consequence will be yours.\nI love you enough -- hence I give you total freedom. If you love yourself enough, you will be aware what no can do to you and what yes can do to you.\nI teach you awareness and then leave you. A man of awareness will not try to go through the walls, he will find the door. A man of awareness will pick up roses and will avoid the thorns.\nI give you freedom, and in giving you freedom I feel absolutely free. I don't have any burden of solving, saving, liberating humanity. I don't have any burden at all. I am absolutely weightless. I am not a savior, not a messiah, not a messenger.\nI have chosen a third category. Just as Krishnamurti is alone on the extreme left, I am alone in the middle. And Krishnamurti is reacting against the tradition. I am not reacting, I am simply acting out of understanding. I can see where the old pattern went wrong. I will not do just the opposite because just the opposite will also go wrong. I am doing something exactly in the middle.\nSo I don't deny your discipleship. I don't deny it because I respect you. I love you. I cannot say I am not a master because I know, I have experienced, I can share it with you.\nThen it is up to you to say yes or no.\nManeesha is right. So as a footnote remember her, that no will bring its own consequences. It is not that I will punish you, your no will punish you itself. Yes will bring its own rewards. It is not that I will reward you; yes brings its own rewards.\nBetween me and you there is no relationship other than of love. But it is good that Maneesha has raised the question; otherwise, there was a possibility that many may have misunderstood.\nThe concerned doctor is trying to convince the patient that he is overweight. \"Now just step on the scales,\" says the doctor. \"There... you see? Now look at this chart and compare your weight with the average weight for your height. You are way overweight.\"\n\"No, I am not,\" says the patient. \"I am just six inches too short.\"\nIt is a very difficult world -- misunderstanding is possible everywhere.\nThe matronly woman was alone in the house watching her favorite television program when her husband burst through the front door, stalked into the bedroom without saying a word, and began packing his suitcase.\n\"Where are you going?\" she demanded.\n\"I resigned from the firm today. I'm sick and tired of you, and I'm going to Australia. I'm told that the young ladies there will gladly pay five dollars a night for the services of a good man, and I intend to live off the earnings from my lovemaking.\"\nHe then continued to pack. Suddenly his wife pulled her suitcase from the closet and began packing her own clothing. \"And where do you think you are going?\" he demanded.\n\"To Australia,\" she laughed. \"I want to see how you are going to live on ten dollars a month.\"\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHENEVER ANY EMOTIONS GET TRIGGERED, MY ATTEMPTS AT\nWATCHING USUALLY RESULT IN MIND TRIPS, UNLESS I DO SOMETHING\nLIKE RUN AROUND BUDDHA HALL A COUPLE OF TIMES FIRST.\nI FEEL THAT IF I COULD TURN ALL THIS ENERGY IN, INSTEAD OF OUT, GREAT THINGS COULD HAPPEN.\nWHILE YOU TALK TO US ABOUT WATCHING, IT FEELS SO SIMPLE. AND\nBASKING IN YOUR SILENCE, I WONDER HOW IT CAN BE A PROBLEM. BELOVED MASTER, WHAT AM I MISSING, OR AM I TOO IMPATIENT?\nPrashanto, the first thing is to remember that the exact purpose of Buddha Hall is what you are doing.\nGo on running as long as you don't fall down. Fall down on the ground not by any effort, but just let it happen by running continuously. The time will come when you will fall down. Then rest there and you will find immense peace and great silence which you have never known.\nThis is exactly the purpose of Dynamic Meditation: to exhaust your energy, so the mind has no more supply of energy to create thoughts and dreams and imaginations. So you are using the Buddha Hall perfectly correctly for the first time, knowing that that is the purpose of it.\nI have never told anybody, because then from tomorrow you will see there will be two big crowds running.\nExhaust the outgoing energy and suddenly you will find you are in. To go in, you don't need any energy, you are there. The outgoing energy has to be exhausted, so you cannot go out. As far as going in is concerned that is a wrong idea; nobody goes in. How can you go in? That's where you are! You can go out -- that's okay.\nSo go to Buddha Hall and run as much as you can. Don't stop in the middle\nthinking that it is too tiring. Go on, go on, let the body according to its own wisdom fall down. Don't act, don't try to deceive, because you are deceiving yourself. And if you can allow the body to go on running till it falls, then lie down there on the ground, and you would be surprised that you have never known such peace, such silence, such deep meditation.\nGautam Buddha himself... If you go to Bodhgaya where he became enlightened -\n- that's why the name of the city has become Bodhgaya. Gaya must have been the name of the town but when Gautam Buddha became enlightened, bodh means enlightenment, so the city of Gaya became Bodhgaya. There is a temple in his memory made almost two thousand years ago and there is the tree under which he used to sit.\nIf you go to Bodhgaya you will still find what I have described to you by the side of the temple and nearly two hundred stones in a line. For one hour Gautam Buddha used to sit and meditate, and for one hour he used to walk on those stones and meditate. When he became tired of walking he would sit; when he became tired of sitting he would walk.\nThis way he exhausted his outgoing energy.\nOne day he found there is no energy at all for any outgoing. He remained in. And this remaining in revealed to him his luminous being, his ultimate consciousness.\nIn language it is a problem; we say, go in. You cannot go in, because if you go in, then that \"in\" will also be out. You can only go out; you cannot go in.\nIn, you are. What do you mean by \"in\"? It is not the inside of your house; it is where you are. There you don't need going, all that you need is that you don't have any energy to go out, so naturally you remain still and silent and in. Suddenly there is an explosion of light and bliss and ecstasy.\nSo you have found a beautiful meditation, Prashanto. Continue, and you will find many more from tomorrow on the way. Don't chitchat with anybody. The moment you enter the path by the side of Buddha Hall forget that anybody else exists in the world: you and the road, till you fall down. Then in a day you can achieve something which you may not be able to achieve in one year's Dynamic Meditation. This is the ultimate dynamic meditation!\nI have not told people but you have found it, so now I have to recognize it.\nJust remember one thing, that you are not to stop by yourself. Because if you stop you will miss the point, you will always stop before the energy is finished. That's why I'm saying go on and on and on till you cannot go on, and you fall. Don't pretend to fall, because those are all deceptions that you can detect yourself. You know perfectly well when you are pretending to fall and when you are really falling.\nSo don't misunderstand me. The real thing will happen only when automatically you find yourself falling. You are just a watcher, not a doer. And a tremendous experience is possible.\nThe father was having a heart-to-heart talk with his son before the boy's marriage.\n\"Son,\" he said, \"I have two bits of advice for you before you get married. First, you must tell your wife, right from the start, that you insist on spending one night each week out with the boys.\"\n\"And what,\" asked the son, \"is the second bit of advice?\" His father smiled and said, \"Don't waste it on the boys.\"\nHymie Goldberg goes for his weekly visit to the doctor and says, \"Doc, I snore so loudly that I keep myself awake. What can I do?\"\nThe doctor rolls his eyes and says, \"Why don't you try sleeping in another room?\"\nSo Prashanto, just get exactly what I am saying.\nA Jew and an Irishman were fishing in separate boats some distance apart. The Irishman got a bite and was so nervous that he fell out of the boat. He sank twice, and as he was coming up the second time, the Jew rowed over and called out: \"Mister, can I have your boat if you don't come up again?\"\nPeople have their own understanding. Just get exactly what I have told you, and when something happens report to me, because everybody will be waiting, \"What happened to Prashanto?\" And tomorrow everybody will be watching! I\nhave made you a hero within a second. Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho. The Invitation Chapter #20\nChapter title: Those third rate politicians, those dwellers of the gutter 31 August 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium\nArchive code: 8708310\nShortTitle: INVITA20\nAudio:\nYes Video:\nYes Length:\n89\nmins Question 1\nBELOVED OSHO,\nIN CANADA, WHERE I LIVE, I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN\nNATIONAL POLITICS. SHOULD I REFRAIN, GIVEN THE STATE OF POLITICS\nIN THE WEST, OR SHOULD I ACCEPT AND USE THE EXPERIENCE AS ANOTHER DIMENSION OF MY PROCESS?\nRupananda, it is well known what I think about politics, but I will not say anything to you, this way or that.\nMy whole approach to my people is that of freedom. You have to act out of your own intelligence. You don't have to depend on my advice.\nI go on giving you my experiences, my attitudes, but there is no compulsion that you have to follow them. You are not my followers, you are my friends.\nI cannot impose my ideas on someone I love; I give you absolute freedom to do whatsoever your intelligence, your meditativeness allows you. And I don't think you will go wrong.\nJust don't be attracted by ambition, don't be attracted by power, because those infatuations are destructive. And the people who become attracted by things like money, power, prestige, miss one thing: that is life.\nBalzar has a law about it: Life is what happens to you while you are making other plans.\nA politician has no life, he is always making other plans, and meanwhile life goes on slipping by. But still, it is going to be your choice.\nI never want to be remembered by you as someone who forced, manipulated, dominated you according to his ideas. I can share everything with you, but the final decision has to be yours, because that's how one matures. If you feel like going into politics, just think what you can contribute, or you will also become part of the whole dirty game that goes on in the name of politics.\nYou are asking me, \"Should I get into the gutter?\" I will not prevent you. If you enjoy it is perfectly okay with me! But always remember, don't take part in\nanything unless you are ready so that you can improve it, you can give it some refinement -- not only about action, but also about talk. Cogglin's Law is: Don't talk unless you can improve the silence. It is a tremendously beautiful statement: Don't talk unless you can improve the silence -- very insightful.\nDon't go into politics unless you can improve humanity and you can improve people's humbleness... not getting into a competitive will to power, because that kind of thing happens only when you are feeling empty inside. I have never heard of any politician becoming enlightened -- that will be a contradiction in terms -- nor vice versa, have I ever heard of any enlightened man being a politician.\nYou think you will be exploring a new dimension through the gutter? Through the gutter you will get into a deeper gutter, a bigger gutter, the main gutter. It is not a dimension; it is simply falling from your intelligence, it is not maturity. A certain retardedness is absolutely necessary in politics. If you feel you qualify...! You have to be continuously lying, you have to be promising things which you know perfectly well you cannot deliver.\nJust the other night I was reading about a rabbi who wrote a letter to a friend, but a very strange letter. He wrote a small paragraph and then left almost the whole page, and signed underneath. That is not the way people write a letter. When you write a letter, you sign underneath it... this much gap. The man was also puzzled when he received the letter. He inquired of him, \"What is the reason for leaving such a big gap between the letter and the signature?\"\nHe said, \"It says in the scriptures, `Keep yourself as far away from lies as possible.'\"\nBut still, if you like there is no problem; there are many sannyasins in the same gutter in different countries. A certain cruelty, inhumanity, cunningness are the basic requirements for you to become a politician. So I am worried whether you have all these prerequisite conditions. Innocence is of no use; that will bring failure. Silence is of no use, truthfulness is of no use, to be sharply intelligent is no use. And remember one thing: politics gives you power, but it gives you power by making you a beggar. All politicians are beggars, whether they may be presidents or prime ministers.\nEvery five years, and they are standing on your door with their begging bowl.\nThey are, in fact, servants of the people. At least they have to pretend after each five years. For five years they can believe they are masters, but they cannot befool anybody of intelligence.\nAnd this reminds me that the people from whom you are going to beg for votes are ignorant, prejudiced, are not contemporaries. They belong to past centuries, many centuries back; they are superstitious. If you want to have their votes, you have to fall to their standard; they are not going to rise to your standard.\nTo be a politician is a tragedy. But still, if you want to make your life a tragedy I have no objection. The whole politics around the world misses anything significant for the future.\nIt is too much concerned with trivia, small, ugly conflicts. It is not interested in reality to improve the destiny of humanity, to give new dreams to people, to bring more poetry into their lives. On the contrary, it destroys their dreams, it destroys their hopes; it destroys their trust in other human beings, because they have been continuously cheated by the politicians, exploited.\nOscar Wilde has said, \"A map of the world that does not include utopia is not worth glancing at.\" But no politician can remain successfully in politics with a utopian mind; he has to be practical, pragmatic. He has to forget fundamental things, that through wrong means you can never reach the right end. Only the right means justify the rightness of your ends. But no politician can manage to follow right means towards right ends. He may talk about right ends, right values, but all his means will be wrong, and through wrong means you never reach to right ends; they don't connect.\nYou have to be mean. You have to be destructive. If needed, you have to commit all kinds of crime. If you can do all these things, only then you can become a politician. It is an absolutely foolish and absurd game, and particularly for a sannyasin who is searching for higher values, who is looking for inner reality -- who is thinking of beauty, truth, good. Politics is just the opposite. A sannyasin is trying to find his authentic being, and the politician has to create a false personality according to what people need.\nA politician has to say things which he does not mean but which satisfy people. He can never speak his mind; in fact, people who have gone deep in understanding the psychology of politics, say in politics mind is not needed at\nall. We don't see any politician functioning in a way that shows his genius. There have been millions of geniuses, nobody was attracted towards politics, only very mediocre people. In a way they represent the unintelligent, unevolved masses. They are the representatives of the slaves.\nI have heard...\nA great politician's brain surgery was being done. When the surgeons opened his brain they saw so much rubbish and garbage that they thought it is better to take the whole mind out of the skull and clean it; they have never seen anything so dirty. So they left the politician in anesthesia, so he was not aware, and they went into another room.\nMeanwhile, the politician came out of anesthesia, was resting on the bed, when a man came rushing and shouted, \"What are you doing here? You have been chosen as the president.\"\nHe said, \"My God! What am I doing here?\" -- and got up.\nThe surgeons looked from the other room, and said, \"Hey! Where are you going? Your brain is here; we are cleaning it!\"\nThe man said, \"Now I don't need it! Clean it well and keep it. When I am no longer the president of the country I may need it, but right now there is no problem.\"\nWhat use is a mind to the president?\nPresidents are chosen who have no minds of their own, so they can simply function as rubber stamps.\nPolitics is a strange world, but if you want to have some taste of the ugliest part of human beings, you can go into politics. Just remember one thing: going in is easy, getting out will be very difficult, almost impossible. It is getting into deep imprisonment by your own desires. But there are people who are jailbirds; they like prison. I have known many politicians; I have not seen anything worthwhile in their lives. They have staked everything just to be in power. And what will these people do with power? They will create more wars, they will create more weapons, they will create more possibilities for a global suicide.\nThese are my ideas about politics, but these are my ideas, you don't have to follow them.\nIf you are feeling a certain urge for power, go into it. Of course I cannot bless you. I will feel sad and sorry for your going in a wrong direction, but I cannot prevent you either, because any interference in your life is against my whole approach. So please, meditate over it.\nGo around Buddha Hall; you will find Prashanto there, either enlightened or dead! That is far better than going into politics.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nI HAVE BEEN IN SOME LONG RELATIONSHIPS FOR MANY YEARS. WHEN I HEAR YOU TALKING ABOUT JEALOUSY AND FIGHTING AND ALL THESE\nPASSIONATE THINGS IN RELATIONSHIPS, I BECOME REALLY SHAKY, BECAUSE IT SEEMS I NEVER EXPERIENCE THESE THINGS REALLY\nSTRONGLY. LAST NIGHT I GOT VERY SAD ABOUT IT, AND THE QUESTION\nCAME UP WHETHER I EVER REALLY LOVED SOMEBODY, WHETHER I REALLY DID LET GO AND LOSE CONTROL.\nBELOVED MASTER, DO LOVE AND HATE, FIGHTING AND HARMONY, COOLNESS AND PASSION REALLY ALWAYS BELONG TOGETHER?\nAnand Vimlan, there are always exceptions. My feeling about you is that you are being sad unnecessarily. Life allows exceptions: very rarely you will find a couple who is not in a love-hate relationship but simply in love. Naturally, this kind of love will have a certain coolness about it, it cannot be hot.\nTo make it hot, you have to bring the opposite in; then fighting and quarreling and arguing gives a certain excitement to your energies. And when tired of fighting and arguing, you again move -- the pendulum goes on moving between love and hate. When your pendulum moves towards love, you feel strong love\nbecause of the contrast. It depends on your likings: people like hotdogs! Dogs are enough, but they want hot dogs!\nYour love is of a silent type, peaceful. There are rivers which are mountainous, falling from mountains as waterfalls into the valleys; there is much going on. And there are rivers which flow in the valleys silently, so silent that you cannot see that they are flowing. But I don't think that you have to be sad about it; it is a higher quality of love which is cool, without any excitement, without any heat.\nDon't you love ice cream... a cool breeze, a silent house; no pillow fighting, no plates being broken? I know it brings a little spice in life when pillows are going like missiles in the air, but that kind of spice...? That kind of excitement is stupid.\nA love that can be cool, and without a hot passion, is a higher quality. Every love should become of that quality.\nAn ancient seer of this country has made a very strange statement. For centuries in this part of the world, when people get married they go to some master, to some wise man to have his blessings; that is conventional. That is more important than the marriage done by the priest. The blessings of a wise man or an enlightened man, if you can find one, will not be just words. He will shower you with all his love, with all his grace, with all his flowers of silence and peace.\nOne of the ancient seers of the UPANISHADS has a very strange blessing for couples who come to him: \"I bless you, that you will have ten children, and finally the husband will become your eleventh child.\" It looks absurd -- what kind of blessing is this? But I feel that the man had a great insight.\nThe growth of love should finally be so cool, so passionless that the husband becomes almost a child to the wife, because a woman is intrinsically a mother. In real love, the woman functions as a mother, even to the husband. How they can hate? But it rarely happens, and as the world has gone farther and farther away from their own selves and silence and peace and coolness, their life as husband and wife has also gone in the same way.\nSo when I am talking, I am talking not about the exceptions -- now, people like you are exceptions -- I am talking about the general rule. But it is good that you ask the question; it makes my answer complete. I have talked about the majority; now, I am talking about a very small minority in the world -- they are the true\nlovers. Their love knows no friction, but only deep understanding of each other. So don't be worried about what I have been saying about the majority, about the world at large. You don't have to follow; you are perfectly going right.\nBennett's Accidental Discovery says: First, most auto accidents are caused by people with driver's licenses, so I tore up my license. Secondly, according to the latest statistics, most auto accidents happen within eight miles of your own home, so I moved.\nDon't be stupid about these statistics, and about these accidents. Just watch your own inner feeling. If you are feeling happy with your cool and silent, without- any-conflict love, you need not start being childish, immature. You don't have to follow others.\nThe people who are fighting with their spouses are really very repressed people; their repression is great. All the religions and all the cultures and all the educational institutions are repressing people, teaching them to repress sex. Repressed sex is very poisonous, because then it will not be satisfied with one woman or with one man. That is really the cause of fight, the cause of all jealousies, the cause of making spouses into KGB agents. They are watching each move of the other person.\nThe husband cannot even look at a beautiful woman passing by if the wife is with him, because even looking at her is going to cause immense trouble at home. It is strange. If you love your wife and your wife loves you, and you see a beautiful flower or a beautiful face or a beautiful moon, there is no difference. But because of repressedness, the wife knows the husband would like to have as many women as possible; she has to be on guard. And because the husband knows his repression, he is aware that wife is also repressed in the same way.\nI have heard about a big computer they have invented in New York which answers your questions. A boy went and asked, \"Can you tell me where my father is?\"\nAnd the computer said, \"Your father has gone fishing.\"\nThe boy laughed. He said, \"This is absolutely wrong. My father has been dead for three years.\"\nThe computer laughed and said, \"My son, that was the husband of your mother who died three years ago. Your father has gone fishing!\"\nBut this goes on happening because for thousands of years so much sexuality is repressed that it is not possible to be satisfied with one woman, with one man. There is no basic difference, and the moment you put the light off any woman is the same, any man is the same. Small details may be different, but the repressed desire is discontented. A humanity without any sexual repression will not have this kind of relationship which is continuously nagging, fighting, harassing each\nother.\nThis is the greatest psychological problem facing humanity: how to get rid of the repression that religions have planted in everybody's unconscious. It has gone so deep in the bones, in the blood, in the marrow, that one existentialist philosopher has said, \"I would like to make love to all the women of the earth; still, I cannot say I would be satisfied.\" He is saying something true, sincerely true. And he is saying something not only about himself, he is saying it about all human beings, men and women both.\nBut this is madness. You don't say, \"I will not feel satisfied unless I have eaten apples from every tree of the world.\" That kind of statement will not be relevant at all. But the existentialist philosopher's statement has a relevance; he is saying something true. That does not mean that he does not love, but his love is not capable to remove the deep-rooted, repressed sexuality; it is not enough. He wants more, and he wants change.\nThese are the reasons of conflict. You are fortunate if your life has been moving like a silent river without any unnecessary conflict, friction; otherwise there are everyday scenes, and this continues all your life.\nI have heard that ninety-year-old Herbie, who tried to seduce a fifteen-year-old girl was arrested for assault with a dead weapon!\nIt is saddening. Ninety years old and you are not beyond sex, you are not beyond childish things; it is because of repression.\nMan has to be completely released from all kinds of inhibitions and repressions, and love will become a very silent and cool affair.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nPASSING THROUGH THE GATE OF THIS MANDIR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN\nEIGHT YEARS, I FELT A KIND OF FRAGRANCE WHICH HAS STAYED WITH\nME EVER SINCE. IS IT POSSIBLE TO TAKE THIS FRAGRANCE WITH ME\nWHEN I LEAVE?\nOH, BELOVED MASTER, IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL, AND I AM SO GRATEFUL TO\nSPEND THIS TIME WITH YOU, EVEN IF I CANNOT TAKE THIS FRAGRANCE\nWITH ME.\nPrem Maharaj, the fragrance that you have felt in this temple of seekers is not something that you can leave behind. This fragrance contains love, meditativeness, silence, trust, life-affirmative values, a song of gratitude, a dance with the trees and with the stars...\nThis fragrance is an experience of a totally new atmosphere that does not exist in the outside world. If you meditate, you will become the same temple. Then, wherever you go the fragrance will go with you like a shadow; even others will feel it.\nIt is not the first time that such a question has come to me. The moment they enter the gate many people have felt suddenly, as if they are entering into another world -- the air is different, the vibe is different -- as if they have come home. And there is bound to be a certain fragrance, because so many people are meditating, and slowly, slowly their inner-being flowers are opening. The whole purpose of all these people to be here is absolutely different from any gathering anywhere outside in the world.\nThese are the people who are in search of the essential, existential life source. They are at different stages of evolution in consciousness, but they are all radiating something of higher stages. So when you enter the temple, you will find the air is different, the trees are different, the people are different. And if you also become a meditator, as I know you are becoming, this fragrance will start coming from within your own being. Even others may feel it wherever you go.\nI want my sannyasins... I have taken away the clothes which made them distinct;\nI have taken away their malas. But still people feel that they look a little different from others; still the airport officers catch hold of them! In Indian embassies when they go for a tourist visa, they immediately get the idea that they are going to Poona; Poona has become synonymous with my name. And many sannyasins have wondered -- they are not wearing the orange, they are not wearing the mala\n-- how they have become suddenly suspicious?\nA sannyasin will have a certain fragrance, a certain style, a certain way which is subtle; it may not be very apparent to the eyes, but it can be detected.\nI would like you to be known as separate from the crowds, not by your clothes not by anything outer, but just by your very being -- your silence, your peace, your love, your eyes.\nEvery gesture of you should declare that you are a sannyasin.\nOne day the pope gets a phone call from God. God says to him, \"Since you have been such a good pope, I wanted you to be the first to know.\"\n\"The first to know what?\" asks the pope.\nGod says, \"I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is that from now on, the world will have only one religion.\"\n\"That's wonderful,\" says the pope. \"Now everyone will be at peace, and everyone will get along with one another -- that's great. But what is the bad news?\"\n\"In a few days,\" says God, \"you will be receiving a phone call from Ma Anando in Poona!\"\nThat one religiousness is not going to be Catholic or Christian. That one religiousness is going to be this fragrance, Prem Maharaj, that you have been feeling here. Once our people are ready, they will go on spreading it all over the world; it needs it tremendously.\nJust remember one thing: Never be miserly. Share your experiences here with me your silences of the heart, your flowering of the being. Go on sharing the song that you have heard here, that music that is all around you.\nSometimes I feel sad for a few people. One old sannyasin, Kabir, wrote a letter to me, saying \"Osho, I want to share what has happened to me in all these years living with you.\nBut can I talk about you without mentioning your name?\" This cowardliness should be dropped.\nI want you not to be sheep, but lions.\nI want you to roar about the experience, because the world is so deaf that unless you roar they won't pay any attention. And the moment you mention my name, even if they are dead, they will wake up! Without my name, they will feel goody-goody, and you will feel very goody-goody. But only with my name, will you be able to judge whether those people have any intelligence, any awareness, any understanding, or whether they are just mediocre people with prejudiced minds.\nShare without being miserable, without being miserly, and share with authority. You have nothing to lose.\nIt is a tremendous challenge to change this whole earth into a paradise, but you will not be able to do that if you are cowardly or miserly. There are many sannyasins who remain silent and don't share just out of the fear that they may be condemned: \"You have also fallen from the traditional religion, from the convention,\" they simply remain quiet.\nThat's not right; that is not compassionate. That is cruel. If you know something, share it for two reasons, because the humanity needs it, and the second reason is that the more you share, the more you will have of it.\nMacTavish, O'Rourke and Hymie Goldberg were mourning the loss of a mutual friend.\nMacTavish said, \"As you well know, my friends, I am a thrifty Scottish soul. But there is a legend in my family that if one places a wee bit of money in the casket so that it may be buried with the body, it will ease the way into the next world. For the sake of our friend, I will place ten dollars in the casket with him.\" And with a flourish, he released a ten dollar bill and let it flutter onto the dear departed's breast.\nO'Rourke had no intention of being outdone. \"Well,\" he said, \"this strikes me as near superstition, but I will also contribute that sum.\" And a second ten dollar bill joined the first on the dead man's breast.\nGoldberg said at once, \"Do you think I won't join in this kind deed?\" And whipping out his check book, he quickly made out a check for thirty dollars, placed it on the dead man's breast and took the two ten dollar bills as change!\nDon't be that miserly. Share with your full heart, because it is not only for the benefit of the other, it is also for the benefit of your own being. The more you share, the more open you will become. Your sharing is not a loss. In the ordinary world of economics, if you give things to people, you lose them.\nI have heard...\nA man stopped his car by the side of a beggar. He was in a good mood; he had won a lottery. He was surprised by the beggar, because his clothes were very costly, although very old and dirty and rotten, and his face also looked cultured, educated. But life had been hard -- it seems he belonged to a very good family, and some calamity had happened. He stopped his car; he was in a good mood, took out a ten rupee note and gave it to the beggar, and the beggar laughed.\nThe man said, \"Why are you laughing?\"\nThe beggar said, \"I am laughing because this is the way I finished all my money, my whole heritage that my father has left. I also used to have a beautiful car, but I was giving to everybody -- whoever needed. I laughed, because if this is the way you are also going, soon you will be standing by my side.\"\nIn ordinary economics, when you give things you lose. But in the spiritual world laws change. There, if you DON'T give you lose: if you keep your doors and windows closed, your blissfulness, your silence, all become stale. But if you go on sharing, fresh waters will be coming from the eternal sources of life, and your blissfulness will remain always fresh and fragrant. And it will go on growing wider and wider.\nAs far as I am concerned this is the only real charity, to share your innermost treasure with people, familiar or strangers, and to turn their eyes also inwards. Because seeing your treasure, they will be reminded of their own treasures. Experiencing your fragrance, you will be putting them on the search of how they\ncan also be so fresh, so fragrant, so graceful. From where can they get this beauty that does not belong to the world, this music without instruments, and this poetic atmosphere without words?\nSharing with people is putting them on the right way: in search. And if they know what happens to the real seeker, they will not go on any wrong path.\nThe Indian constitution says three things are charitable: giving to the poor, making hospitals for the sick, opening schools for the uneducated. It is a shame that this should be the only kind of charity mentioned in the constitution of a country which knows far higher realms of charity. The constitution was written by people who had no idea -- they were politicians. They could not conceive that there can be some higher charity.\nTo me these are good but not great. The constitution would have been far richer if it had mentioned sharing your spiritual experiences with those who are poor in spiritual experiences.\nI have been fighting for years with the Indian government. They are not ready to believe that this institution is a charitable institution, and they cannot understand that there are deeper treasures, higher consciousnesses, and those who don't have them -- they are poor.\nSharing your spirituality, sharing your meditation, sharing your love at least should have been mentioned in the constitution, particularly of a country which has been for centuries the land which has attracted seekers from all over the world. But this constitution was not written by seers or enlightened people, but by those third-rate politicians, those dwellers of the gutter. They cannot see anything more than the fragrance they feel in the gutter; that is the only fragrance they know of.\nI would like you not to be bothered by constitutions and other things. You have to understand the higher economics: share so that you can have more.\nOkay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.\nThe Invitation\nChapter #21\nChapter title: To know oneself and to be oneself 31 August 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium Archive\ncode:\n8708315\nShortTitle:\nINVITA21\nAudio:\nYes Video:\nYes Length:\n87\nmins Question 1\nBELOVED OSHO,\nCAN YOU PLEASE SPEAK ON DISCIPLINE AND MEDITATION?\nNiten, it is a very strange question because every day, morning and evening, I am speaking on discipline and meditation. If anybody reads your question, he will think that for the first time I have to speak on discipline and meditation! Where have you been for so long?\nYou remind me of two old friends; they meet on a street in Leningrad... \"How is life treating you,\" asks one.\n\"Just great,\" replies the other.\nThe first one looks at him dubiously and says, \"Have you been reading the papers?\"\n\"Of course,\" replies the other, \"how else would I know!\"\nPeople know about their own lives by reading newspapers, and I have been telling you every day about meditation and nothing else, and you are asking...!\nOkay...\nA little old Jewish lady sits down on a plane next to a big Norwegian. She keeps staring and staring at him. Finally she turns to him and says, \"Pardon me, are you Jewish?\"\n\"No,\" he replies. A few minutes go by and she looks at him again and says, \"You can tell me -- you are Jewish, aren't you?\"\nHe answers, \"Definitely not.\"\nShe keeps studying him, and says again, \"I can tell you are Jewish!\"\nIn order to get her to stop annoying him, the gentleman says, \"Okay, I am Jewish.\"\nShe looks at him and shakes her head back and forth and says, \"Really, you don't look it!\"\nI am wondering from where to begin! Niten, meditation is the only contribution the East has made to humanity. The West has made many contributions, thousands of scientific inventions, immense progress in medicine, unbelievable discoveries in all the dimensions in life. But still, a single contribution of the East is far more valuable than all the contributions of the West.\nThe West has become rich; it has all the technology to be rich. The East has\nbecome poor, immensely poor, because it has not looked for anything else except for one thing, and that is one's own inner being. Its richness is something which cannot be seen, but it has known the highest peaks of bliss, the greatest depths of silence. It has known the eternity of life; it has known the most beautiful flowering of love, compassion, joy. Its whole genius has been devoted to a single search -- you can call it ecstasy.\nMeditation is only a technique to reach to the ecstatic state, to the state of divine intoxication. It is a simple technique, but the mind makes it very complex. Mind has to make it very complex and difficult, because both cannot exist together.\nMeditation is the death of the mind.\nNaturally, mind resists every effort for meditation. And if you go on without listening to the mind... It is clever and cunning enough to give you false directions and call them meditation.\nJust today I was informed about one of the people who has been for many years a disciple of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. He is now here meditating, but he continues his master Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's meditation too.\nWhat Maharishi Mahesh Yogi calls transcendental meditation is neither transcendental nor meditation. It is a mind trick. Just one thing is missing in it -- I have been telling you about the monkey -- and the person who is here should remember it! Transcendental meditation works only if you don't remember the monkey. So from tomorrow morning, be careful! The slightest remembrance of the monkey, and transcendental meditation is meaningless.\nIn fact, after eighteen years being with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and doing his transcendental meditation, what is the need to come here? But mind is so cunning that he is consoling himself that perhaps it is his master, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who has sent him here. But why should he send you here? I don't consider that he knows anything at all about meditation. What Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is teaching in the name of meditation has been known for centuries in the East by almost everybody that it is a psychological trick. It is not harmful. On the contrary, it can give you a little rest; it can give you a good feeling as if you have taken a shower. But it is not meditation, because it cannot take you beyond the mind.\nAny effort made by the mind cannot take you beyond the mind. This is a very\nfundamental rule to remember. The so-called transcendental meditation is just an example. There are many of the same kind prevalent all over the East, but they don't bring enlightenment. They don't bring awakened consciousness and that is the only criterion to decide whether they are right or not. A tree is known by its fruits, and a technique is known by what it achieves.\nTranscendental meditation is representative of all the meditations which mind has suggested to you; it is a cunning way to take you astray. Mind remains safe, not only safe, but becomes stronger. All these techniques are of concentration. You concentrate on some word, holy word -- the name of God, or any mantra -- and you repeat it as fast as you can, just inside your mind. The faster you can do it the better; the speed helps two things. The mantra or the name of God -- even your own name will do; it has nothing to do with God -- any meaningless word will do because the technique depends on something else. It depends on fast repetition, so fast that there are no gaps left in between.\nBecause there are no gaps, thoughts cannot arise; thoughts need a little space.\nThis is one thing: that you go on repeating a word faster and faster, and as you go on doing it for years, you really become an expert. So one thing it does is that it does not give a chance for any idea to enter into your mind. The second, more fundamental thing it does is that it creates tremendous boredom. Obviously, anything continuously repeated is going to create boredom, and boredom is the basis of auto-hypnosis.\nWhen you become bored, you start falling into a sleep, which is not exactly sleep because it is deliberately created; hence it has a different name -- hypnosis. Hypnosis means sleep, with a difference, that it is deliberate.\nSleep comes naturally -- on its own, spontaneously. Hypnosis is deliberate sleep\n-- you create a situation in which it is bound to happen. This deliberate sleep is immensely healthy, and even ten or fifteen minutes in a hypnotic state gives you a good relaxation which hours of ordinary sleep cannot give. And when you come out of it, you will feel very fresh.\nI absolutely agree that if you are doing it only for this purpose -- relaxation, a freshness comes, but it never takes you beyond the mind. How can it take you beyond the mind, because mind itself is repeating? By repetition, it does not need to think; repetition itself becomes a substitute for thoughts. And by\nrepetition it falls into a deep sleep -- dreamless sleep, which gives you immense freshness, rejuvenation.\nNaturally, you can be deceived that this is meditation -- you can go on doing it your whole life. It is healthy, it is good, it is nourishing, but it is not meditation.\nMeditation starts by being separate from the mind, by being a witness. That is the only way of separating yourself from anything. If you are looking at the light, naturally one thing is certain, you are not the light, you are the one who is looking at it. If you are watching the flowers, one thing is certain, you are not the flower, you are the watcher.\nWatching is the key of meditation:\nWatch your mind.\nDon't do anything -- no repetition of mantra, no repetition of the name of God -- just watch whatever the mind is doing. Don't disturb it, don't prevent it, don't repress it; don't do anything at all on your part. You just be a watcher, and the miracle of watching is meditation. As you watch, slowly, slowly mind becomes empty of thoughts; but you are not falling asleep, you are becoming more alert, more aware.\nAs the mind becomes completely empty, your whole energy becomes a flame of awakening. This flame is the result of meditation. So you can say meditation is another name of watching, witnessing, observing -- without any judgment, without any evaluation. Just by watching, you immediately get out of the mind.\nThe watcher is never part of the mind and as the watcher becomes more and more rooted and strong, the distance between the watcher and the mind goes on becoming longer and longer. Soon the mind is so far away that you can hardly feel that it exists... just an echo in faraway valleys. And ultimately, even those echoes disappear. This disappearance of the mind is without your effort, without your using any force against the mind -- just letting it die its own death.\nOnce mind is absolutely silent, absolutely gone, you cannot find it anywhere. You become for the first time aware of yourself because the same energy that was involved in the mind, finding no mind, turns upon itself. Remember: energy is a constant movement.\nWe say things are objects, and perhaps you have never thought why we call things objects. They are objects because they hinder your energy, your consciousness. They object; they are obstacles. But when there is no object, all thoughts, emotions, moods, everything, has disappeared. You are in utter silence, in nothingness -- rather in nothingness; the whole energy starts turning upon itself. This returning energy to the source brings immense delight.\nJust the other day, I quoted William Blake, \"energy is delight.\" That man, although he is not a mystic, must have found some glimpse of meditation. When meditation comes back to its own source, it explodes in immense delight.\nThis delight in its ultimate state is enlightenment.\nAnything that helps you to go through this process of meditation is discipline: perhaps taking a good bath, being clean and cool; sitting in a relaxed posture with eyes closed, neither hungry nor overloaded; sitting in a posture which is most relaxing... having a look at the whole body, every part and whether there is any tension. If there is any tension, then change the posture and bring the body into a relaxed state.\nIn the East it has been found, and found rightly, that the lotus posture -- the way you must have seen the statues of Buddha; that is called the lotus posture... It has been a discovery of thousands of years that that is the most relaxed state of the body. But for Westerners who are not accustomed to sitting on the ground, the lotus posture is a nightmare! So avoid it, because it takes almost six months to learn the lotus posture; it is not necessary.\nIf you are accustomed to sitting on a chair, you can find a way, a posture, a chair made in a certain way that helps your body to relax all its tensions. It does not matter whether you are sitting in the chair or in the lotus posture or lying down on the bed. Sitting is preferable because it will prevent you from falling asleep.\nThe lotus posture was chosen for many reasons. If one can manage it without torturing himself, then it is the best, but it is not a necessity. It is certainly the best situation in which you can enter into watchfulness. The legs are crossed, the hands are crossed, the spine is straight; it gives many significant supports to being watchful. First, in this position, gravitation has the least effect on the body because your spine is straight. So the gravitation can effect a very small portion. When you are lying down, gravitation effects your whole body. That's why for\nsleeping, lying down is the best posture. Gravitation pulls the whole body, and because of its pull, the body loses all tensions. Secondly, when you are lying down, if the purpose is to sleep then you should use a pillow because the less blood reaches to your mind, the less the mind will be active. The less blood reaches to the mind, the more possibility to fall asleep.\nA lotus posture is a great combination. It has the least effect of gravitation, and because the spine is straight a lesser amount of blood reaches to the mind, so mind cannot function. In that posture you cannot fall asleep easily. And if you have learned the posture from your very birth, it becomes so natural. The crossing of the legs, the crossing of the hands have a significance. Your body energy moves in a circle; the circle is not broken anywhere in a lotus posture. Both your hands... one hand gives the energy to the other hand; your one foot gives energy to the other foot -- and the energy goes on moving in a circle. You become a circle of your bio-energy.\nMany things are of much help. Your energy is not being released so you don't get tired.\nYour blood is reaching in a lesser amount so the mind does not function too much. You are sitting in such a position -- your legs are locked, your hands are locked and your spine is straight -- sleep is difficult. These are just supports; they are not essential.\nIt is not that one who cannot sit in a lotus posture cannot meditate, meditation will be a little difficult but the lotus posture is only helpful, not absolutely needed. And for the people from colder countries where sitting on the ground is not possible -- their bodies for centuries; their parents and their parents' parents from Adam and Eve... Have you seen any picture of Adam and Eve sitting in a lotus posture? In fact, it would have been very good for them, because sitting in lotus posture they could sit naked and yet nobody would have been very much aware of their nakedness. That's how the Jaina monks sit, always in lotus posture. You cannot see their genitals. Their legs are crossed, their hands are crossed; this functions almost as a protection for their nakedness.\nBut if for centuries people have never sat, then it will unnecessarily create trouble; your body structure has taken a certain mode. It is better to follow the body and its wisdom: use a chair. The whole thing is you should be comfortable so that the body does not draw your attention. That's why tension has to be\navoided, because if you have a headache then it will be difficult to meditate. Again and again, your attention will go to the headache. If your leg is hurting, or if there is any slight tension anywhere in the body, it immediately alarms you. It is natural and it is part of the body's wisdom.\nIf it does not alarm you then there is danger: a snake may be biting you, and you may go on sitting; your clothes may catch fire, your body may be burning, and you may not be aware of it. So the body immediately alarms wherever there is any trouble. That's the reason to create a relaxed position in which the body need not alarm you, because every alarm will be a disturbance in your meditation.\nSo the first thing of discipline is a relaxed body and closed eyes, because if you have open eyes, then so many things are moving around, they can be a disturbance. It is perfectly right for the beginners to use a blindfold, so that you are completely inside, because it is your eyes, your senses that take you outside. Eyes take eighty percent of all your outgoing contact -- eighty percent is through the eyes, so close the eyes.\nFor the beginners, it is good if they can use earplugs. Close the ears so no noise from the outside disturbs you. It is only for the beginners; all the precautions are for the beginners.\nAnd then just watch your mind as if the mind is nothing but a traffic of thoughts or a film\n-- a movie passing on the TV screen. You are just a neutral observer.\nThis is the discipline. And if this discipline is complete, watching comes very easily, and watching is meditation. Through watchfulness mind disappears, thoughts disappear. And that moment is the most blessed moment: when you are fully awake and there is not a single thought, just a silent sky of your inner being.\nThis is the moment when energy turns inwards; the turning-in is sudden, abrupt. And as the energy turns inwards, it brings immense delight, orgasmic delight. Suddenly your awareness becomes so rich because the energy is nourishment to your awareness. The energy coming back creates almost a flame of your being. You see all around pure light, silence -- utter silence, and an immense centering.\nYou are now at your very center.\nAt the right moment, when you are exactly centered -- the explosion. That explosion, we call enlightenment. This enlightenment brings you all the treasures of the inner world, the whole splendor. It is the only miracle in the world: to know oneself and to be oneself, and to know that one is deathless, one is beyond the body, beyond the mind; one is just pure consciousness.\nSo the discipline is just a support, the essential thing is witnessing, watching -- that is meditation. But in the name of meditation, there are hundreds of so-called teachers who go on exploiting people. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi became well known in the West, because the West was not aware that in the East, even the villagers are doing the so-called transcendental meditation. Everybody chanting, repeating the name of God -- it is an enjoyable exercise. I am not against it; it is perfectly good, but don't call it meditation and don't call it transcendental. Those are wrong words for it.\nIt is hypnotic auto-suggestion and nothing more. It will never give you the light that Kabir talks of, \"As if thousands of suns have arisen all around.\" It will not give you what Rumi calls as if the whole sky is showering flowers, and the whole being is filled with perfume, unearthly, not of this world.\"\nIt will not give you the ecstasy that Patanjali, the founder of Yoga, continuously insists on in his yoga sutras. He says that samadhi, ecstasy is very similar to sleep with only one difference that it is alert. If sleep can be awake, if sleep can be full of awareness, then it is samadhi, it is ecstasy. It will never give you the buddha nature. It gives you ordinary mental rest -- physical relaxation; hence, I am not against it.\nWhatever Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and other people like him are doing is good, but they are calling something meditation which is not. That's where they are leading people astray. If they had remained sincere and authentic and told people that this will give you mental health, physical health, a more relaxed life, a more peaceful existence, it was right. But once they started calling it transcendental meditation they have raised a very trivial thing to an ultimate significance which it cannot fulfill. People have been in transcendental meditation for years, and in the East, for thousands of years. But that has not become their self-knowing, and that has not made them Gautam Buddhas.\nIf you want to understand exactly what meditation is Gautam Buddha is the first man to come to its right, exact definition -- that is witnessing. Learn from\nGautam Buddha witnessing, and learn from Patanjali the discipline that can be helpful for meditation. This way, yoga and mediation can become a synthesis. Yoga is a discipline, just an outer support -- immensely helpful but not absolutely needed. And Gautam Buddha has given to the world the very fundamental and the most essential thing: witnessing as meditation.\nNiten, your question will not be solved until you start on the path a little bit; otherwise, you will ask again, \"What is meditation?\" Just my explaining it to you is not enough; you will have to move on the path.\nHymie and Becky Goldberg are about to take their first flight on an airliner. Hymie spends a while enjoying his comfortable, reclining seat and watching the pretty stewardess walking up and down the aisle. Next he looks out of the window and says excitedly, \"Becky, look at those people down there, they look like ants.\"\nBecky leans over, has a look and then says, \"They are ants, you idiot... we haven't left the ground yet!\"\nHymie Goldberg was so interested in watching the pretty girls going up and down the aisle, he had completely forgotten that the airplane was still standing -- it had not moved!\nSo looking at the ants, he thought they must be people from such a height. That's why you meditate with closed eyes!\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nHOW YOU TALK ABOUT THE SAME OLD THINGS DAY AFTER DAY AND YET\nPRODUCE A NEW REVELATION WITH EACH SENTENCE IS TO ME THE\nGREATEST MIRACLE IN EXISTENCE. WOULD YOU CARE TO COMMENT, PLEASE?\nVeena, it is very simple. First, because I have nothing to say, so I am free to say\nanything.\nI don't know what is going to be my next sentence; hence, it is not a burden or a trouble; it is spontaneous. I am not an orator who has to practice and rehearse. I love people, and I love to share my experience with them. I don't remember the past; hence, it is very difficult for me to repeat it. And because I look more at the questioner than his question...\nand all questioners are different; their questions may be almost the same. Looking at the questioner, my answer changes, I respond to the person. I don't have any doctrine to preach, so I don't have to be consistent. I enjoy absolute freedom.\nIn the past history of mankind, only poets have been given a certain license that they can use a little bit of freedom not to bother about the grammar and the language and the rules and the regulations. They had to be given that much license, otherwise they could not have poetry. That is the difference between prose and poetry: prose has to follow rules, regulations, grammar, linguistics; poetry has a certain freedom. I am even using prose with absolute license, because I don't see there is any reason to follow any limits.\nAll that I know is if what I am feeling is conveyed to you, whether it is right grammar or wrong grammar, whether it is the right word or the wrong word, is irrelevant. If I have conveyed my joy, my love, my peace, my blissfulness to you, any word is right. And because I have so much overflowing experience of my being I can go on for a millennium talking about it -- from different aspects, different angles, different directions; it will remain inexhaustible.\nYou have heard speakers, orators; I don't belong to their category. I simply enjoy gossiping! It is not a gospel -- I am not serious about it. Seriousness to me is psychologically sick. Healthy people will not enjoy gospels; they are boring. And you can see in any church you will find people asleep. The Sunday sermon is a good morning nap; people go to the church for that good morning nap... no disturbance. And the sermon is almost the same, it helps sleep.\nI have heard that one great preacher was very much disturbed. He was a very learned rabbi. His trouble was that an old millionaire, who had contributed the most to the synagogue, used to sit just in front of him and sleep and snore loudly. It was not a trouble that he was snoring, it was a trouble because his snore\ndisturbed other sleepers! And his snore kept many other sleepers awake. That disturbed the preacher because that meant every Sunday you have to bring a new sermon -- people are awake.\nIt is a good agreement between preachers and their congregation, that the congregation will sleep and the preacher will preach. He can go on preaching the same thing every time. There is not much to preach either. In all the four gospels, it is only one story repeated four times, the same incidents reported by four journalists! And not very educated either! So what can the poor preachers do? What can the rabbis do?\nI have been looking through the TALMUD, and it is so tiring that anybody who suffers from sleeplessness, I suggest the TALMUD -- you can just manage two or three pages! It is so much nonsense, and on that nonsense rabbis go on interpreting, interpretations upon interpretations. And the original is basic rubbish. I have always suspected because the namèrabbi' seems to be so close tòrubbish' that there must have been some past connection between rubbish and rabbi!\nBut somehow the rabbi had to stop that old man -- and he found a way. He used to come with his grandchildren -- a little boy, sometimes a little girl -- but he always used to bring a little child with him. The rabbi one day took the child aside and said, \"Listen, my boy, if you can keep your grandpa awake, particularly when he starts snoring -- you can nudge him -- I will give you four annas.\"\nThe boy said, \"Settled!\"\nAnd the next sermon day it was really great; the boy did not allow the old man to snore.\nThe moment he would snore, the boy would nudge him.\nThe old man was amazed, \"What has happened?\" The boy had never done such a thing before... always sitting silently. Outside he asked, \"What is the matter?\"\nThe boy said, \"Nothing is the matter. I am getting four annas to keep you awake, because your snoring is disturbing the whole congregation.\"\n\"Who is giving you four annas?\" the old man asked. \"I will give you eight annas\nif you sit silently and don't disturb my snoring.\" The boy said, \"That's perfectly good -- agreed!\"\nNext time the rabbi looked again and again at the boy, and the boy started looking downwards, and the old man was snoring. And the rabbi said, \"What is the matter?\" He many times made the indication, but the boy would not look at him at all. He continued to look downward. After the sermon the rabbi took the boy aside, and said, \"You seem to be very cunning. Have you forgotten?\"\nHe said, \"No, the old man is giving me eight annas not to disturb him.\" The rabbi said, \"I will give you one rupee.\"\nHe said, \"That's perfectly good -- promised.\"\nNext time he again started nudging the old man. The old man said, \"Have you forgotten?\"\nThe boy said, \"I have not forgotten. Now the rabbi is giving me one rupee, and business is business!\"\nA true Jew!\nI don't know what is going to come through me. I am almost a vehicle, I have left myself almost completely in the hands of existence. So whatever existence wants to convey to you, I am available. That's why I went on stopping many times because it is not in my hands, it is in the hands of existence. If something goes on flowing, it is okay -- and if it is nothing, I wait. I wait for existence to pick up the last thread.\nVeena, you say that it is the greatest miracle in existence. I can agree with you. I myself feel it, that either I am mad -- because for thirty years I have been continuously speaking, nonstop... Now I am speaking much less; otherwise five lectures per day had been my usual routine from morning till late night. Naturally, I thought either I am mad or it is a miracle. There are only two possibilities; I am happy with either!\nA Soviet citizen who was visiting the West was besieged by many questions from persons wanting to know more about communism.\n\"You mean to tell me,\" asked a curious host, \"that by being a communist, you share everything?\"\n\"Yes,\" came the reply.\n\"You mean,\" the host continued, \"if you had two houses you would give me one?\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"And if you had two cars, you would give me one?\" \"Certainly,\" replied the Russian.\n\"And if you had two stoves, or televisions, or refrigerators you would give me one of each?\"\n\"Naturally,\" said the Russian.\n\"And if,\" the host went on, \"you had two shirts, you would give me one?\" \"No,\" replied the communist emphatically.\n\"Why not?\"\n\"Because I have two shirts!\"\nVeena, I simply enjoy talking, just as I enjoy silence. I have to keep some balance. Most of the time I am silent, and then naturally, I have to take a little holiday from silence.\nThen I talk to my heart's content. I do only two things: I talk to you, and then I go to sleep! In the morning I wake up, I talk to you, and then I go to sleep. My twenty-four hours are divided into two things: talking and sleeping!\nMy sleep is my silence, my ecstasy, my samadhi. My talking is my sharing with you what I have found in my sleep!\nOkay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.\nThe Invitation Chapter #22\nChapter title: A sannyasin is never retired\n1 September 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium Archive\ncode:\n8709010\nShortTitle:\nINVITA22\nAudio:\nYes Video:\nYes Length:\n110\nmins Question 1\nBELOVED OSHO,\nTHIS QUESTION IS ASKED BY A TREMBLING HEART, WRITTEN BY A TREMBLING HAND. MY GRATITUDE FEELS SO INADEQUATE FOR YOUR\nGIFT. WHY DO I FEEL SO UNWORTHY OF YOU?\nVeet Vidhan, there are certain symptoms of falling in love. One of them is a feeling of unworthiness, because love is so vast, and you are so small. You cannot earn love, it comes on its own accord; suddenly it starts showering on you.\nNaturally, because you have not earned it, you cannot feel worthy of it. As love deepens, the feeling of unworthiness deepens. If a person in love does not feel it, that means the love is superficial, and the man has too big an ego. Only in that situation -- when your ego is too big, and your love is a superficial affair, not the great affair Ta Hui was talking about...\nBefore the great affair of love, it is absolutely necessary and inevitable, that one should feel unworthy. Nothing is wrong in it; it is exactly as it should be. Out of this unworthiness, slowly, slowly transformation happens. I can predict it will happen to you too, because your feeling of unworthiness is not just an intellectual question. Intellect never asks such questions; ego does not allow such questions; mind is not capable of asking such questions.\nMind and ego and intellect -- they all take it for granted whatever happens in their lives is not enough. They are worthy for more; hence the question cannot arise from those sources. The only source that remains is the heart, which is always true and always sincere. And once the heart starts feeling unworthy, it does not give a sadness to you but a gratefulness. Slowly, slowly unworthiness turns into gratitude: you are not worthy of something and it has been showering on you; you cannot even understand why existence has chosen you.\nOne of Gautam Buddha's disciples, Manjushri, became enlightened sitting under a tree.\nThe moment he became enlightened, suddenly flowers from the tree started showering on him. Those who were around, they could not believe what is happening. There was not any strong wind. There is no reason why so many flowers go on showering on Manjushri.\nHe was sitting silently with closed eyes; perhaps he was not even aware.\nThey reported to Gautam Buddha. He looked where Manjushri was sitting under a tree, and he said, \"He has become what his destiny was; he has come to his flowering. And not only is his inner being full of joy, even the tree is celebrating.\"\nThese kinds of stories for centuries had been taken as metaphors, poetry, beautiful anecdotes. But now we can say they are factually possible on scientific grounds. Trees are very sensitive, more sensitive than you are. They join you in your celebration; they join you in your mourning. Of course, you are not aware, but now scientists have found ways to figure it out. They have made a small instrument like a cardiogram, which is attached to the tree, and the cardiogram starts working, making the graph of the tree's sensitivity.\nWhen the tree is at ease, relaxed, the cardiogram makes the graph very symmetrical. If a woodcutter comes with his axe, with the idea to cut the tree... He has not started cutting and he has not even said that he is going to cut the tree, but if he has the idea, the tree is even sensitive to the idea. And suddenly the graph starts trembling just like your heart trembles... writing, your hand is trembling. The whole tree starts trembling deep down, and it can be caught on the graph. The graph is no longer symmetrical; it goes crazy.\nNot only is it that the tree which has to be cut becomes aware of your thought, your thought creates a vibration around you which a simple heart can catch hold of. Other trees surrounding the tree -- friends and companions which have been together for years, have joined in sadness when there was no rain, have joined when the rain comes and brings great joy and blessings. They have passed through many falls and seen themselves standing naked against the sky, and have seen many springs together when great foliage comes and when flowers start blossoming. A certain communion, a certain friendliness has arisen in them.\nSo it has been found that the tree which is going to be cut starts trembling, catches the thought. But other trees nearby also start trembling... just the idea that one of their old friends is going to be destroyed. Strangely enough, scientists have been shocked that it means trees are more sensitive than human beings: you don't know what thought is going on in the person who is sitting by your side; every mind is broadcasting its thoughts all around, and you are catching them but you are not aware.\nThey have tried bringing the same woodcutter again, but with no idea of cutting the tree.\nHe comes with his axe, the graph continues exactly the same, symmetrical, showing that the tree is not worried because there is no idea in the woodcutter's mind -- and the other trees also stop trembling. And when the gardener is\nbrought who has nourished those trees, cared for them, has loved them, in lonely moments has even talked with them... I had a gardener, an old man, a very beautiful man -- and he was not just professionally a gardener, he loved trees. I have seen him, when there was nobody and he thought nobody was watching him; I have seen him talk to the trees.\nOnce I caught hold of him, because he was continuously winning every year; almost five years he was with me and every year he was winning the corporation prize for bringing the biggest roses. I asked him, \"What is the matter; you talk with trees?\" He said, \"I love them, I feel them. I can\ntell you, but not anybody else, because I trust you will understand, that it is not one-sided; they also answer in some way or other. I have not been winning these prizes because I am a great gardener.\"\nThe city was big, and there were many millionaires in the city. They had great gardens and many gardeners. And they were all puzzled because they were all trying to win the prize, but this old man went on winning.\nHe said, \"It is just my talking to the trees, saying, `Don't forget in the right time to give me the biggest flower. It is a question of my prestige and your prestiges.'\" And he said to me, \"It has never failed. Those other gardeners are doing hard work with more manure, more chemicals. They are doing everything that the art of gardening will suggest, but this is beyond the art of gardening.\"\nAs the gardener is brought, all the trees feel so immensely happy that the symmetrical graph becomes almost a dance. Just as it has become crazy out of fear, so out of love it again becomes not the ordinary silent tree, but showing a tremendous joy as if the tree is jumping, dancing. And you can see the difference between the graphs. When the tree is afraid, the graph will show you that these lines are coming out of fear. And when the tree has suddenly seen the gardener who has taken care and grown it like his own children, the graph dances. And you can see in the graph that it is not out of worry, but out of a gratitude and out of a welcome -- a friend has come. And other trees also do the same.\nMan is capable of receiving immense joy if he only learns how to be grateful. So you are on the right path, Vidhan. But don't go on thinking in terms that you are unworthy, because that has to be transformed into gratitude. It is certain, nobody is worthy. What have you done to be alive? What have you done to have such\nbeautiful eyes? What have you done to have this potentiality of becoming a Gautam Buddha? You have not done anything; it is just coming out of the abundance of existence. Existence has so much that it has to share out of sheer necessity to unburden itself; it is overflowing. And if people remain thirsty, it is their own fault.\nThere is an ancient saying in India that you can remain thirsty standing on the bank of a river. Unless you learn how to bow down, fill your hands with water, the river is not going to jump towards you. It is available; just a little humbleness on your part, a little receptivity on your part, and you can quench your thirst.\nEverything that is great in life is abundantly available; just don't shrink in your unworthiness. It is a beautiful first step to experience it, but then for what are we worthy?\nNeither for life, nor for love, nor for this beautiful body -- we are not worthy for anything; we have just taken all this for granted. This is the irreligious mind.\nI don't call a man irreligious who does not believe in God. I don't call a man irreligious who does not go to the temples or churches. I don't call a man irreligious if he denies heaven and hell and all that nonsense. But I call a man irreligious if he does not feel unworthy of all that he has received and is receiving every moment. With every breath, with every heartbeat life is continuously giving you. The same life is capable of giving you immense blissfulness, of which you cannot even have an idea unless you have tasted it.\nJust change your unworthiness into gratefulness, into thankfulness. And to me, this kind of gratitude is the only true prayer. You don't have to say anything -- just the feeling of gratefulness that I don't deserve, I don't see why so much has been given to me and so much goes on showering on me. What can I do except be grateful?\nThis gratefulness should sink deep in your consciousness, in your very fibers and cells of body. You will simply become gratefulness, then it is prayer. And the things that are called prayer are just false. Millions of temples and churches and synagogues, and millions of people continuously praying... but their prayers are false because they are always asking for something. They are never thanking for what they have already received.\nIn their prayers if you look, you will find the beggar, the ungrateful beggar. And\nyou will also find in all the prayers of all the religions -- I have looked as deeply as possible into every religion -- there is a certain complaint that things are not as they should be: \"Others are getting more; I am not getting that much.\" These are not prayers, they are simply wasting their time. They have not even come to understand the meaning of prayer.\nIt is not in the words, it is prayerfulness. And prayerfulness means only one thing, and only one thing, gratefulness -- a gratitude that goes on sinking deep into your being for everything: for trees being green, for rain coming down to quench the thirst of the earth.\nAnd when the first rains come, the sweet smell coming from the earth is earth's gratitude.\nAnd the trees becoming green, and bringing millions of flowers, that is earth's thankfulness, that is earth's prayer. That's how you should be; that's how your prayer should be -- nothing but a gratefulness.\nSlowly, slowly man goes on forgetting what complaint is, what grudge is. As he becomes more attuned with gratefulness, he forgets completely that he has to ask for something.\nThings are coming without his asking. He has just to keep his doors open and the guest comes. He has just to wait, and wait lovingly, prayerfully.\nI am giving you the meaning of prayer in a way no religion has ever given it to humanity; their prayers are so childish, stupid. A gratefulness will make you more and more capable of receiving gifts.\nThe so-called religions that have overruled man's mind for centuries are mostly fictions. I have come across Albert Camus' very strange but beautiful and true statement: \"If God did not exist, we would have to invent him\" -- otherwise, to whom are you going to complain? on whose shoulders are you going to throw all your responsibilities? with whom are you going to be angry? who is going to be your security, safety...?\nCamus is saying something very important when he says that if God did not exist we would have to invent him, and if God did exist, we would have to abolish him. If God did exist why would we have to abolish him? -- because it would be intolerable. To be so grateful to him would look like humiliation: you are\nunworthy and he goes on giving to you -- you could not forgive him; he is insulting you, he is making you aware of your unworthiness.\nI have a friend who was at a time education minister. He used to come to me once in a while, and one day he told me something that he would not have told anybody: \"I have thought many times to bring it to your notice, but then I stopped myself. But there is a limit, I have to tell it to you.\" He was born a poor man, and he was adopted by a rich man, a very rich man, who had no children. So he suddenly rose from poverty to be a super-rich man.\nHe started giving money to his relatives who were poor, because he himself belonged to a poor family; his relatives were poor, his friends were poor. And now he had so much, and he had got it without any effort, and he was in a position to help everybody. He really helped all his relatives, his father, his brother, his sisters, his friends, and he made all of them very rich. I was aware of the fact.\nHe told me \"The problem is, I have been so generous to everybody who was even faraway connected -- a faraway cousin, or just an acquaintance -- but if I saw that they were in trouble, I gave them as much as they wanted; I gave them more. Now they are all flourishing, they are all rich. But one thing strange is that they don't feel obliged towards me! On the contrary, most of them never come to see me or meet me; in fact, they avoid me. It hurts me very much, that I have done so much... and what kind of ungrateful people are these?\"\nI said, \"You don't understand the deeper psychology behind it. You have given them, but you don't know that the giver always insults the person he is giving. In the very giving you have become higher and the person who has received has become lower. If you are an understanding man, you will see this is actually what happens. I want to ask you one thing: Have you ever accepted any help from them?\"\nHe said, \"I don't need it -- why should I accept their help?\"\nI said, \"That's where you are humiliating them, insulting them. What is wrong? -\n- small things. If you just phone a friend whom you have helped, who is now rich, has a factory of his own, cars of his own... if you just ask him, `Send two cars; I need them very much.'\nYou may not need, you have enough cars! Just let those cars come, and after an\nhour send them back. You don't need, but let that man feel that he can also give something to you, that he is not always on the receiving end. He is sometimes on the giving side also.\n\"Or you can tell some friend, Ìn your garden I saw such beautiful roses. Can you send me a dozen roses today?' And he will be immensely happy to send those dozen roses. It doesn't cost him much, but he will start forgiving you, and he will start being grateful to you.\"\nThe man said, \"Perhaps you are right. I have never, never asked anybody for anything, because I don't need. And I never thought that just giving to somebody, and always giving and never taking...\"\n\"Anything, anything without any value... a few flowers or just calling the person and saying, Ì am feeling very lonely. Can you come and be with me for breakfast or for the lunch? -- I will be immensely grateful.' You would have helped those people to regain their dignity. You have given them money but you have made them beggars, and nobody can forgive you, this is utterly inhuman.\"\nAnd he said, \"I understand, but I will not be able to do it; it is against my ego.\"\nI said, \"That is then absolutely clear why they are avoiding you: they know that you are giving to them, not because they are poor but because you are rich. You are not concerned with their problems and worries and difficulties. You are just exploiting their misery, their suffering, their poverty for your own ego fulfillment; Ì have been a great help.' And you are bragging continuously... How can they forgive you?\"\nThat's what Albert Camus means when he says that if God did exist and was available to humanity, we should have to abolish him because it would become intolerable: he goes on giving and he will not ask for anything from you because he has everything -- the whole belongs to him! He would take away all your dignity. You can forgive somebody for anything, but you cannot forgive anybody who destroys your dignity as a human being, who takes away your pride.\nFortunately, there is no God, and particularly for you. There are people who believe in God: deep down they are angry with him. They may pray and they may show their respect, but deep down they think, \"Why is my wife suffering from cancer? If God is compassionate, then where is his compassion? I have been praying for years, why am I poor? The people who never pray and never\ncome to the church or the temple or the synagogue are rich! I am honest and I am trying to be as sincere as human frailty will permit, but I remain poor, a failure, a nobody... and the people who are mean and cunning and can do anything to achieve power and money -- they are successful. The priests go on saying that God is just. Where is your justice?\"\nThese things go on remaining in your unconscious -- you may not say them because they may make God very angry. In fact, in the TALMUD, the Jewish God says exactly the words, \"I am a very angry God. I never forgive; never take me for granted.\" A very beautiful sentence is: \"I am not your uncle, remember.\" That is very Jewish, but their God is a Jew, you cannot do anything about it. He is reminding you, \"I am not your uncle, so don't expect any niceness from me. I am your father.\"\nYou know there is a difference between the father and the uncle: uncles are always friendly; fathers are authoritarian, powerful people; you belong to them. It is very rare to see a son and a father being friendly, trusting each other, telling each other their innermost thoughts and feelings. But you will always find people immensely friendly with their uncles. They will not say things to just anybody which they can say to their uncles; some different quality exists.\nSuch a God is not only Jewish, such a God is the God of all primitive people. In all primitive, holy scriptures he is very angry. If he was available in the world, Albert Camus is right, we would have to kill him. It would become intolerable -- his interference in everything, his commandments for everything, and his anger, and his violence, and his torture; his blackmailing that he will throw you into hellfire for eternity if you don't listen to him. And if you are obedient, in other words if you are just a slave, you will have all the joys of paradise. Such a God would not be tolerable, particularly to those who have some pride of being individuals. It will be easier to finish him.\nIn fact, Sigmund Freud sometimes comes to very great insights; he was certainly a genius. But unfortunately these people never came in contact with any meditation; otherwise they would have given the world tremendous contributions. Still, because of their genius they had glimpses and insights. One of his insights, which may not be factual is certainly psychological. The psychological is far more significant to understand than the factual, because the factual is ordinary, outside you; the psychological is within you and controls you.\nFreud says that people worship God as father because some time in the beginning they must have killed some dominant father, somebody who was too dictatorial. It is a well-known fact that many kings have been killed by their sons because the king was going on and on living. And the son was becoming old and it seemed that he was not going to live to be a king; the only possibility was the death of the father. Many kings have imprisoned their fathers and taken over the throne, because they saw that there seemed to be no possibility of his natural death -- at least while there was time to enjoy being a king!\nWhat would be the point when you are seventy-five or eighty when your father dies and you succeed? Within a year or two you would be gone too.\nThere is a possibility factually, but there is no historical record of it; hence, historians have rejected the insight. But I am not a historian and I think history is simply bunk! My concern with God is for psychological reasons.\nSigmund Freud says that because somewhere in the past man had to kill the father he felt the guilt of what he had done. And out of that guilt he started worshipping the ancestors, the fathers, the elderly people, the old people. All this respect has arisen out of a guilt which has settled in the human heart. Man started inventing a God as father, raising temples in his memory, statues, priests praying, worshipers worshipping.\nBehind this whole scene and drama of religion, Sigmund Freud finds only one single fact and that is: somewhere in the past man has behaved so badly with his father -- perhaps murdered -- that he cannot forgive him. So the only way is to pray, make God your father, the creator of the world. All these hypotheses... It was a very original insight.\nA man who has no guilt will not go to a church, will not go to a confessional in a Catholic church. For what? -- unless one enjoys talking about so-called sins...!\nI have heard...\nOne woman was coming every Sunday to the confessional, and confessing the same sin that she had been raped. The bishop said, \"That is not your sin, you don't have to confess it -- let the person who has raped you.\"\nShe said, \"But I enjoyed it! That's why I have to confess it. I pretended to resist, but deep down I enjoyed.\"\nThe priest said, \"Even if you enjoyed it, you have been forgiven. You have donated to the charity box, and I have prayed for you to God. And this is the third time... who is this man? Is he the same man raping again and again every week?\"\nShe said, \"I have to confess, he has raped me only once, and because I enjoyed it he did not bother to rape me again. He looked embarrassed... what is the point? In fact, he must have felt he had been raped, tricked. So I go into places where he hangs around; the moment he sees me, he escapes.\"\nBut the priest said, \"If it has happened only once then what is the point every week to come to the confession?\"\nShe said, \"I enjoy the idea and to tell you in detail. It is nothing to me -- ten dollars I can give as a punishment, and you can pray for my sin. But I enjoy even describing it.\"\nMy own feeling is that the number of people who confess in the Catholic church, most of them have not committed those sins. They simply enjoy the idea, \"I raped a woman.\"\nPerhaps they want to rape a woman, but it is a difficult job. But to confess is very simple, just ten dollars. And for ten dollars, enjoying the idea that I raped the woman... At least the priest is convinced and he will convince God too.\nSigmund Freud seems to me to be psychologically right; otherwise there would be no temples, no churches, no mosques, no gods. Man needed someone to pray to, needed someone to complain to, needed someone to throw all responsibility onto. But if he was available in the world, just in the M.G. market, he would have been killed -- and particularly in Poona.\nYou will be surprised to know that this M.G. Road is named after Mahatma Gandhi; M.G. is short for Mahatma Gandhi Road -- and Poona has killed, assassinated Mahatma Gandhi! The day a Poona-ite assassinated Mahatma Gandhi sweets were distributed and there was celebration. And now they are calling their main market M.G. market. This is the guilt that somehow has to be erased, so they have raised the statue to Mahatma Gandhi. Strange... you kill the man and then you raise the statue.\nYou must have seen on the hills, just nearby the bridge, there is one beautiful\nbungalow where Mahatma Gandhi used to stay. The people to whom that bungalow belongs used to come to listen to me in Bombay. And when I was moving to Poona, I said to those people, \"That bungalow is empty and that will be the best place for the ashram because of the hills around; the road goes round and round -- and the whole hill part belongs to the bungalow. For the ashram it will be perfect, and whatever your price...\nThey said, \"It is not a question of price, it is because Mahatma Gandhi used to stay there, so we have made it a memorial.\" Now it is a Mahatma Gandhi memorial -- there is a statue, there is a memorial.\nJust by the other side of the river there is one palace, Aga Khan Palace, where the British government used to imprison Mahatma Gandhi, as a special concession, because it is not a jail; it is a palace, it was used for Mahatma Gandhi. Whenever the government wanted to put him in jail the palace was used, and he was free to move in the gardens. He was provided with his secretaries, with his wife; he continued to function just as if he was outside. In fact, he was in a better position; outside he used to live in small huts because poverty was his philosophy. Here he was living in the Aga Khan's Palace, one of the most beautiful buildings in Poona, with a vast garden.\nHis wife died while he was in prison in the Aga Khan Palace. His wife's samadhi is in the Aga Khan Palace, so now the Aga Khan Palace has also become part of a memorial.\nBecause Mahatma Gandhi was imprisoned there and his wife died there... And it was a group of Hindu chauvinists of Poona who killed him. And now they are trying to somehow erase the guilt feeling -- making memorials, making statues, giving names to the streets.\nSigmund Freud is right in my understanding that man must have behaved badly in the past with their elders, particularly the fathers. And there is a possibility that fathers may have been killed, because they were holding all the power -- and all the power included all the beautiful women of the clan. The sons were young, they needed beautiful women; the father was old but he was holding all the beautiful women: unless he dies, there is no possibility for the young people to have those beautiful women, they were that old man's property.\nPsychologists have been trying to find the same pattern in monkeys. If you see\nmonkeys sitting on a tree, you will be surprised to know that on top is the oldest monkey, the most powerful monkey. He is the president! Nobody else will be allowed to sit on the top of the trees; that is a question of prestige and power. And around him are all the beautiful females. He is old but even the youngest females first have to be under his control. Then underneath that are other elders, and underneath that are the young people.\nNaturally, there is every possibility -- and it happens -- that the older monkey is killed by the younger monkey because he is taking away their whole life. He has lived enough and he goes on living -- and he is holding all the power. There is a deep will to power in everybody, and particularly the power over the females. Nobody can even look at those females while the old man is alive. They don't have any other money and treasure and kingdoms; their only property is the females. On this point of the females, many old monkeys are killed.\nPerhaps this discovery by the scientists led to the insight of Sigmund Freud that one day men killed their fathers -- had to kill, had to remove them, otherwise they wouldn't allow you to live at all.\nIf God did exist, it is absolutely certain he would have been assassinated -- it would have become absolutely intolerable. But fortunately, he does not exist so nobody can assassinate him. But unfortunately, people have created a hypothetical God which neither you can assassinate nor you can communicate with. It is a simple hypothesis, but still it helps people to get rid of their guilt.\nThe priest is the beneficiary; he keeps the hypothesis alive. He fights for the hypothesis, because all that comes to God as offerings to erase the guilt of people reaches the priest.\nSo the priest's whole work is to make more and more people guilty. This is a business and a very subtle structure: make people guilty about everything, every pleasure.\nIn Jainism, even to eat food tastefully is a sin; you should not eat tastefully. You can eat, but don't take the taste, don't enjoy it. That is possible only if your taste buds are operated on; otherwise it is not possible. Your tongue and your taste buds... and they are not many, they can be removed very easily. Then you won't taste anything. But that is not the idea.\nThe idea is that because of those taste buds you will have to taste and then you\nwill feel guilty. And once you are guilty, you are in the hands of the priest.\nNow sex is not in your hands. Feeling good and happy with a restful night is natural, but Jainism condemns it. Jaina monks should eat only one time a day, and that too, standing because being comfortably seated you can eat more; standing you will get tired yourself.\nAnd it looks so embarrassing -- a crowd, and you are standing, and you have to take your food in your hands.\nThe Jaina monk is not allowed to have anything as his possession. So how much can you take in your hands? -- and you cannot take twice. So they are hungry. To think of food or to think of women or to think of any pleasure is a sin -- even to think, even to dream. And I cannot conceive that a Jaina monk can avoid dreaming about food, or that so-called celibates -- Jaina, Catholics, Buddhists, Hindus -- can avoid dreaming about women?\nAnd the priests say that whether you dream or you actually act it does not matter: even to dream about good food is as sinful as actually eating it because the question is of your mentality; to dream about a beautiful woman is as sinful as having a beautiful woman.\nAll the religious priests for thousands of years have been managing to find all those areas where you are weak, where nature can be condemned. And you cannot do anything because it is a natural thing, so naturally, you will feel guilty.\nGuilt is the whole foundation of your religions.\nThe priest needs you to be guilty, and because of guilt you need God -- who is going to forgive you? What are your prayers? \"Forgive us, we are sinners and your compassion is great. Forgive us father.\" And there is nobody to listen to you!\nBecause God is just a hypothesis, assassination is not possible. You cannot find him anywhere. Albert Camus is right: if God did not exist, we would have to invent him.\nThat's what we have done, we have invented him. If God did exist we would have to abolish him. The existential problem is what I have told you, the feeling that I am unworthy.\nIt is true:\nNobody is worthy.\nWe have received everything for no reason at all.\nBeing grateful to existence is the only authentic religion, and it does not need to have an adjective to it -- Christian or Hindu or Mohammedan. It is simply gratefulness.\nVidhan, you are on the right track; just don't get stuck at unworthiness, that is one side of the coin. The other side of the coin is gratefulness. This is the negative side; that is the positive side.\nRemember, always to go with the affirmative, the positive, and you will never go astray.\nThe ultimate affirmation comes the day when you explode into light, into joy, into bliss, into song, into dance. All that will create more and more gratefulness in you.\nYou will become just a prayer. Question 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nTHE OTHER MORNING, WHEN YOU MENTIONED ABOUT A POCKET WATCH\nBEING THE LAST PRESENT FOR PEOPLE WHO RETIRE, I WAS AMAZED, BECAUSE WHEN YOU LEFT FOR AMERICA I WAS AT MY VILLAGE, AND I RECEIVED BY MAIL A UNIQUE PRESENT FROM YOU\n-- A VERY BEAUTIFUL\nSEIKO POCKET WATCH! I WAS DELIGHTED BY THIS RARE GIFT, BUT TODAY I FEEL A BIT SHAKY!\nBELOVED OSHO, COULD YOU PLEASE TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT\nTHE\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THIS GIFT?\nSardar Gurudayal Singh, I remember the pocket watch that I have sent you. I have been giving watches to hundreds of my sannyasins. The significance is simple, so you need not be worried by what I said yesterday.\nIt was not a retirement gift; a sannyasins is never retired! He becomes enlightened, but retirement is not possible neither before enlightenment nor after enlightenment.\nRetirement does not exist in the world of a sannyasin, so you can drop your fear and worry; it was not a retirement gift. I have been giving watches to many people because my whole message is: be watchful!\nSo don't misunderstand me...\nA man in New York for the weekend, struck up a conversation with a young lady in the bar. After a few drinks he suggested that they buy a bottle and go to his room; she agreed.\nWhen the girl began taking off her clothes, the man asked, \"Say, how old are you?\"\n\"Thirteen,\" she replied.\n\"Thirteen? Good Lord,\" said the man. \"Get your clothes back on and get out of here.\"\nAt the door the girl paused and said, \"Superstitious, eh?\"\nIn America, the number thirteen is very superstitious! You will find in hotels that after the twelfth storey comes the fourteenth. The thirteenth storey does not exist at all because nobody is ready to stay on the thirteenth floor.\nI have seen one book: a man had done great research work proving that this superstition of the number thirteen is not just superstition, it has a scientific background. I was very much amazed so I went through the book. It was sheer nonsense what he had done. He had collected the number of accidents which had\nhappened on the thirteenth date, the number of people who died on the thirteenth, the number of people who got cancer on the thirteenth... all kinds of calamities that happened on the thirteenth. He had collected such a list that anybody would be greatly impressed that certainly this number thirteen is dangerous.\nI wrote a letter to the man saying, \"Unless you do the same research for the eleventh and for the twelfth -- just two dates will do, one before thirteenth... and find out what happens on the twelfth, what happens on the eleventh, all the calamities... And unless you find that more accidents happen on the thirteenth than on the twelfth or eleventh, that more people die on the thirteenth than on any other date, your thesis is just nonsense. This way you can prove any date dangerous, because people are dying on every date, every day. There is no quota given for dates.\"\nI received a letter saying that the man had died; unfortunately he died on the eleventh!\nOne of his friends replied that the man himself had missed the thirteenth. But in America that superstition is very prevalent. People don't want the number thirteen on their car; they avoid the number thirteen in every way. In the army you won't find a soldier whose number is thirteen.\nSardar Gurudayal Singh, that retirement watch is also a superstition, but it is possible that whoever invented it first may have had some idea similar to me, that now a man is retiring, life is in a way finished. It is good to give him a watch because the days are few, time will be rushing by faster than ever. So it will be helpful to keep him alert, watchful.\nTime is not money, time is life, and to give a watch... Now it has become superstition nobody bothers what is the meaning. Nobody knows either the people who are giving or the person who is receiving... but just a golden pocket watch.\nBut when I have given watches -- and I go on giving -- that does not mean that you are retired. That does not mean that your days are finished, \"Just count the hours on your watch.\"\nIt means: Be watchful, be aware and alert.\nEvery moment is full of danger and full of ecstasy. If you can use it for awareness and watchfulness, it becomes a great ecstasy, the juiciest experience of life. But if you are not aware, some moment, some day, you are going to die...\nDon't die before destroying your ego.\nLet the ego die first so that you can realize your real immortal being.\nI have given it to you, Gurudayal, just to be watchful, because one can get into any trouble -- particularly a man like Gurudayal.\nA few days ago somebody came to me to inform me that Sardar Gurudayal Singh was going to marry Mukta. I said, \"I am telling enough jokes, and he is trying to be a practical joke!\" And Mukta is also great! She has found poor Sardar Gurudayal Singh. He is a rare man, a happy man, but to find him for marriage...! And he is such a fellow he will not say no. He has known life in many colors: he has been in the army, he has fought in the wars; he has been my bodyguard for many years, and he is of a simple and innocent heart. If somebody approaches him for marriage at this age, he will say okay.\nSomehow I have persuaded Mukta not to do such a thing, because he is living a free life.\nHe has divorced his wife long, long ago; he has not a single worry in the world. He is one of my most profound sannyasins -- poor, but immensely rich because he can laugh more beautifully than anybody else. I don't have to know where he is sitting. When he starts laughing I know because his laughter, even in his old age, comes louder than anybody else's.\nNo need to worry about that watch! Just be watchful; don't get into any trouble. Now, getting married to Mukta... You will be in trouble; she will be in trouble. She is enjoying fully. She has divorced her husband long ago; you have divorced your wife -- both are free. But I must say that Mukta has an eye to find a real man!\nTwo jokes for Sardar Gurudayal Singh...\n\"You will be poor and unhappy until you are forty,\" said the fortune-teller to her customer.\n\"Then what?\" asked the worried customer.\n\"Well, by then you will be used to it,\" the fortune-teller replied!\nA man approaching retirement went along to see the company doctor for one final checkup. To his horror the doctor said, \"I don't know quite how to put this, but your heart is on its last legs and you have only got six months to live.\"\n\"Is there nothing I can do?\" asked the shocked man.\n\"Well,\" said the doctor, \"you can give up alcohol, and cut out smoking. Don't eat rich foods, no dancing, and don't even think about sex!\"\n\"And this will make me live longer?\" the man asked hopefully. \"No,\" replied the doctor, \"it will just seem longer!\"\nOkay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.\nThe Invitation Chapter #23\nChapter title: What kind of vehicle are you using 1 September 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium Archive\ncode: 8709015\nShortTitle: INVITA23\nAudio:\nYes Video:\nYes Length:\n101\nmins Question 1\nBELOVED OSHO,\nHEARING YOU SPEAK THE OTHER MORNING, IT FINALLY CAME TO MY\nCONSCIOUSNESS THAT I AM SEXUALLY REPRESSED.\nI CAN'T REMEMBER BEING SEXUALLY REPRESSED BEFORE THE AIDS\nSCARE STARTED. ALSO, BEING REJECTED SEXUALLY BY A BOYFRIEND\nHAS CONTRIBUTED; ALTHOUGH I SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT --\nOR TRY TO.\nI CAN REMEMBER A TIME WHEN, WITH NO BOYFRIENDS, I WOULD FEEL\nMY SEXUAL ENERGY AND YET IT WOULD NEED NO OUTLET. IT WOULD\nSTAY IN MY BODY AND I WOULD FEEL ORGASMIC ALL OVER.\nBUT NOW I FEEL IMPRISONED BY REPRESSED SEX AND NEED YOUR\nGUIDANCE.\nPrem Shunyo, you are simply confused. You are not sexually repressed. You are simply an English lady. It seems you had forgotten it.\nJust a few days ago a drunkard was arrested in France. He was making love to a dead woman on the beach. When asked, he said, \"I thought she is English.\"\nDon't be worried about repression. And moreover you are coming to the age when everybody feels disturbed, particularly women from the West. Middle age is a troublesome and anguish-creating state.\nA few things for you to contemplate...\nFirst, one has to recognize that one is getting into middle age.\nMiddle age is when you still believe you will feel better in the morning.\nMiddle age is when you want to see how long your car will last instead of how fast it will go.\nMiddle age is when you are home on Saturday night, the telephone rings and you hope it is not for you.\nMiddle age is when you change from stud to dud.\nMiddle age is when you stop criticizing the older generation and start criticizing the younger one.\nThese are just symptoms I am telling you, so..!\nShunyo, people who have been here with me for almost ten or twelve years cannot be sexually repressed. That is my whole condemnation all over the world; you can call it my reputation. And asking me a question about sexual repression is just destroying my reputation!\nTwo men sitting in a bar were commiserating about married life. \"I know a man,\" says one, \"who has been married for thirty years and he spends every evening at home.\"\n\"That's what I call love,\" says the other.\n\"Oh, really?\" replied the first, \"the doctor called it paralysis.\" It all depends how you take it.\nYou are not sexually repressed. You suddenly remembered that you are an English lady...\nwhere are you?... what are you doing here?\nA commissar was visiting a collective farm to check on the season's crops. \"How are the potatoes?\" he inquired.\n\"The potatoes are so plentiful,\" a farmer replied, \"that if we put them end to end they will touch the feet of God.\"\n\"How can that be?\" blurted the commissar, \"there is no God.\" \"Well,\" the farmer answered, \"there are no potatoes either.\"\nShunyo, all that has happened is that that crazy Milarepa has escaped from you. But don't be worried; he is crazy enough, he will come back.\nYou can rely on me, I will see to it that the poor fellow comes back. He will roam about in the ashram a few days. You enjoy the freedom, and don't be worried; he cannot get lost. Finally he is going to come to you.\nThis has been going on for years. I have been watching it, I have never said anything to you. It is not something new. Hundreds of times he must have left you and he has come back. He is a very tame fellow. You have just to give him enough rope, so that he can enjoy the idea that he is free.\nThere is nothing to worry about. You simply enjoy a few days of peace and silence, and paralysis.\nIt is very rare to find time to be alone, to be oneself. It is fortunate to find some people who once in a while escape, before they get caught somewhere else. And he has proved so reliable that many times I was thinking, now he is lost -- and I see him back again.\nYou just have to learn patience. And by the way, it is a good excuse to learn patience, waiting and trusting that he will come. Suddenly, one night he will start knocking on your door.\nI don't think that there is any other woman who can tolerate him long enough except Prem Shunyo -- she is almost immune to Milarepa.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nFOR TEN YEARS I HAVE THOUGHT THAT WHEN YOU SAID THERE IS NO\nTIME-SPACE SEPARATION BETWEEN THE MASTER AND THE DISCIPLE, AND\nWHEN YOU SAID THE DISCIPLE HAS TO MELT INTO THE MASTER SO THAT\nTHEIR HEARTS BEAT TOGETHER, I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE SIMPLY\nBEING POETIC. THE OTHER EVENING WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT\nTHIS RELATIONSHIP, I SUDDENLY GOT THAT YOU MEAN WHAT YOU SAY\nSO POETICALLY.\nI WOULD LIKE TO TAKE YOU HOME WITH ME IN MY HEART, MY BELOVED\nMASTER, AND I AM A SLOW LEARNER WITH A FRIGHTENED HEART AND\nONLY SIX WEEKS.\nWILL YOU COME WITH ME THIS TIME?\nPrem Dheera, the first time you were right, when you thought I was simply being poetic.\nThe second time you were wrong, when you started thinking that I mean what I say so poetically -- I don't mean. If I start going into everybody's hearts it will be impossible to put me together again!\nYou can love me wherever you are. You can feel me wherever you are.\nBut poetry is poetry; don't make it something pragmatic and practical. When I talk about melting and about merging and about having a heart-to-heart communion, don't take it that that's actually what I mean. Those are only indications towards a very subtle phenomenon in which I remain I, you remain you. In fact, you become more yourself than you have ever been before.\nIf love cannot give you individuality, uniqueness, that love is impotent. The power of love consists of giving you freedom and authentic individuality and being. That's the way to take me with you.\nWhen you become an individual, peaceful, silent, utterly free from all kinds of bondage, then your freedom, your uniqueness, your love all indicate that you are taking me home.\nYou should not take me as a person.\nYou should take me as the values which I am teaching to you. If you take those values with your heart, you are taking me; hence I say again, the first time you were right when you thought I was being poetic. Poetry should never be understood literally; it is symbolic, but it is significant. Just because it is only symbolic does not mean it is insignificant. Its significance certainly does not consist in being factual. It is something much more than fact, it is truth itself.\nOrdinarily we don't make any distinction between fact and truth. Factually you cannot take me in your heart -- that is an impossibility. But truthfully, you can take me in your heart. That will mean my fragrance, my joy, my meditativeness, my ecstasy, my presence but not my person.\nIf you can understand this there is no problem -- I can come with you.\nJust one thing to be remembered: what kind of vehicle are you using?\nA Frenchman, a German and a Russian were boasting about the modes of transportation at their disposal.\n\"I drive a Renault to work,\" said the Frenchman. \"On Sundays I drive my Peugeot. And when I go abroad, I drive a Citroen.\"\n\"I drive a Volkswagen to work,\" said the German. \"On Sundays I drive my BMW, and when I go abroad I drive a Mercedes.\"\n\"As for me,\" said the Russian, \"I take the bus to work. On Sundays I drive around in my little Moskvitch. And when I go abroad, I drive a tank.\"\nSo just be careful if you are taking me in you heart, that you don't drive a tank -- I am a peaceful person and I don't want to go to war! But as far as my presence is concerned you are absolutely allowed to take me with you.\nMy whole effort here is not to create an illusion in you, but on the contrary to destroy all possibilities of illusion. Man has lived under all kinds of illusions; he is surrounded by hallucinations. When you fall in love with someone it is very rarely a true experience.\nMore often it is only an illusion, an idea, a projection. When you see someone as beautiful it is more your biology that is creating the illusion of beauty. Once your biological infatuation is finished the beauty will disappear; the same woman will not look beautiful at all.\nFrom the very beginning the woman has known the psychology of man better than man understands woman's psychology. In fact, man has been continuously saying that woman is a mystery. I don't see any mystery anywhere. I have known more women than perhaps anybody else in the world, and I have known men also. None of them is a mystery.\nEverything is absolutely clear, but you don't want to see it clearly -- you want to go on having illusions. Illusions are sweet, nice, beautiful. The truth, the bare, naked truth is not so sweet.\nGautam Buddha continuously says that when you see a beautiful woman, don't forget that she is just a skeleton, just as you are a skeleton, covered with a bag of\nskin. Maybe someone has a little longer nose and somebody has a little smaller nose, and somebody has round eyes and somebody has a different shape, but inside it is the same blood, bones, flesh. Beauty seems to be only skin-deep.\nIf you have X-ray eyes you will be surrounded with skeletons all around.\nJust recently it happened in Europe that one woman was driving a crane and she struck an electric pole. The shock was so tremendous, she fell down in a coma. She did not die, but after a few hours she came back to consciousness with a strange phenomenon: her eyes had become X-ray eyes. Now she is suffering from a tremendous migraine... but doctors are using her in the hospital as an X- ray machine. She has opened a new dimension.\nBecause of too much electricity the eyes have changed. Now they can see deep down inside you, and she is completely horrified. She cannot open her eyes because she cannot see your face; she can see only your skeleton. She cannot see your skin and your beautiful nose. She is the first woman who sees people as they actually are, without any illusions.\nAsked, \"Do you feel some difference between beautiful people and ugly?\" -- she laughed.\nShe said, \"There is no one who is beautiful and no one who is ugly. All are skeletons and horrible.\"\nA man was admitted to a psychiatric hospital because he thought he was Ronald Reagan.\nBut this caused a problem for the staff because they already had a Ronald Reagan on the books and the director thought it might cause trouble. But then he hit upon a brilliant idea. On his first night at the hospital, one of the staff put him in the same cell as the other Ronald Reagan in the hope that this confrontation would bring one or both to their senses.\nThe next morning he called the new man to his office and asked how his first night had been.\n\"Oh, doctor,\" replied the man, \"I have been living under a delusion for many years.\"\n\"That's an amazing insight,\" said the doctor excitedly. \"Please go on.\"\n\"Well,\" continued the man, \"for as long as I can remember, I thought I was Ronald Reagan, but I'm not.\"\n\"That's very good,\" said the doctor. \"So who are you?\"\nThe man looked at the doctor, smiled sweetly and said, \"I'm Nancy.\" People go on changing their illusions.\nI want you to come out of all the illusions and just see reality as it is. It is simple and it is beautiful. In the beginning you may be shocked because your delusions are destroyed.\nBut as you will become more and more accustomed and in accord with existence and reality, you will feel a tremendous freedom and a great sense of authenticity.\nGautam Buddha's statement is on record that to experience truth in the beginning is bitter, in the end it is very sweet. But illusions are totally different, just the contrary: in the beginning they are very sweet; in the end they turn out very bitter. In fact, this should be the criterion: something that is sweet in the beginning, be aware of it; it is illusion. Soon you will be awakened out of it and it will hurt and it will feel very bitter. It is better to experience truth, which is bitter in the beginning but in the end proves to be the sweetest experience possible.\nSo when I am talking to you, I have to be poetic for the simple reason that there are things which cannot be said in prose. There are things which can only be hinted at in a poetic way. But poetry can always be misunderstood because poetry is symbolic and you cannot take it as actual. The moment you take poetry as literal and factual, you are creating an illusion which will sooner or later be destroyed by the reality.\nNo illusion can live for long.\nEvery illusion has a very small lifespan.\nI don't want you to get into any kind of illusory relationship with me. I have been talking about the master and the disciple relationship from different angles,\nemphasizing many things; this also should be remembered, that all that has been said to you about it is poetic and symbolic.\nYou cannot merge or melt actually, but you can merge and melt by dropping your ego.\nThat's exactly the intention, that you drop the ego; that between the master and the disciple there will be only two persons -- the master and the disciple -- not four persons, the ego of the master and the ego of the disciple and then the master and the disciple behind their egos.\nThat is happening in almost all your relationships. On every bed where you find a couple, just look closely, you will find four persons: two real persons and two unreal persons.\nThose two unreal persons are created by both projecting something onto the other.\nNaturally there is going to be disillusionment. Every relationship comes into a state of disillusionment; then it really hurts. Never create any relationship with projection.\nAvoid your ego, avoid your mind.\nJust see clearly without any thoughts disturbing your vision and you will never create a relationship. You will have relatedness, you will have deep intimacy but there will be no relationship, no binding; otherwise every relationship becomes a kind of marriage. And the moment something becomes a marriage it has turned into an imprisonment. Certainly, the master disciple relationship cannot be allowed to turn into a marriage; that will destroy its whole purpose.\nThe whole purpose is to give you freedom, to help you to be free from all kinds of chains which you have mistaken for ornaments; to take you out of your imprisonment which you have taken as your home; to make you aware that your religion, your nation, your race, your caste, your ideology, all are different kinds of imprisonments, and they all turn you into prisoners.\nThey decorate their chains with flowers, they make their chains with gold, but it does not matter whether the chains are made of gold or of steel -- chains are chains, and they destroy your dignity. They destroy your humanity, they reduce\nyou into a slave. The whole of humanity is living in many kinds of slaveries.\nThe slavery has become multidimensional: you belong to a race, you belong to a nation, you belong to a religion, you belong to a political party... And all these are causes of your slavery; all these are destructive to your spirituality.\nAn authentic human being does not belong to any religion, does not belong to any nation, does not belong to any race. He is simply part of existence. Why belong to small trivial crowds when you can belong to the whole universe? And with belonging to the whole universe there is an immense difference.\nWhen you belong to the whole, it gives you freedom because the whole is unlimited and there are no limitations, no boundaries.\nThe whole can never become a prison to you.\nThe awakened man lives in the whole, belongs to the whole universe. He does not belong to small cages howsoever beautiful they may be.\nI want my people to belong to the whole. That's the only way I can help you, and I can show my love to you and my respect to you. It has not been the case in the past: no master has been respectful towards his disciples. He has asked that the disciples should be respectful towards him; that they should be grateful towards him; that they should be surrendered to him. These are very subtle games of the ego.\nIf you love, if your love is real, you will not ask for surrender. If your love is real you will have tremendous respect, it does not matter whether you are master or disciple.\nRespect, reverence for life, does not need any special qualification. You will be respectful to the trees and to the birds and to the stars too.\nA master who is not respectful to his disciples has no right to have any respect from the disciples either; it is a mutual understanding and awareness. The master is not in any way holier-than-thou or higher-than-thou. He may be more experienced in certain ways, he may be richer in his inner world, but that does not create any hierarchy. All hierarchies are created by the ego, and to be a master, to be an awakened person, the first thing is to drop the ego then you cannot create any hierarchy.\nThere is a beautiful story about Gautam Buddha's past life...\nHe loved to relate about his many past lives. At least twenty-four past lives he has related in his discourses to his disciples -- beautiful stories. It does not matter whether they are historically true or not. There is no way to find it out, and there is no reason to be worried about whether they are historical or not -- they are significant.\nHe says, \"In one of my past lives, when I was as unconscious as you are, when I was as miserable as you are, when I was searching for a master as you have come to me searching for a master, I heard about a man who had become enlightened. Immediately I rushed and when I reached a great crowd had already arrived.\n\"I touched the feet of the man who had become enlightened and the most surprising thing was that I had no thought of touching the feet -- it simply happened. Just the presence of the man was so immense, I found myself touching his feet without my will, without my thought, without my preparation, without even my readiness. I had just come to see out of curiosity whether he was really realized or not, and what had happened.\n\"As I came close to him something transpired and I touched his feet. I stood back and even a greater miracle happened: that man touched my feet.\n\"I said to him, `What are you doing? You are awakened, enlightened; I am an ignorant man in search of a master, and masters don't touch the feet of the disciples.'\n\"And the awakened man said, Ì don't belong to that category of masters. I am ready to touch everybody's feet because I know they are all going to become enlightened one day or other. And there are only seven days in a week! Somebody becomes enlightened on Monday and somebody becomes enlightened on Sunday -- it does not matter. One thing is certain, that everybody carries inside him a buddha. And I can see in you that it is not going to be long before you will be enlightened. I can see the seed has already died and that new sprouts have started growing within you. Seeing your great future, I touched your feet, and also to remind you that when you become an enlightened man, remember that one enlightened man has touched your feet when you were just a disciple.'\"\nGautam Buddha used to relate this story again and again to his disciples saying,\n\"I have as much respect towards you as you have. I have found the truth; you are searching for it.\nIt is not much of a difference. I have arrived; you are arriving.\"\nI don't want to create any kind of illusory relationship between me and you. I want to stand alone and I want you also to stand alone, and in our aloneness we shall meet.\nIn our aloneness, in our freedom we shall have reverence and we shall have love, but our love will not be a bondage, and our respect will not create a hierarchy.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED MASTER,\nPLEASE SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE DISCIPLE'S ALONENESS AND COURAGE.\nAnand Taral, the first thing to realize is that whether you want or not, you are alone.\nAloneness is your very nature.\nYou can try to forget it, you can try not to be alone by making friends, having lovers, mixing in the crowd... But whatever you do remains just on the surface. Deep inside, your aloneness is unreachable, untouchable.\nA strange accident happens to every human being: as he is born the very situation of his birth begins in a family. And there is no other way, because the human child is the weakest child in the whole of existence.\nOther animals are born complete. A dog is going to remain a dog his whole life, he is not going to evolve, grow. Yes, he will become aged, old, but he will not become more intelligent, he will not become more aware, he will not become enlightened. In that sense all the animals remain exactly at the point of their birth; nothing essential changes in them. Their death and their birth are horizontal -- in one line.\nOnly man has the possibility of going vertical, upwards, not just horizontal. Most of humanity behaves like other animals: life is just growing old -- not growing up. Growing up and growing old are totally different experiences.\nMan is born in a family amongst human beings. From the very first moment he is not alone; hence, he gets a certain psychology of always remaining with people. In aloneness he starts feeling scared... unknown fears. He is not exactly aware of what he is afraid of, but as he moves out of the crowd something inside him becomes uneasy. To be with others he feels cozy, at ease, comfortable.\nIt is because of this reason he never comes to know the beauty of aloneness; the fear prevents him. Because he was born in a group he remains part of a group, and as he grows in age he starts making new groups, new associations, new friends. Already, existing collectivities don't satisfy him: the nation, the religion, the political party... He creates his own new associations: Rotary Club, Lions Club. But all these strategies are just to avoid one thing: never to be alone.\nThe whole life experience is of being together with people. Aloneness seems almost like a death. In a way it is a death; it is the death of the personality that you have created in the crowd. That is a gift of others to you. The moment you move out of the crowd you also move out of your personality.\nIn the crowd you know exactly who you are: you know your name, you know your degrees, you know your profession; you know everything that is needed for your passport, your identity card. But the moment you move out of the crowd, what is your identity, who are you? Suddenly you become aware that you are not your name -- your name was given to you. You are not your race -- what relationship has race with your consciousness? Your heart is not Hindu or Mohammedan; your being is not confined to any political boundaries of a nation; your consciousness is not part of any organization or church. Who are you?\nSuddenly your personality starts dispersing. This is the fear: the death of the personality.\nNow you will have to discover freshly, you will have to ask for the first time who you are. You will have to start meditating on the fact: Who am I? -- and there is a fear that you may not be at all. Perhaps you were nothing but a combination of all the opinions of the crowd, that you were nothing but your personality.\nNobody wants to be nothing. Nobody wants to be nobody.\nAnd in fact everybody is a nobody. There is a very beautiful story...\nAlice has reached Wonderland. She came to meet the king and the king asked, \"Alice, did you meet a messenger coming towards me?\"\nShe said, \"I met nobody.\"\nThe king said, \"If you met nobody, why has he not arrived yet?\"\nAlice was very much puzzled. She said, \"You are not understanding me rightly. Nobody is nobody.\"\nThe king said, \"That is obvious that nobody is nobody, but where is he? He should have reached here by this time. It simply means nobody walks slower than you.\"\nAnd naturally Alice was very much annoyed and forgot that she is talking to the king.\nShe said, \"Nobody walks faster than me.\"\nNow the whole conversation goes on with that \"nobody.\" She understands that he is saying, \"Nobody walks slower than you.\"\n\"... and I am a fast walker. I have come from the other world to Wonderland, a small world -- and he is insulting me.\" Naturally she retorts, \"Nobody walks faster than me!\"\nThe king said, \"If that is right then why has he not arrived?\" And this way the discussion continues.\nEverybody is a nobody.\nSo the first problem for a disciple is to understand exactly the nature of\naloneness. It means nobodiness; it means dropping your personality which is a gift to you by the crowd.\nAs you move off out of the crowd you cannot take that gift with you in your aloneness. In your aloneness you will have to discover again afresh, and nobody can give you the guarantee whether you will find anybody inside or not.\nThose who have reached to aloneness have found nobody there. I really mean no body.\nNo name, no form, but a pure presence, a pure life, nameless, formless. This is exactly the true resurrection, and it certainly needs courage. Only very courageous people have been able to accept with joy their nobodiness, their nothingness. Their nothingness is their pure being; it is a death and a resurrection both.\nJust today Hasya was showing me a small, beautiful cartoon: Jesus hanging on the cross, looking at the sky, is saying, \"It would have been better if alongside God the father I had Allah the uncle. It would have been better; at least if God was not listening, Allah might have helped.\"\nHaving just God for his whole life he was very happy proclaiming, \"I am the only begotten son of God.\" And he never talked about God's family, his brother, his wife, his other sons and daughters. In the whole of eternity what has he been doing? He does not have a TV to waste time, to pass time. He does not have any possibility of having a movie hall. What does this poor fellow go on doing?\nIt is a well-known fact that in poor countries the population goes on exploding for the simple reason that the poor man has no other free entertainment. The only free entertainment is to produce children. Although it is in the long run very costly, right now there is no ticket, no problem, no standing in the queue...\nWhat has God been doing for the whole eternity? He has created only one son. Now on the cross he remembers that it would have been better if God really had a few brothers, sisters, uncles. \"I could have asked help from somebody else if he is not listening to me.\"\nHe is praying and he is being angry saying, \"Why have you forgotten me? Have you given up on me?\" -- but there is no answer.\nHe is waiting for the miracle. The whole crowd that has gathered to see the miracle by and by started dispersing. It was too hot, unnecessarily. Nothing is going to happen; if something was going to happen it would have happened.\nAfter six hours there were only three ladies left who were still believing that a miracle may happen. One was Jesus' mother -- naturally, mothers go on believing that their child is a genius. Every mother, without exception, believes that she has given birth to a child which is a giant.\nAnother woman who loved Jesus was a prostitute, Mary Magdalene. That woman, although she was a prostitute, must have loved Jesus. Even the disciples, the so-called apostles, who became second to Jesus in importance in the history of Christianity, all twelve escaped just out of fear of being caught and of being recognized -- because they were always hanging around with Jesus, everywhere. You never can believe the crowd: if they were caught, they might have been crucified, if not crucified at least beaten, stoned to death. Only three women were left.\nThe third was another woman who loved Jesus. It was love that remained in the last moments in the form of these three women. All those disciples must have been with Jesus just in order to get into paradise. It is always good to have good contacts, and you can't find a better contact than the contact with the only begotten son of God. Just behind him they will also be able to enter through the gates of paradise. Their disciplehood was a kind of exploitation of Jesus; hence there was no courage. It was cunning and clever, but not courageous.\nOnly love can be courageous.\nYou are asking about aloneness and courage. Courage comes out of love... Do you love yourself? Do you love this existence? Do you love this beautiful life which is a gift? It has been given to you without your being even ready for it, without your deserving it, without your being worthy of it.\nIf you love this existence which has given life to you, which goes on providing every moment life and nourishment to you, you will find courage. And this courage will help you to stand alone like a cedar of Lebanon, high -- reaching to the stars but alone.\nIn aloneness you will disappear as an ego and personality and you will find yourself as life itself, deathless and eternal. Unless you are capable of being\nalone your search for truth will remain a failure. Your aloneness is your truth.\nYour aloneness is your divineness.\nThe function of the master is to help you to stand alone. Meditation is just a strategy to take away your personality, your thoughts, your mind, your identity with the body, and leave you absolutely alone inside, just a living fire. And once you have found your living fire, you will know all the joys and all the ecstasies that human consciousness is capable of.\nThe old woman watched her grandson eat his soup with the wrong spoon, grasp his knife by the wrong end, eat the main course with his hands, and pour tea into the saucer and blow on it.\n\"Has not watching your mother and father at the dinner table taught you anything?\" she asked.\n\"Yes,\" said the boy, chewing with his mouth open, \"never to get married.\" He has learned a great lesson: Remain alone.\nIt is really very difficult to be with others, but we are accustomed from our very birth to be with others. It may be miserable, it may be a suffering, it may be a torture but we are accustomed; at least it is well known.\nOne is afraid to step into the darkness beyond the territory, but unless you go beyond the territory of the collective mask, you cannot find yourself.\nGroucho Marx has made a beautiful statement for you to remember: \"I find television very educating. Every time somebody turns on the set I go into the other room and read a book.\"\nThe teacher of a class of ten-year-olds is too shy to conduct the sex-education class and so she asks her class to make this a homework project.\nLittle Hymie asks his father who mumbles something about a stork. His grandmother said he came from a cabbage patch and his great-grandmother blushes and whispers that children come from the great ocean of existence.\nThe next day, little Hymie is called by the teacher to report on his project. Little Hymie says to the teacher, \"I'm afraid there is something wrong in our family. Apparently nobody has made love for three generations!\"\nIn fact, very few people have loved at all; they have pretended, have been hypocrites deceiving not only others but have deceived themselves too.\nYou can love authentically only when you are.\nRight now you are only a part of a crowd, a cog in the wheel. How can you love?\n--\nbecause you are not. First be; first know yourself.\nIn your aloneness you will discover what it is to be. And out of that awareness of your being love flows, and much more.\nAloneness should be your only search.\nAnd it does not mean that you have to go to the mountains, you can be alone in the marketplace. It is simply a question of being aware, alert, watchful, remembering that you are only your watchfulness. Then you are alone wherever you are. You may be in the crowd, you may be in the mountains; it makes no difference, you are just the same watchfulness. In the crowd you watch the crowd; in the mountains you watch the mountains. With open eyes you watch existence; with closed eyes you watch yourself.\nYou are only one thing: the watcher.\nAnd this watcher is the greatest realization. This is your buddha nature; this is your nature of enlightenment, of your awakening. This should be your only discipline. Only this makes you a disciple: this discipline of knowing your aloneness. Otherwise, what makes you a disciple? You have been deceived on every point in life. You have been told that to believe in a master makes you a disciple. That is absolutely wrong; otherwise, everybody in the world is a disciple.\nSomebody believes in Jesus, somebody believes in Buddha, somebody believes in Krishna, somebody believes in Mahavira; everybody believes in somebody but nobody is a disciple, because to be a disciple does not mean to believe in a\nmaster. To be a disciple means to learn the discipline of being your self, of being your true self.\nIn that experience is hidden the very treasure of life. In that experience you become for the first time an emperor; otherwise you will remain a beggar in the crowd. There are two kinds of beggars: poor beggars and rich beggars, but they are all beggars. Even your kings and your queens are beggars.\nOnly those people, very few people who have stood alone in their being, in their clarity, in their light, who have found their own light, who have found their own flowering, who have found their own space they can call their home, their eternal home -- those few people are the emperors. This whole universe is their empire. They don't need to conquer it; it is already conquered.\nBy knowing oneself you have conquered it. Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho. The Invitation Chapter #24\nChapter title: Virtue is the currency of heaven\n2 September 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium Archive\ncode: 8709020\nShortTitle: INVITA24\nAudio: Yes\nVideo:\nYes Length:\n116\nmins Question 1\nBELOVED OSHO,\nHOW IS IT THAT GOING INTO SOMETHING CONSCIOUSLY HAS SUCH A POWER TO REVEAL ALL THE THREADS WHICH MAKE UP THE TANGLE?\nDevageet, the reality is just the opposite. All our tangles in life are created by our unconsciousness, so the moment you become conscious those tangles disappear. It is not the power of consciousness that makes them disappear. It is the power of unconsciousness that creates them.\nAll the tangles of life, of love, of relationship are created by our unconsciousness. We don't know what we are doing, and by the time we become aware it is too late. What has been done cannot be undone. Our unconsciousness is very supportive to the ego -- they have a co-existence. Coming of consciousness will not only disperse all the tangles, it will also disperse you as an ego. It is a very complicated and complex phenomenon.\nIn your unconsciousness you do something. It is almost certain that once you have done something wrong that has created misery in you, around you, you will come to your senses. But you cannot undo it because the ego comes in between. You cannot even say,\n\"I am sorry.\" Just a simple apology may disperse the tangle but the ego won't allow even that. And you are almost a victim; you are not doing things. Your unconsciousness, your unawareness goes on forcing you to do things.\nJust last night I answered Prem Shunyo's question very lightly and very lovingly\nand very joyously. I joked about it, but she was pissed off -- I could see her face. Milarepa was angry.\nYou don't know what you are doing. What you are doing is almost beyond your hands; you are reacting. If Prem Shunyo had heard what I was saying... I was simply saying,\n\"Don't take it seriously.\" I was laughing about it, but she could not laugh. You all laughed because it was not your problem. The more you laughed the more you made her serious.\nIn each person's life the time of change comes. And one of the greatest things to remember is that when you change a certain pattern of life, you have to change naturally.\nIt is not in your hands. Biology makes you capable of sex at the age of thirteen or fourteen; it is not your doing.\nAt a certain age, as you are coming closer to forty or forty-two, the biology's purpose is finished. All those hormones that have been propelling you are disappearing. To accept this change is very difficult. You suddenly start thinking as if you are no longer beautiful, that you need a face-lift.\nI have heard about a woman who was saying to the plastic surgeon, \"I need a face-lift.\"\nThe surgeon looked at her and he said, \"There is nothing wrong; it is just age. Don't be worried about it. Why unnecessarily go to the trouble? But the woman was insistent, so the doctor said, \"Okay, but it will cost five thousand dollars.\"\nThe woman said, \"That much money I don't have. Can't you suggest something cheaper?\"\nThe doctor said, \"Yes. You can purchase a veil.\"\nIt is one of the Western problems. In the East no woman is worried. Things are accepted as they come. Acceptance has been the basic foundation of Eastern life. The West is continuously imposing on nature, demanding how things should be. Nobody wants to become old, so when the time of transition from one stage of life comes, a very strange phenomenon happens -- and that is what is happening\nto Shunyo. I did not say it because I did not want to hurt her.\nIt is going to happen whether I say anything about it or not, just as a candle comes to the very end, has only a few seconds more before it will be gone. At the last moment the candle suddenly becomes bigger with all its power.\nNobody wants to go.\nIt is a well-known fact to medical science that people at the time of death suddenly become completely healthy; all their diseases disappear. This is the last effort of their life\n-- to resist death. The people who are related to them feel very happy that suddenly all diseases have disappeared. The person has become calm and quiet, but they don't know that it signifies death. The diseases have disappeared because their function is fulfilled: they have killed the man. Now it is the last spurt of life.\nThe same happens with every biological change in life. When sex is becoming irrelevant, you start thinking of sex more than ever, and suddenly a great spurt... That is what is giving her the idea that it seems she is sexually repressed -- because so much sexuality is suddenly overwhelming the mind.\nThe mind can only understand logically, rationally one thing: from where is this sexuality coming? -- it must be coming from the repressed unconscious. That is what Sigmund Freud and their followers have been teaching to the whole world. They are right on many points; they are wrong on many points. Particularly about this point, the transition when you are no longer young and the hormones in you are going to disappear, and the interest in sex is going to die -- before dying it will explode with its full force.\nIf you go to a psychoanalyst, he will say that you are sexually repressed. I cannot say that, because I know that this sudden overwhelming sexuality will be gone by itself, you don't have to do anything. It is the signal that life is passing through a change. Now, life will be more calm and more quiet. You are really entering into a better state.\nSex is a little childish. As you become more and more mature, sex loses the grip over you\n-- and it is a good sign. It is something to be happy about; it is not a problem to be solved.\nIt is something to celebrate.\nIn the East no woman ever feels the trouble of the transition from youth to old age. In fact, she feels immensely happy that now that old demon is gone and life can be more peaceful. But the West has been living under many illusions. One is the illusion that there is only one life. That creates immense trouble. If there is only one life and sex is disappearing, so you are finished. Now, there is no more opportunity; there will not be any more excitement in life. Nobody is going to say, \"You are beautiful and I love you and I will love you forever.\"\nSo first, the illusion of one life creates a problem. Second, the psychoanalysts and other therapists have created another illusion that sex is almost synonymous to life. The more sexual you are, the more alive you are. So when sex starts disappearing one starts feeling like a used cartridge: now there is no point to live; life ends with sex ending. Then people try all kinds of bizarre things: face lift, plastic surgery, false breasts. It is stupid, simply stupid. People start trying wigs; they start trying dresses which are sex-provoking.\nAlmost all Western women are starving -- they call it dieting! The idea in the West is that a woman is beautiful if she is not fat. And nature has some other idea: the woman has to be a little fat because for nature the woman is a mother. A mother needs extra fat for the child, because when the child is in her womb he will need food. And when the child is in the womb, the mother starts feeling nausea; she cannot eat, she starts throwing up. She needs emergency fat in her body so she can feed the child because the child needs food; he is growing fast.\nScience says that in the nine months in the mother's womb, a child grows so fast that he will never grow so fast again in his seventy years. In nine months he passes through almost the whole evolution of man, from the fish... all the stages. His requirements have to be fulfilled by the mother -- And she cannot eat... you can imagine. It is troublesome to have a child in your belly. I don't think any man is ready to be pregnant: he will commit suicide; without any doubt he will jump from a fifty-storey building, \"I am finished...\npregnant...?\"\nJust think, the idea that you have a child in the belly, and you will go crazy. But how to get rid of it...\nThe mother goes through immense suffering, great sacrifice; hence, in the East we have not created the idea of a skinny woman. Of course, the skinny woman looks more sexually attractive, younger. The fat woman looks less sexually interesting, because she loses proportions. Her waist is no longer very small. Her body has gathered so much fat that nobody will feel attracted towards her. She does not have the necessary attraction for the human mind.\nThe East has accepted that a woman has to be a little more fat than a man, a little more rounded.\nJust the other day somebody brought me a book of pictures taken by one famous photographer and on the front page was Sophia Loren. In the East she cannot be conceived of as very beautiful: she must be dieting -- and dieting is nothing but the rich man's idea of starvation.\nThe poor people starve by themselves. The rich people starve in a costly way under professional guidance. The fear that you will not be attractive, that you will no longer be looked at by people... You will pass through the street and nobody will look at you; who is going...?\nIt is a great need of man, and particularly women, to have attention -- attention is nourishment. A woman suffers immensely when nobody pays attention to her. She has nothing else to attract people by; she has only her body. Man has not allowed her to have other dimensions where she can become a famous painter, a dancer or a singer, a learned professor. Man has cut all other dimensions from the woman's life where she can be attractive and people will pay respect even while she becomes old.\nI have to remind you of the meaning of `respect': it means looking back. When somebody passes by: re-spect. It has nothing to do with honor; it has something to do with your being suddenly aware that a beautiful thing has passed.\nWoman is left only the body by man, so she is so much concerned with the body that it creates clinging, possessiveness, fear that the person who loves her, if he leaves, perhaps will find another person. And without attention she starts feeling\nalmost dead: What is the use of life if nobody is paying attention to you? She does not have an intrinsic life of her own.\nMan has taught woman that her life depends on others' opinions about her. You can see all over the world that beauty competitions are arranged only for women, and the woman does not even revolt against these ideas. Why not for men? Just as you choose a Mrs. or Miss Universe, choose a Mr. Universe. No, nobody bothers about the man's body. He can grow fat; he can become a Winston Churchill. Still he attracts attention because he has power.\nIn the same book just beside Sophia Loren is Winston Churchill -- ugly, as fat as you can conceive, the whole face sagging. He needs a face-lift -- not Sophia Loren -- but he will not bother; there is no need. He can have power, he can be the prime minister. He can be this and he can be that...\nMan has managed over the centuries to have all the other dimensions of attracting people, and he has left to woman only one dimension: her body. He has made woman just a vegetable. And naturally, the vegetable starts being worried if there are no customers.\nIt is not a coincidence that in the most sexually perverted country, France, while being in love with a woman, you say, \"I want to eat you.\" Are these people cannibals? Is the woman a vegetable or what? \"I want to eat you\" shows a great respect for the woman!\nWhen nobody says to her, \"I want to eat you,\" she thinks, \"I am now finished. Life has come to an end!\"\nBut here with me you have to learn something. The first thing is a deep acceptability of all the changes that nature brings to you. Youth has its own beauty; old age has its own beauty too. It may not be sexual, but if a man has lived silently, peacefully, meditatively, then old age will have a grandeur of its own.\nJust as the snow-covered peaks look beautiful, the white hairs of old age also have their own beauty -- and not only beauty, but wisdom too, which no young man can claim, because all his behavior is stupid. He is running behind this woman, running behind that woman.\nThe old man has stopped all this running business. He has settled in himself. He\nis no longer dependent on anybody else. The old woman should follow the same way. There should be no difference between men and women.\nThat is why I was simply laughing and joking about Prem Shunyo's question because I did not want her to become serious about something which is natural. And if Milarepa feels angry, he simply proves what I have been saying, that he is crazy.\nNow he is running after younger women. This shows that you are not maturing, not learning that what you call love is not love, but biological slavery. Love happens only when you are beyond biological slavery; then love has a beauty. Biological slavery and the biological relationship are so ugly that for centuries people have decided to make love in darkness without light, so they don't see what they are doing.\nParticularly the woman is very sensitive when you make love to her; she immediately closes her eyes. Just to see this nasty thing that is happening...\nI have heard that when Henry Ford died he was received with a great welcome in heaven and even God thanked him: \"You have done great service to humanity by creating so many cars -- you are a great creator.\"\nHenry Ford said, \"That's okay, but you are not that great a creator. You have put man's body in such a stupid way that the loveliest part people think about, dream about is so close to the dirtiest part. Could you not find somewhere else in the whole body?\nWhy has love to be sandwiched between the ugliest parts? You don't have any sense, no aesthetics. The exhaust pipe is so close to the most lovely part that I cannot believe that you are a great creator\" -- and he was right.\nGod has committed many mistakes. This is one of the major mistakes. The loving part could have been anywhere else: you have a six-foot-long-body, so much territory! And what kind of a stupid god... where he puts the loving parts?\nNot only is it to be accepted when life is going through a biological change, but it has to be rejoiced that you have passed over all that stupidity, that now you are free from biological bondage; it is only a question of conditioning.\nWhen you ask me questions you should remember that I never in any way want\nto hurt you. Even sometimes if I have to avoid the truth, I avoid it but don't hurt you. If you get hurt about something that must be your own mind. But perhaps you are just a victim in that too -- it is unconscious.\nDevageet, you are asking, \"How is it that going into something consciously has such a power to reveal all the threads which make up the tangle?\"\nThey have been made in your unconsciousness. They have been made in the darkness of your being. And when you bring light, naturally you see all the tangle: how you have created your misery, your suffering, your anguish, yourself. Seeing it is enough -- all those tangles disappear.\nA conscious man never creates any tangle; he lives more intensely than anybody else. But his life is without any tangles for the simple reason that in consciousness you cannot create tangles.\nAbbie's wife had just died and he was standing over the grave and sobbing uncontrollably. His best friend put his arm around him and said, \"Abbie, time is a wonderful thing. Believe it or not some day you will want to start a new life again and be with people, maybe even get married again. Listen to me: Time heals wounds.\"\nAbbie looked at him and replied, \"I know, I know... but what am I going to do tonight?\"\nSuch is the unconsciousness of man. The wife died in the morning and he is worried about what he is going to do in the night -- tonight! And you are talking about time: that some day wounds will be healed. What about tonight?\nI have heard an ancient story, Arabic, that a man's father died and all the old people of the neighborhood came and said, \"Don't be worried, son. If you have lost your father, we are here. Don't think for a single moment that you are fatherless. We are all your fathers. You can come always to us in any difficulty, any problem.\"\nHe was very much consoled, seeing the concern of his neighborhood people. He had never thought that they would be so considerate.\nAnd then his mother died and all the old women came and said, \"Don't be worried. We are still alive. You can look at us as your mother and whatever your\nmother was doing for you, we can do. There is no problem about it.\"\nHe was very much consoled. And then his wife died, and not a single wife from the neighborhood came to say don't be worried we are here. Whatever your wife was doing, we will do...!\nThe man was very angry. He stood in front of his house, watching if anybody would come or not -- and nobody came. Finally, he started shouting, \"You nasty people. When my father died all the old people came. When my mother died all the old women came.\nAnd now my wife has died and no young woman is coming -- what kind of neighborhood is this?\n\"... absurd, illogical! I am waiting from the morning for somebody to turn up, but nobody has come.\"\nOne has to accept life. But your unconsciousness does not allow you to accept life as it is.\nYou wanted something else.\nIt is perfectly good when sex disappears. You will be more capable of meditating. You will be more capable of being alone. You will be more capable of being blissful, without any misery because the whole game of sex is nothing but a long misery -- fighting, hate, jealousy, envy. It is not a peaceful life.\nIt is peace, silence, blissfulness, aloneness, freedom which give you the real taste of what life is.\nTwo women are talking in a tearoom at four o'clock over two large, gooey ice cream sundaes and little sugary cakes. They have not seen each other since high school days and one is bragging about her very advantageous marriage.\n\"My husband buys me whole new sets of diamonds when the ones I have get dirty,\" she says, \"and I have never even bothered to clean them.\"\n\"Fantastic,\" said the other woman.\n\"Yes,\" says the first, \"we get a new car every two months.\"\n\"Fantastic,\" says the other.\n\"And our house...\" pursues the first woman, \"Well, what is the use of talking about it, it is just...\"\n\"Fantastic,\" finishes the other.\n\"Yes, and tell me, what are you doing nowadays?\" asked the first woman. \"I go to the charm school,\" says the other.\n\"Charm school! Why, how quaint. What do you learn there?\" \"Well, we learn to say, fantastic, instead of bullshit.\"\nIn your unconsciousness everything is bullshit. And when you become conscious, it is really fantastic: all tangles disappear, all problems disappear. But you need not go to a charm school to learn it, because in a charm school deep down the woman is saying,\n\"Bullshit.\"\nAnd she is just repeating like a parrot, \"Fantastic,\" but she means bullshit. Not in a charm school, but in a school where your unconsciousness slowly, slowly disappears leaving a luminous being within you -- then there is no tangle in life.\nI have lived a very strange life. Anybody else would have found so many tangles in it, so many troubles. I have also passed through all kinds of tangles, troubles, problems, but I have remained unscratched; I have enjoyed the journey. Whatever life brought to me, I have enjoyed it. I have tried to make the best out of it, whatever it is.\nThere is no point in crying and weeping over spilled milk. Any situation can be made a learning, a step towards maturity, can be turned into a beneficial opportunity. That is what I call intelligence; otherwise, what is the difference between intelligent people and unintelligent people.\nDevageet, it is true consciousness has tremendous power, but it is not used in revealing and dispersing the tangles of your life; they simply disappear as you become conscious.\nGautam Buddha used to say that when the lights are on and from the windows people can see that the master is awake, thieves don't come close. When the lights are put off, only then do thieves come close to the house to see whether the master has gone to sleep and it is the right time to enter. He was saying this about consciousness. He used to call sex, greed, lust for power, position, respectability all thieves. They come to you only when they see that there is no light in the man; inside it is all dark.\nOnce you are radiating consciousness and light, those thieves don't come close to you.\nBut consciousness has its own power. It is simply in the presence of consciousness that tangles disappear. The power is not used for dispersing the tangles and problems; the power is to bring blissfulness. The power is to bring peace, silence, at homeness, at easeness and a tremendous ecstasy, a divine drunkenness.\nLife becomes for the first time self-oriented; you don't have to beg from others for anything. Nobody can give you blissfulness; nobody can give you ecstasy. Nobody can give you the sense of immortality and the dance that comes with it. Nobody can give you the silence, which becomes a song in your heart.\nWhat can people give to you? In fact, the power of consciousness gives you so much that you become capable of sharing with people. For the first time, you can give to people.\nThey are living in darkness; they haven't seen any light. They don't have any idea what a conscious being is. They don't have any conception, comprehension of the power of consciousness, how many flowers shower, how much fragrance becomes natural to you.\nYou can give, and you can give them a taste and you can give them a direction, so they can also find the same power which is dormant in them.\nA conscious man awakened can help millions of people to move towards the source of joy, real and authentic life, to pure love which knows nothing of hate, which knows nothing of jealousy, which has nothing to do with body and biology -- which is just a spiritual communion, a feeling of deep compassion for your innermost being.\nYes, the power of consciousness gives you many things. The treasure is inexhaustible, but your problems and tangles that have been created by unconsciousness -- for them no power is needed, just the presence of consciousness is enough.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nCAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT VIRTUE?\nFantastic! Here, we are not concerned about virtue at all. Virtue is for people who are unconscious; it is a training for them to say, \"Don't say bullshit, say fantastic!\"\nVirtue is a training a discipline imposed on unconscious people. All the religions talk about virtue as being against sin. They have made fixed categories. Some things are condemned as sin and some things are praised as virtues. The virtuous man will have immense reward after death, and the sinner will be condemned to hellfire for eternity.\nThis is the strategy of fear and greed, because man can be easily manipulated by these two things -- fear and greed. Heaven is nothing but greed exaggerated; so hell is fear exaggerated, and human beings are afraid of eternal hellfire. Out of fear they somehow try to avoid whatever is sin. And the trouble is anything that gives you joy, anything that gives you pleasure is sin.\nOut of fear they lose all contact with life, they become dry and dead before their death.\nThere is only one consolation: that they are declared saints, they are worshipped. Just their ego is satisfied greatly; otherwise they are suffering deep down immensely.\nThat is why your saints cannot laugh: laughter needs a little juice. There is no juice in them; everything is dry. They are deserts where nothing grows green. So on the one hand the pressure of fear...\nI have seen pictures of the Middle Ages: there were Christian preachers who made so much fuss about hell and its tortures that just to be in the church\nlistening to their sermons many ladies used to faint. Just the idea that they were going into such detail...\nwhat would be done to you? The people thought the preachers were great according to how much they could infect people's psychologies. The greatest preacher was one in whose congregation almost everybody fainted.\nA deep fear psychology, a deep guilt psychology on the one hand, and on the other hand greed to be fulfilled as a reward. You will be getting everything in paradise: all those things which are sins here on the earth, they will also be available to you.\nMohammedans are against alcohol, but in their paradise there are rivers of alcohol. You don't have to go to a small pub, you can drink, you can drown, you can swim. All the rivers, they don't consist of water -- pure wine. Here it is condemned: you should not fall in the trap of love. A woman is condemned and in the heaven -- in every religion's idea of heaven -- women are freely supplied. Of course, according to your virtue you will get. If your virtue is great perhaps, Sophia Loren -- it all depends on your virtue.\nA strange game has been played with the human mind. Thousands of girls... I say girls, because they don't grow in age. They don't have to feel like Prem Shunyo; they are fixed for eternity at the age sixteen. In fact, they are prostitutes, eternal prostitutes, but they are thought to be rewards for saints. How many other saints have used those rewards, because since the beginning the same staff has been working, not even a shift change. I have never come across anything about a shift change or any staff change in the holy scriptures -- the same young women.\nThey remain always young. They don't perspire; they do not need deodorants. They must be certainly made of plastic, because only plastic does not perspire. A real skin is bound to perspire if it is alive, because through every pore of the skin you are breathing in. And perspiration is a natural way of keeping you at the same body temperature.\nIf it is too cold you start shivering. You may not be aware why you are shivering. You think it is because of the cold; it is to keep your body temperature continuously the same.\nShivering gives you inner heat. In the hot season you perspire. You perspire so that your water, perspiration is taken away by the heat; it evaporates so the heat\ndoes not affect your temperature. It simply evaporates your perspiration. It leaves you without increasing your temperature; otherwise, if there was no perspiration, your life span would not be very big.\nThe life span can be measured in many ways: in years, seventy years, but as body temperature from ninety-eight to one hundred and ten -- just twelve degrees is your span of life. If there was no perspiration, your temperature would be as high as the heat is around you. The moment you pass one hundred and five, you would start getting dizzy.\nThe moment you pass one hundred and seven, you would be falling into a coma. The moment you pass one hundred and ten, you would have passed away.\nIt is perspiration that saves you; it is your life savior. But those poor plastic girls... and eternal promise for all joys!\nThe Hindu heaven has certain trees, which they call kalpavriksha, wish- fulfillment trees.\nYou don't have to order a cup of tea or a woman or a car; you don't have to order anybody; you don't have to call any bearer or give a call to some agency. You just sit under the wish-fulfilling tree -- and they are all over heaven, everywhere\n-- you just sit underneath and you say whatever you want, and immediately, instantly, it will be provided.\nThere is a beautiful story of a man, who by some accident stumbled into heaven. He had no idea where he had reached. He was sitting under a kalpavriksha. He was feeling very hungry. He had been traveling a lot and that is how he had stumbled somehow by accident into heaven.\nHe said, \"I am feeling hungry but I don't see any hotel anywhere, any restaurant, nothing.\nI don't see even a single man. But I am feeling very hungry, if I could get some good food... Immediately beautiful women appeared from nowhere with all kinds of sweets and delicious foods. He was so hungry that he did not pay attention to where all these things were coming from.\nHe started eating, feeling perfectly well. He was tired. He went to sleep. Before going to sleep, he thought that sleeping on the ground, uneven with stones, if\nsomeone could arrange just a mattress, and suddenly -- he could not believe -- again beautiful women appeared with a beautiful bed and they put him on the bed. But he was so tired that he still did not think what was going on.\nWhen refreshed, he awoke. He thought, my God, there is nobody here who has brought the food, and I have not said to anybody; I just thought about it! And he looked at the beautiful bed, \"Who has brought this? I had simply thought about lying down on the ground. It seems there must be ghosts around.\" That was the natural conclusion, because he was not aware that he was in heaven, under a kalpavriksha.\n\"There must be ghosts all around, my God\" -- and immediately ghosts appeared, because whatever you would say... The moment he saw the skeletons of ghosts dancing all around, he said, \"My god, they are going to kill me\" -- and they killed him. The man never came back.\nReligions have used fear to prevent you from living, and greed to help you so that you can be patient and hope that great things are ahead. Just the small things you are leaving, and for eternity you will enjoy all the pleasures that you want -- and you don't have to pay for them.\nVirtue is the currency of heaven.\nThe more virtuous you are, the bigger a bank balance you have in heaven. I don't teach you virtue because your virtue is false, because deep down there is greed.\nI teach you only awareness.\nOut of awareness whatever you do is virtue according to me. And out of unawareness whatever you do is sin according to me. And according to me, your sins are not going to take you to hell. Your sins immediately give you hell -- here, just now. And your virtues are not going to give you an eternity of paradise. Your virtues give you joy, blissfulness, the moment you act with full awareness.\nThe punishment and the reward is immediate: the reward follows your action. But it depends where your action will lead you. It can be unconscious action, then hell herenow.\nIt has nothing to do with geography; it is something to do with your psychology.\nActing consciously, you are in paradise wherever you are. Once you have learned, you will not ask, \"What is virtue?\" You will ask, \"What is awareness? What is consciousness?\" You will ask, \"What is meditation?\" -- because that is going to make you conscious and make you alert.\nWhat brings misery is sin. Whatever brings joy is virtue.\nAlfred North Whitehead has made a beautiful statement: It requires a very unusual mind to make an analysis of the obvious.\nTo me, it is absolutely obvious that virtue or sin, heaven or hell are secondary. The primary is your alertness, your awareness, but people won't ask the obvious. These are by-products, and by getting entangled with by-products you will be in trouble.\nThere is a tale concerning Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson on board a train...\nThey passed a flock of sheep and Watson said, \"A sizable flock, Holmes.\"\n\"Ah, exactly seven hundred and eighty-four in number, my dear Watson,\" said Holmes sleepily.\n\"Good heavens, Holmes,\" said Watson. \"Surely you can't have counted them.\"\nThey are in a train; the train has passed the sheep. The flock is left far behind and it must have taken a single moment to pass.\n\"Not directly,\" said Holmes. \"I made use of a simple trick any school child knows. I merely counted the legs and divided by four.\"\nJust don't get into nonsense; otherwise, you will always feel what Leonardo da Vinci has confessed in his letters: I have offended God and mankind because my work did not reach the quality it should have. Now, Leonardo da Vinci is one of the greatest geniuses, and whatever he has done is incomparable. There is nobody else who even comes close to him. But even such a great man feels a little guilt, \"I have not reached the quality it should have.\"\nThis is the atmosphere that religions have created in the world. They don't allow anybody to be at ease, even the greatest genius. They go on telling you that you are still not doing right; you are still far away from the goal. You are still unworthy; you are always unworthy. They will not leave you at peace so that you can enjoy life and love life and be grateful to God, and be grateful to the universe -- which both mean the same to me.\nGod is not a person. It is this whole universe -- these trees, these clouds, the sun, the stars, you and everybody, whether asleep or awake, whether committing sins or virtues, you are part of one organic universe.\nIf you commit a sin... The word `sin' has been contaminated by the religions; otherwise it simply means in its roots, forgetfulness, unawareness. It means exactly what I am saying to you. Sin is your unawareness. Any action done in unconsciousness is sin. But religions have completely destroyed the original meaning of the word. Whatever you are doing consciously is virtue and there is no ready-made list of what are virtues, because in a different situation, the same thing may become sin. The thing that was virtue in one condition, in one context, may not be virtue in another context; it all depends. But how are you going to know whether in this context it is virtue or sin.\nThose dead categories that have been given to you like the ten commandments, fixed forever, they don't take account of the fact that life is continuously changing and you are moving every moment into a new situation -- and a new situation needs a new response.\nSo I don't give you, I can't give you any ready-made list to avoid these things, that these are sins and avoid them because they will lead you to hell. I cannot exploit you and your fears and I cannot say to you that these are the commandments, if you follow them yours is the kingdom of God, because in life things go on changing.\nIt happened...\nI had a friend; he was a professor in the university -- a very learned professor of Sanskrit.\nHe wanted to go to Tibet because many scriptures in Sanskrit on Buddhism had been burned by the Hindus in India. But their translations exist in Tibetan still, so he wanted to translate them back into Sanskrit.\nIt was a great idea and he was well versed in Sanskrit. He had been learning Tibetan for years and now he was ready. But he was a brahmin by caste, a very orthodox brahmin.\nIn India it is perfectly good to get up at five o'clock, early in the morning and have a good bath in the nearby lake or in the nearby river, and then do your prayer, meditate. Only after that can you enter into the mundane world of your profession, your life, your family.\nIn Tibet, the Tibetan holy book says that only one bath a year is allowed; Tibetan monks are the dirtiest people to find. I have been harassed by Tibetan monks.\nWhen the Dalai Lama came for the first time -- escaped from Tibet with thousands of Lamas -- I was taking a camp in Bodhgaya and all the Lamas first came to pay respect to the place where Gautam Buddha had become enlightened. I was taking a camp just there in the compound of the memorial temple for Buddha. I had never come across Tibetan Lamas. But such are habits, they die very hard. They use, I think three or four layers of clothes, one on top of another. Their clothes are greasy, dusty and they will not take any bath because their holy scripture says once in a year is compulsory.\nWhen my friend reached Tibet, he continued to follow his pattern of life in India. He could not manage to be there more than three days, because he had to take a bath early in the morning, five o'clock, according to the brahmin religion. Without taking a bath you cannot eat; that is a sin -- and in India it is certainly right. But in Tibet the whole context is different. To take a bath in ice-cold water, five o'clock in the early morning is to freeze yourself to death. Food is not a problem. You will not be able to eat food. In three days he got so tortured by this morning bath.\nOne day he tried; it was too much. The whole day he was feeling as if his blood was frozen. And for another two days he could not eat because he could not take the bath. So he had taken only one bath in Tibet and one day he had eaten and two days he remained without food. But he thought, How long will it be because I cannot survive without food, neither can I survive with the bath. It is better to go home, forget all about those scriptures; it is none of my business.\nHe came back. I was surprised when I saw him back \"... so quick you managed to translate.\"\nHe said, \"Forget all about translations. Congratulate me that I am alive.\" And when he told me I said that this is stupidity.\nIn Tibet you should look at the context, not at your Hindu idea of virtue and sin -\n- that is stupidity. Mohammedans have been allowed by their founder, Mohammed, four wives, and it is perfectly virtuous to have four wives.\nMohammed himself married nine wives. Obviously he was a prophet, no ordinary man, but, it was perfectly right in those times because the Arabs were continuously fighting and killing. But only men were killed; it was against their culture to kill any woman. The women were raped, but not killed.\nSo there was a strange situation; there were four times more women than men. If he had insisted that monogamy was virtue, as is being insisted all over the world\n-- polygamy or even bigamy is a crime, is a sin -- he would not have been right. Because if monogamy had been virtuous, what would have happened to the three women who are left without men? They would corrupt the whole of society. They will become prostitutes and the whole society would become an ugly scene. So Mohammed is perfectly right; I support him.\nBut not now in India, where women and men are equal as they are everywhere, nature keeps a balance, an exact balance. To keep the balance nature has to take care: it gives birth to one hundred and fifteen boys when it gives birth to one hundred girls, because fifteen boys will pop off before the time of marriage -- boys are weak and fragile.\nThe ordinary idea that women are weak and fragile is just male chauvinistic imposition.\nNature knows better: fifteen boys per hundred are going to die. Girls don't die; they have a greater resistance against diseases. They are not so often sick and they live longer than men, five years longer all over the world.\nSo by the time the marriageable age comes, there are a hundred boys and a hundred girls.\nMonogamy seems to be absolutely right in this context, but Mohammedans go on insisting that it is part of their religion... So even in India they are allowed to have four wives. It is such an ugly situation because it means three men will remain without wives.\nSo the Mohammedans abduct women from other religions.\nHindus particularly are very touchy people. If a woman has been forcibly taken by the Mohammedans to their homes, even if they have not touched her she will not be accepted back in the Hindu fold, she has to go to the Mohammedans. She has fallen below the dignity of a Hindu.\nSo Mohammedans have been continually stealing women from other societies. They have to, because what to do with the three men that are without women? Those three men will start relationships with others' wives and that will create a mess. And the Indian constitution, which, in the name of religion, doesn't want to interfere in any religion, cannot do anything to prevent Mohammedans from this polygamy. And those four women that they marry, they use as economic, financial help; they work and the husband rests. This is great!\nThe Mohammedan priests go on insisting on no interference, because a man with four women can create four children per year, very easily, but a woman with four men cannot create four children; she will create only one child. The population of Mohammedans goes on increasing as nobody else can increase the population the way they can. So you will not be surprised that India has been divided; Mohammedans have taken Pakistan and made it separate. The country has been cut into three parts: one side is Pakistan, given to Mohammedans; another side is Bangladesh, given to Mohammedans. And still, within forty years, in India Mohammedans are again number two to Hindus.\nAgain they can ask for another country. And you will also be surprised that India is a Hindu country but the number of Mohammedans in India is more than in any Mohammedan country in the world -- not even Arabia, or Egypt, or Iran, or Libya, or Palestine... No Mohammedan country has so many Mohammedans as India has.\nIndia is the greatest Mohammedan country in the world if you take the number of the Mohammedans. And the number goes on growing four times more. Hindus are simply puzzled what to do because soon they will be outnumbering Hindus. They have taken Pakistan, they have taken Bangladesh, and it is not far away when they will be the majority and Hindus will become the minority in their own country.\nSituations, contexts should be taken into account and that is possible only if you\nare living a very alert and conscious life; otherwise you will follow dead, ready- made things which may have been relevant at some time. Those times have changed and they have become irrelevant, but the list continues to be the same.\nSo I don't give you any list. I have been asked by priests, Hindus, Mohammedans, Christians, that I should make a clear-cut statement: what are sins, what are virtues and what are my fundamental principles of religion?\nI said, \"My first fundamental and the last fundamental is that religion cannot be a fixed thing. It has to be spontaneous. It has to come out of your awareness. Nobody can decide it. No catechism can be given according to me.\nI can only teach you awareness and then you find out with your awareness, with your own light where to go, what to do.\nAnything done with awareness is virtue. Anything done with unawareness is sin. Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho. The Invitation Chapter #25\nChapter title: Just go and tell everybody\n2 September 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium Archive\ncode: 8709025\nShortTitle: INVITA25\nAudio:\nYes Video:\nYes Length:\n103\nmins Question 1\nBELOVED OSHO,\nSINCE MY ARRIVAL HERE I HAVE BEEN LIVING INTENSELY, AND I SEE\nTHAT THE PRESENT IS ONLY POETRY.\nI THANK YOU DEEPLY FOR YOUR BEING HERE WITH US. I AM LEAVING IN\nA FEW DAYS AND I FEEL THAT YOU WILL BE EVERYWHERE I GO, BUT I AM\nSCARED OF THE NOISE OF THE WORLD. I DO NOT WANT TO LOSE MYSELF\nTHERE.\nCAN YOU TELL ME SOMETHING?\nDhyan Giovanna, once you have tasted the inner silence, the noise on the outside does not matter; it is not a disturbance at all. The only disturbance comes from your inner noise, the chattering noise inside, the continuous rush of thoughts -- that is the real marketplace. What is outside, is outside; you can pass through the marketplace in absolute silence. If your inner being is not disturbed, then what is\nhappening outside cannot have any impact on you.\nThe fear arises only because we are not certain of our own silence -- our silence is very vulnerable. And in the beginning, it is natural -- it is nothing to be worried about. All that is needed is that the inner silence should be more crystallized. In fact, going into the outer world can be of immense help because it becomes a test. Use it as an opportunity to test your silence. And once you start feeling silent in the crowd, then you will be overjoyed --\nthen you can be certain that this silence is yours; otherwise sometimes one is deceived.\nIn the mountains you can be silent, in the deep forest you can be silent, in the middle of the night under the stars you can be silent -- but that is not your silence. It is just the outer silence penetrating you. In fact, there is no difference -\n- outer silence penetrating you, or outer noise penetrating you -- both are the same; you are under the impact of the outside.\nHence I don't give any value to the silence that you feel coming from the outside. This silence will not be much help; when noise comes, you will be overwhelmed by the noise.\nThe silence has not to be of the mountains, of the stars, of the silence of the deep night, nor the silence of this commune. Here everybody is silent -- at least, trying to be silent!\nWith so many people trying to be silent, one can just become part... But it is the same: you can become part of a commune and feel silent; in the crowd you can become part of the crowd and you will feel noisy. In fact, you are not yet. All your experiences are dependent; you don't exist as an individual. That is the fear; otherwise it does not matter.\nI used to have a friend who was condemned in the whole city -- he was a thief, and you can say he was a master thief. For almost six months he would be in jail, and six months outside. Nobody in the city even wanted to talk to him.\nFrom the jail he used to come directly to my house. He was a very lovable man. And whenever he would come from the jail to my house, naturally everybody in the family was disturbed. My father again and again insisted to me that this friendship was not good.\nI said, \"Why do you believe in him and not in me? Am I your son, or is he your son?\"\nAnd he said, \"What kind of argument are you giving me?\"\nI said, \"I am saying exactly the right thing. You don't believe in me, you believe in him.\nYou are afraid I will be affected by him -- you are not giving even a single thought that I may affect him. Why do you think I am so weak?\"\nHe said, \"I have never thought from this angle -- perhaps you are right.\"\nSlowly, slowly that man became accepted by my family. It took a little time; there were many reasons for them to reject him. The first reason was that he was a Mohammedan; second, he was a thief.\nI had to sit outside the dining room because they would not allow him in the dining room.\nIn a Jaina family, no Mohammedan can be allowed in the dining room. Even for guests or customers, separate plates, glasses, saucers, cups -- everything is kept, but it is kept separate; it is used only for them. And I insisted that when I invited him for food, I was going to eat with him -- I could not insult him. He may be a thief, he may be a Mohammedan, it doesn't matter; I respect his humanity. So the only way was that I would also have to sit outside the dining room. And my friend used to say, \"Why do you unnecessarily continue to fight with your family?\"\nAnd slowly, slowly my respect towards him changed him. He was angry with me, saying,\n\"Your respect prevents me from being a thief, and I don't know anything else. I am uneducated.\"\nHe was an orphan, and there was no other way for him except either to beg or to steal, and certainly stealing is better than begging. Begging degrades you very badly; by stealing, at least you are using your intelligence, your courage.\nHe was angry and said, \"Now my life has become really a problem, and you are\nthe cause. I cannot steal because I cannot betray your trust, your love and your respect. And nobody is ready to give me employment.\"\nSo I took him to my father and I said to him, \"Now my friend wants employment. You are against his stealing, now give him employment; otherwise you will be responsible for his stealing. The poor fellow is ready to do any work, but nobody in the whole city is ready to give him work because he is a thief. People say to him, `Bring certificates from where you have been working. Who has ever employed you ever in your whole life?' And he has no certificates.\"\nI told my father, \"Listen, somebody has to give him work the first time; otherwise, how can he get a certificate? You give him employment, and then you can give him a certificate. And I guarantee that he will not steal and he will not do anything wrong.\"\nOn my guarantee my father employed him. All other friends of my father said, \"What are you doing, giving a job to a thief? He will deceive you.\" But my father said, \"My son has given his guarantee, and I have to give the man an opportunity because my son's reasoning is right: If nobody gives him an opportunity, then everybody is pushing him towards the jail. And the whole society is responsible for pushing him towards the jail.\nHe wants to work, but if nobody is willing to give him work.… What do you want -- that he should commit suicide or what?\"\nOnce a person goes into jail, then it becomes his only place, his home. Then within a few days he is back, because there is nobody outside to give him any protection, any dignity, any respect, any love. It is better to be in the jail.\nHe proved tremendously trustworthy, and finally my father had to accept. He said, \"You are right. I was thinking that I was taking an unnecessary risk. I had not thought that your reasoning was going to work. He is a professional thief -- his whole life has been just going in and out of the jail. But you were right.\"\nMy father was a very sincere man and very truthful; he was always willing to accept his mistakes, even in front of his own son. He said, \"You were right, that I trusted more in him -- I thought he would spoil your life. I did not trust that you might transform his life.\"\nGiovanna, it all depends how much you trust your silence, how much you trust\nyourself, how much the silence is arising from your inner sources. Then there is no problem -- you can go in the noisy world and you will remain silent. And it is possible that you may change a few people you come in contact with. Why trust that they will be able to change you? Why accept your weakness?\nGo in the world with courage and with strength, and the noise of the world will not be a disturbance. And your silence will help people to become silent. Talk about your experience of meditation to your friends, to your family. It is always helpful to provoke in people an invitation, to provoke in people a longing, that they have been missing something that you have attained. And the more you spread your experience and share your experience with people, the more you will be protecting yourself; they will not be able to influence you.\nStart spreading your fragrance and your silence and your experience. That becomes a subtle protection around you, and that also becomes a tremendously transforming force.\nRather than going with fear, go with blissfulness, spreading the experience that has happened to you.\nYou say the present is pure poetry -- that is so valuable; share it. And trust that the higher value is always victorious. The noise cannot win over silence, and misery cannot win over blissfulness, and darkness cannot win over light. These are fundamental rules of existence.\nJust follow these fundamentals and you will be enriched in the marketplace even more than you can be enriched here. Because there, you will become stronger -- you will find the challenge to become stronger. And each time you come, you will come here to refresh yourself, to go deeper, to find greater peaks of consciousness and then go into the world.\nMake it a point that the world has not to be renounced. The world needs people who are silent.\nIn the past, the silent people have deserted the world; they have escaped to the mountains.\nIn my opinion, they were cowards and escapists. They have not helped the world to evolve more, to become more mature, to become more peaceful; they simply escaped just out of fear that the world would destroy them.\nI want my people to go into the world and destroy the world's noisiness, the world's ugliness, greediness. It is a challenge, and it is very exciting. Always remember: the best defense is attack! Attack people with your peace, with your love, with your silence, with your joy -- that's the best defense, and that is a great service to humanity too.\nSid Levensky, aged eighty-three, goes into the confessional at Saint John's Cathedral. The priest asks him, \"Have you anything to confess?\"\n\"Yes,\" says the old man, \"my wife died two months ago. Two days after she passed on I met another woman. She is twenty-two years old. I have been sleeping with her since the day I met her. Sometimes we do it two or three times a day.\"\n\"And how old are you?\" asks the priest. \"Eighty-three,\" Sid replies.\n\"Oh dear!\" says the priest, \"Go home and say ten Hail Marys.\" \"I can't do that,\" says the old man, \"I'm Jewish.\"\n\"Then for God's sake, why are you telling me all this?\" asks the priest. \"Oh, it's not just you,\" replies Sid, \"I'm telling everybody!\"\nSo just go and tell everybody! Question 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nI HAVE BEEN AROUND YOU FOR EIGHT MONTHS NOW, YET I FEEL I RARELY REALLY LET YOU IN.\nWHAT CAN I DO, OSHO?\nPrem Arpana, as far as I am concerned, I would suggest that you don't do anything. It is your effort, your desire that is preventing me being within you because all desire, longing, closes the doors.\nAnd you are asking, \"What can I do?\" If you can do nothing, that will be the best\n-- you just leave this idea. What are you going to do with me inside you? I am perfectly happy wherever I am! And I can help you from the outside more easily.\nAnd this eight months, you say, \"I feel I rarely really let you in.\" It means sometimes, not really, but you let me in. Why are you engaged in this unnecessary mind game? There is no need. It happens, but it happens only when you are not waiting for it; it happens only when you are not making any effort for it.\nIt is one of the most difficult things to understand, that there are things which happen not by your doing, but by your not doing, your sleep -- if you make an effort, then it is impossible. People have been doing all kinds of things: chanting mantras, repeating numbers from one to a hundred and back, from one hundred... ninety-nine, ninety-eight, ninety-seven... to one. And again, going up, coming down, going up, coming down.\nIn fact, all this effort keeps them awake. But these are the suggestions of so- called wise people, who are all around, ready to give advice like, \"Repeat the name of God.\" That will keep you awake! The only thing that can bring sleep is to forget all about it -- do something else, anything will do. Just lying down, what is the harm? Have a good rest, why be worried about sleep? And when you are at ease, with no worry, no chanting, no mantra, no God -- you are just resting\n-- you will find slowly, slowly sleep is coming, enveloping you. You will not know when you have fallen asleep.\nDo you know exactly at what time you enter from waking into sleep? You have been sleeping every day for your whole life, but do you remember, any night, even a single time, the exact moment when you entered into sleep? Even if you look at your watch, sleep will be gone. That much effort on your part is enough to disturb it. Sleep comes only when you have completely forgotten about it.\nAnd this is a vicious circle: people who are suffering from sleeplessness cannot forget it for a single moment, and that creates sleeplessness. And the more they are suffering from sleeplessness, the more difficult it becomes for sleep to come.\nThere are many things in life which need absolute relaxation on your part. They will come when the right moment is there, and the right moment means when you have forgotten them completely.\nIt happens often that you remember somebody -- seeing him, you know him, you know his name, it is just on the tip of your tongue. But why is it not coming out? The more you try...\nIt becomes a very weird experience -- you know, you perfectly know, you are absolutely certain that you know the name, you know the person. There is not the slightest doubt in you, but somehow it is stuck just on the tongue -- it does not come out. It becomes a very strange feeling.\nAnd then you start doing something else. How long can you go on sitting with this strange, weird feeling? You just go in the garden, start digging a hole, planting a tree, or pruning the trees... and suddenly it is there. When you had forgotten completely to remember it, it suddenly comes -- surfaces to your consciousness. But it surfaces only when you have forgotten to remember it.\nThese eight months you must have been trying hard to feel me inside you. In the first place, there was no need. You have to feel yourself; that is the basic thing that you have not done. You don't know your own inside -- how can you feel me inside you?\nJust first do the homework: feel yourself, your interiority, your inner being. And the moment you feel your inner being, you will be so overwhelmed with joy, relaxation, at ease, that there is a possibility you may feel me also within you. You may feel stars, you may feel the sun, you may feel the whole existence within you. But first, feel your within.\nLet me say it this way: If you can feel your within, the without also comes within. You become so expansive, your consciousness becomes so vast, it spreads all over existence.\nIt is one of the most beautiful, most blissful experiences.\nAnd I have no objection if you feel me within yourself -- from my side, I am absolutely willing to come in. But you don't know that the doors of your inner subjectivity are closed. First, get settled inside. Before you invite the guest, please become the host; otherwise, what am I going to do in an empty house? I am a lazy man. Unless you are there to take care of me, I am not coming!\nMax Levensky is dragged out of bed at three a.m. one morning and is hauled before the KGB. He is accused of being anti-Soviet and is then interrogated.\n\"What is the definition of a communist?\" demands the KGB man.\nMax replies immediately, \"Someone who has read the works of Marx and Lenin.\"\n\"And what,\" continues the interrogator, \"is the definition of an anti-communist?\"\nMax thinks for a moment and then says, \"Someone who has read the works of Marx and Lenin and understands them.\"\nYou just try to understand yourself, and then everybody will be coming in -- Marx and Lenin...! But the first thing first. The only thing that can be said is: the basic need is to know yourself, be yourself, and everything else will follow. The understanding of yourself opens the doors of all the mysteries of existence.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nYOU OFTEN TELL US THAT WE SHOULD NOT JUDGE OURSELVES OR OTHER\nPEOPLE.\nI AM A TEACHER AND BECAUSE OF MY JOB I HAVE TO JUDGE THE STUDENTS.\nNOW THAT I AM GOING BACK TO ITALY, I AM WORRIED ABOUT HOW I SHALL MANAGE WITH MY JOB. CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME HELP?\nKalo Shreeman, my saying that you should not judge does not mean that you cannot say to a student, because you are a teacher, \"The answer you have brought is not right.\"\nIt is not judging the person, it is judging the act. And I am not telling you not to judge the act -- that is a totally different thing.\nFor example, somebody is a thief -- you can judge that stealing is not good. But don't judge the person, because the person is a vast phenomenon and the act is a\nsmall thing.\nThe act is so small a piece... that small piece should not become a judgment about the whole person. A thief may have many beautiful values: he may be truthful, he may be sincere, he may be a very loving person.\nWhen I say don't judge a person, I am not saying that you are not allowed to say that somebody is committing a mistake. Somebody is falling into a well -- I am not saying that you should just stand silently without judging. This judgment, \"Don't go that way\" --\nperhaps that man is blind and you have to prevent him; otherwise he will fall into the well. But preventing him, seeing that he is blind, does not mean that you are condemning him. The moment you start thinking in terms of condemnation then judgment enters, and I am against that kind of judgment.\nOne student is doing something which is not right. You are a teacher, your very function is to put the student on the right path. It is your love, it is not your condemnation; it is your compassion, not your judgment. But most often what happens is just the opposite: people start judging the person rather than the action. Actions have to be corrected -- and particularly in a profession like teaching, you have to correct; you cannot allow students to go on doing wrong things. That will be very cruel, uncompassionate.\nI have been a teacher myself, but I have never judged a single student as far as his person, his being is concerned. But that does not mean I have not corrected them if they were wrong. For example, I was sitting one day with the vice- chancellor. He loved to talk with me whenever he could get a chance and could find me, because I was very rarely present.\nAnd most often I avoided passing by his office because he used to tell his peon that if he saw me, to just bring me in. He loved to talk; he enjoyed a good argument.\nI was talking with him, and a girl came crying. So he said to me, \"Just a moment,\" and he asked the girl, \"What is the matter? Why are you crying?\" She said a certain boy, a student in her class had been harassing her for almost the whole year. \"He throws small pebbles at me in the class, he writes letters to me.\" And the vice-chancellor said, \"Don't be worried, I will call him and put him right; such things cannot be allowed. He will be punished, you don't be worried.\nAnd if he does not stop, I will expel him from the university.\"\nI was listening, and I said, \"Just wait a minute. I want to ask the girl a few things.\"\nHe said, \"Of course, you can ask. If you can help in the matter, it will be very good.\"\nI asked the girl, \"Are you really hurt by his throwing pebbles at you and writing love letters to you? Be honest! The day he does not write a love letter to you, don't you wait for it?\"\nThe vice-chancellor said, \"What are you talking about?\"\nI said, \"You just keep quiet. When I am talking, you just be a gentleman -- keep quiet.\"\nThe girl stopped crying. I said, \"Do you understand? If no young man harasses you, will you feel good? Don't you know there are girls who are not harassed by anybody, and they are suffering?\"\nThe vice-chancellor said, \"What are you saying?\"\nI said, \"You keep quiet, I am going to solve the matter completely. I will talk to that boy also.\"\nHe said, \"You need not talk, because the way you are talking...\"\nI said, \"Now I have taken the matter in my hands.\" I asked the girl, \"Are his love letters not written well? Then I can teach him how to write love letters! Because every girl wants love letters -- I don't see that there is anything unnatural in it.\"\nNow the vice-chancellor was boiling! He said to the girl, \"You go away.\"\nI said, \"She can go only when you answer a few questions in front of her. When you were a student, just remember those old days -- those beautiful days. Have you not written love letters to girls?\"\nHe looked at me, he looked at the girl, and he said, \"My God, what...\" For a moment he was silent.\nI said, \"Be honest!\"\nHe said, \"Yes I have written...\"\nI said, \"And just a moment before, you were expelling that boy from the university and you had forgotten completely.\"\nEvery young man will write letters, and if somebody does not write, the function of the teacher is to help him: \"Are you a dodo or what?\"\nAs far as my classroom is concerned, from the very first day I entered after the long summer vacations, my first thing was... because in India the girls sit on one side, boys sit on another side, and in between there is a big space. My first thing was, \"Just get mixed.\"\nThey would look very embarrassed.…\nI said, \"Just get up, and you can choose whomsoever you want, but get mixed! I cannot tolerate this stupidity because this is the cause -- you have to throw stones, you have to write letters... What is the need? Just sit next to each other, and if you want to say something, whisper. Whisper -- I can stop; I can give you time. For fifteen minutes you do whatsoever you want to do. I will keep my eyes closed and meditate, so that after fifteen minutes we can concentrate on the subject matter. This is more primary.\"\nStudents were very much afraid of me. With hesitation they would mix up; still they would sit so that they would not touch each other. I said, \"What nonsense -- do you think each other untouchable? Sit relaxed. And if you want to nudge the girl, or the girl wants to nudge you, it is perfectly okay; nature demands it. And because you are prevented, then you start ugly behavior. Now, taking the air out of the girls' bicycles -- that I don't think is natural! That is sheer stupidity. Harassing them on the road, saying ugly dirty words -- I don't think that is right, nor is it worthy of you.\n\"If you want to say something, write a beautiful love letter. If you don't know how to write, I am here -- I am available. Anybody, male or female, can come to the common room where I sit. I will teach you how to write love letters.\"\nMy class was the most silent class, and I told the vice-chancellor, \"Sometime you can come and you can see -- nobody is doing anything to anybody because\nthey are allowed; I accept it as my responsibility that they should be allowed to be as natural as possible.\nEvery girl should feel that she is loved, desired, that there are people who look at her with loving eyes. Every boy wants to be loved. And this is the time when they should pass through these experiences.\"\nI said to the girl, \"What do you want? Tell me exactly. Do you want the boy to be expelled?\"\nShe said, \"No.\"\n\"Do you want him not to write letters to you?\"\nShe said, \"No.\" The vice-chancellor said, \"Then why have you come here?\"\nI said, \"It is very simple -- she simply wants your attention. She wants to say to the world that she is being loved, somebody is writing love letters, and without telling others there is no joy in the thing. The whole world should know that she is no ordinary girl --\nexceptionally beautiful -- people are throwing stones.\"\nThe vice-chancellor said to the girl, \"Now you go, because listening to such things... he can even spoil me. You just leave the room, and if you don't want to do anything against that boy, never come again.\" And when the girl had gone, he said, \"You should not do such a thing, because if people come to know...\"\nI said, \"In fact, you are afraid of your wife, it is not about people. And I am going to tell your wife that this old man is teaching... in front of me, he has been teaching that love letters are natural.\"\nHe said, \"You were saying natural!\"\nI said, \"You were listening silently! Do you agree with me or not?\"\nHe said, \"I agree, but don't go to my wife -- that is the only woman I am afraid of.\"\nI said, \"Then you have to behave.\"\nJust don't judge so quickly, and don't judge the person. Judge actions, and correct them, and don't correct them according to tradition, convention, according to so- called morality, according to your prejudices. Whenever you are correcting somebody, be very meditative, be very silent; look at the whole thing from all perspectives. Perhaps they are doing the right thing, and your prevention will not be right at all.\nSo when I say, \"Don't judge,\" I simply mean that no action gives you the right to condemn the person. If the action is not right, help the person -- find out why the action is not right, but there is no question of judgment. Don't take the person's dignity, don't humiliate him, don't make him feel guilty -- that's what I mean when I say, \"Don't judge.\"\nBut as far as correcting is concerned: unprejudiced, silently, in your awareness, if you see that something is wrong and will destroy that person's intelligence, will take him on the wrong paths in his life, help him.\nThe job of the teacher is not just to teach futile things -- geography, and history, and all kinds of nonsense. His basic function is to bring the students to a better consciousness, to a higher consciousness. This should be your love and your compassion, and this should be the only value on which you judge any action as right or wrong.\nBut never for a single moment let the person feel that he has been condemned. On the contrary, let him feel that he has been loved -- it is out of love that you have tried to correct him.\nConrad was six years old. Although he was six, he had never spoken a word. His parents took him to the psychiatrist, but it didn't help. But one evening at the dinner table, Conrad looked down at his plate of food and said, \"Take away this muck, it tastes terrible!\"\nHis parents were elated and wept with joy. \"You can talk!\" cried his mother. \"How come you've never spoken before this?\"\n\"Up to now,\" said Conrad, \"everything has been fine!\"\nDon't judge people -- try to understand them. Now he is saying such a beautiful thing:\n\"What is the need to speak when everything is going fine? Only for the first time something is terrible!\"\nA guy lying in a hospital bed, coming around from an anesthetic, wakes up to find the doctor sitting beside him. \"I have got bad news and good news for you,\" says the doctor.\n\"Would you like the bad or good first?\" \"Aaagh,\" groans the guy, \"tell me the bad.\"\n\"Well,\" says the doctor, \"we had to amputate both your legs above the knee.\" \"Aaagh,\" groans the guy, \"that's really bad.\"\nAfter recovering from the shock, he asks the doctor for the good news.\n\"Well,\" said the doctor, \"the man in the next bed would like to buy your slippers!\"\nJust don't be serious! Don't think that you are a teacher so you are in a very serious job.\nLook at life with more playful eyes... it is really hilarious! There is nothing to judge --\neverybody is doing his best. If you feel disturbed by somebody, it is your problem, not his. First correct yourself.\nI have my own way of looking at things.… I was a teacher for nine years, and I never judged a single student. I have never examined a single examination paper, because I told the vice-chancellor, \"If I really examine, nobody is going to pass. And if I am going to pass a few people, why should the others not be passed? So things are clear -- you can decide -- either I can pass everybody, or I can fail everybody.\"\nHe said, \"You always bring strange ideas! I have been a teacher my whole life; this idea never happened to me.\"\nI said, \"This is exactly what I am going to do, so you can decide.\"\nHe said, \"It is better you don't take any examination papers. I will inform the in- charge that you should not be given any papers to examine.\"\nI said, \"That's perfectly right, because that saves me the trouble of judging people unnecessarily.\"\nOnly once they appointed me as a superintendent of the whole examination. I said, \"You are doing something wrong -- you don't understand me.\" That was my first encounter with the new vice-chancellor. I said, \"You don't know me. The old man knew me; he never committed any mistake like this.\"\nHe said, \"What are you saying? Is it a mistake?\"\nI said, \"It is a mistake because you don't know me. But give it a try!\" So he said, \"Okay.\"\nHe came two or three times to see what was happening, and he was feeling terrible when he heard me telling the students, \"Listen, if you have brought notes hiding in your pockets, I have no objection. Just don't be caught. Do it cleverly, watchfully, because it is not a sin -- but you should not be caught. To be caught is the crime.\"\nThe vice-chancellor was standing there, listening. And I said to them, \"I will try my best to catch you. So you decide. I give you two minutes -- if you are afraid of being caught, just bring everything that you are hiding and put it on the table, and I will not say anything to you. But after that, if you are caught, then your whole year is spoiled.\"\nImmediately, students started bringing their notes -- one boy had written answers on his shirt, inside. So he said, \"What am I supposed to do? I have no notes but I have written many things on my shirt, inside -- should I give the shirt?\"\nI said, \"You have to give it.\"\nThe vice-chancellor was standing there. He said, \"What is going on?\"\nI said, \"You keep quiet. I told you beforehand, if I am the superintendent things will be going according to me.\"\nI told the boy, \"You take your shirt off, put it here.\" He said, \"But it is too cold.\"\nI said, \"That's not my problem -- why have you \"\nSo he had to take off his shirt. And the vice-chancellor said, \"This is too much.\"\nI said, \"I cannot help.…\" And nobody was doing anything -- they had even brought books, whole books. They were hiding them behind their coats, shirts, pants, everything came out!\nAnd I said to them, \"Now you can start answering your questions. And don't be worried, if you cannot answer something, I am here; I am here to help you. You can just raise your hand and I will come and try to help you.\"\nNobody raised his hand. I said, \"What is the matter?\" They were afraid, because this has never happened -- a superintendent telling them, \"I will help you.\" I said, \"This is just human. You are in difficulty, and I am sitting here doing nothing \"\nThat was the first and the last time.… The vice-chancellor said, \"You are a strange person.\nThat boy is shivering -- how can he write?\" It was a cold morning the\nexaminations used to be early in the morning, seven o'clock Somebody's pants\nhad been taken, because people used to write on their pants -- people do all kinds of things.\nThey had their ways, and I knew. I have also been a student, and I knew all kinds of things. That was very easy, to write on your pants -- nobody will be able to see. But I told them, \"It doesn't matter, even if you have to sit naked sit naked!\nNext time you will not do such a thing. But I am not uncompassionate to you; if you are in need of some answer that you cannot find, I will give it to you; you just have to raise your hand. Because according to me, all examinations are absolutely absurd.\"\nIf it were up to me, I would allow the students to have all the books available. Only a very intelligent student can find out the answers from the books in three hours. And you will be able to judge their intelligence in a better way; otherwise somebody has just crammed five answers, and he knows nothing else, and he\ncomes first in the class. And somebody else knows everything, just has missed those five questions, and he is a failure.\nThis is not a good examination; they should be allowed to have the whole library available to them. They can go to the library, they can find the answer, they can write it.\nIn three hours, they have to find as beautiful answers as possible. And only intelligent students will be able to find them.\nIn the Soviet Union they have changed this old idea of examinations. Now books are available -- all the books concerned are available in the hall where the students are given their examination; they can consult any book. It is far better, because the ultimate concern is to know the intelligence of the person, not his memory. So students need not memorize anything -- they have to understand things. In examination time they can either just from their intelligence give the answer, or they can look in the books. But if in a five hundred page book you have to find one answer, you need some intelligence -- mediocres will not be able to find the answer, they will become so nervous...\nAnd there is no need that a person should have to wait for one year. I told the vice-chancellor, \"If I am going to be the superintendent I will follow my ideas, I don't care what is conventional. The conventional is not necessarily the right thing. I will give them all the available material; they can find out. Only the intelligent people will be able to find out. And those who have not been successful should be given a chance again after one month. What is the problem that they should wait for one year?\"\nFinally, there is no need of any examinations if every teacher goes on giving marks in his diary every day to the students. And every year, all the notes from all the teachers are collected. And based on those counts the students are moved, either upward or downward. Because there are many who deserve to go back -- they have somehow slipped, they should not be allowed... they should be put back; they should earn better marks and go ahead again.\nAnd this should remain available: if a teacher finds that an intelligent student has unnecessarily to wait six months more for examination, he should recommend that the student be moved right now to a higher class, because he has enough intelligence. There is no need for him to wait six months more. Teachers should\nbe the decisive factors. In that situation, nobody fails, nobody passes -- people simply move. A few move faster, a few move a little slower; everybody according to his pace. Nobody is condemned as a failure, nobody is praised as first-class, nobody is praised as a gold medalist. All these things teach people unnecessary ambition, and ambition is poison.\nYou are a teacher; you should try in every way to change the very structure of teaching, particularly your teaching. And slowly, slowly things move. You should tell other teachers, \"There are many things wrong with the education system itself, which nobody bothers about. And you are judging students; the first thing should be a right system of education.\" The whole system is rotten, old, out of date; it has to be completely changed.\nSo I am not saying don't judge. Particularly systems, conventions, traditions -- judge them! But don't judge individuals. If their actions are wrong, help them to get free of those wrong actions. If they are going in wrong directions, help them to find right paths.\nAnd this should be your love, this should not be your judgment.\n\"Young man,\" said the judge, looking sternly at the defendant, \"it is alcohol, and alcohol alone, that is responsible for your present sorry state.\"\n\"I am glad to hear you say that,\" replied Paddy, with a sigh of relief. \"Everybody else says it is all my fault!\"\nOkay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.\nThe Invitation Chapter #26\nChapter title: You have your problem -- I'm going home 3 September 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium Archive\ncode:\n8709030\nShortTitle:\nINVITA26\nAudio:\nYes Video:\nYes Length:\n133\nmins Question 1\nBELOVED OSHO,\nTHE HARMONY I FEEL WITH YOU, THE VISION OF LOVE AND FLOWERING, TREMBLES WITHIN ME. I FEEL A GIVING OF EVERYTHING TO THIS\nWONDERFUL GIFT OF LIFE. SOMETHING IS HAPPENING THROUGH ME OR\nWITH ME OR IN SPITE OF ME -- AND I KNOW THIS IS HOME. BELOVED MASTER, BELOVED MYSTERY, WHO AM I?\nThe mystery of life always happens in spite of you. In the beginning there is no other alternative possible. Only in the end does it start happening through you. But it can happen through you only when you are not. Then you become a hollow bamboo which can be turned into a flute and the song can pass through it.\nIn the beginning you are -- you are too much.\nSo when the first experience of mystery starts happening it is in spite of you. And it is good to understand that life is far bigger than you can conceive and its power is immense beyond our any conception; just we are waiting patiently, searching patiently, knowing perfectly well that we don't know the way, knowing perfectly well that we have lost our original eternal home -- knowing perfectly well that we are unconscious. All our efforts, our search, our seeking is groping in the dark.\nIt is good to remember our situation. Do your best. In spite of your darkness, blindness, unconsciousness, whatever you can do, do. But remember, it is not going to happen through your doing. It is going to happen because you are longing for it so deeply that existence cannot resist, cannot remain indifferent to you.\nSo although you are not prepared, nobody is prepared. Nobody knows the way, nobody knows where the home is, nobody knows in which direction to move, what discipline to follow.\nBut there are two kinds of people: those who are not aware of their situation of darkness and blindness, and those who think that they are not blind, that they are not in darkness; that they know the way, that they know where they have to go, that they know what they have to do.\nThese are the people to whom existence cannot happen; they are too much. And all that they know is absolutely false, they have not experienced it. But their falsity is so much identified with their being, it is their ego which says, \"You are not blind. There is no darkness and all that is needed you know it through the scriptures, through the old masters, through reading, learning, studying.\" But all that is borrowed; it is not going to help.\nNo two persons reach the end on the same route. Hence Gautam Buddha may have reached through a certain path and Chuang Tzu may have reached through another path, but their paths are no longer useful for you. In fact, it is impossible to find their paths either. Their paths disappear just as the birds flying in the sky don't leave any footmarks.\nSo you cannot find out from where the world has reached to the heights, and you cannot follow because there are no footprints. All there is, is what is written in\nyour scriptures...\nand you try. The Buddhist tries the way Buddha may have followed. In the first place there is no way to find what way he has followed, because the way is inner and nobody is capable of giving an expression to it. So what is written is a faraway echo in the minds of the disciples.\nIt is a strange story to remember that the man who remembered the most of what Buddha has said in forty-two years... And Buddha continuously resisted their efforts to write it down because he did not want to leave any scripture behind nor did he want to leave any statue of himself. He wanted to disappear just as if he has not come. One of his names is Tathagata. It has two meanings; both are significant. One is: the man who taught the philosophy of suchness. The other is more literal but has a tremendous significance.\nLiterally the word `tathagata' means just came, just gone, leaving no mark behind, just like a breeze comes you feel it and the coolness of it, and it is gone. Neither do you know from where it comes nor you know where it goes.\nSo for his whole life Buddha did not allow his statements to be compiled. And in the end he said to them, \"No statue, no memorial should be made of me because I want to disappear as if I had never been. Because whatsoever is left behind becomes the hindrance for people; it does not help them.\"\nThere is a great insight, very profound -- and such egolessness, such simplicity, such humbleness that he wants to disappear silently without any footprints, because nobody can follow anybody else. Nobody can become wise by reading and studying scriptures.\nSo that greater part of humanity which believes that they know, they are the ones to whom the mystery is not going to happen. But if you are searching, knowing perfectly well that you know nothing -- you don't even know that your ignorance is absolute; it is not that a little bit you know and a little bit you don't know -- in this humbleness, in this acceptance that I don't know, the mysteries start happening. They happen in spite of you.\nYou cannot manage -- they are not manageable, they are not under your control -\n- but once they start happening they make their way through you.\nSlowly, slowly the ice of your ego melts and a passage is made. Existence starts\nsinging its songs, sending its music, giving you directions; helping you to find the doors of all that is mysterious and is not available to the mind but only to the man of heart, to the man of humbleness -- to the man who is perfectly aware that he knows nothing.\nAnd it is good that you ask, \"Beloved Master, beloved mystery, who am I?\"\nYou are Swami Satyadharma. This much you should remember; otherwise in the ordinary life you will get lost. Once you forget that you are Swami Satyadharma then you don't know where you are going and what you are doing.\nI have told you two small stories...\nOne is about George Bernard Shaw. He is traveling in a train from London to some place and the ticket checker comes. Bernard Shaw looks into everything, opens this suitcase, that suitcase, all the pockets, and the ticket is missing. He starts perspiring and looks very much afraid and concerned.\nThe ticket checker says, \"I know you; everybody knows you. The ticket must be somewhere; there is no problem. You will find it. Don't get so nervous and excited in your old age\" -- he was ninety.\nThe ticket checker said, \"I will not disturb you, I am going. You just relax.\"\nGeorge Bernard Shaw said, \"You don't understand. It is not the question of the ticket.\nWho is bothering about the ticket? The question is where am I going? Can you tell me where I am going? Without the ticket... now I have got into a tangle. I am not searching for the ticket for you -- I don't care about you or anybody. But the problem is: Where am I going?\"\nThe ticket checker said, \"My God, that is impossible for me to figure out where you are going. Now I can understand why you are feeling so nervous. Your hands are trembling.\"\nThe second anecdote is about Mulla Nasruddin in the same situation as George Bernard Shaw. The ticket checker is asking for the ticket and he is looking everywhere. Other passengers are puzzled that he looks into every pocket but he leaves one pocket. He does not touch that one.\nFinally, the ticket checker said, \"You have looked everywhere but you don't look into this pocket.\"\nHe said, \"Don't talk about that pocket. That's my only hope and I don't want to destroy that hope. If it is not there I'm finished. Then it is nowhere else. So I cannot open that way. I will look everywhere possible...\"\nHe had thrown all the clothes and everything out of the suitcases. The ticket checker was at a loss, the passengers were at a loss. But Mulla was absolutely reluctant, \"Whatever happens, I am not going to touch that pocket. That I will leave because at least there is a hope that perhaps the ticket is there. If the ticket is not there then I am completely finished.\"\nThe problem is the same: I don't know where I am going. So as far as the world is concerned, you are Swami Satyadharma -- and there are two Swami Satyadharmas here.\nRemember, you are not the other one. To make it clear, the other one is German; so don't get mixed.\nJust as you call me Beloved Master, beloved mystery, I call you beloved disciple, beloved mystery. Behind Swami Satyadharma everything is a mystery. Satyadharma is just a facade for the outside world, just a utilitarian identity; it is not your reality; but behind it is a mysterious being. You are becoming aware of gifts of existence, of mysteries. Something is happening through it; just allow it.\nYour function is not to prevent, not to be reluctant. Join your hands with whatever is happening. That's what I mean by let-go.\nLet existence cleanse you. Allow it total power over you.\nDon't be worried that you will be destroyed, because you will be destroyed. There is no need to worry; it is absolutely certain. When things are certain there is no worry. It is only the uncertainty that creates worries.\nYou will be destroyed.… That which will remain undestroyed in you is your authentic self. That which is destroyed is your personality, your false self; it needs to be destroyed.\nYou can use that destroyed part in the world because they won't understand if you say that you are a mystery. Even your family, your wife, your children, your parents will think you have gone mad if you say, \"I am a mystery.\" Nobody is a mystery and only you are a mystery? -- where did you lose yourself?\nSo as far as the outside world is concerned you are Swami Satyadharma -- not the other one; that you have to remember! This is a problem for sannyasins because they have the same names, many. You can get lost and start thinking, Who am I? And naturally, you are a mystery, but a German mystery or an Italian mystery... this much you should remember: that you are not a German mystery.\nFor the outside world, completely keep your old false identity, your name, your profession, your qualifications. But inside you will know that it is only utilitarian, not real, useful; useful in the society, but when you are alone you are not Swami Satyadharma and you are not Italian or German or English.\nYou are not even your body. You are not your mind.\nYou are just the pure mystery behind.\nNow there is no way to describe it, you will have to experience it, and you are moving rightly towards that experience. Just don't in any way knowingly out of fear hinder the process. There is no fear: only the false will die and the real will remain always and always. That is the definition of the real: That which remains.\nThe false is just useful. In the crowd of the world you need a name. The reality is nobody has a name, but it will be a very difficult world if everybody drops the name because it is false. Then you won't have any address. The postman cannot find you anywhere because everybody is a mystery! You will create troubles because you are not the husband and you are not the wife and you are not the father and you are not the child -- everything outside will be disturbed, will become a chaos.\nOutside keep everything as it is. Inside don't be identified with it.\nThis is the whole secret of finding yourself without being condemned by the\nsociety as mad.\nA traveling salesman was just on the point of checking into a hotel when he caught sight of a stunning young woman who was without doubt giving him the full come-on treatment. He strolled over to her and nonchalantly exchanged a few words with her, behaving as though he had known her all his life. Then they both walked to the reception desk and booked in as man and wife. After a one- night stay, the salesman went to collect his bill and check out. He was appalled to be presented with a bill for one thousand pounds.\n\"Look here, this is out of the question. I have only been here for one day,\" he cried.\n\"Yes sir,\" replied the receptionist, \"but your wife has been here a month.\"\nSo don't get into such trouble. On the outside remain exactly what you are, Swami Satyadharma.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nYOU ADVISE WATCHING PATIENTLY THE UNTANGLING OF THE GORDIAN\nKNOT THAT TIES ME TO THE PAST. SOME PART OF ME IS HAPPY TO DO\nTHAT; ANOTHER PART WANTS YOU TO SLASH THE KNOT ASUNDER. IS\nTHIS LAZINESS OR MASOCHISM OR A MIND TRIP?\nIt is not masochism, Prem Rajiva, nor is it a mind trip. You are sincerely wanting to get out of the entanglement. You want to be free of all entanglement; you want to come out of the prison. What you are calling the Gordian knot, you want it to be slashed.\nIt is a sincere and authentic desire, but the trouble arises because this desire is also from the mind. So one part of the mind is ready to cut the Gordian knot and\nanother part of the mind is always against. It is not a special question about the Gordian knot that divides you.\nMind's functioning is through duality. The right word used for that is `dialectics'. Karl Marx has used that word as a foundation of communism. He calls his philosophy dialectical materialism. He says the society evolves through dialectics, and by dialectics he means it will be helpful to you for your development -- and what he says has some truth in it.\nThe meaning of dialectics is that one part functions as the thesis, another part functions as the antithesis and out of the conflict of the two comes the third part, a synthesis.\nSynthesis on its own accord becomes again thesis and creates antithesis, and their conflict brings a new synthesis. This is how step by step evolution happens.\nAnd he is right, although he used his philosophy to support a political ideology. That is fictitious, but the idea of dialectics in itself is absolutely correct.\nHe says that the proletariat, the poor are the thesis, and the rich, the capitalists are the antithesis. Now there is going to be a class struggle, a revolution, a fight between thesis and antithesis that will create the dictatorship of the proletariat as the synthesis. On its own then it will become the thesis and it will create its antithesis as democracy of the proletariat. And out of the conflict between the two will arise another synthesis.\nEvery man's capacity to think is limited. That synthesis never becomes thesis. He has come to the end of his row; he has arrived at a state where there is no class, no government. He has achieved the utopia. Now there is no need of any conflict, any revolution. But I don't see that evolution is going to stop anywhere. So he has used a very significant principle of philosophy for his political ideology. And as he reaches to his ultimate goal he forgets all about dialectics. That is not only his fault -- everybody's. The religions say God created the world, and when you ask them who created God -- finished.\nThey have come to the end of their row.\nThe Jainas in India say that man has been evolving, not in his physiology as Darwin thinks -- that in physiology he is evolving from apes or monkeys or gorillas -- but Jainism says man is evolving through different animal\nconsciousnesses, not physiologically but in his soul. It seems more accurate than Charles Darwin. Charles Darwin does not have any evidence.\nThe whole thing seems to be hypothetical because nobody has seen any monkey, because if in the past, thousands of years ago, some monkey became a human being, why are other monkeys not becoming human beings now? They are now more evolved as man has evolved. Now they will be jumping every day! Suddenly you see a monkey, and he jumps and becomes a man and says, \"Hello, where are you going? I am coming too.\"\nNobody has encountered any monkey becoming a man. And the difference between a monkey and man is so great that it cannot be possible to take a jump suddenly. Monkeys know how to jump, but that does not mean they can jump and become a human being.\nThey can jump from one branch to another branch -- that's perfectly okay -- but they cannot jump from one state of consciousness into a totally new state of consciousness, because it needs a new brain, a different size of brain; it needs a different structure of the body. Just to stand on two legs a monkey will need so much bodywork that he will not survive.\nIt has happened in Lucknow...\nA boy was found who had been raised by wolves in the forest, and just the other day a girl was found. She was the same age, thirteen, and she had been raised by animals. So the boy and girl walk on all fours -- naturally, they have imitated their parents.\nIt has happened in Calcutta too. They tried to make him stand on two legs, thinking that the man should be restored to humanity -- they killed him. Just the effort to make him stand on two legs was so difficult because he now had a fixed structure. For fourteen years he had walked on all fours; now suddenly he could not stand.\nAnd the same happened in the Lucknow case: in six months they had killed the boy. I put the whole responsibility on the stupid idea that these people should be restored. They were perfectly beautiful; there was no need. This boy who was killed in Lucknow by the scientists and the doctors... They were giving him all kinds of medicines and injections and bodywork and massage. And the boy was so strong that they needed four or five people to catch hold of him; otherwise he\nused to run faster on his four feet than any runner. He could have come first in any Olympic race anywhere; he was a wolf.\nIt would have been more humane to leave him back in the forest. But this is how the unconscious mind functions. Now a girl has been found in Europe and they have immediately started working on her to restore her. They will kill her. I can predict it --\nbecause this \"restoration\" is not possible; it would take a lifetime.\nAs for the Lucknow boy, in six months the whole success for the scientists and the doctors was that he learned one word: the name Ram that they had given to him. That was their whole success -- and they enjoyed very much, that they had done \"great service.\" All they did... There are five billion human beings, what is the point of taking a beautiful wolf back into humanity, and rejoicing that he has learned the name Ram?\nAnd thousands of people were coming -- he had become an exhibition -- to ask him,\n\"What is your name?\" And he would say, \"Ram\" -- with anger. According to his mind, it was purely torture because traction was being done.\nSuddenly a monkey cannot become... And Charles Darwin also was looking for a middle link. The monkey must have become first a middle link between man and monkey, and then from middle link he may have moved to monkey. He never could find any middle link; his hypothesis remains hypothesis.\nAll these philosophers go on using some idea. Once they get attached to it they extend it into a philosophy, into a whole system. That's what Marx did. But dialectics is a natural phenomenon, particularly as far as man's psychology is concerned: mind functions through dialectical ways.\nYou will never find mind without any split.\nI keep coming across very intelligent people.… I wanted one of our sannyasins who is a very intelligent legal expert, to come here -- and there is no problem in coming. His wife is also as educated as he is. They were both colleagues in law college, his wife was a magistrate. He has been in the commune. The wife had also come, but because they had a small child she went back and took a job as a\nmagistrate. Now that her husband has gone back to join her, she has dropped out of her job. So I told both of them they could come here. He informed me that ninety percent he wants to come, but ten percent of his mind thinks of security, safety; the child, his education, old age, the future...\nI have come across such people all my life, and I have asked them only one thing: If you are intelligent enough, then why are you choosing the ten percent part of your mind against the ninety percent? You are not realizing at all that you are choosing ten percent of the mind -- and you are afraid to choose the ninety percent.\nAnd mind is never going to be a hundred percent for anything. That is not the way mind functions, it is out of the question. Mind's function is always to be divided on every question: a thesis, antithesis, and then you have to find out the synthesis, and you have to function according to the synthesis.\nSo there is no problem about your being a masochist; you are not on a mind trip either. It is simply the way of the mind that it never functions as a total unit. In fact, if you see the dialectics in life you will find it in many places. You walk, that is dialectical. If both your legs move together one hundred percent you will fall down. Fifty percent remains static, fifty percent moves. Then the other fifty percent becomes static and the static part starts moving. That's how you walk; that is dialectical philosophy. That's how a bird flies; that's how you use your hands.\nEven your mind is not one single piece; it has two hemispheres. Your right hand is connected with the left side of your mind and your left hand is connected with the right side of your mind. So if something goes wrong with the left side of the mind, for example paralysis, then your right hand will be paralyzed.\nBoth have different functions. The right side of the mind thinks and the left side of the mind feels, and thinking and feeling are just like two legs. They cannot join together; otherwise there will be no progress in life. You will remain static.\nSo it is simply a matter of not understanding the nature of mind. You have one part of the mind ready -- let it go and do its job. That is the moving leg, and the other part is the static part. And you think that you would like me to slash the knot asunder. I cannot do that because I love you.\nOnce I started doing things for you, you would become dependent on me. And\nthat is the last thing that I will tolerate. I would not like you to be dependent on me. I can give you the way, I can show you the way, but I will not walk for you. You will have to walk yourself, because I want you to be absolutely independent and free. Today I am here, tomorrow I may not be here.\nIf you become dependent on me, as has been happening all over the world for centuries --\npeople become dependent on the masters, and the masters enjoy the dependence. Neither are the masters authentic nor are the disciples intelligent -- and humanity has remained static.\nAre you aware of the fact that for centuries there has been no evolution? If monkeys have become human beings at some time, what have human beings done? -- they are stuck. At least some daring human being should take a jump and start flying, do something! But you know perfectly well that if you try flying, there will be no evolution, only multiple fracture.\nIt has happened to a few people under LSD or under impact of some drug -- particularly LSD gives these ideas that you can fly. And one woman flew out from an eighty-storey building, from the eightieth floor. She simply flew out of the window. And you know what would happen... so it happened.\nLSD is a very harmless drug, but it should be used under medical supervision, because it gives such ideas, great ideas, and the mind is no longer functioning so there is no opposition; there is a\none hundred percent surety -- and that is very dangerous. A one hundred percent surety is not favorable to evolution. It is good that the mind should be divided for and against, discuss, argue, and slowly slowly progress.\nBut one thing is strange, that for at least one million years there has been no evolution as far as man is concerned. You cannot call this evolution: one person becomes a Gautam Buddha or one person becomes a Bodhidharma or one becomes a Tah Hui -- you cannot call that evolution. The whole of humanity is stuck somewhere.\nWhat is the problem? The problem is, humanity is not moving with the part of the mind which is for evolution; it is staying with the part of the mind which is not for evolution.\nYou have to learn only one thing, that you have already a part of your mind ready, happy to do that. So do it! Don't bother about the other part of the mind. That mind is pulling you back; it represents your past. And the mind that is feeling happy and excited to do something, it represents your future. Choose the future.\nDon't depend on somebody else, because that dependence is dangerous. It is not only one question that can be solved, there are a thousand and one questions -- and your evolution depends on your own readiness to risk, your own acceptance of danger.\nYou are in a right position; there is no problem. Just listen always to the part of the mind that is for the future, that is for the unknown, that is for evolution, and the other part will come following behind.\nOnce you are decisive, the other part of the mind will immediately follow you. It will remain against you until you are decisive. And the decision has to come from looking at the fact of which mind is for the future and evolution, which mind is going to give you a better life, a better understanding, a better consciousness -- choose that and the Gordian knot will be slashed without any effort on your part or without any need from outside help.\nA woman leaned over her side of the fence and asked the little boy next door how he was getting on with his new stepfather.\n\"Great,\" he replied, \"every morning he takes me out in the boat to the ocean, puts me in the water and then I swim back to the beach.\"\n\"But is not that a bit dangerous for a little boy?\" asked the woman.\n\"Oh, that's easy. The hard part is untying the knot and getting out of the bag.\"\nIt is certainly a little harder... but if you can manage to do it, it will give you a sudden quantum leap for a higher consciousness.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nYOU OFTEN TALKED ABOUT PSYCHOANALYSIS AND RELATED\nTHERAPIES.\nWOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT ON MORE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS LIKE\nFRITZ PERLS' GESTALT THERAPY AND -- THE LATEST FASHION -- VOICE\nDIALOGUE? CAN THESE THERAPIES HELP A PERSON WHO IS ALREADY\nMEDITATING TO SEE HIMSELF AND HIS GAMES MORE CLEARLY?\nTilo, in the first place psychotherapies like Fritz Perls' Gestalt therapy and others are already old; they are not new. The only new thing which is the latest fashion is Voice Dialogue -- but they are all just mind games.\nThey cannot contribute anything to a man who is already meditating -- no psychotherapy has the quality of meditation, because no psychotherapy has produced a single enlightened being. Their founders were not enlightened and the enlightened beings in the East never bothered about any psychotherapy. They have not even bothered about psychology or mind itself, because for them the question was not to solve the problems of the mind, for them the question was how to get out of the mind which is easier. Then the problems all are finished, because once you are out of the mind, the mind has no nourishment to go on creating problems; otherwise it is an unending process.\nYou get psychoanalyzed, whether old or new fashions it doesn't matter; they are just variations of the same theme. Your mind feels a little fresh and good after a psychological session, because you have unburdened yourself. A little understanding of mind also comes -- that keeps you normal.\nIn fact, all psychotherapies are in the service of the establishment; their function is not to let people go abnormal. Somebody is going outside the herd and the norms of the herd and doing things which it is not supposed that you should do...! They may be harmless but the society cannot tolerate such people. They have to be brought to the normal, to the average standard.\nThe psychotherapist's work is to clean your mind. It is a kind of lubricating your mechanism -- it functions a little better and you start becoming a little more\nunderstanding about the functionings of the mind, although that does not make any revolutionary change. And it is possible you may solve one problem, but you have not removed the cause.\nMind itself is the problem.\nSo you can remove one problem, mind will create another problem... It is just like pruning the trees: you prune one leaf and just out of self-respect and dignity the tree will grow three leaves in the place where there used to be one. That's why gardeners go on pruning; that gives trees more foliage, more leaves.\nThe same is the situation with the mind: you can remove one problem by understanding it\n-- and it is costly -- but the mind is still there which has created the problem, and psychoanalysis does not go beyond the boundaries of the mind. The mind will create a new problem, more complicated than the one that you have solved. Naturally, because the mind understands you can solve that kind of problem, it creates something new, more complicated, more foliage.\nMeditation is a totally different thing than psychoanalysis or any therapies which are confined to the mind. It is simply a jumping out of the mind: You have your problems --\nI'm going home.\nBecause mind is a parasite it does not have its own existence. It needs you inside in it, so it can go on eating you, your head. Once you jump out of it, the mind is just a graveyard.\nAll those problems that were too big drop, they simply drop dead.\nMeditation is a totally different dimension: you simply watch the mind and in watching you come out of it. And slowly, mind with all its problems disappears; otherwise the mind is going to create strange problems.\nThe other day in England a court released a murderer. It is a very strange case, and it may give impetus to many people to murder. The murderer was in the second world war fighting in Japan. And he pleaded in the court that in the night he dreamt that the Japanese were chasing him, and they were just about to get\nhold of him. He became so frightened and he wanted to survive, so he caught hold of the neck of one Japanese and killed him by pressing on his neck. And as the Japanese was killed, he awoke from the dream and the Japanese was no one but his wife.\nThe court was in a difficulty what to do, because he had not done it consciously, in awareness. Now to punish him does not seem right, even in a traditional England, where anything new takes years to be accepted. When the whole world will accept it then England will try!\nThe judge must have been a man of great understanding, but he has also opened a door of dangers. Now anybody can kill his wife and say, \"What can I do? Japanese were following...\" It is a precedent that you have released one man, acquitted completely from committing any crime.\nNow you are able to commit crime. You just have to pretend that you are asleep, and there is no way for the court to find out whether you were really asleep and the Japanese were really following you in your dream. The poor woman was fast asleep, he jumped up and killed her -- and perhaps he is right... But now there will be cases which will not be right. Perhaps what he is saying is true; he has been in the war in Japan and that may have come as a dream from his unconscious; and out of fear, to protect himself, he started fighting with the Japanese. And there was nobody else in the room except the wife close to him just on the bed, so he jumped, caught hold of the Japanese...\nMind is your only problem.\nAll other problems are just offshoots of the mind. Meditation cuts the mind from the very roots.\nAnd all these therapies -- Gestalt and Voice Dialogue and Fritz Perls -- we can use them for those who have not yet entered into meditation just to have a little understanding of the mind so they can find the door from where to get out.\nWe are using all kinds of therapies which are helpful, but not for the meditators. They are only helpful in the beginning when you have not yet become accustomed to meditation.\nOnce you are meditative you don't need any therapy, no therapy is helpful then.\nBut in the beginning, it can be helpful, and particularly for the Western sannyasins.\nI don't suggest it much for Eastern people that they should do therapy groups. For example, Japanese have been found not to understand that in an encounter group if people are fighting it is just playful fighting. They really start fighting and they can become dangerous; they can kill somebody.\nDifferent cultures... Japanese have been writing letters to me saying that in the therapies they are telling us that you hate your mother, your father -- and it is absolutely wrong!\nWe will kill the therapist! Japan has a totally different culture. The very idea that you hate your mother -- and the person will commit hara-kiri. He will kill himself because it is so shameful.\nI have come to know such stories of hara-kiri that you cannot believe. One famous historical case happened three hundred years ago. A very well-known master of martial arts forgot, when he went to meet the emperor, to bow down. In Japan you have to bow down even to your enemy when you go to fight.\nBoth bow down to each other because one never knows who will be left alive. At this moment enmity and friendship don't matter. At this moment when one person is never going to be seen again and will not even be able to ask for forgiveness, they give respect.\nAnd it is authentic, it is not formal.\nGoing to the emperor and forgetting to bow down... And he forgot because he was a great master and thousands of people who were learning under him were all bowing down to him. So he had become accustomed to people bowing down to him, and then he would respond by the same gesture. It was such bad manners that when he was made aware that he had committed a great crime because he had not bowed down to the emperor, he committed suicide.\nThat is the routine process. There is no other way except that to show that you really feel repentant. It is not so easy as in the West where you can just say, \"I'm sorry\" -- that is very formal and very easy. Japanese take things very seriously. The only way you can say, \"I'm sorry\" is by hara-kiri -- one feels so ashamed of himself that he cannot allow himself to live anymore.\nThe more strange thing is that his three hundred intimate disciples committed hara-kiri because their master had behaved in a shameful way. They were not at all concerned, but because their master has fallen in grace, how can they stand in the world with grace and dignity? Three hundred disciples committed hara-kiri. This is a historical fact, and this kind of thing has been happening in Japan for centuries.\nSo one sannyasin has written to me, \"The therapist goes on insisting, `You must hate your mother...' Either I will kill the therapist or I will kill myself if he is right. Because I don't see that I have ever hated my mother.\"\nAnd in fact the situation is different. In Japan almost one-third of the girls don't marry; they remain with their mother. In the rest of the world the situation is different. And what psychoanalysis has found does not apply to the Japanese. It applies only to the Western mind and its upbringing.\nSigmund Freud is right only about the Western mind and its tradition. When he says that every girl hates her mother because she loves the father, the whole thing is based on their understanding of sex, that one loves the opposite sex. So girls love the fathers, the boys love the mother. But the girls cannot express their love, particularly they cannot be sexually related with the father, and the mother is related sexually. So they become jealous of the mother -- the mother is their enemy. The boys become enemies of the father and because of that the boy cannot make love to the mother.\nThe Japanese cannot even think of this; even Indians cannot think of this -- just a totally different upbringing. Indians cannot believe what kind of nonsense this is. And for the Japanese things are very difficult. If you insist and you convince him that he hates his mother or he hates his father -- and the whole psychoanalysis depends on these kinds of things: who you hate, why you hate... And they go on digging deeper and they prove to the person that from very childhood there has been a jealousy and that is creating all the problems.\n\"Why can't you love your wife?\" -- the psychoanalyst will come to the conclusion that you wanted to love your mother -- and your wife is not your mother -- and the wife does not love you because she wanted to love her father and you are not her father. So you are bound to fight continuously. You have fallen in love with the girl because something in her resembles your mother. And the girl has fallen in love for the same reason: something in you resembles her\nfather.\nSo you have married your mother; she has married her father. This is psychoanalysis.\nAnd because neither she is behaving like your mother nor you are behaving like her father, problems arise.\nBut to say to a Japanese, \"You have married your mother,\" is simply out of the question.\nTo say to an Indian, \"You have been secretly loving your mother and you wanted a sexual relationship with her...\"; he cannot even think...\"Are you in your senses or...\"\nIn India the tradition is that the son loves his mother almost like a goddess. He loves his father and respects his father next to God. And the difficult thing is that even the people in the East who are teaching or who are in the profession of psychoanalysis, as professors or as practitioners, they have all learned from the West and they don't understand that the East has a totally different orientation.\nAnd Sigmund Freud or Jung or Adler or Assagioli or Fritz Perls have no idea. Not even in their dreams have they thought that people can be different from the Western people.\nIn the East psychoanalysis is not of much help. For the Westerners, I like them to go through groups just to clean the mind. With a clean mind, to enter into meditation is easier. But if you don't enter meditation and you simply depend on cleaning the mind, then you will be cleaning the mind for your whole life and you will not go anywhere else.\nBecause of its different orientation the East should find seats in the universities for meditation, not for psychoanalysis.\nOne of the great Indian psychologists who was the head of the department in the Hindu university of Varanasi belonged to a village near my village; and moreover, he was father-in-law to one of my friends who had studied with me. He was one of the most respected professors of psychology, but he was condemned by everybody because people, thinking that he would be able to help them with their mind problems, would go for psychoanalysis, and\npsychoanalysis brings... They would ask, \"Whom do you hate?\"\nAnd the Indian would find himself at a loss because everything comes down to sex -- and the Indian cannot accept that idea. It is not the same orientation as in the West.\nThis man's name was Laljiram Shukla. And because his son-in-law was my friend, the son-in-law was continuously telling him that he must meet me at least once. He was an old man. I was just out of the university. He invited me to come to Varanasi because his son-in-law was continually praising me. It became a psychological problem for the psychologist that the son-in-law was more interested in me, and not interested in him and was continually praising me. It became a challenge to him.\nI was not aware what the situation was. When he invited me I thought perhaps it was because of my friend; he may have talked about me, so I went. I was a guest in his house, and I immediately became aware of a certain tension.\nI asked my friend, \"What is the matter?\"\nHe said, \"The problem is that I have been talking about you not knowing that he was feeling very offended. But he never showed it, and now, because you are here -- and many other professors have become interested; all his students, nearabout twenty postgraduates, they are all coming in the morning to meet you\n-- he is feeling very much wounded.\"\nSo in the morning he exploded. He started arguing with me, and because I told him, \"All your education is from the West; all that you are talking is simply nonsense in the East --\nwhat do you know about meditation? All your knowledge is about the mind, and that too of a certain mind, the Western mind. You are betraying the East by teaching people all kinds of nonsense, which does not make any actual impact on them, because that is not their problem.\n\"I have never seen anybody, I have looked in so many people's minds... In the East nobody is jealous of the father, nobody wants to make love to the mother, but without these things the psychoanalyst will say, Ìf you want to be cured you will have to cooperate.'\"\nAnd I argued with him -- I had to because he was so angry with me that I could not understand why he had invited me. And because he could not answer, I asked him directly, \"I ask you, have you ever in your childhood wanted to make love to your mother? Have you ever thought in your childhood to kill your father because he was your competitor for the same sex object, the mother?\"\nHe cooled down, and he said, \"Never. I never thought about these things.\"\nI said, \"What are you doing now? Imposing on people ideas which are not their problems, are you helping them or destroying their integrity? You are telling them that their problems are things which are not their problems.\"\nIn the East for centuries the problem has been how to get beyond the mind -- the only problem, the single problem. But for the Western mind, because it has developed in a different way, it has never thought about transcending mind. I have looked into Jewish sources, into Christian sources; there is not a single statement in the whole history of the West where somebody has made an effort to go beyond the mind.\nThey have used the mind to pray, they have used the mind to believe in God; they have used the mind to become religious, virtuous, but they have never even thought that there is a possibility of going beyond the mind.\nIn the East that has been the only, single search. The whole genius of the East has been working for one thing, no other problems: how to go beyond the mind. Because if you can solve your problems wholesale just by going beyond, then why go for retail solving of problems. The mind will go on creating; it is a very creative force. You solve one problem, another problem arises. You solve that problem, another problem arises.\nIt is a good business for the psychoanalyst, because he knows you are never going to be cured. You are not going to be cured of the mind; he cures your specific problems. Your mind is there, the source. He never cuts the roots, he only cuts leaves, branches at the most, but they go on growing again -- the roots are there.\nMeditation is cutting the very roots of problems.\nI repeat: the mind is the only problem, and unless you go beyond the mind, you will never go beyond problems.\nIt is strange that even today, the Western psychologists have not even pondered over the fact that the East has created so many enlightened people. None of them has bothered about the analysis of the mind.\nJust as in the Western literature -- religious, philosophical, theological -- there is no idea of going beyond the mind, in the same way in the Eastern philosophical literature there is nowhere any mention that psychoanalysis or psychology is of any importance. The West has lived with the mind and the East has lived beyond the mind, so their problems don't seem to be the same.\nUgly things can happen when you impose. For example, Erhard was running the movement of EST -- and it looks stupid to the Eastern meditator. What he was trying to do is so hilarious, but people felt very good. You will also feel very good if you do it, without paying him the two hundred and fifty dollars fee for you to become enlightened.\nAnd how you become enlightened is a very simply process.\nYou are not allowed to go to the bathroom, so your bladder goes on becoming more and more filled with... and it starts hurting -- and you are not allowed to go to the bathroom.\nAnd the session continues from the morning till night. The whole day to contain yourself, to resist the temptation...!\nIn such a situation who is listening to what nonsense he is talking? You are trying to hold yourself so that in some unaware moment... And then it starts happening, because how long can you do it? Particularly women don't have any control on the bladder; man has a little control, but women don't have.\nSo one woman starts pissing -- and when one starts... And Erhard used to say, \"That is great!\" And she feels certainly immensely relieved. First you created the tension and the tension became too much; it became anguish, agony. And now, she feels so released: It is enlightenment.\" She says, \"I have got it\" -- and then follows a chain... Somebody else starts getting it, somebody else starts getting it\n-- they used to fill the whole hall with urine. And they have paid two hundred and fifty dollars -- you can do it on your own!\nIf this is enlightenment, just close your room, and if you need some help it can be very easy; your friend can tie you so you cannot go to the bathroom. Then,\ncontain yourself as long as you can and there comes a moment when you cannot contain. Then the bladder simply takes over. You are simply surprised by what is happening. And such a great relaxation and relief follows, such peace that you have never known -- peace that passes understanding!\nThese idiots have been creating new fashions in psychology, in psychoanalysis, therapies\n-- and earning millions of dollars, and cheating people. It is not enlightenment. And if this is enlightenment then there is no need to be enlightened. It is perfectly good to go to the toilet... forget all about enlightenment.\nThe East has never bothered about the mind, has not even taken any note of it, has ignored it. From Patanjali to Gautam Buddha, to Shankara, to Ramakrishna, to J.\nKrishnamurti -- the whole tradition does not bother about the mind. The mind is mentioned only for one purpose: how to transcend it.\nHundreds of methods have been found which can help you to transcend the mind, and once you are beyond the mind all its problems look as if they are somebody else's problems. You attain to a state of a watcher on the hills, and all the problems are in the valleys. And they don't have any impact on you; you have gone beyond them.\nThe West has remained utterly mind centered. In the West the only thing they have thought about is matter and mind. And matter is the reality and mind is only a by-product; beyond mind there is nothing.\nIn the East matter is illusory, mind is a by-product of all your illusions, projections, dreams. Your reality is beyond matter and mind, both.\nSo we divide reality in the East into three parts: matter, the outermost; the soul, the innermost; the mind is in between the two. Matter has a relative reality; it is not absolutely real, just relatively real. The mind is absolutely unreal, and the soul is absolutely real.\nThis is a totally different categorization of humanity. In the West the categories are simple: matter is real, mind is just a by-product, and there is nothing beyond mind.\nSo remember, Tilo, if you are meditating then nothing else is needed. If you are not meditating, then these psychotherapies may be helpful as a stepping-stone for meditation.\nIt was sunrise, and the young athlete was doing push-ups on the beach when a drunk appeared.\nThe drunk weaved his way to within a few yards of the perspiring young man, sat down on the sand and laughed and laughed.\n\"What the devil are you laughing about?\" asked the annoyed young man. The drunk laughed and said, \"Don't look now, but somebody stole your girl.\" Unnecessarily doing push-ups...\nThe West is unnecessarily making tremendous effort in analyzing the mind -- utterly useless unless they accept a transcendental state. And that's why again and again they get cheated by frauds. For example, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is cheating the whole of the West by any stupid thing. First it was transcendental meditation, then people became fed up with it because it was not meditation; it was mind repeating a mantra. You were not going beyond the mind, so what is transcendental in it?\nSo his earnings became very low; he had to invent something new. So he has invented spiritual yogic flying. First he started by spiritual levitation: you can meditate and become so light that you will start rising upwards! -- and you can find idiots everywhere... And people were paying four hundred dollars for learning spiritual levitation. In the first place what are you going to do by... even if you levitate, what purpose is going to be served by it? In the second place nobody was levitating; people were hopping.\nTrick photography was being used and spread. People were shown to have levitated, and they had levitated with their mattress also -- that was strange. The mattress also has become yogic, spiritual...!\nHe was continually asked, \"Give a public demonstration of your levitation\" -- and he could not. A case was brought in the Supreme Court of America by seven of his own disciples, who had been working hard on levitation and found that it was absolute nonsense -- they were just hopping! So they had brought a case\nagainst him, demanding ninety million dollars. He has been cheating the whole world, and he has accumulated tremendous money.\nMaharishi Mahesh Yogi dropped that idea because he could not give a public demonstration. He came with a new idea, and this new idea is yogic flying -- even greater. And what is the purpose of yogic flying? -- if one person can learn to fly, then ninety-nine persons in the world will become meditative and silent and peaceful.\nA big business, because it means for five billion people to become peaceful -- no war, no conflict, just blissfulness -- millions of people will have to learn yogic flying. Again, he was aware that he would be asked to give a public demonstration. He has given one demonstration in Europe, and now another is planned in America soon. And what people saw was, it was the same hopping, but now it is hopping not only in one place, you go on hopping...\nEvery frog knows it! And it is so stupid that people are paying millions of dollars to learn what the frogs know without any difficulty. They are giving public demonstrations and they don't even see that they are being absolutely stupid. A few have become so expert that now there are hurdle races; small hurdles are places and they hop over the hurdles.\nThey are great spiritual people.\nBut I don't see the connection. Even if they can hop, and go on crossing the hurdles, in what way is this going to create peace in the world...? Nor can it create peace in the person who is hopping. It will create more retardedness in him. The very idea that he has accepted this stupid thing shows that he has no intelligence at all. And what peace, how can peace be attained by these kinds of things?\nHe is now proposing to the world that if millions -- he has calculated exactly how many millions of people are needed to learn hopping to prevent the third world war.\nI don't believe that man is so stupid that he gets caught by such frauds. People are learning. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi has opened an academy in Switzerland where thousands of people are learning hopping.\nThe West is being exploited by all kinds of frauds for the simple reason that the\nWest has not looked into the matter of meditation itself. So any idiot goes and says anything, and gathers followers because they don't know what meditation is. Neither will chanting a mantra nor hopping nor levitation...\nThese things have nothing to do with meditation. Meditation has only one meaning, and that is going beyond the mind and becoming a witness. In your witnessing is the miracle -\n- the whole mystery of life. Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho. The Invitation Chapter #27\nChapter title: Still time to change the trains\n4 September 1987 am in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium Archive\ncode: 8709040\nShortTitle: INVITA27\nAudio: Yes Video: Yes Length:\n107\nmins Question 1\nBELOVED OSHO,\nI AM ALSO GETTING OLD. WOULD YOU TELL ME A FEW LAWS FOR MIDDLE\nAGE ALSO?\nAmrito, everybody is getting old. Since the day you were born, you have been getting old\n-- each moment, each day. Childhood is a flux, so is youth -- just old age never ends, because it terminates! That is the unique quality of old age, that it brings you to ultimate rest. But you want a few laws for middle age... You are a man of medicine, you should know better.\nAs far as I am concerned, I have never been a child, never a youth, and never become old and never will die. I know only one thing in me that is absolutely unchanging and eternal.\nBut just for your sake...\nThere are many laws about middle age, because all over the world people become old.\nAnd many thinkers have been thinking, What is this old age? The first law is De Never's Lost Law; obviously about old age, the law can be the last: Never speculate on that which can be known for certain.\nYou know perfectly well you are getting old, now don't speculate on that, that will make you more miserable.\nThe law is beautiful, never speculate on that which can be known for certain. In fact, in life, except death nothing is certain; everything can be speculated upon,\nbut not death.\nAnd old age is just the door to death.\nMiddle age is when you begin to exchange your emotions for symptoms.\nLendel's Law: You know you are getting old when a girl calls \"No,\" and all you feel is relief.\nOld age is when you start to turn out the lights for economical rather than romantic reasons!\nOld age is that period of life when your idea of getting ahead is staying even. Old age is when you can do just as much as ever, but would rather not.\nOld age is a mysterious experience, but all these laws have been found by the Western mind. I have not been able to discover anybody in the whole literature of the East talking about old age. On the contrary, old age has been praised immensely, because in the East it has been thought that you are not old. If your life has simply moved on the horizontal line, you are only aged. But if your life, your consciousness, has moved vertically, upwards, then you have attained the beauty, the glory of old age. Old age in the East has been synonymous with wisdom.\nThese are the two paths: one is horizontal, from childhood to youth, to old age and to death; another is vertical, from childhood to youth, to old age, and to immortality. The difference in quality of both the dimensions is immense, incalculable. The man who simply becomes young, and old, and dead, has remained identified with his body. He has not known anything about his being, because being is never born and never dies; it is always, it has been always, it will be always, it is the whole of eternity.\nOn the vertical line the child becomes young, but the youth on the vertical line will be different from the youth on the horizontal line. Childhood is innocent, but that is the point from where these two different dimensions open up. The youth on the horizontal line is nothing but sensuality, sexuality and all kinds of other stupidities. The youth on the vertical line is a search for truth, is a search for life\n-- it is a longing to know oneself.\nA man on the vertical line cannot be called young if he is not meditative, and the same is true about old age. On the horizontal line, old age is simply trembling, afraid of death; I cannot think of anything except a graveyard, and darkness which goes on becoming darker and darker. It cannot conceive of himself except as a skeleton.\nOn the vertical line, old age is a celebration; it is as beautiful as man has ever been.\nYouth is a little foolish -- is bound to be; it is inexperienced, but old age has passed through all the experiences -- good and bad, right and wrong -- and has come to a state where it is no longer affected by anything concerned with body or mind.\nIt is a welcome! old age on the vertical line is keeping its door open for the ultimate guest to come in. It is not an end, it is a beginning of a real life, of an authentic being.\nHence, I continuously make the distinction between growing old and growing up. Very few people have been fortunate to grow up; the remainder of humanity has only been growing old. And naturally they are all moving towards death. Only on the vertical line does death not exist; that is the way to immortality, to divinity. And naturally, when one becomes old on that dimension, he has a grace and a beauty and a compassion and love.\nIt has been noted again and again... There is a statement in Buddhist scriptures that as Buddha became older, he became more beautiful. This I call a true miracle. Not walking on water -- any drunkard can try that. Not turning water into wine -- any criminal can do that. This is a true miracle: Buddha became more beautiful than he was in his youth; he became more innocent than he was in his childhood -- this is growth.\nUnless you are moving on the vertical line, you are missing the whole opportunity of life.\nBut here our whole effort is to block the horizontal line and open the blocked vertical line. Then every day you are coming closer to life, not farther away. Then your birth is not the beginning of death, your birth is the beginning of eternal life. Just two different lines and so much difference.\nThe West has never thought about it; the vertical line has never been mentioned because they haven't been brought up in a spiritual atmosphere where the real riches are inside you. Even if they think of God, they think of him outside. Gautam Buddha could deny God -- I deny God. There is absolutely no God for the simple reason that we want you to turn inwards. If God is -- or anything similar -- it has to be found inside you; it has to be found in your own eternity, in your own ecstasy.\nTo think of oneself as a body-mind structure is the most dangerous idea that has happened to people. That destroys their whole grace, whole beauty, and they are constantly trembling and afraid of death, and trying to keep old age as far away as possible. In the West, if you say to an old woman, \"You look so young,\" and she knows she is no longer young, she will stand in front of the mirror for hours to check whether any youthfulness has remained anywhere. But she will not deny it, she will be immensely happy. In the East, nobody says to an old woman, \"You are young\"; on the contrary, old age is so respected, loved, so that to say to somebody, \"You look younger than your age,\"\nis a kind of insult. .\nI am reminded of one incident that happened life...\nI was staying in Chanda -- a far corner of Maharashtra -- with a very rich family, and they were very much interested in an astrologer. They loved me and I used to go at least three times per year. That was their quota, and I used to stay there for at least three or four days each time. Once when I went there, without asking they had arranged with the astrologer to come and to look at my hands and tell some things about me. When I came to know about it, everything was fixed; the astrologer was sitting in the sitting room. So I said,\n\"Okay, let us enjoy that too!\"\nI showed him my hand; he pondered over it and he said, \"You must be at least eighty years old.\"\nOf course, one of the daughters of the rich man freaked out, \"This is stupid. What kind of astrology...\"\nAt that time I was not more than thirty-five -- even a blind man could have measured thirty-five and eighty! She was really angry, and she told me, \"I am\nfinished with this astrologer. What else can he know?\"\nI said, \"You don't understand. You are more Westernized -- educated in the Western style. You have been to the West for your education -- you can't understand what he was saying.\"\nShe said, \"What was he saying? It was so clear there is no need to understand; he was simply showing his stupidity. A thirty-five-year-old young man, and he is saying that you are eighty years old.\"\nI said, \"Be patient.\"\nAnd I told her a story about Emerson...\nA man asked Emerson, \"How old are you?\"\nEmerson said, \"Nearabout three hundred and sixty years.\"\nThe man could not believe... and he had always believed in Emerson that he is a man of truth! What had happened -- a slip of the tongue? Or had he become senile? Or is he joking?\nTo make things clear he said, \"I did not hear what you said. Just tell me how much...?\"\nEmerson said, \"You have heard it -- three hundred and sixty years.\"\nThe man said, \"I cannot believe it. You don't look more than sixty years.\"\nEmerson said, \"You are right in a way: on the vertical I am three hundred and sixty, and on the horizontal I am sixty.\"\nPerhaps he was the first Western man to use this Eastern expression of horizontal and vertical.\nEmerson was immensely interested in the East, and he had a few glimpses which bring him closer to the seers of the UPANISHADS. He said, \"Actually I have lived sixty years; you are right. But in sixty years I have lived as much as you will not be able to live even in three hundred and sixty years. I have lived six times more.\"\nThe vertical line does not count years, it counts your experiences. And on the vertical line is the whole treasure of existence -- not only immortality, not only a feeling of divineness, but the first experience of love without hate, the first experience of compassion, the first experience of meditation -- the first experience of the tremendous explosion of enlightenment.\nIt is not a coincidence that in the West, the word ènlightenment' does not have the same meaning as in the East. They say that after the black ages, dark ages, came the age of enlightenment. They refer to people like Bertrand Russell, Jean- Paul Sartre, Jaspers as very enlightened geniuses. They don't understand that they are misusing a word, dragging it into the mud. Neither is Bertrand Russell enlightened nor Jean-Paul Sartre nor Jaspers.\nEnlightenment does not happen on the horizontal. Even in his old age Jean-Paul Sartre was still running after young girls. Bertrand Russell changed his wife so many times, and he lived long on the horizontal -- almost a century. But even in his old age, his interests were as stupid as young people.\nThe East understands that the word ènlightenment' has nothing to do with genius, has nothing to do with intelligence, it has something to do with discovering your real, authentic being. It is discovering God within you.\nAmrito, you need not be worried about laws. Those laws are all on the horizontal line. On the vertical line there is love, no law; there is the growing experience of becoming more and more spiritual and less and less physical, more and more meditative and less and less mind, more and more divine and less and less of this trivial material world in which we are so much enmeshed.\nOn the vertical line, slowly you feel desires disappearing, sensuality disappearing, sexuality disappearing, ambitions disappearing, will to power disappearing... your slavery in all its aspects disappearing -- religious, political, national. You become more of an individual. And with your individuality growing clear and luminous, the whole humanity is becoming one in your eyes -- you cannot discriminate.\nThere are great experiences on the vertical line; on the horizontal line there is only decline. On the horizontal line the old man lives in the past. He thinks of those beautiful days, those Arabian nights when he was young; he thinks also of those beautiful days when there was no responsibility and he was a child running\nafter butterflies. In fact, for his whole life he has been running after butterflies -- even in old age.\nMulla Nasruddin was passing along a street...\nAnd he saw a beautiful young woman so he gave her a good nudge. The woman was shocked, because Mulla was old; all his hairs were pure silver white. The woman said,\n\"You should be ashamed -- all your hairs are pure white. You are the age of my grandfather -- you should have been dead by now. You are showing your ugliness.…\nMulla said, \"Listen, my hairs are white, that's true, but my heart is still black -- dark black.\"\nOn the horizontal line, that's what happens -- your hairs will become white, but you don't become white. In fact, on the contrary: as you grow old, you become more and more infatuated by desires, because now you know that ahead there is only death. So you enjoy as much as possible, although enjoying becomes difficult, physically you have lost the energy. So the old man on the horizontal line becomes cerebrally sexual; he is continuously thinking of sex.\nPsychologists have been watching thousands of people, and they have concluded that every man thinks of a woman at least once in three minutes. Just check it! That will show you on what line you are -- horizontal or vertical. And each woman thinks of a man one time in seven minutes. That is the difference that creates conflict. The moment the husband comes and asks, \"Dear, what about it?\" and she says, \"I have a headache, don't torture me any more...\" The difference is that she thinks of it only one time in seven minutes, that means one day in seven days...!\nThe man thinks of the woman one time in three minutes, that is average. In old age those three minutes shrink into one minute. The old man has nothing else to do but to think --\nand what else is there to think about? He imagines beautiful women.\nOne day Mulla Nasruddin was sitting on his balcony watching the beautiful sunset...\nAnd suddenly he shouted to his servant, \"Bring my glasses, bring my glasses quickly!\"\nThe servant said, \"What calamity has happened?\" He brought his glasses.\nMulla said, \"You idiot, when I say quick it mean quick. We missed the opportunity.\"\nThe servant said, \"I don't understand, what opportunity?\"\nHe said, \"Such a beautiful woman was going by, but my eyes can't figure out whether she is a woman or a man, whether she is really beautiful or I am imagining. Glasses were needed, but by the time you brought the glasses she was gone.\"\nThe servant said, \"You are under the wrong impression; she was not a woman! He is my brother who has come to see me. Nobody else has passed.\"\nThe old man is continuously thinking of the past -- this is the psychology. The child thinks of the future because he has no past; there is no question of thinking of the past --\nno yesterday. He thinks of days to come, the whole long life. Seventy years gives him space... He wants to become big enough quickly to do things that all the big people are doing.\nThe old man has no future -- the future means death; he does not even want to talk about the future. The future makes him tremble. The future means the grave\n-- he talks about the past.\nAnd the same is true about countries. For example, a country like India never thinks of the future. That would mean it had become old; it is symptomatic. It always thinks of the past. It goes on playing the life of Rama and Sita; for centuries the same story... every village performs that drama. It goes on thinking about Buddha and Mahavira and Adinatha and RIGVEDA and the UPANISHADS.\nEverything has passed. Now the country is simply waiting to die; there is no future.\nAccording to the Indian idea -- and that is the idea of the old mentality, the mind of the old man -- the best age was millions of years ago; it was called satyuga, the age of truth.\nAfter that man started falling.\nYou can see the psychological parallel; there are four ages: childhood, the young man, middle age, the old man. According to these four he has projected four ages for life itself.\nThe first age was innocent, just like a child -- very balanced. They give the example that it has four legs just like a table, perfectly balanced. And then the decline starts.…\nIn India, the idea of evolution has never existed, but on the contrary just the opposite idea. The word is not even used in the West -- you may not have even heard of the word -\n- but in India they have been thinking about involution, not evolution: \"We are shrinking, we are falling down.\"\nIn the second stage of the fall one leg is lost; the table becomes a tripod. It is still balanced, but not as much as it was with four legs. In the third stage it loses another leg; now it is standing only on two legs, absolutely unbalanced. And this is the fourth stage: even two legs are not available; you are standing on one leg -- how long you can stand?\nThe first stage is called satyuga, the age of truth; the second is simply named by the number; treta is the third, because only three legs are left. The second is called dwapar.\nDwa is exactly what two is in English; this `two' comes from the Sanskrit dwa; moving through many other languages it becomes twa, and then finally it becomes two. And the fourth age they have called kaliyuga, the age of darkness.\nWe are living in the age of darkness. This is the mind of the old man: ahead there is only darkness and nothing else. The child thinks of the future, of the golden future; the old man thinks of the golden past. But this happens only on the horizontal line. On the vertical line, the past is golden, the present is golden, the future is golden; it is a life of tremendous celebration.\nSo rather than being worried about the laws of old age, think about which line your train is moving on. There is still time to change trains; there is always time to change trains because from every moment that bifurcation is available. You can shift, shift from the horizontal to the vertical; only that is important.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nCAN YOU SAY SOMETHING AGAIN ABOUT COMING TO THE MASTER AND\nGOING BACK TO THE WORLD?\nAgain?\nChetan Dhyan, it seems you have heard it before. Where were you that time? And are you certain you will be able to hear this time?\nI can say... in fact I am saying everything again and again and again, but you are not ever at home so you don't know. You think I am saying new things every day\n-- from where can I get new things? I have stopped reading; for twelve years I have not touched a single book. I don't meet people, so I can't gather gossips or gospels. I don't go anywhere. I just talk to you and go to sleep!\nIn sleep do you think I can find new things every day? My sleep is dreamless, contentless\n-- just a pure silence. It is another name for meditation to me.\nNirvano just takes care that once in a while I sleep, or else the body suffers; otherwise the whole night I am awake. I have divided the day into two parts because there is nothing to read. I have read so much, and now I am utterly bored when I come to look at books. I already know what these idiots will be writing. And there is no other source.…\nThe only thing is that you feel what I am saying is new, that you have never heard it before. You have been here, but I will not refuse your question. I will repeat it again! But before I say anything about it, to wake you up I will tell you a story. I use stories and jokes to keep you awake! If I start talking about pure\nphilosophy there will be complete silence and people will start snoring!\nFor centuries people have been snoring whenever religion, spirituality, philosophy and meditation were discussed. And all the great masters have been in immense agony because of their compassion -- what to do with these people? But I have found a way: there is no need to say to you, \"Wake up!\" I simply tell you a joke when I see you are slipping into sleep. Then you just straighten up, open your eyes, look all around -- I don't allow anybody to snore!\nA man from Warsaw in Chelm on a business trip, was walking down the street when he was stopped by Yossel the chimney sweep. \"Zalman!\" cried Yossel. \"What has become of you? It's so long since I have seen you. Just look at yourself.\"\n\"But wait,\" replied the stranger, \"I'm...\"\n\"Never mind that,\" said Yossel. \"I can't get over how much you have changed. You used to be such a big man, built like an ox. And now you are smaller than I am. Have you been sick?\"\n\"But wait,\" replied the stranger, \"I'm...\"\n\"Never mind that,\" said Yossel. \"And what has become of your hair? You used to have a fine head of black hair, and now you are completely bald. What has happened? You know, I don't see how I ever recognized you. Zalman, what has become of you?\"\n\"I have been trying to tell you,\" the man replied. \"I am not Zalman.\" \"Oy,\" replied Yossel, \"You have gone and changed your name as well!\" If one does not want to listen, what to do! You will find some way out.\nYour question is beautiful. You say, \"Can you say something again about coming to the master and going back to the world?\"\nThe moment you have found a master, wherever you are the master will be with you.\nFinding the master means drinking from his well.\nFinding the master means becoming yourself -- so attuned with the master, so in accord, in such a deep harmony, that you only appear two, but you have become one. The bodies are two, but the inner flames of your life have become one. Once you have found the master, there is no way to go anywhere where you can be without the master.\nIf going to the world you find yourself alone, without the master, that simply means only one thing, without any doubt -- you have not found the master yet.\nThere is a beautiful story about Mahakashyapa, one of the most significant disciples of Gautam Buddha -- perhaps just second to him, or maybe just equal to him. He never asked any question, he never bothered Buddha about any problem. Finally, Buddha became concerned, \"What is the matter? Everybody is asking, everybody is receiving the answer, and this Mahakashyapa never asks anything. And if he does not ask there is no point in answering him -- what am I going to answer?\"\nHe called Mahakashyapa. With tears, Mahakashyapa came to him and he said, \"The only thing is that I am afraid of enlightenment.\"\nBuddha said, \"You are strange. You have left your kingdom and you have become a sannyasin, and now you are afraid of enlightenment?\"\nHe said, \"That's true, that's why I don't ask anything, because I am afraid if I become enlightened you will send me away to spread the message, the word. I have been watching; those people who have become enlightened have been sent away, and I cannot live a single moment without... Just leave me alone. I don't want any enlightenment, I just want to be with you. And I can be with you only if I am unenlightened; once I am enlightened I know you will send me.\"\nBuddha said, \"I promise you, I will not send you. But just out of that fear, don't prevent yourself from becoming enlightened -- you don't know what it is!\"\nBecause of the promise of Gautam Buddha, Mahakashyapa became enlightened on the second day. All this time he had been becoming silent, peaceful -- no question, no answer; the chattering of the mind had gone away. For twenty years he had been sitting in deep closeness with Buddha, and his love for him was so much that he was ready to drop the idea of enlightenment.\nYou will find very few disciples who will be ready to drop the idea of\nenlightenment.\nThey will say, \"This is stupid. For enlightenment we have come to a master, and then for the master we drop the idea of enlightenment! It does not make sense.\"\nBut once Buddha promised him, the next day he became enlightened. And Buddha called him, \"Mahakashyapa, now you have to go and spread the word.\"\nMahakashyapa said, \"And what about your promise?\"\nBuddha said, \"A promise was given to an unenlightened man! You are no longer the same man; that man has gone. To you I have never given any promise.\"\nMahakashyapa said, \"That's true. That man is gone, but be kind enough... Forget about the promise because you are tricky, you are getting out of it. Let me be here.\"\nBut Buddha said, \"What will you do here? Don't you know that once you have become enlightened, wherever you are I am with you? I am you. What is the difference between my enlightenment and your enlightenment? Just a day ago you were an unlit candle; today you have your own flame -- and the flame is the same. Today you are a buddha yourself.\"\nMahakashyapa touched his feet and said, \"I will go, but just allow me one thing, that wherever I am I can bow down towards your direction and touch your feet. Your feet will not be there, but I can touch the ground and kiss the ground. This much you will have to allow me.\"\nBuddha said, \"I can allow you. There is no harm in it, but what will others think? They will think you are crazy. First you are going to talk about meditation, enlightenment --\nthey will think you are a little strange -- and when they see you kissing the earth and touching the earth with your head then it will become certain to them that you are really mad.\"\nMahakashyapa said, \"That you can leave to me. That is my problem; you should not interfere in it. First you tricked me into enlightenment -- for twenty years I was so happy.\nNow I am more happy and more blissful. For twenty years I was happy in spite of my ignorance, now I am happy, simply happy -- there is no ignorance, there is no darkness. I am grateful to you. I know you are within me now, but whatever the world thinks I will continue to touch your feet -- at least from far away, just in your direction.\"\nAnd his whole life he continued. People were amazed seeing him every morning, every evening, \"What are you doing?\" But he was such a luminous figure, nobody could think that he was mad. In fact, they had never seen such a man of genius, intelligence, awareness, love, compassion, blissfulness -- twenty-four hours in ecstasy. So they could not think that he was mad, but what was he doing?\"\nHe said, \"I bow down to my master's feet. He must be a thousand miles away, just in the direction... I cannot forget my gratitude towards him. If he had not tricked me I would have remained unenlightened forever.\n\"Just for me to become enlightened, my master was even ready to lie. He promised me --\nknowing perfectly well that he was not going to keep his promise -- and he is a man of his word; I have never seen him going against his word. But his compassion was so much, and his love was so much, how can I forget him?\n\"It does not matter where he is I bow down in gratitude morning and evening, and that is my most precious time. I am blissful, I am ecstatic, I am enlightened.\"\nBut I want you to know that he said to people again and again, \"Even my great ecstasy is less than the ecstasy I feel when I bow down to my master. Whatever I am is his compassion and nothing else.\"\nChetan Dhyan, you need not be worried if you have found the master in me. Then wherever you are you will find me very close, nearby -- just following you like a shadow.\nBut if you get lost into the world, that will also be a good experience, to understand that you have not found the master. In any case, these are the only two alternatives -- either you will find me in your gratitude, in your love, in your peace, in your silence, in your meditations, in your joy, or you will forget about me in the crowd. In both of the ways it will be a beautiful experience and a\nbeautiful test.\nI want everybody here... those who are essential to run the commune should remain here; otherwise, people should come and go. They can manage it to be here for three months --\nbe here three months and go back into the world.\nThe day you can start finding me wherever you are is the greatest day of your life.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED MASTER,\nLOVING TO HEAR YOU LAUGH, LOVING YOUR JOKES, LOVING YOU\n--\nBELOVED MASTER, WOULD YOU SPEAK TO US ABOUT LAUGHTER?\nAnand Svabhavo, when you are hungry you don't want somebody to speak on food!\nWhen you are in a river drowning, you don't want somebody else to talk about the art of swimming. There are right moments and right situations, and there are things which can be talked about, yet misunderstood.\nLaughter is a mystery. It is better to experience it than to hear someone talk about it. But one becomes curious, \"What is laughter?\"\nLaughter is the most intelligent factor in you.\nBuffaloes don't laugh, and if you meet a buffalo laughing you will go mad! Then it will be impossible to bring you to sanity. No animal laughs. Laughter needs a very sensitive intelligence. It means that you can understand the ridiculousness of a certain situation.\nWhat are jokes? They are a very clever arrangement. They take you in a direction logically, rationally, you start expecting that now this is going to happen, this is going to happen... and it goes on happening according to your\nexpectations. Then comes a sudden turn and something happens which you could never have imagined. That brings laughter to you.\nIt is a very internal process of your rational expectation. If what you were expecting happens, there will be no laugh. But if you see something that you could not have conceived and everything went well up to the end -- and then suddenly something happens that makes you immediately forget all your reason, logic, mind...\nLaughter is the only ordinary experience when you are no longer a mind, and I use it to give you glimpses of no-mind, of meditation, of a transcendence of mind. Perhaps I am the first man in the whole history of mankind who has been using jokes as a preparation for meditation. Jesus would not laugh; Buddha will not laugh; Lao Tzu is not heard to have ever laughed... They were serious people, and they were doing serious work!\nIt will be good to understand a small incident which began the tradition of Zen. Those are the people who understand -- the only people on the earth, a small stream who have understood the meaning of laughter because their origin is in laughter.\nIt was again Mahakashyapa...\nHe was sitting under his tree -- he was sitting under his tree for twenty years. It had almost become his tree; nobody else used to sit under that tree. Everybody knew that that was the place for Mahakashyapa and not to disturb that man. \"He never asks, he never says anything, he never talks -- why disturb him? Just leave him alone.\" It had become an accepted fact. But one day he laughed -- and that day was his day of enlightenment.\nA great king, Prasenjita, asked his wife... His wife was a disciple of Gautam Buddha, a lay disciple, not a sannyasin, but immensely interested in Gautam Buddha and hoping that one day her husband would allow her to become a sannyasin. Prasenjita was not interested in sannyas; he was interested in increasing his kingdom, to make it bigger and bigger. He was always fighting, invading new areas.\nBy chance, Buddha had come into the capital of Prasenjita, and the wife was insisting,\n\"You have to come with me to welcome him because it doesn't show culture, refinement if you don't come. A man of the caliber of Gautam Buddha happens in millions of years.\nKings and queens are a rupee a dozen! You can find them anywhere; they are not worth much. You will be forgotten, but Gautam Buddha's name will remain till the last man has become enlightened. You may be remembered if you go to Gautam Buddha and touch his feet. Just this small act on your part will make you historical\".\nAnd that is true -- who would have heard about Prasanjita? There were hundreds of other kings at that time, and we don't know anything about them, but Prasanjita is known. And because the wife was insistent, he said, \"Okay, but I have to present something to him.\"\nHe had a very beautiful diamond. Other kings were jealous of that diamond; perhaps that was the best diamond available in those days. So prasenjita said, \"What else can I offer to him? I will offer this diamond.\"\nThe wife said, \"You don't understand, a diamond or a stone is equal to him. It will be better that you take a lotus flower, because to him the lotus flower represents a revolution\n-- it comes out of dirty mud. And it is the most beautiful flower on the earth, most fragrant, the biggest flower. It comes from the dirt, it crosses the water and stands on top of the water. This is a great revolution: dirt turning into such a beautiful...\n\"So velvety are the flowers, leaves and petals that when dewdrops in the night gather on the big petals and big leaves, they are so velvety that the water cannot touch them. They remain on the lotus leaves, but the lotus leaf remains untouched by them. The lotus flower remains in the water but the water does not touch it -- that gives it another significance that a man should live in the world untouched by it. He should live in the world but not allow the world to enter him; he should live in the dirty world, but he has the possibility of becoming a lotus flower.\"\nSo the lotus became a symbol for the transcendence from the trivial matters of the world.\nGautam Buddha is represented in thousands of temples sitting on a lotus flower. That lotus flower represents his philosophy -- it has become a symbol. So she said, \"In our beautiful pond at the palace I will find the best and biggest lotus flower -- you take the lotus flower.\"\nThe husband did not think that a lotus flower had any value in comparison to his diamond which could purchase a whole kingdom. So he said, \"Okay, I will take both, and I will see which he prefers. This is my first meeting, so let me judge the man.\"\nHe touched the feet of Buddha and wanted to give the great diamond. Ten thousand disciples were present. They could not believe the radiance of the diamond, its clarity, purity, its perfection -- and it was so great. There was complete silence, because everybody was watching what Buddha was going to do now, because it was against his disciplines to have anything more than three changes of clothes and one begging bowl --\nthat had to be the only possession for any sannyasin. Now what was he going to do...?\nWas he going to refuse the king? -- that will be insulting. Was he going to accept it? --\nbut that will be against his discipline. So there was great silence and great curiosity.\nBuddha saw the diamond and told prasenjita, \"Drop it!\"\nVery reluctantly, he dropped it, because now there was no way... He has presented, and the man is saying \"Drop it.\" Under the impact of Buddha and those ten thousand people -\n- in which there were nearly two dozen enlightened people -- he dropped the diamond.\nThen he brought from the other hand the lotus flower, thinking that perhaps his wife was right.\nBuddha said, \"Drop it!\"\nprasenjita could not believe what kind of man he was, \"I have brought presents and he goes on saying, `Drop it.'\"\nThe third time, when he had dropped the lotus flower, his hands were empty, but Buddha said loudly, \"Drop it!\"\nHe said, \"I don't have anything to drop.\"\nThat was the moment when Mahakashyapa for the first time in twenty years started laughing, madly. prasenjita was very much offended, but Gautam Buddha called Mahakashyapa gave him the lotus flower, and told him, \"From you will start a totally new and unique, fresh stream.\"\nThat fresh stream has developed into Zen -- but it was born in the laughter of Mahakashyapa.\nprasenjita said, \"I don't understand what is happening... why this man laughed.\"\nGautam Buddha said, \"He laughed because you could not understand my third request to drop it. I wanted you to drop your ego. I am not concerned with lotus flowers, not concerned with diamonds. I only am concerned with one thing, your ego. Unless you drop it, you have not dropped anything. And I cannot accept your diamond or your lotus flower, because that will enhance and nourish your ego.\n\"That's why Mahakashyapa laughed because the poor emperor does not understand the language of a mystic -- but he understood it. In ten thousand sannyasins he was the only one who understood what I meant -- and he laughed. I have chosen him to be the first for a new stream of seekers, so he is the founder of Zen.\"\nZen was founded in laughter, and for twenty-five centuries the tradition has continued to produce enlightened people. Most of the traditions have died but Zen still brings flowers.\nPerhaps, rooted in laughter, it is rooted in the highest consciousness. Anand Svabhavo.…\nRabinovich sits down in a cafe and orders a glass of tea and a copy of PRAVDA.\n\"I'll bring the tea,\" the waiter tells him, \"but I can't bring you a copy of PRAVDA. The Soviet regime has been overthrown and PRAVDA isn't published anymore\" -- PRAVDA is the mouthpiece of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\n\"All right,\" says Rabinovich, \"Just bring me the tea.\"\nThe next day Rabinovich comes to the same cafe and asks for tea and a copy of PRAVDA. The waiter gives him the same answer.\nOn the third day, Rabinovich again orders tea and PRAVDA. This time the waiter says to him, \"Look, sir, you seem to be an intelligent man. For the past three days you've ordered a copy of PRAVDA, and three times now I've had to tell you that the Soviet regime has been overthrown, and PRAVDA isn't published anymore.\"\n\"I know, I know,\" says Rabinovich. \"But I just like to hear it.\" Two Jews sat in a coffee house discussing the fate of their people.\n\"How miserable is our lot,\" said one. \"Pogroms, plagues, quotas, discrimination, and Adolf Hitler... Sometimes I think we'd be better off if we'd never been born.\"\n\"Sure,\" said his friend. \"But who has that much luck -- maybe one in fifty thousand?\"\nTry to get it!\nIt was at the office Christmas party. As they lay on the office reception couch in the darkened room, their breath came hot and fast.\n\"Oh, Melvin, oh Melvin,\" she said passionately, \"You've never made love to me like this before. Is it because of the holiday spirit?\"\n\"No,\" he panted. \"It is probably because I am not Melvin!\"\nIt is possible, when you have a hearty laugh, mind stops, because mind cannot laugh. It is structured seriously, its function is to be serious, miserable, sick. The moment you laugh, it does not come from your mind, it comes from the beyond, from your very inner spirit.\nAccording to me, all the religions have missed one of the dimensions of the greatest importance, a sense of humor. And they have made the whole world serious.\nI want my people to fill the world with laughter, joy, songs, and dances. We are not seeking for any paradise -- we are seeking how to create the paradise, herenow, because we are not interested in things after death. If we can create a paradise herenow, certainly we will be able -- even if we meet in hell -- to create the paradise there.\nAll my people are condemned by all the religions, so I hope we will be reaching hell. But they are to be warned, \"Don't send my people to hell, because they will turn the hell into a far better paradise than you have with your old, dirty and dry saints who cannot even smile!\"\nI trust absolutely that when a million sannyasins enter into hell with their guitars and songs and dances and jokes the whole quality and the whole atmosphere of hell is going to be changed -- I think even the devil will join you! He will become a sannyasin: Swami Anand Devil!\nOkay, Maneesha?

What are known as golden rules are only gold-plated. These so- called golden rules are obviously made by people who have gold. You can see that these rules are not golden but only gold-plated...\nWomen have a much better time than men in this world; there are far more things forbidden to them.\nMany a romance begins when a girl sinks into his arms -- and ends up with her arms in his sink.\nBachelor: A man who comes to work each morning from a different direction.\nMilligan's Law of Home Economics: Two can live as cheaply as one, for about half as long.\nYou've heard of the three ages of woman: youth, middle age and, \"You are looking wonderful.\"\nGolding's Law of Typecasting: The world is divided into two types of people, those who divide the world into two types of people, and those who don't.\nThe meek shall inherit the earth, but not its mineral rights.\nWomen are entirely to blame for men's lies; they keep insisting on asking the most awkward questions.\nA thing is not necessarily true because a man dies for it.\nKlein's Law of Possibilities: Nothing is impossible for people who don't have to do it themselves.\nIn this world there are only two tragedies: one is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it.\nMiddle age: Later than you think and sooner than you expect. Old age is not so bad when you consider the alternative.\nPercy's Law of Laziness: The world is divided into two sorts of people, those who are willing to work and those who are willing to let them.\nKarl Marx says, \"To do is to be do.\" Albert Camus says, \"To be is to do.\"\nAnd Frank Sinatra says, \"Do be do be do.\" Question 2\nBELOVED MASTER,\nIS IT POSSIBLE TO EXPERIENCE LOVE AND MEDITATION AT THE SAME\nTIME?\nTaglish Bharti, love and meditation are not two things; hence, the question itself does not arise.\nLove is a meditation and meditation blossoms in love. Of course when I use the word\n`love' I don't mean the love that ordinarily is understood by the word, I don't mean the biological infatuation -- anyway it is not love. It is simply your chemistry, not you which feels attracted, and under the chemistry's illusion you think you are in love. But that kind of love every animal, every bird knows perfectly well.\nOnly man seems to be deluded, and deluded so much that all the animals in the world except man have a certain season when they are infatuated -- their season of reproduction, a very limited period in the year when biology overtakes them, makes them completely blind; forces them almost against their will. Have you seen two animals making love? And have you ever seen them smiling? They look so bored that how to get out of it seems to be the only problem that is troubling them.\nThe whole year they look more relaxed, more at ease, more in tune with nature and with themselves, but when the reproduction season comes they all start looking sad, serious, saintly. They forget their playfulness; they forget their freedom. Suddenly they feel themselves under a kind of hypnotic trance; in fact, it is a chemical trance.\nThat's why scientists are able to change sexes very easily. A man can become a woman, a woman can become a man -- just a very small change, a change in the hormones, in the chemistry of their bodies. Just a few more hormones and the woman will start growing a mustache and beard.\nNow there are many people in the world who have changed their sexes. Sometimes it has happened automatically because man consists of both, man and woman. Something is contributed by your father, something is contributed by your mother, so you are both: your father and your mother, part man, part woman. Whichever is more in percentage, perhaps sixty percent man and forty percent woman, then you are man or it may be otherwise, then you are a woman.\nThis percentage of hormones can be changed just by giving you injections. And in the developed countries there are already men who have been born as women, and women who have changed to men. But in the beginning the very idea came to mind because once in a while there was an accidental case. For example, in\nthe very beginning of this century in London there was a case. A man fell in love with a woman and he married the woman. But after the marriage he was very much amazed that the woman slowly started changing into a man.\nAfter a year he was so much ashamed because the whole town was laughing at him: his woman had turned completely into a man. He went to the court for divorce. The court was puzzled; there had never been a case like that before the court. And the man was perfectly reasonable. He said, \"I married a woman; I have never married a man. Why should I marry a man? Obviously the marriage is canceled; in fact, I don't need any divorce, but just not to be illegal, I am asking for divorce.\"\nHis wife was sent for a medical examination. There was no need because she had a mustache and beard; her breasts had disappeared. There was not much need, but not taking any chances the judge said, \"Let her be medically examined. If the doctor's report says she has become a man then there is no question, your divorce is accepted.\"\nThat gave the idea to the scientists that perhaps the woman has a very small difference between her male hormones and female hormones. Perhaps she is fifty-one percent woman, forty-nine percent man, and by some change, climate, food, some medicine... it can be anything that has altered the proportion between man and woman in her. The difference was very slight, very borderline, and she became a man.\nThis opened a door of great research, and it was found that every man can become a woman and every woman can become a man.\nThis reminds me that in the East, from the very beginning, almost ten-thousand- year-old statues are available in which Shiva and his wife, Parvati, are represented as one personality: half man, half woman. It is a beautiful aesthetic and artistic sculpture, and that's how it has been thought always: a beautiful metaphor, but nobody has thought of it as a reality.\nThe people who created that statue must have come to know that every man is carrying a woman within him and every woman is carrying a man within her -- and this change is not impossible.\nMy own feeling is that in the future many more people will be changing -- because why not have both the experiences in one life? Most intelligent people\nwill change -- the unintelligent always are afraid of any change -- otherwise, you have lived as a woman for thirty years, now it is time, why not have a look from the other side? Why go on living on this bank? The scenery from the other side is also very beautiful.\nOnly then will the old idea of the poets that the woman is a mystery will be solved. You can become a woman and know what the mystery is. You can become a man and know what the mystery is. There is no mystery at all; it is just a poetic conception. The difference is only biological, chemical, hormonal.\nI don't call that kind of infatuation love; I call it lust. And to be confused between lust and love has created your problem.\nYou are asking, \"Is it possible to experience love and meditation at the same time?\" Lust and meditation you cannot experience at the same time.\nLust is against meditation. It is desire, an ugly desire.\nIt takes you towards unconsciousness.\nMeditation is the greatest longing, the only longing which cannot be called a desire. And it takes you upwards towards more consciousness.\nNow both things you cannot do -- going upwards towards more conscious being and going downward towards more unconscious being; you cannot do them both at the same time.\nBut love and meditation are both reaching towards higher states of being. Meditation is a state of thoughtlessness, a state of silence, serenity, tranquility -- a state of blissfulness.\nThere is no reason why love should be against it. Out of blissfulness love will flow. In fact, only a meditative person can be a loving person, and only a loving person can be meditative, because both are going beyond the unconscious mind, the dark mind, the blind mind, and opening the doors of light and the beyond.\nThey are different names and their different names have a certain meaning and significance. Meditation is possible even if you are alone. In fact, it is possible\nonly when you are alone, in your aloneness, utter purity... no crowd of thoughts or emotions or feelings, just a flame of being conscious.\nMeditation is the discovery of your own self.\nBut once you have discovered the treasure a tremendous need arises in you to share it.\nThat sharing is love. Meditation is like the sun and love is like the radiation reaching to faraway flowers to open, for birds to sing, to make the whole living world alive, fresh, rejuvenated. Exactly what the sun is doing to the whole solar system, meditation does to the whole human world: it radiates love.\nAnd if meditation does not radiate love then one is in some fallacy. What he is thinking is meditation is not meditation. It may be concentration, it may be contemplation, but it is not meditation.\nConcentration is of the mind, one pointedness of the mind. Contemplation is also of the mind, not one pointedness but one subject matter. If you are thinking about light you go on thinking about light, higher and deeper and more possibilities and implications of light; but you keep track of one dimension.\nSo we can define contemplation as thinking in one single dimension, not going astray, not going here and there; not allowing many different sorts of thoughts but one singular path, moving in the same direction. Science depends on concentration and philosophy depends on contemplation. Religion depends on meditation.\nMeditation is when mind is not functioning at all, when mind is absolutely silent and still, as if absent. In this absentness of mind your authentic being surfaces. Your mask disappears and your original face is encountered for the first time.\nFor the first time you know who you are.\nAnd this experience of oneself is the experience of one's divineness. Out of this divineness radiates love. It is not addressed to anyone in particular; it simply radiates to friend and to foe, to the familiar and to the stranger; it does not know any discrimination.\nWhen the sun rises it does not rise only for roses and not for marigolds. It does\nnot rise only for rich people and not for the poor. It does not rise only for the strong and not for the weak. It rises unaddressed. It radiates in all directions. Whoever has eyes will be able to see it. Having eyes simply means whoever is receptive, whoever is sensitive will be able to see it. The sun does not rise only for the blind.\nOnly a blind man can pass a man of meditation without feeling his love. I mean spiritually blind, one who does not have any idea of who is within his being; who knows himself according to others, what they say. His knowledge of himself is nothing but a collection of opinions of other people. He does not know himself directly, immediately; and because he does not know himself he remains closed; otherwise it was not possible to crucify Jesus.\nThose who crucified Jesus must have been spiritually blind. The man was absolutely innocent, and he was full of love. He had not harmed anyone; in fact, he was trying to help everyone. But it is a strange world. Here there are more blind people than those who have eyes. And because the people who have eyes and receptivity are in a minority they remain silent. It is very unfortunate that the blind are very articulate and those who have eyes, seeing that the majority are blind, remain silent. They go on seeing that Socrates is being poisoned by the blind and they don't protest.\nIn my eyes the people who poisoned Socrates or crucified Jesus or murdered Mansoor or assassinated Sarmad, they were less responsible than those who knew that what was happening was absolutely wrong but remained silent out of fear.\nThere is a beautiful incident...\nWhen Al-Hillaj Mansoor, a Mohammedan mystic, was being very primitively assassinated... Jesus' crucifixion is far more sophisticated; Socrates' poisoning is even more sophisticated, but nobody has suffered as much as Al-Hillaj Mansoor. First they cut his legs -- they killed him piece by piece, just to torture him as much as possible, to the optimum -- then they cut his hands. Then they destroyed his eyes with hot iron rods --\nthey went on piece by piece.\nThousands of people had gathered to watch. Al-Hillaj Mansoor's master, Junnaid, a famous teacher, was also present. Of course he was absolutely against\nwhat was happening, but the weakness of the good... Seeing the majority he remained silent. He knew that Mansoor was born after thousands of years; he was one of the rarest flowers.\nJunnaid had been a teacher of thousands, but none of his students, none of his disciples had reached to the same heights as Mansoor -- all this he understood.\nPeople were throwing stones before the assassination began. He did not want people to know that he was not throwing stones, so instead of throwing a stone he threw a roseflower, just to show that he had thrown. Now in thousands of stones, who can find out what he had thrown? People saw that he had thrown something.\nBut Mansoor could see. When thousands of stones were falling on him, hitting him, and blood was flowing all over his body, he could see that a roseflower also fell on his face.\nAnd he knew that this roseflower could only be thrown by his master Junnaid. He shouted from his cross, \"Junnaid, these thousands of stones are not hurting me so much as your roseflower; it has created a wound in my very soul.\"\nThis statement is tremendous: \"Thousands of stones have not hurt me. These are people who don't know me -- but you know me; I had grown under your shadow. Still, instead of protesting, you are so cowardly that you are afraid that if you don't throw something people may start suspecting that you may be a friend...\" And tears came to his eyes.\nAnd Mansoor said, \"These tears are not for these stones; these stones are not worth my tears. These tears are for the man who has thrown the roseflower to me.\"\nAnd still Junnaid remained silent.…\nThe good man is responsible. The silent man, the man who has understood is responsible for all that has happened in the history of man against the people who were just pure love, pure silence, pure godliness.\nBut perhaps nothing can be said to those good people either, because if they had come out there would have been another assassination and nothing else. That's what Junnaid said afterwards, and he was right. Other disciples asked him, \"It\nwas very shameful when he called out your name. You behaved as if you were not Junnaid. It is shameful that you did not protest when your greatest disciple was being tortured -- tortured brutally.\"\nNo, even animals don't torture in that way. If you want to kill someone, kill. But to cut him piece by piece is so condemnable.\nThe other disciples said, \"You should have protested.\"\nJunnaid said, \"Do you think it would have saved him? I have also thought about it. It is not that I have not felt the tragedy, I have felt as much hurt as Mansoor. I loved him, but I knew that if I had come out and protested, then instead of one man, two men would have been assassinated. Nothing would have been achieved by it.\"\nBut still I feel it would have been better that two men were assassinated instead of one. I differ from Junnaid, because there may have been a third man who would have come out, and three men may have provoked courage in many more. It is not that in that vast crowd there was only Junnaid who saw that it was absolutely inhuman and ugly -- and there was no crime. The crime was simply that Al-Hillaj Mansoor had said, \"I am God,\" ana'l haq, and simultaneously he said, \"It is not that only I am God -- you are also. I know it; you still have to know it. That's the only difference.\"\nSo he was not speaking because of his ego, he was speaking because of his experience.\nHe was not denying godhood to anyone. He was simply saying, \"Your God seems to be asleep; my God is awake. One day it was also asleep and I was as ignorant as you are.\nOne day you will be also as awake as I am. It is only a difference of time.\"\nSuch a compassionate man. Why has humanity behaved so badly with these people? One of the reasons, fundamental reasons is that their height hurts people's egos. Their silence, their love, their beauty, their grace, their blissfulness... Everything hurts people, because they are living in dark holes, in misery, in suffering, in anguish, and somebody is standing on the hilltop, sunlit, surrounded by fragrant flowers. They cannot forgive such a man.\nThis is something to be deeply understood and remembered, that up till now man has proved by and large barbarous. All talk of civilization is nonsense. All talk of culture, Hindu, Mohammedan, Christian, is simply bullshit. Because the way we have behaved with our best sons and daughters is not cultured, is not human. It is subhuman or perhaps even below animals.\nNo animal murders another animal of his own species. No lion will kill another lion, howsoever hungry; he would rather die than kill. But man is the only animal again. He is unique in many ways: he is the only one who kills people of his own species -- not only kills but eats.\nJust a few days ago in Palestine the people demanded from the government, \"We should be allowed to eat the dead people because there is a shortage of food -- and it seems utterly uneconomical not to eat the dead people.\" Their demand was ugly but more ugly is that the Palestinian government has accepted their demand, saying that it is okay. The government cannot supply food. On what grounds can it deny them?\nFirst they will start eating people who died naturally and then they will start eating people who have been killed on purpose. That has happened in Buddhist countries: in China, in Japan, in Korea, in Taiwan. You will find hotels where it is written, \"Here only the meat of the naturally dead animals is available.\" Now so many natural deaths of animals don't happen anywhere in the world that they can supply food for the whole country. How many animals do you see dying naturally?\nThose boards are absolutely false, as false as you will find in India. Every restaurant, hotel, sweetshop... they will all have a board saying, \"Only pure ghee is used here.\" And everywhere vegetable ghee made by vegetables, not by milk, and sometimes even by rotten vegetables, not even the best quality vegetables, is available. From where can they get so much pure ghee? You cannot even get pure milk.\nI was a postgraduate student and the man who used to supply the milk to all the students in the hostel was known as a very saintly man; he was really called Santa Baba, because everybody thought, He is so honest; he is supplying pure milk. He always used to come with his son, carrying the milk.\nI heard him many times. If somebody asked \"Santa Baba, is the milk really\npure?\" He would immediately put his hand on his son's head and say, \"If I have mixed water in the milk my son will die.\"\nNaturally people thought... I heard it many times. I started thinking that there must be some clue to the mystery, because I used to take his milk and I knew it was not pure. It was so thin that it was more water than milk. One day I took him aside and I said to him,\n\"No need of your son... and no need for you to put your hand on his head. You just tell me one thing. Is it really true?\"\nFor a moment he was silent and then he said, \"It is not true.\" I said, \"You are every day offering your son.\"\nHe said, \"It is very simple. I never mix water into milk; I always mix milk into water. So I am not making any wrong statement.\"\nYou cannot get anything pure.\nI have heard about Mulla Nasruddin, that he wanted to commit suicide. So he went and got poison with great difficulty from a chemist. He had to bribe him because from where would he get the prescription for poison? Without the prescription the chemist said, \"I cannot give you anything; you have to have a doctor's prescription.\"\nHe said, \"Who is going to give me the prescription? I want to commit suicide. You take these one hundred rupees or two hundred rupees, because I am going to die. What am I going to do with the rupees afterwards?\"\nSo he bribed him, went very happily home, mixed the poison in the milk, drank it, slept, waited and waited and waited, and there was no death coming, not even sleep! Many times he woke up, looked all around -- whether he was in hell or heaven... but his wife was snoring by his side.\nHe said, \"My God, how long is this poison going to take? The chemist was saying the moment you put it on your tongue you are gone...\"\nAnd it was becoming morning. The whole night he had been waiting. Morning came and his wife was still snoring by his side. He rushed to the chemist -- he\nwas just opening the doors of his shop -- and asked him, \"What is the matter?\"\nHe said, \"What can I do? You know, in this country you cannot find anything pure.\nEverything is mixed. In a way it is good; nobody can commit suicide -- at least by taking poison.\"\nA man of love is really the only man who is cultured, who is civilized. And such a love arises only as a fragrance of meditation; hence my insistence on meditation. Unless we turn people towards meditation on a vaster scale -- as it has never been done before --\nthere is not much hope for the future, for future humanity.\nBut I am not a pessimist, not a single inch. I am an absolute optimist. I will believe to the very last moment when the world is committing suicide in a world war, to the last moment I will trust that man will wake up. Seeing such a tremendous tragedy ahead, how can people remain asleep?\nNow there are only two alternatives: either suicide or meditation. Life has brought us to such a point where there are not many roads; just two roads, two possibilities, simple choice. Either humanity chooses to commit suicide under the leadership of Ronald Reagan, or humanity chooses to meditate, to be silent, to be peaceful, to be human, to be loving.\nOnly through meditation can we defeat the politicians -- and the politicians need to be totally defeated. Their power has to be destroyed forever. Their nuclear weapons and their atomic weapons have to be thrown in the Atlantic and in the Pacific. And if they want to jump with them they can jump also, because they are the greatest criminals in the world.\nOrdinary criminals may murder somebody and you take them to the gallows. Adolf Hitler kills eight million people, alone. Joseph Stalin kills one million Russians, his own people, without any difficulty. All these politicians continue creating more and more weapons to destroy humanity. And they are the leaders, they are the guides of people.\nWith these blind politicians dominating the world there is no hope.\nI invite the whole humanity, because this is a decisive moment, this is the time when a great revolution is needed, a revolution against all politicians, without any discrimination of whether they are socialist, communist, fascist, capitalist; whether they believe in democracy or they believe in dictatorship -- it does not matter.\nFor the first time all politicians are standing together to destroy humanity, and if we can make man free from the political jargon... The only way to free man is to make man loving, peaceful. So he simply drops the weapons and he says, \"They are not needed. We are not going to kill each other. And if you have so much urge to fight, then the presidents and the prime ministers can have boxing matches -- and we all will enjoy. It will be really great.\"\nWhat is the need to destroy so many innocent people for a few idiots who cannot come to a solution; seeing perfectly well that the time is becoming shorter and shorter and any accident is possible -- and there will be no humanity at all.\nI have heard that the third world war happened, and a monkey sitting on a tree says to a female monkey, \"Darling, should we start it all again?\" And he has an apple in his hand.\n\"Eat it again\"... and God will throw you out of the Garden of Eden and the beginning of another humanity.…\nBut that humanity will again end up in some Ronald Reagan -- it won't be different. The only difference that can be called a difference is the difference of consciousness. And meditation is nothing but a science of creating that difference.\nYou are asking, \"Is it possible to experience love and meditation at the same time?\"\nAnd I am saying to you: Love is only possible if meditation is possible. They are both two wings of the same bird. And if you want the bird to fly high in the sky of consciousness, both the wings are needed, love and meditation, but not your kind of love.\nYou should remember the difference between your kind of love and the love I'm talking about.\nThe husband and wife were having a terrible argument. Finally the wife threw up her arms and exclaimed, \"Why did I have to marry you to find out how stupid you are?\"\n\"You did not have to,\" replied the husband angrily. \"You should have known it the minute I asked you.\"\nWho is going to ask you except a stupid person! That very moment it was clear, there was no need for so many years to wait to find out. I am not talking about this love.\nThe new fully-automatic airplane was making its first cross-country flight. A recorded announcement said, \"This is the first all-automatic jet. There is no pilot, no crew. Press a button and we take off. Press another button and dinner is served. Press another button and we land. Nothing can go wrong... can go wrong... can go wrong... can go wrong \"\nAnd we are sitting on a volcano of nuclear weapons -- and everything can go wrong! Just press a button...\nYour question is not only a personal question. It has now become a question for the whole of humanity, the whole earth. But unfortunately, in five billion people it is difficult to find even a few hundred people who are sincerely interested in finding what meditation is -- not by studying about it but by experiencing it.\nTime is running short. Every moment we are coming closer to a situation which may be deliberately created or may be just accidental. We have known the experience a few days ago. In France something went wrong; in Russia something went wrong. You cannot trust machines. Man has not trusted man but he has trusted machines more.\nYou will be surprised to know that in Japan, which is the most technologically advanced country in the world today -- it has left America far behind Its\ncurrency is now the most valuable; the dollar rates second. In America the greatest rich man has only four and a half billion dollars. In Japan the richest man has twenty-one billion dollars. And Japan is the only country where thousands of robots, mechanical men, are functioning and working in the factories. They are cheap, because they don't get temperamental, they don't go on strike, they don't ask for wages. The question of a pay rise does not arise.\nThey work twenty-four hours a day with no shift change.\nBut suddenly, last month a strange thing happened -- that's what I call an accident. In one factory five persons were killed by the robot mechanical men; something went berserk.\nThose robots simply grabbed the people who were passing by, gave them a good hug --\nfinished. Engineers could not believe what was happening, \"Is it some kind of love that has arisen in the heart of the robot?\"\nAnd not only one, five robots in one factory -- just in one day. And from that day people are keeping far away. Even engineers are looking from far away because to come close if the robot falls in love with you... Then just a good hug, and you are finished. I am not talking about this kind of love.\nMan also does this kind of love, not only robots. If you watch men... How many men have killed how many women although they are alive? How many men have been killed by women although they are alive, but just alive, breathing, surviving? But they don't know any life. Love has destroyed their life. This is not the love I am talking about.\nLove should enhance life, make it richer and more beautiful and more blissful. Lovers should give more freedom to each other, more individuality, more dignity. But what is happening for centuries is just the opposite. Lovers are trying to dominate each other, to destroy each other, to enslave each other. I am not talking about that love. That love cannot go with meditation.\n\"My wife thinks she is a chicken,\" the husband explained to the psychiatrist. \"That's a serious delusion,\" was the reply. \"How long has this been going on?\" \"Three years,\" mumbled the husband.\n\"Three years?\" said the shocked shrink. \"Why did you not bring her in before now?\"\n\"Well,\" replied the embarrassed husband, \"frankly, we needed the eggs.\"\nThis is going on with almost every couple; they are driving each other crazy. This is not love. If this is love then what is hate?\nThe very idea of domination, the very desire to be powerful over others shows a poverty of soul. It shows that you don't have power over yourself; hence the desire to have power over others.\nThat's why I say the politician is the poorest person in the world, because his desire is to have power over millions of people. This desire shows his poverty. He has no power over himself and he wants to have power. But it does not matter... he may have power over one person or one million people or one billion people -- it does not matter. His inner feeling of inferiority, that he has no power within himself will remain the same. He can deceive the world but he cannot deceive himself.\nThat's the difference between the politician and the religious person. The religious person searches for power over himself, and the politician searches for power over others. The politician is bound to be violent, destructive, ugly, barbarous.\nOnly a man who wants to be the power over himself, who wants to know where the source of his life is, from where he is getting his energy, where the life and energy source within him are...\nThe search for it is meditation. Finding it is enlightenment.\nAnd once you have found it you have so much, in such abundance, that you cannot help sharing it. You become a rain cloud which wants to shower on the thirsty earth. And you must have smelled the sweet fragrance that comes from the thirsty earth, from the first rain cloud's shower on it, in gratitude, in thankfulness.\nA man of meditation like Gautam Buddha showers his love -- he is a rain cloud, or better to call him a love cloud, who showers his love to all those who are thirsty, to all those who are aware that love is showering.\nBut the majority are so foolish, they immediately open their umbrellas. They protect themselves from love, they protect themselves from Gautam Buddhas,\nthey protect themselves from Socrates... Strange people. Something is basically wrong, and that is, they don't know themselves and they don't know their thirst and they don't know what nourishment they need.\nLove is the nourishment that is missing in the world.\nYussel Moscowitz had lost all interest in life, so he went to see his psychiatrist. The usually patient shrink decided to use shock tactics this time and said sharply, \"What would happen if I cut off your left ear?\"\n\"I could not hear,\" replied Yussel with a sigh.\n\"Then what would happen if I cut off your right ear?\" barked the shrink. \"I could not see,\" said Yussel, beginning to show signs of boredom.\nThe psychiatrist became alarmed. \"This is serious. Why do you say you could not see if I cut off your right ear?\"\n\"Because,\" said Yussel with a yawn, \"my hat would fall over my eyes. Both the ears gone, how can I see?\"\nThe people you think are psychiatrists, psychologists, psychoanalysts, the people who are helping humanity to become more sane, are the most insane people in the world. The statistics are very clear. From no other profession do so many people go mad as from the profession of psychiatry. The proportion is double that from any other profession.\nIn the past the professors used to be champions of going mad; now they are number two.\nNumber one is the psychologists. They commit suicide four times more than any other profession -- and these are the people who are helping humanity to be sane, normal, healthy, intelligent. These are the people supposed to teach you how to live and how to live joyously. These are the people who claim that their function is to teach the art of living.\nBut if these people are going to teach the art of living it is going to be a really dangerous art of living. It will not be the art of living, it will be the art of at the most vegetating.\nThe professor asked the young girl in his psychology class, \"Which part of the body expands to ten times its natural size under an emotional impact?\"\nBlushing, the girl replied, \"I would rather not answer that.\"\nThe professor called on the boy sitting next to her who promptly replied, \"The pupil of the eye.\"\nThe professor turned back to the girl and said, \"Your confusion shows three things. One, that you did not do your homework; two, that you have a dirty mind; and three, that one day you will be sadly disappointed.\"\nOkay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.\nThe Invitation Chapter #29\nChapter title: The crescendo of the insanity of centuries 5 September 1987 am in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium\nArchive code: 8709050\nShortTitle: INVITA29\nAudio: Yes Video: Yes\nLength:\n103\nmins Question 1\nBELOVED OSHO,\nSINCE BECOMING OLD TWO DAYS AGO, I HAVE DISCOVERED A WHOLE\nNEW WORLD, THE WORLD OF WOMEN'S GOSSIP. I AM NOW ACCEPTED AS\nONE OF THE GIRLS -- WELL ALMOST, BUT I GUESS I WILL NEVER KNOW\nTHAT. MY QUESTION IS: IS THERE NO END TO GRATITUDE?\nDevageet, I have told you that the woman has three ages. She never becomes old; it is only the man who becomes old.\nThe woman passes through childhood, through youth and, \"How wonderful you are looking.\"\nI think somebody has told you, \"How wonderful you are looking.\" That has given you the wrong conception of \"Since becoming old two days ago...\"\nAll are lunatics, but he who can analyze his delusion is called a philosopher. From today you will be known as a philosopher.…\nRemember: Old age is when the candles cost more than the cake. And also remember: Old age is when getting it up gets you down.\nYou have certainly entered into the age when people will call to you, \"How wonderful you are looking.\"\nThe eyes of the dead are closed gently; we also have to open gently the eyes of the living.\nI will try my best to be gentle with you because you must be dreaming: women never become old; it has never been heard of.\nYou are not aware of a very fundamental law: When you are up to your nose, keep your mouth shut.\nAnd never forget that money can't buy happiness, but it can buy you the kind of misery you prefer.\nIn old age certainly one wants to be happy, but nothing can buy happiness. In old age people have money, but money can buy only the misery you prefer, not happiness.\nSo I think, Devageet, it is better still to wait. Two days is not a long time, you can come back. It is dangerous to be old. Start falling in love with someone, and old age will disappear. That is one of the strategies to drop old age.…\nA man in love is incomplete -- that's true -- until he has married. Then he is finished.\nSo just don't get married. Always remain in love, and you will be young. The moment you are married then I cannot help.\nThe only thing to remember about women is: A man who moralizes is really a hypocrite, and a woman who moralizes is invariably ugly.\nJust avoid the moralizing women!\nIt is simply human to err -- and that's what you have done, fallen into a human error -- but the law is: To err is human, but to make a real mess of things you need a computer.\nOne who dares to be a fool should remember that that is the first step in the direction of wisdom.\nYou have the intrinsic capacity to become wise, but only two-day-old, not very old.\nIf you have really become old, you will come to know sex is hereditary. If your parents never had it, chances are you won't either.\nSocialism is when the state owns everything; capitalism is when your wife does.\nAnd this is a tremendously significant maxim to remember as far as old people are concerned: Whenever you feel the urge to exercise, just lie down and wait until it passes.\nIf you have really become old just have a look at your passport. If you actually look like your passport photo, you are not well enough to travel.\nDevageet, you are perfectly young. Just to avoid women you are trying to play that you are old. That is not new. In my commune every sannyasin plays old. This is a very different world: outside men are chasing women; in my commune women chase men.\nOutside women have headaches; in the commune men have headaches. They look so much worried and afraid that some woman is going to get them -- and most often the woman succeeds.\nIt is good that you understand that two days ago you became old. Remain old!\nA big Yorkshire farmer found it necessary to go to London for several months and decided to leave one of his best workers in charge: \"I want you to take care of things, Harry, as if I were here myself, understand?\"\nHarry nodded.\nFour months later the boss farmer returned to find everything in shape. Harry, pointing things out said, \"The chicks have been laying plenty of eggs, the wheat has grown double strong, the vegetables are better than they have ever been, and as for those monthly spells your daughter used to have, I have even got those stopped.\"\nDevageet's old age is the same. Let him remain old but don't believe his old age. He can get anybody's monthly problem stopped. He is simply pretending to be old.\nQuestion 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nAM I MOVING RIGHTLY OR AM I JUST A HOPELESS NUTCASE?\nPremnath, your question is very significant, because in this world everybody is moving rightly except the nuts -- at least that's what the whole humanity believes.\nThe reality is just the contrary: the whole of humanity is a nutcase, and only a few nuts escape from this madhouse you call the world.\nIt happened once...\nKahlil Gibran's one friend became mad. He was a very great poet, thinker of a high caliber, a genius. When Kahlil Gibran heard he came back to Lebanon. He was born in Lebanon, he was brought up in Lebanon, he was a Lebanese. But then he went to America and he spent his whole life in America.\nHearing about his friend in Lebanon he came back to see him; he went to the madhouse.\nHis friend was sitting alone in the park of the madhouse on a bench. He looked at Kahlil Gibran but did not pay much attention, did not even show that he has recognized him.\nKahlil Gibran said, \"Don't you recognize me?\"\nHe said, \"I recognize everybody. But what are you doing here? With great difficulty I have been able to leave that mad world and enter into this peaceful place. What are you doing here?\"\nAnd Kahlil Gibran writes in his diary, \"It shocked me, but he was making a very significant point. He was saying that only the madhouse seems to be sane, and outside the madhouse everybody is insane.\"\nAt least in the madhouse nobody worries, nobody is ambitious to become a president or a prime minister, nobody is concerned to become the richest man, nobody has any ambition. People are enjoying moment-to-moment life. You may not like their way of doing it, you may not like their way of enjoying it, but that is your problem not their problem. In the madhouse nobody has any problem\nexcept the doctors who are running here and there worried and concerned. The mad people don't have any worry in the world; they are just at ease as they are. They are in a tremendous acceptability.\nIt happened in one madhouse...\nThe old doctor retired and a new doctor came. So there was a farewell party and a welcome party also for the new doctor. The old doctor who was retiring spoke first.\nThere was not a single clap. Nobody laughed, nobody seemed even to hear him or what he was talking about. There was utter silence as if there was nobody present. And when the new doctor stood up people clapped, enjoyed, a few people started dancing...\nThe new doctor said, \"This is strange. The old doctor who has served them his whole life is retiring, and they remain completely silent; they did not even clap once.\"\nSo when the meeting was over he asked a madman, \"What is the matter? Why did you misbehave with the old man? You clapped for me and you don't know me at all.\"\nThey all said, \"The reality is, you look just like one of us. We were so happy to find you.\nThat man was a problem. He was continuously worried -- and here nobody is worried; things are running very smoothly.\"\nNo war, no murder, no suicide -- and it is one of the strangest things that mad people rarely fall sick. If they are sick they become healthy. Mad people are healthy people, because all the problems that can create mental tension and can affect your body are no longer there. Their bodies are natural, and they become innocent like children.\nThe new doctor was very much shocked when he heard the real reason for their clapping and joyous shouts and why a few started dancing. When he heard that they thought that he was one of them, he looked a little crazy.\nIn fact, one of the great psychologists, Adler, has created a psychology around\nwill to power. And one day he was in his class. He said to his disciples who he was preparing for the new psychology, \"The people who become teachers are the people who want to dominate others, and that is the easiest way to dominate; small children cannot do anything much about it. The people who become politicians suffer from inferiority complex. To hide that they try to magnify their ego as much as they can -- until it bursts.\"\nAnd he was explaining about every kind of profession -- why people choose a certain profession. One young man stood up and he said, \"You have left one profession out completely, the profession of the psychologist.\"\nAdler was silent. He could not answer because the answer was clear. The student said,\n\"Perhaps you cannot say it, but I will have to say to complete the list. The people who tend to become psychologists are people who are psychologically sick.\"\nIn fact, neurotics, psychotics, all kinds of nuts, enter into the world of psychology. That is the most beautiful hiding place they can find. They become experts about madness, but deep down they are mad people. I have studied the lives of psychologists and I have been really surprised that these people should have been in madhouses. They are treating mad people, and they are the most highly paid profession in the world.\nYou are asking, \"Am I moving rightly or am I just a hopeless nutcase?\" Everybody is a nutcase but nobody is hopeless. The world has unfortunately been growing for thousands of years in such a way that it has turned everybody into a nutcase. There are two kinds of nuts: normal and abnormal.\nThe normal nuts run the whole world. They are doctors, they are professors, they are engineers; deep down the madness is there, but within limits. Everybody is on the boundary line. Just a small incident, a small accident, and they can go beyond the boundary line: the wife dies, the business goes bankrupt -- anything can happen and the boundary line can be crossed, they immediately become nutcases.\nThe psychologists of the whole world are only trying to do one thing: to make abnormal nuts normal, somehow to bring them back within the boundary line. It does not help the nutcases, but it helps the world to go on running in its common way.\nBut why has it happened that so many people in the world are either mad or just on the boundary line? There is not any qualitative difference, but only a quantitative difference, a difference of degrees. We have been brought up with mother's milk, with all kinds of superstitions; they have gone deep into our unconscious.\nI used to live in a city for a few months. Just in front of me there was a municipal water tap. And the man had the idea that while he was filling his pot with the water, if a woman passed by, that water had become dirty. He would immediately throw the water and he would start filling it again.\nOne day I was watching. \"What is the matter?\" I asked the man. He said, \"According to my religion women are -- even their shadow is dirty, and I cannot drink dirty water.\"\nI managed to find a woman and paid her so that I could tell her, \"Tomorrow you go on walking and let us see how long his religion lasts.\"\nBut that man was also a man of great courage, because the whole day... The woman got tired, but I was paying her so she managed to continue. She went away for some time to eat; she sent her daughter to replace... The evening came but the man continued to throw away the water because the woman had come.\nFinally it was too much. He threw the pot and came directly to me, because he understood what was happening. And he said, \"You will drive me crazy!\"\nI said, \"You are crazy. Nobody can drive you crazy. The very idea you are carrying that even the shadow of the woman makes things dirty... You are born of a woman, so you are dirty. For nine months you have been within the womb of a woman, and you have not even thought for a single moment what kind of a stupid idea you are carrying. Nobody can drive you crazy. I am trying to drive you sane. So remember, from tomorrow this superstition is not going to happen again; otherwise... I get paid enough, and I am alone --\nI will keep a woman constantly on duty so that whenever you are on the tap she has just to walk there. Or she can just stand there, why walk?\"\nThe man said, \"Then something will have to be done.\"\nAnd he did; he changed neighborhood. That very night he escaped from the\nneighborhood. I tried to find where he had gone. I was in search, but the city was big.\nSomebody who knew him told me, \"Don't waste your time. He has left the city itself because he knows you will not leave him easily; wherever he goes, you can appoint a woman to walk... And without the water he cannot cook his food, he cannot eat his food, he cannot drink water. You were killing him.\"\nBut he was not thought mad, because in the neighborhood in which he was living everybody had that superstition. He was just poor; others had their own running water.\nThat poor man did not have his own bathroom, his own running water, so he was using the corporation water. But they all believed that he was right, I was wrong.\nThat's why I should disturb people's religions -- these are religions. If you just watch what kind of religions people have been brought up in, you will be surprised that they have turned the whole humanity into an insanity.\nI had once a friend who was a professor, and I have been his student also. For my postgraduate studies I was his student, and then when I also became a professor in the same university we became colleagues. But our friendship was old, since my student days. He had the idea that to see a woman is the greatest sin. Now he was a well-qualified professor.… He used to walk with his umbrella covering his eyes, so that he could see only two or three feet ahead. And he used to run so fast -- his bungalow and the department were not very far apart. With his umbrella touching his head he would run almost to his house and lock his house from inside.\nIn the class I was the only male; there were two female students. There were only three persons in his class. He could not look at women; it was against his religion which believed that celibacy is the foundation of religion.\nSo he used to teach with closed eyes. Seeing him teach with closed eyes, I thought this was a good opportunity to have a good sleep. So I was also sitting with closed eyes.\nThose two girls wondered... and they felt strange also: the teacher is asleep -- with closed eyes he is speaking; the only male student is listening with closed eyes.…\nThe professor thought that I must be following the same ideology of celibacy. He was very happy, because in the university he was laughed at. Now at least there were two persons belonging to the same idea. He took me aside one day and he said, \"You are doing it perfectly well. But how do you manage on the road? -- because I don't see you carrying the umbrella.\"\nI said, \"To tell you the truth I don't belong to your madness. I'm simply sleeping; this is my time to sleep. My whole life I have slept from twelve to two without any exception.\"\nEven in school I used to disappear for those two hours. In the university I used to disappear, and when I became a professor I asked the vice-chancellor, \"These two hours are absolutely sacred to me. You can give me periods before or after, but these two hours you cannot touch.\"\nHe said, \"What is the matter?\"\nI said, \"The matter is that these two hours are devoted to sleep. If you give me a period I will sleep -- and I will tell all the students to fall asleep, to just keep quiet and silent and enjoy.\"\nSo he gave me periods after two o'clock.\nI told the professor -- Bhattacharya was his name -- \"You are under a wrong impression. I don't believe in such idiotic ideas, because with your closed eyes you are seeing the woman more. What are you seeing with your eyes closed? And in fact, why have you closed the eyes? You must have seen the woman first, then only can you close your eyes.\nAnd if in seeing a woman your celibacy is disturbed, it is not much of a celibacy. What will you do in a dream?\"\nHe said, \"You are right. In a dream I cannot do anything. Neither is the umbrella there...\nand the eyes are already closed -- the women are inside. Do you have any suggestion?\"\nI said, \"Because of this umbrella and because of these closed eyes your dreams are disturbed by women. If you drop this idiotic discipline that you have\nimposed upon yourself... Women have their own business. Who is bothering to come into your dreams?\"\nHe said, \"No, my father followed the same ideology, my forefathers...\" -- he was a brahmin from Bengal -- \"and I cannot drop it, although I know the whole university thinks me mad.\"\nBut others have their own madness. It may be different, may not be detectable if everybody has it, but to be sane there is only one possibility and that comes out of meditation; otherwise, whatever you do is going to be insane because it will be coming out of your unconsciousness. You will not be doing it in your alertness, in your awareness.\nAccording to me the madman is one who has fallen completely unconscious, who has lost even the thin layer of consciousness that you have. But even the thin layer of consciousness does not prevent you from behaving insanely.\nYou just watch yourself. Just watch your thoughts -- and you will be amazed what kind of thoughts go on in your mind. Watch your actions, what kind of actions you go on doing. Are they actions or are they only reactions?\nA sane man behaves differently. A Gautam Buddha is surrounded by a crowd which is abusing him, using ugly words, obscene words, because he is against the organized religion of the Hindus and he is against the Hindu holy scriptures, the VEDAS. He has criticized them as hard as it is possible, and they need it. It is not that he is wrong. He has condemned the whole priesthood, that these are the exploiters, parasites. Naturally, brahmins were enraged.\nAnd this was a brahmin village through which he was passing. And the brahmins surrounded him and said every kind of bad thing that they could manage. He listened silently. His disciples became angry, but because Buddha was present it was not courteous to say anything before the master. The master was standing so silent, and listening as if they are saying very sweet things.\nFinally Buddha said to them, \"If your things that you wanted to say to me are finished, I would like to reach to the place where people must be waiting for me. But if your things are not finished, after a few days when I will be returning I will inform you. And I will have enough time to listen to all that you want to say.\"\nOne man said, \"Do you think we are saying something? We are condemning you. Do you understand or not? Because anybody else would become angry, and you are standing silently...\"\nThe statement that Buddha made to these village people is immensely significant. He said, \"You have come a little too late. If you had come ten years ago when I was as insane as you are, not a single person would have gone alive.\"\nTen years ago he was a prince, a warrior, one of the best archers of his time, a great swordsman, and those brahmins... he could simply have removed their heads with a single blow, without any difficulty. Because those brahmins know nothing about swords or arrows or being a warrior. He would have just cut them\n-- almost like vegetables.\nHe said, \"You have come late. Ten years ago if you had come... but now I am no longer insane. I cannot react and I would like to ask you one question. In the last village people came with sweets and fruits and flowers to receive me, but we take food only one time a day, and we had already taken the food. And we don't carry things, so we had to tell them, `You please forgive us, we cannot accept sweets, flowers. We accept your love, but these things you will have to take away.' I want to ask you,\" he said to this angry crowd,\n\"what must they have done with their sweets and flowers that they had brought as presents to us.\"\nOne man said, \"What is the problem in it? They must have distributed the sweets in the village.\"\nBuddha said, \"That makes me very sad. What will you do? -- because I don't accept what you have brought, just the same way as I did not accept the sweets and the flowers and other things that the people brought to me in the other village, if I don't accept your obscenity, your ugly words, your dirty words, if I don't accept, what can you do? What are you going to do with all this garbage that you have come with? You will have to take it back to your homes and give it to your wives, to your children, to your neighbors.\n\"You will have to distribute it, because I simply refuse to take it. And you cannot make me angry unless I accept your humiliation, your insult. Ten years ago I was not conscious; if somebody had insulted me he would have lost his life immediately. I had no idea that insulting me is his problem, and that I have\nnothing to do with it -- I can simply listen and go on my way.\"\nThis is what I call sanity. Do you think humanity is sane? It only appears... just superficial sanity, mannerism, etiquette, culture, civilization, just skin-deep. Scratch a little deeper and the barbarous comes out.\nIf you really want, Premnath, to be a sane being, sannyas is the way for sanity, for dropping all those unconscious layers of your mind which force you to behave unconsciously. And in your unconsciousness you are doing things for which you yourself will repent when you will become a little alert and aware, \"What have I done?\"\nThe insane person can only react. The sane person acts, the sane person responds\n-- he never reacts.\nThe way is simple and you are at the right place where your mind can become calm and quiet, so much so, as if it is absent. You should be certain of your sanity only if you can attain a state of no-mind. Only then can you be certain that nothing can drive you mad, because the mind that was possible to become insane is no more -- you have transcended it.\nI am reminded of an old story...\nOnce there was an old couple who lived deep in the forest, and they never saw anybody else. One day the old husband was walking on a lonely path when he saw something shining on the ground. He bent down to pick it up and it was a mirror. But he had never seen a mirror before and when he saw his own face reflected in it, he thought it was his father's face. Obviously he had never seen his own face, but he had seen his father's face.\nSo he took it home and placed it up in the attic for safekeeping, and every evening he would go up and say good night to his father. But his wife became suspicious about what he was doing in the attic every evening. So one night she followed him. She saw him looking at the mirror and saying good night to it... but she had never seen a mirror before either! So she pushed over to him, grabbed the mirror out of his hand, looked into it and said, \"You old idiot! You mean every night you come sneaking up here just to say good night to this ugly old woman?\"\nBut this is how our mind functions. You don't know your original face -- and\nthere is no mirror which can show you your original face. What you know as your face is only the face that you have seen reflected in the mirror; it is a reflection.\nYou must have seen in big cities or in exhibitions or in circuses, there are mirror halls where different kinds of mirrors are arranged: in some mirrors you become so tall, and in some mirrors you become such a pygmy; in some mirrors you become so fat, and in some mirrors you become so thin.…\nI don't think the mirror that you are using can be perfect. It is very difficult to have a perfect mirror. If by chance you have a mirror which makes your face look beautiful or ugly, then you will carry that idea with yourself.\nBut you don't know your original face, how it is, directly. It is only in the state of no-mind that you become aware of your originality, and that is the only sanity as far as I am concerned -- as far as any awakened human being has ever been concerned.\nIt is by going beyond the mind and entering into the no-mind that you will attain sanity; otherwise, Premnath, you will remain either a normal nutcase -- or if you are a little courageous, a little adventurous, you may go beyond the border, and you will be stamped a madman. And once you are stamped by the society as a madman you may come back to being normal, but nobody will ever think that you are normal.\nI used to live with one of my father's sisters while I was in the college studying. The husband of my father's sister had a brother. He used to come just to chitchat with me, and I saw every possibility that he could go beyond the border; just a little push was needed.\nSo one day I was talking to him and I told him, \"If you are really religious\" -- and he was a very religious fanatic -- \"then you should touch your wife's feet every night before you go to bed.\"\nHe said, \"But where is it written?\"\nI said, \"It is not written. Great principles remain unwritten, they are transferred from master to disciple.\"\nBut he said, \"People will think that I am mad or something. Nobody touches the\nfeet of his wife.\"\nI said, \"Every woman should be taken as your mother; only then you can be celibate.\"\nHe said, \"That's right.\"\nThat night he went home. He touched the feet of his wife and the wife shrieked and the whole house gathered saying: \"What are you doing?\"\nAnd he said, \"Every woman is a mother.\"\nThey said, \"That's right but that does not mean that you have to touch the feet of your wife. Don't be stupid!\"\nBut he became stubborn -- he was a fanatic. He said, \"I will touch... She is my wife, not yours -- and what is wrong in it? I am just paying my respect.\"\nHis other brothers came to me asking, \"What kind of thing have you told him?\"\nI said, \"I was just checking whether he could cross the line or not. I will pull him back.\nDon't be worried.\"\nBut it was really difficult to pull him back. I had to convince him, \"Just for society's sake... You have deep respect, you can touch your wife's feet when she is asleep in the night. Show your respect; it does not matter whether she is asleep or awake.\"\nHe said, \"That's right. I am getting into trouble; everybody thinks I am mad.\"\nHe stopped touching the feet but everybody continued to think that he was a little cuckoo.\nPeople had never thought that he was cuckoo before when he was doing the same things.\nNow he is doing the same things and people are suspicious. Once a suspicion has entered, then it is very difficult to remove it from the mind of the society.\nAnd in fact people enjoy it that you are mad and they are not mad. They provoke your madness once they know that you are vulnerable. Only one person is not vulnerable to any provocation: he who knows the secret of meditation.\nA couple went to see a new movie, and the two seats in front of them were occupied by a man and his dog. When the film was over the dog applauded enthusiastically. The man behind leaned forward and said, \"That's simply astonishing.\"\n\"Yes, it is,\" said the dog's companion, \"Especially since he hated the book.\" Just all around you, if you watch clearly, you will find all kinds of nuts.…\nThe Queen of England was visiting The Royal Military Hospital, and insisted on making a round of the wards. She came into a room with three beds and asked the first soldier,\n\"What is wrong with you?\"\nEmbarrassed, the soldier replied, \"Syphilis, Your Majesty.\"\nTrying to appear natural, the Queen asked, \"And what treatment do you get for it?\"\n\"Wire brush and Dettol,\" the soldier replied.\n\"Is there anything you would like to make your stay more comfortable?\" the Queen asked.\n\"No, Ma'am, I'm a soldier in the Queen's Own Regiment, and that's enough for me.\"\nDeeply touched, the Queen moved on to the next bed, where the soldier lay on his stomach. \"What is wrong with you, soldier?\" she asked.\n\"Piles, Your Majesty,\" grunted the soldier. \"What is your treatment here?\"\n\"Wire brush and Dettol, Ma'am.\"\nWincing the Queen asked if there was anything she could do to make him more comfortable. He answered that he was simply grateful to be a soldier in the Queen's Own Regiment, and that was more than enough.\nThe third soldier told her hoarsely that his problem was a sore throat. \"What is the treatment for that?\" she asked.\n\"Wire brush and Dettol, Ma'am,\" came the reply.\n\"Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable?\" \"Yes, Ma'am. Next time I would like my treatment first.\"\nIt is such an insane world you have just to be watchful and alert and you will see ridiculous, hilarious things happening everywhere. It is unbelievable that sane people should do such things.\nBut remember: everybody is vulnerable. We are born in a wrong society, in a wrong world, with wrong conditions. And unless you are really interested to get rid of your past and past impacts, impressions on your mind, it is not going to leave you easily. The madness continues.\nAnd as you grow your madness also continues to grow. It is not strange that after sixty, people start thinking you are senile; you have been always. Just now the senility has grown to a point where it is apparent. It cannot come suddenly from nowhere. It has been growing with you.\nNobody wants to talk to old people for the simple reason that they are irritable, annoyed easily, expect too much, and to you they look a little insane. Perhaps their mind is tired; not only are they retired, their sanity also is retired.\nThree old men were sitting on a bench in a public park. One was seventy-five, the second was eighty and the third was ninety. They used to meet there every evening. The whole day they waited for the evening, because they were the only friends. Everybody else was far below their age. And there was such a generation gap that there was no question of making friends with anybody else.\nAll the three persons were retired, but that evening the first seventy-five-year-old man was looking very sad, ashamed. The second old man asked, \"What is the\nmatter with you? Why are you so sad, so ashamed? What have you done?\"\nHe said, \"Don't ask. A beautiful lady was taking a bath -- she was a guest in our house, and I was peeping from the keyhole and my mother caught me red- handed. It is so shameful.\"\nBoth the other old men looked at each other and laughed, and they said, \"Don't be stupid, everybody does such things in childhood, everybody gets caught. There is no need to feel so ashamed about something that happened in childhood.\"\nHe said, \"What are you saying? It happened this morning! And I don't know how I am going to go back home. I wanted to die at that very moment.\"\nThe second man said, \"I can understand your problem. I have also my problems. They are bigger than yours. It is now the seventh day that I have not made love to my wife. The moment I say, `What about it?' she simply turns to the other side and says, Ì have such a headache and I am so tired. Just go to sleep.'\"\nThe third old man laughed and said to the first old man, \"Just ask him what kind of love he makes to his wife.\"\nAnd he asked, \"What kind of love do you make?\"\nHe said, \"Love? I take her hand into my hand and press it three times. And then we say good night and go to sleep. What more can I do at this age?\"\nThe oldest said, \"Your problems are childish, stupid. I am facing the real problem. This morning my wife slapped me, and I said, `Why are you slapping me?' She said, `What are you doing?' I said, Ì'm preparing to make love.' She said, `You idiot, neither do you sleep the whole night nor do you let me sleep. This is the third time you are making love.' So I think I'm losing my memory.\"\nJust watch people.…\nIf you are alert and silent and sane you will be simply surprised what goes on happening all around.\nMy whole effort here is to create a commune of people who are completely free from past conditions, fanatic religions, fascist political ideologies, and who start\nresponding to life out of silence and peace, awareness, consciousness, not through a mind which has no eyes. It is blind. It reacts immediately like any mechanism. But it has no eyes to see directly and deeply into any problem.\nEven the greatest people that you know in the world behave very childishly, and they are creating millions of problems for other people because they have power. The whole power is in insane hands; not a single powerful man in the world is even interested in meditation -- and except meditation there is no way out. We are really coming to the crescendo of the insanity of centuries.\nIn all of our lifetimes we are going to see the ultimate madness exploding by the time this century comes to an end -- and it is not long. It is now nineteen eighty- seven; the year two thousand is less than thirteen years away. In these thirteen years things will go on becoming more and more insane.\nJust the other day I received a letter from Oregon, from a doctor, a dental surgeon, \"I am very ashamed by the way the American government treated you and the commune. You had brought a new colorfulness to the state of Oregon. Rather than rejoicing in that colorfulness, they destroyed the whole commune.\"\nMany intelligent people in America feel the same way, but the old problem -- those intelligent people feel but they remain silent, because they know the majority is absolutely insane. They are so insane that they destroyed the commune illegally, they imposed crimes on me of which I have not even dreamt.\nThey blackmailed me through my attorneys, because they made my attorneys afraid that if they were going to insist on trial, then my life might be at risk because the American government would not like to be defeated by a single individual: \"You know and we know that we don't have any evidence, so your victory is certain. But remember, your victory would mean the assassination of Osho.\"\nIt was made so clear by the government attorneys to my attorneys, that they came to me and said, \"We have never seen such a thing happening. It is absolutely insane, absolutely illegal, criminal. Now they want you to accept any two crimes, the smallest crimes, but accept that you are guilty of two crimes so that they can save the face of America and American democracy and American justice. And once you have accepted two crimes then there will be no trial and you will be freed.\"\nI was very stubborn. I told my attorney, \"It is better to fight the case because they don't have any evidence and they cannot have any evidence.\"\nBut the attorney said, \"The question is of blackmail. They are threatening us that they will withdraw the bail and they will put you in jail. And they can go on postponing the case for ten years, fifteen years, and in these ten or fifteen years they will harass you, torture you. And we are afraid they may even take your life, because they have made one thing clear, that the government is not ready to be defeated by a single individual.\"\nWith tears in their eyes they begged me, \"Don't insist on a fight. We know that you have not committed any crime, and they know it. And we had not gone to negotiate with them; they came to us to negotiate.\"\nThis is very strange -- that the government should come to the criminal to negotiate... for what? If I have committed the crime I should be punished. What negotiations? Is it a business?\nBut the reason was clear: they knew they could not prove anything against me. And the Attorney General of America later on accepted -- when I had left America -- that I had not committed any crime; they didn't have any proof, any evidence, any witness. But you will not believe that even knowing this, they blackmailed my attorneys. They cried and I had to accept, because they told me, \"It is absolutely futile. It is hitting your head against the wall for no meaning. It will destroy your whole movement, it will destroy all your sannyasins, and you will leave millions of people who love you. It is better to accept two crimes.\"\nI said, \"I am not a serious man. I can accept all of their thirty-four crimes. There is no problem, but don't ask for any proof, because I don't have any evidence either.\"\nThey said, \"No, nobody is going to ask for evidence.\"\nAnd what happened? As I accepted two crimes the judge immediately ruled that I am punished with four hundred thousand dollars -- that is nearabout sixty lakh rupees -- for two crimes which I have not committed, which they have forced in a blackmail way threatening my attorneys that my life is at risk, \"just to save my life!\" But they never mentioned that once I accepted then sixty lakh rupees will be the fine. They did not mention that. This was the second trick.\nFirst they blackmailed, \"This way there will be no trial and we will release Osho immediately.\" But with the judgment the judge came -- four hundred thousand dollars.\nMy people who were present in the court immediately collected that much money within ten minutes, because the attorneys were concerned to get me out of America as quickly as possible. And as I was coming out of the jail, immediately another summons for some other case that they had created in another court... They were waiting outside the jail to give me the summons.\nAs I was coming to the airport I received the news that they had put a bomb under my chair. They were waiting that if I didn't accept, and I wanted to go with the trial, then they would just explode the bomb and finish the whole thing, so there would be no person and no question of any trial.\nNow that bomb cannot arrive inside the jail and under my chair without somebody who is not part of the government, who is not part of the high authorities of the jail... The jail had no interest in killing me. The idea must have come from Washington -- it must have come from Ronald Reagan.\nThese people who are in power are lying, blackmailing -- doing every kind of act that is inhuman. But perhaps they are doing it in their insanity, in their unconsciousness.\nAnd there is no great movement in the world to counter the forces of violence, madness, except our movement for meditation.\nThe responsibility is great on each of you. Not only for your own sake, but for the sake of preventing the mad powers from destroying this beautiful planet -- this planet which has produced a Gautam Buddha, a Jesus Christ, a Zarathustra; this planet which has given birth to a Krishna, to a Mahavira, to a Lao Tzu. And these are just the beginnings of spring; there are higher possibilities in the future.\nIf man goes on living on the earth, we will be producing even higher peaks than we have produced in the past. Those high peaks in the past were produced in spite of all the hindrances of the society. If the society is supportive, we can create so many beautiful people around the world that it can turn from a desert into an oasis.\nAnd that's what the dental surgeon reminded me of in his letter: \"We miss you;\nyou turned a desert into an oasis, and we feel ashamed that the American government did something absolutely wrong. You brought a message which could have saved not only America but the whole of humanity.\"\nThey are missing now because that small commune in Oregon had become suddenly more important than Washington itself. All the eyes from all over the world were concentrated on the commune: \"What is happening there? Why are people so happy?\nWhy are people so loving? Why is there no fighting? Why is there no murder? Why is there no suicide? What has happened to those people? Their jealousies, their conflicts seem to have disappeared, they have entered, it seems, into a new state of consciousness.\"\nBut as far as I am concerned I have no complaint against anybody. My own feeling is it was good that they destroyed the commune. It helped my people to spread all over the world. And wherever my one sannyasin is, he will create the right atmosphere. And a few people are bound to gather around him to create small communes all over the world.\nNow I'm not interested in creating a big commune, because any big commune is going to be destroyed by the power that is any government. It does not matter whether it is the Indian government or the American government. If I create a big commune again, which is possible now... The moment you have a power, although your power is of love and peace and silence, the powerful people in New Delhi will start getting disturbed.\nI don't want to repeat history. Only idiots repeat history.\nSo my new idea is that we will not create a big commune that unnecessarily comes into conflict with the powers. We will create small communes all around the earth so nobody will be worried, because a few people cannot be dangerous to the vested interests, but those few people can make the whole world afire with love, with peace, with silence, with blissfulness.\nOkay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.\nThe Invitation Chapter #30\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"88588","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_invitation/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_invitation/>The Invitation</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: G-d</h1><div class=post-meta>416 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;88588 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Invitation/part3.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

G-d<span id=bookmark5>‌</span></h2><p>29 August 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium Archive</p><p>code:</p><p>8708295</p><p>ShortTitle:</p><p>INVITA17</p><p>Audio:</p><p>Yes Video:</p><p>Yes Length:</p><p>119</p><p>mins Question 1</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>DOES PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY HELP TO GO BEYOND THE MIND?</p><p>Vijen, psychological therapy can help you to understand the mind, but
it cannot lead you beyond the mind.</p><p>Only one thing leads you beyond the mind and that is meditation.
Meditation has nothing to do with psychotherapy, but psychotherapy can
create a ground by</p><p>giving you a better understanding of your mind to go into meditation.
It cannot lead you directly into the transcendental, but it can be a
help, just the way you prepare a garden. First, you prepare the soil,
but that is not the garden. And just preparing the ground, removing the
weeds, the grass, any wild growth, stones, roots, still it is not the
garden -- this much psychotherapy can do.</p><p>Now you will have to put seeds, give nourishment to those seeds, care
and love and protection. And slowly, slowly the bare ground will start
becoming greener. One day there will be flowers and fruits.</p><p>Psychotherapy is only a cleansing process, but it is like all
cleansing processes. You have to clean your house every day; it is not
as if once you have cleaned it you have cleaned it forever. Within
twenty-four hours again dust gathers. You have to take a bath every day,
or twice; otherwise you will start getting dirty.</p><p>Psychotherapy is good as a cleaning method, but it does not go beyond
that. And if you remain addicted to psychotherapies you will have to
clean yourself again and again. You will have a better understanding of
the mind but just that much is not enough to create the world of the
beyond. For that, seeds of meditation, awareness, watchfulness are
absolutely necessary.</p><p>And once you have gone beyond the mind, psychotherapy becomes
meaningless. Going beyond the mind simply means you have realized your
own being. Now mind is left far behind. Going beyond the mind also means
that now mind is going to function as a servant and you are the master.
So whenever you need to, you can use it. Right now the situation is just
the reverse. You are not the master, and the mind uses you. The mind is
almost blind and it directs your life and sooner or later you are going
to fall into a ditch.</p><p>All minds lead finally to misery, to suffering.</p><p>Meditation is the only possibility for creating a space where
blessings shower.</p><p>I am not against psychotherapies. I am simply telling you they can be
used as a foothold to jump into meditation. You can jump into meditation
directly too, but you will find it a little difficult because you don't
have a clean mind and a clean understanding. The mind will put every
weight on you and drag you backwards. Psychotherapy is instrumental,
helpful, but alone it is meaningless. I am using psychotherapy in this
commune as a means towards meditation, as a help, as a preparation.</p><p>But in the West psychotherapy is used as an end to itself; hence
psychotherapy in the West is not of much use. Unless it becomes a
stepping-stone for meditation, you are moving in a circle. Every day you
will have to clean. Once in a while you will have to go to a
psychotherapist. People become addicted because it gives you a clean
feeling, but that clean feeling remains only for a few days; again you
have gathered all the rubbish.</p><p>Psychoanalysts ordinarily give their patients two sessions per week,
for years, ten years, fifteen years, and still nobody is beyond the
mind. After fifteen years of psychoanalysis one simply becomes addicted
to psychoanalysis; now it has become a necessity. If you don't go twice
a week to a psychoanalyst you gather too much tension, too much dust,
you feel too dirty, too heavy. Now you have created a new problem.
Psychology rather than giving you freedom has given you new chains. It
is as addictive as any alcohol or any drug. Nothing is wrong in it; in
itself it is helpful and beautiful, but you should use it for something
better.</p><p>Psychoanalysis is good but the good is the enemy of the best. You
should not get addicted to the good. You should use the good as a
stepping-stone for the best; otherwise it turns into an enemy.</p><p>Even psychoanalysts are very embarrassed by the fact that there is
not a single man in the whole world who has been perfectly
psychoanalyzed. And I am amazed at their stupidity.</p><p>Hoping that some day some man will be perfectly psychoanalyzed is
exactly like hoping that some day some house will be perfectly clean and
there will be no need to clean it again. It is absolutely absurd. The
house will need cleaning continually, because as time passes dirt
gathers.</p><p>Even the cleanest mirror needs cleaning once in a while because dirt
gathers on it, vapor gathers on it; it does not reflect clearly, it
starts reflecting distortions. There will never be any man perfectly
psychoanalyzed, because the process in itself is only of cleaning. Can
you get your clothes cleaned forever, perfectly cleaned? They will again
become ready to go into the laundry. So the people who are going
continuously into psychotherapies are going into a kind of laundry, dry
cleaning. It is good, but good is not enough.</p><p>Vijen, in a sense it can help if you use it as a means and you don't
forget that it is</p><p>not all.</p><p>In another sense it can be a disturbance, a barrier, if you think
that this is all and there is nothing else beyond it.</p><p>That's what is happening in the West. Psychotherapists think this is
the ultimate, but they have not produced a single buddha. Even their
founders, Freud or Jung or Adler are not awakened people. They are
living in the same misery, in the same suffering as you are living. They
are full of fear. They don't know anything about death, that it is a
fiction.</p><p>They have not experienced their own being. They are just scratching
on the surface. Mind is your surface; your being is in the center. How
much you clean your surface does not matter, it is not going to lead you
to the center. If you can use psychotherapy as a means it is good. If
you think it is the end it is the enemy of your transcendence. It all
depends on your intelligence.</p><p>A Jew asks his rabbi, "I have two problems. I have asked my boss a
dozen times already, but he is determined to fire me at the end of the
month."</p><p>"And what is the other problem?" asks the rabbi.</p><p>"Ah well, my wife does not get pregnant, although she stays home and
prays all day,"</p><p>answers the Jew.</p><p>"You are doing it wrong," suggests the rabbi. "Next time you stay at
home to pray and send your wife to ask the boss."</p><p>Three months later the happy Jew thanks the rabbi: "Your help has
worked! The boss has rehired me and my wife is pregnant!"</p><p>The rabbi was certainly a great psychoanalyst and did help the poor
fellow. If you need this kind of help then psychotherapy is good, but
don't ask for more.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I FEEL I CAN RELAX MORE AND MORE DEEPLY INTO MYSELF. YET, AT THE</p><p>PERIPHERY, THERE IS AN UNASSERTIVENESS, A TREMBLING THAT CAN</p><p>CLOUD THE BLISSFULNESS OF LIFE.</p><p>BELOVED MASTER, DOES MY EGO NEED NOURISHMENT?</p><p>My God! Prem Rajya, I wonder whether you have been listening to me.
Every day, morning and evening, I'm telling you to drop the ego and you
are asking me a great question: "Beloved master, does my ego need
nourishment?"</p><p>And you are also saying, "I feel I can relax more and more deeply
into myself. Yet, at the periphery, there is an unassertiveness, a
trembling that can cloud the blissfulness of life.</p><p>Does my ego need nourishment?"</p><p>That will destroy whatever relaxation you have, and that will stop
your growth going inwards. It will make your trembling more strong and
the cloud that is covering the blissfulness of your life will become
darker. Nourishment of the ego is against your authentic being; it
cannot help you in any way. It can only destroy you -- destroy you as
you are destined to be by your nature.</p><p>Ego is a false mask; it will hide your original face. Don't ask for
its nourishment. In fact, cut off all nourishment to it. Let it die. The
death of the ego will be the beginning of your real life. The more the
ego becomes strong, the less is the possibility of any realization of
yourself.</p><p>Little Ernie was taking a walk in the park with his father, when
suddenly a bee settled on a rock in front of them. Just for spite, Ernie
picked up a piece of wood and smashed the bee, whereupon his father
said, "That was very cruel, Ernie, and for being cruel you will get no
honey for a year."</p><p>Later, Ernie deliberately stepped on a butterfly. "And for that,
young man," said his father, "you will get no butter for a year."</p><p>When they returned home, Ernie's mother was fixing the dinner. Just
as they</p><p>entered the kitchen, she saw a cockroach and immediately crushed it.
Ernie looked at his father mischievously and said, "Will you tell her,
Dad, or shall I?"</p><p>Your question really makes me wonder how you have been listening. And
perhaps this is the state of many of you. You listen to what you want to
listen, not what is being said.</p><p>You go on continuously interpreting according to your old prejudices.
Your mind is continuously interfering; it does not allow what is being
said to reach to your heart. What reaches to you is something else,
distorted, disfigured, maybe so distorted that it is almost the opposite
of what has been said.</p><p>One has to learn very earnestly the art of listening. It is a
difficult art, and the greatest difficulty is that everybody thinks he
knows it. Just because you can hear, you think you can also listen. And
these are two differing things, so different that unless you start
listening you will never know the difference.</p><p>In the dictionaries they mean the same thing, but in actual life
hearing is only because you have ears. Listening happens when just
behind your ears there is no noisy mind but a silent, receptive
alertness. If there is a continuously chattering mind behind the ears
you only seem to listen. Then there are going to be
misunderstandings.</p><p>I myself was very shocked when I came to know that psychologists have
discovered that the mind does not allow ninety-eight percent of
information to reach you. It only allows two percent; ninety-eight
percent is simply rejected in many different ways. Either it gives it a
new color, a new meaning, or it misses it deliberately, takes it into a
different context where the meaning changes. But the distortion
percentage is ninety-eight percent.</p><p>The two percent it allows without distorting, because it agrees with
its old structure.</p><p>So it listens only to itself. Those two percent are agreeable to the
mind and so it immediately allows them in without creating obstructions,
without creating arguments, doubts, misinterpretations. And language is
vulnerable; each word can mean many things.</p><p>The mind has the capacity to choose any meaning it wants, any meaning
that fits with it.</p><p>The art of listening is based on silence in the mind, so that the
mind does not interfere, it simply allows whatever is coming to you. I
am not saying you have to agree with it.</p><p>Listening does not mean that you have to agree with it, neither does
it mean that you have to disagree with it. The art of listening is just
pure listening, factual, undistorted. And once you have listened then
comes the point whether you agree or not, but the first thing is to
listen.</p><p>If you listen to something which is true there is no question of
disagreement. If it is untrue, naturally you have to disagree with it.
But your agreement or disagreement should come not from the prejudiced
mind, but from the unprejudiced heart. Listening is from the heart, and
hearing is from the mind, it is very superficial. And because the heart
is deeper, any word that enters you first has to encounter the mind.
Before it reaches the heart, the mind has done many things with it.</p><p>A man is standing at the bar and another guy walks up to him and
says, "Are you Joe Smith?"</p><p>The man says, "Yes."</p><p>The guy says, "Were you in Chicago a few weeks ago?"</p><p>Joe says, "Just a minute," and takes out his notebook, turns some
pages, and then says,</p><p>"Yes, I was in Chicago a few weeks ago."</p><p>The guy says, "Were you in room two one three?" Joe looks in his
notebook and says, "Yes."</p><p>The guy says, "Did you meet Mrs. Wentworth in room two one four?" Joe
looks in his notebook and says, "Yes."</p><p>The guy says, "Tell me, did you make love to Mrs. Wentworth?"</p><p>Joe scans his notebook again and says, "Yes, I made love to Mrs.
Wentworth."</p><p>The guy says, "Well, I'm Mr. Wentworth and I don't like it."</p><p>Again Joe looks in his notebook and says, "You know, that's funny. I
did not like it either."</p><p>This is what you call hearing. He agrees perfectly, but he hears only
what he wants to hear; he understands what he wants to understand.</p><p>And this is almost our everyday situation. At least here with me, you
have to change this pattern, you have to be utterly silent because
things are being said to you which can bring a transformation in your
whole life. Here you are not learning geography or history or
philosophy; here you are learning the very art, the alchemy of
transformation. It is not collecting knowledge and information and
becoming more knowledgeable.</p><p>The effort here is just the opposite: to make you less knowledgeable
and more innocent, to the final point where you can say, "I don't know
anything." Just like a newly born child, you are pure consciousness,
unscratched, unspoiled. This is the state of a sage, of a wise man. His
life has a completion. From childhood he began and he moved the whole
circle of life. Back he has come again to the same point that he has
left in his childhood, the pure consciousness which knows nothing but
reflects everything. He is capable of understanding everything exactly
as it is without any distortion because he has no prejudices to distort.
The state of the sage has no preconceived ideas to mix and to mess and
to disfigure.</p><p>There is a story in the life of Lao Tzu. I have loved it very
much...</p><p>He used to go for a morning walk deep in the mountains very early
before the sunrise when it was dark and there were still stars in the
sky. And he used to go to the peak from where the sunrise was the most
beautiful. And he would stand there sometimes for hours, just watching
the sunrise, listening to the birds, seeing the trees dancing with joy
and life, opening their flowers, releasing their fragrance. And then he
would come back.</p><p>One of his neighbors used to come with him. And he knew that Lao Tzu
did not want to talk at all, because that would be a disturbance in his
deep communion with nature. He had told him, "If you don't use any words
not even hello, you can come. Silently you can join me, silently you can
follow me, silently we come back; there is no need to say even goodbye.
Words have to be completely dropped if you want to come with me."</p><p>The neighbor loved it all. He had never thought that things can be so
beautiful because he had never seen the world with such a silent
peaceful mind, and with such a beautiful man who must be vibrating his
silence and his blissfulness to the neighbor. Because they had been
doing it for years now, the neighbor had completely forgotten that it
was a strange type of morning walk.</p><p>People go, and they talk and they discuss and they argue. They don't
look at the trees, they don't look at the disappearing stars, they don't
look at the rising sun. They are so much involved with their minds that
who is there to look at all the beauty, all the joy of existence, the
life again coming back from its sleep as the sun has set the day
before.</p><p>There is everywhere celebration, in the trees, in the flowers, in the
birds.</p><p>The man was immensely grateful to Lao Tzu that he allowed him to be
with him for so many years. Lao Tzu said, "But I had implored you not to
use language. Why are you using language today after so many years?"</p><p>He said, "A problem has arisen. A guest is staying with me and he
also wants to come tomorrow."</p><p>Lao Tzu said, "The condition you have to tell him. He should remember
that nothing has to be said on the way, then he can come."</p><p>And the guest thought, It is a strange condition. Not a single word,
not even hello, not even a goodbye when departing...!</p><p>But his host said, "He is a very different kind of man and he will
not relax the condition.</p><p>So please forget all your etiquette and mannerisms. Simply come with
me, remain just like a shadow, and the experience is tremendous."</p><p>The experience was tremendous. When they reached to the highest peak
from where they could see the sun rising just underneath, deep down in
the valley, he forgot the condition; it was so beautiful. He had never
seen such a thing, not even in a dream. He was so overwhelmed that he
said to Lao Tzu, "It is so beautiful."</p><p>Lao Tzu looked at the host. Suddenly the guest remembered that words
are not</p><p>to be used. Nothing was said. But as they reached home Lao Tzu told
his neighbor, "From tomorrow don't come."</p><p>He said, "But you are punishing me too much, and I have not spoken a
single word. This guest is new; he does not know you. And he has also
not said much, just that it is a beautiful sunrise."</p><p>Lao Tzu said, "You say it was just a little? That fellow is very
talkative. Although he was not saying I could hear his chattering mind.
All the way he was chattering: This is beautiful, that is beautiful, and
finally, he asserted. Does he think that we can't understand beauty,
that he has to tell us? I was present; you were present; he was present.
We were watching the same sunrise; what was the need to say anything?
No, he is too talkative.</p><p>And because you brought him, and you disturbed my morning, from
tomorrow nobody comes with me."</p><p>The neighbor finally persuaded him and he allowed him back after a
week, but told him,</p><p>"Never ask if any guests can come. They don't know how to be silent;
they are too new. I have never felt any difficulty with you, because not
only do you not say anything, you don't think anything."</p><p>Thinking and speaking are not basically different. In front of a
silent man, whether you think or speak it is the same. Thinking is
talking with yourself inside. People don't hear it because they are
engaged within themselves; they don't hear even when you talk to
them.</p><p>How can they hear your inner chattering. But a man like Lao Tzu, in
the deepest meditativeness, is able to catch your chattering almost like
whispering. Even that much is a disturbance and you will not be able to
listen to what is being said.</p><p>Gautam Buddha used to initiate people, and the first thing was for
two years not to use language at all. Naturally, two years is a long
period, and if you don't use language, slowly slowly your inner
chattering also stops because it is getting no more nourishment from
outside. How long can you continue playing football on your own? You
need a partner. Slowly, slowly you become fed up repeating the same
things, because what new information will you be getting? You have
repeated the old information many times.</p><p>I have heard...</p><p>People were waiting in the waiting room of a railway station. The
train was late. A man was sitting on an easy chair and everybody was
interested in watching the man.</p><p>Sometimes he will giggle, sometimes he will even laugh loudly,
sometimes he will throw something away. Everybody was silently watching
and wondering what he is doing.</p><p>Sometimes he will make a bad face as if something bitter has come
into his mouth, and sometimes he will smile so sweetly.</p><p>Finally they could not contain themselves. The train was getting
later and later and that man was weighing heavier and heavier on their
minds. One of them gathered courage and went to the gentleman and asked,
"You have to forgive us, but everybody in the waiting room is interested
to know what you are doing?"</p><p>He said, "Doing? I'm not doing anything. I'm just telling jokes to
myself."</p><p>They said, "That makes sense why you sometimes giggle and sometimes
laugh. But why do you sometimes throw something and make a bad
face?"</p><p>He says, "When I hear some old joke I throw it away."</p><p>Now if you are telling jokes to yourself, all are old. From where are
you getting new jokes? And how long will you deceive yourself? If for
two years you have to sit silently just telling jokes to yourself, by
the time two years have passed everything is old. You will be throwing
with both the hands, and not a single giggle!</p><p>After initiating anybody into sannyas the first thing Gautam Buddha
used to say was,</p><p>"Now for two years be completely silent. Do not use language. If you
want water then show the symbol; just be dumb. Act dumb, as if you
cannot speak, so you are showing that you need water or you need food.
You can point to your stomach when you are feeling hungry. Use symbols
as if you cannot speak."</p><p>Two years were a long time, but after two years people were so calm
and quiet,</p><p>so radiant, so full of energy. Your constant chattering is destroying
your energy. So Buddha used to remind them, "Now your two years are
over, you can use language just if it is necessary. But now you are
capable of listening to what I am saying."</p><p>But many of his disciples even after two years did not use any
language. The silence of being dumb... and symbols were working
perfectly well. They have survived the two years just by making symbols,
the very essential. You cannot talk philosophy in symbols; you cannot
argue for or against God just by symbols. You can ask for water, you can
ask for food, you can ask for shelter; you can say that you are feeling
feverish or you are feeling cold or you are feeling too hot -- just
small day-to-day things which can be counted on your ten fingers.</p><p>Only then do you become capable of listening; otherwise you only
hear. And if you are capable of listening there is nothing left for you
to do. In that silence you will be able to see without any argumentation
within you what is right and what is not right. The right immediately
makes you so joyful and the wrong immediately makes you sad and aloof.
It is a totally different kind of differentiation than mental talk:
"This is right; this is wrong."</p><p>On what grounds can your mind say, "This is right"? It is your
prejudice; it is your preconceived idea.</p><p>But the heart has no preconceived ideas. It simply sees clearly. It
has eyes but no ideas. It has a clarity but no prejudices. With that
clarity it can see where the door is and where the wall is. It does not
have to think about it. Only a blind man thinks, Where is the door?</p><p>Only a blind man starts finding the door with his walking stick. You
don't do that; you don't even think about the door. If you want to go
out, you know, you see. There is no need of thinking, you simply go out
of the door.</p><p>It is not because you are not thinking that first you will try to go
through the wall, and then you think about where the door is. And after
a logical syllogism you decide, "This must be the door." This kind of
process does not take place when you have eyes. Silence becomes your
eyes. Silence becomes your criterion of what is right and what is not
right.</p><p>And the decision that comes out of silence transforms you. You don't
have to do</p><p>anything.</p><p>Mahavira, another contemporary of Gautam Buddha, a man of the same
height of consciousness as Gautam Buddha, has made two divisions of
people who attain to truth.</p><p>One division he used to call the shravakar. It means one who is
capable of listening.</p><p>Shravan means listening, and shravakar means the listener, one who is
capable of listening in the sense I have defined listening; one who need
not do anything else, just listening will be enough.</p><p>If you have a master with you, a man who knows, then listening is
enough. If you don't have a master with you naturally listening will not
help. Then you have to be a sadhu. So these are the two categories who
travel towards truth. The sadhu means the monk. He has to follow certain
disciplines; he has to perform certain austerities, fasting, praying,
chanting, the reading of the scriptures. He has to do a thousand and one
things which for the listener are not needed.</p><p>The art of listening is the simplest method of transformation.
Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YOU DON'T EXIST AS A PERSON AND YET YOU ARE THE BEING THAT I LOVE
MOST. YOU KNOW NOTHING AND YET I PUT ALL MY QUESTIONS AT</p><p>YOUR FEET. YOU ARE JUST SILENCE AND YET I CAN ONLY SING YOUR</p><p>SONG. YOU HAVE NO NAME AND YET I'M HELPLESS IN CRYING YOUR</p><p>NAME. YOU TELL US EVERY DAY THE INEXPRESSIBLE CANNOT BE SAID, AND YET
I CAN'T HELP BUT TRY AGAIN AND AGAIN.</p><p>YOU KNOW MY GRATITUDE AND YET I CANNOT RESIST TO TOUCH</p><p>YOUR</p><p>FEET AND WHISPER THANK YOU, OSHO. EVEN MORE TODAY, BECAUSE</p><p>YOU FREE ME FROM SAYING NO TO YOU. BUT NOW I HAVE A QUESTION:</p><p>SEEING HOW PAINFUL IT IS TO SAY NO TO YOU, HOW CAN I EVER DARE TO</p><p>ASK YOU ANYTHING?</p><p>Sarjano, you are asking: "Now I have a question: Seeing how painful
it is to say no to you, how can I ever dare to ask you anything?"</p><p>It is very natural to say yes when you love, just as it is natural to
say no when you don't love. But there is still a deeper layer where you
love so much that you can even say no.</p><p>Your love gives you that power. Your love does not make you a slave,
particularly as far as I am concerned.</p><p>You can say yes out of fear. Then your yes has no value. Your yes is
valuable only when it comes out of your love. The value is not in your
yes; the value is in your love. If you can understand this then you can
understand another thing also: if your no comes out of your love, it has
the same value as your yes, because the value is neither of yes nor of
no; the value is of your love. Love is absolutely capable of saying yes
or no, because love knows no fear.</p><p>Love trusts so much that it can say no without any difficulty. Saying
yes is very natural, but there may be times when you have to say no. But
the no is coming from a loving heart without any disrespect, on the
contrary, with great respect. You respect so much that you know that
your no will not be taken as a disrespectful or negative attitude.</p><p>Love gives freedom. Love is freedom.</p><p>So you need not be worried that you cannot ask for anything. Always
remember that you are free to say yes or no to me. I am not your
enslaver; I am not your jailer. Not in any sense is there a bondage
between me and you. All that exists is freedom and the love that freedom
brings.</p><p>In this freedom and loving atmosphere everything is acceptable: your
yes is acceptable; your no is acceptable. And unless this is possible,
your love is not deep enough.</p><p>What you have said in your whole question is more a statement and
very truthful, honest and sincere. There was only one question in the
end that I have answered, but I would like to discuss your statement. I
am not answering it because there is no question in it. I am discussing
it so that it can become clear to all those who are present here.
Because one day everybody has to come to this state from where Sarjano
is speaking.</p><p>He is saying, "You don't exist as a person, and yet you are the being
that I love most."</p><p>It is not only true about me. Anybody who does not exist as a person,
but only as a presence, will be loved more than anyone else. Simply
because he does not exist as a person, he attracts, provokes, invites
your love. His absence is a tremendously powerful magnet. His absence is
not emptiness; his absence is overflowingly positive. The person is not
there, but the presence is intensely there. And what is the difference
between the person and the presence? -- the same difference as there is
between the flower and its fragrance. The flower is a person, the
fragrance is only a presence. You cannot catch hold of it, yet you can
be overwhelmed by it.</p><p>A person has boundaries, limits. And one who has limits cannot give
you unlimited freedom. He himself is not unlimited. Only a person who
has died as an ego and has resurrected only as a pure being, a presence,
has no boundaries. Obviously he is capable of giving you freedom; in
fact, he cannot give you anything else. He has no boundaries.</p><p>He can also give you a world without boundaries. And naturally, you
will love such a presence more than you can love any person.</p><p>A person is a very small thing.</p><p>A presence is a vast sky full of stars.</p><p>"You know nothing and yet I put all my questions at your feet." I
know nothing, it is true.</p><p>And only a man who knows nothing is innocent. Knowledge corrupts
because it gives you prejudices, it makes you mechanical. If you ask a
question to a knowledgeable man he will not answer your question
directly, he will simply repeat some dead, ready-made formula. He knows;
his answer will come from his knowledge.</p><p>My answer will come from my innocence; hence, my answer will be a
direct response to your question. A learned man cannot respond to you --
he appears to answer you, but the answer is ready-made; it is not a
fresh, spontaneous response. It is a prerecorded answer; it does not pay
any attention to you. The answer would have been the same even if it was
asked by somebody other than Sarjano.</p><p>But my answer will be different to each person, even though the
question is the same, because I am responding each time not only to the
question, but more basically to the questioner. The questioner is the
context. The question is symbolic only. I have to answer the questioner
more. The question is only an excuse, so my answers will be different
although your question may be the same. It creates great difficulty to
so-called scholars.</p><p>One professor of Bhagalpur University has been doing research for his
doctorate on my thoughts almost for seven years, and he becomes more and
more confused. He has inquired several times, "Which answer is right?
Because for the same question you have given so many answers. You have
created such trouble for the scholars who will be working on your work
when you are gone."</p><p>That's the way scholars work. They never work on living people, they
work on dead people. They will work on Kabir, they will work on Gautam
Buddha; they will work on Raidas, Meera, whom they condemned when they
were alive. Raidas was a shoemaker and in India a shoemaker is not
supposed to be a saint. But what to do if a shoemaker becomes a saint?
He was ignored, condemned. No brahmin could go to him to ask a
question.</p><p>Kabir used to live in Varanasi, which is the Jerusalem of Hindus or
the Mecca of Hindus.</p><p>It is their ancientmost city and perhaps it is the most ancientmost
city in the world. All Hindu learned scholars belong to Varanasi. And
Kabir lived in Varanasi but he was not a brahmin. In fact, by his
profession he was a weaver. And weavers belong to the fourth class of
the sudras, untouchables. But only by profession was he a weaver; by his
birth nobody knows whether he was Hindu or Mohammedan, because their
parents... certainly he was illegitimate, as people call children if
they are not out of marriage.</p><p>According to me there are no illegitimate children; there are only
illegitimate parents.</p><p>And when I say illegitimate parents I don't mean those who are not
married, but those who give birth to children without any love. Marriage
is a formal thing. Love is the reality, the substantial reality. Any
child which is born out of a formal marriage without any love, I call
those parents illegitimate.</p><p>Perhaps Kabir was born out of a pair who were not married. Out of
fear of the society they left the child on the banks of the Ganges. A
Hindu monk, certainly a great sage, Ramananda, had gone to the Ganges
early in the morning in darkness. And the little baby who was to become
Kabir was lying down on the steps of the Ganges. And as Ramananda passed
by, the little baby just took his feet in his hand. Now Ramananda could
not leave the child touching the feet of the master although it was
going to be a condemnation for Ramananda, as to where he got the child
-- most probably it is his own child and illegitimate!</p><p>Persons like Ramananda don't care at all about the crowd and their
opinions. The child has caught his feet and he could not leave the child
there, knowing perfectly well that some parents have left him. He
brought the child to his monastery. He was a famous Hindu monk and had
thousands of disciples and they were all against him: "What are you
doing unnecessarily taking a condemnation? Give the child to us; we will
leave it there or we will leave it in some orphanage."</p><p>Ramananda said, "It is not that there is any question. The child has
touched my feet, and I cannot refuse anybody who is ready to surrender
himself."</p><p>They said, "You are getting into unnecessary trouble. The child knows
nothing; it is just accidental. You must have been passing by and he
caught hold of anything. It was not addressed specially to you, Ì am
your disciple.'"</p><p>But Ramananda said, "You don't understand. I know this child, not to
whom he belongs in this life, but on his hand is written Kabir.</p><p>Kabir is a Mohammedan name which means God; it is one of the names of
God. In Mohammedanism there are one hundred names of God. One of those
one hundred names is Kabir. So certainly the child seems to be born
either out of a father who is Mohammedan or a mother who is Mohammedan
or perhaps both are Mohammedan, but it does not matter.</p><p>Ramananda said, "I can look into the past life of the child. He has
been my child, my disciple before too. It was not accidental that he
caught my feet. He simply reminded me,</p><p>`Your poor disciple...'"</p><p>People said, "You are getting into unnecessary trouble. Nobody is
going to believe these stories. And you will be unnecessarily thought
immoral, characterless."</p><p>Ramananda said, "That doesn't matter."</p><p>He raised the child and his prediction became true. Because he said,
"One day this child will be a greater man than me. I will be remembered
only because of Kabir."</p><p>And it is true. Ramananda would have been forgotten. There have been
many Ramanandas, many Hindu saints whose names have been forgotten. But
Kabir proved to be such a great man that obviously while Kabir is
remembered you cannot forget Ramananda.</p><p>But because Kabir was not a brahmin, and certainly he was
illegitimate in the eyes of the society, brahmins, the higher cast
people, were not even ready to go to listen to him. They heard him
secondhand. They wanted to know everything about him because the people
who were going to him were changing so miraculously. He was one of the
highest categories of consciousnesses. The same category as Gautam
Buddha or Lao Tzu or Mahavira.</p><p>You reminded me of him by saying, "You know nothing and yet I put all
my questions at your feet." Knowing that I know nothing, if you still
put your questions at my feet, you are sure to find the answer. It won't
come from me, it</p><p>will arise within your own being, out of your humbleness. Just
because you have put your questions at my feet shows immense trust, an
innocence. And your trust will not go unfulfilled.</p><p>"You are just silence and yet I can only sing your song." It is true.
I am just silence, but I am not a dead silence, I am not the silence of
a cemetery. I am the silence of the mountains, the silence of the deep
forests. My silence and my song are not different. My silence is a song;
it has a music of its own. It has a dance too of its own. So you are
right, Sarjano.</p><p>"You have no name and yet I'm helpless in crying your name." Knowing
that I have no name, if you cry my name in your helplessness you will be
helped, because you are not calling me in ignorance, just believing in
my name. You know perfectly well that I don't have any name. But one has
to address some name -- it is arbitrary. Namelessness is the reality but
you cannot point a finger towards nothingness, towards silence; you
cannot pinpoint. Still it is our human weakness, we have to use
names.</p><p>Silence has no name but we have called it silence. Existence has no
name but we have called it existence. Enlightenment has no name but we
have given it a name. It is our human weakness and frailty. But if we
are aware of the fact that we are calling the nameless, then there is no
problem, any name will do.</p><p>I told you Mohammedans have one hundred names for God. I must remind
you that in fact they have only ninety-nine names. One name they have
left as nameless. That is the real name. Unfortunately the language is
incapable, but they have done well. They say,</p><p>"God has one hundred names," and then they give the list. The list
has only ninety-nine. I have asked many Mohammedan scholars, "How do you
explain this? Is there some mistake, some error? Either the man counted
wrongly or he has forgotten one name."</p><p>And not a single Mohammedan scholar could give me the right
explanation because learning is very poor.</p><p>And when I said to them, "I have my own experience. I am not a
Mohammedan, but I can give you the answer: The reality is the man has
done it deliberately. Whoever has written these ninety-nine names knows
perfectly well that one name is missing. But that is the true name which
cannot be pronounced; hence</p><p>he has left it. The number one hundred is given, but the name is not
written. So the man was neither counting wrongly nor has he forgotten
it."</p><p>When Jews write God they never use the O in the spelling. They use
G-D, because the real essence, the very center is not capable to be
pronounced. They have found a beautiful way; they leave out the O. And
in a sense the English O is also exactly the same as the English zero.
You can take it in both the senses, that God's real name can only be
zero, nothingness, what Gautam Buddha called shunyam, zero; he has
exactly called it zero.</p><p>It is perfectly right if you know that I don't have any name and
still you call my name in your helplessness; you are not committing any
wrong.</p><p>"And yet I'm helpless in crying your name. You tell us every day the
inexpressible cannot be said, and yet I can't help..." Nobody can help.
The inexpressible cannot be said, but yet every effort has to be made to
say it, knowing perfectly well every effort is going to fail, but just
making the effort is significant. Whether it succeeds or fails, that is
secondary.</p><p>You make the effort knowing that it is inexpressible, yet you tried.
You tried and you gave ninety-nine names, but finally you accepted your
defeat that no name can be given.</p><p>But a number can be given at least: the number one hundred. It is
beautiful that the man gave the number at least. Just as the English O
in God can also be interpreted, in fact should be interpreted, as zero
which is God's name. And that has been dropped because it is not
possible for human lips to utter it. The number one hundred has also
tremendous meaning. One meaning is that the inexpressible is perfect;
one hundred is a perfect number. There have been different mystical ways
but all have failed. But that failure is not something to be taken in
sadness. That failure also shows that although we have not been able to
express his name, we have caught hold of the nameless. We will not be
able to count him but we have counted everything and only he remains
uncounted; that is a way of counting.</p><p>"And yet I can't help but try again and again. You know my gratitude
and yet I cannot resist to touch your feet and whisper Thank you,
Osho."</p><p>It is true for every seeker past, present, future, that nobody can
show gratitude to existence but still one has to say something. Not that
that saying expresses the</p><p>real experience of gratitude, but at least symbolically it gives you
a certain satisfaction. You cannot express it in its totality, but you
can give it a symbolic name.</p><p>In fact what do we know, even about small things? You call a
roseflower red, but what do you know about red? If it was called yellow
what difference would it make?</p><p>One of the great philosophers of the contemporary world, G.E. Moore,
has asked the question, "What do you mean by yellow?" And all that you
can do is take him to yellow flowers, marigolds, and show him that this
is yellow. And he said, "That's what I am trying to tell you. Even a
small and mundane ordinary thing like yellow is inexpressible; it can
only be shown. And you ask, `What is good? What is beauty? What is God?
What is consciousness?'"</p><p>You don't understand that these things also can only be indicated.
They can be shown. I can take your hand in my hand and show you the
path. I can give you the direction where you will find consciousness.
But I cannot express it; I cannot give you any explanation right now
without your own experience. And if you have experience you don't need
any explanation.</p><p>Sarjano, lastly you are saying, "Even more today, because you free me
from saying no to you. But now I have a question: Seeing how painful it
is to say no to you, how can I ever dare to ask you anything?"</p><p>There is no question, no problem at all. You can say yes to me, and
you can say no to me with the same love, with the same trust, and I will
understand your love. I don't care about your words. I will know your
heart and I will know the depths of your being.</p><p>Yes and no are just trivia.</p><p>Sarjano, you have made people serious, and I hate seriousness; hence
this joke...</p><p>The psychiatrist had been working with the patient, a sex maniac, for
many months.</p><p>Finally, things had reached a point where the doctor thought that
only hypnosis may help the unfortunate patient. The doctor swung a
pendulum in front of the man's face and said, as the hypnotists do, "I
want you to imagine that this is a big</p><p>old clock pendulum, ticking away, and soon you will be asleep.
Ding-dong sleep. Ding-dong sleep."</p><p>The patient lay still for a moment and then jumped up, shouting
excitedly, "Doctor, it works! It works! My ding-dong is asleep!"</p><p>Okay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.</p><p>The Invitation Chapter #18</p><p>Chapter title: A good laugh is the greatest prayer 30 August 1987 am

I KNOW THAT IT IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE.</p><p>COULD YOU SPEAK SOME MORE ABOUT IT?</p><p>Deva Anupo, grace is one of the great mysteries of life. It is not
something physical, not psychological but something spiritual. It is not
within your power to create it. Any created grace will be false,
phony.</p><p>Grace comes as a flowering of your being.</p><p>The moment your meditation reaches to the deepest core, to the very
center of the cyclone, a tremendous silence, peace and blissfulness
arise within you. Grace is the total effect of all these qualities:
silence, peace, love, compassion, blissfulness, ecstasy. When these
things arise in you, their flame, their fire starts radiating from your
physical body.</p><p>They are so much they start overflowing. That overflowing of your
inner ecstasy is what can be defined as grace.</p><p>So it is possible a man or a woman may not be beautiful physically,
but when grace arises their physical beauty or their physical absence of
beauty is completely changed.</p><p>Whatever their physique is, is overwhelmed by something inner which
is far more powerful.</p><p>It is just like a lamp: the flame is inside; what you see outside the
glass of the lamp is the radiation. The glass may be beautiful; the
glass may not be very beautiful. The glass may be made of crystal; the
glass may be made in India. Once the inner flame is lit you don't see
the glass, you see the light. When the</p><p>inner flame is not lit you will see the glass because there is
nothing else to see. Then you will differentiate between a beautiful man
and an ugly man, a beautiful woman or a homely woman. Just to avoid the
word ùgly'</p><p>they have found a beautiful word, `homely'.</p><p>But these distinctions remain only if the inner light is still
dormant. Once the inner light comes radiating through the body, you
don't see the body, you see a beautiful radiance, a beautiful aura
surrounding the person. That is grace.</p><p>Grace transforms your physical body completely, because nobody can
see now exactly what your physical body is. The grace is so stunning,
every gesture becomes so beautiful.</p><p>Your eyes radiate a totally new silence. They open to such great
depths that they become almost unfathomable. Your words are not just
language, something more is added to them. A fragrance, a beauty, a
music, even your prose sounds like poetry. Ordinary words start having
an extraordinary effect because your inner experience gives them
authority.</p><p>Before, they were empty, just used cartridges, they had nothing in
them. Now they are still the same words; the container is the same, but
the content is a new addition to it.</p><p>Now the content radiates through the words, and you can see it in
many ways.</p><p>Gautam Buddha was born on the boundary line of India and Nepal. Now
Nepalese are not known for much beauty. They are part of the Mongolian
race. Their size is small, their faces don't show the beauty that you
will find in Kashmir. But Gautam Buddha's statues are in a way not
factual.</p><p>I don't believe that such a beautiful man was born on the border of
India and Nepal. I have been over the whole territory of Nepal and I
have never come across anything resembling this beauty. Perhaps Gautam
Buddha was also just an ordinary Nepalese, but why have the statues been
made so beautiful? The artists, the sculptors were not seeing only the
physical frame of Gautam Buddha, they were also seeing a tremendously
powerful aura around him that was making him so beautiful. And it would
have been wrong to make his statues as he would have looked before
enlightenment. So those statues are all made after his
enlightenment.</p><p>Almost the same has happened with Jesus. There has been an
inscription found in the rocks near Galilee that describes Jesus Christ
as an ugly man, extraordinarily ugly. If you had seen him he was
repulsive. His height in that inscription is only four feet five inches
and on top of it all, he is described as a hunchback. Now you cannot
call such a man beautiful. But all the statues and the descriptions by
the disciples in the gospels do not mention that he was a pygmy, four
feet five inches high, that he was ugly and repulsive, that he was a
hunchback. They describe him as poetically, as aesthetically as
possible.</p><p>And I am absolutely certain that they are not making it up. It is not
their desire to present Jesus Christ their master to the world as
beautiful. They have seen his beauty, but that beauty is not the
ordinary beauty; that beauty is of grace.</p><p>From the other side also you can see that you can sometimes find very
beautiful people, physically -- if you look they are tremendously
beautiful -- but if you are living close enough to them you will find
their ugliness starts coming out of their physical structure.</p><p>Their physical structure may be like Cleopatra, but Cleopatra to me
was not a beautiful woman. She may have had the form of a beautiful body
but her intentions and her state of consciousness were very ugly. She
cannot have any grace; she was selling her body to anybody, just to
remain the queen of Egypt. She was not using the army to fight, she was
using her own body. And great generals like Anthony were caught into her
trap. She was using her beauty for ugly ends. She could not have
grace.</p><p>So it is possible that a man or a woman may be physically beautiful,
but if his inner being is full of darkness that darkness will show.
There is no way for her to cover that darkness by any kind of makeup. In
ordinary photographs she will look beautiful. But in Russia one
scientist photographer, Kirlian, has developed very sensitive films that
also take the photograph of your aura. They not only take your physical
frame, but the light that surrounds you, that surrounds every living
being, even the trees.</p><p>Even the leaves have an aura of their own. And that aura makes such a
difference. If a man has grace he will have a tremendously beautiful
aura, so stunning to the eyes that you will forget about his physical
body whether it was beautiful or not.</p><p>Christians have not been able to explain the inscription and the
discrepancy with the gospels because they don't seem to understand the
law of grace. Kirlian is the first man as far as science is concerned
who has changed the whole approach. He takes photographs of the aura;
his photographs are not only of you, but the subtle light that is
radiating from you. There are people who have almost no aura. Their
bodies may be beautiful but their personalities will be ugly. Their
intentions and ambitions and their desires will be of a very low
character.</p><p>Kirlian has photographed people -- simple people, innocent people,
gardeners, farmers, fishermen -- with no desire to become the president
of a country, no desire to become a prime minister, not even in dreams.
It is enough for them if they can survive. They have nothing, but still
in the evening they will play on their flutes, they will dance, they
will sing. They have beautiful auras in the photographs of Kirlian. He
has opened doors of a new dimension which has not been much taken care
of because it is of no use for warmongers.</p><p>As your death approaches your aura starts shrinking. It means your
life is gathering itself at the center from where it can leave condensed
-- the way you close your shop.</p><p>He has been puzzled by many things. For example: you have five
fingers on the hand and even if one finger is cut off in an accident, in
a Kirlian photograph there are still five fingers. The one that is no
longer there still shows its aura; the aura is still there even though
the physical part is gone. There will be a difference, because the
physical fingers which are still there will show a substance in the
middle of the aura. But that one finger which is missing will show
simply a photograph of the aura; there will be no inner substance. It is
nonsubstantial, but still the aura is there.</p><p>Working deeply on it, he has given such a great contribution to
medical science, but nobody seems to use it. No government is interested
in life; all governments are in the service of death. Seventy-five
percent of national incomes are wasted on the armies and arms. People
are living only on twenty-five percent of all income.</p><p>Just the other day I was reading a calculation of a scientist who
says this is the highest peak of production in the world ever. We can
feed more people than there are on the earth. There is no need for
anybody to die through starvation. Science has provided every possible
technology, but no politician, no political</p><p>party is interested in it; no government is interested in it. Their
interest seems to be very insane.</p><p>If it was in my power, I would put all the presidents and all the
prime ministers into madhouses. That is the right place where they
belong. They are sick people; in fact, only a sick psychology can be
ambitious. A healthy psychology is not ambitious -- you are happy as you
are, so there is no need for you to become a president of the country.
Then will you be happy? No president is happy, because happiness has
nothing to do with your post, with your money, with your power. It has
something to do with your inner change, inner transformation.</p><p>Kirlian has found that six months before a person is going to die his
aura starts shrinking.</p><p>If care is taken, that man can avoid death for a few more years. In
the same way he has found that before a disease shows itself on the
body, six months before, he can guarantee that his disease is going to
come, although medically there is no way to check on him.</p><p>The only way is when the disease comes. Before the disease happens a
different kind of darkness starts to appear on that part. And different
diseases have different kinds of colors.</p><p>If Kirlian becomes part of the authoritative medical world there is
no need for people first to fall sick and then to be cured. Their
disease can be prevented even before they have become aware of it. Six
months is enough time to cure it and to check by Kirlian photography
whether it is curing or not.</p><p>In the East for centuries there has been the idea that six months
before your death, you stop seeing the tip of your nose because your
eyes start turning upwards. A dead man's eyes are turned completely
upwards; you can only see the white. That's why in every country,
immediately a dead man's eyes are closed, so nobody else becomes afraid;
nobody gets an unnecessarily fearful impression. Because if you meet a
man with completely white eyes, no black, you are going to freak out.
Perhaps you may get paralyzed then and there and fall down.</p><p>But it takes six months for the eyes slowly to turn up. Because they
are turning up, the person cannot see the tip of his own nose. What
Kirlian is saying has confirmed that old proverb to be absolutely right,
that the time is six months.</p><p>And it is not only true about men, but about leaves, about birds,
about animals. And on leaves, his work is tremendous.</p><p>One of my sannyasins sent me a thesis just a few days ago. Listening
to me he became interested and he worked a whole doctoral thesis on the
auras of the leaves. Before a leaf starts dying you cannot see: it is
still green; it is still alive. There is no way to say that it is going
to die soon, fall and disappear. But through Kirlian photography other
leaves which are going to live show a bigger aura, and the leaf that is
going to die within six months'</p><p>time starts showing a smaller aura. The day it will die it will not
show any aura, as if the whole light of life has become condensed
inside. Now it does not radiate. It is ready to leave this form of life
for another form.</p><p>But man can be immensely helped. If Kirlian photography is used on a
wider scale there is no need of so many hospitals, so many doctors;
there is no need of so much surgery, so many medicines. And this is the
problem: It is the establishment which is preventing Kirlian photography
from becoming part of medical science because it will make many
surgeons, almost all surgeons obsolete, unemployed. It will throw all
the doctors on to the streets. All the great manufacturers of medicine
will be out of business and bankrupt.</p><p>These are the problems because the establishment goes on preventing.
Nobody thinks of man as such; everybody thinks about his own interest,
money, power, investment. There are many inventions lying down in
government warehouses. Governments purchase them, and then don't bring
them onto the market, because the people who are supporting those
governments with money will be affected.</p><p>A few days ago I told you about one Japanese scientist who has been
in Hiroshima for one year. He risked his life. He allowed himself to be
open to the radiation that has still there. But it is lessening every
day; the quantity is smaller, but the radiation is there. And his thesis
was saying that radiation from atomic explosions or nuclear weapons can
be used for creative purposes. The first immense experience was that
although he is sixty-five and has been living one year in Hiroshima --
ordinarily it was expected that he would die of radiation -- now he
looks nearabout the age of forty-five. He is sixty-five. He has become
younger, he has lost twenty years, and he has become stronger.</p><p>He has created a few things, and because I have talked about him --
he must</p><p>have heard my tape or seen the video; perhaps I am the only man who
has taken an interest in him.</p><p>He is coming on the tenth of September. And he has sent me nearabout
twenty thousand dollars' worth of inventions that he has made... a belt
with uranium inside it which radiates in very minute doses.… And he has
been experimenting that if you keep that belt on your body for one year
it will give you tremendous energy, youth, long life; many diseases that
you would have suffered from, now you will not.</p><p>He has also sent a small soap-like thing. That too is covered... You
have to keep it in your bathtub and within ten to twenty minutes the
bathtub starts almost functioning as a hot springwater. It becomes hot,
and just resting in that water is enough to keep you healthy and there
is no question of you developing any diseases.</p><p>He has also sent a small bottle of which you have to take just two
drops in water. For ten minutes it keeps the water radiating and after
ten minutes it changes the whole quality of the water. It becomes
sweeter, tasteful and immensely energy- giving.</p><p>One of the most significant war material producers in America is
Lockheed. He has informed me that they wanted the sole copyright of the
belt and all that he has invented.</p><p>Whatsoever price he wants Lockheed was ready to offer him, but he
refused. And he did well because Lockheed would have used them for
destructive purposes. They would not have come on to the market for
ordinary people.</p><p>With modern science this has become a problem that any invention, any
discovery needs so much money and so much mechanism that only
governments or very big firms like Lockheed or IBM or people like these
can afford to produce them. A scientist alone cannot work; he does not
have the right instruments which are too costly.</p><p>But he was surprised that at least there is one man who supports him.
I have proposed that all the scientists of the world should make a world
academy of scientists without any question of nation or race. And they
will make it their fundamental constitution that they will function only
for peace purposes. They will function only to help man live longer,
live better, live more peacefully, live</p><p>more beautifully; live without disease, without old age, live more
intelligently. They are not going to work for any government, communist
or capitalist, Russian or American, to destroy this planet.</p><p>The same has been the case with Kirlian. His discovery is now almost
fifty years old, but no government, no medical institution has given
much attention to him. And he has given you one of the great secrets. He
can prevent all kinds of diseases happening.</p><p>The grace is your aura, and as your inner being becomes more silent
your aura becomes more radiant. And just as Kirlian's photography has
been able to catch the aura which your ordinary eyes cannot see, a
disciple in love and trust starts seeing things which an ordinary
observer, outsider, will not be able to see. He starts seeing a grace;
he starts hearing the music. He starts feeling a certain fragrance
arising from the man, who is centered in his being, who is no longer a
personality but has become innocent individuality; whose connection is
no longer with the society but existence itself.</p><p>His life is of love; he is love. That radiance of love and peace and
silence is all part of his grace. That's why I said the word `grace' has
tremendous meaning because all that meditation gives you can be put
together in one word, and that is</p><p>`grace'.</p><p>But don't create a desire for it; don't long for it. It comes if your
meditation goes deep.</p><p>You cannot do anything with grace directly, you can only wait. Your
waiting has to become so deep, so trustful, that grace will come when
the time comes. Just as the trees go on waiting for the spring -- when
it comes, it comes. They are not running after spring; they are not
making any speed. They are not creating any action movement: "Why does
spring come only once a year... why not twice, and why does it not
remain always?" The whole world is silently waiting. Except man there is
no impatience anywhere.</p><p>Impatience makes you ugly.</p><p>Impatience is a disturbance in your meditation. Learn to wait. Be
patient and trust that existence will give you whatever you are ready
for. All that you have to do is to go on deeper in meditation, beyond
mind into silence. No thoughts, no emotions, no moods, just a silent
watchfulness and waiting for whatever</p><p>existence finds you ready for.</p><p>Grace comes, but it comes without a whisper. You suddenly find it.
You feel it within.</p><p>You feel it in your movements; you feel it in your sleep; you feel it
in your speech --</p><p>everywhere you are engulfed. But the only thing that is needed on
your part is a deep waitfulness. Meditation will create watchfulness and
you have to learn the art of waiting.</p><p>Philosophical Phyllis said she has learned three discouraging things
about men. One, they go to war and kill each other when, if only they
would be patient, they would die a natural death. Two, they climb trees
and knock down apples when, if only they would be patient, the apples
would fall to the ground. Three, they pursue women when, if only they
would be patient, women would pursue them.</p><p>One has to learn the art of waiting and then millions of things will
happen to you which never happen to impatient people.</p><p>A man fell out of a tenth-storey window. He's lying on the ground
with a big crowd around him. A cop walks over and says, "What
happened?"</p><p>The guy says, "I don't know, I just got here."</p><p>You have also just got here. Be a little patient, then you will start
experiencing things.</p><p>In a school in one of Chicago's poorer districts, a questionnaire was
sent home with a girl pupil requesting information regarding the number
of brothers and sisters, her father's occupation, et cetera.</p><p>The next day she returned with a scrap of paper on which was written
the following: There are eighteen children in my family. My father can
also do plumbing and carpentry work.</p><p>Just wait. People are engaged so much. Now think of that man:
eighteen children and still he can do plumbing and carpentry work.</p><p>Give a little time to yourself and in the end you will find that is
the only time you have really lived. Even if you can just give one hour
out of twenty-four hours to yourself, to your meditation, to your
silence -- just being, not doing anything, just waiting and learning to
wait. In the end of your life you will be surprised that your
twenty-three hours have gone to waste. Only that one hour, whatever you
have gained in that one hour is still with you and is going with you;
even death cannot take it away.</p><p>Just one hour can give you immense peace, silence, blissfulness, and
slowly, slowly the aura of grace will arise around you.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>CAN YOU TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT ACCEPTANCE?</p><p>Chintan, I understand your question.…</p><p>Chintan is on the verge of death. The doctors have told him that he
cannot survive more than two months, and almost one month has passed. He
had inquired of me when the doctors had said he has some canceric growth
which was not operable, and was growing fast. Naturally, he was shocked.
A young man who has not seen life yet, has not yet lived, just in the
middle... naturally he was very shocked.</p><p>He wrote to me and I told him, "There is no need to be shocked. You
are fortunate because you know the exact time when your life will be
finished. Others are not so fortunate; they don't know. Their life may
be terminated tomorrow. Because you know exactly that within two months
you are going to die, live these two months as intensely and as joyfully
and as meditatively as possible. You cannot postpone. Others can
postpone because they are not aware when they are going to die. You are
in a good situation because you cannot postpone. You have to do
everything now."</p><p>He understood and he has been very happy, very joyous, meditating,
dancing, singing.</p><p>And his friends have written to me, "We could not believe such a
change. His doctors are in wonder; they have never seen anybody taking
his death so</p><p>beautifully, so lightly."</p><p>His question needed this context for you to understand, when he says,
"Can you talk a bit more about acceptance?"</p><p>Human languages are very poor. The word àcceptance' has a hidden
reluctance. You may not have looked into the word, but when you say,
"accept it," there is a hidden reluctance, a kind of compulsoriness,
because there is nothing else to do. So why make fuss a about it --
accept it.</p><p>This kind of acceptance is not true and authentic. I would say, enjoy
it. Unless your acceptance is enjoyment, unless your acceptance is
wholehearted -- without any reluctance, not out of any compulsion, not
out of a particular situation but out of your understanding...</p><p>Acceptance becomes a beautiful experience if it is at the same time
enjoyment. You are not accepting under the pressure of circumstances;
you are accepting on your own accord, with joy, with a deep welcome.
Then only you understand what acceptance can do to your being. In a
single moment it can change you, transform you from an ordinary human
being into an awakened human being.</p><p>But don't accept reluctantly. That is deceiving yourself because deep
down you don't want to accept. Just after two months you are going to
die? And naturally, when somebody said, accept it, what else to do?
There is nothing. The doctors are doing the chemotherapy -- they are
doing everything that is possible. But they know that nothing is going
to help; the cancer has gone beyond the limits of their cure.</p><p>Seeing the situation you can accept it, but there will be a
negativity inside you. You are accepting because nothing else can be
done. If there was some possibility to try you would not accept it. I
don't call this authentic acceptance. Authentic acceptance has no
negative tone in it, no reluctance, no resistance, no compulsiveness. It
is not because of the pressure of things and situations and our
helplessness. Don't accept out of helplessness; accept out of your
strength.</p><p>Two months are so much to live. One can live as intensely and totally
in one second as people live in their whole life. But their living is
very thin, spread all over a long time.</p><p>That does not mean that they are the fortunate ones, because
authentic living</p><p>needs great intensity and great totality, not a thin layer. A
lukewarm survival is not living. But if you know that the next moment
you are going to die you will drop everything that you were involved in,
and the only priority will be to know yourself.</p><p>Before death comes at least be aware who you are. You don't have time
to postpone.</p><p>It happened that one man used to come to a mystic Eknath for many
years. He was a devotee but there was a doubt in his mind that was
continuously pinching him. And because there were always many disciples
he could not ask. So one day he came very early, before sunrise. Eknath
was just coming out of the river. He had taken a bath before his morning
meditation in the temple. He reached Eknath and said, "Forgive me for
disturbing you at this time, but I have been carrying a question my
whole life." And he was a young man, healthy, strong; he said, "And I
cannot dissolve it, it continues. It is a disturbance between me and
you."</p><p>Eknath said, "What is the problem?"</p><p>He said, "The problem is that I have seen you for many years, but I
have never seen you sad. I have never seen you angry, I have never seen
you jealous; I have never seen you in any negative state of mind. You
are always smiling and always joyous and relaxed as if there is no worry
in the world, no problem in the world. You don't seem to be concerned
even about death. You take it so lightly.</p><p>"And the problem is that a doubt arises in me whether you are an
actor or you are really enlightened? One can manage to act smiling,
always showing joyousness, taking everything lightly, never seriously.
Is it just a discipline? Have you trained yourself for it? Or is it
something that has happened to you -- it is not your doing but a
natural, spontaneous understanding that has arisen out of your
meditations? That question has been bothering me, because one man can
manage to pretend. You see actors in films and you know they are the
most miserable lot in the world, but in the film they look so joyous, so
happy, so loving, so peaceful, so courageous. If this is possible to do
in a film or in a drama, then why is it not possible to do in real life?
You need just a little control not to show your real feelings but always
to go on acting."</p><p>Eknath said, "Wait a minute. Before I answer your question I should
not forget</p><p>something that I wanted to tell you. I have been forgetting for three
days, and it is important; so first I will tell you that thing and then
I will answer your question. Just three or four days ago I happened to
look at your hand, and I was very shocked. Your lifeline is finished;
just such a small fraction has remained so that you may be able to live
seven days at the most.</p><p>On the seventh day as the sun will be setting you will be dying. This
I have been forgetting and this too is as important as your question.
Now we can discuss your question."</p><p>The man stood up. He said, "I don't have any question and I don't
have any time to discuss. If death is coming within seven days why
should I worry whether you are real or unreal. That is your business; it
is not my problem."</p><p>The man started going down the steps. There were many steps to the
temple, and Eknath watched him. Just five minutes ago he had come so
strong, so young, and now he was going just like an old man, wobbling,
taking the support of the railing that he had never taken before, afraid
to fall. And when he reached home he simply went to bed directly, even
though it was not the time, it was morning -</p><p>- he had just got up from the bed. He collected the whole family and
told them what Eknath had said.</p><p>It was inconceivable that Eknath will lie; there is no point in
lying. So there was crying and weeping, and that man stopped eating.
What is the point now when you are not going to live?</p><p>But a strange thing started happening as he became settled with the
idea that death is coming and nothing can be done. "Why not use this
time for the meditation that I have been postponing for many years?
Eknath goes on saying every day to meditate, put your energy into
discovering yourself, and I have been postponing it, because what is the
hurry? I am a young man and these things, meditation and knowing
yourself belong to the old people when they have nothing else to do.
Anyway they are out of work, retired. That is the right time to meditate
and find out who you are. Right now you have to find out many other
things -- money, power, prestige, respectability. This is not the time
to waste in finding yourself. That you can do at any moment when you
will not be of any use in life, and life will reject you by retiring
you."</p><p>It is strange that everywhere when people are retired, their
colleagues gather</p><p>together just to say goodbye to them, and they always give them a
pocket watch. That I cannot believe... what is the idea? But now I know.
They give them a pocket watch as, "Not much time is left to remind you,
but now, do the essential things that you have been postponing."</p><p>The man lay down, started watching his mind for the first time and
became utterly silent within two or three days. But the whole family and
other relatives and friends from far away arrived. They were even more
disturbed. Death is coming; that is a shock. And what has happened to
this man? He does not open his eyes; he does not eat; he does not take
any interest. This was a time to meet the family, the friends, because
who knows when you will ever meet these people again; there is not much
chance.</p><p>But he is not interested in anything. He did not even allow them to
call a physician. By the fourth day they could not believe that he was
looking so beautiful, so graceful, so silent. His whole bedroom almost
had the same quality which exists around a man of silence or which
exists in a living temple, where not only statues are, but some living
master is also present.</p><p>People came with great words prepared, dialogues which one needs to
say, because it is very embarrassing to come to a man who is going to
die. What to say to him? You cannot talk about movies, you cannot talk
about politics, you cannot talk about football games, you cannot talk
about boxing. What is there to talk about? It is very embarrassing if
somebody is dying and you have to leave. Then one prepares a dialogue to
console him,</p><p>"Don't be worried; everybody dies. It is not that it is happening
only to you. And then there is God: you have been a virtuous man, and
your heaven is absolutely guaranteed."</p><p>One has to prepare things like that because now the worldly things
that one gossips with each other are of no point. But as they entered,
even this dialogue was not possible, the man was so silent. On the
seventh day he opened his eyes and asked his family, "How much time is
left for the sun to set?"</p><p>Reading this story I remember why that pocket watch is given to
people: so they don't even need to ask anybody else; just look at your
pocket watch and be finished. Never present a pocket watch to anybody,
because that simply means that you have taken it for granted that this
man is gone. The pocket watch is the</p><p>last present.</p><p>And the people said, "The sun is just about to set within a few
minutes." And he was showing such grace, such joy, such blissfulness,
that the family could not believe the metamorphosis that these seven
days have been. They all knew he was an ordinary man.</p><p>The wife knew, the father knew, the brothers knew that he had nothing
special, but in seven days he has gone far beyond them.</p><p>Exactly as the sun was setting they all started crying and weeping.
And he was saying to them, "Be quiet. There is nothing to worry
about."</p><p>At that moment Eknath arrived. The whole family touched his feet and
told him, "Save him. Can you do anything?"</p><p>Eknath said, "With death there is no possibility. Just let me see
him."</p><p>So they all respectfully moved and gave way to Eknath. The man was
sitting silently with closed eyes, looking almost like a marble statue
of Gautam Buddha... in just seven days, and he was an ordinary person.
Eknath called his name and said, "I have come to see you and to tell you
that it was only a device. You are not going to die. You have a lifeline
that is very long. You will live almost as much as you have lived. You
have lived only half the lifeline, so there are many years to live. This
was a way to answer your question."</p><p>The man said, "My God. I never thought that this is a way to answer
my question."</p><p>Eknath said, "There was no other way. Whatever I would have said to
you, you would have remained with doubts. A man who can pretend for
years to be happy can also lie that he is enlightened. I wanted to give
you some experience of it, that it is not acting.</p><p>And these seven days have given you the experience. Have you received
the answer or not?"</p><p>The man stood up, jumped out of the bed -- for seven days he had not
left the bed at all --</p><p>touched the feet of Eknath and said, "Your compassion is great.
Unless your compassion was so great, you would not have lied. But you
have answered my question. Now there is no doubt at all. And I cannot
see that any doubt in the future is possible. I have known the space in
which you are living."</p><p>Eknath said, "It does not matter whether you are going to die after
seven days or seventy years. Once you become aware that you are going to
die, it does not matter when."</p><p>The awareness of death makes you live life as totally, as joyously as
possible. Death is not your enemy. In fact, it is an invitation for you
to live intensely, totally, to squeeze every drop of juice from every
moment. Death is a tremendous challenge and invitation.</p><p>Without death there would not have been any Gautam Buddha, any Jesus,
any Lao Tzu, any Tilopa. There would not have been any Kabir, any
Raidas, any Mansoor, any Sarmad.</p><p>It is death and its awareness that makes you live as totally, as
deeply, as consciously as possible. Before death knocks on your doors
you should be able to see the eternal life within you. Then there is no
death; death is a fiction. It is a reality only to those who have not
lived, not lived in its completeness, in its entirety.</p><p>For those who have lived there is no death.</p><p>It is only a change -- just changing the house. I am reminded...</p><p>One night a thief entered into Mulla Nasruddin's house, and Mulla
Nasruddin was trying to sleep. He had only one blanket, so half was used
as a bed and half to cover himself.</p><p>But sleep was not coming because the mosquitoes were so interested in
keeping him awake. They are great teachers who are continuously making
an effort that you should not fall asleep. Their whole teaching is
awareness. I always thought that these mosquitoes seem to be old masters
trying their old teaching. Now they cannot speak, but they can manage to
keep you awake.</p><p>So Mulla was turning and tossing, and then suddenly, he saw a thief
entering. It was a dark night and the door was open. The thief was
amazed. He hardly figured out that some man is sleeping; the house seems
to be completely empty and all doors are open -- a great opportunity. So
he entered inside the house and went on going to the innermost room, not
being aware that he is being followed by Mulla Nasruddin.</p><p>Suddenly Mulla stumbled on something so the thief became aware. Mulla
said, "Don't be worried. I have been living in this house for thirty
years; and I have not found anything up to now. But perhaps with your
expertise... we can both try to find something. Fifty-fifty?"</p><p>The thief could not believe it. What kind of man is this? It is his
own house. The thief became a little afraid; this man seems to be either
mad or very dangerous. And Mulla said, "Don't be worried. If you are not
agreeing on fifty-fifty, you can have sixty, I can have forty -- or
whatever you want. I have wasted thirty years searching and searching
and I have not found anything. So whatever you want me to give, even
five percent commission will do. You try. And I have brought a
candle."</p><p>He lit the candle and he said, "Because it is dark it will be
difficult for you. So I will keep the candle and you search."</p><p>The thief said, "I have also been stealing for the same time, thirty
years, but I have never met a man like you. You amaze me."</p><p>But there was nothing at all, so they went around the whole house.
They could not find anything. Finally the thief said, "You are right,
there is nothing to find."</p><p>As he was going out -- he had been into other houses before and he
had left all the things that he has stolen from other houses outside the
house -- Mulla went with him, threw his blanket also in the pile. The
thief said, "What are you doing?"</p><p>He said, "Nothing. I am coming with you, just changing houses."</p><p>The man said, "This is an unnecessary trouble and this man seems to
be a little crazy." He said, "You can take your blanket."</p><p>He said, "No. Either fifty-fifty..."</p><p>But he said, "I have stolen these things from other houses."</p><p>He said, "That does not matter... otherwise the police station.
Fifty-fifty? This is my only business. I keep my house open and the
thieves come; they do the business."</p><p>The man said, "You seem to be the greatest thief in the world. You
never go out; thieves come by themselves."</p><p>He said, "It has been happening. But if you want I am prepared to
come with you, because what is there in this house?"</p><p>The man became so afraid of Mulla because he could not put him into
any category. He said, "You can keep everything, just leave me... And I
will never come back."</p><p>Mulla said, "As you wish, but I was always thinking of changing my
house. You will also get the blanket and the whole treasure that you
have stolen from other houses, and me who can advise you. You are just
amateur. You may have been stealing for thirty years, but you don't know
much. I don't go anywhere and thieves come by themselves and
fifty-fifty, sometimes even more, sometimes a hundred percent. Because I
am always happy to change the house and they are afraid to take me to
their house."</p><p>The man who knows himself knows death as only changing the house.
Acceptance is not the right word, but there is no other word; this is
the difficulty.</p><p>I would say, Chintan, rejoice! Make all these days a celebration.</p><p>And if you can make all these days a celebration, your death will be
found to be a fiction.</p><p>These days of celebration and meditation and silence and joy and love
will create in you the capacity to die consciously. And one who dies
consciously knows that death is nothing but changing the house. And it
is always for a better house because life always goes upwards; it is an
evolutionary process.</p><p>I was really shocked by the American government particularly, Ronald
Reagan's</p><p>government. They have prohibited the universities and colleges and
schools to teach Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Books on the
theory of evolution have been burned or removed from all libraries,
because this theory of evolution goes against the Christian idea of
creation. You may not immediately get the difference, but the difference
is there.</p><p>God created everything so there is no question of any evolution. He
created monkeys as monkeys, and he created men as men -- not that the
monkeys have evolved into man; there is no evolution. God has made the
world perfect. Evolution is possible only if things are imperfect.</p><p>This fundamentalist, fascist, fanatical idea of Ronald Reagan has
been imposed on the whole of America, and nobody is protesting that it
is against the constitution of America.</p><p>It is against democracy; it is against freedom of expression. The
American constitution makes it clear that religion should not interfere
with people's lives, particularly via government powers: the government
should be neutral. But this is not neutrality.</p><p>And to stop the whole of America knowing anything about Charles
Darwin and his theory of evolution is dangerous, because it means you
cannot evolve. You are what you are. It is dangerous. I am not saying
whether Charles Darwin is right or wrong; that is not my business. I am
saying that the idea of evolution should not be taken away from people's
minds. In fact, they should be made more aware that for thousands of
years we are not evolving -- we should evolve.</p><p>And now outside we have got everything. Evolution should take on a
different dimension, an inner evolution. But to destroy the whole
idea...! Ronald Reagan has done much harm to America, but this is his
greatest harm, because this will mean that if the idea of evolution
completely disappears from peoples' minds, then wherever they are, God
wants them to be there: in misery, in suffering, in anguish, in angst.
But that's what God wants, and there is no possibility of evolution.</p><p>I don't support the particulars of Charles Darwin, but I support the
essential fact that evolution has been happening, because we have seen
man becoming a Gautam Buddha. I don't agree that monkeys have become
men. And even if they have, it does not bother me; it is perfectly
good.</p><p>My concern is for the future, not for the past. I want man to evolve.
It does not matter whether monkeys evolve into men or not, but man can
evolve into superman, into new man. But that evolution will happen only
through deep meditation, watchfulness, waiting and accepting life with
joy, and accepting death with joy, with no reluctance, without any
pressure, but from your innermost feeling.</p><p>Everything that is, is beautiful.</p><p>It can be more beautiful -- there is no limit to evolution.
Particularly for consciousness there is no limit; it can go even beyond
Gautam Buddha, beyond Bodhidharma, beyond all the great awakened people
of the past, because consciousness has no limits. It is as vast as the
sky, as the whole universe.</p><p>Chintan, accept with joy and dance and song.</p><p>Just a little joke so that you go from here not with serious faces.
This temple believes in laughter and I want everybody who comes here to
go laughing. Even on the way, when he remembers -- a little giggle. In
the night, in the middle of the night, then he remembers</p><p>-- a good laugh.</p><p>A good laugh is the greatest prayer.</p><p>A little boy on a picnic strays away from his family and suddenly
realizes he is lost and night is falling. After running around and
shouting for a while he becomes very frightened and kneels down to pray
with uplifted hands.</p><p>"Dear Lord," he says, "please help me to find my mummy and daddy and
I promise I won't hit my sister anymore."</p><p>Just then a bird flies overhead and shits right into his outstretched
hands. The boy examines it, looks up to heaven and says, "Lord, don't
give me this shit, I really am lost."</p><p>Everybody is really lost. Very few people have reached their home.
But your pilgrimage of finding your home should not be serious and sad
and heavy; it should be of laughter and song and dance. If you can find
your home dancing, laughing, it is true finding. By sadness and
seriousness you are bound to find</p><p>some graveyard, not your home.</p><p>We need people who are seekers but not serious. That kind of seeking,
serious and sad, has not led man anywhere.</p><p>Okay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.</p><p>The Invitation Chapter #19</p><p>Chapter title: Pick up the roses and avoid the thorns 30 August 1987

FROM MY</p><p>EXPERIENCE, WHEN I HAVE SAID NO TO YOU I HAVE DENIED MYSELF AND</p><p>THEN SUFFERED THE CONSEQUENCES.</p><p>HOW CAN THERE BE ANY SITUATION IN WHICH THE DEVOTEE WOULD SAY</p><p>NO TO THE MASTER?</p><p>Maneesha, the question you have asked raises many questions:
questions about love, questions about freedom, questions about the
master and disciple and their relationship.</p><p>Life appears to be very simple but as you go deeper into it, it
becomes more and more complex. And the ultimate complexity is that life
consists of contradictions. If you understand, those contradictions
become complementaries. If you don't understand those contradictions
become opposites.</p><p>But in the ultimate organic unity there is enough space for both yes
and no. It will not be ultimate organic unity if there is only space for
yes, if there is space only for light, if there is space only for love,
and not their opposites.</p><p>Our mind looks at things in categories of opposition, but mind is not
the ultimate decisive factor. The ultimate decisive factor is a state of
no-mind. In a state of no-mind everything is possible. The
incomprehensible is also possible; the impossible is also possible.</p><p>Apparently you are right, that the disciple cannot say no; how can
the disciple say no to the master? In what situations? It has been the
tradition that no has always been taken as negative. With me, things
have a far deeper meaning and significance. No is not necessarily
negative and yes is not necessarily positive. You can say yes out of
fear, then it is negative. You can say no out of love. You love so much
that you are not worried even to say no. The no becomes affirmative; it
is no longer negative.</p><p>As far as I am concerned, I am not part of any old category of
masters. I am a new beginning in the sense that the old master demanded
surrender. I don't demand anything from you, because to me surrender is
a subtle spiritual slavery. Of course, with a master the surrender feels
beautiful but even if slavery is decorated with flowers I cannot be
deceived by it.</p><p>I want my people to be individuals living in freedom. If they love me
it is out of their freedom, not out of fear, not out of desire, not out
of some longing for achievement. The old disciple was surrendering
himself because he wanted to be enlightened. The master was being used
as a means. I don't allow myself to be used as a means. That is
ugly.</p><p>The old master was using the disciples for his own egoistic ends. The
masters in the past used to brag about how many disciples they had. The
number of the disciples decided the greatness of the master. The master
was also dependent in a certain sense on the disciples. It is something
to be understood that you cannot make anybody dependent without yourself
becoming dependent too. And the same is true if you are independent, you
would love to make everybody independent. Because independent
individuality has such beauty and grace, such joy, such freedom to fly
in the sky with no boundaries and no chains, with no conditions, no
expectations, that a master would love his disciples to be ultimately
free, free even of himself.</p><p>Zarathustra has said to his disciples: "Beware of me." That small
statement contains great meaning, because a disciple can renounce
everything to be one with the master, to come closer and closer to the
master; he can even sacrifice himself. But in this sacrificing he will
enjoy a certain unburdening, because now he is no longer responsible.
The whole responsibility is on the shoulders of the master. The disciple
has become a sheep and the master has become the shepherd. Now the
shepherd will take care.</p><p>One can think in this way that the sheep has attained a certain
freedom -- freedom from responsibility. But becoming a sheep, even if
you become free, your freedom has no meaning. It is fear; it is
irresponsibility. In a deeper sense you have lost yourself to gain
something. It is not out of love that you have surrendered to the
master; out of love there is no surrender, there is no need.</p><p>Love is a far bigger phenomenon than any surrender. Surrender is of
the mind and surrender is an effort. Love is of the heart and it is not
an effort. You suddenly find yourself in love with someone. Even if you
try to be in love with someone you cannot succeed. No effort is going to
be successful. Love comes just like the spring comes, and when love
comes it brings many flowers.</p><p>There have been two kinds of masters. The majority of the masters in
the past demanded surrender, total surrender. It was a kind of spiritual
slavery. The master was enjoying a great ego, and the disciple was
enjoying a great unburdening from all responsibilities.</p><p>Now the master is going to save him. Now the master is his salvation,
liberation, enlightenment. All that he could do he has surrendered
himself. He has become an absolute yes.</p><p>To me this kind of relationship was not healthy, something was
basically wrong. Because of this situation in the past one man stands
separate from the whole crowd of masters, and that is J. Krishnamurti.
He denied he was a master and he refused to accept anybody as a
disciple; this was another extreme. The other masters were demanding
absolute surrender. J. Krishnamurti has lived with masters who have
asked absolute surrender from him, and as he became more and more mature
he saw the whole game: the master enjoys the ego, the disciple enjoys
irresponsibility. But neither the master is a true master nor the
disciple is a true disciple; both are exploiting each other.</p><p>There is no question of love when there is exploitation. Krishnamurti
refused to be master of anyone and he refused to allow anyone to think
that he is a disciple. He has taken a great step but he has moved to the
very extreme. And always remember: if one extreme is wrong the other
extreme cannot be right. The right is always somewhere exactly in the
middle, the golden mean. Only in the middle is there balance, and only
in the middle, exactly in the middle, is there transcendence of the
polarities, of the opposites.</p><p>My position is exactly in the middle. I don't ask any surrender from
you; hence, I am not on the old track. I don't deny you the beauty of
being a disciple. I don't insult you; I don't reject you. I accept your
love, but I will not accept your surrender. In accepting your love and
your disciplehood I am your master, but there is no relationship of
surrender.</p><p>I am not here to erase your individuality. I am here just to erase
your ego.</p><p>That does not need any surrender, it needs a deep meditative
understanding on your part.</p><p>I can give you love, I can share my own understanding with you, but
there is no condition attached to it. My joy will be to see you as a
growing individual in total freedom. And in total freedom, yes is as
much possible as no.</p><p>I can understand Maneesha's problem, that no is very difficult, more
difficult to a master who does not ask surrender. No becomes more
difficult because the master allows it. If the master does not allow no,
he is repressing something in you, and his not allowing no does not
destroy the possibility of no in you. On the contrary, the master
himself is afraid that if you are not prevented, you can say no.</p><p>The yes from you is meaningless if you are not free to say no. Your
yes has meaning only because you are absolutely free to say no. It does
not mean that you have to say no. It does not mean that there will be a
situation where you have to say no. In fact it will become more and more
impossible for you to say no.</p><p>To say no is easy when you are prevented, prohibited. Then, it
becomes a question of your individuality; it becomes a question of your
spiritual freedom.</p><p>And certainly anybody who has any dignity is bound to find situations
where he would like to say no. If he does not say it he is behaving as a
hypocrite. He is not saying no because he is afraid to lose the love of
the master and to lose the possibility of getting higher states of
consciousness.</p><p>But this is business, this is cunningness. And there should not exist
any business or any cunningness between the master and the disciple.</p><p>Krishnamurti has moved to the very extreme: no master, no disciple.
But that created an absurd situation, for his whole life, and he lived
long, ninety years. He started being a teacher at the age of fifteen,
and he wrote his first book AT THE FEET OF THE</p><p>MASTER at the age of fifteen. It was so early that later on he could
not even remember whether he had written it or not. It appeared as if in
a dream, far away, just an echo.</p><p>From the age of fifteen to the age of ninety, almost seventy-five
years continuously -- no master has been teaching so long. Gautam Buddha
was teaching for only forty-two years; so was Mahavira. Jesus taught for
only three years, because at the age of thirty-three he was crucified;
he started his teaching career at the age of thirty. Perhaps
Krishnamurti is the only person who has been a teacher for seventy-five
years.</p><p>But the question is that his situation is very absurd. If he does not
accept himself to be master and he does not accept you as disciples,
then what is he doing for seventy-five years? Running around and around
all over the world what is he doing... to whom he is talking?</p><p>The word `disciple' does not mean anything else other than a learner;
that is its original meaning. If he is not talking to people who are
ready to learn, then what is the point of talking? And if Krishnamurti
is not a master, from where does he get the authority to talk, to say
anything to anybody? He goes on denying that he is a master, and
everybody knows he is a master. And he goes on saying, "You are not the
disciples," and everybody who listens to him, learns from him, feels a
certain disciplehood.</p><p>Both are denying actualities. Out of fear that they may not get
trapped into the past relationship of master and disciple. This whole
seventy-five years of J. Krishnamurti are full of fear, the fear of the
past heritage, centuries of master and</p><p>disciple relationship, because it has become a spiritual slavery. The
disciple could not say no. Rather than allowing the disciple to say no
he simple denied that there is a disciple. It is not a great revolution;
it is just a reaction, moving from one extreme wrong situation to
another wrong situation, another extreme.</p><p>I am standing exactly in the middle. I can see both the extremes, the
right and the left.</p><p>And I can see that both are half, incomplete. Both are not going to
help anybody to attain to spiritual freedom. The first because it
insists on surrendering, and the second because it simply denies that
you are a disciple. And Krishnamurti goes on teaching for seventy-five
years continuously, and becomes angry when the listeners don't listen
rightly.</p><p>You will be surprised to know that Krishnamurti used to become very
angry at times when he saw somebody listening to him for fifty years and
still he has not understood anything. He would just look at the people
and beat his head -- it was absolutely natural. I will not say that it
was unnatural, but he created the situation. In the very first place he
denied disciplehood, and then he wants them to understand him.</p><p>I accept the status of a master and the status of a disciple. There
is nothing wrong in it if the master and disciple are not exploiting
each other. If the disciple is not using the master as a means to
enlightenment, liberation, and the master is not using the disciple for
his own aggrandizement, for his own ego-fulfillment. I want disciples
and masters to stand side by side in deep love, with no question of any
surrender, with no expectation from the master that you have always to
say yes.</p><p>My own experience is the more you are prohibited from doing something
the more there is a desire to do it. Prohibition is a kind of
provocation.</p><p>I don't prohibit you.</p><p>It does not disturb me or my individuality if you say no. On this
point Maneesha is right, that whenever she has said no, she has suffered
the consequences. But that is up to you --</p><p>not my expectation. It is going to be your understanding that when
you say no, you have taken yourself as if you are wiser; you will suffer
the consequences.</p><p>I have not said to Sarjano, "You will not suffer the consequences of
your no." But it will not be from me: not that I will be annoyed, not
that I will be irritated, not that I will be angry. It is perfectly okay
with me whether you say yes or no. But for yourself there is going to be
a difference. Yes means you are listening and following what I am
saying. No means you are deciding for yourselves. As far as I am
concerned you are absolutely free to decide for yourself, but then you
have to be ready for the consequences also.</p><p>Freedom brings responsibility.</p><p>That's the meaning I continuously repeat, and I know you don't
understand. Everybody likes freedom and nobody likes responsibility, but
they come in the same package; you cannot separate them. I give you
freedom AND I give you responsibility. You cannot complain about me,
because you are always free to say no. You cannot say that I have
inhibited you, because I have not asked that you say yes whether you
want or not. You cannot blame me.</p><p>This is absolutely true, that whenever you will say yes, you will
find a peace, a silence.</p><p>And whenever you will say no, you will find a deep burden on your
heart, almost a wound. But you are creating that wound. And I will not
prevent you, because I know that preventing provokes people to do the
same thing that is being prevented.</p><p>A famous Tibetan story...</p><p>A man was serving an old master continuously, bringing food, bringing
water from the well, massaging his feet. And the old man used to say,
"Why are you wasting your time?"</p><p>because the old man understood perfectly that there must be some
desire.</p><p>Finally, one day the man said, "I am serving you because I want to
learn some miracle, just one miracle."</p><p>The old man said, "But I don't know any miracle. You have
unnecessarily wasted your time. You should find somebody else who knows
about miracles."</p><p>But the man said, "I have been told that you always deny that you
know any</p><p>miracles, and you go on continuously performing miracles. I have been
told,</p><p>`Don't listen. Go on serving him. One day he will tell you some
secret, but only when he finds you are ripe.'</p><p>Perhaps I am not ripe yet."</p><p>After a few days the old man saw that this man is still unnecessarily
working. "Somebody has put the idea in his mind that I perform miracles.
Perhaps miracles happen, but they happen on their own. I am not the
performer."</p><p>With people of great consciousness things happen just on their own.
Just as when the sun rises birds sing; it is not that the sun is
performing a miracle. Flowers open their petals, not that the sun is
performing a miracle, just the presence of the sun and things start
happening. The presence of a very conscious awakened man is enough for
many flowers to open, for many birds to sing.</p><p>The old man said, "It seems you will not leave me unless I tell you
the secret." The man said, "That's true."</p><p>So he said, "I will tell you the secret. I wrote a small mantra, the
Tibetan mantra om mani padme hum."</p><p>Om means the eternal sound of existence. Diamond in the lotus, mani
padme hum: mani means diamond, padme means lotus. It means the eternal
sound and the diamond in the lotus. It expresses the meaning of
enlightenment: the eternal music all around, the beauty of the lotus,
and inside the lotus the light of a diamond. In a small mantra they have
condensed the whole experience of enlightenment.</p><p>So the old man said, "Take this mantra and repeat it five times, just
five times. First take a bath, change your clothes to fresh clothes,
close your door, sit alone and repeat the mantra five times. Then you
will be able to do any miracle you want to do."</p><p>The man rushed, he did not even show his gratitude or even say just a
Thank You. He simply rushed down the steps of the temple. When he was
just in the middle the old man shouted, "Wait, I have forgotten one
thing. While you are repeating the mantra remember one thing: don't
think of any monkey."</p><p>The man said, "Why should I think of a monkey? I have never thought
of it in my whole life!"</p><p>The old man said, "That's okay, just remember that. No monkey allowed
at all. If the monkey comes in you have to repeat the mantra five times
again."</p><p>The man said, "But why should the monkey come?"</p><p>The old man said, "I don't know. I have told you the secret. This is
the secret my master has told me."</p><p>But he could not even get down the steps before he started thinking
about monkeys. He said, "My God, I have not started the mantra yet and
monkeys are coming." He will close his eyes and there were monkeys and
monkeys, giggling, making faces at him. He said,</p><p>"It is a strange mantra. I have not started yet."</p><p>He reached home crowded with monkeys. Wherever he will look, he could
see only a monkey. He went inside, took a bath, but it was no use. Even
in the bathroom, inside the bathroom with the door closed, monkeys were
sitting all around. He said, "That old man is such an idiot. If this
monkey was the trouble he should not have mentioned it.</p><p>Elephants are not coming, camels are not coming, lions are not
coming; nobody is coming except the monkey."</p><p>Then he sat in a lotus posture with closed eyes but it was useless.
The monkeys were nudging him; the monkeys were sitting; it was a
congregation of monkeys all around. He was very worried. His wife
passed, and he looked and sometimes it looked as if she is a monkey and
sometimes she looked..."No, no, she is my wife." His father passed. And
sometimes he looked like an old monkey, and sometimes he looked like the
father. The man said, "I'm going mad."</p><p>Five times was too much. Even to complete the mantra om mani padme
hum, just those four words, and there were so many monkeys. The whole
night he tried hard. He took a bath many times. He thought perhaps the
clothes are not as fresh as they should be, so in the middle of the
night, in the cold winter, he stood naked. Now there was no question of
dirty clothes or anything. But the monkeys were sitting in lotus posture
all around. He started shouting at them and they</p><p>laughed.</p><p>By the morning he was almost mad. He said, "That old man is tricky.
For years I served him. Finally he gave me the secret and managed to
destroy the secret by keeping the monkey with it."</p><p>He went back to the old man, returned the mantra and he said, "Keep
it with you because those monkeys..."</p><p>The old man said, "You said they never come to you."</p><p>He said, "I have not dreamt or seen or even thought about a single
monkey in my whole life. There are millions of animals I have not
thought about; there is no need. If you had not said the word I would
have been able to perform miracles but now it is impossible."</p><p>The master said, "What can I do? That monkey comes with the mantra.
Without the monkey the mantra is useless. Unless you can avoid the
monkeys you cannot perform miracles."</p><p>He said, "I have forgotten all miracles. I just pray that you take
your mantra and relieve me of the monkeys, because I am afraid that the
mantra is gone but the monkeys may not go. And I have small children and
a wife and an old father. I have to take care of them. I cannot go on
fighting with these monkeys the whole day and night."</p><p>The old man said, "Once you have left the mantra with me they will
not come. They are very religious people."</p><p>The man went. And he was surprised, he looked all around, no monkey.
When he reached home, the wife looked like the wife, the father looked
like the father and the children looked like the children. He said, "It
is strange." He took a bath, the bathroom was empty.</p><p>The mantra was short. He said, "Although I have returned his written
mantra, I have been repeating it the whole night, so I have remembered
it. There is no harm... now I can repeat it."</p><p>The moment he started one monkey appeared just as he said Om. And a
few monkeys were around saying Om. He dropped the whole idea. He said,
"I should</p><p>go to my shop and look at my business. This idea of performing
miracles is not for me."</p><p>If I say to you, "Never say no to me," you will find many many times
the desire to say no; hence I give you absolute freedom. It is up to you
to say yes or to say no. You are to decide your own destiny. I can only
help you, suggest to you, show you the way. But you can say, "I don't
want to go" -- I cannot force you. You can accept my understanding.</p><p>You can reject it, and in your rejection I don't think that there is
less love. That's why I said if you deeply love me you will not be
worried by saying no. But I have not mentioned anything that will happen
to you.</p><p>By saying no you are relieving me from responsibility. You are taking
the responsibility into your own hands. Now if things go wrong you
cannot complain about me. When you say yes and things go right I cannot
brag about it. The yes is yours; the no is yours; the consequence will
be yours.</p><p>I love you enough -- hence I give you total freedom. If you love
yourself enough, you will be aware what no can do to you and what yes
can do to you.</p><p>I teach you awareness and then leave you. A man of awareness will not
try to go through the walls, he will find the door. A man of awareness
will pick up roses and will avoid the thorns.</p><p>I give you freedom, and in giving you freedom I feel absolutely free.
I don't have any burden of solving, saving, liberating humanity. I don't
have any burden at all. I am absolutely weightless. I am not a savior,
not a messiah, not a messenger.</p><p>I have chosen a third category. Just as Krishnamurti is alone on the
extreme left, I am alone in the middle. And Krishnamurti is reacting
against the tradition. I am not reacting, I am simply acting out of
understanding. I can see where the old pattern went wrong. I will not do
just the opposite because just the opposite will also go wrong. I am
doing something exactly in the middle.</p><p>So I don't deny your discipleship. I don't deny it because I respect
you. I love you. I cannot say I am not a master because I know, I have
experienced, I can share it with you.</p><p>Then it is up to you to say yes or no.</p><p>Maneesha is right. So as a footnote remember her, that no will bring
its own consequences. It is not that I will punish you, your no will
punish you itself. Yes will bring its own rewards. It is not that I will
reward you; yes brings its own rewards.</p><p>Between me and you there is no relationship other than of love. But
it is good that Maneesha has raised the question; otherwise, there was a
possibility that many may have misunderstood.</p><p>The concerned doctor is trying to convince the patient that he is
overweight. "Now just step on the scales," says the doctor. "There...
you see? Now look at this chart and compare your weight with the average
weight for your height. You are way overweight."</p><p>"No, I am not," says the patient. "I am just six inches too
short."</p><p>It is a very difficult world -- misunderstanding is possible
everywhere.</p><p>The matronly woman was alone in the house watching her favorite
television program when her husband burst through the front door,
stalked into the bedroom without saying a word, and began packing his
suitcase.</p><p>"Where are you going?" she demanded.</p><p>"I resigned from the firm today. I'm sick and tired of you, and I'm
going to Australia. I'm told that the young ladies there will gladly pay
five dollars a night for the services of a good man, and I intend to
live off the earnings from my lovemaking."</p><p>He then continued to pack. Suddenly his wife pulled her suitcase from
the closet and began packing her own clothing. "And where do you think
you are going?" he demanded.</p><p>"To Australia," she laughed. "I want to see how you are going to live
on ten dollars a month."</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHENEVER ANY EMOTIONS GET TRIGGERED, MY ATTEMPTS AT</p><p>WATCHING USUALLY RESULT IN MIND TRIPS, UNLESS I DO SOMETHING</p><p>LIKE RUN AROUND BUDDHA HALL A COUPLE OF TIMES FIRST.</p><p>I FEEL THAT IF I COULD TURN ALL THIS ENERGY IN, INSTEAD OF OUT, GREAT
THINGS COULD HAPPEN.</p><p>WHILE YOU TALK TO US ABOUT WATCHING, IT FEELS SO SIMPLE. AND</p><p>BASKING IN YOUR SILENCE, I WONDER HOW IT CAN BE A PROBLEM. BELOVED
MASTER, WHAT AM I MISSING, OR AM I TOO IMPATIENT?</p><p>Prashanto, the first thing is to remember that the exact purpose of
Buddha Hall is what you are doing.</p><p>Go on running as long as you don't fall down. Fall down on the ground
not by any effort, but just let it happen by running continuously. The
time will come when you will fall down. Then rest there and you will
find immense peace and great silence which you have never known.</p><p>This is exactly the purpose of Dynamic Meditation: to exhaust your
energy, so the mind has no more supply of energy to create thoughts and
dreams and imaginations. So you are using the Buddha Hall perfectly
correctly for the first time, knowing that that is the purpose of
it.</p><p>I have never told anybody, because then from tomorrow you will see
there will be two big crowds running.</p><p>Exhaust the outgoing energy and suddenly you will find you are in. To
go in, you don't need any energy, you are there. The outgoing energy has
to be exhausted, so you cannot go out. As far as going in is concerned
that is a wrong idea; nobody goes in. How can you go in? That's where
you are! You can go out -- that's okay.</p><p>So go to Buddha Hall and run as much as you can. Don't stop in the
middle</p><p>thinking that it is too tiring. Go on, go on, let the body according
to its own wisdom fall down. Don't act, don't try to deceive, because
you are deceiving yourself. And if you can allow the body to go on
running till it falls, then lie down there on the ground, and you would
be surprised that you have never known such peace, such silence, such
deep meditation.</p><p>Gautam Buddha himself... If you go to Bodhgaya where he became
enlightened -</p><p>- that's why the name of the city has become Bodhgaya. Gaya must have
been the name of the town but when Gautam Buddha became enlightened,
bodh means enlightenment, so the city of Gaya became Bodhgaya. There is
a temple in his memory made almost two thousand years ago and there is
the tree under which he used to sit.</p><p>If you go to Bodhgaya you will still find what I have described to
you by the side of the temple and nearly two hundred stones in a line.
For one hour Gautam Buddha used to sit and meditate, and for one hour he
used to walk on those stones and meditate. When he became tired of
walking he would sit; when he became tired of sitting he would walk.</p><p>This way he exhausted his outgoing energy.</p><p>One day he found there is no energy at all for any outgoing. He
remained in. And this remaining in revealed to him his luminous being,
his ultimate consciousness.</p><p>In language it is a problem; we say, go in. You cannot go in, because
if you go in, then that "in" will also be out. You can only go out; you
cannot go in.</p><p>In, you are. What do you mean by "in"? It is not the inside of your
house; it is where you are. There you don't need going, all that you
need is that you don't have any energy to go out, so naturally you
remain still and silent and in. Suddenly there is an explosion of light
and bliss and ecstasy.</p><p>So you have found a beautiful meditation, Prashanto. Continue, and
you will find many more from tomorrow on the way. Don't chitchat with
anybody. The moment you enter the path by the side of Buddha Hall forget
that anybody else exists in the world: you and the road, till you fall
down. Then in a day you can achieve something which you may not be able
to achieve in one year's Dynamic Meditation. This is the ultimate
dynamic meditation!</p><p>I have not told people but you have found it, so now I have to
recognize it.</p><p>Just remember one thing, that you are not to stop by yourself.
Because if you stop you will miss the point, you will always stop before
the energy is finished. That's why I'm saying go on and on and on till
you cannot go on, and you fall. Don't pretend to fall, because those are
all deceptions that you can detect yourself. You know perfectly well
when you are pretending to fall and when you are really falling.</p><p>So don't misunderstand me. The real thing will happen only when
automatically you find yourself falling. You are just a watcher, not a
doer. And a tremendous experience is possible.</p><p>The father was having a heart-to-heart talk with his son before the
boy's marriage.</p><p>"Son," he said, "I have two bits of advice for you before you get
married. First, you must tell your wife, right from the start, that you
insist on spending one night each week out with the boys."</p><p>"And what," asked the son, "is the second bit of advice?" His father
smiled and said, "Don't waste it on the boys."</p><p>Hymie Goldberg goes for his weekly visit to the doctor and says,
"Doc, I snore so loudly that I keep myself awake. What can I do?"</p><p>The doctor rolls his eyes and says, "Why don't you try sleeping in
another room?"</p><p>So Prashanto, just get exactly what I am saying.</p><p>A Jew and an Irishman were fishing in separate boats some distance
apart. The Irishman got a bite and was so nervous that he fell out of
the boat. He sank twice, and as he was coming up the second time, the
Jew rowed over and called out: "Mister, can I have your boat if you
don't come up again?"</p><p>People have their own understanding. Just get exactly what I have
told you, and when something happens report to me, because everybody
will be waiting, "What happened to Prashanto?" And tomorrow everybody
will be watching! I</p><p>have made you a hero within a second. Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Osho. The Invitation Chapter #20</p><p>Chapter title: Those third rate politicians, those dwellers of the
gutter 31 August 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium</p><p>Archive code: 8708310</p><p>ShortTitle: INVITA20</p><p>Audio:</p><p>Yes Video:</p><p>Yes Length:</p><p>89</p><p>mins Question 1</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IN CANADA, WHERE I LIVE, I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN</p><p>NATIONAL POLITICS. SHOULD I REFRAIN, GIVEN THE STATE OF POLITICS</p><p>IN THE WEST, OR SHOULD I ACCEPT AND USE THE EXPERIENCE AS ANOTHER
DIMENSION OF MY PROCESS?</p><p>Rupananda, it is well known what I think about politics, but I will
not say anything to you, this way or that.</p><p>My whole approach to my people is that of freedom. You have to act
out of your own intelligence. You don't have to depend on my advice.</p><p>I go on giving you my experiences, my attitudes, but there is no
compulsion that you have to follow them. You are not my followers, you
are my friends.</p><p>I cannot impose my ideas on someone I love; I give you absolute
freedom to do whatsoever your intelligence, your meditativeness allows
you. And I don't think you will go wrong.</p><p>Just don't be attracted by ambition, don't be attracted by power,
because those infatuations are destructive. And the people who become
attracted by things like money, power, prestige, miss one thing: that is
life.</p><p>Balzar has a law about it: Life is what happens to you while you are
making other plans.</p><p>A politician has no life, he is always making other plans, and
meanwhile life goes on slipping by. But still, it is going to be your
choice.</p><p>I never want to be remembered by you as someone who forced,
manipulated, dominated you according to his ideas. I can share
everything with you, but the final decision has to be yours, because
that's how one matures. If you feel like going into politics, just think
what you can contribute, or you will also become part of the whole dirty
game that goes on in the name of politics.</p><p>You are asking me, "Should I get into the gutter?" I will not prevent
you. If you enjoy it is perfectly okay with me! But always remember,
don't take part in</p><p>anything unless you are ready so that you can improve it, you can
give it some refinement -- not only about action, but also about talk.
Cogglin's Law is: Don't talk unless you can improve the silence. It is a
tremendously beautiful statement: Don't talk unless you can improve the
silence -- very insightful.</p><p>Don't go into politics unless you can improve humanity and you can
improve people's humbleness... not getting into a competitive will to
power, because that kind of thing happens only when you are feeling
empty inside. I have never heard of any politician becoming enlightened
-- that will be a contradiction in terms -- nor vice versa, have I ever
heard of any enlightened man being a politician.</p><p>You think you will be exploring a new dimension through the gutter?
Through the gutter you will get into a deeper gutter, a bigger gutter,
the main gutter. It is not a dimension; it is simply falling from your
intelligence, it is not maturity. A certain retardedness is absolutely
necessary in politics. If you feel you qualify...! You have to be
continuously lying, you have to be promising things which you know
perfectly well you cannot deliver.</p><p>Just the other night I was reading about a rabbi who wrote a letter
to a friend, but a very strange letter. He wrote a small paragraph and
then left almost the whole page, and signed underneath. That is not the
way people write a letter. When you write a letter, you sign underneath
it... this much gap. The man was also puzzled when he received the
letter. He inquired of him, "What is the reason for leaving such a big
gap between the letter and the signature?"</p><p>He said, "It says in the scriptures, `Keep yourself as far away from
lies as possible.'"</p><p>But still, if you like there is no problem; there are many sannyasins
in the same gutter in different countries. A certain cruelty,
inhumanity, cunningness are the basic requirements for you to become a
politician. So I am worried whether you have all these prerequisite
conditions. Innocence is of no use; that will bring failure. Silence is
of no use, truthfulness is of no use, to be sharply intelligent is no
use. And remember one thing: politics gives you power, but it gives you
power by making you a beggar. All politicians are beggars, whether they
may be presidents or prime ministers.</p><p>Every five years, and they are standing on your door with their
begging bowl.</p><p>They are, in fact, servants of the people. At least they have to
pretend after each five years. For five years they can believe they are
masters, but they cannot befool anybody of intelligence.</p><p>And this reminds me that the people from whom you are going to beg
for votes are ignorant, prejudiced, are not contemporaries. They belong
to past centuries, many centuries back; they are superstitious. If you
want to have their votes, you have to fall to their standard; they are
not going to rise to your standard.</p><p>To be a politician is a tragedy. But still, if you want to make your
life a tragedy I have no objection. The whole politics around the world
misses anything significant for the future.</p><p>It is too much concerned with trivia, small, ugly conflicts. It is
not interested in reality to improve the destiny of humanity, to give
new dreams to people, to bring more poetry into their lives. On the
contrary, it destroys their dreams, it destroys their hopes; it destroys
their trust in other human beings, because they have been continuously
cheated by the politicians, exploited.</p><p>Oscar Wilde has said, "A map of the world that does not include
utopia is not worth glancing at." But no politician can remain
successfully in politics with a utopian mind; he has to be practical,
pragmatic. He has to forget fundamental things, that through wrong means
you can never reach the right end. Only the right means justify the
rightness of your ends. But no politician can manage to follow right
means towards right ends. He may talk about right ends, right values,
but all his means will be wrong, and through wrong means you never reach
to right ends; they don't connect.</p><p>You have to be mean. You have to be destructive. If needed, you have
to commit all kinds of crime. If you can do all these things, only then
you can become a politician. It is an absolutely foolish and absurd
game, and particularly for a sannyasin who is searching for higher
values, who is looking for inner reality -- who is thinking of beauty,
truth, good. Politics is just the opposite. A sannyasin is trying to
find his authentic being, and the politician has to create a false
personality according to what people need.</p><p>A politician has to say things which he does not mean but which
satisfy people. He can never speak his mind; in fact, people who have
gone deep in understanding the psychology of politics, say in politics
mind is not needed at</p><p>all. We don't see any politician functioning in a way that shows his
genius. There have been millions of geniuses, nobody was attracted
towards politics, only very mediocre people. In a way they represent the
unintelligent, unevolved masses. They are the representatives of the
slaves.</p><p>I have heard...</p><p>A great politician's brain surgery was being done. When the surgeons
opened his brain they saw so much rubbish and garbage that they thought
it is better to take the whole mind out of the skull and clean it; they
have never seen anything so dirty. So they left the politician in
anesthesia, so he was not aware, and they went into another room.</p><p>Meanwhile, the politician came out of anesthesia, was resting on the
bed, when a man came rushing and shouted, "What are you doing here? You
have been chosen as the president."</p><p>He said, "My God! What am I doing here?" -- and got up.</p><p>The surgeons looked from the other room, and said, "Hey! Where are
you going? Your brain is here; we are cleaning it!"</p><p>The man said, "Now I don't need it! Clean it well and keep it. When I
am no longer the president of the country I may need it, but right now
there is no problem."</p><p>What use is a mind to the president?</p><p>Presidents are chosen who have no minds of their own, so they can
simply function as rubber stamps.</p><p>Politics is a strange world, but if you want to have some taste of
the ugliest part of human beings, you can go into politics. Just
remember one thing: going in is easy, getting out will be very
difficult, almost impossible. It is getting into deep imprisonment by
your own desires. But there are people who are jailbirds; they like
prison. I have known many politicians; I have not seen anything
worthwhile in their lives. They have staked everything just to be in
power. And what will these people do with power? They will create more
wars, they will create more weapons, they will create more possibilities
for a global suicide.</p><p>These are my ideas about politics, but these are my ideas, you don't
have to follow them.</p><p>If you are feeling a certain urge for power, go into it. Of course I
cannot bless you. I will feel sad and sorry for your going in a wrong
direction, but I cannot prevent you either, because any interference in
your life is against my whole approach. So please, meditate over it.</p><p>Go around Buddha Hall; you will find Prashanto there, either
enlightened or dead! That is far better than going into politics.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I HAVE BEEN IN SOME LONG RELATIONSHIPS FOR MANY YEARS. WHEN I HEAR
YOU TALKING ABOUT JEALOUSY AND FIGHTING AND ALL THESE</p><p>PASSIONATE THINGS IN RELATIONSHIPS, I BECOME REALLY SHAKY, BECAUSE IT
SEEMS I NEVER EXPERIENCE THESE THINGS REALLY</p><p>STRONGLY. LAST NIGHT I GOT VERY SAD ABOUT IT, AND THE QUESTION</p><p>CAME UP WHETHER I EVER REALLY LOVED SOMEBODY, WHETHER I REALLY DID
LET GO AND LOSE CONTROL.</p><p>BELOVED MASTER, DO LOVE AND HATE, FIGHTING AND HARMONY, COOLNESS AND
PASSION REALLY ALWAYS BELONG TOGETHER?</p><p>Anand Vimlan, there are always exceptions. My feeling about you is
that you are being sad unnecessarily. Life allows exceptions: very
rarely you will find a couple who is not in a love-hate relationship but
simply in love. Naturally, this kind of love will have a certain
coolness about it, it cannot be hot.</p><p>To make it hot, you have to bring the opposite in; then fighting and
quarreling and arguing gives a certain excitement to your energies. And
when tired of fighting and arguing, you again move -- the pendulum goes
on moving between love and hate. When your pendulum moves towards love,
you feel strong love</p><p>because of the contrast. It depends on your likings: people like
hotdogs! Dogs are enough, but they want hot dogs!</p><p>Your love is of a silent type, peaceful. There are rivers which are
mountainous, falling from mountains as waterfalls into the valleys;
there is much going on. And there are rivers which flow in the valleys
silently, so silent that you cannot see that they are flowing. But I
don't think that you have to be sad about it; it is a higher quality of
love which is cool, without any excitement, without any heat.</p><p>Don't you love ice cream... a cool breeze, a silent house; no pillow
fighting, no plates being broken? I know it brings a little spice in
life when pillows are going like missiles in the air, but that kind of
spice...? That kind of excitement is stupid.</p><p>A love that can be cool, and without a hot passion, is a higher
quality. Every love should become of that quality.</p><p>An ancient seer of this country has made a very strange statement.
For centuries in this part of the world, when people get married they go
to some master, to some wise man to have his blessings; that is
conventional. That is more important than the marriage done by the
priest. The blessings of a wise man or an enlightened man, if you can
find one, will not be just words. He will shower you with all his love,
with all his grace, with all his flowers of silence and peace.</p><p>One of the ancient seers of the UPANISHADS has a very strange
blessing for couples who come to him: "I bless you, that you will have
ten children, and finally the husband will become your eleventh child."
It looks absurd -- what kind of blessing is this? But I feel that the
man had a great insight.</p><p>The growth of love should finally be so cool, so passionless that the
husband becomes almost a child to the wife, because a woman is
intrinsically a mother. In real love, the woman functions as a mother,
even to the husband. How they can hate? But it rarely happens, and as
the world has gone farther and farther away from their own selves and
silence and peace and coolness, their life as husband and wife has also
gone in the same way.</p><p>So when I am talking, I am talking not about the exceptions -- now,
people like you are exceptions -- I am talking about the general rule.
But it is good that you ask the question; it makes my answer complete. I
have talked about the majority; now, I am talking about a very small
minority in the world -- they are the true</p><p>lovers. Their love knows no friction, but only deep understanding of
each other. So don't be worried about what I have been saying about the
majority, about the world at large. You don't have to follow; you are
perfectly going right.</p><p>Bennett's Accidental Discovery says: First, most auto accidents are
caused by people with driver's licenses, so I tore up my license.
Secondly, according to the latest statistics, most auto accidents happen
within eight miles of your own home, so I moved.</p><p>Don't be stupid about these statistics, and about these accidents.
Just watch your own inner feeling. If you are feeling happy with your
cool and silent, without- any-conflict love, you need not start being
childish, immature. You don't have to follow others.</p><p>The people who are fighting with their spouses are really very
repressed people; their repression is great. All the religions and all
the cultures and all the educational institutions are repressing people,
teaching them to repress sex. Repressed sex is very poisonous, because
then it will not be satisfied with one woman or with one man. That is
really the cause of fight, the cause of all jealousies, the cause of
making spouses into KGB agents. They are watching each move of the other
person.</p><p>The husband cannot even look at a beautiful woman passing by if the
wife is with him, because even looking at her is going to cause immense
trouble at home. It is strange. If you love your wife and your wife
loves you, and you see a beautiful flower or a beautiful face or a
beautiful moon, there is no difference. But because of repressedness,
the wife knows the husband would like to have as many women as possible;
she has to be on guard. And because the husband knows his repression, he
is aware that wife is also repressed in the same way.</p><p>I have heard about a big computer they have invented in New York
which answers your questions. A boy went and asked, "Can you tell me
where my father is?"</p><p>And the computer said, "Your father has gone fishing."</p><p>The boy laughed. He said, "This is absolutely wrong. My father has
been dead for three years."</p><p>The computer laughed and said, "My son, that was the husband of your
mother who died three years ago. Your father has gone fishing!"</p><p>But this goes on happening because for thousands of years so much
sexuality is repressed that it is not possible to be satisfied with one
woman, with one man. There is no basic difference, and the moment you
put the light off any woman is the same, any man is the same. Small
details may be different, but the repressed desire is discontented. A
humanity without any sexual repression will not have this kind of
relationship which is continuously nagging, fighting, harassing each</p><p>other.</p><p>This is the greatest psychological problem facing humanity: how to
get rid of the repression that religions have planted in everybody's
unconscious. It has gone so deep in the bones, in the blood, in the
marrow, that one existentialist philosopher has said, "I would like to
make love to all the women of the earth; still, I cannot say I would be
satisfied." He is saying something true, sincerely true. And he is
saying something not only about himself, he is saying it about all human
beings, men and women both.</p><p>But this is madness. You don't say, "I will not feel satisfied unless
I have eaten apples from every tree of the world." That kind of
statement will not be relevant at all. But the existentialist
philosopher's statement has a relevance; he is saying something true.
That does not mean that he does not love, but his love is not capable to
remove the deep-rooted, repressed sexuality; it is not enough. He wants
more, and he wants change.</p><p>These are the reasons of conflict. You are fortunate if your life has
been moving like a silent river without any unnecessary conflict,
friction; otherwise there are everyday scenes, and this continues all
your life.</p><p>I have heard that ninety-year-old Herbie, who tried to seduce a
fifteen-year-old girl was arrested for assault with a dead weapon!</p><p>It is saddening. Ninety years old and you are not beyond sex, you are
not beyond childish things; it is because of repression.</p><p>Man has to be completely released from all kinds of inhibitions and
repressions, and love will become a very silent and cool affair.</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>PASSING THROUGH THE GATE OF THIS MANDIR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN</p><p>EIGHT YEARS, I FELT A KIND OF FRAGRANCE WHICH HAS STAYED WITH</p><p>ME EVER SINCE. IS IT POSSIBLE TO TAKE THIS FRAGRANCE WITH ME</p><p>WHEN I LEAVE?</p><p>OH, BELOVED MASTER, IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL, AND I AM SO GRATEFUL TO</p><p>SPEND THIS TIME WITH YOU, EVEN IF I CANNOT TAKE THIS FRAGRANCE</p><p>WITH ME.</p><p>Prem Maharaj, the fragrance that you have felt in this temple of
seekers is not something that you can leave behind. This fragrance
contains love, meditativeness, silence, trust, life-affirmative values,
a song of gratitude, a dance with the trees and with the stars...</p><p>This fragrance is an experience of a totally new atmosphere that does
not exist in the outside world. If you meditate, you will become the
same temple. Then, wherever you go the fragrance will go with you like a
shadow; even others will feel it.</p><p>It is not the first time that such a question has come to me. The
moment they enter the gate many people have felt suddenly, as if they
are entering into another world -- the air is different, the vibe is
different -- as if they have come home. And there is bound to be a
certain fragrance, because so many people are meditating, and slowly,
slowly their inner-being flowers are opening. The whole purpose of all
these people to be here is absolutely different from any gathering
anywhere outside in the world.</p><p>These are the people who are in search of the essential, existential
life source. They are at different stages of evolution in consciousness,
but they are all radiating something of higher stages. So when you enter
the temple, you will find the air is different, the trees are different,
the people are different. And if you also become a meditator, as I know
you are becoming, this fragrance will start coming from within your own
being. Even others may feel it wherever you go.</p><p>I want my sannyasins... I have taken away the clothes which made them
distinct;</p><p>I have taken away their malas. But still people feel that they look a
little different from others; still the airport officers catch hold of
them! In Indian embassies when they go for a tourist visa, they
immediately get the idea that they are going to Poona; Poona has become
synonymous with my name. And many sannyasins have wondered -- they are
not wearing the orange, they are not wearing the mala</p><p>-- how they have become suddenly suspicious?</p><p>A sannyasin will have a certain fragrance, a certain style, a certain
way which is subtle; it may not be very apparent to the eyes, but it can
be detected.</p><p>I would like you to be known as separate from the crowds, not by your
clothes not by anything outer, but just by your very being -- your
silence, your peace, your love, your eyes.</p><p>Every gesture of you should declare that you are a sannyasin.</p><p>One day the pope gets a phone call from God. God says to him, "Since
you have been such a good pope, I wanted you to be the first to
know."</p><p>"The first to know what?" asks the pope.</p><p>God says, "I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is
that from now on, the world will have only one religion."</p><p>"That's wonderful," says the pope. "Now everyone will be at peace,
and everyone will get along with one another -- that's great. But what
is the bad news?"</p><p>"In a few days," says God, "you will be receiving a phone call from
Ma Anando in Poona!"</p><p>That one religiousness is not going to be Catholic or Christian. That
one religiousness is going to be this fragrance, Prem Maharaj, that you
have been feeling here. Once our people are ready, they will go on
spreading it all over the world; it needs it tremendously.</p><p>Just remember one thing: Never be miserly. Share your experiences
here with me your silences of the heart, your flowering of the being. Go
on sharing the song that you have heard here, that music that is all
around you.</p><p>Sometimes I feel sad for a few people. One old sannyasin, Kabir,
wrote a letter to me, saying "Osho, I want to share what has happened to
me in all these years living with you.</p><p>But can I talk about you without mentioning your name?" This
cowardliness should be dropped.</p><p>I want you not to be sheep, but lions.</p><p>I want you to roar about the experience, because the world is so deaf
that unless you roar they won't pay any attention. And the moment you
mention my name, even if they are dead, they will wake up! Without my
name, they will feel goody-goody, and you will feel very goody-goody.
But only with my name, will you be able to judge whether those people
have any intelligence, any awareness, any understanding, or whether they
are just mediocre people with prejudiced minds.</p><p>Share without being miserable, without being miserly, and share with
authority. You have nothing to lose.</p><p>It is a tremendous challenge to change this whole earth into a
paradise, but you will not be able to do that if you are cowardly or
miserly. There are many sannyasins who remain silent and don't share
just out of the fear that they may be condemned: "You have also fallen
from the traditional religion, from the convention," they simply remain
quiet.</p><p>That's not right; that is not compassionate. That is cruel. If you
know something, share it for two reasons, because the humanity needs it,
and the second reason is that the more you share, the more you will have
of it.</p><p>MacTavish, O'Rourke and Hymie Goldberg were mourning the loss of a
mutual friend.</p><p>MacTavish said, "As you well know, my friends, I am a thrifty
Scottish soul. But there is a legend in my family that if one places a
wee bit of money in the casket so that it may be buried with the body,
it will ease the way into the next world. For the sake of our friend, I
will place ten dollars in the casket with him." And with a flourish, he
released a ten dollar bill and let it flutter onto the dear departed's
breast.</p><p>O'Rourke had no intention of being outdone. "Well," he said, "this
strikes me as near superstition, but I will also contribute that sum."
And a second ten dollar bill joined the first on the dead man's
breast.</p><p>Goldberg said at once, "Do you think I won't join in this kind deed?"
And whipping out his check book, he quickly made out a check for thirty
dollars, placed it on the dead man's breast and took the two ten dollar
bills as change!</p><p>Don't be that miserly. Share with your full heart, because it is not
only for the benefit of the other, it is also for the benefit of your
own being. The more you share, the more open you will become. Your
sharing is not a loss. In the ordinary world of economics, if you give
things to people, you lose them.</p><p>I have heard...</p><p>A man stopped his car by the side of a beggar. He was in a good mood;
he had won a lottery. He was surprised by the beggar, because his
clothes were very costly, although very old and dirty and rotten, and
his face also looked cultured, educated. But life had been hard -- it
seems he belonged to a very good family, and some calamity had happened.
He stopped his car; he was in a good mood, took out a ten rupee note and
gave it to the beggar, and the beggar laughed.</p><p>The man said, "Why are you laughing?"</p><p>The beggar said, "I am laughing because this is the way I finished
all my money, my whole heritage that my father has left. I also used to
have a beautiful car, but I was giving to everybody -- whoever needed. I
laughed, because if this is the way you are also going, soon you will be
standing by my side."</p><p>In ordinary economics, when you give things you lose. But in the
spiritual world laws change. There, if you DON'T give you lose: if you
keep your doors and windows closed, your blissfulness, your silence, all
become stale. But if you go on sharing, fresh waters will be coming from
the eternal sources of life, and your blissfulness will remain always
fresh and fragrant. And it will go on growing wider and wider.</p><p>As far as I am concerned this is the only real charity, to share your
innermost treasure with people, familiar or strangers, and to turn their
eyes also inwards. Because seeing your treasure, they will be reminded
of their own treasures. Experiencing your fragrance, you will be putting
them on the search of how they</p><p>can also be so fresh, so fragrant, so graceful. From where can they
get this beauty that does not belong to the world, this music without
instruments, and this poetic atmosphere without words?</p><p>Sharing with people is putting them on the right way: in search. And
if they know what happens to the real seeker, they will not go on any
wrong path.</p><p>The Indian constitution says three things are charitable: giving to
the poor, making hospitals for the sick, opening schools for the
uneducated. It is a shame that this should be the only kind of charity
mentioned in the constitution of a country which knows far higher realms
of charity. The constitution was written by people who had no idea --
they were politicians. They could not conceive that there can be some
higher charity.</p><p>To me these are good but not great. The constitution would have been
far richer if it had mentioned sharing your spiritual experiences with
those who are poor in spiritual experiences.</p><p>I have been fighting for years with the Indian government. They are
not ready to believe that this institution is a charitable institution,
and they cannot understand that there are deeper treasures, higher
consciousnesses, and those who don't have them -- they are poor.</p><p>Sharing your spirituality, sharing your meditation, sharing your love
at least should have been mentioned in the constitution, particularly of
a country which has been for centuries the land which has attracted
seekers from all over the world. But this constitution was not written
by seers or enlightened people, but by those third-rate politicians,
those dwellers of the gutter. They cannot see anything more than the
fragrance they feel in the gutter; that is the only fragrance they know
of.</p><p>I would like you not to be bothered by constitutions and other
things. You have to understand the higher economics: share so that you
can have more.</p><p>Okay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.</p><p>The Invitation</p><p>Chapter #21</p><p>Chapter title: To know oneself and to be oneself 31 August 1987 pm in
Chuang Tzu Auditorium Archive</p><p>code:</p><p>8708315</p><p>ShortTitle:</p><p>INVITA21</p><p>Audio:</p><p>Yes Video:</p><p>Yes Length:</p><p>87</p><p>mins Question 1</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>CAN YOU PLEASE SPEAK ON DISCIPLINE AND MEDITATION?</p><p>Niten, it is a very strange question because every day, morning and
evening, I am speaking on discipline and meditation. If anybody reads
your question, he will think that for the first time I have to speak on
discipline and meditation! Where have you been for so long?</p><p>You remind me of two old friends; they meet on a street in
Leningrad... "How is life treating you," asks one.</p><p>"Just great," replies the other.</p><p>The first one looks at him dubiously and says, "Have you been reading
the papers?"</p><p>"Of course," replies the other, "how else would I know!"</p><p>People know about their own lives by reading newspapers, and I have
been telling you every day about meditation and nothing else, and you
are asking...!</p><p>Okay...</p><p>A little old Jewish lady sits down on a plane next to a big
Norwegian. She keeps staring and staring at him. Finally she turns to
him and says, "Pardon me, are you Jewish?"</p><p>"No," he replies. A few minutes go by and she looks at him again and
says, "You can tell me -- you are Jewish, aren't you?"</p><p>He answers, "Definitely not."</p><p>She keeps studying him, and says again, "I can tell you are
Jewish!"</p><p>In order to get her to stop annoying him, the gentleman says, "Okay,
I am Jewish."</p><p>She looks at him and shakes her head back and forth and says,
"Really, you don't look it!"</p><p>I am wondering from where to begin! Niten, meditation is the only
contribution the East has made to humanity. The West has made many
contributions, thousands of scientific inventions, immense progress in
medicine, unbelievable discoveries in all the dimensions in life. But
still, a single contribution of the East is far more valuable than all
the contributions of the West.</p><p>The West has become rich; it has all the technology to be rich. The
East has</p><p>become poor, immensely poor, because it has not looked for anything
else except for one thing, and that is one's own inner being. Its
richness is something which cannot be seen, but it has known the highest
peaks of bliss, the greatest depths of silence. It has known the
eternity of life; it has known the most beautiful flowering of love,
compassion, joy. Its whole genius has been devoted to a single search --
you can call it ecstasy.</p><p>Meditation is only a technique to reach to the ecstatic state, to the
state of divine intoxication. It is a simple technique, but the mind
makes it very complex. Mind has to make it very complex and difficult,
because both cannot exist together.</p><p>Meditation is the death of the mind.</p><p>Naturally, mind resists every effort for meditation. And if you go on
without listening to the mind... It is clever and cunning enough to give
you false directions and call them meditation.</p><p>Just today I was informed about one of the people who has been for
many years a disciple of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. He is now here
meditating, but he continues his master Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's
meditation too.</p><p>What Maharishi Mahesh Yogi calls transcendental meditation is neither
transcendental nor meditation. It is a mind trick. Just one thing is
missing in it -- I have been telling you about the monkey -- and the
person who is here should remember it! Transcendental meditation works
only if you don't remember the monkey. So from tomorrow morning, be
careful! The slightest remembrance of the monkey, and transcendental
meditation is meaningless.</p><p>In fact, after eighteen years being with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and
doing his transcendental meditation, what is the need to come here? But
mind is so cunning that he is consoling himself that perhaps it is his
master, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who has sent him here. But why should he
send you here? I don't consider that he knows anything at all about
meditation. What Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is teaching in the name of
meditation has been known for centuries in the East by almost everybody
that it is a psychological trick. It is not harmful. On the contrary, it
can give you a little rest; it can give you a good feeling as if you
have taken a shower. But it is not meditation, because it cannot take
you beyond the mind.</p><p>Any effort made by the mind cannot take you beyond the mind. This is
a very</p><p>fundamental rule to remember. The so-called transcendental meditation
is just an example. There are many of the same kind prevalent all over
the East, but they don't bring enlightenment. They don't bring awakened
consciousness and that is the only criterion to decide whether they are
right or not. A tree is known by its fruits, and a technique is known by
what it achieves.</p><p>Transcendental meditation is representative of all the meditations
which mind has suggested to you; it is a cunning way to take you astray.
Mind remains safe, not only safe, but becomes stronger. All these
techniques are of concentration. You concentrate on some word, holy word
-- the name of God, or any mantra -- and you repeat it as fast as you
can, just inside your mind. The faster you can do it the better; the
speed helps two things. The mantra or the name of God -- even your own
name will do; it has nothing to do with God -- any meaningless word will
do because the technique depends on something else. It depends on fast
repetition, so fast that there are no gaps left in between.</p><p>Because there are no gaps, thoughts cannot arise; thoughts need a
little space.</p><p>This is one thing: that you go on repeating a word faster and faster,
and as you go on doing it for years, you really become an expert. So one
thing it does is that it does not give a chance for any idea to enter
into your mind. The second, more fundamental thing it does is that it
creates tremendous boredom. Obviously, anything continuously repeated is
going to create boredom, and boredom is the basis of auto-hypnosis.</p><p>When you become bored, you start falling into a sleep, which is not
exactly sleep because it is deliberately created; hence it has a
different name -- hypnosis. Hypnosis means sleep, with a difference,
that it is deliberate.</p><p>Sleep comes naturally -- on its own, spontaneously. Hypnosis is
deliberate sleep</p><p>-- you create a situation in which it is bound to happen. This
deliberate sleep is immensely healthy, and even ten or fifteen minutes
in a hypnotic state gives you a good relaxation which hours of ordinary
sleep cannot give. And when you come out of it, you will feel very
fresh.</p><p>I absolutely agree that if you are doing it only for this purpose --
relaxation, a freshness comes, but it never takes you beyond the mind.
How can it take you beyond the mind, because mind itself is repeating?
By repetition, it does not need to think; repetition itself becomes a
substitute for thoughts. And by</p><p>repetition it falls into a deep sleep -- dreamless sleep, which gives
you immense freshness, rejuvenation.</p><p>Naturally, you can be deceived that this is meditation -- you can go
on doing it your whole life. It is healthy, it is good, it is
nourishing, but it is not meditation.</p><p>Meditation starts by being separate from the mind, by being a
witness. That is the only way of separating yourself from anything. If
you are looking at the light, naturally one thing is certain, you are
not the light, you are the one who is looking at it. If you are watching
the flowers, one thing is certain, you are not the flower, you are the
watcher.</p><p>Watching is the key of meditation:</p><p>Watch your mind.</p><p>Don't do anything -- no repetition of mantra, no repetition of the
name of God -- just watch whatever the mind is doing. Don't disturb it,
don't prevent it, don't repress it; don't do anything at all on your
part. You just be a watcher, and the miracle of watching is meditation.
As you watch, slowly, slowly mind becomes empty of thoughts; but you are
not falling asleep, you are becoming more alert, more aware.</p><p>As the mind becomes completely empty, your whole energy becomes a
flame of awakening. This flame is the result of meditation. So you can
say meditation is another name of watching, witnessing, observing --
without any judgment, without any evaluation. Just by watching, you
immediately get out of the mind.</p><p>The watcher is never part of the mind and as the watcher becomes more
and more rooted and strong, the distance between the watcher and the
mind goes on becoming longer and longer. Soon the mind is so far away
that you can hardly feel that it exists... just an echo in faraway
valleys. And ultimately, even those echoes disappear. This disappearance
of the mind is without your effort, without your using any force against
the mind -- just letting it die its own death.</p><p>Once mind is absolutely silent, absolutely gone, you cannot find it
anywhere. You become for the first time aware of yourself because the
same energy that was involved in the mind, finding no mind, turns upon
itself. Remember: energy is a constant movement.</p><p>We say things are objects, and perhaps you have never thought why we
call things objects. They are objects because they hinder your energy,
your consciousness. They object; they are obstacles. But when there is
no object, all thoughts, emotions, moods, everything, has disappeared.
You are in utter silence, in nothingness -- rather in nothingness; the
whole energy starts turning upon itself. This returning energy to the
source brings immense delight.</p><p>Just the other day, I quoted William Blake, "energy is delight." That
man, although he is not a mystic, must have found some glimpse of
meditation. When meditation comes back to its own source, it explodes in
immense delight.</p><p>This delight in its ultimate state is enlightenment.</p><p>Anything that helps you to go through this process of meditation is
discipline: perhaps taking a good bath, being clean and cool; sitting in
a relaxed posture with eyes closed, neither hungry nor overloaded;
sitting in a posture which is most relaxing... having a look at the
whole body, every part and whether there is any tension. If there is any
tension, then change the posture and bring the body into a relaxed
state.</p><p>In the East it has been found, and found rightly, that the lotus
posture -- the way you must have seen the statues of Buddha; that is
called the lotus posture... It has been a discovery of thousands of
years that that is the most relaxed state of the body. But for
Westerners who are not accustomed to sitting on the ground, the lotus
posture is a nightmare! So avoid it, because it takes almost six months
to learn the lotus posture; it is not necessary.</p><p>If you are accustomed to sitting on a chair, you can find a way, a
posture, a chair made in a certain way that helps your body to relax all
its tensions. It does not matter whether you are sitting in the chair or
in the lotus posture or lying down on the bed. Sitting is preferable
because it will prevent you from falling asleep.</p><p>The lotus posture was chosen for many reasons. If one can manage it
without torturing himself, then it is the best, but it is not a
necessity. It is certainly the best situation in which you can enter
into watchfulness. The legs are crossed, the hands are crossed, the
spine is straight; it gives many significant supports to being watchful.
First, in this position, gravitation has the least effect on the body
because your spine is straight. So the gravitation can effect a very
small portion. When you are lying down, gravitation effects your whole
body. That's why for</p><p>sleeping, lying down is the best posture. Gravitation pulls the whole
body, and because of its pull, the body loses all tensions. Secondly,
when you are lying down, if the purpose is to sleep then you should use
a pillow because the less blood reaches to your mind, the less the mind
will be active. The less blood reaches to the mind, the more possibility
to fall asleep.</p><p>A lotus posture is a great combination. It has the least effect of
gravitation, and because the spine is straight a lesser amount of blood
reaches to the mind, so mind cannot function. In that posture you cannot
fall asleep easily. And if you have learned the posture from your very
birth, it becomes so natural. The crossing of the legs, the crossing of
the hands have a significance. Your body energy moves in a circle; the
circle is not broken anywhere in a lotus posture. Both your hands... one
hand gives the energy to the other hand; your one foot gives energy to
the other foot -- and the energy goes on moving in a circle. You become
a circle of your bio-energy.</p><p>Many things are of much help. Your energy is not being released so
you don't get tired.</p><p>Your blood is reaching in a lesser amount so the mind does not
function too much. You are sitting in such a position -- your legs are
locked, your hands are locked and your spine is straight -- sleep is
difficult. These are just supports; they are not essential.</p><p>It is not that one who cannot sit in a lotus posture cannot meditate,
meditation will be a little difficult but the lotus posture is only
helpful, not absolutely needed. And for the people from colder countries
where sitting on the ground is not possible -- their bodies for
centuries; their parents and their parents' parents from Adam and Eve...
Have you seen any picture of Adam and Eve sitting in a lotus posture? In
fact, it would have been very good for them, because sitting in lotus
posture they could sit naked and yet nobody would have been very much
aware of their nakedness. That's how the Jaina monks sit, always in
lotus posture. You cannot see their genitals. Their legs are crossed,
their hands are crossed; this functions almost as a protection for their
nakedness.</p><p>But if for centuries people have never sat, then it will
unnecessarily create trouble; your body structure has taken a certain
mode. It is better to follow the body and its wisdom: use a chair. The
whole thing is you should be comfortable so that the body does not draw
your attention. That's why tension has to be</p><p>avoided, because if you have a headache then it will be difficult to
meditate. Again and again, your attention will go to the headache. If
your leg is hurting, or if there is any slight tension anywhere in the
body, it immediately alarms you. It is natural and it is part of the
body's wisdom.</p><p>If it does not alarm you then there is danger: a snake may be biting
you, and you may go on sitting; your clothes may catch fire, your body
may be burning, and you may not be aware of it. So the body immediately
alarms wherever there is any trouble. That's the reason to create a
relaxed position in which the body need not alarm you, because every
alarm will be a disturbance in your meditation.</p><p>So the first thing of discipline is a relaxed body and closed eyes,
because if you have open eyes, then so many things are moving around,
they can be a disturbance. It is perfectly right for the beginners to
use a blindfold, so that you are completely inside, because it is your
eyes, your senses that take you outside. Eyes take eighty percent of all
your outgoing contact -- eighty percent is through the eyes, so close
the eyes.</p><p>For the beginners, it is good if they can use earplugs. Close the
ears so no noise from the outside disturbs you. It is only for the
beginners; all the precautions are for the beginners.</p><p>And then just watch your mind as if the mind is nothing but a traffic
of thoughts or a film</p><p>-- a movie passing on the TV screen. You are just a neutral
observer.</p><p>This is the discipline. And if this discipline is complete, watching
comes very easily, and watching is meditation. Through watchfulness mind
disappears, thoughts disappear. And that moment is the most blessed
moment: when you are fully awake and there is not a single thought, just
a silent sky of your inner being.</p><p>This is the moment when energy turns inwards; the turning-in is
sudden, abrupt. And as the energy turns inwards, it brings immense
delight, orgasmic delight. Suddenly your awareness becomes so rich
because the energy is nourishment to your awareness. The energy coming
back creates almost a flame of your being. You see all around pure
light, silence -- utter silence, and an immense centering.</p><p>You are now at your very center.</p><p>At the right moment, when you are exactly centered -- the explosion.
That explosion, we call enlightenment. This enlightenment brings you all
the treasures of the inner world, the whole splendor. It is the only
miracle in the world: to know oneself and to be oneself, and to know
that one is deathless, one is beyond the body, beyond the mind; one is
just pure consciousness.</p><p>So the discipline is just a support, the essential thing is
witnessing, watching -- that is meditation. But in the name of
meditation, there are hundreds of so-called teachers who go on
exploiting people. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi became well known in the West,
because the West was not aware that in the East, even the villagers are
doing the so-called transcendental meditation. Everybody chanting,
repeating the name of God -- it is an enjoyable exercise. I am not
against it; it is perfectly good, but don't call it meditation and don't
call it transcendental. Those are wrong words for it.</p><p>It is hypnotic auto-suggestion and nothing more. It will never give
you the light that Kabir talks of, "As if thousands of suns have arisen
all around." It will not give you what Rumi calls as if the whole sky is
showering flowers, and the whole being is filled with perfume,
unearthly, not of this world."</p><p>It will not give you the ecstasy that Patanjali, the founder of Yoga,
continuously insists on in his yoga sutras. He says that samadhi,
ecstasy is very similar to sleep with only one difference that it is
alert. If sleep can be awake, if sleep can be full of awareness, then it
is samadhi, it is ecstasy. It will never give you the buddha nature. It
gives you ordinary mental rest -- physical relaxation; hence, I am not
against it.</p><p>Whatever Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and other people like him are doing is
good, but they are calling something meditation which is not. That's
where they are leading people astray. If they had remained sincere and
authentic and told people that this will give you mental health,
physical health, a more relaxed life, a more peaceful existence, it was
right. But once they started calling it transcendental meditation they
have raised a very trivial thing to an ultimate significance which it
cannot fulfill. People have been in transcendental meditation for years,
and in the East, for thousands of years. But that has not become their
self-knowing, and that has not made them Gautam Buddhas.</p><p>If you want to understand exactly what meditation is Gautam Buddha is
the first man to come to its right, exact definition -- that is
witnessing. Learn from</p><p>Gautam Buddha witnessing, and learn from Patanjali the discipline
that can be helpful for meditation. This way, yoga and mediation can
become a synthesis. Yoga is a discipline, just an outer support --
immensely helpful but not absolutely needed. And Gautam Buddha has given
to the world the very fundamental and the most essential thing:
witnessing as meditation.</p><p>Niten, your question will not be solved until you start on the path a
little bit; otherwise, you will ask again, "What is meditation?" Just my
explaining it to you is not enough; you will have to move on the
path.</p><p>Hymie and Becky Goldberg are about to take their first flight on an
airliner. Hymie spends a while enjoying his comfortable, reclining seat
and watching the pretty stewardess walking up and down the aisle. Next
he looks out of the window and says excitedly, "Becky, look at those
people down there, they look like ants."</p><p>Becky leans over, has a look and then says, "They are ants, you
idiot... we haven't left the ground yet!"</p><p>Hymie Goldberg was so interested in watching the pretty girls going
up and down the aisle, he had completely forgotten that the airplane was
still standing -- it had not moved!</p><p>So looking at the ants, he thought they must be people from such a
height. That's why you meditate with closed eyes!</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>HOW YOU TALK ABOUT THE SAME OLD THINGS DAY AFTER DAY AND YET</p><p>PRODUCE A NEW REVELATION WITH EACH SENTENCE IS TO ME THE</p><p>GREATEST MIRACLE IN EXISTENCE. WOULD YOU CARE TO COMMENT, PLEASE?</p><p>Veena, it is very simple. First, because I have nothing to say, so I
am free to say</p><p>anything.</p><p>I don't know what is going to be my next sentence; hence, it is not a
burden or a trouble; it is spontaneous. I am not an orator who has to
practice and rehearse. I love people, and I love to share my experience
with them. I don't remember the past; hence, it is very difficult for me
to repeat it. And because I look more at the questioner than his
question...</p><p>and all questioners are different; their questions may be almost the
same. Looking at the questioner, my answer changes, I respond to the
person. I don't have any doctrine to preach, so I don't have to be
consistent. I enjoy absolute freedom.</p><p>In the past history of mankind, only poets have been given a certain
license that they can use a little bit of freedom not to bother about
the grammar and the language and the rules and the regulations. They had
to be given that much license, otherwise they could not have poetry.
That is the difference between prose and poetry: prose has to follow
rules, regulations, grammar, linguistics; poetry has a certain freedom.
I am even using prose with absolute license, because I don't see there
is any reason to follow any limits.</p><p>All that I know is if what I am feeling is conveyed to you, whether
it is right grammar or wrong grammar, whether it is the right word or
the wrong word, is irrelevant. If I have conveyed my joy, my love, my
peace, my blissfulness to you, any word is right. And because I have so
much overflowing experience of my being I can go on for a millennium
talking about it -- from different aspects, different angles, different
directions; it will remain inexhaustible.</p><p>You have heard speakers, orators; I don't belong to their category. I
simply enjoy gossiping! It is not a gospel -- I am not serious about it.
Seriousness to me is psychologically sick. Healthy people will not enjoy
gospels; they are boring. And you can see in any church you will find
people asleep. The Sunday sermon is a good morning nap; people go to the
church for that good morning nap... no disturbance. And the sermon is
almost the same, it helps sleep.</p><p>I have heard that one great preacher was very much disturbed. He was
a very learned rabbi. His trouble was that an old millionaire, who had
contributed the most to the synagogue, used to sit just in front of him
and sleep and snore loudly. It was not a trouble that he was snoring, it
was a trouble because his snore</p><p>disturbed other sleepers! And his snore kept many other sleepers
awake. That disturbed the preacher because that meant every Sunday you
have to bring a new sermon -- people are awake.</p><p>It is a good agreement between preachers and their congregation, that
the congregation will sleep and the preacher will preach. He can go on
preaching the same thing every time. There is not much to preach either.
In all the four gospels, it is only one story repeated four times, the
same incidents reported by four journalists! And not very educated
either! So what can the poor preachers do? What can the rabbis do?</p><p>I have been looking through the TALMUD, and it is so tiring that
anybody who suffers from sleeplessness, I suggest the TALMUD -- you can
just manage two or three pages! It is so much nonsense, and on that
nonsense rabbis go on interpreting, interpretations upon
interpretations. And the original is basic rubbish. I have always
suspected because the namèrabbi' seems to be so close tòrubbish' that
there must have been some past connection between rubbish and rabbi!</p><p>But somehow the rabbi had to stop that old man -- and he found a way.
He used to come with his grandchildren -- a little boy, sometimes a
little girl -- but he always used to bring a little child with him. The
rabbi one day took the child aside and said, "Listen, my boy, if you can
keep your grandpa awake, particularly when he starts snoring -- you can
nudge him -- I will give you four annas."</p><p>The boy said, "Settled!"</p><p>And the next sermon day it was really great; the boy did not allow
the old man to snore.</p><p>The moment he would snore, the boy would nudge him.</p><p>The old man was amazed, "What has happened?" The boy had never done
such a thing before... always sitting silently. Outside he asked, "What
is the matter?"</p><p>The boy said, "Nothing is the matter. I am getting four annas to keep
you awake, because your snoring is disturbing the whole
congregation."</p><p>"Who is giving you four annas?" the old man asked. "I will give you
eight annas</p><p>if you sit silently and don't disturb my snoring." The boy said,
"That's perfectly good -- agreed!"</p><p>Next time the rabbi looked again and again at the boy, and the boy
started looking downwards, and the old man was snoring. And the rabbi
said, "What is the matter?" He many times made the indication, but the
boy would not look at him at all. He continued to look downward. After
the sermon the rabbi took the boy aside, and said, "You seem to be very
cunning. Have you forgotten?"</p><p>He said, "No, the old man is giving me eight annas not to disturb
him." The rabbi said, "I will give you one rupee."</p><p>He said, "That's perfectly good -- promised."</p><p>Next time he again started nudging the old man. The old man said,
"Have you forgotten?"</p><p>The boy said, "I have not forgotten. Now the rabbi is giving me one
rupee, and business is business!"</p><p>A true Jew!</p><p>I don't know what is going to come through me. I am almost a vehicle,
I have left myself almost completely in the hands of existence. So
whatever existence wants to convey to you, I am available. That's why I
went on stopping many times because it is not in my hands, it is in the
hands of existence. If something goes on flowing, it is okay -- and if
it is nothing, I wait. I wait for existence to pick up the last
thread.</p><p>Veena, you say that it is the greatest miracle in existence. I can
agree with you. I myself feel it, that either I am mad -- because for
thirty years I have been continuously speaking, nonstop... Now I am
speaking much less; otherwise five lectures per day had been my usual
routine from morning till late night. Naturally, I thought either I am
mad or it is a miracle. There are only two possibilities; I am happy
with either!</p><p>A Soviet citizen who was visiting the West was besieged by many
questions from persons wanting to know more about communism.</p><p>"You mean to tell me," asked a curious host, "that by being a
communist, you share everything?"</p><p>"Yes," came the reply.</p><p>"You mean," the host continued, "if you had two houses you would give
me one?"</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>"And if you had two cars, you would give me one?" "Certainly,"
replied the Russian.</p><p>"And if you had two stoves, or televisions, or refrigerators you
would give me one of each?"</p><p>"Naturally," said the Russian.</p><p>"And if," the host went on, "you had two shirts, you would give me
one?" "No," replied the communist emphatically.</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"Because I have two shirts!"</p><p>Veena, I simply enjoy talking, just as I enjoy silence. I have to
keep some balance. Most of the time I am silent, and then naturally, I

you, and then I go to sleep! In the morning I wake up, I talk to you,
and then I go to sleep. My twenty-four hours are divided into two
things: talking and sleeping!</p><p>My sleep is my silence, my ecstasy, my samadhi. My talking is my
sharing with you what I have found in my sleep!</p><p>Okay, Maneesha?

HAND. MY GRATITUDE FEELS SO INADEQUATE FOR YOUR</p><p>GIFT. WHY DO I FEEL SO UNWORTHY OF YOU?</p><p>Veet Vidhan, there are certain symptoms of falling in love. One of
them is a feeling of unworthiness, because love is so vast, and you are
so small. You cannot earn love, it comes on its own accord; suddenly it
starts showering on you.</p><p>Naturally, because you have not earned it, you cannot feel worthy of
it. As love deepens, the feeling of unworthiness deepens. If a person in
love does not feel it, that means the love is superficial, and the man
has too big an ego. Only in that situation -- when your ego is too big,
and your love is a superficial affair, not the great affair Ta Hui was
talking about...</p><p>Before the great affair of love, it is absolutely necessary and
inevitable, that one should feel unworthy. Nothing is wrong in it; it is
exactly as it should be. Out of this unworthiness, slowly, slowly
transformation happens. I can predict it will happen to you too, because
your feeling of unworthiness is not just an intellectual question.
Intellect never asks such questions; ego does not allow such questions;
mind is not capable of asking such questions.</p><p>Mind and ego and intellect -- they all take it for granted whatever
happens in their lives is not enough. They are worthy for more; hence
the question cannot arise from those sources. The only source that
remains is the heart, which is always true and always sincere. And once
the heart starts feeling unworthy, it does not give a sadness to you but
a gratefulness. Slowly, slowly unworthiness turns into gratitude: you
are not worthy of something and it has been showering on you; you cannot
even understand why existence has chosen you.</p><p>One of Gautam Buddha's disciples, Manjushri, became enlightened
sitting under a tree.</p><p>The moment he became enlightened, suddenly flowers from the tree
started showering on him. Those who were around, they could not believe
what is happening. There was not any strong wind. There is no reason why
so many flowers go on showering on Manjushri.</p><p>He was sitting silently with closed eyes; perhaps he was not even
aware.</p><p>They reported to Gautam Buddha. He looked where Manjushri was sitting
under a tree, and he said, "He has become what his destiny was; he has
come to his flowering. And not only is his inner being full of joy, even
the tree is celebrating."</p><p>These kinds of stories for centuries had been taken as metaphors,
poetry, beautiful anecdotes. But now we can say they are factually
possible on scientific grounds. Trees are very sensitive, more sensitive
than you are. They join you in your celebration; they join you in your
mourning. Of course, you are not aware, but now scientists have found
ways to figure it out. They have made a small instrument like a
cardiogram, which is attached to the tree, and the cardiogram starts
working, making the graph of the tree's sensitivity.</p><p>When the tree is at ease, relaxed, the cardiogram makes the graph
very symmetrical. If a woodcutter comes with his axe, with the idea to
cut the tree... He has not started cutting and he has not even said that
he is going to cut the tree, but if he has the idea, the tree is even
sensitive to the idea. And suddenly the graph starts trembling just like
your heart trembles... writing, your hand is trembling. The whole tree
starts trembling deep down, and it can be caught on the graph. The graph
is no longer symmetrical; it goes crazy.</p><p>Not only is it that the tree which has to be cut becomes aware of
your thought, your thought creates a vibration around you which a simple
heart can catch hold of. Other trees surrounding the tree -- friends and
companions which have been together for years, have joined in sadness
when there was no rain, have joined when the rain comes and brings great
joy and blessings. They have passed through many falls and seen
themselves standing naked against the sky, and have seen many springs
together when great foliage comes and when flowers start blossoming. A
certain communion, a certain friendliness has arisen in them.</p><p>So it has been found that the tree which is going to be cut starts
trembling, catches the thought. But other trees nearby also start
trembling... just the idea that one of their old friends is going to be
destroyed. Strangely enough, scientists have been shocked that it means
trees are more sensitive than human beings: you don't know what thought
is going on in the person who is sitting by your side; every mind is
broadcasting its thoughts all around, and you are catching them but you
are not aware.</p><p>They have tried bringing the same woodcutter again, but with no idea
of cutting the tree.</p><p>He comes with his axe, the graph continues exactly the same,
symmetrical, showing that the tree is not worried because there is no
idea in the woodcutter's mind -- and the other trees also stop
trembling. And when the gardener is</p><p>brought who has nourished those trees, cared for them, has loved
them, in lonely moments has even talked with them... I had a gardener,
an old man, a very beautiful man -- and he was not just professionally a
gardener, he loved trees. I have seen him, when there was nobody and he
thought nobody was watching him; I have seen him talk to the trees.</p><p>Once I caught hold of him, because he was continuously winning every
year; almost five years he was with me and every year he was winning the
corporation prize for bringing the biggest roses. I asked him, "What is
the matter; you talk with trees?" He said, "I love them, I feel them. I
can</p><p>tell you, but not anybody else, because I trust you will understand,
that it is not one-sided; they also answer in some way or other. I have
not been winning these prizes because I am a great gardener."</p><p>The city was big, and there were many millionaires in the city. They
had great gardens and many gardeners. And they were all puzzled because
they were all trying to win the prize, but this old man went on
winning.</p><p>He said, "It is just my talking to the trees, saying, `Don't forget
in the right time to give me the biggest flower. It is a question of my
prestige and your prestiges.'" And he said to me, "It has never failed.
Those other gardeners are doing hard work with more manure, more
chemicals. They are doing everything that the art of gardening will
suggest, but this is beyond the art of gardening."</p><p>As the gardener is brought, all the trees feel so immensely happy
that the symmetrical graph becomes almost a dance. Just as it has become
crazy out of fear, so out of love it again becomes not the ordinary
silent tree, but showing a tremendous joy as if the tree is jumping,
dancing. And you can see the difference between the graphs. When the
tree is afraid, the graph will show you that these lines are coming out
of fear. And when the tree has suddenly seen the gardener who has taken
care and grown it like his own children, the graph dances. And you can
see in the graph that it is not out of worry, but out of a gratitude and
out of a welcome -- a friend has come. And other trees also do the
same.</p><p>Man is capable of receiving immense joy if he only learns how to be
grateful. So you are on the right path, Vidhan. But don't go on thinking
in terms that you are unworthy, because that has to be transformed into
gratitude. It is certain, nobody is worthy. What have you done to be
alive? What have you done to have such</p><p>beautiful eyes? What have you done to have this potentiality of
becoming a Gautam Buddha? You have not done anything; it is just coming
out of the abundance of existence. Existence has so much that it has to
share out of sheer necessity to unburden itself; it is overflowing. And
if people remain thirsty, it is their own fault.</p><p>There is an ancient saying in India that you can remain thirsty
standing on the bank of a river. Unless you learn how to bow down, fill
your hands with water, the river is not going to jump towards you. It is
available; just a little humbleness on your part, a little receptivity
on your part, and you can quench your thirst.</p><p>Everything that is great in life is abundantly available; just don't
shrink in your unworthiness. It is a beautiful first step to experience
it, but then for what are we worthy?</p><p>Neither for life, nor for love, nor for this beautiful body -- we are
not worthy for anything; we have just taken all this for granted. This
is the irreligious mind.</p><p>I don't call a man irreligious who does not believe in God. I don't
call a man irreligious who does not go to the temples or churches. I
don't call a man irreligious if he denies heaven and hell and all that
nonsense. But I call a man irreligious if he does not feel unworthy of
all that he has received and is receiving every moment. With every
breath, with every heartbeat life is continuously giving you. The same
life is capable of giving you immense blissfulness, of which you cannot
even have an idea unless you have tasted it.</p><p>Just change your unworthiness into gratefulness, into thankfulness.
And to me, this kind of gratitude is the only true prayer. You don't
have to say anything -- just the feeling of gratefulness that I don't
deserve, I don't see why so much has been given to me and so much goes
on showering on me. What can I do except be grateful?</p><p>This gratefulness should sink deep in your consciousness, in your
very fibers and cells of body. You will simply become gratefulness, then
it is prayer. And the things that are called prayer are just false.
Millions of temples and churches and synagogues, and millions of people
continuously praying... but their prayers are false because they are
always asking for something. They are never thanking for what they have
already received.</p><p>In their prayers if you look, you will find the beggar, the
ungrateful beggar. And</p><p>you will also find in all the prayers of all the religions -- I have
looked as deeply as possible into every religion -- there is a certain
complaint that things are not as they should be: "Others are getting
more; I am not getting that much." These are not prayers, they are
simply wasting their time. They have not even come to understand the
meaning of prayer.</p><p>It is not in the words, it is prayerfulness. And prayerfulness means
only one thing, and only one thing, gratefulness -- a gratitude that
goes on sinking deep into your being for everything: for trees being
green, for rain coming down to quench the thirst of the earth.</p><p>And when the first rains come, the sweet smell coming from the earth
is earth's gratitude.</p><p>And the trees becoming green, and bringing millions of flowers, that
is earth's thankfulness, that is earth's prayer. That's how you should
be; that's how your prayer should be -- nothing but a gratefulness.</p><p>Slowly, slowly man goes on forgetting what complaint is, what grudge
is. As he becomes more attuned with gratefulness, he forgets completely
that he has to ask for something.</p><p>Things are coming without his asking. He has just to keep his doors
open and the guest comes. He has just to wait, and wait lovingly,
prayerfully.</p><p>I am giving you the meaning of prayer in a way no religion has ever
given it to humanity; their prayers are so childish, stupid. A
gratefulness will make you more and more capable of receiving gifts.</p><p>The so-called religions that have overruled man's mind for centuries
are mostly fictions. I have come across Albert Camus' very strange but
beautiful and true statement: "If God did not exist, we would have to
invent him" -- otherwise, to whom are you going to complain? on whose
shoulders are you going to throw all your responsibilities? with whom
are you going to be angry? who is going to be your security,
safety...?</p><p>Camus is saying something very important when he says that if God did
not exist we would have to invent him, and if God did exist, we would
have to abolish him. If God did exist why would we have to abolish him?
-- because it would be intolerable. To be so grateful to him would look
like humiliation: you are</p><p>unworthy and he goes on giving to you -- you could not forgive him;
he is insulting you, he is making you aware of your unworthiness.</p><p>I have a friend who was at a time education minister. He used to come
to me once in a while, and one day he told me something that he would
not have told anybody: "I have thought many times to bring it to your
notice, but then I stopped myself. But there is a limit, I have to tell
it to you." He was born a poor man, and he was adopted by a rich man, a
very rich man, who had no children. So he suddenly rose from poverty to
be a super-rich man.</p><p>He started giving money to his relatives who were poor, because he
himself belonged to a poor family; his relatives were poor, his friends
were poor. And now he had so much, and he had got it without any effort,
and he was in a position to help everybody. He really helped all his
relatives, his father, his brother, his sisters, his friends, and he
made all of them very rich. I was aware of the fact.</p><p>He told me "The problem is, I have been so generous to everybody who
was even faraway connected -- a faraway cousin, or just an acquaintance
-- but if I saw that they were in trouble, I gave them as much as they
wanted; I gave them more. Now they are all flourishing, they are all
rich. But one thing strange is that they don't feel obliged towards me!
On the contrary, most of them never come to see me or meet me; in fact,
they avoid me. It hurts me very much, that I have done so much... and
what kind of ungrateful people are these?"</p><p>I said, "You don't understand the deeper psychology behind it. You
have given them, but you don't know that the giver always insults the
person he is giving. In the very giving you have become higher and the
person who has received has become lower. If you are an understanding
man, you will see this is actually what happens. I want to ask you one
thing: Have you ever accepted any help from them?"</p><p>He said, "I don't need it -- why should I accept their help?"</p><p>I said, "That's where you are humiliating them, insulting them. What
is wrong? -</p><p>- small things. If you just phone a friend whom you have helped, who
is now rich, has a factory of his own, cars of his own... if you just
ask him, `Send two cars; I need them very much.'</p><p>You may not need, you have enough cars! Just let those cars come, and
after an</p><p>hour send them back. You don't need, but let that man feel that he
can also give something to you, that he is not always on the receiving
end. He is sometimes on the giving side also.</p><p>"Or you can tell some friend, Ìn your garden I saw such beautiful
roses. Can you send me a dozen roses today?' And he will be immensely
happy to send those dozen roses. It doesn't cost him much, but he will
start forgiving you, and he will start being grateful to you."</p><p>The man said, "Perhaps you are right. I have never, never asked
anybody for anything, because I don't need. And I never thought that
just giving to somebody, and always giving and never taking..."</p><p>"Anything, anything without any value... a few flowers or just
calling the person and saying, Ì am feeling very lonely. Can you come
and be with me for breakfast or for the lunch? -- I will be immensely
grateful.' You would have helped those people to regain their dignity.
You have given them money but you have made them beggars, and nobody can
forgive you, this is utterly inhuman."</p><p>And he said, "I understand, but I will not be able to do it; it is
against my ego."</p><p>I said, "That is then absolutely clear why they are avoiding you:
they know that you are giving to them, not because they are poor but
because you are rich. You are not concerned with their problems and
worries and difficulties. You are just exploiting their misery, their
suffering, their poverty for your own ego fulfillment; Ì have been a
great help.' And you are bragging continuously... How can they forgive
you?"</p><p>That's what Albert Camus means when he says that if God did exist and
was available to humanity, we should have to abolish him because it
would become intolerable: he goes on giving and he will not ask for
anything from you because he has everything -- the whole belongs to him!
He would take away all your dignity. You can forgive somebody for
anything, but you cannot forgive anybody who destroys your dignity as a
human being, who takes away your pride.</p><p>Fortunately, there is no God, and particularly for you. There are
people who believe in God: deep down they are angry with him. They may
pray and they may show their respect, but deep down they think, "Why is
my wife suffering from cancer? If God is compassionate, then where is
his compassion? I have been praying for years, why am I poor? The people
who never pray and never</p><p>come to the church or the temple or the synagogue are rich! I am
honest and I am trying to be as sincere as human frailty will permit,
but I remain poor, a failure, a nobody... and the people who are mean
and cunning and can do anything to achieve power and money -- they are
successful. The priests go on saying that God is just. Where is your
justice?"</p><p>These things go on remaining in your unconscious -- you may not say
them because they may make God very angry. In fact, in the TALMUD, the
Jewish God says exactly the words, "I am a very angry God. I never
forgive; never take me for granted." A very beautiful sentence is: "I am
not your uncle, remember." That is very Jewish, but their God is a Jew,
you cannot do anything about it. He is reminding you, "I am not your
uncle, so don't expect any niceness from me. I am your father."</p><p>You know there is a difference between the father and the uncle:
uncles are always friendly; fathers are authoritarian, powerful people;
you belong to them. It is very rare to see a son and a father being
friendly, trusting each other, telling each other their innermost
thoughts and feelings. But you will always find people immensely
friendly with their uncles. They will not say things to just anybody
which they can say to their uncles; some different quality exists.</p><p>Such a God is not only Jewish, such a God is the God of all primitive
people. In all primitive, holy scriptures he is very angry. If he was
available in the world, Albert Camus is right, we would have to kill
him. It would become intolerable -- his interference in everything, his
commandments for everything, and his anger, and his violence, and his
torture; his blackmailing that he will throw you into hellfire for
eternity if you don't listen to him. And if you are obedient, in other
words if you are just a slave, you will have all the joys of paradise.
Such a God would not be tolerable, particularly to those who have some
pride of being individuals. It will be easier to finish him.</p><p>In fact, Sigmund Freud sometimes comes to very great insights; he was
certainly a genius. But unfortunately these people never came in contact
with any meditation; otherwise they would have given the world
tremendous contributions. Still, because of their genius they had
glimpses and insights. One of his insights, which may not be factual is
certainly psychological. The psychological is far more significant to
understand than the factual, because the factual is ordinary, outside
you; the psychological is within you and controls you.</p><p>Freud says that people worship God as father because some time in the
beginning they must have killed some dominant father, somebody who was
too dictatorial. It is a well-known fact that many kings have been
killed by their sons because the king was going on and on living. And
the son was becoming old and it seemed that he was not going to live to
be a king; the only possibility was the death of the father. Many kings
have imprisoned their fathers and taken over the throne, because they
saw that there seemed to be no possibility of his natural death -- at
least while there was time to enjoy being a king!</p><p>What would be the point when you are seventy-five or eighty when your
father dies and you succeed? Within a year or two you would be gone
too.</p><p>There is a possibility factually, but there is no historical record
of it; hence, historians have rejected the insight. But I am not a
historian and I think history is simply bunk! My concern with God is for
psychological reasons.</p><p>Sigmund Freud says that because somewhere in the past man had to kill
the father he felt the guilt of what he had done. And out of that guilt
he started worshipping the ancestors, the fathers, the elderly people,
the old people. All this respect has arisen out of a guilt which has
settled in the human heart. Man started inventing a God as father,
raising temples in his memory, statues, priests praying, worshipers
worshipping.</p><p>Behind this whole scene and drama of religion, Sigmund Freud finds
only one single fact and that is: somewhere in the past man has behaved
so badly with his father -- perhaps murdered -- that he cannot forgive
him. So the only way is to pray, make God your father, the creator of
the world. All these hypotheses... It was a very original insight.</p><p>A man who has no guilt will not go to a church, will not go to a
confessional in a Catholic church. For what? -- unless one enjoys
talking about so-called sins...!</p><p>I have heard...</p><p>One woman was coming every Sunday to the confessional, and confessing
the same sin that she had been raped. The bishop said, "That is not your
sin, you don't have to confess it -- let the person who has raped
you."</p><p>She said, "But I enjoyed it! That's why I have to confess it. I
pretended to resist, but deep down I enjoyed."</p><p>The priest said, "Even if you enjoyed it, you have been forgiven. You
have donated to the charity box, and I have prayed for you to God. And
this is the third time... who is this man? Is he the same man raping
again and again every week?"</p><p>She said, "I have to confess, he has raped me only once, and because
I enjoyed it he did not bother to rape me again. He looked
embarrassed... what is the point? In fact, he must have felt he had been
raped, tricked. So I go into places where he hangs around; the moment he
sees me, he escapes."</p><p>But the priest said, "If it has happened only once then what is the
point every week to come to the confession?"</p><p>She said, "I enjoy the idea and to tell you in detail. It is nothing
to me -- ten dollars I can give as a punishment, and you can pray for my
sin. But I enjoy even describing it."</p><p>My own feeling is that the number of people who confess in the
Catholic church, most of them have not committed those sins. They simply
enjoy the idea, "I raped a woman."</p><p>Perhaps they want to rape a woman, but it is a difficult job. But to
confess is very simple, just ten dollars. And for ten dollars, enjoying
the idea that I raped the woman... At least the priest is convinced and
he will convince God too.</p><p>Sigmund Freud seems to me to be psychologically right; otherwise
there would be no temples, no churches, no mosques, no gods. Man needed
someone to pray to, needed someone to complain to, needed someone to
throw all responsibility onto. But if he was available in the world,
just in the M.G. market, he would have been killed -- and particularly
in Poona.</p><p>You will be surprised to know that this M.G. Road is named after
Mahatma Gandhi; M.G. is short for Mahatma Gandhi Road -- and Poona has
killed, assassinated Mahatma Gandhi! The day a Poona-ite assassinated
Mahatma Gandhi sweets were distributed and there was celebration. And
now they are calling their main market M.G. market. This is the guilt
that somehow has to be erased, so they have raised the statue to Mahatma
Gandhi. Strange... you kill the man and then you raise the statue.</p><p>You must have seen on the hills, just nearby the bridge, there is one
beautiful</p><p>bungalow where Mahatma Gandhi used to stay. The people to whom that
bungalow belongs used to come to listen to me in Bombay. And when I was
moving to Poona, I said to those people, "That bungalow is empty and
that will be the best place for the ashram because of the hills around;
the road goes round and round -- and the whole hill part belongs to the
bungalow. For the ashram it will be perfect, and whatever your
price...</p><p>They said, "It is not a question of price, it is because Mahatma
Gandhi used to stay there, so we have made it a memorial." Now it is a
Mahatma Gandhi memorial -- there is a statue, there is a memorial.</p><p>Just by the other side of the river there is one palace, Aga Khan
Palace, where the British government used to imprison Mahatma Gandhi, as
a special concession, because it is not a jail; it is a palace, it was
used for Mahatma Gandhi. Whenever the government wanted to put him in
jail the palace was used, and he was free to move in the gardens. He was
provided with his secretaries, with his wife; he continued to function
just as if he was outside. In fact, he was in a better position; outside
he used to live in small huts because poverty was his philosophy. Here
he was living in the Aga Khan's Palace, one of the most beautiful
buildings in Poona, with a vast garden.</p><p>His wife died while he was in prison in the Aga Khan Palace. His
wife's samadhi is in the Aga Khan Palace, so now the Aga Khan Palace has
also become part of a memorial.</p><p>Because Mahatma Gandhi was imprisoned there and his wife died
there... And it was a group of Hindu chauvinists of Poona who killed
him. And now they are trying to somehow erase the guilt feeling --
making memorials, making statues, giving names to the streets.</p><p>Sigmund Freud is right in my understanding that man must have behaved
badly in the past with their elders, particularly the fathers. And there
is a possibility that fathers may have been killed, because they were
holding all the power -- and all the power included all the beautiful
women of the clan. The sons were young, they needed beautiful women; the
father was old but he was holding all the beautiful women: unless he
dies, there is no possibility for the young people to have those
beautiful women, they were that old man's property.</p><p>Psychologists have been trying to find the same pattern in monkeys.
If you see</p><p>monkeys sitting on a tree, you will be surprised to know that on top
is the oldest monkey, the most powerful monkey. He is the president!
Nobody else will be allowed to sit on the top of the trees; that is a
question of prestige and power. And around him are all the beautiful
females. He is old but even the youngest females first have to be under
his control. Then underneath that are other elders, and underneath that
are the young people.</p><p>Naturally, there is every possibility -- and it happens -- that the
older monkey is killed by the younger monkey because he is taking away
their whole life. He has lived enough and he goes on living -- and he is
holding all the power. There is a deep will to power in everybody, and
particularly the power over the females. Nobody can even look at those
females while the old man is alive. They don't have any other money and
treasure and kingdoms; their only property is the females. On this point
of the females, many old monkeys are killed.</p><p>Perhaps this discovery by the scientists led to the insight of
Sigmund Freud that one day men killed their fathers -- had to kill, had
to remove them, otherwise they wouldn't allow you to live at all.</p><p>If God did exist, it is absolutely certain he would have been
assassinated -- it would have become absolutely intolerable. But
fortunately, he does not exist so nobody can assassinate him. But
unfortunately, people have created a hypothetical God which neither you
can assassinate nor you can communicate with. It is a simple hypothesis,
but still it helps people to get rid of their guilt.</p><p>The priest is the beneficiary; he keeps the hypothesis alive. He
fights for the hypothesis, because all that comes to God as offerings to
erase the guilt of people reaches the priest.</p><p>So the priest's whole work is to make more and more people guilty.
This is a business and a very subtle structure: make people guilty about
everything, every pleasure.</p><p>In Jainism, even to eat food tastefully is a sin; you should not eat
tastefully. You can eat, but don't take the taste, don't enjoy it. That
is possible only if your taste buds are operated on; otherwise it is not
possible. Your tongue and your taste buds... and they are not many, they
can be removed very easily. Then you won't taste anything. But that is
not the idea.</p><p>The idea is that because of those taste buds you will have to taste
and then you</p><p>will feel guilty. And once you are guilty, you are in the hands of
the priest.</p><p>Now sex is not in your hands. Feeling good and happy with a restful
night is natural, but Jainism condemns it. Jaina monks should eat only
one time a day, and that too, standing because being comfortably seated
you can eat more; standing you will get tired yourself.</p><p>And it looks so embarrassing -- a crowd, and you are standing, and
you have to take your food in your hands.</p><p>The Jaina monk is not allowed to have anything as his possession. So
how much can you take in your hands? -- and you cannot take twice. So
they are hungry. To think of food or to think of women or to think of
any pleasure is a sin -- even to think, even to dream. And I cannot
conceive that a Jaina monk can avoid dreaming about food, or that
so-called celibates -- Jaina, Catholics, Buddhists, Hindus -- can avoid
dreaming about women?</p><p>And the priests say that whether you dream or you actually act it
does not matter: even to dream about good food is as sinful as actually
eating it because the question is of your mentality; to dream about a
beautiful woman is as sinful as having a beautiful woman.</p><p>All the religious priests for thousands of years have been managing
to find all those areas where you are weak, where nature can be
condemned. And you cannot do anything because it is a natural thing, so
naturally, you will feel guilty.</p><p>Guilt is the whole foundation of your religions.</p><p>The priest needs you to be guilty, and because of guilt you need God
-- who is going to forgive you? What are your prayers? "Forgive us, we
are sinners and your compassion is great. Forgive us father." And there
is nobody to listen to you!</p><p>Because God is just a hypothesis, assassination is not possible. You
cannot find him anywhere. Albert Camus is right: if God did not exist,
we would have to invent him.</p><p>That's what we have done, we have invented him. If God did exist we
would have to abolish him. The existential problem is what I have told
you, the feeling that I am unworthy.</p><p>It is true:</p><p>Nobody is worthy.</p><p>We have received everything for no reason at all.</p><p>Being grateful to existence is the only authentic religion, and it
does not need to have an adjective to it -- Christian or Hindu or
Mohammedan. It is simply gratefulness.</p><p>Vidhan, you are on the right track; just don't get stuck at
unworthiness, that is one side of the coin. The other side of the coin
is gratefulness. This is the negative side; that is the positive
side.</p><p>Remember, always to go with the affirmative, the positive, and you
will never go astray.</p><p>The ultimate affirmation comes the day when you explode into light,
into joy, into bliss, into song, into dance. All that will create more
and more gratefulness in you.</p><p>You will become just a prayer. Question 2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THE OTHER MORNING, WHEN YOU MENTIONED ABOUT A POCKET WATCH</p><p>BEING THE LAST PRESENT FOR PEOPLE WHO RETIRE, I WAS AMAZED, BECAUSE
WHEN YOU LEFT FOR AMERICA I WAS AT MY VILLAGE, AND I RECEIVED BY MAIL A
UNIQUE PRESENT FROM YOU</p><p>-- A VERY BEAUTIFUL</p><p>SEIKO POCKET WATCH! I WAS DELIGHTED BY THIS RARE GIFT, BUT TODAY I
FEEL A BIT SHAKY!</p><p>BELOVED OSHO, COULD YOU PLEASE TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT</p><p>THE</p><p>SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS GIFT?</p><p>Sardar Gurudayal Singh, I remember the pocket watch that I have sent
you. I have been giving watches to hundreds of my sannyasins. The
significance is simple, so you need not be worried by what I said
yesterday.</p><p>It was not a retirement gift; a sannyasins is never retired! He
becomes enlightened, but retirement is not possible neither before
enlightenment nor after enlightenment.</p><p>Retirement does not exist in the world of a sannyasin, so you can
drop your fear and worry; it was not a retirement gift. I have been
giving watches to many people because my whole message is: be
watchful!</p><p>So don't misunderstand me...</p><p>A man in New York for the weekend, struck up a conversation with a
young lady in the bar. After a few drinks he suggested that they buy a
bottle and go to his room; she agreed.</p><p>When the girl began taking off her clothes, the man asked, "Say, how
old are you?"</p><p>"Thirteen," she replied.</p><p>"Thirteen? Good Lord," said the man. "Get your clothes back on and
get out of here."</p><p>At the door the girl paused and said, "Superstitious, eh?"</p><p>In America, the number thirteen is very superstitious! You will find
in hotels that after the twelfth storey comes the fourteenth. The
thirteenth storey does not exist at all because nobody is ready to stay
on the thirteenth floor.</p><p>I have seen one book: a man had done great research work proving that
this superstition of the number thirteen is not just superstition, it
has a scientific background. I was very much amazed so I went through
the book. It was sheer nonsense what he had done. He had collected the
number of accidents which had</p><p>happened on the thirteenth date, the number of people who died on the
thirteenth, the number of people who got cancer on the thirteenth... all
kinds of calamities that happened on the thirteenth. He had collected
such a list that anybody would be greatly impressed that certainly this
number thirteen is dangerous.</p><p>I wrote a letter to the man saying, "Unless you do the same research
for the eleventh and for the twelfth -- just two dates will do, one
before thirteenth... and find out what happens on the twelfth, what
happens on the eleventh, all the calamities... And unless you find that
more accidents happen on the thirteenth than on the twelfth or eleventh,
that more people die on the thirteenth than on any other date, your
thesis is just nonsense. This way you can prove any date dangerous,
because people are dying on every date, every day. There is no quota
given for dates."</p><p>I received a letter saying that the man had died; unfortunately he
died on the eleventh!</p><p>One of his friends replied that the man himself had missed the
thirteenth. But in America that superstition is very prevalent. People
don't want the number thirteen on their car; they avoid the number
thirteen in every way. In the army you won't find a soldier whose number
is thirteen.</p><p>Sardar Gurudayal Singh, that retirement watch is also a superstition,
but it is possible that whoever invented it first may have had some idea
similar to me, that now a man is retiring, life is in a way finished. It
is good to give him a watch because the days are few, time will be
rushing by faster than ever. So it will be helpful to keep him alert,
watchful.</p><p>Time is not money, time is life, and to give a watch... Now it has
become superstition nobody bothers what is the meaning. Nobody knows
either the people who are giving or the person who is receiving... but
just a golden pocket watch.</p><p>But when I have given watches -- and I go on giving -- that does not
mean that you are retired. That does not mean that your days are
finished, "Just count the hours on your watch."</p><p>It means: Be watchful, be aware and alert.</p><p>Every moment is full of danger and full of ecstasy. If you can use it
for awareness and watchfulness, it becomes a great ecstasy, the juiciest
experience of life. But if you are not aware, some moment, some day, you
are going to die...</p><p>Don't die before destroying your ego.</p><p>Let the ego die first so that you can realize your real immortal
being.</p><p>I have given it to you, Gurudayal, just to be watchful, because one
can get into any trouble -- particularly a man like Gurudayal.</p><p>A few days ago somebody came to me to inform me that Sardar Gurudayal
Singh was going to marry Mukta. I said, "I am telling enough jokes, and
he is trying to be a practical joke!" And Mukta is also great! She has
found poor Sardar Gurudayal Singh. He is a rare man, a happy man, but to
find him for marriage...! And he is such a fellow he will not say no. He
has known life in many colors: he has been in the army, he has fought in
the wars; he has been my bodyguard for many years, and he is of a simple
and innocent heart. If somebody approaches him for marriage at this age,
he will say okay.</p><p>Somehow I have persuaded Mukta not to do such a thing, because he is
living a free life.</p><p>He has divorced his wife long, long ago; he has not a single worry in
the world. He is one of my most profound sannyasins -- poor, but
immensely rich because he can laugh more beautifully than anybody else.
I don't have to know where he is sitting. When he starts laughing I know
because his laughter, even in his old age, comes louder than anybody
else's.</p><p>No need to worry about that watch! Just be watchful; don't get into
any trouble. Now, getting married to Mukta... You will be in trouble;
she will be in trouble. She is enjoying fully. She has divorced her
husband long ago; you have divorced your wife -- both are free. But I
must say that Mukta has an eye to find a real man!</p><p>Two jokes for Sardar Gurudayal Singh...</p><p>"You will be poor and unhappy until you are forty," said the
fortune-teller to her customer.</p><p>"Then what?" asked the worried customer.</p><p>"Well, by then you will be used to it," the fortune-teller
replied!</p><p>A man approaching retirement went along to see the company doctor for
one final checkup. To his horror the doctor said, "I don't know quite
how to put this, but your heart is on its last legs and you have only
got six months to live."</p><p>"Is there nothing I can do?" asked the shocked man.</p><p>"Well," said the doctor, "you can give up alcohol, and cut out
smoking. Don't eat rich foods, no dancing, and don't even think about
sex!"</p><p>"And this will make me live longer?" the man asked hopefully. "No,"
replied the doctor, "it will just seem longer!"</p><p>Okay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.</p><p>The Invitation Chapter #23</p><p>Chapter title: What kind of vehicle are you using 1 September 1987 pm

ALSO, BEING REJECTED SEXUALLY BY A BOYFRIEND</p><p>HAS CONTRIBUTED; ALTHOUGH I SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT --</p><p>OR TRY TO.</p><p>I CAN REMEMBER A TIME WHEN, WITH NO BOYFRIENDS, I WOULD FEEL</p><p>MY SEXUAL ENERGY AND YET IT WOULD NEED NO OUTLET. IT WOULD</p><p>STAY IN MY BODY AND I WOULD FEEL ORGASMIC ALL OVER.</p><p>BUT NOW I FEEL IMPRISONED BY REPRESSED SEX AND NEED YOUR</p><p>GUIDANCE.</p><p>Prem Shunyo, you are simply confused. You are not sexually repressed.
You are simply an English lady. It seems you had forgotten it.</p><p>Just a few days ago a drunkard was arrested in France. He was making
love to a dead woman on the beach. When asked, he said, "I thought she
is English."</p><p>Don't be worried about repression. And moreover you are coming to the
age when everybody feels disturbed, particularly women from the West.
Middle age is a troublesome and anguish-creating state.</p><p>A few things for you to contemplate...</p><p>First, one has to recognize that one is getting into middle age.</p><p>Middle age is when you still believe you will feel better in the
morning.</p><p>Middle age is when you want to see how long your car will last
instead of how fast it will go.</p><p>Middle age is when you are home on Saturday night, the telephone
rings and you hope it is not for you.</p><p>Middle age is when you change from stud to dud.</p><p>Middle age is when you stop criticizing the older generation and
start criticizing the younger one.</p><p>These are just symptoms I am telling you, so..!</p><p>Shunyo, people who have been here with me for almost ten or twelve
years cannot be sexually repressed. That is my whole condemnation all
over the world; you can call it my reputation. And asking me a question
about sexual repression is just destroying my reputation!</p><p>Two men sitting in a bar were commiserating about married life. "I
know a man," says one, "who has been married for thirty years and he
spends every evening at home."</p><p>"That's what I call love," says the other.</p><p>"Oh, really?" replied the first, "the doctor called it paralysis." It
all depends how you take it.</p><p>You are not sexually repressed. You suddenly remembered that you are
an English lady...</p><p>where are you?... what are you doing here?</p><p>A commissar was visiting a collective farm to check on the season's
crops. "How are the potatoes?" he inquired.</p><p>"The potatoes are so plentiful," a farmer replied, "that if we put
them end to end they will touch the feet of God."</p><p>"How can that be?" blurted the commissar, "there is no God." "Well,"
the farmer answered, "there are no potatoes either."</p><p>Shunyo, all that has happened is that that crazy Milarepa has escaped
from you. But don't be worried; he is crazy enough, he will come
back.</p><p>You can rely on me, I will see to it that the poor fellow comes back.
He will roam about in the ashram a few days. You enjoy the freedom, and
don't be worried; he cannot get lost. Finally he is going to come to
you.</p><p>This has been going on for years. I have been watching it, I have
never said anything to you. It is not something new. Hundreds of times
he must have left you and he has come back. He is a very tame fellow.
You have just to give him enough rope, so that he can enjoy the idea
that he is free.</p><p>There is nothing to worry about. You simply enjoy a few days of peace
and silence, and paralysis.</p><p>It is very rare to find time to be alone, to be oneself. It is
fortunate to find some people who once in a while escape, before they
get caught somewhere else. And he has proved so reliable that many times
I was thinking, now he is lost -- and I see him back again.</p><p>You just have to learn patience. And by the way, it is a good excuse
to learn patience, waiting and trusting that he will come. Suddenly, one
night he will start knocking on your door.</p><p>I don't think that there is any other woman who can tolerate him long
enough except Prem Shunyo -- she is almost immune to Milarepa.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>FOR TEN YEARS I HAVE THOUGHT THAT WHEN YOU SAID THERE IS NO</p><p>TIME-SPACE SEPARATION BETWEEN THE MASTER AND THE DISCIPLE, AND</p><p>WHEN YOU SAID THE DISCIPLE HAS TO MELT INTO THE MASTER SO THAT</p><p>THEIR HEARTS BEAT TOGETHER, I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE SIMPLY</p><p>BEING POETIC. THE OTHER EVENING WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT</p><p>THIS RELATIONSHIP, I SUDDENLY GOT THAT YOU MEAN WHAT YOU SAY</p><p>SO POETICALLY.</p><p>I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE YOU HOME WITH ME IN MY HEART, MY BELOVED</p><p>MASTER, AND I AM A SLOW LEARNER WITH A FRIGHTENED HEART AND</p><p>ONLY SIX WEEKS.</p><p>WILL YOU COME WITH ME THIS TIME?</p><p>Prem Dheera, the first time you were right, when you thought I was
simply being poetic.</p><p>The second time you were wrong, when you started thinking that I mean
what I say so poetically -- I don't mean. If I start going into
everybody's hearts it will be impossible to put me together again!</p><p>You can love me wherever you are. You can feel me wherever you
are.</p><p>But poetry is poetry; don't make it something pragmatic and
practical. When I talk about melting and about merging and about having
a heart-to-heart communion, don't take it that that's actually what I
mean. Those are only indications towards a very subtle phenomenon in
which I remain I, you remain you. In fact, you become more yourself than
you have ever been before.</p><p>If love cannot give you individuality, uniqueness, that love is
impotent. The power of love consists of giving you freedom and authentic
individuality and being. That's the way to take me with you.</p><p>When you become an individual, peaceful, silent, utterly free from
all kinds of bondage, then your freedom, your uniqueness, your love all
indicate that you are taking me home.</p><p>You should not take me as a person.</p><p>You should take me as the values which I am teaching to you. If you
take those values with your heart, you are taking me; hence I say again,
the first time you were right when you thought I was being poetic.
Poetry should never be understood literally; it is symbolic, but it is
significant. Just because it is only symbolic does not mean it is
insignificant. Its significance certainly does not consist in being
factual. It is something much more than fact, it is truth itself.</p><p>Ordinarily we don't make any distinction between fact and truth.
Factually you cannot take me in your heart -- that is an impossibility.
But truthfully, you can take me in your heart. That will mean my
fragrance, my joy, my meditativeness, my ecstasy, my presence but not my
person.</p><p>If you can understand this there is no problem -- I can come with
you.</p><p>Just one thing to be remembered: what kind of vehicle are you
using?</p><p>A Frenchman, a German and a Russian were boasting about the modes of
transportation at their disposal.</p><p>"I drive a Renault to work," said the Frenchman. "On Sundays I drive
my Peugeot. And when I go abroad, I drive a Citroen."</p><p>"I drive a Volkswagen to work," said the German. "On Sundays I drive
my BMW, and when I go abroad I drive a Mercedes."</p><p>"As for me," said the Russian, "I take the bus to work. On Sundays I
drive around in my little Moskvitch. And when I go abroad, I drive a
tank."</p><p>So just be careful if you are taking me in you heart, that you don't
drive a tank -- I am a peaceful person and I don't want to go to war!
But as far as my presence is concerned you are absolutely allowed to
take me with you.</p><p>My whole effort here is not to create an illusion in you, but on the
contrary to destroy all possibilities of illusion. Man has lived under
all kinds of illusions; he is surrounded by hallucinations. When you
fall in love with someone it is very rarely a true experience.</p><p>More often it is only an illusion, an idea, a projection. When you
see someone as beautiful it is more your biology that is creating the
illusion of beauty. Once your biological infatuation is finished the
beauty will disappear; the same woman will not look beautiful at
all.</p><p>From the very beginning the woman has known the psychology of man
better than man understands woman's psychology. In fact, man has been
continuously saying that woman is a mystery. I don't see any mystery
anywhere. I have known more women than perhaps anybody else in the
world, and I have known men also. None of them is a mystery.</p><p>Everything is absolutely clear, but you don't want to see it clearly
-- you want to go on having illusions. Illusions are sweet, nice,
beautiful. The truth, the bare, naked truth is not so sweet.</p><p>Gautam Buddha continuously says that when you see a beautiful woman,
don't forget that she is just a skeleton, just as you are a skeleton,
covered with a bag of</p><p>skin. Maybe someone has a little longer nose and somebody has a
little smaller nose, and somebody has round eyes and somebody has a
different shape, but inside it is the same blood, bones, flesh. Beauty
seems to be only skin-deep.</p><p>If you have X-ray eyes you will be surrounded with skeletons all
around.</p><p>Just recently it happened in Europe that one woman was driving a
crane and she struck an electric pole. The shock was so tremendous, she
fell down in a coma. She did not die, but after a few hours she came
back to consciousness with a strange phenomenon: her eyes had become
X-ray eyes. Now she is suffering from a tremendous migraine... but
doctors are using her in the hospital as an X- ray machine. She has
opened a new dimension.</p><p>Because of too much electricity the eyes have changed. Now they can
see deep down inside you, and she is completely horrified. She cannot
open her eyes because she cannot see your face; she can see only your
skeleton. She cannot see your skin and your beautiful nose. She is the
first woman who sees people as they actually are, without any
illusions.</p><p>Asked, "Do you feel some difference between beautiful people and
ugly?" -- she laughed.</p><p>She said, "There is no one who is beautiful and no one who is ugly.
All are skeletons and horrible."</p><p>A man was admitted to a psychiatric hospital because he thought he
was Ronald Reagan.</p><p>But this caused a problem for the staff because they already had a
Ronald Reagan on the books and the director thought it might cause
trouble. But then he hit upon a brilliant idea. On his first night at
the hospital, one of the staff put him in the same cell as the other
Ronald Reagan in the hope that this confrontation would bring one or
both to their senses.</p><p>The next morning he called the new man to his office and asked how
his first night had been.</p><p>"Oh, doctor," replied the man, "I have been living under a delusion
for many years."</p><p>"That's an amazing insight," said the doctor excitedly. "Please go
on."</p><p>"Well," continued the man, "for as long as I can remember, I thought
I was Ronald Reagan, but I'm not."</p><p>"That's very good," said the doctor. "So who are you?"</p><p>The man looked at the doctor, smiled sweetly and said, "I'm Nancy."
People go on changing their illusions.</p><p>I want you to come out of all the illusions and just see reality as
it is. It is simple and it is beautiful. In the beginning you may be
shocked because your delusions are destroyed.</p><p>But as you will become more and more accustomed and in accord with
existence and reality, you will feel a tremendous freedom and a great
sense of authenticity.</p><p>Gautam Buddha's statement is on record that to experience truth in
the beginning is bitter, in the end it is very sweet. But illusions are
totally different, just the contrary: in the beginning they are very
sweet; in the end they turn out very bitter. In fact, this should be the
criterion: something that is sweet in the beginning, be aware of it; it
is illusion. Soon you will be awakened out of it and it will hurt and it
will feel very bitter. It is better to experience truth, which is bitter
in the beginning but in the end proves to be the sweetest experience
possible.</p><p>So when I am talking to you, I have to be poetic for the simple
reason that there are things which cannot be said in prose. There are
things which can only be hinted at in a poetic way. But poetry can
always be misunderstood because poetry is symbolic and you cannot take
it as actual. The moment you take poetry as literal and factual, you are
creating an illusion which will sooner or later be destroyed by the
reality.</p><p>No illusion can live for long.</p><p>Every illusion has a very small lifespan.</p><p>I don't want you to get into any kind of illusory relationship with
me. I have been talking about the master and the disciple relationship
from different angles,</p><p>emphasizing many things; this also should be remembered, that all
that has been said to you about it is poetic and symbolic.</p><p>You cannot merge or melt actually, but you can merge and melt by
dropping your ego.</p><p>That's exactly the intention, that you drop the ego; that between the
master and the disciple there will be only two persons -- the master and
the disciple -- not four persons, the ego of the master and the ego of
the disciple and then the master and the disciple behind their egos.</p><p>That is happening in almost all your relationships. On every bed
where you find a couple, just look closely, you will find four persons:
two real persons and two unreal persons.</p><p>Those two unreal persons are created by both projecting something
onto the other.</p><p>Naturally there is going to be disillusionment. Every relationship
comes into a state of disillusionment; then it really hurts. Never
create any relationship with projection.</p><p>Avoid your ego, avoid your mind.</p><p>Just see clearly without any thoughts disturbing your vision and you
will never create a relationship. You will have relatedness, you will
have deep intimacy but there will be no relationship, no binding;
otherwise every relationship becomes a kind of marriage. And the moment
something becomes a marriage it has turned into an imprisonment.
Certainly, the master disciple relationship cannot be allowed to turn
into a marriage; that will destroy its whole purpose.</p><p>The whole purpose is to give you freedom, to help you to be free from
all kinds of chains which you have mistaken for ornaments; to take you
out of your imprisonment which you have taken as your home; to make you
aware that your religion, your nation, your race, your caste, your
ideology, all are different kinds of imprisonments, and they all turn
you into prisoners.</p><p>They decorate their chains with flowers, they make their chains with
gold, but it does not matter whether the chains are made of gold or of
steel -- chains are chains, and they destroy your dignity. They destroy
your humanity, they reduce</p><p>you into a slave. The whole of humanity is living in many kinds of
slaveries.</p><p>The slavery has become multidimensional: you belong to a race, you
belong to a nation, you belong to a religion, you belong to a political
party... And all these are causes of your slavery; all these are
destructive to your spirituality.</p><p>An authentic human being does not belong to any religion, does not
belong to any nation, does not belong to any race. He is simply part of
existence. Why belong to small trivial crowds when you can belong to the
whole universe? And with belonging to the whole universe there is an
immense difference.</p><p>When you belong to the whole, it gives you freedom because the whole
is unlimited and there are no limitations, no boundaries.</p><p>The whole can never become a prison to you.</p><p>The awakened man lives in the whole, belongs to the whole universe.
He does not belong to small cages howsoever beautiful they may be.</p><p>I want my people to belong to the whole. That's the only way I can
help you, and I can show my love to you and my respect to you. It has
not been the case in the past: no master has been respectful towards his
disciples. He has asked that the disciples should be respectful towards
him; that they should be grateful towards him; that they should be
surrendered to him. These are very subtle games of the ego.</p><p>If you love, if your love is real, you will not ask for surrender. If
your love is real you will have tremendous respect, it does not matter
whether you are master or disciple.</p><p>Respect, reverence for life, does not need any special qualification.
You will be respectful to the trees and to the birds and to the stars
too.</p><p>A master who is not respectful to his disciples has no right to have
any respect from the disciples either; it is a mutual understanding and
awareness. The master is not in any way holier-than-thou or
higher-than-thou. He may be more experienced in certain ways, he may be
richer in his inner world, but that does not create any hierarchy. All
hierarchies are created by the ego, and to be a master, to be an
awakened person, the first thing is to drop the ego then you cannot
create any hierarchy.</p><p>There is a beautiful story about Gautam Buddha's past life...</p><p>He loved to relate about his many past lives. At least twenty-four
past lives he has related in his discourses to his disciples --
beautiful stories. It does not matter whether they are historically true
or not. There is no way to find it out, and there is no reason to be
worried about whether they are historical or not -- they are
significant.</p><p>He says, "In one of my past lives, when I was as unconscious as you
are, when I was as miserable as you are, when I was searching for a
master as you have come to me searching for a master, I heard about a
man who had become enlightened. Immediately I rushed and when I reached
a great crowd had already arrived.</p><p>"I touched the feet of the man who had become enlightened and the
most surprising thing was that I had no thought of touching the feet --
it simply happened. Just the presence of the man was so immense, I found
myself touching his feet without my will, without my thought, without my
preparation, without even my readiness. I had just come to see out of
curiosity whether he was really realized or not, and what had
happened.</p><p>"As I came close to him something transpired and I touched his feet.
I stood back and even a greater miracle happened: that man touched my
feet.</p><p>"I said to him, `What are you doing? You are awakened, enlightened; I
am an ignorant man in search of a master, and masters don't touch the
feet of the disciples.'</p><p>"And the awakened man said, Ì don't belong to that category of
masters. I am ready to touch everybody's feet because I know they are
all going to become enlightened one day or other. And there are only
seven days in a week! Somebody becomes enlightened on Monday and
somebody becomes enlightened on Sunday -- it does not matter. One thing
is certain, that everybody carries inside him a buddha. And I can see in
you that it is not going to be long before you will be enlightened. I
can see the seed has already died and that new sprouts have started
growing within you. Seeing your great future, I touched your feet, and
also to remind you that when you become an enlightened man, remember
that one enlightened man has touched your feet when you were just a
disciple.'"</p><p>Gautam Buddha used to relate this story again and again to his
disciples saying,</p><p>"I have as much respect towards you as you have. I have found the
truth; you are searching for it.</p><p>It is not much of a difference. I have arrived; you are
arriving."</p><p>I don't want to create any kind of illusory relationship between me
and you. I want to stand alone and I want you also to stand alone, and
in our aloneness we shall meet.</p><p>In our aloneness, in our freedom we shall have reverence and we shall
have love, but our love will not be a bondage, and our respect will not
create a hierarchy.</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>PLEASE SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE DISCIPLE'S ALONENESS AND COURAGE.</p><p>Anand Taral, the first thing to realize is that whether you want or
not, you are alone.</p><p>Aloneness is your very nature.</p><p>You can try to forget it, you can try not to be alone by making
friends, having lovers, mixing in the crowd... But whatever you do
remains just on the surface. Deep inside, your aloneness is unreachable,
untouchable.</p><p>A strange accident happens to every human being: as he is born the
very situation of his birth begins in a family. And there is no other
way, because the human child is the weakest child in the whole of
existence.</p><p>Other animals are born complete. A dog is going to remain a dog his
whole life, he is not going to evolve, grow. Yes, he will become aged,
old, but he will not become more intelligent, he will not become more
aware, he will not become enlightened. In that sense all the animals
remain exactly at the point of their birth; nothing essential changes in
them. Their death and their birth are horizontal -- in one line.</p><p>Only man has the possibility of going vertical, upwards, not just
horizontal. Most of humanity behaves like other animals: life is just
growing old -- not growing up. Growing up and growing old are totally
different experiences.</p><p>Man is born in a family amongst human beings. From the very first
moment he is not alone; hence, he gets a certain psychology of always
remaining with people. In aloneness he starts feeling scared... unknown
fears. He is not exactly aware of what he is afraid of, but as he moves
out of the crowd something inside him becomes uneasy. To be with others
he feels cozy, at ease, comfortable.</p><p>It is because of this reason he never comes to know the beauty of
aloneness; the fear prevents him. Because he was born in a group he
remains part of a group, and as he grows in age he starts making new
groups, new associations, new friends. Already, existing collectivities
don't satisfy him: the nation, the religion, the political party... He
creates his own new associations: Rotary Club, Lions Club. But all these
strategies are just to avoid one thing: never to be alone.</p><p>The whole life experience is of being together with people. Aloneness
seems almost like a death. In a way it is a death; it is the death of
the personality that you have created in the crowd. That is a gift of
others to you. The moment you move out of the crowd you also move out of
your personality.</p><p>In the crowd you know exactly who you are: you know your name, you
know your degrees, you know your profession; you know everything that is
needed for your passport, your identity card. But the moment you move
out of the crowd, what is your identity, who are you? Suddenly you
become aware that you are not your name -- your name was given to you.
You are not your race -- what relationship has race with your
consciousness? Your heart is not Hindu or Mohammedan; your being is not
confined to any political boundaries of a nation; your consciousness is
not part of any organization or church. Who are you?</p><p>Suddenly your personality starts dispersing. This is the fear: the
death of the personality.</p><p>Now you will have to discover freshly, you will have to ask for the
first time who you are. You will have to start meditating on the fact:
Who am I? -- and there is a fear that you may not be at all. Perhaps you
were nothing but a combination of all the opinions of the crowd, that
you were nothing but your personality.</p><p>Nobody wants to be nothing. Nobody wants to be nobody.</p><p>And in fact everybody is a nobody. There is a very beautiful
story...</p><p>Alice has reached Wonderland. She came to meet the king and the king
asked, "Alice, did you meet a messenger coming towards me?"</p><p>She said, "I met nobody."</p><p>The king said, "If you met nobody, why has he not arrived yet?"</p><p>Alice was very much puzzled. She said, "You are not understanding me
rightly. Nobody is nobody."</p><p>The king said, "That is obvious that nobody is nobody, but where is
he? He should have reached here by this time. It simply means nobody
walks slower than you."</p><p>And naturally Alice was very much annoyed and forgot that she is
talking to the king.</p><p>She said, "Nobody walks faster than me."</p><p>Now the whole conversation goes on with that "nobody." She
understands that he is saying, "Nobody walks slower than you."</p><p>"... and I am a fast walker. I have come from the other world to
Wonderland, a small world -- and he is insulting me." Naturally she
retorts, "Nobody walks faster than me!"</p><p>The king said, "If that is right then why has he not arrived?" And
this way the discussion continues.</p><p>Everybody is a nobody.</p><p>So the first problem for a disciple is to understand exactly the
nature of</p><p>aloneness. It means nobodiness; it means dropping your personality
which is a gift to you by the crowd.</p><p>As you move off out of the crowd you cannot take that gift with you
in your aloneness. In your aloneness you will have to discover again
afresh, and nobody can give you the guarantee whether you will find
anybody inside or not.</p><p>Those who have reached to aloneness have found nobody there. I really
mean no body.</p><p>No name, no form, but a pure presence, a pure life, nameless,
formless. This is exactly the true resurrection, and it certainly needs
courage. Only very courageous people have been able to accept with joy
their nobodiness, their nothingness. Their nothingness is their pure
being; it is a death and a resurrection both.</p><p>Just today Hasya was showing me a small, beautiful cartoon: Jesus
hanging on the cross, looking at the sky, is saying, "It would have been
better if alongside God the father I had Allah the uncle. It would have
been better; at least if God was not listening, Allah might have
helped."</p><p>Having just God for his whole life he was very happy proclaiming, "I
am the only begotten son of God." And he never talked about God's
family, his brother, his wife, his other sons and daughters. In the
whole of eternity what has he been doing? He does not have a TV to waste
time, to pass time. He does not have any possibility of having a movie
hall. What does this poor fellow go on doing?</p><p>It is a well-known fact that in poor countries the population goes on
exploding for the simple reason that the poor man has no other free
entertainment. The only free entertainment is to produce children.
Although it is in the long run very costly, right now there is no
ticket, no problem, no standing in the queue...</p><p>What has God been doing for the whole eternity? He has created only
one son. Now on the cross he remembers that it would have been better if
God really had a few brothers, sisters, uncles. "I could have asked help
from somebody else if he is not listening to me."</p><p>He is praying and he is being angry saying, "Why have you forgotten
me? Have you given up on me?" -- but there is no answer.</p><p>He is waiting for the miracle. The whole crowd that has gathered to
see the miracle by and by started dispersing. It was too hot,
unnecessarily. Nothing is going to happen; if something was going to
happen it would have happened.</p><p>After six hours there were only three ladies left who were still
believing that a miracle may happen. One was Jesus' mother -- naturally,
mothers go on believing that their child is a genius. Every mother,
without exception, believes that she has given birth to a child which is
a giant.</p><p>Another woman who loved Jesus was a prostitute, Mary Magdalene. That
woman, although she was a prostitute, must have loved Jesus. Even the
disciples, the so-called apostles, who became second to Jesus in
importance in the history of Christianity, all twelve escaped just out
of fear of being caught and of being recognized -- because they were
always hanging around with Jesus, everywhere. You never can believe the
crowd: if they were caught, they might have been crucified, if not
crucified at least beaten, stoned to death. Only three women were
left.</p><p>The third was another woman who loved Jesus. It was love that
remained in the last moments in the form of these three women. All those
disciples must have been with Jesus just in order to get into paradise.
It is always good to have good contacts, and you can't find a better
contact than the contact with the only begotten son of God. Just behind
him they will also be able to enter through the gates of paradise. Their
disciplehood was a kind of exploitation of Jesus; hence there was no
courage. It was cunning and clever, but not courageous.</p><p>Only love can be courageous.</p><p>You are asking about aloneness and courage. Courage comes out of
love... Do you love yourself? Do you love this existence? Do you love
this beautiful life which is a gift? It has been given to you without
your being even ready for it, without your deserving it, without your
being worthy of it.</p><p>If you love this existence which has given life to you, which goes on
providing every moment life and nourishment to you, you will find
courage. And this courage will help you to stand alone like a cedar of
Lebanon, high -- reaching to the stars but alone.</p><p>In aloneness you will disappear as an ego and personality and you
will find yourself as life itself, deathless and eternal. Unless you are
capable of being</p><p>alone your search for truth will remain a failure. Your aloneness is
your truth.</p><p>Your aloneness is your divineness.</p><p>The function of the master is to help you to stand alone. Meditation
is just a strategy to take away your personality, your thoughts, your
mind, your identity with the body, and leave you absolutely alone
inside, just a living fire. And once you have found your living fire,
you will know all the joys and all the ecstasies that human
consciousness is capable of.</p><p>The old woman watched her grandson eat his soup with the wrong spoon,
grasp his knife by the wrong end, eat the main course with his hands,
and pour tea into the saucer and blow on it.</p><p>"Has not watching your mother and father at the dinner table taught
you anything?" she asked.</p><p>"Yes," said the boy, chewing with his mouth open, "never to get
married." He has learned a great lesson: Remain alone.</p><p>It is really very difficult to be with others, but we are accustomed
from our very birth to be with others. It may be miserable, it may be a
suffering, it may be a torture but we are accustomed; at least it is
well known.</p><p>One is afraid to step into the darkness beyond the territory, but
unless you go beyond the territory of the collective mask, you cannot
find yourself.</p><p>Groucho Marx has made a beautiful statement for you to remember: "I
find television very educating. Every time somebody turns on the set I
go into the other room and read a book."</p><p>The teacher of a class of ten-year-olds is too shy to conduct the
sex-education class and so she asks her class to make this a homework
project.</p><p>Little Hymie asks his father who mumbles something about a stork. His
grandmother said he came from a cabbage patch and his great-grandmother
blushes and whispers that children come from the great ocean of
existence.</p><p>The next day, little Hymie is called by the teacher to report on his
project. Little Hymie says to the teacher, "I'm afraid there is
something wrong in our family. Apparently nobody has made love for three
generations!"</p><p>In fact, very few people have loved at all; they have pretended, have
been hypocrites deceiving not only others but have deceived themselves
too.</p><p>You can love authentically only when you are.</p><p>Right now you are only a part of a crowd, a cog in the wheel. How can
you love?</p><p>--</p><p>because you are not. First be; first know yourself.</p><p>In your aloneness you will discover what it is to be. And out of that
awareness of your being love flows, and much more.</p><p>Aloneness should be your only search.</p><p>And it does not mean that you have to go to the mountains, you can be
alone in the marketplace. It is simply a question of being aware, alert,
watchful, remembering that you are only your watchfulness. Then you are
alone wherever you are. You may be in the crowd, you may be in the
mountains; it makes no difference, you are just the same watchfulness.
In the crowd you watch the crowd; in the mountains you watch the
mountains. With open eyes you watch existence; with closed eyes you
watch yourself.</p><p>You are only one thing: the watcher.</p><p>And this watcher is the greatest realization. This is your buddha
nature; this is your nature of enlightenment, of your awakening. This
should be your only discipline. Only this makes you a disciple: this
discipline of knowing your aloneness. Otherwise, what makes you a
disciple? You have been deceived on every point in life. You have been
told that to believe in a master makes you a disciple. That is
absolutely wrong; otherwise, everybody in the world is a disciple.</p><p>Somebody believes in Jesus, somebody believes in Buddha, somebody
believes in Krishna, somebody believes in Mahavira; everybody believes
in somebody but nobody is a disciple, because to be a disciple does not
mean to believe in a</p><p>master. To be a disciple means to learn the discipline of being your
self, of being your true self.</p><p>In that experience is hidden the very treasure of life. In that
experience you become for the first time an emperor; otherwise you will
remain a beggar in the crowd. There are two kinds of beggars: poor
beggars and rich beggars, but they are all beggars. Even your kings and
your queens are beggars.</p><p>Only those people, very few people who have stood alone in their
being, in their clarity, in their light, who have found their own light,
who have found their own flowering, who have found their own space they
can call their home, their eternal home -- those few people are the
emperors. This whole universe is their empire. They don't need to
conquer it; it is already conquered.</p><p>By knowing oneself you have conquered it. Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Osho. The Invitation Chapter #24</p><p>Chapter title: Virtue is the currency of heaven</p><p>2 September 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium Archive</p><p>code: 8709020</p><p>ShortTitle: INVITA24</p><p>Audio: Yes</p><p>Video:</p><p>Yes Length:</p><p>116</p><p>mins Question 1</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>HOW IS IT THAT GOING INTO SOMETHING CONSCIOUSLY HAS SUCH A POWER TO
REVEAL ALL THE THREADS WHICH MAKE UP THE TANGLE?</p><p>Devageet, the reality is just the opposite. All our tangles in life
are created by our unconsciousness, so the moment you become conscious
those tangles disappear. It is not the power of consciousness that makes
them disappear. It is the power of unconsciousness that creates
them.</p><p>All the tangles of life, of love, of relationship are created by our
unconsciousness. We don't know what we are doing, and by the time we
become aware it is too late. What has been done cannot be undone. Our
unconsciousness is very supportive to the ego -- they have a
co-existence. Coming of consciousness will not only disperse all the
tangles, it will also disperse you as an ego. It is a very complicated
and complex phenomenon.</p><p>In your unconsciousness you do something. It is almost certain that
once you have done something wrong that has created misery in you,
around you, you will come to your senses. But you cannot undo it because
the ego comes in between. You cannot even say,</p><p>"I am sorry." Just a simple apology may disperse the tangle but the
ego won't allow even that. And you are almost a victim; you are not
doing things. Your unconsciousness, your unawareness goes on forcing you
to do things.</p><p>Just last night I answered Prem Shunyo's question very lightly and
very lovingly</p><p>and very joyously. I joked about it, but she was pissed off -- I
could see her face. Milarepa was angry.</p><p>You don't know what you are doing. What you are doing is almost
beyond your hands; you are reacting. If Prem Shunyo had heard what I was
saying... I was simply saying,</p><p>"Don't take it seriously." I was laughing about it, but she could not
laugh. You all laughed because it was not your problem. The more you
laughed the more you made her serious.</p><p>In each person's life the time of change comes. And one of the
greatest things to remember is that when you change a certain pattern of
life, you have to change naturally.</p><p>It is not in your hands. Biology makes you capable of sex at the age
of thirteen or fourteen; it is not your doing.</p><p>At a certain age, as you are coming closer to forty or forty-two, the
biology's purpose is finished. All those hormones that have been
propelling you are disappearing. To accept this change is very
difficult. You suddenly start thinking as if you are no longer
beautiful, that you need a face-lift.</p><p>I have heard about a woman who was saying to the plastic surgeon, "I
need a face-lift."</p><p>The surgeon looked at her and he said, "There is nothing wrong; it is
just age. Don't be worried about it. Why unnecessarily go to the
trouble? But the woman was insistent, so the doctor said, "Okay, but it
will cost five thousand dollars."</p><p>The woman said, "That much money I don't have. Can't you suggest
something cheaper?"</p><p>The doctor said, "Yes. You can purchase a veil."</p><p>It is one of the Western problems. In the East no woman is worried.
Things are accepted as they come. Acceptance has been the basic
foundation of Eastern life. The West is continuously imposing on nature,
demanding how things should be. Nobody wants to become old, so when the
time of transition from one stage of life comes, a very strange
phenomenon happens -- and that is what is happening</p><p>to Shunyo. I did not say it because I did not want to hurt her.</p><p>It is going to happen whether I say anything about it or not, just as
a candle comes to the very end, has only a few seconds more before it
will be gone. At the last moment the candle suddenly becomes bigger with
all its power.</p><p>Nobody wants to go.</p><p>It is a well-known fact to medical science that people at the time of
death suddenly become completely healthy; all their diseases disappear.
This is the last effort of their life</p><p>-- to resist death. The people who are related to them feel very
happy that suddenly all diseases have disappeared. The person has become
calm and quiet, but they don't know that it signifies death. The
diseases have disappeared because their function is fulfilled: they have
killed the man. Now it is the last spurt of life.</p><p>The same happens with every biological change in life. When sex is
becoming irrelevant, you start thinking of sex more than ever, and
suddenly a great spurt... That is what is giving her the idea that it
seems she is sexually repressed -- because so much sexuality is suddenly
overwhelming the mind.</p><p>The mind can only understand logically, rationally one thing: from
where is this sexuality coming? -- it must be coming from the repressed
unconscious. That is what Sigmund Freud and their followers have been
teaching to the whole world. They are right on many points; they are
wrong on many points. Particularly about this point, the transition when
you are no longer young and the hormones in you are going to disappear,
and the interest in sex is going to die -- before dying it will explode
with its full force.</p><p>If you go to a psychoanalyst, he will say that you are sexually
repressed. I cannot say that, because I know that this sudden
overwhelming sexuality will be gone by itself, you don't have to do
anything. It is the signal that life is passing through a change. Now,
life will be more calm and more quiet. You are really entering into a
better state.</p><p>Sex is a little childish. As you become more and more mature, sex
loses the grip over you</p><p>-- and it is a good sign. It is something to be happy about; it is
not a problem to be solved.</p><p>It is something to celebrate.</p><p>In the East no woman ever feels the trouble of the transition from
youth to old age. In fact, she feels immensely happy that now that old
demon is gone and life can be more peaceful. But the West has been
living under many illusions. One is the illusion that there is only one
life. That creates immense trouble. If there is only one life and sex is
disappearing, so you are finished. Now, there is no more opportunity;
there will not be any more excitement in life. Nobody is going to say,
"You are beautiful and I love you and I will love you forever."</p><p>So first, the illusion of one life creates a problem. Second, the
psychoanalysts and other therapists have created another illusion that
sex is almost synonymous to life. The more sexual you are, the more
alive you are. So when sex starts disappearing one starts feeling like a
used cartridge: now there is no point to live; life ends with sex
ending. Then people try all kinds of bizarre things: face lift, plastic
surgery, false breasts. It is stupid, simply stupid. People start trying
wigs; they start trying dresses which are sex-provoking.</p><p>Almost all Western women are starving -- they call it dieting! The
idea in the West is that a woman is beautiful if she is not fat. And
nature has some other idea: the woman has to be a little fat because for
nature the woman is a mother. A mother needs extra fat for the child,
because when the child is in her womb he will need food. And when the
child is in the womb, the mother starts feeling nausea; she cannot eat,
she starts throwing up. She needs emergency fat in her body so she can
feed the child because the child needs food; he is growing fast.</p><p>Science says that in the nine months in the mother's womb, a child
grows so fast that he will never grow so fast again in his seventy
years. In nine months he passes through almost the whole evolution of
man, from the fish... all the stages. His requirements have to be
fulfilled by the mother -- And she cannot eat... you can imagine. It is
troublesome to have a child in your belly. I don't think any man is
ready to be pregnant: he will commit suicide; without any doubt he will
jump from a fifty-storey building, "I am finished...</p><p>pregnant...?"</p><p>Just think, the idea that you have a child in the belly, and you will
go crazy. But how to get rid of it...</p><p>The mother goes through immense suffering, great sacrifice; hence, in
the East we have not created the idea of a skinny woman. Of course, the
skinny woman looks more sexually attractive, younger. The fat woman
looks less sexually interesting, because she loses proportions. Her
waist is no longer very small. Her body has gathered so much fat that
nobody will feel attracted towards her. She does not have the necessary
attraction for the human mind.</p><p>The East has accepted that a woman has to be a little more fat than a
man, a little more rounded.</p><p>Just the other day somebody brought me a book of pictures taken by
one famous photographer and on the front page was Sophia Loren. In the
East she cannot be conceived of as very beautiful: she must be dieting
-- and dieting is nothing but the rich man's idea of starvation.</p><p>The poor people starve by themselves. The rich people starve in a
costly way under professional guidance. The fear that you will not be
attractive, that you will no longer be looked at by people... You will
pass through the street and nobody will look at you; who is
going...?</p><p>It is a great need of man, and particularly women, to have attention
-- attention is nourishment. A woman suffers immensely when nobody pays
attention to her. She has nothing else to attract people by; she has
only her body. Man has not allowed her to have other dimensions where
she can become a famous painter, a dancer or a singer, a learned
professor. Man has cut all other dimensions from the woman's life where
she can be attractive and people will pay respect even while she becomes
old.</p><p>I have to remind you of the meaning of `respect': it means looking
back. When somebody passes by: re-spect. It has nothing to do with
honor; it has something to do with your being suddenly aware that a
beautiful thing has passed.</p><p>Woman is left only the body by man, so she is so much concerned with
the body that it creates clinging, possessiveness, fear that the person
who loves her, if he leaves, perhaps will find another person. And
without attention she starts feeling</p><p>almost dead: What is the use of life if nobody is paying attention to
you? She does not have an intrinsic life of her own.</p><p>Man has taught woman that her life depends on others' opinions about
her. You can see all over the world that beauty competitions are
arranged only for women, and the woman does not even revolt against
these ideas. Why not for men? Just as you choose a Mrs. or Miss
Universe, choose a Mr. Universe. No, nobody bothers about the man's
body. He can grow fat; he can become a Winston Churchill. Still he
attracts attention because he has power.</p><p>In the same book just beside Sophia Loren is Winston Churchill --
ugly, as fat as you can conceive, the whole face sagging. He needs a
face-lift -- not Sophia Loren -- but he will not bother; there is no
need. He can have power, he can be the prime minister. He can be this
and he can be that...</p><p>Man has managed over the centuries to have all the other dimensions
of attracting people, and he has left to woman only one dimension: her
body. He has made woman just a vegetable. And naturally, the vegetable
starts being worried if there are no customers.</p><p>It is not a coincidence that in the most sexually perverted country,
France, while being in love with a woman, you say, "I want to eat you."
Are these people cannibals? Is the woman a vegetable or what? "I want to
eat you" shows a great respect for the woman!</p><p>When nobody says to her, "I want to eat you," she thinks, "I am now
finished. Life has come to an end!"</p><p>But here with me you have to learn something. The first thing is a
deep acceptability of all the changes that nature brings to you. Youth
has its own beauty; old age has its own beauty too. It may not be
sexual, but if a man has lived silently, peacefully, meditatively, then
old age will have a grandeur of its own.</p><p>Just as the snow-covered peaks look beautiful, the white hairs of old
age also have their own beauty -- and not only beauty, but wisdom too,
which no young man can claim, because all his behavior is stupid. He is
running behind this woman, running behind that woman.</p><p>The old man has stopped all this running business. He has settled in
himself. He</p><p>is no longer dependent on anybody else. The old woman should follow
the same way. There should be no difference between men and women.</p><p>That is why I was simply laughing and joking about Prem Shunyo's
question because I did not want her to become serious about something
which is natural. And if Milarepa feels angry, he simply proves what I
have been saying, that he is crazy.</p><p>Now he is running after younger women. This shows that you are not
maturing, not learning that what you call love is not love, but
biological slavery. Love happens only when you are beyond biological
slavery; then love has a beauty. Biological slavery and the biological
relationship are so ugly that for centuries people have decided to make
love in darkness without light, so they don't see what they are
doing.</p><p>Particularly the woman is very sensitive when you make love to her;
she immediately closes her eyes. Just to see this nasty thing that is
happening...</p><p>I have heard that when Henry Ford died he was received with a great
welcome in heaven and even God thanked him: "You have done great service
to humanity by creating so many cars -- you are a great creator."</p><p>Henry Ford said, "That's okay, but you are not that great a creator.
You have put man's body in such a stupid way that the loveliest part
people think about, dream about is so close to the dirtiest part. Could
you not find somewhere else in the whole body?</p><p>Why has love to be sandwiched between the ugliest parts? You don't
have any sense, no aesthetics. The exhaust pipe is so close to the most
lovely part that I cannot believe that you are a great creator" -- and
he was right.</p><p>God has committed many mistakes. This is one of the major mistakes.
The loving part could have been anywhere else: you have a
six-foot-long-body, so much territory! And what kind of a stupid god...
where he puts the loving parts?</p><p>Not only is it to be accepted when life is going through a biological
change, but it has to be rejoiced that you have passed over all that
stupidity, that now you are free from biological bondage; it is only a
question of conditioning.</p><p>When you ask me questions you should remember that I never in any way
want</p><p>to hurt you. Even sometimes if I have to avoid the truth, I avoid it
but don't hurt you. If you get hurt about something that must be your
own mind. But perhaps you are just a victim in that too -- it is
unconscious.</p><p>Devageet, you are asking, "How is it that going into something
consciously has such a power to reveal all the threads which make up the
tangle?"</p><p>They have been made in your unconsciousness. They have been made in
the darkness of your being. And when you bring light, naturally you see
all the tangle: how you have created your misery, your suffering, your
anguish, yourself. Seeing it is enough -- all those tangles
disappear.</p><p>A conscious man never creates any tangle; he lives more intensely
than anybody else. But his life is without any tangles for the simple
reason that in consciousness you cannot create tangles.</p><p>Abbie's wife had just died and he was standing over the grave and
sobbing uncontrollably. His best friend put his arm around him and said,
"Abbie, time is a wonderful thing. Believe it or not some day you will
want to start a new life again and be with people, maybe even get
married again. Listen to me: Time heals wounds."</p><p>Abbie looked at him and replied, "I know, I know... but what am I
going to do tonight?"</p><p>Such is the unconsciousness of man. The wife died in the morning and
he is worried about what he is going to do in the night -- tonight! And
you are talking about time: that some day wounds will be healed. What
about tonight?</p><p>I have heard an ancient story, Arabic, that a man's father died and
all the old people of the neighborhood came and said, "Don't be worried,
son. If you have lost your father, we are here. Don't think for a single
moment that you are fatherless. We are all your fathers. You can come
always to us in any difficulty, any problem."</p><p>He was very much consoled, seeing the concern of his neighborhood
people. He had never thought that they would be so considerate.</p><p>And then his mother died and all the old women came and said, "Don't
be worried. We are still alive. You can look at us as your mother and
whatever your</p><p>mother was doing for you, we can do. There is no problem about
it."</p><p>He was very much consoled. And then his wife died, and not a single
wife from the neighborhood came to say don't be worried we are here.
Whatever your wife was doing, we will do...!</p><p>The man was very angry. He stood in front of his house, watching if
anybody would come or not -- and nobody came. Finally, he started
shouting, "You nasty people. When my father died all the old people
came. When my mother died all the old women came.</p><p>And now my wife has died and no young woman is coming -- what kind of
neighborhood is this?</p><p>"... absurd, illogical! I am waiting from the morning for somebody to
turn up, but nobody has come."</p><p>One has to accept life. But your unconsciousness does not allow you
to accept life as it is.</p><p>You wanted something else.</p><p>It is perfectly good when sex disappears. You will be more capable of
meditating. You will be more capable of being alone. You will be more
capable of being blissful, without any misery because the whole game of
sex is nothing but a long misery -- fighting, hate, jealousy, envy. It
is not a peaceful life.</p><p>It is peace, silence, blissfulness, aloneness, freedom which give you
the real taste of what life is.</p><p>Two women are talking in a tearoom at four o'clock over two large,
gooey ice cream sundaes and little sugary cakes. They have not seen each
other since high school days and one is bragging about her very
advantageous marriage.</p><p>"My husband buys me whole new sets of diamonds when the ones I have
get dirty," she says, "and I have never even bothered to clean
them."</p><p>"Fantastic," said the other woman.</p><p>"Yes," says the first, "we get a new car every two months."</p><p>"Fantastic," says the other.</p><p>"And our house..." pursues the first woman, "Well, what is the use of
talking about it, it is just..."</p><p>"Fantastic," finishes the other.</p><p>"Yes, and tell me, what are you doing nowadays?" asked the first
woman. "I go to the charm school," says the other.</p><p>"Charm school! Why, how quaint. What do you learn there?" "Well, we
learn to say, fantastic, instead of bullshit."</p><p>In your unconsciousness everything is bullshit. And when you become
conscious, it is really fantastic: all tangles disappear, all problems
disappear. But you need not go to a charm school to learn it, because in
a charm school deep down the woman is saying,</p><p>"Bullshit."</p><p>And she is just repeating like a parrot, "Fantastic," but she means
bullshit. Not in a charm school, but in a school where your
unconsciousness slowly, slowly disappears leaving a luminous being
within you -- then there is no tangle in life.</p><p>I have lived a very strange life. Anybody else would have found so
many tangles in it, so many troubles. I have also passed through all
kinds of tangles, troubles, problems, but I have remained unscratched; I
have enjoyed the journey. Whatever life brought to me, I have enjoyed
it. I have tried to make the best out of it, whatever it is.</p><p>There is no point in crying and weeping over spilled milk. Any
situation can be made a learning, a step towards maturity, can be turned
into a beneficial opportunity. That is what I call intelligence;
otherwise, what is the difference between intelligent people and
unintelligent people.</p><p>Devageet, it is true consciousness has tremendous power, but it is
not used in revealing and dispersing the tangles of your life; they
simply disappear as you become conscious.</p><p>Gautam Buddha used to say that when the lights are on and from the
windows people can see that the master is awake, thieves don't come
close. When the lights are put off, only then do thieves come close to
the house to see whether the master has gone to sleep and it is the
right time to enter. He was saying this about consciousness. He used to
call sex, greed, lust for power, position, respectability all thieves.
They come to you only when they see that there is no light in the man;
inside it is all dark.</p><p>Once you are radiating consciousness and light, those thieves don't
come close to you.</p><p>But consciousness has its own power. It is simply in the presence of
consciousness that tangles disappear. The power is not used for
dispersing the tangles and problems; the power is to bring blissfulness.
The power is to bring peace, silence, at homeness, at easeness and a
tremendous ecstasy, a divine drunkenness.</p><p>Life becomes for the first time self-oriented; you don't have to beg
from others for anything. Nobody can give you blissfulness; nobody can
give you ecstasy. Nobody can give you the sense of immortality and the
dance that comes with it. Nobody can give you the silence, which becomes
a song in your heart.</p><p>What can people give to you? In fact, the power of consciousness
gives you so much that you become capable of sharing with people. For
the first time, you can give to people.</p><p>They are living in darkness; they haven't seen any light. They don't
have any idea what a conscious being is. They don't have any conception,
comprehension of the power of consciousness, how many flowers shower,
how much fragrance becomes natural to you.</p><p>You can give, and you can give them a taste and you can give them a
direction, so they can also find the same power which is dormant in
them.</p><p>A conscious man awakened can help millions of people to move towards
the source of joy, real and authentic life, to pure love which knows
nothing of hate, which knows nothing of jealousy, which has nothing to
do with body and biology -- which is just a spiritual communion, a
feeling of deep compassion for your innermost being.</p><p>Yes, the power of consciousness gives you many things. The treasure
is inexhaustible, but your problems and tangles that have been created
by unconsciousness -- for them no power is needed, just the presence of
consciousness is enough.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT VIRTUE?</p><p>Fantastic! Here, we are not concerned about virtue at all. Virtue is
for people who are unconscious; it is a training for them to say, "Don't
say bullshit, say fantastic!"</p><p>Virtue is a training a discipline imposed on unconscious people. All
the religions talk about virtue as being against sin. They have made
fixed categories. Some things are condemned as sin and some things are
praised as virtues. The virtuous man will have immense reward after
death, and the sinner will be condemned to hellfire for eternity.</p><p>This is the strategy of fear and greed, because man can be easily
manipulated by these two things -- fear and greed. Heaven is nothing but
greed exaggerated; so hell is fear exaggerated, and human beings are
afraid of eternal hellfire. Out of fear they somehow try to avoid
whatever is sin. And the trouble is anything that gives you joy,
anything that gives you pleasure is sin.</p><p>Out of fear they lose all contact with life, they become dry and dead
before their death.</p><p>There is only one consolation: that they are declared saints, they
are worshipped. Just their ego is satisfied greatly; otherwise they are
suffering deep down immensely.</p><p>That is why your saints cannot laugh: laughter needs a little juice.
There is no juice in them; everything is dry. They are deserts where
nothing grows green. So on the one hand the pressure of fear...</p><p>I have seen pictures of the Middle Ages: there were Christian
preachers who made so much fuss about hell and its tortures that just to
be in the church</p><p>listening to their sermons many ladies used to faint. Just the idea
that they were going into such detail...</p><p>what would be done to you? The people thought the preachers were
great according to how much they could infect people's psychologies. The
greatest preacher was one in whose congregation almost everybody
fainted.</p><p>A deep fear psychology, a deep guilt psychology on the one hand, and
on the other hand greed to be fulfilled as a reward. You will be getting
everything in paradise: all those things which are sins here on the
earth, they will also be available to you.</p><p>Mohammedans are against alcohol, but in their paradise there are
rivers of alcohol. You don't have to go to a small pub, you can drink,
you can drown, you can swim. All the rivers, they don't consist of water
-- pure wine. Here it is condemned: you should not fall in the trap of
love. A woman is condemned and in the heaven -- in every religion's idea
of heaven -- women are freely supplied. Of course, according to your
virtue you will get. If your virtue is great perhaps, Sophia Loren -- it
all depends on your virtue.</p><p>A strange game has been played with the human mind. Thousands of
girls... I say girls, because they don't grow in age. They don't have to
feel like Prem Shunyo; they are fixed for eternity at the age sixteen.
In fact, they are prostitutes, eternal prostitutes, but they are thought
to be rewards for saints. How many other saints have used those rewards,
because since the beginning the same staff has been working, not even a
shift change. I have never come across anything about a shift change or
any staff change in the holy scriptures -- the same young women.</p><p>They remain always young. They don't perspire; they do not need
deodorants. They must be certainly made of plastic, because only plastic
does not perspire. A real skin is bound to perspire if it is alive,
because through every pore of the skin you are breathing in. And
perspiration is a natural way of keeping you at the same body
temperature.</p><p>If it is too cold you start shivering. You may not be aware why you
are shivering. You think it is because of the cold; it is to keep your
body temperature continuously the same.</p><p>Shivering gives you inner heat. In the hot season you perspire. You
perspire so that your water, perspiration is taken away by the heat; it
evaporates so the heat</p><p>does not affect your temperature. It simply evaporates your
perspiration. It leaves you without increasing your temperature;
otherwise, if there was no perspiration, your life span would not be
very big.</p><p>The life span can be measured in many ways: in years, seventy years,
but as body temperature from ninety-eight to one hundred and ten -- just
twelve degrees is your span of life. If there was no perspiration, your
temperature would be as high as the heat is around you. The moment you
pass one hundred and five, you would start getting dizzy.</p><p>The moment you pass one hundred and seven, you would be falling into
a coma. The moment you pass one hundred and ten, you would have passed
away.</p><p>It is perspiration that saves you; it is your life savior. But those
poor plastic girls... and eternal promise for all joys!</p><p>The Hindu heaven has certain trees, which they call kalpavriksha,
wish- fulfillment trees.</p><p>You don't have to order a cup of tea or a woman or a car; you don't
have to order anybody; you don't have to call any bearer or give a call
to some agency. You just sit under the wish-fulfilling tree -- and they
are all over heaven, everywhere</p><p>-- you just sit underneath and you say whatever you want, and
immediately, instantly, it will be provided.</p><p>There is a beautiful story of a man, who by some accident stumbled
into heaven. He had no idea where he had reached. He was sitting under a
kalpavriksha. He was feeling very hungry. He had been traveling a lot
and that is how he had stumbled somehow by accident into heaven.</p><p>He said, "I am feeling hungry but I don't see any hotel anywhere, any
restaurant, nothing.</p><p>I don't see even a single man. But I am feeling very hungry, if I
could get some good food... Immediately beautiful women appeared from
nowhere with all kinds of sweets and delicious foods. He was so hungry
that he did not pay attention to where all these things were coming
from.</p><p>He started eating, feeling perfectly well. He was tired. He went to
sleep. Before going to sleep, he thought that sleeping on the ground,
uneven with stones, if</p><p>someone could arrange just a mattress, and suddenly -- he could not
believe -- again beautiful women appeared with a beautiful bed and they
put him on the bed. But he was so tired that he still did not think what
was going on.</p><p>When refreshed, he awoke. He thought, my God, there is nobody here
who has brought the food, and I have not said to anybody; I just thought
about it! And he looked at the beautiful bed, "Who has brought this? I
had simply thought about lying down on the ground. It seems there must
be ghosts around." That was the natural conclusion, because he was not
aware that he was in heaven, under a kalpavriksha.</p><p>"There must be ghosts all around, my God" -- and immediately ghosts
appeared, because whatever you would say... The moment he saw the
skeletons of ghosts dancing all around, he said, "My god, they are going
to kill me" -- and they killed him. The man never came back.</p><p>Religions have used fear to prevent you from living, and greed to
help you so that you can be patient and hope that great things are
ahead. Just the small things you are leaving, and for eternity you will
enjoy all the pleasures that you want -- and you don't have to pay for
them.</p><p>Virtue is the currency of heaven.</p><p>The more virtuous you are, the bigger a bank balance you have in
heaven. I don't teach you virtue because your virtue is false, because
deep down there is greed.</p><p>I teach you only awareness.</p><p>Out of awareness whatever you do is virtue according to me. And out
of unawareness whatever you do is sin according to me. And according to
me, your sins are not going to take you to hell. Your sins immediately
give you hell -- here, just now. And your virtues are not going to give
you an eternity of paradise. Your virtues give you joy, blissfulness,
the moment you act with full awareness.</p><p>The punishment and the reward is immediate: the reward follows your
action. But it depends where your action will lead you. It can be
unconscious action, then hell herenow.</p><p>It has nothing to do with geography; it is something to do with your
psychology.</p><p>Acting consciously, you are in paradise wherever you are. Once you
have learned, you will not ask, "What is virtue?" You will ask, "What is
awareness? What is consciousness?" You will ask, "What is meditation?"
-- because that is going to make you conscious and make you alert.</p><p>What brings misery is sin. Whatever brings joy is virtue.</p><p>Alfred North Whitehead has made a beautiful statement: It requires a
very unusual mind to make an analysis of the obvious.</p><p>To me, it is absolutely obvious that virtue or sin, heaven or hell
are secondary. The primary is your alertness, your awareness, but people
won't ask the obvious. These are by-products, and by getting entangled
with by-products you will be in trouble.</p><p>There is a tale concerning Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson on board
a train...</p><p>They passed a flock of sheep and Watson said, "A sizable flock,
Holmes."</p><p>"Ah, exactly seven hundred and eighty-four in number, my dear
Watson," said Holmes sleepily.</p><p>"Good heavens, Holmes," said Watson. "Surely you can't have counted
them."</p><p>They are in a train; the train has passed the sheep. The flock is
left far behind and it must have taken a single moment to pass.</p><p>"Not directly," said Holmes. "I made use of a simple trick any school
child knows. I merely counted the legs and divided by four."</p><p>Just don't get into nonsense; otherwise, you will always feel what
Leonardo da Vinci has confessed in his letters: I have offended God and
mankind because my work did not reach the quality it should have. Now,
Leonardo da Vinci is one of the greatest geniuses, and whatever he has
done is incomparable. There is nobody else who even comes close to him.
But even such a great man feels a little guilt, "I have not reached the
quality it should have."</p><p>This is the atmosphere that religions have created in the world. They
don't allow anybody to be at ease, even the greatest genius. They go on
telling you that you are still not doing right; you are still far away
from the goal. You are still unworthy; you are always unworthy. They
will not leave you at peace so that you can enjoy life and love life and
be grateful to God, and be grateful to the universe -- which both mean
the same to me.</p><p>God is not a person. It is this whole universe -- these trees, these
clouds, the sun, the stars, you and everybody, whether asleep or awake,
whether committing sins or virtues, you are part of one organic
universe.</p><p>If you commit a sin... The word `sin' has been contaminated by the
religions; otherwise it simply means in its roots, forgetfulness,
unawareness. It means exactly what I am saying to you. Sin is your
unawareness. Any action done in unconsciousness is sin. But religions
have completely destroyed the original meaning of the word. Whatever you
are doing consciously is virtue and there is no ready-made list of what
are virtues, because in a different situation, the same thing may become
sin. The thing that was virtue in one condition, in one context, may not
be virtue in another context; it all depends. But how are you going to
know whether in this context it is virtue or sin.</p><p>Those dead categories that have been given to you like the ten
commandments, fixed forever, they don't take account of the fact that
life is continuously changing and you are moving every moment into a new
situation -- and a new situation needs a new response.</p><p>So I don't give you, I can't give you any ready-made list to avoid
these things, that these are sins and avoid them because they will lead
you to hell. I cannot exploit you and your fears and I cannot say to you
that these are the commandments, if you follow them yours is the kingdom
of God, because in life things go on changing.</p><p>It happened...</p><p>I had a friend; he was a professor in the university -- a very
learned professor of Sanskrit.</p><p>He wanted to go to Tibet because many scriptures in Sanskrit on
Buddhism had been burned by the Hindus in India. But their translations
exist in Tibetan still, so he wanted to translate them back into
Sanskrit.</p><p>It was a great idea and he was well versed in Sanskrit. He had been
learning Tibetan for years and now he was ready. But he was a brahmin by
caste, a very orthodox brahmin.</p><p>In India it is perfectly good to get up at five o'clock, early in the
morning and have a good bath in the nearby lake or in the nearby river,
and then do your prayer, meditate. Only after that can you enter into
the mundane world of your profession, your life, your family.</p><p>In Tibet, the Tibetan holy book says that only one bath a year is
allowed; Tibetan monks are the dirtiest people to find. I have been
harassed by Tibetan monks.</p><p>When the Dalai Lama came for the first time -- escaped from Tibet
with thousands of Lamas -- I was taking a camp in Bodhgaya and all the
Lamas first came to pay respect to the place where Gautam Buddha had
become enlightened. I was taking a camp just there in the compound of
the memorial temple for Buddha. I had never come across Tibetan Lamas.
But such are habits, they die very hard. They use, I think three or four
layers of clothes, one on top of another. Their clothes are greasy,
dusty and they will not take any bath because their holy scripture says
once in a year is compulsory.</p><p>When my friend reached Tibet, he continued to follow his pattern of
life in India. He could not manage to be there more than three days,
because he had to take a bath early in the morning, five o'clock,
according to the brahmin religion. Without taking a bath you cannot eat;
that is a sin -- and in India it is certainly right. But in Tibet the
whole context is different. To take a bath in ice-cold water, five
o'clock in the early morning is to freeze yourself to death. Food is not
a problem. You will not be able to eat food. In three days he got so
tortured by this morning bath.</p><p>One day he tried; it was too much. The whole day he was feeling as if
his blood was frozen. And for another two days he could not eat because
he could not take the bath. So he had taken only one bath in Tibet and
one day he had eaten and two days he remained without food. But he
thought, How long will it be because I cannot survive without food,
neither can I survive with the bath. It is better to go home, forget all
about those scriptures; it is none of my business.</p><p>He came back. I was surprised when I saw him back "... so quick you
managed to translate."</p><p>He said, "Forget all about translations. Congratulate me that I am
alive." And when he told me I said that this is stupidity.</p><p>In Tibet you should look at the context, not at your Hindu idea of
virtue and sin -</p><p>- that is stupidity. Mohammedans have been allowed by their founder,
Mohammed, four wives, and it is perfectly virtuous to have four
wives.</p><p>Mohammed himself married nine wives. Obviously he was a prophet, no
ordinary man, but, it was perfectly right in those times because the
Arabs were continuously fighting and killing. But only men were killed;
it was against their culture to kill any woman. The women were raped,
but not killed.</p><p>So there was a strange situation; there were four times more women
than men. If he had insisted that monogamy was virtue, as is being
insisted all over the world</p><p>-- polygamy or even bigamy is a crime, is a sin -- he would not have
been right. Because if monogamy had been virtuous, what would have
happened to the three women who are left without men? They would corrupt
the whole of society. They will become prostitutes and the whole society
would become an ugly scene. So Mohammed is perfectly right; I support
him.</p><p>But not now in India, where women and men are equal as they are
everywhere, nature keeps a balance, an exact balance. To keep the
balance nature has to take care: it gives birth to one hundred and
fifteen boys when it gives birth to one hundred girls, because fifteen
boys will pop off before the time of marriage -- boys are weak and
fragile.</p><p>The ordinary idea that women are weak and fragile is just male
chauvinistic imposition.</p><p>Nature knows better: fifteen boys per hundred are going to die. Girls
don't die; they have a greater resistance against diseases. They are not
so often sick and they live longer than men, five years longer all over
the world.</p><p>So by the time the marriageable age comes, there are a hundred boys
and a hundred girls.</p><p>Monogamy seems to be absolutely right in this context, but
Mohammedans go on insisting that it is part of their religion... So even
in India they are allowed to have four wives. It is such an ugly
situation because it means three men will remain without wives.</p><p>So the Mohammedans abduct women from other religions.</p><p>Hindus particularly are very touchy people. If a woman has been
forcibly taken by the Mohammedans to their homes, even if they have not
touched her she will not be accepted back in the Hindu fold, she has to
go to the Mohammedans. She has fallen below the dignity of a Hindu.</p><p>So Mohammedans have been continually stealing women from other
societies. They have to, because what to do with the three men that are
without women? Those three men will start relationships with others'
wives and that will create a mess. And the Indian constitution, which,
in the name of religion, doesn't want to interfere in any religion,
cannot do anything to prevent Mohammedans from this polygamy. And those
four women that they marry, they use as economic, financial help; they
work and the husband rests. This is great!</p><p>The Mohammedan priests go on insisting on no interference, because a
man with four women can create four children per year, very easily, but
a woman with four men cannot create four children; she will create only
one child. The population of Mohammedans goes on increasing as nobody
else can increase the population the way they can. So you will not be
surprised that India has been divided; Mohammedans have taken Pakistan
and made it separate. The country has been cut into three parts: one
side is Pakistan, given to Mohammedans; another side is Bangladesh,
given to Mohammedans. And still, within forty years, in India
Mohammedans are again number two to Hindus.</p><p>Again they can ask for another country. And you will also be
surprised that India is a Hindu country but the number of Mohammedans in
India is more than in any Mohammedan country in the world -- not even
Arabia, or Egypt, or Iran, or Libya, or Palestine... No Mohammedan
country has so many Mohammedans as India has.</p><p>India is the greatest Mohammedan country in the world if you take the
number of the Mohammedans. And the number goes on growing four times
more. Hindus are simply puzzled what to do because soon they will be
outnumbering Hindus. They have taken Pakistan, they have taken
Bangladesh, and it is not far away when they will be the majority and
Hindus will become the minority in their own country.</p><p>Situations, contexts should be taken into account and that is
possible only if you</p><p>are living a very alert and conscious life; otherwise you will follow
dead, ready- made things which may have been relevant at some time.
Those times have changed and they have become irrelevant, but the list
continues to be the same.</p><p>So I don't give you any list. I have been asked by priests, Hindus,
Mohammedans, Christians, that I should make a clear-cut statement: what
are sins, what are virtues and what are my fundamental principles of
religion?</p><p>I said, "My first fundamental and the last fundamental is that
religion cannot be a fixed thing. It has to be spontaneous. It has to
come out of your awareness. Nobody can decide it. No catechism can be
given according to me.</p><p>I can only teach you awareness and then you find out with your
awareness, with your own light where to go, what to do.</p><p>Anything done with awareness is virtue. Anything done with
unawareness is sin. Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Osho. The Invitation Chapter #25</p><p>Chapter title: Just go and tell everybody</p><p>2 September 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium Archive</p><p>code: 8709025</p><p>ShortTitle: INVITA25</p><p>Audio:</p><p>Yes Video:</p><p>Yes Length:</p><p>103</p><p>mins Question 1</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>SINCE MY ARRIVAL HERE I HAVE BEEN LIVING INTENSELY, AND I SEE</p><p>THAT THE PRESENT IS ONLY POETRY.</p><p>I THANK YOU DEEPLY FOR YOUR BEING HERE WITH US. I AM LEAVING IN</p><p>A FEW DAYS AND I FEEL THAT YOU WILL BE EVERYWHERE I GO, BUT I AM</p><p>SCARED OF THE NOISE OF THE WORLD. I DO NOT WANT TO LOSE MYSELF</p><p>THERE.</p><p>CAN YOU TELL ME SOMETHING?</p><p>Dhyan Giovanna, once you have tasted the inner silence, the noise on
the outside does not matter; it is not a disturbance at all. The only
disturbance comes from your inner noise, the chattering noise inside,
the continuous rush of thoughts -- that is the real marketplace. What is
outside, is outside; you can pass through the marketplace in absolute
silence. If your inner being is not disturbed, then what is</p><p>happening outside cannot have any impact on you.</p><p>The fear arises only because we are not certain of our own silence --
our silence is very vulnerable. And in the beginning, it is natural --
it is nothing to be worried about. All that is needed is that the inner
silence should be more crystallized. In fact, going into the outer world
can be of immense help because it becomes a test. Use it as an
opportunity to test your silence. And once you start feeling silent in
the crowd, then you will be overjoyed --</p><p>then you can be certain that this silence is yours; otherwise
sometimes one is deceived.</p><p>In the mountains you can be silent, in the deep forest you can be
silent, in the middle of the night under the stars you can be silent --
but that is not your silence. It is just the outer silence penetrating
you. In fact, there is no difference -</p><p>- outer silence penetrating you, or outer noise penetrating you --
both are the same; you are under the impact of the outside.</p><p>Hence I don't give any value to the silence that you feel coming from
the outside. This silence will not be much help; when noise comes, you
will be overwhelmed by the noise.</p><p>The silence has not to be of the mountains, of the stars, of the
silence of the deep night, nor the silence of this commune. Here
everybody is silent -- at least, trying to be silent!</p><p>With so many people trying to be silent, one can just become part...
But it is the same: you can become part of a commune and feel silent; in
the crowd you can become part of the crowd and you will feel noisy. In
fact, you are not yet. All your experiences are dependent; you don't
exist as an individual. That is the fear; otherwise it does not
matter.</p><p>I used to have a friend who was condemned in the whole city -- he was
a thief, and you can say he was a master thief. For almost six months he
would be in jail, and six months outside. Nobody in the city even wanted
to talk to him.</p><p>From the jail he used to come directly to my house. He was a very
lovable man. And whenever he would come from the jail to my house,
naturally everybody in the family was disturbed. My father again and
again insisted to me that this friendship was not good.</p><p>I said, "Why do you believe in him and not in me? Am I your son, or
is he your son?"</p><p>And he said, "What kind of argument are you giving me?"</p><p>I said, "I am saying exactly the right thing. You don't believe in
me, you believe in him.</p><p>You are afraid I will be affected by him -- you are not giving even a
single thought that I may affect him. Why do you think I am so
weak?"</p><p>He said, "I have never thought from this angle -- perhaps you are
right."</p><p>Slowly, slowly that man became accepted by my family. It took a
little time; there were many reasons for them to reject him. The first
reason was that he was a Mohammedan; second, he was a thief.</p><p>I had to sit outside the dining room because they would not allow him
in the dining room.</p><p>In a Jaina family, no Mohammedan can be allowed in the dining room.
Even for guests or customers, separate plates, glasses, saucers, cups --
everything is kept, but it is kept separate; it is used only for them.
And I insisted that when I invited him for food, I was going to eat with
him -- I could not insult him. He may be a thief, he may be a
Mohammedan, it doesn't matter; I respect his humanity. So the only way
was that I would also have to sit outside the dining room. And my friend
used to say, "Why do you unnecessarily continue to fight with your
family?"</p><p>And slowly, slowly my respect towards him changed him. He was angry
with me, saying,</p><p>"Your respect prevents me from being a thief, and I don't know
anything else. I am uneducated."</p><p>He was an orphan, and there was no other way for him except either to
beg or to steal, and certainly stealing is better than begging. Begging
degrades you very badly; by stealing, at least you are using your
intelligence, your courage.</p><p>He was angry and said, "Now my life has become really a problem, and
you are</p><p>the cause. I cannot steal because I cannot betray your trust, your
love and your respect. And nobody is ready to give me employment."</p><p>So I took him to my father and I said to him, "Now my friend wants
employment. You are against his stealing, now give him employment;
otherwise you will be responsible for his stealing. The poor fellow is
ready to do any work, but nobody in the whole city is ready to give him
work because he is a thief. People say to him, `Bring certificates from
where you have been working. Who has ever employed you ever in your
whole life?' And he has no certificates."</p><p>I told my father, "Listen, somebody has to give him work the first
time; otherwise, how can he get a certificate? You give him employment,
and then you can give him a certificate. And I guarantee that he will
not steal and he will not do anything wrong."</p><p>On my guarantee my father employed him. All other friends of my
father said, "What are you doing, giving a job to a thief? He will
deceive you." But my father said, "My son has given his guarantee, and I
have to give the man an opportunity because my son's reasoning is right:
If nobody gives him an opportunity, then everybody is pushing him
towards the jail. And the whole society is responsible for pushing him
towards the jail.</p><p>He wants to work, but if nobody is willing to give him work.… What do
you want -- that he should commit suicide or what?"</p><p>Once a person goes into jail, then it becomes his only place, his
home. Then within a few days he is back, because there is nobody outside
to give him any protection, any dignity, any respect, any love. It is
better to be in the jail.</p><p>He proved tremendously trustworthy, and finally my father had to
accept. He said, "You are right. I was thinking that I was taking an
unnecessary risk. I had not thought that your reasoning was going to
work. He is a professional thief -- his whole life has been just going
in and out of the jail. But you were right."</p><p>My father was a very sincere man and very truthful; he was always
willing to accept his mistakes, even in front of his own son. He said,
"You were right, that I trusted more in him -- I thought he would spoil
your life. I did not trust that you might transform his life."</p><p>Giovanna, it all depends how much you trust your silence, how much
you trust</p><p>yourself, how much the silence is arising from your inner sources.
Then there is no problem -- you can go in the noisy world and you will
remain silent. And it is possible that you may change a few people you
come in contact with. Why trust that they will be able to change you?
Why accept your weakness?</p><p>Go in the world with courage and with strength, and the noise of the
world will not be a disturbance. And your silence will help people to
become silent. Talk about your experience of meditation to your friends,
to your family. It is always helpful to provoke in people an invitation,
to provoke in people a longing, that they have been missing something
that you have attained. And the more you spread your experience and
share your experience with people, the more you will be protecting
yourself; they will not be able to influence you.</p><p>Start spreading your fragrance and your silence and your experience.
That becomes a subtle protection around you, and that also becomes a
tremendously transforming force.</p><p>Rather than going with fear, go with blissfulness, spreading the
experience that has happened to you.</p><p>You say the present is pure poetry -- that is so valuable; share it.
And trust that the higher value is always victorious. The noise cannot
win over silence, and misery cannot win over blissfulness, and darkness
cannot win over light. These are fundamental rules of existence.</p><p>Just follow these fundamentals and you will be enriched in the
marketplace even more than you can be enriched here. Because there, you
will become stronger -- you will find the challenge to become stronger.
And each time you come, you will come here to refresh yourself, to go
deeper, to find greater peaks of consciousness and then go into the
world.</p><p>Make it a point that the world has not to be renounced. The world
needs people who are silent.</p><p>In the past, the silent people have deserted the world; they have
escaped to the mountains.</p><p>In my opinion, they were cowards and escapists. They have not helped
the world to evolve more, to become more mature, to become more
peaceful; they simply escaped just out of fear that the world would
destroy them.</p><p>I want my people to go into the world and destroy the world's
noisiness, the world's ugliness, greediness. It is a challenge, and it
is very exciting. Always remember: the best defense is attack! Attack
people with your peace, with your love, with your silence, with your joy
-- that's the best defense, and that is a great service to humanity
too.</p><p>Sid Levensky, aged eighty-three, goes into the confessional at Saint
John's Cathedral. The priest asks him, "Have you anything to
confess?"</p><p>"Yes," says the old man, "my wife died two months ago. Two days after
she passed on I met another woman. She is twenty-two years old. I have
been sleeping with her since the day I met her. Sometimes we do it two
or three times a day."</p><p>"And how old are you?" asks the priest. "Eighty-three," Sid
replies.</p><p>"Oh dear!" says the priest, "Go home and say ten Hail Marys." "I
can't do that," says the old man, "I'm Jewish."</p><p>"Then for God's sake, why are you telling me all this?" asks the
priest. "Oh, it's not just you," replies Sid, "I'm telling
everybody!"</p><p>So just go and tell everybody! Question 2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I HAVE BEEN AROUND YOU FOR EIGHT MONTHS NOW, YET I FEEL I RARELY
REALLY LET YOU IN.</p><p>WHAT CAN I DO, OSHO?</p><p>Prem Arpana, as far as I am concerned, I would suggest that you don't
do anything. It is your effort, your desire that is preventing me being
within you because all desire, longing, closes the doors.</p><p>And you are asking, "What can I do?" If you can do nothing, that will
be the best</p><p>-- you just leave this idea. What are you going to do with me inside
you? I am perfectly happy wherever I am! And I can help you from the
outside more easily.</p><p>And this eight months, you say, "I feel I rarely really let you in."
It means sometimes, not really, but you let me in. Why are you engaged
in this unnecessary mind game? There is no need. It happens, but it
happens only when you are not waiting for it; it happens only when you
are not making any effort for it.</p><p>It is one of the most difficult things to understand, that there are
things which happen not by your doing, but by your not doing, your sleep
-- if you make an effort, then it is impossible. People have been doing
all kinds of things: chanting mantras, repeating numbers from one to a
hundred and back, from one hundred... ninety-nine, ninety-eight,
ninety-seven... to one. And again, going up, coming down, going up,
coming down.</p><p>In fact, all this effort keeps them awake. But these are the
suggestions of so- called wise people, who are all around, ready to give
advice like, "Repeat the name of God." That will keep you awake! The
only thing that can bring sleep is to forget all about it -- do
something else, anything will do. Just lying down, what is the harm?
Have a good rest, why be worried about sleep? And when you are at ease,
with no worry, no chanting, no mantra, no God -- you are just
resting</p><p>-- you will find slowly, slowly sleep is coming, enveloping you. You
will not know when you have fallen asleep.</p><p>Do you know exactly at what time you enter from waking into sleep?
You have been sleeping every day for your whole life, but do you
remember, any night, even a single time, the exact moment when you
entered into sleep? Even if you look at your watch, sleep will be gone.
That much effort on your part is enough to disturb it. Sleep comes only
when you have completely forgotten about it.</p><p>And this is a vicious circle: people who are suffering from
sleeplessness cannot forget it for a single moment, and that creates
sleeplessness. And the more they are suffering from sleeplessness, the
more difficult it becomes for sleep to come.</p><p>There are many things in life which need absolute relaxation on your
part. They will come when the right moment is there, and the right
moment means when you have forgotten them completely.</p><p>It happens often that you remember somebody -- seeing him, you know
him, you know his name, it is just on the tip of your tongue. But why is
it not coming out? The more you try...</p><p>It becomes a very weird experience -- you know, you perfectly know,
you are absolutely certain that you know the name, you know the person.
There is not the slightest doubt in you, but somehow it is stuck just on
the tongue -- it does not come out. It becomes a very strange
feeling.</p><p>And then you start doing something else. How long can you go on
sitting with this strange, weird feeling? You just go in the garden,
start digging a hole, planting a tree, or pruning the trees... and
suddenly it is there. When you had forgotten completely to remember it,
it suddenly comes -- surfaces to your consciousness. But it surfaces
only when you have forgotten to remember it.</p><p>These eight months you must have been trying hard to feel me inside
you. In the first place, there was no need. You have to feel yourself;
that is the basic thing that you have not done. You don't know your own
inside -- how can you feel me inside you?</p><p>Just first do the homework: feel yourself, your interiority, your
inner being. And the moment you feel your inner being, you will be so
overwhelmed with joy, relaxation, at ease, that there is a possibility
you may feel me also within you. You may feel stars, you may feel the
sun, you may feel the whole existence within you. But first, feel your
within.</p><p>Let me say it this way: If you can feel your within, the without also
comes within. You become so expansive, your consciousness becomes so
vast, it spreads all over existence.</p><p>It is one of the most beautiful, most blissful experiences.</p><p>And I have no objection if you feel me within yourself -- from my
side, I am absolutely willing to come in. But you don't know that the
doors of your inner subjectivity are closed. First, get settled inside.
Before you invite the guest, please become the host; otherwise, what am
I going to do in an empty house? I am a lazy man. Unless you are there
to take care of me, I am not coming!</p><p>Max Levensky is dragged out of bed at three a.m. one morning and is
hauled before the KGB. He is accused of being anti-Soviet and is then
interrogated.</p><p>"What is the definition of a communist?" demands the KGB man.</p><p>Max replies immediately, "Someone who has read the works of Marx and
Lenin."</p><p>"And what," continues the interrogator, "is the definition of an
anti-communist?"</p><p>Max thinks for a moment and then says, "Someone who has read the
works of Marx and Lenin and understands them."</p><p>You just try to understand yourself, and then everybody will be
coming in -- Marx and Lenin...! But the first thing first. The only
thing that can be said is: the basic need is to know yourself, be
yourself, and everything else will follow. The understanding of yourself
opens the doors of all the mysteries of existence.</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YOU OFTEN TELL US THAT WE SHOULD NOT JUDGE OURSELVES OR OTHER</p><p>PEOPLE.</p><p>I AM A TEACHER AND BECAUSE OF MY JOB I HAVE TO JUDGE THE
STUDENTS.</p><p>NOW THAT I AM GOING BACK TO ITALY, I AM WORRIED ABOUT HOW I SHALL
MANAGE WITH MY JOB. CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME HELP?</p><p>Kalo Shreeman, my saying that you should not judge does not mean that
you cannot say to a student, because you are a teacher, "The answer you
have brought is not right."</p><p>It is not judging the person, it is judging the act. And I am not
telling you not to judge the act -- that is a totally different
thing.</p><p>For example, somebody is a thief -- you can judge that stealing is
not good. But don't judge the person, because the person is a vast
phenomenon and the act is a</p><p>small thing.</p><p>The act is so small a piece... that small piece should not become a
judgment about the whole person. A thief may have many beautiful values:
he may be truthful, he may be sincere, he may be a very loving
person.</p><p>When I say don't judge a person, I am not saying that you are not
allowed to say that somebody is committing a mistake. Somebody is
falling into a well -- I am not saying that you should just stand
silently without judging. This judgment, "Don't go that way" --</p><p>perhaps that man is blind and you have to prevent him; otherwise he
will fall into the well. But preventing him, seeing that he is blind,
does not mean that you are condemning him. The moment you start thinking
in terms of condemnation then judgment enters, and I am against that
kind of judgment.</p><p>One student is doing something which is not right. You are a teacher,
your very function is to put the student on the right path. It is your
love, it is not your condemnation; it is your compassion, not your
judgment. But most often what happens is just the opposite: people start
judging the person rather than the action. Actions have to be corrected
-- and particularly in a profession like teaching, you have to correct;
you cannot allow students to go on doing wrong things. That will be very
cruel, uncompassionate.</p><p>I have been a teacher myself, but I have never judged a single
student as far as his person, his being is concerned. But that does not
mean I have not corrected them if they were wrong. For example, I was
sitting one day with the vice- chancellor. He loved to talk with me
whenever he could get a chance and could find me, because I was very
rarely present.</p><p>And most often I avoided passing by his office because he used to
tell his peon that if he saw me, to just bring me in. He loved to talk;
he enjoyed a good argument.</p><p>I was talking with him, and a girl came crying. So he said to me,
"Just a moment," and he asked the girl, "What is the matter? Why are you
crying?" She said a certain boy, a student in her class had been
harassing her for almost the whole year. "He throws small pebbles at me
in the class, he writes letters to me." And the vice-chancellor said,
"Don't be worried, I will call him and put him right; such things cannot
be allowed. He will be punished, you don't be worried.</p><p>And if he does not stop, I will expel him from the university."</p><p>I was listening, and I said, "Just wait a minute. I want to ask the
girl a few things."</p><p>He said, "Of course, you can ask. If you can help in the matter, it
will be very good."</p><p>I asked the girl, "Are you really hurt by his throwing pebbles at you
and writing love letters to you? Be honest! The day he does not write a
love letter to you, don't you wait for it?"</p><p>The vice-chancellor said, "What are you talking about?"</p><p>I said, "You just keep quiet. When I am talking, you just be a
gentleman -- keep quiet."</p><p>The girl stopped crying. I said, "Do you understand? If no young man
harasses you, will you feel good? Don't you know there are girls who are
not harassed by anybody, and they are suffering?"</p><p>The vice-chancellor said, "What are you saying?"</p><p>I said, "You keep quiet, I am going to solve the matter completely. I
will talk to that boy also."</p><p>He said, "You need not talk, because the way you are talking..."</p><p>I said, "Now I have taken the matter in my hands." I asked the girl,
"Are his love letters not written well? Then I can teach him how to
write love letters! Because every girl wants love letters -- I don't see
that there is anything unnatural in it."</p><p>Now the vice-chancellor was boiling! He said to the girl, "You go
away."</p><p>I said, "She can go only when you answer a few questions in front of
her. When you were a student, just remember those old days -- those
beautiful days. Have you not written love letters to girls?"</p><p>He looked at me, he looked at the girl, and he said, "My God,
what..." For a moment he was silent.</p><p>I said, "Be honest!"</p><p>He said, "Yes I have written..."</p><p>I said, "And just a moment before, you were expelling that boy from
the university and you had forgotten completely."</p><p>Every young man will write letters, and if somebody does not write,
the function of the teacher is to help him: "Are you a dodo or
what?"</p><p>As far as my classroom is concerned, from the very first day I
entered after the long summer vacations, my first thing was... because
in India the girls sit on one side, boys sit on another side, and in
between there is a big space. My first thing was, "Just get mixed."</p><p>They would look very embarrassed.…</p><p>I said, "Just get up, and you can choose whomsoever you want, but get
mixed! I cannot tolerate this stupidity because this is the cause -- you
have to throw stones, you have to write letters... What is the need?
Just sit next to each other, and if you want to say something, whisper.
Whisper -- I can stop; I can give you time. For fifteen minutes you do
whatsoever you want to do. I will keep my eyes closed and meditate, so
that after fifteen minutes we can concentrate on the subject matter.
This is more primary."</p><p>Students were very much afraid of me. With hesitation they would mix
up; still they would sit so that they would not touch each other. I
said, "What nonsense -- do you think each other untouchable? Sit
relaxed. And if you want to nudge the girl, or the girl wants to nudge
you, it is perfectly okay; nature demands it. And because you are
prevented, then you start ugly behavior. Now, taking the air out of the
girls' bicycles -- that I don't think is natural! That is sheer
stupidity. Harassing them on the road, saying ugly dirty words -- I
don't think that is right, nor is it worthy of you.</p><p>"If you want to say something, write a beautiful love letter. If you
don't know how to write, I am here -- I am available. Anybody, male or
female, can come to the common room where I sit. I will teach you how to
write love letters."</p><p>My class was the most silent class, and I told the vice-chancellor,
"Sometime you can come and you can see -- nobody is doing anything to
anybody because</p><p>they are allowed; I accept it as my responsibility that they should
be allowed to be as natural as possible.</p><p>Every girl should feel that she is loved, desired, that there are
people who look at her with loving eyes. Every boy wants to be loved.
And this is the time when they should pass through these
experiences."</p><p>I said to the girl, "What do you want? Tell me exactly. Do you want
the boy to be expelled?"</p><p>She said, "No."</p><p>"Do you want him not to write letters to you?"</p><p>She said, "No." The vice-chancellor said, "Then why have you come
here?"</p><p>I said, "It is very simple -- she simply wants your attention. She
wants to say to the world that she is being loved, somebody is writing
love letters, and without telling others there is no joy in the thing.
The whole world should know that she is no ordinary girl --</p><p>exceptionally beautiful -- people are throwing stones."</p><p>The vice-chancellor said to the girl, "Now you go, because listening
to such things... he can even spoil me. You just leave the room, and if
you don't want to do anything against that boy, never come again." And
when the girl had gone, he said, "You should not do such a thing,
because if people come to know..."</p><p>I said, "In fact, you are afraid of your wife, it is not about
people. And I am going to tell your wife that this old man is
teaching... in front of me, he has been teaching that love letters are
natural."</p><p>He said, "You were saying natural!"</p><p>I said, "You were listening silently! Do you agree with me or
not?"</p><p>He said, "I agree, but don't go to my wife -- that is the only woman
I am afraid of."</p><p>I said, "Then you have to behave."</p><p>Just don't judge so quickly, and don't judge the person. Judge
actions, and correct them, and don't correct them according to
tradition, convention, according to so- called morality, according to
your prejudices. Whenever you are correcting somebody, be very
meditative, be very silent; look at the whole thing from all
perspectives. Perhaps they are doing the right thing, and your
prevention will not be right at all.</p><p>So when I say, "Don't judge," I simply mean that no action gives you
the right to condemn the person. If the action is not right, help the
person -- find out why the action is not right, but there is no question
of judgment. Don't take the person's dignity, don't humiliate him, don't
make him feel guilty -- that's what I mean when I say, "Don't
judge."</p><p>But as far as correcting is concerned: unprejudiced, silently, in
your awareness, if you see that something is wrong and will destroy that
person's intelligence, will take him on the wrong paths in his life,
help him.</p><p>The job of the teacher is not just to teach futile things --
geography, and history, and all kinds of nonsense. His basic function is
to bring the students to a better consciousness, to a higher
consciousness. This should be your love and your compassion, and this
should be the only value on which you judge any action as right or
wrong.</p><p>But never for a single moment let the person feel that he has been
condemned. On the contrary, let him feel that he has been loved -- it is
out of love that you have tried to correct him.</p><p>Conrad was six years old. Although he was six, he had never spoken a
word. His parents took him to the psychiatrist, but it didn't help. But
one evening at the dinner table, Conrad looked down at his plate of food
and said, "Take away this muck, it tastes terrible!"</p><p>His parents were elated and wept with joy. "You can talk!" cried his
mother. "How come you've never spoken before this?"</p><p>"Up to now," said Conrad, "everything has been fine!"</p><p>Don't judge people -- try to understand them. Now he is saying such a
beautiful thing:</p><p>"What is the need to speak when everything is going fine? Only for
the first time something is terrible!"</p><p>A guy lying in a hospital bed, coming around from an anesthetic,
wakes up to find the doctor sitting beside him. "I have got bad news and
good news for you," says the doctor.</p><p>"Would you like the bad or good first?" "Aaagh," groans the guy,
"tell me the bad."</p><p>"Well," says the doctor, "we had to amputate both your legs above the
knee." "Aaagh," groans the guy, "that's really bad."</p><p>After recovering from the shock, he asks the doctor for the good
news.</p><p>"Well," said the doctor, "the man in the next bed would like to buy
your slippers!"</p><p>Just don't be serious! Don't think that you are a teacher so you are
in a very serious job.</p><p>Look at life with more playful eyes... it is really hilarious! There
is nothing to judge --</p><p>everybody is doing his best. If you feel disturbed by somebody, it is
your problem, not his. First correct yourself.</p><p>I have my own way of looking at things.… I was a teacher for nine
years, and I never judged a single student. I have never examined a
single examination paper, because I told the vice-chancellor, "If I
really examine, nobody is going to pass. And if I am going to pass a few
people, why should the others not be passed? So things are clear -- you
can decide -- either I can pass everybody, or I can fail everybody."</p><p>He said, "You always bring strange ideas! I have been a teacher my
whole life; this idea never happened to me."</p><p>I said, "This is exactly what I am going to do, so you can
decide."</p><p>He said, "It is better you don't take any examination papers. I will
inform the in- charge that you should not be given any papers to
examine."</p><p>I said, "That's perfectly right, because that saves me the trouble of
judging people unnecessarily."</p><p>Only once they appointed me as a superintendent of the whole
examination. I said, "You are doing something wrong -- you don't
understand me." That was my first encounter with the new
vice-chancellor. I said, "You don't know me. The old man knew me; he
never committed any mistake like this."</p><p>He said, "What are you saying? Is it a mistake?"</p><p>I said, "It is a mistake because you don't know me. But give it a
try!" So he said, "Okay."</p><p>He came two or three times to see what was happening, and he was
feeling terrible when he heard me telling the students, "Listen, if you
have brought notes hiding in your pockets, I have no objection. Just
don't be caught. Do it cleverly, watchfully, because it is not a sin --
but you should not be caught. To be caught is the crime."</p><p>The vice-chancellor was standing there, listening. And I said to
them, "I will try my best to catch you. So you decide. I give you two
minutes -- if you are afraid of being caught, just bring everything that
you are hiding and put it on the table, and I will not say anything to
you. But after that, if you are caught, then your whole year is
spoiled."</p><p>Immediately, students started bringing their notes -- one boy had
written answers on his shirt, inside. So he said, "What am I supposed to
do? I have no notes but I have written many things on my shirt, inside
-- should I give the shirt?"</p><p>I said, "You have to give it."</p><p>The vice-chancellor was standing there. He said, "What is going
on?"</p><p>I said, "You keep quiet. I told you beforehand, if I am the
superintendent things will be going according to me."</p><p>I told the boy, "You take your shirt off, put it here." He said, "But
it is too cold."</p><p>I said, "That's not my problem -- why have you "</p><p>So he had to take off his shirt. And the vice-chancellor said, "This
is too much."</p><p>I said, "I cannot help.…" And nobody was doing anything -- they had
even brought books, whole books. They were hiding them behind their
coats, shirts, pants, everything came out!</p><p>And I said to them, "Now you can start answering your questions. And
don't be worried, if you cannot answer something, I am here; I am here
to help you. You can just raise your hand and I will come and try to
help you."</p><p>Nobody raised his hand. I said, "What is the matter?" They were
afraid, because this has never happened -- a superintendent telling
them, "I will help you." I said, "This is just human. You are in
difficulty, and I am sitting here doing nothing "</p><p>That was the first and the last time.… The vice-chancellor said, "You
are a strange person.</p><p>That boy is shivering -- how can he write?" It was a cold morning
the</p><p>examinations used to be early in the morning, seven o'clock
Somebody's pants</p><p>had been taken, because people used to write on their pants -- people
do all kinds of things.</p><p>They had their ways, and I knew. I have also been a student, and I
knew all kinds of things. That was very easy, to write on your pants --
nobody will be able to see. But I told them, "It doesn't matter, even if
you have to sit naked sit naked!</p><p>Next time you will not do such a thing. But I am not uncompassionate
to you; if you are in need of some answer that you cannot find, I will
give it to you; you just have to raise your hand. Because according to
me, all examinations are absolutely absurd."</p><p>If it were up to me, I would allow the students to have all the books
available. Only a very intelligent student can find out the answers from
the books in three hours. And you will be able to judge their
intelligence in a better way; otherwise somebody has just crammed five
answers, and he knows nothing else, and he</p><p>comes first in the class. And somebody else knows everything, just
has missed those five questions, and he is a failure.</p><p>This is not a good examination; they should be allowed to have the
whole library available to them. They can go to the library, they can
find the answer, they can write it.</p><p>In three hours, they have to find as beautiful answers as possible.
And only intelligent students will be able to find them.</p><p>In the Soviet Union they have changed this old idea of examinations.
Now books are available -- all the books concerned are available in the
hall where the students are given their examination; they can consult
any book. It is far better, because the ultimate concern is to know the
intelligence of the person, not his memory. So students need not
memorize anything -- they have to understand things. In examination time
they can either just from their intelligence give the answer, or they
can look in the books. But if in a five hundred page book you have to
find one answer, you need some intelligence -- mediocres will not be
able to find the answer, they will become so nervous...</p><p>And there is no need that a person should have to wait for one year.
I told the vice-chancellor, "If I am going to be the superintendent I
will follow my ideas, I don't care what is conventional. The
conventional is not necessarily the right thing. I will give them all
the available material; they can find out. Only the intelligent people
will be able to find out. And those who have not been successful should
be given a chance again after one month. What is the problem that they
should wait for one year?"</p><p>Finally, there is no need of any examinations if every teacher goes
on giving marks in his diary every day to the students. And every year,
all the notes from all the teachers are collected. And based on those
counts the students are moved, either upward or downward. Because there
are many who deserve to go back -- they have somehow slipped, they
should not be allowed... they should be put back; they should earn
better marks and go ahead again.</p><p>And this should remain available: if a teacher finds that an
intelligent student has unnecessarily to wait six months more for
examination, he should recommend that the student be moved right now to
a higher class, because he has enough intelligence. There is no need for
him to wait six months more. Teachers should</p><p>be the decisive factors. In that situation, nobody fails, nobody
passes -- people simply move. A few move faster, a few move a little
slower; everybody according to his pace. Nobody is condemned as a
failure, nobody is praised as first-class, nobody is praised as a gold
medalist. All these things teach people unnecessary ambition, and
ambition is poison.</p><p>You are a teacher; you should try in every way to change the very
structure of teaching, particularly your teaching. And slowly, slowly
things move. You should tell other teachers, "There are many things
wrong with the education system itself, which nobody bothers about. And
you are judging students; the first thing should be a right system of
education." The whole system is rotten, old, out of date; it has to be
completely changed.</p><p>So I am not saying don't judge. Particularly systems, conventions,
traditions -- judge them! But don't judge individuals. If their actions
are wrong, help them to get free of those wrong actions. If they are
going in wrong directions, help them to find right paths.</p><p>And this should be your love, this should not be your judgment.</p><p>"Young man," said the judge, looking sternly at the defendant, "it is
alcohol, and alcohol alone, that is responsible for your present sorry
state."</p><p>"I am glad to hear you say that," replied Paddy, with a sigh of
relief. "Everybody else says it is all my fault!"</p><p>Okay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.</p><p>The Invitation Chapter #26</p><p>Chapter title: You have your problem -- I'm going home 3 September

TREMBLES WITHIN ME. I FEEL A GIVING OF EVERYTHING TO THIS</p><p>WONDERFUL GIFT OF LIFE. SOMETHING IS HAPPENING THROUGH ME OR</p><p>WITH ME OR IN SPITE OF ME -- AND I KNOW THIS IS HOME. BELOVED MASTER,
BELOVED MYSTERY, WHO AM I?</p><p>The mystery of life always happens in spite of you. In the beginning
there is no other alternative possible. Only in the end does it start
happening through you. But it can happen through you only when you are
not. Then you become a hollow bamboo which can be turned into a flute
and the song can pass through it.</p><p>In the beginning you are -- you are too much.</p><p>So when the first experience of mystery starts happening it is in
spite of you. And it is good to understand that life is far bigger than
you can conceive and its power is immense beyond our any conception;
just we are waiting patiently, searching patiently, knowing perfectly
well that we don't know the way, knowing perfectly well that we have
lost our original eternal home -- knowing perfectly well that we are
unconscious. All our efforts, our search, our seeking is groping in the
dark.</p><p>It is good to remember our situation. Do your best. In spite of your
darkness, blindness, unconsciousness, whatever you can do, do. But
remember, it is not going to happen through your doing. It is going to
happen because you are longing for it so deeply that existence cannot
resist, cannot remain indifferent to you.</p><p>So although you are not prepared, nobody is prepared. Nobody knows
the way, nobody knows where the home is, nobody knows in which direction
to move, what discipline to follow.</p><p>But there are two kinds of people: those who are not aware of their
situation of darkness and blindness, and those who think that they are
not blind, that they are not in darkness; that they know the way, that
they know where they have to go, that they know what they have to
do.</p><p>These are the people to whom existence cannot happen; they are too
much. And all that they know is absolutely false, they have not
experienced it. But their falsity is so much identified with their
being, it is their ego which says, "You are not blind. There is no
darkness and all that is needed you know it through the scriptures,
through the old masters, through reading, learning, studying." But all
that is borrowed; it is not going to help.</p><p>No two persons reach the end on the same route. Hence Gautam Buddha
may have reached through a certain path and Chuang Tzu may have reached
through another path, but their paths are no longer useful for you. In
fact, it is impossible to find their paths either. Their paths disappear
just as the birds flying in the sky don't leave any footmarks.</p><p>So you cannot find out from where the world has reached to the
heights, and you cannot follow because there are no footprints. All
there is, is what is written in</p><p>your scriptures...</p><p>and you try. The Buddhist tries the way Buddha may have followed. In
the first place there is no way to find what way he has followed,
because the way is inner and nobody is capable of giving an expression
to it. So what is written is a faraway echo in the minds of the
disciples.</p><p>It is a strange story to remember that the man who remembered the
most of what Buddha has said in forty-two years... And Buddha
continuously resisted their efforts to write it down because he did not
want to leave any scripture behind nor did he want to leave any statue
of himself. He wanted to disappear just as if he has not come. One of
his names is Tathagata. It has two meanings; both are significant. One
is: the man who taught the philosophy of suchness. The other is more
literal but has a tremendous significance.</p><p>Literally the word `tathagata' means just came, just gone, leaving no
mark behind, just like a breeze comes you feel it and the coolness of
it, and it is gone. Neither do you know from where it comes nor you know
where it goes.</p><p>So for his whole life Buddha did not allow his statements to be
compiled. And in the end he said to them, "No statue, no memorial should
be made of me because I want to disappear as if I had never been.
Because whatsoever is left behind becomes the hindrance for people; it
does not help them."</p><p>There is a great insight, very profound -- and such egolessness, such
simplicity, such humbleness that he wants to disappear silently without
any footprints, because nobody can follow anybody else. Nobody can
become wise by reading and studying scriptures.</p><p>So that greater part of humanity which believes that they know, they
are the ones to whom the mystery is not going to happen. But if you are
searching, knowing perfectly well that you know nothing -- you don't
even know that your ignorance is absolute; it is not that a little bit
you know and a little bit you don't know -- in this humbleness, in this
acceptance that I don't know, the mysteries start happening. They happen
in spite of you.</p><p>You cannot manage -- they are not manageable, they are not under your
control -</p><p>- but once they start happening they make their way through you.</p><p>Slowly, slowly the ice of your ego melts and a passage is made.
Existence starts</p><p>singing its songs, sending its music, giving you directions; helping
you to find the doors of all that is mysterious and is not available to
the mind but only to the man of heart, to the man of humbleness -- to
the man who is perfectly aware that he knows nothing.</p><p>And it is good that you ask, "Beloved Master, beloved mystery, who am
I?"</p><p>You are Swami Satyadharma. This much you should remember; otherwise
in the ordinary life you will get lost. Once you forget that you are
Swami Satyadharma then you don't know where you are going and what you
are doing.</p><p>I have told you two small stories...</p><p>One is about George Bernard Shaw. He is traveling in a train from
London to some place and the ticket checker comes. Bernard Shaw looks
into everything, opens this suitcase, that suitcase, all the pockets,
and the ticket is missing. He starts perspiring and looks very much
afraid and concerned.</p><p>The ticket checker says, "I know you; everybody knows you. The ticket
must be somewhere; there is no problem. You will find it. Don't get so
nervous and excited in your old age" -- he was ninety.</p><p>The ticket checker said, "I will not disturb you, I am going. You
just relax."</p><p>George Bernard Shaw said, "You don't understand. It is not the
question of the ticket.</p><p>Who is bothering about the ticket? The question is where am I going?
Can you tell me where I am going? Without the ticket... now I have got
into a tangle. I am not searching for the ticket for you -- I don't care
about you or anybody. But the problem is: Where am I going?"</p><p>The ticket checker said, "My God, that is impossible for me to figure
out where you are going. Now I can understand why you are feeling so
nervous. Your hands are trembling."</p><p>The second anecdote is about Mulla Nasruddin in the same situation as
George Bernard Shaw. The ticket checker is asking for the ticket and he
is looking everywhere. Other passengers are puzzled that he looks into
every pocket but he leaves one pocket. He does not touch that one.</p><p>Finally, the ticket checker said, "You have looked everywhere but you
don't look into this pocket."</p><p>He said, "Don't talk about that pocket. That's my only hope and I
don't want to destroy that hope. If it is not there I'm finished. Then
it is nowhere else. So I cannot open that way. I will look everywhere
possible..."</p><p>He had thrown all the clothes and everything out of the suitcases.
The ticket checker was at a loss, the passengers were at a loss. But
Mulla was absolutely reluctant, "Whatever happens, I am not going to
touch that pocket. That I will leave because at least there is a hope
that perhaps the ticket is there. If the ticket is not there then I am
completely finished."</p><p>The problem is the same: I don't know where I am going. So as far as
the world is concerned, you are Swami Satyadharma -- and there are two
Swami Satyadharmas here.</p><p>Remember, you are not the other one. To make it clear, the other one
is German; so don't get mixed.</p><p>Just as you call me Beloved Master, beloved mystery, I call you
beloved disciple, beloved mystery. Behind Swami Satyadharma everything
is a mystery. Satyadharma is just a facade for the outside world, just a
utilitarian identity; it is not your reality; but behind it is a
mysterious being. You are becoming aware of gifts of existence, of
mysteries. Something is happening through it; just allow it.</p><p>Your function is not to prevent, not to be reluctant. Join your hands
with whatever is happening. That's what I mean by let-go.</p><p>Let existence cleanse you. Allow it total power over you.</p><p>Don't be worried that you will be destroyed, because you will be
destroyed. There is no need to worry; it is absolutely certain. When
things are certain there is no worry. It is only the uncertainty that
creates worries.</p><p>You will be destroyed.… That which will remain undestroyed in you is
your authentic self. That which is destroyed is your personality, your
false self; it needs to be destroyed.</p><p>You can use that destroyed part in the world because they won't
understand if you say that you are a mystery. Even your family, your
wife, your children, your parents will think you have gone mad if you
say, "I am a mystery." Nobody is a mystery and only you are a mystery?
-- where did you lose yourself?</p><p>So as far as the outside world is concerned you are Swami Satyadharma
-- not the other one; that you have to remember! This is a problem for
sannyasins because they have the same names, many. You can get lost and
start thinking, Who am I? And naturally, you are a mystery, but a German
mystery or an Italian mystery... this much you should remember: that you
are not a German mystery.</p><p>For the outside world, completely keep your old false identity, your
name, your profession, your qualifications. But inside you will know
that it is only utilitarian, not real, useful; useful in the society,
but when you are alone you are not Swami Satyadharma and you are not
Italian or German or English.</p><p>You are not even your body. You are not your mind.</p><p>You are just the pure mystery behind.</p><p>Now there is no way to describe it, you will have to experience it,
and you are moving rightly towards that experience. Just don't in any
way knowingly out of fear hinder the process. There is no fear: only the
false will die and the real will remain always and always. That is the
definition of the real: That which remains.</p><p>The false is just useful. In the crowd of the world you need a name.
The reality is nobody has a name, but it will be a very difficult world
if everybody drops the name because it is false. Then you won't have any
address. The postman cannot find you anywhere because everybody is a
mystery! You will create troubles because you are not the husband and
you are not the wife and you are not the father and you are not the
child -- everything outside will be disturbed, will become a chaos.</p><p>Outside keep everything as it is. Inside don't be identified with
it.</p><p>This is the whole secret of finding yourself without being condemned
by the</p><p>society as mad.</p><p>A traveling salesman was just on the point of checking into a hotel
when he caught sight of a stunning young woman who was without doubt
giving him the full come-on treatment. He strolled over to her and
nonchalantly exchanged a few words with her, behaving as though he had
known her all his life. Then they both walked to the reception desk and
booked in as man and wife. After a one- night stay, the salesman went to
collect his bill and check out. He was appalled to be presented with a
bill for one thousand pounds.</p><p>"Look here, this is out of the question. I have only been here for
one day," he cried.</p><p>"Yes sir," replied the receptionist, "but your wife has been here a
month."</p><p>So don't get into such trouble. On the outside remain exactly what
you are, Swami Satyadharma.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YOU ADVISE WATCHING PATIENTLY THE UNTANGLING OF THE GORDIAN</p><p>KNOT THAT TIES ME TO THE PAST. SOME PART OF ME IS HAPPY TO DO</p><p>THAT; ANOTHER PART WANTS YOU TO SLASH THE KNOT ASUNDER. IS</p><p>THIS LAZINESS OR MASOCHISM OR A MIND TRIP?</p><p>It is not masochism, Prem Rajiva, nor is it a mind trip. You are
sincerely wanting to get out of the entanglement. You want to be free of
all entanglement; you want to come out of the prison. What you are
calling the Gordian knot, you want it to be slashed.</p><p>It is a sincere and authentic desire, but the trouble arises because
this desire is also from the mind. So one part of the mind is ready to
cut the Gordian knot and</p><p>another part of the mind is always against. It is not a special
question about the Gordian knot that divides you.</p><p>Mind's functioning is through duality. The right word used for that
is `dialectics'. Karl Marx has used that word as a foundation of
communism. He calls his philosophy dialectical materialism. He says the
society evolves through dialectics, and by dialectics he means it will
be helpful to you for your development -- and what he says has some
truth in it.</p><p>The meaning of dialectics is that one part functions as the thesis,
another part functions as the antithesis and out of the conflict of the
two comes the third part, a synthesis.</p><p>Synthesis on its own accord becomes again thesis and creates
antithesis, and their conflict brings a new synthesis. This is how step
by step evolution happens.</p><p>And he is right, although he used his philosophy to support a
political ideology. That is fictitious, but the idea of dialectics in
itself is absolutely correct.</p><p>He says that the proletariat, the poor are the thesis, and the rich,
the capitalists are the antithesis. Now there is going to be a class
struggle, a revolution, a fight between thesis and antithesis that will
create the dictatorship of the proletariat as the synthesis. On its own
then it will become the thesis and it will create its antithesis as
democracy of the proletariat. And out of the conflict between the two
will arise another synthesis.</p><p>Every man's capacity to think is limited. That synthesis never
becomes thesis. He has come to the end of his row; he has arrived at a
state where there is no class, no government. He has achieved the
utopia. Now there is no need of any conflict, any revolution. But I
don't see that evolution is going to stop anywhere. So he has used a
very significant principle of philosophy for his political ideology. And
as he reaches to his ultimate goal he forgets all about dialectics. That
is not only his fault -- everybody's. The religions say God created the
world, and when you ask them who created God -- finished.</p><p>They have come to the end of their row.</p><p>The Jainas in India say that man has been evolving, not in his
physiology as Darwin thinks -- that in physiology he is evolving from
apes or monkeys or gorillas -- but Jainism says man is evolving through
different animal</p><p>consciousnesses, not physiologically but in his soul. It seems more
accurate than Charles Darwin. Charles Darwin does not have any
evidence.</p><p>The whole thing seems to be hypothetical because nobody has seen any
monkey, because if in the past, thousands of years ago, some monkey
became a human being, why are other monkeys not becoming human beings
now? They are now more evolved as man has evolved. Now they will be
jumping every day! Suddenly you see a monkey, and he jumps and becomes a
man and says, "Hello, where are you going? I am coming too."</p><p>Nobody has encountered any monkey becoming a man. And the difference
between a monkey and man is so great that it cannot be possible to take
a jump suddenly. Monkeys know how to jump, but that does not mean they
can jump and become a human being.</p><p>They can jump from one branch to another branch -- that's perfectly
okay -- but they cannot jump from one state of consciousness into a
totally new state of consciousness, because it needs a new brain, a
different size of brain; it needs a different structure of the body.
Just to stand on two legs a monkey will need so much bodywork that he
will not survive.</p><p>It has happened in Lucknow...</p><p>A boy was found who had been raised by wolves in the forest, and just
the other day a girl was found. She was the same age, thirteen, and she
had been raised by animals. So the boy and girl walk on all fours --
naturally, they have imitated their parents.</p><p>It has happened in Calcutta too. They tried to make him stand on two
legs, thinking that the man should be restored to humanity -- they
killed him. Just the effort to make him stand on two legs was so
difficult because he now had a fixed structure. For fourteen years he
had walked on all fours; now suddenly he could not stand.</p><p>And the same happened in the Lucknow case: in six months they had
killed the boy. I put the whole responsibility on the stupid idea that
these people should be restored. They were perfectly beautiful; there
was no need. This boy who was killed in Lucknow by the scientists and
the doctors... They were giving him all kinds of medicines and
injections and bodywork and massage. And the boy was so strong that they
needed four or five people to catch hold of him; otherwise he</p><p>used to run faster on his four feet than any runner. He could have
come first in any Olympic race anywhere; he was a wolf.</p><p>It would have been more humane to leave him back in the forest. But
this is how the unconscious mind functions. Now a girl has been found in
Europe and they have immediately started working on her to restore her.
They will kill her. I can predict it --</p><p>because this "restoration" is not possible; it would take a
lifetime.</p><p>As for the Lucknow boy, in six months the whole success for the
scientists and the doctors was that he learned one word: the name Ram
that they had given to him. That was their whole success -- and they
enjoyed very much, that they had done "great service." All they did...
There are five billion human beings, what is the point of taking a
beautiful wolf back into humanity, and rejoicing that he has learned the
name Ram?</p><p>And thousands of people were coming -- he had become an exhibition --
to ask him,</p><p>"What is your name?" And he would say, "Ram" -- with anger. According
to his mind, it was purely torture because traction was being done.</p><p>Suddenly a monkey cannot become... And Charles Darwin also was
looking for a middle link. The monkey must have become first a middle
link between man and monkey, and then from middle link he may have moved
to monkey. He never could find any middle link; his hypothesis remains
hypothesis.</p><p>All these philosophers go on using some idea. Once they get attached
to it they extend it into a philosophy, into a whole system. That's what
Marx did. But dialectics is a natural phenomenon, particularly as far as
man's psychology is concerned: mind functions through dialectical
ways.</p><p>You will never find mind without any split.</p><p>I keep coming across very intelligent people.… I wanted one of our
sannyasins who is a very intelligent legal expert, to come here -- and
there is no problem in coming. His wife is also as educated as he is.
They were both colleagues in law college, his wife was a magistrate. He
has been in the commune. The wife had also come, but because they had a
small child she went back and took a job as a</p><p>magistrate. Now that her husband has gone back to join her, she has
dropped out of her job. So I told both of them they could come here. He
informed me that ninety percent he wants to come, but ten percent of his
mind thinks of security, safety; the child, his education, old age, the
future...</p><p>I have come across such people all my life, and I have asked them
only one thing: If you are intelligent enough, then why are you choosing
the ten percent part of your mind against the ninety percent? You are
not realizing at all that you are choosing ten percent of the mind --
and you are afraid to choose the ninety percent.</p><p>And mind is never going to be a hundred percent for anything. That is
not the way mind functions, it is out of the question. Mind's function
is always to be divided on every question: a thesis, antithesis, and
then you have to find out the synthesis, and you have to function
according to the synthesis.</p><p>So there is no problem about your being a masochist; you are not on a
mind trip either. It is simply the way of the mind that it never
functions as a total unit. In fact, if you see the dialectics in life
you will find it in many places. You walk, that is dialectical. If both
your legs move together one hundred percent you will fall down. Fifty
percent remains static, fifty percent moves. Then the other fifty
percent becomes static and the static part starts moving. That's how you
walk; that is dialectical philosophy. That's how a bird flies; that's
how you use your hands.</p><p>Even your mind is not one single piece; it has two hemispheres. Your
right hand is connected with the left side of your mind and your left
hand is connected with the right side of your mind. So if something goes
wrong with the left side of the mind, for example paralysis, then your
right hand will be paralyzed.</p><p>Both have different functions. The right side of the mind thinks and
the left side of the mind feels, and thinking and feeling are just like
two legs. They cannot join together; otherwise there will be no progress
in life. You will remain static.</p><p>So it is simply a matter of not understanding the nature of mind. You
have one part of the mind ready -- let it go and do its job. That is the
moving leg, and the other part is the static part. And you think that
you would like me to slash the knot asunder. I cannot do that because I
love you.</p><p>Once I started doing things for you, you would become dependent on
me. And</p><p>that is the last thing that I will tolerate. I would not like you to
be dependent on me. I can give you the way, I can show you the way, but
I will not walk for you. You will have to walk yourself, because I want
you to be absolutely independent and free. Today I am here, tomorrow I
may not be here.</p><p>If you become dependent on me, as has been happening all over the
world for centuries --</p><p>people become dependent on the masters, and the masters enjoy the
dependence. Neither are the masters authentic nor are the disciples
intelligent -- and humanity has remained static.</p><p>Are you aware of the fact that for centuries there has been no
evolution? If monkeys have become human beings at some time, what have
human beings done? -- they are stuck. At least some daring human being
should take a jump and start flying, do something! But you know
perfectly well that if you try flying, there will be no evolution, only
multiple fracture.</p><p>It has happened to a few people under LSD or under impact of some
drug -- particularly LSD gives these ideas that you can fly. And one
woman flew out from an eighty-storey building, from the eightieth floor.
She simply flew out of the window. And you know what would happen... so
it happened.</p><p>LSD is a very harmless drug, but it should be used under medical
supervision, because it gives such ideas, great ideas, and the mind is
no longer functioning so there is no opposition; there is a</p><p>one hundred percent surety -- and that is very dangerous. A one
hundred percent surety is not favorable to evolution. It is good that
the mind should be divided for and against, discuss, argue, and slowly
slowly progress.</p><p>But one thing is strange, that for at least one million years there
has been no evolution as far as man is concerned. You cannot call this
evolution: one person becomes a Gautam Buddha or one person becomes a
Bodhidharma or one becomes a Tah Hui -- you cannot call that evolution.
The whole of humanity is stuck somewhere.</p><p>What is the problem? The problem is, humanity is not moving with the
part of the mind which is for evolution; it is staying with the part of
the mind which is not for evolution.</p><p>You have to learn only one thing, that you have already a part of
your mind ready, happy to do that. So do it! Don't bother about the
other part of the mind. That mind is pulling you back; it represents
your past. And the mind that is feeling happy and excited to do
something, it represents your future. Choose the future.</p><p>Don't depend on somebody else, because that dependence is dangerous.
It is not only one question that can be solved, there are a thousand and
one questions -- and your evolution depends on your own readiness to
risk, your own acceptance of danger.</p><p>You are in a right position; there is no problem. Just listen always
to the part of the mind that is for the future, that is for the unknown,
that is for evolution, and the other part will come following
behind.</p><p>Once you are decisive, the other part of the mind will immediately
follow you. It will remain against you until you are decisive. And the
decision has to come from looking at the fact of which mind is for the
future and evolution, which mind is going to give you a better life, a
better understanding, a better consciousness -- choose that and the
Gordian knot will be slashed without any effort on your part or without
any need from outside help.</p><p>A woman leaned over her side of the fence and asked the little boy
next door how he was getting on with his new stepfather.</p><p>"Great," he replied, "every morning he takes me out in the boat to
the ocean, puts me in the water and then I swim back to the beach."</p><p>"But is not that a bit dangerous for a little boy?" asked the
woman.</p><p>"Oh, that's easy. The hard part is untying the knot and getting out
of the bag."</p><p>It is certainly a little harder... but if you can manage to do it, it
will give you a sudden quantum leap for a higher consciousness.</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YOU OFTEN TALKED ABOUT PSYCHOANALYSIS AND RELATED</p><p>THERAPIES.</p><p>WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT ON MORE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS LIKE</p><p>FRITZ PERLS' GESTALT THERAPY AND -- THE LATEST FASHION -- VOICE</p><p>DIALOGUE? CAN THESE THERAPIES HELP A PERSON WHO IS ALREADY</p><p>MEDITATING TO SEE HIMSELF AND HIS GAMES MORE CLEARLY?</p><p>Tilo, in the first place psychotherapies like Fritz Perls' Gestalt
therapy and others are already old; they are not new. The only new thing
which is the latest fashion is Voice Dialogue -- but they are all just
mind games.</p><p>They cannot contribute anything to a man who is already meditating --
no psychotherapy has the quality of meditation, because no psychotherapy
has produced a single enlightened being. Their founders were not
enlightened and the enlightened beings in the East never bothered about
any psychotherapy. They have not even bothered about psychology or mind
itself, because for them the question was not to solve the problems of
the mind, for them the question was how to get out of the mind which is
easier. Then the problems all are finished, because once you are out of
the mind, the mind has no nourishment to go on creating problems;
otherwise it is an unending process.</p><p>You get psychoanalyzed, whether old or new fashions it doesn't
matter; they are just variations of the same theme. Your mind feels a
little fresh and good after a psychological session, because you have
unburdened yourself. A little understanding of mind also comes -- that
keeps you normal.</p><p>In fact, all psychotherapies are in the service of the establishment;
their function is not to let people go abnormal. Somebody is going
outside the herd and the norms of the herd and doing things which it is
not supposed that you should do...! They may be harmless but the society
cannot tolerate such people. They have to be brought to the normal, to
the average standard.</p><p>The psychotherapist's work is to clean your mind. It is a kind of
lubricating your mechanism -- it functions a little better and you start
becoming a little more</p><p>understanding about the functionings of the mind, although that does
not make any revolutionary change. And it is possible you may solve one
problem, but you have not removed the cause.</p><p>Mind itself is the problem.</p><p>So you can remove one problem, mind will create another problem... It
is just like pruning the trees: you prune one leaf and just out of
self-respect and dignity the tree will grow three leaves in the place
where there used to be one. That's why gardeners go on pruning; that
gives trees more foliage, more leaves.</p><p>The same is the situation with the mind: you can remove one problem
by understanding it</p><p>-- and it is costly -- but the mind is still there which has created
the problem, and psychoanalysis does not go beyond the boundaries of the
mind. The mind will create a new problem, more complicated than the one
that you have solved. Naturally, because the mind understands you can
solve that kind of problem, it creates something new, more complicated,
more foliage.</p><p>Meditation is a totally different thing than psychoanalysis or any
therapies which are confined to the mind. It is simply a jumping out of
the mind: You have your problems --</p><p>I'm going home.</p><p>Because mind is a parasite it does not have its own existence. It
needs you inside in it, so it can go on eating you, your head. Once you
jump out of it, the mind is just a graveyard.</p><p>All those problems that were too big drop, they simply drop dead.</p><p>Meditation is a totally different dimension: you simply watch the
mind and in watching you come out of it. And slowly, mind with all its
problems disappears; otherwise the mind is going to create strange
problems.</p><p>The other day in England a court released a murderer. It is a very
strange case, and it may give impetus to many people to murder. The
murderer was in the second world war fighting in Japan. And he pleaded
in the court that in the night he dreamt that the Japanese were chasing
him, and they were just about to get</p><p>hold of him. He became so frightened and he wanted to survive, so he
caught hold of the neck of one Japanese and killed him by pressing on
his neck. And as the Japanese was killed, he awoke from the dream and
the Japanese was no one but his wife.</p><p>The court was in a difficulty what to do, because he had not done it
consciously, in awareness. Now to punish him does not seem right, even
in a traditional England, where anything new takes years to be accepted.
When the whole world will accept it then England will try!</p><p>The judge must have been a man of great understanding, but he has
also opened a door of dangers. Now anybody can kill his wife and say,
"What can I do? Japanese were following..." It is a precedent that you
have released one man, acquitted completely from committing any
crime.</p><p>Now you are able to commit crime. You just have to pretend that you
are asleep, and there is no way for the court to find out whether you
were really asleep and the Japanese were really following you in your
dream. The poor woman was fast asleep, he jumped up and killed her --
and perhaps he is right... But now there will be cases which will not be
right. Perhaps what he is saying is true; he has been in the war in
Japan and that may have come as a dream from his unconscious; and out of
fear, to protect himself, he started fighting with the Japanese. And
there was nobody else in the room except the wife close to him just on
the bed, so he jumped, caught hold of the Japanese...</p><p>Mind is your only problem.</p><p>All other problems are just offshoots of the mind. Meditation cuts
the mind from the very roots.</p><p>And all these therapies -- Gestalt and Voice Dialogue and Fritz Perls
-- we can use them for those who have not yet entered into meditation
just to have a little understanding of the mind so they can find the
door from where to get out.</p><p>We are using all kinds of therapies which are helpful, but not for
the meditators. They are only helpful in the beginning when you have not
yet become accustomed to meditation.</p><p>Once you are meditative you don't need any therapy, no therapy is
helpful then.</p><p>But in the beginning, it can be helpful, and particularly for the
Western sannyasins.</p><p>I don't suggest it much for Eastern people that they should do
therapy groups. For example, Japanese have been found not to understand
that in an encounter group if people are fighting it is just playful
fighting. They really start fighting and they can become dangerous; they
can kill somebody.</p><p>Different cultures... Japanese have been writing letters to me saying
that in the therapies they are telling us that you hate your mother,
your father -- and it is absolutely wrong!</p><p>We will kill the therapist! Japan has a totally different culture.
The very idea that you hate your mother -- and the person will commit
hara-kiri. He will kill himself because it is so shameful.</p><p>I have come to know such stories of hara-kiri that you cannot
believe. One famous historical case happened three hundred years ago. A
very well-known master of martial arts forgot, when he went to meet the
emperor, to bow down. In Japan you have to bow down even to your enemy
when you go to fight.</p><p>Both bow down to each other because one never knows who will be left
alive. At this moment enmity and friendship don't matter. At this moment
when one person is never going to be seen again and will not even be
able to ask for forgiveness, they give respect.</p><p>And it is authentic, it is not formal.</p><p>Going to the emperor and forgetting to bow down... And he forgot
because he was a great master and thousands of people who were learning
under him were all bowing down to him. So he had become accustomed to
people bowing down to him, and then he would respond by the same
gesture. It was such bad manners that when he was made aware that he had
committed a great crime because he had not bowed down to the emperor, he
committed suicide.</p><p>That is the routine process. There is no other way except that to
show that you really feel repentant. It is not so easy as in the West
where you can just say, "I'm sorry" -- that is very formal and very
easy. Japanese take things very seriously. The only way you can say,
"I'm sorry" is by hara-kiri -- one feels so ashamed of himself that he
cannot allow himself to live anymore.</p><p>The more strange thing is that his three hundred intimate disciples
committed hara-kiri because their master had behaved in a shameful way.
They were not at all concerned, but because their master has fallen in
grace, how can they stand in the world with grace and dignity? Three
hundred disciples committed hara-kiri. This is a historical fact, and
this kind of thing has been happening in Japan for centuries.</p><p>So one sannyasin has written to me, "The therapist goes on insisting,
`You must hate your mother...' Either I will kill the therapist or I
will kill myself if he is right. Because I don't see that I have ever
hated my mother."</p><p>And in fact the situation is different. In Japan almost one-third of
the girls don't marry; they remain with their mother. In the rest of the
world the situation is different. And what psychoanalysis has found does
not apply to the Japanese. It applies only to the Western mind and its
upbringing.</p><p>Sigmund Freud is right only about the Western mind and its tradition.
When he says that every girl hates her mother because she loves the
father, the whole thing is based on their understanding of sex, that one
loves the opposite sex. So girls love the fathers, the boys love the
mother. But the girls cannot express their love, particularly they
cannot be sexually related with the father, and the mother is related
sexually. So they become jealous of the mother -- the mother is their
enemy. The boys become enemies of the father and because of that the boy
cannot make love to the mother.</p><p>The Japanese cannot even think of this; even Indians cannot think of
this -- just a totally different upbringing. Indians cannot believe what
kind of nonsense this is. And for the Japanese things are very
difficult. If you insist and you convince him that he hates his mother
or he hates his father -- and the whole psychoanalysis depends on these
kinds of things: who you hate, why you hate... And they go on digging
deeper and they prove to the person that from very childhood there has
been a jealousy and that is creating all the problems.</p><p>"Why can't you love your wife?" -- the psychoanalyst will come to the
conclusion that you wanted to love your mother -- and your wife is not
your mother -- and the wife does not love you because she wanted to love
her father and you are not her father. So you are bound to fight
continuously. You have fallen in love with the girl because something in
her resembles your mother. And the girl has fallen in love for the same
reason: something in you resembles her</p><p>father.</p><p>So you have married your mother; she has married her father. This is
psychoanalysis.</p><p>And because neither she is behaving like your mother nor you are
behaving like her father, problems arise.</p><p>But to say to a Japanese, "You have married your mother," is simply
out of the question.</p><p>To say to an Indian, "You have been secretly loving your mother and
you wanted a sexual relationship with her..."; he cannot even
think..."Are you in your senses or..."</p><p>In India the tradition is that the son loves his mother almost like a
goddess. He loves his father and respects his father next to God. And
the difficult thing is that even the people in the East who are teaching
or who are in the profession of psychoanalysis, as professors or as
practitioners, they have all learned from the West and they don't
understand that the East has a totally different orientation.</p><p>And Sigmund Freud or Jung or Adler or Assagioli or Fritz Perls have
no idea. Not even in their dreams have they thought that people can be
different from the Western people.</p><p>In the East psychoanalysis is not of much help. For the Westerners, I
like them to go through groups just to clean the mind. With a clean
mind, to enter into meditation is easier. But if you don't enter
meditation and you simply depend on cleaning the mind, then you will be
cleaning the mind for your whole life and you will not go anywhere
else.</p><p>Because of its different orientation the East should find seats in
the universities for meditation, not for psychoanalysis.</p><p>One of the great Indian psychologists who was the head of the
department in the Hindu university of Varanasi belonged to a village
near my village; and moreover, he was father-in-law to one of my friends
who had studied with me. He was one of the most respected professors of
psychology, but he was condemned by everybody because people, thinking
that he would be able to help them with their mind problems, would go
for psychoanalysis, and</p><p>psychoanalysis brings... They would ask, "Whom do you hate?"</p><p>And the Indian would find himself at a loss because everything comes
down to sex -- and the Indian cannot accept that idea. It is not the
same orientation as in the West.</p><p>This man's name was Laljiram Shukla. And because his son-in-law was
my friend, the son-in-law was continuously telling him that he must meet
me at least once. He was an old man. I was just out of the university.
He invited me to come to Varanasi because his son-in-law was continually
praising me. It became a psychological problem for the psychologist that
the son-in-law was more interested in me, and not interested in him and
was continually praising me. It became a challenge to him.</p><p>I was not aware what the situation was. When he invited me I thought
perhaps it was because of my friend; he may have talked about me, so I
went. I was a guest in his house, and I immediately became aware of a
certain tension.</p><p>I asked my friend, "What is the matter?"</p><p>He said, "The problem is that I have been talking about you not
knowing that he was feeling very offended. But he never showed it, and
now, because you are here -- and many other professors have become
interested; all his students, nearabout twenty postgraduates, they are
all coming in the morning to meet you</p><p>-- he is feeling very much wounded."</p><p>So in the morning he exploded. He started arguing with me, and
because I told him, "All your education is from the West; all that you
are talking is simply nonsense in the East --</p><p>what do you know about meditation? All your knowledge is about the
mind, and that too of a certain mind, the Western mind. You are
betraying the East by teaching people all kinds of nonsense, which does
not make any actual impact on them, because that is not their
problem.</p><p>"I have never seen anybody, I have looked in so many people's
minds... In the East nobody is jealous of the father, nobody wants to
make love to the mother, but without these things the psychoanalyst will
say, Ìf you want to be cured you will have to cooperate.'"</p><p>And I argued with him -- I had to because he was so angry with me
that I could not understand why he had invited me. And because he could
not answer, I asked him directly, "I ask you, have you ever in your
childhood wanted to make love to your mother? Have you ever thought in
your childhood to kill your father because he was your competitor for
the same sex object, the mother?"</p><p>He cooled down, and he said, "Never. I never thought about these
things."</p><p>I said, "What are you doing now? Imposing on people ideas which are
not their problems, are you helping them or destroying their integrity?
You are telling them that their problems are things which are not their
problems."</p><p>In the East for centuries the problem has been how to get beyond the
mind -- the only problem, the single problem. But for the Western mind,
because it has developed in a different way, it has never thought about
transcending mind. I have looked into Jewish sources, into Christian
sources; there is not a single statement in the whole history of the
West where somebody has made an effort to go beyond the mind.</p><p>They have used the mind to pray, they have used the mind to believe
in God; they have used the mind to become religious, virtuous, but they
have never even thought that there is a possibility of going beyond the
mind.</p><p>In the East that has been the only, single search. The whole genius
of the East has been working for one thing, no other problems: how to go
beyond the mind. Because if you can solve your problems wholesale just
by going beyond, then why go for retail solving of problems. The mind
will go on creating; it is a very creative force. You solve one problem,
another problem arises. You solve that problem, another problem
arises.</p><p>It is a good business for the psychoanalyst, because he knows you are
never going to be cured. You are not going to be cured of the mind; he
cures your specific problems. Your mind is there, the source. He never
cuts the roots, he only cuts leaves, branches at the most, but they go
on growing again -- the roots are there.</p><p>Meditation is cutting the very roots of problems.</p><p>I repeat: the mind is the only problem, and unless you go beyond the
mind, you will never go beyond problems.</p><p>It is strange that even today, the Western psychologists have not
even pondered over the fact that the East has created so many
enlightened people. None of them has bothered about the analysis of the
mind.</p><p>Just as in the Western literature -- religious, philosophical,
theological -- there is no idea of going beyond the mind, in the same
way in the Eastern philosophical literature there is nowhere any mention
that psychoanalysis or psychology is of any importance. The West has
lived with the mind and the East has lived beyond the mind, so their
problems don't seem to be the same.</p><p>Ugly things can happen when you impose. For example, Erhard was
running the movement of EST -- and it looks stupid to the Eastern
meditator. What he was trying to do is so hilarious, but people felt
very good. You will also feel very good if you do it, without paying him
the two hundred and fifty dollars fee for you to become enlightened.</p><p>And how you become enlightened is a very simply process.</p><p>You are not allowed to go to the bathroom, so your bladder goes on
becoming more and more filled with... and it starts hurting -- and you
are not allowed to go to the bathroom.</p><p>And the session continues from the morning till night. The whole day
to contain yourself, to resist the temptation...!</p><p>In such a situation who is listening to what nonsense he is talking?
You are trying to hold yourself so that in some unaware moment... And
then it starts happening, because how long can you do it? Particularly
women don't have any control on the bladder; man has a little control,
but women don't have.</p><p>So one woman starts pissing -- and when one starts... And Erhard used
to say, "That is great!" And she feels certainly immensely relieved.
First you created the tension and the tension became too much; it became
anguish, agony. And now, she feels so released: It is enlightenment."
She says, "I have got it" -- and then follows a chain... Somebody else
starts getting it, somebody else starts getting it</p><p>-- they used to fill the whole hall with urine. And they have paid
two hundred and fifty dollars -- you can do it on your own!</p><p>If this is enlightenment, just close your room, and if you need some
help it can be very easy; your friend can tie you so you cannot go to
the bathroom. Then,</p><p>contain yourself as long as you can and there comes a moment when you
cannot contain. Then the bladder simply takes over. You are simply
surprised by what is happening. And such a great relaxation and relief
follows, such peace that you have never known -- peace that passes
understanding!</p><p>These idiots have been creating new fashions in psychology, in
psychoanalysis, therapies</p><p>-- and earning millions of dollars, and cheating people. It is not
enlightenment. And if this is enlightenment then there is no need to be
enlightened. It is perfectly good to go to the toilet... forget all
about enlightenment.</p><p>The East has never bothered about the mind, has not even taken any
note of it, has ignored it. From Patanjali to Gautam Buddha, to
Shankara, to Ramakrishna, to J.</p><p>Krishnamurti -- the whole tradition does not bother about the mind.
The mind is mentioned only for one purpose: how to transcend it.</p><p>Hundreds of methods have been found which can help you to transcend
the mind, and once you are beyond the mind all its problems look as if
they are somebody else's problems. You attain to a state of a watcher on
the hills, and all the problems are in the valleys. And they don't have
any impact on you; you have gone beyond them.</p><p>The West has remained utterly mind centered. In the West the only
thing they have thought about is matter and mind. And matter is the
reality and mind is only a by-product; beyond mind there is nothing.</p><p>In the East matter is illusory, mind is a by-product of all your
illusions, projections, dreams. Your reality is beyond matter and mind,
both.</p><p>So we divide reality in the East into three parts: matter, the
outermost; the soul, the innermost; the mind is in between the two.
Matter has a relative reality; it is not absolutely real, just
relatively real. The mind is absolutely unreal, and the soul is
absolutely real.</p><p>This is a totally different categorization of humanity. In the West
the categories are simple: matter is real, mind is just a by-product,
and there is nothing beyond mind.</p><p>So remember, Tilo, if you are meditating then nothing else is needed.
If you are not meditating, then these psychotherapies may be helpful as
a stepping-stone for meditation.</p><p>It was sunrise, and the young athlete was doing push-ups on the beach
when a drunk appeared.</p><p>The drunk weaved his way to within a few yards of the perspiring
young man, sat down on the sand and laughed and laughed.</p><p>"What the devil are you laughing about?" asked the annoyed young man.
The drunk laughed and said, "Don't look now, but somebody stole your
girl." Unnecessarily doing push-ups...</p><p>The West is unnecessarily making tremendous effort in analyzing the
mind -- utterly useless unless they accept a transcendental state. And
that's why again and again they get cheated by frauds. For example,
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is cheating the whole of the West by any stupid
thing. First it was transcendental meditation, then people became fed up
with it because it was not meditation; it was mind repeating a mantra.
You were not going beyond the mind, so what is transcendental in it?</p><p>So his earnings became very low; he had to invent something new. So
he has invented spiritual yogic flying. First he started by spiritual
levitation: you can meditate and become so light that you will start
rising upwards! -- and you can find idiots everywhere... And people were
paying four hundred dollars for learning spiritual levitation. In the
first place what are you going to do by... even if you levitate, what
purpose is going to be served by it? In the second place nobody was
levitating; people were hopping.</p><p>Trick photography was being used and spread. People were shown to
have levitated, and they had levitated with their mattress also -- that
was strange. The mattress also has become yogic, spiritual...!</p><p>He was continually asked, "Give a public demonstration of your
levitation" -- and he could not. A case was brought in the Supreme Court
of America by seven of his own disciples, who had been working hard on
levitation and found that it was absolute nonsense -- they were just
hopping! So they had brought a case</p><p>against him, demanding ninety million dollars. He has been cheating
the whole world, and he has accumulated tremendous money.</p><p>Maharishi Mahesh Yogi dropped that idea because he could not give a
public demonstration. He came with a new idea, and this new idea is
yogic flying -- even greater. And what is the purpose of yogic flying?
-- if one person can learn to fly, then ninety-nine persons in the world
will become meditative and silent and peaceful.</p><p>A big business, because it means for five billion people to become
peaceful -- no war, no conflict, just blissfulness -- millions of people
will have to learn yogic flying. Again, he was aware that he would be
asked to give a public demonstration. He has given one demonstration in
Europe, and now another is planned in America soon. And what people saw
was, it was the same hopping, but now it is hopping not only in one
place, you go on hopping...</p><p>Every frog knows it! And it is so stupid that people are paying
millions of dollars to learn what the frogs know without any difficulty.
They are giving public demonstrations and they don't even see that they
are being absolutely stupid. A few have become so expert that now there
are hurdle races; small hurdles are places and they hop over the
hurdles.</p><p>They are great spiritual people.</p><p>But I don't see the connection. Even if they can hop, and go on
crossing the hurdles, in what way is this going to create peace in the
world...? Nor can it create peace in the person who is hopping. It will
create more retardedness in him. The very idea that he has accepted this
stupid thing shows that he has no intelligence at all. And what peace,
how can peace be attained by these kinds of things?</p><p>He is now proposing to the world that if millions -- he has
calculated exactly how many millions of people are needed to learn
hopping to prevent the third world war.</p><p>I don't believe that man is so stupid that he gets caught by such
frauds. People are learning. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi has opened an academy
in Switzerland where thousands of people are learning hopping.</p><p>The West is being exploited by all kinds of frauds for the simple
reason that the</p><p>West has not looked into the matter of meditation itself. So any
idiot goes and says anything, and gathers followers because they don't
know what meditation is. Neither will chanting a mantra nor hopping nor
levitation...</p><p>These things have nothing to do with meditation. Meditation has only
one meaning, and that is going beyond the mind and becoming a witness.
In your witnessing is the miracle -</p><p>- the whole mystery of life. Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Osho. The Invitation Chapter #27</p><p>Chapter title: Still time to change the trains</p><p>4 September 1987 am in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium Archive</p><p>code: 8709040</p><p>ShortTitle: INVITA27</p><p>Audio: Yes Video: Yes Length:</p><p>107</p><p>mins Question 1</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I AM ALSO GETTING OLD. WOULD YOU TELL ME A FEW LAWS FOR MIDDLE</p><p>AGE ALSO?</p><p>Amrito, everybody is getting old. Since the day you were born, you
have been getting old</p><p>-- each moment, each day. Childhood is a flux, so is youth -- just
old age never ends, because it terminates! That is the unique quality of
old age, that it brings you to ultimate rest. But you want a few laws
for middle age... You are a man of medicine, you should know better.</p><p>As far as I am concerned, I have never been a child, never a youth,
and never become old and never will die. I know only one thing in me
that is absolutely unchanging and eternal.</p><p>But just for your sake...</p><p>There are many laws about middle age, because all over the world
people become old.</p><p>And many thinkers have been thinking, What is this old age? The first
law is De Never's Lost Law; obviously about old age, the law can be the
last: Never speculate on that which can be known for certain.</p><p>You know perfectly well you are getting old, now don't speculate on
that, that will make you more miserable.</p><p>The law is beautiful, never speculate on that which can be known for
certain. In fact, in life, except death nothing is certain; everything
can be speculated upon,</p><p>but not death.</p><p>And old age is just the door to death.</p><p>Middle age is when you begin to exchange your emotions for
symptoms.</p><p>Lendel's Law: You know you are getting old when a girl calls "No,"
and all you feel is relief.</p><p>Old age is when you start to turn out the lights for economical
rather than romantic reasons!</p><p>Old age is that period of life when your idea of getting ahead is
staying even. Old age is when you can do just as much as ever, but would
rather not.</p><p>Old age is a mysterious experience, but all these laws have been
found by the Western mind. I have not been able to discover anybody in
the whole literature of the East talking about old age. On the contrary,
old age has been praised immensely, because in the East it has been
thought that you are not old. If your life has simply moved on the
horizontal line, you are only aged. But if your life, your
consciousness, has moved vertically, upwards, then you have attained the
beauty, the glory of old age. Old age in the East has been synonymous
with wisdom.</p><p>These are the two paths: one is horizontal, from childhood to youth,
to old age and to death; another is vertical, from childhood to youth,
to old age, and to immortality. The difference in quality of both the
dimensions is immense, incalculable. The man who simply becomes young,
and old, and dead, has remained identified with his body. He has not
known anything about his being, because being is never born and never
dies; it is always, it has been always, it will be always, it is the
whole of eternity.</p><p>On the vertical line the child becomes young, but the youth on the
vertical line will be different from the youth on the horizontal line.
Childhood is innocent, but that is the point from where these two
different dimensions open up. The youth on the horizontal line is
nothing but sensuality, sexuality and all kinds of other stupidities.
The youth on the vertical line is a search for truth, is a search for
life</p><p>-- it is a longing to know oneself.</p><p>A man on the vertical line cannot be called young if he is not
meditative, and the same is true about old age. On the horizontal line,
old age is simply trembling, afraid of death; I cannot think of anything
except a graveyard, and darkness which goes on becoming darker and
darker. It cannot conceive of himself except as a skeleton.</p><p>On the vertical line, old age is a celebration; it is as beautiful as
man has ever been.</p><p>Youth is a little foolish -- is bound to be; it is inexperienced, but
old age has passed through all the experiences -- good and bad, right
and wrong -- and has come to a state where it is no longer affected by
anything concerned with body or mind.</p><p>It is a welcome! old age on the vertical line is keeping its door
open for the ultimate guest to come in. It is not an end, it is a
beginning of a real life, of an authentic being.</p><p>Hence, I continuously make the distinction between growing old and
growing up. Very few people have been fortunate to grow up; the
remainder of humanity has only been growing old. And naturally they are
all moving towards death. Only on the vertical line does death not
exist; that is the way to immortality, to divinity. And naturally, when
one becomes old on that dimension, he has a grace and a beauty and a
compassion and love.</p><p>It has been noted again and again... There is a statement in Buddhist
scriptures that as Buddha became older, he became more beautiful. This I
call a true miracle. Not walking on water -- any drunkard can try that.
Not turning water into wine -- any criminal can do that. This is a true
miracle: Buddha became more beautiful than he was in his youth; he
became more innocent than he was in his childhood -- this is growth.</p><p>Unless you are moving on the vertical line, you are missing the whole
opportunity of life.</p><p>But here our whole effort is to block the horizontal line and open
the blocked vertical line. Then every day you are coming closer to life,
not farther away. Then your birth is not the beginning of death, your
birth is the beginning of eternal life. Just two different lines and so
much difference.</p><p>The West has never thought about it; the vertical line has never been
mentioned because they haven't been brought up in a spiritual atmosphere
where the real riches are inside you. Even if they think of God, they
think of him outside. Gautam Buddha could deny God -- I deny God. There
is absolutely no God for the simple reason that we want you to turn
inwards. If God is -- or anything similar -- it has to be found inside
you; it has to be found in your own eternity, in your own ecstasy.</p><p>To think of oneself as a body-mind structure is the most dangerous
idea that has happened to people. That destroys their whole grace, whole
beauty, and they are constantly trembling and afraid of death, and
trying to keep old age as far away as possible. In the West, if you say
to an old woman, "You look so young," and she knows she is no longer
young, she will stand in front of the mirror for hours to check whether
any youthfulness has remained anywhere. But she will not deny it, she
will be immensely happy. In the East, nobody says to an old woman, "You
are young"; on the contrary, old age is so respected, loved, so that to
say to somebody, "You look younger than your age,"</p><p>is a kind of insult. .</p><p>I am reminded of one incident that happened life...</p><p>I was staying in Chanda -- a far corner of Maharashtra -- with a very
rich family, and they were very much interested in an astrologer. They
loved me and I used to go at least three times per year. That was their
quota, and I used to stay there for at least three or four days each
time. Once when I went there, without asking they had arranged with the
astrologer to come and to look at my hands and tell some things about
me. When I came to know about it, everything was fixed; the astrologer
was sitting in the sitting room. So I said,</p><p>"Okay, let us enjoy that too!"</p><p>I showed him my hand; he pondered over it and he said, "You must be
at least eighty years old."</p><p>Of course, one of the daughters of the rich man freaked out, "This is
stupid. What kind of astrology..."</p><p>At that time I was not more than thirty-five -- even a blind man
could have measured thirty-five and eighty! She was really angry, and
she told me, "I am</p><p>finished with this astrologer. What else can he know?"</p><p>I said, "You don't understand. You are more Westernized -- educated
in the Western style. You have been to the West for your education --
you can't understand what he was saying."</p><p>She said, "What was he saying? It was so clear there is no need to
understand; he was simply showing his stupidity. A thirty-five-year-old
young man, and he is saying that you are eighty years old."</p><p>I said, "Be patient."</p><p>And I told her a story about Emerson...</p><p>A man asked Emerson, "How old are you?"</p><p>Emerson said, "Nearabout three hundred and sixty years."</p><p>The man could not believe... and he had always believed in Emerson
that he is a man of truth! What had happened -- a slip of the tongue? Or
had he become senile? Or is he joking?</p><p>To make things clear he said, "I did not hear what you said. Just
tell me how much...?"</p><p>Emerson said, "You have heard it -- three hundred and sixty
years."</p><p>The man said, "I cannot believe it. You don't look more than sixty
years."</p><p>Emerson said, "You are right in a way: on the vertical I am three
hundred and sixty, and on the horizontal I am sixty."</p><p>Perhaps he was the first Western man to use this Eastern expression
of horizontal and vertical.</p><p>Emerson was immensely interested in the East, and he had a few
glimpses which bring him closer to the seers of the UPANISHADS. He said,
"Actually I have lived sixty years; you are right. But in sixty years I
have lived as much as you will not be able to live even in three hundred
and sixty years. I have lived six times more."</p><p>The vertical line does not count years, it counts your experiences.
And on the vertical line is the whole treasure of existence -- not only
immortality, not only a feeling of divineness, but the first experience
of love without hate, the first experience of compassion, the first
experience of meditation -- the first experience of the tremendous
explosion of enlightenment.</p><p>It is not a coincidence that in the West, the word ènlightenment'
does not have the same meaning as in the East. They say that after the
black ages, dark ages, came the age of enlightenment. They refer to
people like Bertrand Russell, Jean- Paul Sartre, Jaspers as very
enlightened geniuses. They don't understand that they are misusing a
word, dragging it into the mud. Neither is Bertrand Russell enlightened
nor Jean-Paul Sartre nor Jaspers.</p><p>Enlightenment does not happen on the horizontal. Even in his old age
Jean-Paul Sartre was still running after young girls. Bertrand Russell
changed his wife so many times, and he lived long on the horizontal --
almost a century. But even in his old age, his interests were as stupid
as young people.</p><p>The East understands that the word ènlightenment' has nothing to do
with genius, has nothing to do with intelligence, it has something to do
with discovering your real, authentic being. It is discovering God
within you.</p><p>Amrito, you need not be worried about laws. Those laws are all on the
horizontal line. On the vertical line there is love, no law; there is
the growing experience of becoming more and more spiritual and less and
less physical, more and more meditative and less and less mind, more and
more divine and less and less of this trivial material world in which we
are so much enmeshed.</p><p>On the vertical line, slowly you feel desires disappearing,
sensuality disappearing, sexuality disappearing, ambitions disappearing,
will to power disappearing... your slavery in all its aspects
disappearing -- religious, political, national. You become more of an
individual. And with your individuality growing clear and luminous, the
whole humanity is becoming one in your eyes -- you cannot
discriminate.</p><p>There are great experiences on the vertical line; on the horizontal
line there is only decline. On the horizontal line the old man lives in
the past. He thinks of those beautiful days, those Arabian nights when
he was young; he thinks also of those beautiful days when there was no
responsibility and he was a child running</p><p>after butterflies. In fact, for his whole life he has been running
after butterflies -- even in old age.</p><p>Mulla Nasruddin was passing along a street...</p><p>And he saw a beautiful young woman so he gave her a good nudge. The
woman was shocked, because Mulla was old; all his hairs were pure silver
white. The woman said,</p><p>"You should be ashamed -- all your hairs are pure white. You are the
age of my grandfather -- you should have been dead by now. You are
showing your ugliness.…</p><p>Mulla said, "Listen, my hairs are white, that's true, but my heart is
still black -- dark black."</p><p>On the horizontal line, that's what happens -- your hairs will become
white, but you don't become white. In fact, on the contrary: as you grow
old, you become more and more infatuated by desires, because now you
know that ahead there is only death. So you enjoy as much as possible,
although enjoying becomes difficult, physically you have lost the
energy. So the old man on the horizontal line becomes cerebrally sexual;
he is continuously thinking of sex.</p><p>Psychologists have been watching thousands of people, and they have
concluded that every man thinks of a woman at least once in three
minutes. Just check it! That will show you on what line you are --
horizontal or vertical. And each woman thinks of a man one time in seven
minutes. That is the difference that creates conflict. The moment the
husband comes and asks, "Dear, what about it?" and she says, "I have a
headache, don't torture me any more..." The difference is that she
thinks of it only one time in seven minutes, that means one day in seven
days...!</p><p>The man thinks of the woman one time in three minutes, that is
average. In old age those three minutes shrink into one minute. The old
man has nothing else to do but to think --</p><p>and what else is there to think about? He imagines beautiful
women.</p><p>One day Mulla Nasruddin was sitting on his balcony watching the
beautiful sunset...</p><p>And suddenly he shouted to his servant, "Bring my glasses, bring my
glasses quickly!"</p><p>The servant said, "What calamity has happened?" He brought his
glasses.</p><p>Mulla said, "You idiot, when I say quick it mean quick. We missed the
opportunity."</p><p>The servant said, "I don't understand, what opportunity?"</p><p>He said, "Such a beautiful woman was going by, but my eyes can't
figure out whether she is a woman or a man, whether she is really
beautiful or I am imagining. Glasses were needed, but by the time you
brought the glasses she was gone."</p><p>The servant said, "You are under the wrong impression; she was not a
woman! He is my brother who has come to see me. Nobody else has
passed."</p><p>The old man is continuously thinking of the past -- this is the
psychology. The child thinks of the future because he has no past; there
is no question of thinking of the past --</p><p>no yesterday. He thinks of days to come, the whole long life. Seventy
years gives him space... He wants to become big enough quickly to do
things that all the big people are doing.</p><p>The old man has no future -- the future means death; he does not even
want to talk about the future. The future makes him tremble. The future
means the grave</p><p>-- he talks about the past.</p><p>And the same is true about countries. For example, a country like
India never thinks of the future. That would mean it had become old; it
is symptomatic. It always thinks of the past. It goes on playing the
life of Rama and Sita; for centuries the same story... every village
performs that drama. It goes on thinking about Buddha and Mahavira and
Adinatha and RIGVEDA and the UPANISHADS.</p><p>Everything has passed. Now the country is simply waiting to die;
there is no future.</p><p>According to the Indian idea -- and that is the idea of the old
mentality, the mind of the old man -- the best age was millions of years
ago; it was called satyuga, the age of truth.</p><p>After that man started falling.</p><p>You can see the psychological parallel; there are four ages:
childhood, the young man, middle age, the old man. According to these
four he has projected four ages for life itself.</p><p>The first age was innocent, just like a child -- very balanced. They
give the example that it has four legs just like a table, perfectly
balanced. And then the decline starts.…</p><p>In India, the idea of evolution has never existed, but on the
contrary just the opposite idea. The word is not even used in the West
-- you may not have even heard of the word -</p><p>- but in India they have been thinking about involution, not
evolution: "We are shrinking, we are falling down."</p><p>In the second stage of the fall one leg is lost; the table becomes a
tripod. It is still balanced, but not as much as it was with four legs.
In the third stage it loses another leg; now it is standing only on two
legs, absolutely unbalanced. And this is the fourth stage: even two legs
are not available; you are standing on one leg -- how long you can
stand?</p><p>The first stage is called satyuga, the age of truth; the second is
simply named by the number; treta is the third, because only three legs
are left. The second is called dwapar.</p><p>Dwa is exactly what two is in English; this `two' comes from the
Sanskrit dwa; moving through many other languages it becomes twa, and
then finally it becomes two. And the fourth age they have called
kaliyuga, the age of darkness.</p><p>We are living in the age of darkness. This is the mind of the old
man: ahead there is only darkness and nothing else. The child thinks of
the future, of the golden future; the old man thinks of the golden past.
But this happens only on the horizontal line. On the vertical line, the
past is golden, the present is golden, the future is golden; it is a
life of tremendous celebration.</p><p>So rather than being worried about the laws of old age, think about
which line your train is moving on. There is still time to change
trains; there is always time to change trains because from every moment
that bifurcation is available. You can shift, shift from the horizontal
to the vertical; only that is important.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING AGAIN ABOUT COMING TO THE MASTER AND</p><p>GOING BACK TO THE WORLD?</p><p>Again?</p><p>Chetan Dhyan, it seems you have heard it before. Where were you that
time? And are you certain you will be able to hear this time?</p><p>I can say... in fact I am saying everything again and again and
again, but you are not ever at home so you don't know. You think I am
saying new things every day</p><p>-- from where can I get new things? I have stopped reading; for
twelve years I have not touched a single book. I don't meet people, so I
can't gather gossips or gospels. I don't go anywhere. I just talk to you
and go to sleep!</p><p>In sleep do you think I can find new things every day? My sleep is
dreamless, contentless</p><p>-- just a pure silence. It is another name for meditation to me.</p><p>Nirvano just takes care that once in a while I sleep, or else the
body suffers; otherwise the whole night I am awake. I have divided the
day into two parts because there is nothing to read. I have read so
much, and now I am utterly bored when I come to look at books. I already
know what these idiots will be writing. And there is no other
source.…</p><p>The only thing is that you feel what I am saying is new, that you
have never heard it before. You have been here, but I will not refuse
your question. I will repeat it again! But before I say anything about
it, to wake you up I will tell you a story. I use stories and jokes to
keep you awake! If I start talking about pure</p><p>philosophy there will be complete silence and people will start
snoring!</p><p>For centuries people have been snoring whenever religion,
spirituality, philosophy and meditation were discussed. And all the
great masters have been in immense agony because of their compassion --
what to do with these people? But I have found a way: there is no need
to say to you, "Wake up!" I simply tell you a joke when I see you are
slipping into sleep. Then you just straighten up, open your eyes, look
all around -- I don't allow anybody to snore!</p><p>A man from Warsaw in Chelm on a business trip, was walking down the
street when he was stopped by Yossel the chimney sweep. "Zalman!" cried
Yossel. "What has become of you? It's so long since I have seen you.
Just look at yourself."</p><p>"But wait," replied the stranger, "I'm..."</p><p>"Never mind that," said Yossel. "I can't get over how much you have
changed. You used to be such a big man, built like an ox. And now you
are smaller than I am. Have you been sick?"</p><p>"But wait," replied the stranger, "I'm..."</p><p>"Never mind that," said Yossel. "And what has become of your hair?
You used to have a fine head of black hair, and now you are completely
bald. What has happened? You know, I don't see how I ever recognized
you. Zalman, what has become of you?"</p><p>"I have been trying to tell you," the man replied. "I am not Zalman."
"Oy," replied Yossel, "You have gone and changed your name as well!" If
one does not want to listen, what to do! You will find some way out.</p><p>Your question is beautiful. You say, "Can you say something again
about coming to the master and going back to the world?"</p><p>The moment you have found a master, wherever you are the master will
be with you.</p><p>Finding the master means drinking from his well.</p><p>Finding the master means becoming yourself -- so attuned with the
master, so in accord, in such a deep harmony, that you only appear two,
but you have become one. The bodies are two, but the inner flames of
your life have become one. Once you have found the master, there is no
way to go anywhere where you can be without the master.</p><p>If going to the world you find yourself alone, without the master,
that simply means only one thing, without any doubt -- you have not
found the master yet.</p><p>There is a beautiful story about Mahakashyapa, one of the most
significant disciples of Gautam Buddha -- perhaps just second to him, or
maybe just equal to him. He never asked any question, he never bothered
Buddha about any problem. Finally, Buddha became concerned, "What is the
matter? Everybody is asking, everybody is receiving the answer, and this
Mahakashyapa never asks anything. And if he does not ask there is no
point in answering him -- what am I going to answer?"</p><p>He called Mahakashyapa. With tears, Mahakashyapa came to him and he
said, "The only thing is that I am afraid of enlightenment."</p><p>Buddha said, "You are strange. You have left your kingdom and you
have become a sannyasin, and now you are afraid of enlightenment?"</p><p>He said, "That's true, that's why I don't ask anything, because I am
afraid if I become enlightened you will send me away to spread the
message, the word. I have been watching; those people who have become
enlightened have been sent away, and I cannot live a single moment
without... Just leave me alone. I don't want any enlightenment, I just
want to be with you. And I can be with you only if I am unenlightened;
once I am enlightened I know you will send me."</p><p>Buddha said, "I promise you, I will not send you. But just out of
that fear, don't prevent yourself from becoming enlightened -- you don't
know what it is!"</p><p>Because of the promise of Gautam Buddha, Mahakashyapa became
enlightened on the second day. All this time he had been becoming
silent, peaceful -- no question, no answer; the chattering of the mind
had gone away. For twenty years he had been sitting in deep closeness
with Buddha, and his love for him was so much that he was ready to drop
the idea of enlightenment.</p><p>You will find very few disciples who will be ready to drop the idea
of</p><p>enlightenment.</p><p>They will say, "This is stupid. For enlightenment we have come to a
master, and then for the master we drop the idea of enlightenment! It
does not make sense."</p><p>But once Buddha promised him, the next day he became enlightened. And
Buddha called him, "Mahakashyapa, now you have to go and spread the
word."</p><p>Mahakashyapa said, "And what about your promise?"</p><p>Buddha said, "A promise was given to an unenlightened man! You are no
longer the same man; that man has gone. To you I have never given any
promise."</p><p>Mahakashyapa said, "That's true. That man is gone, but be kind
enough... Forget about the promise because you are tricky, you are
getting out of it. Let me be here."</p><p>But Buddha said, "What will you do here? Don't you know that once you
have become enlightened, wherever you are I am with you? I am you. What
is the difference between my enlightenment and your enlightenment? Just
a day ago you were an unlit candle; today you have your own flame -- and
the flame is the same. Today you are a buddha yourself."</p><p>Mahakashyapa touched his feet and said, "I will go, but just allow me
one thing, that wherever I am I can bow down towards your direction and
touch your feet. Your feet will not be there, but I can touch the ground
and kiss the ground. This much you will have to allow me."</p><p>Buddha said, "I can allow you. There is no harm in it, but what will
others think? They will think you are crazy. First you are going to talk
about meditation, enlightenment --</p><p>they will think you are a little strange -- and when they see you
kissing the earth and touching the earth with your head then it will
become certain to them that you are really mad."</p><p>Mahakashyapa said, "That you can leave to me. That is my problem; you
should not interfere in it. First you tricked me into enlightenment --
for twenty years I was so happy.</p><p>Now I am more happy and more blissful. For twenty years I was happy
in spite of my ignorance, now I am happy, simply happy -- there is no
ignorance, there is no darkness. I am grateful to you. I know you are
within me now, but whatever the world thinks I will continue to touch
your feet -- at least from far away, just in your direction."</p><p>And his whole life he continued. People were amazed seeing him every
morning, every evening, "What are you doing?" But he was such a luminous
figure, nobody could think that he was mad. In fact, they had never seen
such a man of genius, intelligence, awareness, love, compassion,
blissfulness -- twenty-four hours in ecstasy. So they could not think
that he was mad, but what was he doing?"</p><p>He said, "I bow down to my master's feet. He must be a thousand miles
away, just in the direction... I cannot forget my gratitude towards him.
If he had not tricked me I would have remained unenlightened
forever.</p><p>"Just for me to become enlightened, my master was even ready to lie.
He promised me --</p><p>knowing perfectly well that he was not going to keep his promise --
and he is a man of his word; I have never seen him going against his
word. But his compassion was so much, and his love was so much, how can
I forget him?</p><p>"It does not matter where he is I bow down in gratitude morning and
evening, and that is my most precious time. I am blissful, I am
ecstatic, I am enlightened."</p><p>But I want you to know that he said to people again and again, "Even
my great ecstasy is less than the ecstasy I feel when I bow down to my
master. Whatever I am is his compassion and nothing else."</p><p>Chetan Dhyan, you need not be worried if you have found the master in
me. Then wherever you are you will find me very close, nearby -- just
following you like a shadow.</p><p>But if you get lost into the world, that will also be a good
experience, to understand that you have not found the master. In any
case, these are the only two alternatives -- either you will find me in
your gratitude, in your love, in your peace, in your silence, in your
meditations, in your joy, or you will forget about me in the crowd. In
both of the ways it will be a beautiful experience and a</p><p>beautiful test.</p><p>I want everybody here... those who are essential to run the commune
should remain here; otherwise, people should come and go. They can
manage it to be here for three months --</p><p>be here three months and go back into the world.</p><p>The day you can start finding me wherever you are is the greatest day
of your life.</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>LOVING TO HEAR YOU LAUGH, LOVING YOUR JOKES, LOVING YOU</p><p>--</p><p>BELOVED MASTER, WOULD YOU SPEAK TO US ABOUT LAUGHTER?</p><p>Anand Svabhavo, when you are hungry you don't want somebody to speak
on food!</p><p>When you are in a river drowning, you don't want somebody else to
talk about the art of swimming. There are right moments and right
situations, and there are things which can be talked about, yet
misunderstood.</p><p>Laughter is a mystery. It is better to experience it than to hear
someone talk about it. But one becomes curious, "What is laughter?"</p><p>Laughter is the most intelligent factor in you.</p><p>Buffaloes don't laugh, and if you meet a buffalo laughing you will go
mad! Then it will be impossible to bring you to sanity. No animal
laughs. Laughter needs a very sensitive intelligence. It means that you
can understand the ridiculousness of a certain situation.</p><p>What are jokes? They are a very clever arrangement. They take you in
a direction logically, rationally, you start expecting that now this is
going to happen, this is going to happen... and it goes on happening
according to your</p><p>expectations. Then comes a sudden turn and something happens which
you could never have imagined. That brings laughter to you.</p><p>It is a very internal process of your rational expectation. If what
you were expecting happens, there will be no laugh. But if you see
something that you could not have conceived and everything went well up
to the end -- and then suddenly something happens that makes you
immediately forget all your reason, logic, mind...</p><p>Laughter is the only ordinary experience when you are no longer a
mind, and I use it to give you glimpses of no-mind, of meditation, of a
transcendence of mind. Perhaps I am the first man in the whole history
of mankind who has been using jokes as a preparation for meditation.
Jesus would not laugh; Buddha will not laugh; Lao Tzu is not heard to
have ever laughed... They were serious people, and they were doing
serious work!</p><p>It will be good to understand a small incident which began the
tradition of Zen. Those are the people who understand -- the only people
on the earth, a small stream who have understood the meaning of laughter
because their origin is in laughter.</p><p>It was again Mahakashyapa...</p><p>He was sitting under his tree -- he was sitting under his tree for
twenty years. It had almost become his tree; nobody else used to sit
under that tree. Everybody knew that that was the place for Mahakashyapa
and not to disturb that man. "He never asks, he never says anything, he
never talks -- why disturb him? Just leave him alone." It had become an
accepted fact. But one day he laughed -- and that day was his day of
enlightenment.</p><p>A great king, Prasenjita, asked his wife... His wife was a disciple
of Gautam Buddha, a lay disciple, not a sannyasin, but immensely
interested in Gautam Buddha and hoping that one day her husband would
allow her to become a sannyasin. Prasenjita was not interested in
sannyas; he was interested in increasing his kingdom, to make it bigger
and bigger. He was always fighting, invading new areas.</p><p>By chance, Buddha had come into the capital of Prasenjita, and the
wife was insisting,</p><p>"You have to come with me to welcome him because it doesn't show
culture, refinement if you don't come. A man of the caliber of Gautam
Buddha happens in millions of years.</p><p>Kings and queens are a rupee a dozen! You can find them anywhere;
they are not worth much. You will be forgotten, but Gautam Buddha's name
will remain till the last man has become enlightened. You may be
remembered if you go to Gautam Buddha and touch his feet. Just this
small act on your part will make you historical".</p><p>And that is true -- who would have heard about Prasanjita? There were
hundreds of other kings at that time, and we don't know anything about
them, but Prasanjita is known. And because the wife was insistent, he
said, "Okay, but I have to present something to him."</p><p>He had a very beautiful diamond. Other kings were jealous of that
diamond; perhaps that was the best diamond available in those days. So
prasenjita said, "What else can I offer to him? I will offer this
diamond."</p><p>The wife said, "You don't understand, a diamond or a stone is equal
to him. It will be better that you take a lotus flower, because to him
the lotus flower represents a revolution</p><p>-- it comes out of dirty mud. And it is the most beautiful flower on
the earth, most fragrant, the biggest flower. It comes from the dirt, it
crosses the water and stands on top of the water. This is a great
revolution: dirt turning into such a beautiful...</p><p>"So velvety are the flowers, leaves and petals that when dewdrops in
the night gather on the big petals and big leaves, they are so velvety
that the water cannot touch them. They remain on the lotus leaves, but
the lotus leaf remains untouched by them. The lotus flower remains in
the water but the water does not touch it -- that gives it another
significance that a man should live in the world untouched by it. He
should live in the world but not allow the world to enter him; he should
live in the dirty world, but he has the possibility of becoming a lotus
flower."</p><p>So the lotus became a symbol for the transcendence from the trivial
matters of the world.</p><p>Gautam Buddha is represented in thousands of temples sitting on a
lotus flower. That lotus flower represents his philosophy -- it has
become a symbol. So she said, "In our beautiful pond at the palace I
will find the best and biggest lotus flower -- you take the lotus
flower."</p><p>The husband did not think that a lotus flower had any value in
comparison to his diamond which could purchase a whole kingdom. So he
said, "Okay, I will take both, and I will see which he prefers. This is
my first meeting, so let me judge the man."</p><p>He touched the feet of Buddha and wanted to give the great diamond.
Ten thousand disciples were present. They could not believe the radiance
of the diamond, its clarity, purity, its perfection -- and it was so
great. There was complete silence, because everybody was watching what
Buddha was going to do now, because it was against his disciplines to
have anything more than three changes of clothes and one begging bowl
--</p><p>that had to be the only possession for any sannyasin. Now what was he
going to do...?</p><p>Was he going to refuse the king? -- that will be insulting. Was he
going to accept it? --</p><p>but that will be against his discipline. So there was great silence
and great curiosity.</p><p>Buddha saw the diamond and told prasenjita, "Drop it!"</p><p>Very reluctantly, he dropped it, because now there was no way... He
has presented, and the man is saying "Drop it." Under the impact of
Buddha and those ten thousand people -</p><p>- in which there were nearly two dozen enlightened people -- he
dropped the diamond.</p><p>Then he brought from the other hand the lotus flower, thinking that
perhaps his wife was right.</p><p>Buddha said, "Drop it!"</p><p>prasenjita could not believe what kind of man he was, "I have brought
presents and he goes on saying, `Drop it.'"</p><p>The third time, when he had dropped the lotus flower, his hands were
empty, but Buddha said loudly, "Drop it!"</p><p>He said, "I don't have anything to drop."</p><p>That was the moment when Mahakashyapa for the first time in twenty
years started laughing, madly. prasenjita was very much offended, but
Gautam Buddha called Mahakashyapa gave him the lotus flower, and told
him, "From you will start a totally new and unique, fresh stream."</p><p>That fresh stream has developed into Zen -- but it was born in the
laughter of Mahakashyapa.</p><p>prasenjita said, "I don't understand what is happening... why this
man laughed."</p><p>Gautam Buddha said, "He laughed because you could not understand my
third request to drop it. I wanted you to drop your ego. I am not
concerned with lotus flowers, not concerned with diamonds. I only am
concerned with one thing, your ego. Unless you drop it, you have not
dropped anything. And I cannot accept your diamond or your lotus flower,
because that will enhance and nourish your ego.</p><p>"That's why Mahakashyapa laughed because the poor emperor does not
understand the language of a mystic -- but he understood it. In ten
thousand sannyasins he was the only one who understood what I meant --
and he laughed. I have chosen him to be the first for a new stream of
seekers, so he is the founder of Zen."</p><p>Zen was founded in laughter, and for twenty-five centuries the
tradition has continued to produce enlightened people. Most of the
traditions have died but Zen still brings flowers.</p><p>Perhaps, rooted in laughter, it is rooted in the highest
consciousness. Anand Svabhavo.…</p><p>Rabinovich sits down in a cafe and orders a glass of tea and a copy
of PRAVDA.</p><p>"I'll bring the tea," the waiter tells him, "but I can't bring you a
copy of PRAVDA. The Soviet regime has been overthrown and PRAVDA isn't
published anymore" -- PRAVDA is the mouthpiece of the Communist Party of
the Soviet Union.</p><p>"All right," says Rabinovich, "Just bring me the tea."</p><p>The next day Rabinovich comes to the same cafe and asks for tea and a
copy of PRAVDA. The waiter gives him the same answer.</p><p>On the third day, Rabinovich again orders tea and PRAVDA. This time
the waiter says to him, "Look, sir, you seem to be an intelligent man.
For the past three days you've ordered a copy of PRAVDA, and three times
now I've had to tell you that the Soviet regime has been overthrown, and
PRAVDA isn't published anymore."</p><p>"I know, I know," says Rabinovich. "But I just like to hear it." Two
Jews sat in a coffee house discussing the fate of their people.</p><p>"How miserable is our lot," said one. "Pogroms, plagues, quotas,
discrimination, and Adolf Hitler... Sometimes I think we'd be better off
if we'd never been born."</p><p>"Sure," said his friend. "But who has that much luck -- maybe one in
fifty thousand?"</p><p>Try to get it!</p><p>It was at the office Christmas party. As they lay on the office
reception couch in the darkened room, their breath came hot and
fast.</p><p>"Oh, Melvin, oh Melvin," she said passionately, "You've never made
love to me like this before. Is it because of the holiday spirit?"</p><p>"No," he panted. "It is probably because I am not Melvin!"</p><p>It is possible, when you have a hearty laugh, mind stops, because
mind cannot laugh. It is structured seriously, its function is to be
serious, miserable, sick. The moment you laugh, it does not come from
your mind, it comes from the beyond, from your very inner spirit.</p><p>According to me, all the religions have missed one of the dimensions
of the greatest importance, a sense of humor. And they have made the
whole world serious.</p><p>I want my people to fill the world with laughter, joy, songs, and
dances. We are not seeking for any paradise -- we are seeking how to
create the paradise, herenow, because we are not interested in things
after death. If we can create a paradise herenow, certainly we will be
able -- even if we meet in hell -- to create the paradise there.</p><p>All my people are condemned by all the religions, so I hope we will
be reaching hell. But they are to be warned, "Don't send my people to
hell, because they will turn the hell into a far better paradise than
you have with your old, dirty and dry saints who cannot even smile!"</p><p>I trust absolutely that when a million sannyasins enter into hell
with their guitars and songs and dances and jokes the whole quality and
the whole atmosphere of hell is going to be changed -- I think even the
devil will join you! He will become a sannyasin: Swami Anand Devil!</p><p>Okay, Maneesha?

question itself does not arise.</p><p>Love is a meditation and meditation blossoms in love. Of course when
I use the word</p><p>`love' I don't mean the love that ordinarily is understood by the
word, I don't mean the biological infatuation -- anyway it is not love.
It is simply your chemistry, not you which feels attracted, and under
the chemistry's illusion you think you are in love. But that kind of
love every animal, every bird knows perfectly well.</p><p>Only man seems to be deluded, and deluded so much that all the
animals in the world except man have a certain season when they are
infatuated -- their season of reproduction, a very limited period in the
year when biology overtakes them, makes them completely blind; forces
them almost against their will. Have you seen two animals making love?
And have you ever seen them smiling? They look so bored that how to get
out of it seems to be the only problem that is troubling them.</p><p>The whole year they look more relaxed, more at ease, more in tune
with nature and with themselves, but when the reproduction season comes
they all start looking sad, serious, saintly. They forget their
playfulness; they forget their freedom. Suddenly they feel themselves
under a kind of hypnotic trance; in fact, it is a chemical trance.</p><p>That's why scientists are able to change sexes very easily. A man can
become a woman, a woman can become a man -- just a very small change, a
change in the hormones, in the chemistry of their bodies. Just a few
more hormones and the woman will start growing a mustache and beard.</p><p>Now there are many people in the world who have changed their sexes.
Sometimes it has happened automatically because man consists of both,
man and woman. Something is contributed by your father, something is
contributed by your mother, so you are both: your father and your
mother, part man, part woman. Whichever is more in percentage, perhaps
sixty percent man and forty percent woman, then you are man or it may be
otherwise, then you are a woman.</p><p>This percentage of hormones can be changed just by giving you
injections. And in the developed countries there are already men who
have been born as women, and women who have changed to men. But in the
beginning the very idea came to mind because once in a while there was
an accidental case. For example, in</p><p>the very beginning of this century in London there was a case. A man
fell in love with a woman and he married the woman. But after the
marriage he was very much amazed that the woman slowly started changing
into a man.</p><p>After a year he was so much ashamed because the whole town was
laughing at him: his woman had turned completely into a man. He went to
the court for divorce. The court was puzzled; there had never been a
case like that before the court. And the man was perfectly reasonable.
He said, "I married a woman; I have never married a man. Why should I
marry a man? Obviously the marriage is canceled; in fact, I don't need
any divorce, but just not to be illegal, I am asking for divorce."</p><p>His wife was sent for a medical examination. There was no need
because she had a mustache and beard; her breasts had disappeared. There
was not much need, but not taking any chances the judge said, "Let her
be medically examined. If the doctor's report says she has become a man
then there is no question, your divorce is accepted."</p><p>That gave the idea to the scientists that perhaps the woman has a
very small difference between her male hormones and female hormones.
Perhaps she is fifty-one percent woman, forty-nine percent man, and by
some change, climate, food, some medicine... it can be anything that has
altered the proportion between man and woman in her. The difference was
very slight, very borderline, and she became a man.</p><p>This opened a door of great research, and it was found that every man
can become a woman and every woman can become a man.</p><p>This reminds me that in the East, from the very beginning, almost
ten-thousand- year-old statues are available in which Shiva and his
wife, Parvati, are represented as one personality: half man, half woman.
It is a beautiful aesthetic and artistic sculpture, and that's how it
has been thought always: a beautiful metaphor, but nobody has thought of
it as a reality.</p><p>The people who created that statue must have come to know that every
man is carrying a woman within him and every woman is carrying a man
within her -- and this change is not impossible.</p><p>My own feeling is that in the future many more people will be
changing -- because why not have both the experiences in one life? Most
intelligent people</p><p>will change -- the unintelligent always are afraid of any change --
otherwise, you have lived as a woman for thirty years, now it is time,
why not have a look from the other side? Why go on living on this bank?
The scenery from the other side is also very beautiful.</p><p>Only then will the old idea of the poets that the woman is a mystery
will be solved. You can become a woman and know what the mystery is. You
can become a man and know what the mystery is. There is no mystery at
all; it is just a poetic conception. The difference is only biological,
chemical, hormonal.</p><p>I don't call that kind of infatuation love; I call it lust. And to be
confused between lust and love has created your problem.</p><p>You are asking, "Is it possible to experience love and meditation at
the same time?" Lust and meditation you cannot experience at the same
time.</p><p>Lust is against meditation. It is desire, an ugly desire.</p><p>It takes you towards unconsciousness.</p><p>Meditation is the greatest longing, the only longing which cannot be
called a desire. And it takes you upwards towards more
consciousness.</p><p>Now both things you cannot do -- going upwards towards more conscious
being and going downward towards more unconscious being; you cannot do
them both at the same time.</p><p>But love and meditation are both reaching towards higher states of
being. Meditation is a state of thoughtlessness, a state of silence,
serenity, tranquility -- a state of blissfulness.</p><p>There is no reason why love should be against it. Out of blissfulness
love will flow. In fact, only a meditative person can be a loving
person, and only a loving person can be meditative, because both are
going beyond the unconscious mind, the dark mind, the blind mind, and
opening the doors of light and the beyond.</p><p>They are different names and their different names have a certain
meaning and significance. Meditation is possible even if you are alone.
In fact, it is possible</p><p>only when you are alone, in your aloneness, utter purity... no crowd
of thoughts or emotions or feelings, just a flame of being
conscious.</p><p>Meditation is the discovery of your own self.</p><p>But once you have discovered the treasure a tremendous need arises in
you to share it.</p><p>That sharing is love. Meditation is like the sun and love is like the
radiation reaching to faraway flowers to open, for birds to sing, to
make the whole living world alive, fresh, rejuvenated. Exactly what the
sun is doing to the whole solar system, meditation does to the whole
human world: it radiates love.</p><p>And if meditation does not radiate love then one is in some fallacy.
What he is thinking is meditation is not meditation. It may be
concentration, it may be contemplation, but it is not meditation.</p><p>Concentration is of the mind, one pointedness of the mind.
Contemplation is also of the mind, not one pointedness but one subject
matter. If you are thinking about light you go on thinking about light,
higher and deeper and more possibilities and implications of light; but
you keep track of one dimension.</p><p>So we can define contemplation as thinking in one single dimension,
not going astray, not going here and there; not allowing many different
sorts of thoughts but one singular path, moving in the same direction.
Science depends on concentration and philosophy depends on
contemplation. Religion depends on meditation.</p><p>Meditation is when mind is not functioning at all, when mind is
absolutely silent and still, as if absent. In this absentness of mind
your authentic being surfaces. Your mask disappears and your original
face is encountered for the first time.</p><p>For the first time you know who you are.</p><p>And this experience of oneself is the experience of one's divineness.
Out of this divineness radiates love. It is not addressed to anyone in
particular; it simply radiates to friend and to foe, to the familiar and
to the stranger; it does not know any discrimination.</p><p>When the sun rises it does not rise only for roses and not for
marigolds. It does</p><p>not rise only for rich people and not for the poor. It does not rise
only for the strong and not for the weak. It rises unaddressed. It
radiates in all directions. Whoever has eyes will be able to see it.
Having eyes simply means whoever is receptive, whoever is sensitive will
be able to see it. The sun does not rise only for the blind.</p><p>Only a blind man can pass a man of meditation without feeling his
love. I mean spiritually blind, one who does not have any idea of who is
within his being; who knows himself according to others, what they say.
His knowledge of himself is nothing but a collection of opinions of
other people. He does not know himself directly, immediately; and
because he does not know himself he remains closed; otherwise it was not
possible to crucify Jesus.</p><p>Those who crucified Jesus must have been spiritually blind. The man
was absolutely innocent, and he was full of love. He had not harmed
anyone; in fact, he was trying to help everyone. But it is a strange
world. Here there are more blind people than those who have eyes. And
because the people who have eyes and receptivity are in a minority they
remain silent. It is very unfortunate that the blind are very articulate
and those who have eyes, seeing that the majority are blind, remain
silent. They go on seeing that Socrates is being poisoned by the blind
and they don't protest.</p><p>In my eyes the people who poisoned Socrates or crucified Jesus or
murdered Mansoor or assassinated Sarmad, they were less responsible than
those who knew that what was happening was absolutely wrong but remained
silent out of fear.</p><p>There is a beautiful incident...</p><p>When Al-Hillaj Mansoor, a Mohammedan mystic, was being very
primitively assassinated... Jesus' crucifixion is far more
sophisticated; Socrates' poisoning is even more sophisticated, but
nobody has suffered as much as Al-Hillaj Mansoor. First they cut his
legs -- they killed him piece by piece, just to torture him as much as
possible, to the optimum -- then they cut his hands. Then they destroyed
his eyes with hot iron rods --</p><p>they went on piece by piece.</p><p>Thousands of people had gathered to watch. Al-Hillaj Mansoor's
master, Junnaid, a famous teacher, was also present. Of course he was
absolutely against</p><p>what was happening, but the weakness of the good... Seeing the
majority he remained silent. He knew that Mansoor was born after
thousands of years; he was one of the rarest flowers.</p><p>Junnaid had been a teacher of thousands, but none of his students,
none of his disciples had reached to the same heights as Mansoor -- all
this he understood.</p><p>People were throwing stones before the assassination began. He did
not want people to know that he was not throwing stones, so instead of
throwing a stone he threw a roseflower, just to show that he had thrown.
Now in thousands of stones, who can find out what he had thrown? People
saw that he had thrown something.</p><p>But Mansoor could see. When thousands of stones were falling on him,
hitting him, and blood was flowing all over his body, he could see that
a roseflower also fell on his face.</p><p>And he knew that this roseflower could only be thrown by his master
Junnaid. He shouted from his cross, "Junnaid, these thousands of stones
are not hurting me so much as your roseflower; it has created a wound in
my very soul."</p><p>This statement is tremendous: "Thousands of stones have not hurt me.
These are people who don't know me -- but you know me; I had grown under
your shadow. Still, instead of protesting, you are so cowardly that you
are afraid that if you don't throw something people may start suspecting
that you may be a friend..." And tears came to his eyes.</p><p>And Mansoor said, "These tears are not for these stones; these stones
are not worth my tears. These tears are for the man who has thrown the
roseflower to me."</p><p>And still Junnaid remained silent.…</p><p>The good man is responsible. The silent man, the man who has
understood is responsible for all that has happened in the history of
man against the people who were just pure love, pure silence, pure
godliness.</p><p>But perhaps nothing can be said to those good people either, because
if they had come out there would have been another assassination and
nothing else. That's what Junnaid said afterwards, and he was right.
Other disciples asked him, "It</p><p>was very shameful when he called out your name. You behaved as if you
were not Junnaid. It is shameful that you did not protest when your
greatest disciple was being tortured -- tortured brutally."</p><p>No, even animals don't torture in that way. If you want to kill
someone, kill. But to cut him piece by piece is so condemnable.</p><p>The other disciples said, "You should have protested."</p><p>Junnaid said, "Do you think it would have saved him? I have also
thought about it. It is not that I have not felt the tragedy, I have
felt as much hurt as Mansoor. I loved him, but I knew that if I had come
out and protested, then instead of one man, two men would have been
assassinated. Nothing would have been achieved by it."</p><p>But still I feel it would have been better that two men were
assassinated instead of one. I differ from Junnaid, because there may
have been a third man who would have come out, and three men may have
provoked courage in many more. It is not that in that vast crowd there
was only Junnaid who saw that it was absolutely inhuman and ugly -- and
there was no crime. The crime was simply that Al-Hillaj Mansoor had
said, "I am God," ana'l haq, and simultaneously he said, "It is not that
only I am God -- you are also. I know it; you still have to know it.
That's the only difference."</p><p>So he was not speaking because of his ego, he was speaking because of
his experience.</p><p>He was not denying godhood to anyone. He was simply saying, "Your God
seems to be asleep; my God is awake. One day it was also asleep and I
was as ignorant as you are.</p><p>One day you will be also as awake as I am. It is only a difference of
time."</p><p>Such a compassionate man. Why has humanity behaved so badly with
these people? One of the reasons, fundamental reasons is that their
height hurts people's egos. Their silence, their love, their beauty,
their grace, their blissfulness... Everything hurts people, because they
are living in dark holes, in misery, in suffering, in anguish, and
somebody is standing on the hilltop, sunlit, surrounded by fragrant
flowers. They cannot forgive such a man.</p><p>This is something to be deeply understood and remembered, that up
till now man has proved by and large barbarous. All talk of civilization
is nonsense. All talk of culture, Hindu, Mohammedan, Christian, is
simply bullshit. Because the way we have behaved with our best sons and
daughters is not cultured, is not human. It is subhuman or perhaps even
below animals.</p><p>No animal murders another animal of his own species. No lion will
kill another lion, howsoever hungry; he would rather die than kill. But
man is the only animal again. He is unique in many ways: he is the only
one who kills people of his own species -- not only kills but eats.</p><p>Just a few days ago in Palestine the people demanded from the
government, "We should be allowed to eat the dead people because there
is a shortage of food -- and it seems utterly uneconomical not to eat
the dead people." Their demand was ugly but more ugly is that the
Palestinian government has accepted their demand, saying that it is
okay. The government cannot supply food. On what grounds can it deny
them?</p><p>First they will start eating people who died naturally and then they
will start eating people who have been killed on purpose. That has
happened in Buddhist countries: in China, in Japan, in Korea, in Taiwan.
You will find hotels where it is written, "Here only the meat of the
naturally dead animals is available." Now so many natural deaths of
animals don't happen anywhere in the world that they can supply food for
the whole country. How many animals do you see dying naturally?</p><p>Those boards are absolutely false, as false as you will find in
India. Every restaurant, hotel, sweetshop... they will all have a board
saying, "Only pure ghee is used here." And everywhere vegetable ghee
made by vegetables, not by milk, and sometimes even by rotten
vegetables, not even the best quality vegetables, is available. From
where can they get so much pure ghee? You cannot even get pure milk.</p><p>I was a postgraduate student and the man who used to supply the milk
to all the students in the hostel was known as a very saintly man; he
was really called Santa Baba, because everybody thought, He is so
honest; he is supplying pure milk. He always used to come with his son,
carrying the milk.</p><p>I heard him many times. If somebody asked "Santa Baba, is the milk
really</p><p>pure?" He would immediately put his hand on his son's head and say,
"If I have mixed water in the milk my son will die."</p><p>Naturally people thought... I heard it many times. I started thinking
that there must be some clue to the mystery, because I used to take his
milk and I knew it was not pure. It was so thin that it was more water
than milk. One day I took him aside and I said to him,</p><p>"No need of your son... and no need for you to put your hand on his
head. You just tell me one thing. Is it really true?"</p><p>For a moment he was silent and then he said, "It is not true." I
said, "You are every day offering your son."</p><p>He said, "It is very simple. I never mix water into milk; I always
mix milk into water. So I am not making any wrong statement."</p><p>You cannot get anything pure.</p><p>I have heard about Mulla Nasruddin, that he wanted to commit suicide.
So he went and got poison with great difficulty from a chemist. He had
to bribe him because from where would he get the prescription for
poison? Without the prescription the chemist said, "I cannot give you
anything; you have to have a doctor's prescription."</p><p>He said, "Who is going to give me the prescription? I want to commit
suicide. You take these one hundred rupees or two hundred rupees,
because I am going to die. What am I going to do with the rupees
afterwards?"</p><p>So he bribed him, went very happily home, mixed the poison in the
milk, drank it, slept, waited and waited and waited, and there was no
death coming, not even sleep! Many times he woke up, looked all around
-- whether he was in hell or heaven... but his wife was snoring by his
side.</p><p>He said, "My God, how long is this poison going to take? The chemist
was saying the moment you put it on your tongue you are gone..."</p><p>And it was becoming morning. The whole night he had been waiting.
Morning came and his wife was still snoring by his side. He rushed to
the chemist -- he</p><p>was just opening the doors of his shop -- and asked him, "What is the
matter?"</p><p>He said, "What can I do? You know, in this country you cannot find
anything pure.</p><p>Everything is mixed. In a way it is good; nobody can commit suicide
-- at least by taking poison."</p><p>A man of love is really the only man who is cultured, who is
civilized. And such a love arises only as a fragrance of meditation;
hence my insistence on meditation. Unless we turn people towards
meditation on a vaster scale -- as it has never been done before --</p><p>there is not much hope for the future, for future humanity.</p><p>But I am not a pessimist, not a single inch. I am an absolute
optimist. I will believe to the very last moment when the world is
committing suicide in a world war, to the last moment I will trust that
man will wake up. Seeing such a tremendous tragedy ahead, how can people
remain asleep?</p><p>Now there are only two alternatives: either suicide or meditation.
Life has brought us to such a point where there are not many roads; just
two roads, two possibilities, simple choice. Either humanity chooses to
commit suicide under the leadership of Ronald Reagan, or humanity
chooses to meditate, to be silent, to be peaceful, to be human, to be
loving.</p><p>Only through meditation can we defeat the politicians -- and the
politicians need to be totally defeated. Their power has to be destroyed
forever. Their nuclear weapons and their atomic weapons have to be
thrown in the Atlantic and in the Pacific. And if they want to jump with
them they can jump also, because they are the greatest criminals in the
world.</p><p>Ordinary criminals may murder somebody and you take them to the
gallows. Adolf Hitler kills eight million people, alone. Joseph Stalin
kills one million Russians, his own people, without any difficulty. All
these politicians continue creating more and more weapons to destroy
humanity. And they are the leaders, they are the guides of people.</p><p>With these blind politicians dominating the world there is no
hope.</p><p>I invite the whole humanity, because this is a decisive moment, this
is the time when a great revolution is needed, a revolution against all
politicians, without any discrimination of whether they are socialist,
communist, fascist, capitalist; whether they believe in democracy or
they believe in dictatorship -- it does not matter.</p><p>For the first time all politicians are standing together to destroy
humanity, and if we can make man free from the political jargon... The
only way to free man is to make man loving, peaceful. So he simply drops
the weapons and he says, "They are not needed. We are not going to kill
each other. And if you have so much urge to fight, then the presidents
and the prime ministers can have boxing matches -- and we all will
enjoy. It will be really great."</p><p>What is the need to destroy so many innocent people for a few idiots
who cannot come to a solution; seeing perfectly well that the time is
becoming shorter and shorter and any accident is possible -- and there
will be no humanity at all.</p><p>I have heard that the third world war happened, and a monkey sitting
on a tree says to a female monkey, "Darling, should we start it all
again?" And he has an apple in his hand.</p><p>"Eat it again"... and God will throw you out of the Garden of Eden
and the beginning of another humanity.…</p><p>But that humanity will again end up in some Ronald Reagan -- it won't
be different. The only difference that can be called a difference is the
difference of consciousness. And meditation is nothing but a science of
creating that difference.</p><p>You are asking, "Is it possible to experience love and meditation at
the same time?"</p><p>And I am saying to you: Love is only possible if meditation is
possible. They are both two wings of the same bird. And if you want the
bird to fly high in the sky of consciousness, both the wings are needed,
love and meditation, but not your kind of love.</p><p>You should remember the difference between your kind of love and the
love I'm talking about.</p><p>The husband and wife were having a terrible argument. Finally the
wife threw up her arms and exclaimed, "Why did I have to marry you to
find out how stupid you are?"</p><p>"You did not have to," replied the husband angrily. "You should have
known it the minute I asked you."</p><p>Who is going to ask you except a stupid person! That very moment it
was clear, there was no need for so many years to wait to find out. I am
not talking about this love.</p><p>The new fully-automatic airplane was making its first cross-country
flight. A recorded announcement said, "This is the first all-automatic
jet. There is no pilot, no crew. Press a button and we take off. Press
another button and dinner is served. Press another button and we land.
Nothing can go wrong... can go wrong... can go wrong... can go wrong
"</p><p>And we are sitting on a volcano of nuclear weapons -- and everything
can go wrong! Just press a button...</p><p>Your question is not only a personal question. It has now become a
question for the whole of humanity, the whole earth. But unfortunately,
in five billion people it is difficult to find even a few hundred people
who are sincerely interested in finding what meditation is -- not by
studying about it but by experiencing it.</p><p>Time is running short. Every moment we are coming closer to a
situation which may be deliberately created or may be just accidental.
We have known the experience a few days ago. In France something went
wrong; in Russia something went wrong. You cannot trust machines. Man
has not trusted man but he has trusted machines more.</p><p>You will be surprised to know that in Japan, which is the most
technologically advanced country in the world today -- it has left
America far behind Its</p><p>currency is now the most valuable; the dollar rates second. In
America the greatest rich man has only four and a half billion dollars.
In Japan the richest man has twenty-one billion dollars. And Japan is
the only country where thousands of robots, mechanical men, are
functioning and working in the factories. They are cheap, because they
don't get temperamental, they don't go on strike, they don't ask for
wages. The question of a pay rise does not arise.</p><p>They work twenty-four hours a day with no shift change.</p><p>But suddenly, last month a strange thing happened -- that's what I
call an accident. In one factory five persons were killed by the robot
mechanical men; something went berserk.</p><p>Those robots simply grabbed the people who were passing by, gave them
a good hug --</p><p>finished. Engineers could not believe what was happening, "Is it some
kind of love that has arisen in the heart of the robot?"</p><p>And not only one, five robots in one factory -- just in one day. And
from that day people are keeping far away. Even engineers are looking
from far away because to come close if the robot falls in love with
you... Then just a good hug, and you are finished. I am not talking
about this kind of love.</p><p>Man also does this kind of love, not only robots. If you watch men...
How many men have killed how many women although they are alive? How
many men have been killed by women although they are alive, but just
alive, breathing, surviving? But they don't know any life. Love has
destroyed their life. This is not the love I am talking about.</p><p>Love should enhance life, make it richer and more beautiful and more
blissful. Lovers should give more freedom to each other, more
individuality, more dignity. But what is happening for centuries is just
the opposite. Lovers are trying to dominate each other, to destroy each
other, to enslave each other. I am not talking about that love. That
love cannot go with meditation.</p><p>"My wife thinks she is a chicken," the husband explained to the
psychiatrist. "That's a serious delusion," was the reply. "How long has
this been going on?" "Three years," mumbled the husband.</p><p>"Three years?" said the shocked shrink. "Why did you not bring her in
before now?"</p><p>"Well," replied the embarrassed husband, "frankly, we needed the
eggs."</p><p>This is going on with almost every couple; they are driving each
other crazy. This is not love. If this is love then what is hate?</p><p>The very idea of domination, the very desire to be powerful over
others shows a poverty of soul. It shows that you don't have power over
yourself; hence the desire to have power over others.</p><p>That's why I say the politician is the poorest person in the world,
because his desire is to have power over millions of people. This desire
shows his poverty. He has no power over himself and he wants to have
power. But it does not matter... he may have power over one person or
one million people or one billion people -- it does not matter. His
inner feeling of inferiority, that he has no power within himself will
remain the same. He can deceive the world but he cannot deceive
himself.</p><p>That's the difference between the politician and the religious
person. The religious person searches for power over himself, and the
politician searches for power over others. The politician is bound to be
violent, destructive, ugly, barbarous.</p><p>Only a man who wants to be the power over himself, who wants to know
where the source of his life is, from where he is getting his energy,
where the life and energy source within him are...</p><p>The search for it is meditation. Finding it is enlightenment.</p><p>And once you have found it you have so much, in such abundance, that
you cannot help sharing it. You become a rain cloud which wants to
shower on the thirsty earth. And you must have smelled the sweet
fragrance that comes from the thirsty earth, from the first rain cloud's
shower on it, in gratitude, in thankfulness.</p><p>A man of meditation like Gautam Buddha showers his love -- he is a
rain cloud, or better to call him a love cloud, who showers his love to
all those who are thirsty, to all those who are aware that love is
showering.</p><p>But the majority are so foolish, they immediately open their
umbrellas. They protect themselves from love, they protect themselves
from Gautam Buddhas,</p><p>they protect themselves from Socrates... Strange people. Something is
basically wrong, and that is, they don't know themselves and they don't
know their thirst and they don't know what nourishment they need.</p><p>Love is the nourishment that is missing in the world.</p><p>Yussel Moscowitz had lost all interest in life, so he went to see his
psychiatrist. The usually patient shrink decided to use shock tactics
this time and said sharply, "What would happen if I cut off your left
ear?"</p><p>"I could not hear," replied Yussel with a sigh.</p><p>"Then what would happen if I cut off your right ear?" barked the
shrink. "I could not see," said Yussel, beginning to show signs of
boredom.</p><p>The psychiatrist became alarmed. "This is serious. Why do you say you
could not see if I cut off your right ear?"</p><p>"Because," said Yussel with a yawn, "my hat would fall over my eyes.
Both the ears gone, how can I see?"</p><p>The people you think are psychiatrists, psychologists,
psychoanalysts, the people who are helping humanity to become more sane,
are the most insane people in the world. The statistics are very clear.
From no other profession do so many people go mad as from the profession
of psychiatry. The proportion is double that from any other
profession.</p><p>In the past the professors used to be champions of going mad; now
they are number two.</p><p>Number one is the psychologists. They commit suicide four times more
than any other profession -- and these are the people who are helping
humanity to be sane, normal, healthy, intelligent. These are the people
supposed to teach you how to live and how to live joyously. These are
the people who claim that their function is to teach the art of
living.</p><p>But if these people are going to teach the art of living it is going
to be a really dangerous art of living. It will not be the art of
living, it will be the art of at the most vegetating.</p><p>The professor asked the young girl in his psychology class, "Which
part of the body expands to ten times its natural size under an
emotional impact?"</p><p>Blushing, the girl replied, "I would rather not answer that."</p><p>The professor called on the boy sitting next to her who promptly
replied, "The pupil of the eye."</p><p>The professor turned back to the girl and said, "Your confusion shows
three things. One, that you did not do your homework; two, that you have
a dirty mind; and three, that one day you will be sadly
disappointed."</p><p>Okay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.</p><p>The Invitation Chapter #29</p><p>Chapter title: The crescendo of the insanity of centuries 5 September

also remember: Old age is when getting it up gets you down.</p><p>You have certainly entered into the age when people will call to you,
"How wonderful you are looking."</p><p>The eyes of the dead are closed gently; we also have to open gently
the eyes of the living.</p><p>I will try my best to be gentle with you because you must be
dreaming: women never become old; it has never been heard of.</p><p>You are not aware of a very fundamental law: When you are up to your
nose, keep your mouth shut.</p><p>And never forget that money can't buy happiness, but it can buy you
the kind of misery you prefer.</p><p>In old age certainly one wants to be happy, but nothing can buy
happiness. In old age people have money, but money can buy only the
misery you prefer, not happiness.</p><p>So I think, Devageet, it is better still to wait. Two days is not a
long time, you can come back. It is dangerous to be old. Start falling
in love with someone, and old age will disappear. That is one of the
strategies to drop old age.…</p><p>A man in love is incomplete -- that's true -- until he has married.
Then he is finished.</p><p>So just don't get married. Always remain in love, and you will be
young. The moment you are married then I cannot help.</p><p>The only thing to remember about women is: A man who moralizes is
really a hypocrite, and a woman who moralizes is invariably ugly.</p><p>Just avoid the moralizing women!</p><p>It is simply human to err -- and that's what you have done, fallen
into a human error -- but the law is: To err is human, but to make a
real mess of things you need a computer.</p><p>One who dares to be a fool should remember that that is the first
step in the direction of wisdom.</p><p>You have the intrinsic capacity to become wise, but only two-day-old,
not very old.</p><p>If you have really become old, you will come to know sex is
hereditary. If your parents never had it, chances are you won't
either.</p><p>Socialism is when the state owns everything; capitalism is when your
wife does.</p><p>And this is a tremendously significant maxim to remember as far as
old people are concerned: Whenever you feel the urge to exercise, just
lie down and wait until it passes.</p><p>If you have really become old just have a look at your passport. If
you actually look like your passport photo, you are not well enough to
travel.</p><p>Devageet, you are perfectly young. Just to avoid women you are trying
to play that you are old. That is not new. In my commune every sannyasin
plays old. This is a very different world: outside men are chasing
women; in my commune women chase men.</p><p>Outside women have headaches; in the commune men have headaches. They
look so much worried and afraid that some woman is going to get them --
and most often the woman succeeds.</p><p>It is good that you understand that two days ago you became old.
Remain old!</p><p>A big Yorkshire farmer found it necessary to go to London for several
months and decided to leave one of his best workers in charge: "I want
you to take care of things, Harry, as if I were here myself,
understand?"</p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>Four months later the boss farmer returned to find everything in
shape. Harry, pointing things out said, "The chicks have been laying
plenty of eggs, the wheat has grown double strong, the vegetables are
better than they have ever been, and as for those monthly spells your
daughter used to have, I have even got those stopped."</p><p>Devageet's old age is the same. Let him remain old but don't believe
his old age. He can get anybody's monthly problem stopped. He is simply
pretending to be old.</p><p>Question 2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>AM I MOVING RIGHTLY OR AM I JUST A HOPELESS NUTCASE?</p><p>Premnath, your question is very significant, because in this world
everybody is moving rightly except the nuts -- at least that's what the
whole humanity believes.</p><p>The reality is just the contrary: the whole of humanity is a nutcase,
and only a few nuts escape from this madhouse you call the world.</p><p>It happened once...</p><p>Kahlil Gibran's one friend became mad. He was a very great poet,
thinker of a high caliber, a genius. When Kahlil Gibran heard he came
back to Lebanon. He was born in Lebanon, he was brought up in Lebanon,
he was a Lebanese. But then he went to America and he spent his whole
life in America.</p><p>Hearing about his friend in Lebanon he came back to see him; he went
to the madhouse.</p><p>His friend was sitting alone in the park of the madhouse on a bench.
He looked at Kahlil Gibran but did not pay much attention, did not even
show that he has recognized him.</p><p>Kahlil Gibran said, "Don't you recognize me?"</p><p>He said, "I recognize everybody. But what are you doing here? With
great difficulty I have been able to leave that mad world and enter into
this peaceful place. What are you doing here?"</p><p>And Kahlil Gibran writes in his diary, "It shocked me, but he was
making a very significant point. He was saying that only the madhouse
seems to be sane, and outside the madhouse everybody is insane."</p><p>At least in the madhouse nobody worries, nobody is ambitious to
become a president or a prime minister, nobody is concerned to become
the richest man, nobody has any ambition. People are enjoying
moment-to-moment life. You may not like their way of doing it, you may
not like their way of enjoying it, but that is your problem not their
problem. In the madhouse nobody has any problem</p><p>except the doctors who are running here and there worried and
concerned. The mad people don't have any worry in the world; they are
just at ease as they are. They are in a tremendous acceptability.</p><p>It happened in one madhouse...</p><p>The old doctor retired and a new doctor came. So there was a farewell
party and a welcome party also for the new doctor. The old doctor who
was retiring spoke first.</p><p>There was not a single clap. Nobody laughed, nobody seemed even to
hear him or what he was talking about. There was utter silence as if
there was nobody present. And when the new doctor stood up people
clapped, enjoyed, a few people started dancing...</p><p>The new doctor said, "This is strange. The old doctor who has served
them his whole life is retiring, and they remain completely silent; they
did not even clap once."</p><p>So when the meeting was over he asked a madman, "What is the matter?
Why did you misbehave with the old man? You clapped for me and you don't
know me at all."</p><p>They all said, "The reality is, you look just like one of us. We were
so happy to find you.</p><p>That man was a problem. He was continuously worried -- and here
nobody is worried; things are running very smoothly."</p><p>No war, no murder, no suicide -- and it is one of the strangest
things that mad people rarely fall sick. If they are sick they become
healthy. Mad people are healthy people, because all the problems that
can create mental tension and can affect your body are no longer there.
Their bodies are natural, and they become innocent like children.</p><p>The new doctor was very much shocked when he heard the real reason
for their clapping and joyous shouts and why a few started dancing. When
he heard that they thought that he was one of them, he looked a little
crazy.</p><p>In fact, one of the great psychologists, Adler, has created a
psychology around</p><p>will to power. And one day he was in his class. He said to his
disciples who he was preparing for the new psychology, "The people who
become teachers are the people who want to dominate others, and that is
the easiest way to dominate; small children cannot do anything much
about it. The people who become politicians suffer from inferiority
complex. To hide that they try to magnify their ego as much as they can
-- until it bursts."</p><p>And he was explaining about every kind of profession -- why people
choose a certain profession. One young man stood up and he said, "You
have left one profession out completely, the profession of the
psychologist."</p><p>Adler was silent. He could not answer because the answer was clear.
The student said,</p><p>"Perhaps you cannot say it, but I will have to say to complete the
list. The people who tend to become psychologists are people who are
psychologically sick."</p><p>In fact, neurotics, psychotics, all kinds of nuts, enter into the
world of psychology. That is the most beautiful hiding place they can
find. They become experts about madness, but deep down they are mad
people. I have studied the lives of psychologists and I have been really
surprised that these people should have been in madhouses. They are
treating mad people, and they are the most highly paid profession in the
world.</p><p>You are asking, "Am I moving rightly or am I just a hopeless
nutcase?" Everybody is a nutcase but nobody is hopeless. The world has
unfortunately been growing for thousands of years in such a way that it
has turned everybody into a nutcase. There are two kinds of nuts: normal
and abnormal.</p><p>The normal nuts run the whole world. They are doctors, they are
professors, they are engineers; deep down the madness is there, but
within limits. Everybody is on the boundary line. Just a small incident,
a small accident, and they can go beyond the boundary line: the wife
dies, the business goes bankrupt -- anything can happen and the boundary
line can be crossed, they immediately become nutcases.</p><p>The psychologists of the whole world are only trying to do one thing:
to make abnormal nuts normal, somehow to bring them back within the
boundary line. It does not help the nutcases, but it helps the world to
go on running in its common way.</p><p>But why has it happened that so many people in the world are either
mad or just on the boundary line? There is not any qualitative
difference, but only a quantitative difference, a difference of degrees.
We have been brought up with mother's milk, with all kinds of
superstitions; they have gone deep into our unconscious.</p><p>I used to live in a city for a few months. Just in front of me there
was a municipal water tap. And the man had the idea that while he was
filling his pot with the water, if a woman passed by, that water had
become dirty. He would immediately throw the water and he would start
filling it again.</p><p>One day I was watching. "What is the matter?" I asked the man. He
said, "According to my religion women are -- even their shadow is dirty,
and I cannot drink dirty water."</p><p>I managed to find a woman and paid her so that I could tell her,
"Tomorrow you go on walking and let us see how long his religion
lasts."</p><p>But that man was also a man of great courage, because the whole
day... The woman got tired, but I was paying her so she managed to
continue. She went away for some time to eat; she sent her daughter to
replace... The evening came but the man continued to throw away the
water because the woman had come.</p><p>Finally it was too much. He threw the pot and came directly to me,
because he understood what was happening. And he said, "You will drive
me crazy!"</p><p>I said, "You are crazy. Nobody can drive you crazy. The very idea you
are carrying that even the shadow of the woman makes things dirty... You
are born of a woman, so you are dirty. For nine months you have been
within the womb of a woman, and you have not even thought for a single
moment what kind of a stupid idea you are carrying. Nobody can drive you
crazy. I am trying to drive you sane. So remember, from tomorrow this
superstition is not going to happen again; otherwise... I get paid
enough, and I am alone --</p><p>I will keep a woman constantly on duty so that whenever you are on
the tap she has just to walk there. Or she can just stand there, why
walk?"</p><p>The man said, "Then something will have to be done."</p><p>And he did; he changed neighborhood. That very night he escaped from
the</p><p>neighborhood. I tried to find where he had gone. I was in search, but
the city was big.</p><p>Somebody who knew him told me, "Don't waste your time. He has left
the city itself because he knows you will not leave him easily; wherever
he goes, you can appoint a woman to walk... And without the water he
cannot cook his food, he cannot eat his food, he cannot drink water. You
were killing him."</p><p>But he was not thought mad, because in the neighborhood in which he
was living everybody had that superstition. He was just poor; others had
their own running water.</p><p>That poor man did not have his own bathroom, his own running water,
so he was using the corporation water. But they all believed that he was
right, I was wrong.</p><p>That's why I should disturb people's religions -- these are
religions. If you just watch what kind of religions people have been
brought up in, you will be surprised that they have turned the whole
humanity into an insanity.</p><p>I had once a friend who was a professor, and I have been his student
also. For my postgraduate studies I was his student, and then when I
also became a professor in the same university we became colleagues. But
our friendship was old, since my student days. He had the idea that to
see a woman is the greatest sin. Now he was a well-qualified professor.…
He used to walk with his umbrella covering his eyes, so that he could
see only two or three feet ahead. And he used to run so fast -- his
bungalow and the department were not very far apart. With his umbrella
touching his head he would run almost to his house and lock his house
from inside.</p><p>In the class I was the only male; there were two female students.
There were only three persons in his class. He could not look at women;
it was against his religion which believed that celibacy is the
foundation of religion.</p><p>So he used to teach with closed eyes. Seeing him teach with closed
eyes, I thought this was a good opportunity to have a good sleep. So I
was also sitting with closed eyes.</p><p>Those two girls wondered... and they felt strange also: the teacher
is asleep -- with closed eyes he is speaking; the only male student is
listening with closed eyes.…</p><p>The professor thought that I must be following the same ideology of
celibacy. He was very happy, because in the university he was laughed
at. Now at least there were two persons belonging to the same idea. He
took me aside one day and he said, "You are doing it perfectly well. But
how do you manage on the road? -- because I don't see you carrying the
umbrella."</p><p>I said, "To tell you the truth I don't belong to your madness. I'm
simply sleeping; this is my time to sleep. My whole life I have slept
from twelve to two without any exception."</p><p>Even in school I used to disappear for those two hours. In the
university I used to disappear, and when I became a professor I asked
the vice-chancellor, "These two hours are absolutely sacred to me. You
can give me periods before or after, but these two hours you cannot
touch."</p><p>He said, "What is the matter?"</p><p>I said, "The matter is that these two hours are devoted to sleep. If
you give me a period I will sleep -- and I will tell all the students to
fall asleep, to just keep quiet and silent and enjoy."</p><p>So he gave me periods after two o'clock.</p><p>I told the professor -- Bhattacharya was his name -- "You are under a
wrong impression. I don't believe in such idiotic ideas, because with
your closed eyes you are seeing the woman more. What are you seeing with
your eyes closed? And in fact, why have you closed the eyes? You must
have seen the woman first, then only can you close your eyes.</p><p>And if in seeing a woman your celibacy is disturbed, it is not much
of a celibacy. What will you do in a dream?"</p><p>He said, "You are right. In a dream I cannot do anything. Neither is
the umbrella there...</p><p>and the eyes are already closed -- the women are inside. Do you have
any suggestion?"</p><p>I said, "Because of this umbrella and because of these closed eyes
your dreams are disturbed by women. If you drop this idiotic discipline
that you have</p><p>imposed upon yourself... Women have their own business. Who is
bothering to come into your dreams?"</p><p>He said, "No, my father followed the same ideology, my
forefathers..." -- he was a brahmin from Bengal -- "and I cannot drop
it, although I know the whole university thinks me mad."</p><p>But others have their own madness. It may be different, may not be
detectable if everybody has it, but to be sane there is only one
possibility and that comes out of meditation; otherwise, whatever you do
is going to be insane because it will be coming out of your
unconsciousness. You will not be doing it in your alertness, in your
awareness.</p><p>According to me the madman is one who has fallen completely
unconscious, who has lost even the thin layer of consciousness that you
have. But even the thin layer of consciousness does not prevent you from
behaving insanely.</p><p>You just watch yourself. Just watch your thoughts -- and you will be
amazed what kind of thoughts go on in your mind. Watch your actions,
what kind of actions you go on doing. Are they actions or are they only
reactions?</p><p>A sane man behaves differently. A Gautam Buddha is surrounded by a
crowd which is abusing him, using ugly words, obscene words, because he
is against the organized religion of the Hindus and he is against the
Hindu holy scriptures, the VEDAS. He has criticized them as hard as it
is possible, and they need it. It is not that he is wrong. He has
condemned the whole priesthood, that these are the exploiters,
parasites. Naturally, brahmins were enraged.</p><p>And this was a brahmin village through which he was passing. And the
brahmins surrounded him and said every kind of bad thing that they could
manage. He listened silently. His disciples became angry, but because
Buddha was present it was not courteous to say anything before the
master. The master was standing so silent, and listening as if they are
saying very sweet things.</p><p>Finally Buddha said to them, "If your things that you wanted to say
to me are finished, I would like to reach to the place where people must
be waiting for me. But if your things are not finished, after a few days
when I will be returning I will inform you. And I will have enough time
to listen to all that you want to say."</p><p>One man said, "Do you think we are saying something? We are
condemning you. Do you understand or not? Because anybody else would
become angry, and you are standing silently..."</p><p>The statement that Buddha made to these village people is immensely
significant. He said, "You have come a little too late. If you had come
ten years ago when I was as insane as you are, not a single person would
have gone alive."</p><p>Ten years ago he was a prince, a warrior, one of the best archers of
his time, a great swordsman, and those brahmins... he could simply have
removed their heads with a single blow, without any difficulty. Because
those brahmins know nothing about swords or arrows or being a warrior.
He would have just cut them</p><p>-- almost like vegetables.</p><p>He said, "You have come late. Ten years ago if you had come... but
now I am no longer insane. I cannot react and I would like to ask you
one question. In the last village people came with sweets and fruits and
flowers to receive me, but we take food only one time a day, and we had
already taken the food. And we don't carry things, so we had to tell
them, `You please forgive us, we cannot accept sweets, flowers. We
accept your love, but these things you will have to take away.' I want
to ask you," he said to this angry crowd,</p><p>"what must they have done with their sweets and flowers that they had
brought as presents to us."</p><p>One man said, "What is the problem in it? They must have distributed
the sweets in the village."</p><p>Buddha said, "That makes me very sad. What will you do? -- because I
don't accept what you have brought, just the same way as I did not
accept the sweets and the flowers and other things that the people
brought to me in the other village, if I don't accept your obscenity,
your ugly words, your dirty words, if I don't accept, what can you do?
What are you going to do with all this garbage that you have come with?
You will have to take it back to your homes and give it to your wives,
to your children, to your neighbors.</p><p>"You will have to distribute it, because I simply refuse to take it.
And you cannot make me angry unless I accept your humiliation, your
insult. Ten years ago I was not conscious; if somebody had insulted me
he would have lost his life immediately. I had no idea that insulting me
is his problem, and that I have</p><p>nothing to do with it -- I can simply listen and go on my way."</p><p>This is what I call sanity. Do you think humanity is sane? It only
appears... just superficial sanity, mannerism, etiquette, culture,
civilization, just skin-deep. Scratch a little deeper and the barbarous
comes out.</p><p>If you really want, Premnath, to be a sane being, sannyas is the way
for sanity, for dropping all those unconscious layers of your mind which
force you to behave unconsciously. And in your unconsciousness you are
doing things for which you yourself will repent when you will become a
little alert and aware, "What have I done?"</p><p>The insane person can only react. The sane person acts, the sane
person responds</p><p>-- he never reacts.</p><p>The way is simple and you are at the right place where your mind can
become calm and quiet, so much so, as if it is absent. You should be
certain of your sanity only if you can attain a state of no-mind. Only
then can you be certain that nothing can drive you mad, because the mind
that was possible to become insane is no more -- you have transcended
it.</p><p>I am reminded of an old story...</p><p>Once there was an old couple who lived deep in the forest, and they
never saw anybody else. One day the old husband was walking on a lonely
path when he saw something shining on the ground. He bent down to pick
it up and it was a mirror. But he had never seen a mirror before and
when he saw his own face reflected in it, he thought it was his father's
face. Obviously he had never seen his own face, but he had seen his
father's face.</p><p>So he took it home and placed it up in the attic for safekeeping, and
every evening he would go up and say good night to his father. But his
wife became suspicious about what he was doing in the attic every
evening. So one night she followed him. She saw him looking at the
mirror and saying good night to it... but she had never seen a mirror
before either! So she pushed over to him, grabbed the mirror out of his
hand, looked into it and said, "You old idiot! You mean every night you
come sneaking up here just to say good night to this ugly old
woman?"</p><p>But this is how our mind functions. You don't know your original face
-- and</p><p>there is no mirror which can show you your original face. What you
know as your face is only the face that you have seen reflected in the
mirror; it is a reflection.</p><p>You must have seen in big cities or in exhibitions or in circuses,
there are mirror halls where different kinds of mirrors are arranged: in
some mirrors you become so tall, and in some mirrors you become such a
pygmy; in some mirrors you become so fat, and in some mirrors you become
so thin.…</p><p>I don't think the mirror that you are using can be perfect. It is
very difficult to have a perfect mirror. If by chance you have a mirror
which makes your face look beautiful or ugly, then you will carry that
idea with yourself.</p><p>But you don't know your original face, how it is, directly. It is
only in the state of no-mind that you become aware of your originality,
and that is the only sanity as far as I am concerned -- as far as any
awakened human being has ever been concerned.</p><p>It is by going beyond the mind and entering into the no-mind that you
will attain sanity; otherwise, Premnath, you will remain either a normal
nutcase -- or if you are a little courageous, a little adventurous, you
may go beyond the border, and you will be stamped a madman. And once you
are stamped by the society as a madman you may come back to being
normal, but nobody will ever think that you are normal.</p><p>I used to live with one of my father's sisters while I was in the
college studying. The husband of my father's sister had a brother. He
used to come just to chitchat with me, and I saw every possibility that
he could go beyond the border; just a little push was needed.</p><p>So one day I was talking to him and I told him, "If you are really
religious" -- and he was a very religious fanatic -- "then you should
touch your wife's feet every night before you go to bed."</p><p>He said, "But where is it written?"</p><p>I said, "It is not written. Great principles remain unwritten, they
are transferred from master to disciple."</p><p>But he said, "People will think that I am mad or something. Nobody
touches the</p><p>feet of his wife."</p><p>I said, "Every woman should be taken as your mother; only then you
can be celibate."</p><p>He said, "That's right."</p><p>That night he went home. He touched the feet of his wife and the wife
shrieked and the whole house gathered saying: "What are you doing?"</p><p>And he said, "Every woman is a mother."</p><p>They said, "That's right but that does not mean that you have to
touch the feet of your wife. Don't be stupid!"</p><p>But he became stubborn -- he was a fanatic. He said, "I will touch...
She is my wife, not yours -- and what is wrong in it? I am just paying
my respect."</p><p>His other brothers came to me asking, "What kind of thing have you
told him?"</p><p>I said, "I was just checking whether he could cross the line or not.
I will pull him back.</p><p>Don't be worried."</p><p>But it was really difficult to pull him back. I had to convince him,
"Just for society's sake... You have deep respect, you can touch your
wife's feet when she is asleep in the night. Show your respect; it does
not matter whether she is asleep or awake."</p><p>He said, "That's right. I am getting into trouble; everybody thinks I
am mad."</p><p>He stopped touching the feet but everybody continued to think that he
was a little cuckoo.</p><p>People had never thought that he was cuckoo before when he was doing
the same things.</p><p>Now he is doing the same things and people are suspicious. Once a
suspicion has entered, then it is very difficult to remove it from the
mind of the society.</p><p>And in fact people enjoy it that you are mad and they are not mad.
They provoke your madness once they know that you are vulnerable. Only
one person is not vulnerable to any provocation: he who knows the secret
of meditation.</p><p>A couple went to see a new movie, and the two seats in front of them
were occupied by a man and his dog. When the film was over the dog
applauded enthusiastically. The man behind leaned forward and said,
"That's simply astonishing."</p><p>"Yes, it is," said the dog's companion, "Especially since he hated
the book." Just all around you, if you watch clearly, you will find all
kinds of nuts.…</p><p>The Queen of England was visiting The Royal Military Hospital, and
insisted on making a round of the wards. She came into a room with three
beds and asked the first soldier,</p><p>"What is wrong with you?"</p><p>Embarrassed, the soldier replied, "Syphilis, Your Majesty."</p><p>Trying to appear natural, the Queen asked, "And what treatment do you
get for it?"</p><p>"Wire brush and Dettol," the soldier replied.</p><p>"Is there anything you would like to make your stay more
comfortable?" the Queen asked.</p><p>"No, Ma'am, I'm a soldier in the Queen's Own Regiment, and that's
enough for me."</p><p>Deeply touched, the Queen moved on to the next bed, where the soldier
lay on his stomach. "What is wrong with you, soldier?" she asked.</p><p>"Piles, Your Majesty," grunted the soldier. "What is your treatment
here?"</p><p>"Wire brush and Dettol, Ma'am."</p><p>Wincing the Queen asked if there was anything she could do to make
him more comfortable. He answered that he was simply grateful to be a
soldier in the Queen's Own Regiment, and that was more than enough.</p><p>The third soldier told her hoarsely that his problem was a sore
throat. "What is the treatment for that?" she asked.</p><p>"Wire brush and Dettol, Ma'am," came the reply.</p><p>"Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable?" "Yes,
Ma'am. Next time I would like my treatment first."</p><p>It is such an insane world you have just to be watchful and alert and
you will see ridiculous, hilarious things happening everywhere. It is
unbelievable that sane people should do such things.</p><p>But remember: everybody is vulnerable. We are born in a wrong
society, in a wrong world, with wrong conditions. And unless you are
really interested to get rid of your past and past impacts, impressions
on your mind, it is not going to leave you easily. The madness
continues.</p><p>And as you grow your madness also continues to grow. It is not
strange that after sixty, people start thinking you are senile; you have
been always. Just now the senility has grown to a point where it is
apparent. It cannot come suddenly from nowhere. It has been growing with
you.</p><p>Nobody wants to talk to old people for the simple reason that they
are irritable, annoyed easily, expect too much, and to you they look a
little insane. Perhaps their mind is tired; not only are they retired,
their sanity also is retired.</p><p>Three old men were sitting on a bench in a public park. One was
seventy-five, the second was eighty and the third was ninety. They used
to meet there every evening. The whole day they waited for the evening,
because they were the only friends. Everybody else was far below their
age. And there was such a generation gap that there was no question of
making friends with anybody else.</p><p>All the three persons were retired, but that evening the first
seventy-five-year-old man was looking very sad, ashamed. The second old
man asked, "What is the</p><p>matter with you? Why are you so sad, so ashamed? What have you
done?"</p><p>He said, "Don't ask. A beautiful lady was taking a bath -- she was a
guest in our house, and I was peeping from the keyhole and my mother
caught me red- handed. It is so shameful."</p><p>Both the other old men looked at each other and laughed, and they
said, "Don't be stupid, everybody does such things in childhood,
everybody gets caught. There is no need to feel so ashamed about
something that happened in childhood."</p><p>He said, "What are you saying? It happened this morning! And I don't
know how I am going to go back home. I wanted to die at that very
moment."</p><p>The second man said, "I can understand your problem. I have also my
problems. They are bigger than yours. It is now the seventh day that I
have not made love to my wife. The moment I say, `What about it?' she
simply turns to the other side and says, Ì have such a headache and I am
so tired. Just go to sleep.'"</p><p>The third old man laughed and said to the first old man, "Just ask
him what kind of love he makes to his wife."</p><p>And he asked, "What kind of love do you make?"</p><p>He said, "Love? I take her hand into my hand and press it three
times. And then we say good night and go to sleep. What more can I do at
this age?"</p><p>The oldest said, "Your problems are childish, stupid. I am facing the
real problem. This morning my wife slapped me, and I said, `Why are you
slapping me?' She said, `What are you doing?' I said, Ì'm preparing to
make love.' She said, `You idiot, neither do you sleep the whole night
nor do you let me sleep. This is the third time you are making love.' So
I think I'm losing my memory."</p><p>Just watch people.…</p><p>If you are alert and silent and sane you will be simply surprised
what goes on happening all around.</p><p>My whole effort here is to create a commune of people who are
completely free from past conditions, fanatic religions, fascist
political ideologies, and who start</p><p>responding to life out of silence and peace, awareness,
consciousness, not through a mind which has no eyes. It is blind. It
reacts immediately like any mechanism. But it has no eyes to see
directly and deeply into any problem.</p><p>Even the greatest people that you know in the world behave very
childishly, and they are creating millions of problems for other people
because they have power. The whole power is in insane hands; not a
single powerful man in the world is even interested in meditation -- and
except meditation there is no way out. We are really coming to the
crescendo of the insanity of centuries.</p><p>In all of our lifetimes we are going to see the ultimate madness
exploding by the time this century comes to an end -- and it is not
long. It is now nineteen eighty- seven; the year two thousand is less
than thirteen years away. In these thirteen years things will go on
becoming more and more insane.</p><p>Just the other day I received a letter from Oregon, from a doctor, a
dental surgeon, "I am very ashamed by the way the American government
treated you and the commune. You had brought a new colorfulness to the
state of Oregon. Rather than rejoicing in that colorfulness, they
destroyed the whole commune."</p><p>Many intelligent people in America feel the same way, but the old
problem -- those intelligent people feel but they remain silent, because
they know the majority is absolutely insane. They are so insane that
they destroyed the commune illegally, they imposed crimes on me of which
I have not even dreamt.</p><p>They blackmailed me through my attorneys, because they made my
attorneys afraid that if they were going to insist on trial, then my
life might be at risk because the American government would not like to
be defeated by a single individual: "You know and we know that we don't
have any evidence, so your victory is certain. But remember, your
victory would mean the assassination of Osho."</p><p>It was made so clear by the government attorneys to my attorneys,
that they came to me and said, "We have never seen such a thing
happening. It is absolutely insane, absolutely illegal, criminal. Now
they want you to accept any two crimes, the smallest crimes, but accept
that you are guilty of two crimes so that they can save the face of
America and American democracy and American justice. And once you have
accepted two crimes then there will be no trial and you will be
freed."</p><p>I was very stubborn. I told my attorney, "It is better to fight the
case because they don't have any evidence and they cannot have any
evidence."</p><p>But the attorney said, "The question is of blackmail. They are
threatening us that they will withdraw the bail and they will put you in
jail. And they can go on postponing the case for ten years, fifteen
years, and in these ten or fifteen years they will harass you, torture
you. And we are afraid they may even take your life, because they have
made one thing clear, that the government is not ready to be defeated by
a single individual."</p><p>With tears in their eyes they begged me, "Don't insist on a fight. We
know that you have not committed any crime, and they know it. And we had
not gone to negotiate with them; they came to us to negotiate."</p><p>This is very strange -- that the government should come to the
criminal to negotiate... for what? If I have committed the crime I
should be punished. What negotiations? Is it a business?</p><p>But the reason was clear: they knew they could not prove anything
against me. And the Attorney General of America later on accepted --
when I had left America -- that I had not committed any crime; they
didn't have any proof, any evidence, any witness. But you will not
believe that even knowing this, they blackmailed my attorneys. They
cried and I had to accept, because they told me, "It is absolutely
futile. It is hitting your head against the wall for no meaning. It will
destroy your whole movement, it will destroy all your sannyasins, and
you will leave millions of people who love you. It is better to accept
two crimes."</p><p>I said, "I am not a serious man. I can accept all of their
thirty-four crimes. There is no problem, but don't ask for any proof,
because I don't have any evidence either."</p><p>They said, "No, nobody is going to ask for evidence."</p><p>And what happened? As I accepted two crimes the judge immediately
ruled that I am punished with four hundred thousand dollars -- that is
nearabout sixty lakh rupees -- for two crimes which I have not
committed, which they have forced in a blackmail way threatening my
attorneys that my life is at risk, "just to save my life!" But they
never mentioned that once I accepted then sixty lakh rupees will be the
fine. They did not mention that. This was the second trick.</p><p>First they blackmailed, "This way there will be no trial and we will
release Osho immediately." But with the judgment the judge came -- four
hundred thousand dollars.</p><p>My people who were present in the court immediately collected that
much money within ten minutes, because the attorneys were concerned to
get me out of America as quickly as possible. And as I was coming out of
the jail, immediately another summons for some other case that they had
created in another court... They were waiting outside the jail to give
me the summons.</p><p>As I was coming to the airport I received the news that they had put
a bomb under my chair. They were waiting that if I didn't accept, and I
wanted to go with the trial, then they would just explode the bomb and
finish the whole thing, so there would be no person and no question of
any trial.</p><p>Now that bomb cannot arrive inside the jail and under my chair
without somebody who is not part of the government, who is not part of
the high authorities of the jail... The jail had no interest in killing
me. The idea must have come from Washington -- it must have come from
Ronald Reagan.</p><p>These people who are in power are lying, blackmailing -- doing every
kind of act that is inhuman. But perhaps they are doing it in their
insanity, in their unconsciousness.</p><p>And there is no great movement in the world to counter the forces of
violence, madness, except our movement for meditation.</p><p>The responsibility is great on each of you. Not only for your own
sake, but for the sake of preventing the mad powers from destroying this
beautiful planet -- this planet which has produced a Gautam Buddha, a
Jesus Christ, a Zarathustra; this planet which has given birth to a
Krishna, to a Mahavira, to a Lao Tzu. And these are just the beginnings
of spring; there are higher possibilities in the future.</p><p>If man goes on living on the earth, we will be producing even higher
peaks than we have produced in the past. Those high peaks in the past
were produced in spite of all the hindrances of the society. If the
society is supportive, we can create so many beautiful people around the
world that it can turn from a desert into an oasis.</p><p>And that's what the dental surgeon reminded me of in his letter: "We
miss you;</p><p>you turned a desert into an oasis, and we feel ashamed that the
American government did something absolutely wrong. You brought a
message which could have saved not only America but the whole of
humanity."</p><p>They are missing now because that small commune in Oregon had become
suddenly more important than Washington itself. All the eyes from all
over the world were concentrated on the commune: "What is happening
there? Why are people so happy?</p><p>Why are people so loving? Why is there no fighting? Why is there no
murder? Why is there no suicide? What has happened to those people?
Their jealousies, their conflicts seem to have disappeared, they have
entered, it seems, into a new state of consciousness."</p><p>But as far as I am concerned I have no complaint against anybody. My
own feeling is it was good that they destroyed the commune. It helped my
people to spread all over the world. And wherever my one sannyasin is,
he will create the right atmosphere. And a few people are bound to
gather around him to create small communes all over the world.</p><p>Now I'm not interested in creating a big commune, because any big
commune is going to be destroyed by the power that is any government. It
does not matter whether it is the Indian government or the American
government. If I create a big commune again, which is possible now...
The moment you have a power, although your power is of love and peace
and silence, the powerful people in New Delhi will start getting
disturbed.</p><p>I don't want to repeat history. Only idiots repeat history.</p><p>So my new idea is that we will not create a big commune that
unnecessarily comes into conflict with the powers. We will create small
communes all around the earth so nobody will be worried, because a few
people cannot be dangerous to the vested interests, but those few people
can make the whole world afire with love, with peace, with silence, with
blissfulness.</p><p>Okay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.</p><p>The Invitation Chapter #30</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

They represent two types of mind: the polar opposites. The mind which is legal can never be loving, and the mind that loves can never be legal. The legal attitude is irreligious; it is political, social; and the attitude of love is non-political, non- social, individual, personal, religious. Moses, Manu, Marx, Mao, these are the legal minds: they have given the law to the world. Jesus, Krishna, Buddha, Lao Tzu, these are the people of love. They have not given a legal commandment to the world; they have given a totally different vision.\nI have heard a story about Frederick the Great, the King of Prussia -- he was a\nvery legal mind. A woman came to him and complained about her husband. She said, \"Your Majesty, my husband treats me very mean.\"\nFrederick the Great said, \"That is not my business.\"\nBut the woman persisted. She said, \"Not only that, Your Majesty, he speaks ill of you also.\"\nFrederick the Great said, \"That is none of your business.\" This is the legal mind.\nThe legal mind is always thinking of law, never of love. The legal mind thinks of justice, but never of compassion; and a justice which is without compassion can never be just. A justice which has not compassion in it is bound to be unjust; and a compassion which may appear unjust cannot be unjust. The very nature of compassion is to be just. Justice follows compassion.as a shadow. But compassion doesn't follow justice as a shadow, because compassion is the real thing, love is the real thing. Your shadow follows you; you don't follow your shadow. The shadow cannot be followed, the shadow has to follow. And this is one of the greatest controversies of human history: whether God is love, or law; whether he is just, or compassionate.\nThe legal mind says God is law. He is just. But the legal mind cannot know what God is, because God is another name for love. The legal mind cannot reach to that dimension. The legal mind always goes on throwing responsibility on somebody else: the society, the economic structure, the history. Always the other is responsible, for the legal mind. Love takes the responsibility on itself: it is always'I' who is responsible, not you.\nI have heard a Chinese parable. In Chuang Tzu's garden there was one rose-bush which used to flower much. Then suddenly it stopped flowering. Chuang Tzu became, of course, worried -- he had always loved that rose-bush. He started showering his love on it, watching it more, taking more and more care. But nothing happened; the rose-bush remained barren unblossomed. Weeks passed, and then months passed. Then one day Chuang Tzu thought that something had gone basically wrong. It seemed the rose-bush could not be helped, and he was just going to decide not tO interfere, when the rose-bush spoke up. And the rose- bush said, \"Sir, nothing is wrong with me -- it is because of the wrong surroundings that I cannot produce flowers. Look at the soil; look at those rocks near me. They are destroying my roots. Look at the hot sun -- it is so hot,\nburning hot. How can I flower? How can you expect me to? And, I am alone here; I need other rose-bushes as companions, as competitors. Only then can I flower.\"\nChuang Tzu put a shield on the rose-bush to protect it from the sun. The beautiful rocks that he had arranged at the side were removed; the soil was changed. But nothing happened. Weeks passed; then one day Chuang Tzu said,\n\"Don't be hurt. Now let me tell you the truth. Nothing is wrong with the surroundings -- something has gone wrong in your mind. You remind me of one of my disciples who is a lawyer, who always goes on throwing responsibility onto somebody else. And, because of that, he cannot change.\"\nThe rose-bush laughed, and said: \"Sir, in fact that lawyer disciple of yours -- he has corrupted me also; I have been following him\". And from the next day the rose-bush became different, became greener, and soon flowers were coming. The rocks were replaced, the shield was removed, and the surroundings were as of old. But bigger and bigger flowers were coming.\nOnce you understand that you are responsible, you start blossoming. Law is an excuse. It is cunningness, of the mind, so that you can always protect yourself, defend yourself. It is a defence. Love is vulnerable, law is a defence arrangement.\nWhen you love somebody, you don't talk law. When you love, law disappears, because love is the ultimate law; it needs no other law. It is enough unto itself; and when love protects you, you don't need any protection. Don't be legal, otherwise you will miss all that is beautiful in life. Don't be a lawyer, be a lover; otherwise you will go on protecting yourself, and in the end you will find that there is nothing to protect -- you have been protecting just an empty ego. And you can always find ways and means to protect the empty ego.\nI have heard about one very famous artist, Oscar Wilde. His first play was dramatised. It failed completely; it was a flop. And when he came out of the theatre hall, friends asked, \"How did it go?\" He said, \"It was a great success. The audience was a great failure.\"\nThis is the legal mind, always trying to protect one's ego, the empty ego -- nothing but a soap bubble, hollow within, full of emptiness, and nothing in it.\nBut the law goes on protecting. Remember, the moment you become legal, the moment you start looking at life through the law -- maybe the law is that of the government, or the law is that of the churches, it makes no difference -- the moment you start looking at life through the law, through the morality, the code, the scripture, the commandment, you start missing it. One needs to be vulnerable to know what life is; one needs to be totally open, insecure; one needs to be able to die in knowing it -- only then one comes to know life. If you are afraid of death, you will never know life, because fear can never know. If you are unafraid of death, if you are ready to die to know, you will know life, eternal life, which never dies.Law is hidden fear, love is expressed fearlessness.\nWhen you love, fear disappears -- have you observed? When you love, there is no fear. If you love a person, fear disappears. The more you love, the more fear disappears. If you love totally, fear is absolutely absent: fear arises only when you don't love. When love does not exist, then the fear arises. Fear is absence of love; law is absence of love, because law is basically nothing but a defence of your inner trembling heart, of your inner trembling -- you are afraid; you want to protect.\nIf the society is based on law, the society will remain continuously in fear. If the society is based on love, the fear disappears and the law is not needed -- courts will not be needed; hell and heaven will not be needed. Hell is a legal attitude: all punishment is legal. The law says if you do wrong you will be punished; if you do right you will be rewarded. And then there are so-called religions -- they say if you commit sin you will be thrown into hell. Just think about their hell. These people who have created the idea of hell must have been very deeply sadistic.\nThe way they have arranged hell, they have made every arrangement possible to make you suffer.\nI have heard about a priest who was teaching, and he came to talk about hell. He warmed up to the theme, and said, \"There will be much fire, and you will be thrown into it. And there will be much trembling and gnashing of teeth.\" And an old woman stood up and she said, \"Sir, I have lost my teeth.\" The priest said,\n\"Don't be worried. False teeth will be provided.\"\nThey have made every arrangement to make you suffer -- it comes out of a\nsadist's imagination. These people who have invented hell are dangerous. And they have invented heaven also: heaven for themselves and for those who follow them, hell for those who don't follow them and don't believe in them. But these are legal attitudes: the same attitude as punishment. And punishment has failed.\nCrime cannot be stopped, it has not been stopped, by punishment. It goes on growing, because in fact the legal mind and the criminal mind are two aspects of the same coin; they are not different. All legal minds are basically criminal, and all criminal minds can become good legal minds -- they have the potentiality.\nThey are not two separate worlds; they are part of one world. Crime goes on increasing, and the law goes on becoming more and more complicated and complex.\nBy punishment man has not been changed; in fact, man has been more corrupted. Courts have not changed him; they have corrupted him more. And neither the concepts of reward, heaven, respectability, have been of any help, because hell depends on fear, and heaven depends on greed. Fear and greed, those are the problems. How can you change man through them? They are the diseases, and the legal mind goes on saying they are the medicines.\nA totally different attitude is needed: the attitude of love. Christ brings love to the world. He destroys law, the very basis of it. That was his crime; that's why he was crucified -- because he was destroying the whole basis of this criminal society; he was destroying the whole foundation rock of this criminal world, the world of wars, and violence, and aggression. He gave a totally new foundation stone. These few lines have to be understood as deeply as possible.\nTHEN ONE OF THEM, WHICH WAS A LAWYER, ASKED HIM A QUESTION, TEMPTING HIM, AND SAYING...\nTEMPTING HIM... He wanted to pull him down into a legal argument. There are many instances in Jesus' life where he had been tempted to come down from the heights of love to the dark valleys of law. And the people who tempted were very tricky. Their questions were such that, if Jesus was not really a realized one, he would have fallen a victim. They gave him what is called in logic, dilemmas -\n-\nwhatsoever you answer, you will be caught. If you say this, you will be caught; if you say the opposite, then you will also be caught.\nYou must have heard the famous story. He is sitting by the side of the river; the crowd have come, and they have brought a woman. And they say to him that this woman has committed sin: \"What do you say?\" They tempted him; because it is said in the old scripture that if a woman commits sin, she should be stoned to death. Now they are giving two alternatives to Jesus. If he says follow the scripture, then they will ask, \"Where has your concept of love, of compassion, gone? Can't you forgive her? So that talk of love is just talk.\" Then he will be caught. Or, if he says, \"Forgive her,\" then they will say, \"Then you are against the scripture; and you have been saying to people,'I have come to fulfil the scripture, not to destroy it.'\" This is dilemma; now these are the only two alternatives.\nBut the legal mind never knows that a man of love has also a third alternative, which the legal mind cannot know about, because the legal mind can only think in opposites. Only two alternatives exist: yes or no. The legal mind does not know about the third alternative, which de Bono has called po -- yes, no, and the third alternative is po: it is neither yes nor no; it is totally different.\nJesus is the first man in the world to say po. He didn't use the term; the term has been invented by de Bono. But he said po, he actually did it. He said to these people, to the crowd, that the scripture is right: one who has committed sin should be stoned to death. But...\"Only those people amongst you who have never sinned, and never thought of committing sins, you should come forward.\nYou should take stones in your hands and kill this woman.\" Now there was not a single one who had not committed sin, or who had not thought of committing it.\nThere may be people who have not committed sin, but they may be thinking continuously about it. In fact, they are bound to think about it. People who commit, think less about it: those who don't commit, continuously think and fantasise. And for the innermost core of your being, it makes no difference whether you think or you do.\nBy and by the crowd started disappearing. People who were standing in front disappeared to the back -- the legal leaders of the society, the prominent citizens of the town, started disappearing. This man had used a third alternative. He didn't say yes, he didn't say no. He said, \"Yes, kill the woman\" -- but only those who have never committed sin or thought about it, they should kill her. The crowd disappeared. Only Jesus was left with the woman. The woman fell at his\nfeet and said, \"I have really committed sin. I am a bad woman. You can punish me.\" Jesus said: \"Who am I to judge? This is between you and your Lord God.\nThis is something between you and God. Who am I to interfere? If you realize that you have done something wrong, don't do it again. God bless you.\"\nSuch situations were continuously repeated. The whole effort was to bring him into an argument where the legal mind can succeed. You cannot argue with the legal mind -- if you argue you will be defeated because in argument the legal mind is very efficient. Whatsoever position you take up, it matters not; you will be defeated. Jesus could not be defeated because he never argued. This is one of the signs, one of the indications that he had attained to love. He remained on his peak; he never descended.\nTHEN ONE OF THEM, WHICH WAS A LAWYER, ASKED HIM A QUESTION, TEMPTING HIM, AND SAYING, MASTER, WHICH IS THE GREAT\nCOMMANDMENT IN THE LAW?\nThat respect is false. He says, \"Master,\" but that respect is not true. The legal respect is never true. Whenever you pay respect as an etiquette, as a social manner, if your respect is just because you have been taught to show respect --\nyou respect your father because you have been told again and again, conditioned\n-- then that respect is false. If you pay respect to your mother because you have been told that one should pay respect to the mother, then that respect is false.\nUnless it comes out of love, it is a false coin.\nAnd love is an unconditioned feeling -- you have never been taught anything about love. Love you have brought into the world with yourself; it has just come with you; it is your nature. Only when respect comes out of love is it true; otherwise it is a deception.\nThe lawyer said: MASTER, WHICH IS THE GREAT COMMANDMENT IN THE\nLAW? Now, it is a very difficult question: which is the great commandment,\nwhich is the foremost commandment, which is the fundamental commandment in law? It is very difficult, because every law depends on other laws -- they are interlinked. You cannot find the basic law, because no law is basic. They depend on each other; they are interdependent.\nFor example, if you ask somebody what is matter, he will say, \"Not mind.\" Then ask him what is mind, and he will say, \"Not matter.\" Both are undefined, both are indefinables, but you create a fallacy of definition. Asked what is matter, you say, \"Not mind.\" The mind itself is undefined. You bring one indefinable to define something else -- which is stupid, but on the surface looks very wise -- it seems you have answered. Then you are asked what is mind, and you say, \"Not matter.\" Neither mind is known, nor matter. Two unknowns are there, but you go on fooling yourself, and fooling others. The fundamental law is not known, cannot be known. It is not only unknown, it is unknowable; and all other laws are dependent on each other: for example, whether truth is the fundamental law, or nonviolence.\nIn India it has been one of the controversies: which is basic -- non-violence or truth? If you are in a situation where you have to choose between truth or nonviolence -- if you say the truth, then there will be violence; if you don't say the truth, the violence can be avoided. What will you do? Will you say the truth, and help the violence to be committed?\nFor example, you are standing at a crossroad, and a group of policemen come.\nAnd they ask you, \"Have you seen a man pass along this road? He has to be caught and killed. He has escaped from prison. He is sentenced to death.\" You have seen the man. You can say, \"Yes,\" and be true; but then you will be responsible for the death of that man. You can say you have not seen him, or you can even give a wrong direction; then that man is saved. You remained nonviolent, but you became untrue. What will you do? It seems impossible to choose, almost impossible. Which law is the most fundamental?\nJESUS SAID UNTO HIM, THOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD THY GOD WITH\nALL THY HEART, AND WITH ALL THY SOUL, AND WITH ALL THY MIND.\nThis is po: he is not answering the question at all; he is answering something\nelse. He is not getting down to the legal world; he remains perched on his peak of love. He says,\nTHIS IS THE FIRST AND GREAT COMMANDMENT.\nLove thy God with a]l thy heart, all thy mind, and all thy soul. The question was about law, and the answer is about love. In fact, he has not answered the question; or, you can say he has answered the question because this is the only answer, there can be no other answer.\nThis has to be understood. Only from a higher plane can the question of a lower plane be answered; remaining on the same plane, the answer is impossible. For example, from where you are the question arises, many questions arise. If you ask a person who remains on the same plane as you, he cannot answer you. His answers may look relevant, but cannot be relevant, because he is also in the same situation as you.\nIt is like a madman helping another madman, the blind leading the b]ind, a confused man helping another confused man to attain to clarity. More muddledness, more confusion will happen out of it. That's what has happened in the world -- everybody is advising everybody else. Nothing is cheaper than advice; in fact, it costs nothing -- just for the asking, and everybody is ready to give you advice. Neither you think about it, nor those who are giving you advice, that they exist on the same plane, that their advice is simply useless; or, it can be even harmful. Only somebody who is on a higher plane than you can be of any help; one who has a clearer perception, a deeper clarity, a more crystallised being\n-- only he can answer your questions.\nI have heard -- it happened once: In a certain city in Tibet, wisdom was sold. A man who wanted to become wise went to the marketplace. There were many shops, and in every shop wisdom was sold. And it was plentiful; in fact so much so that it was very cheap. So he purchased thousands of wisdom bits. He came home loaded with many bullock carts. He became wise. Then he used to visit his friends to show the wisdom, because when you have it, you have to show it; otherwise what is its use? A wisdom that is borrowed or purchased can have only one function -- that of exhibition. It cannot be of any use to you; you can just use it as a decoration. But those friends had also purchased from the same market, and everybody was wise. In that town it was difficult to find a foolish man,\nbecause all fools had purchased. They discussed, they argued; every day they would meet and hurt each other by their arguments, and everybody would try to prove that 'my' view was right. And nobody was ready to listen to anybody. They created much confusion, much anger, much hostility. And they enjoyed it -- that fiery exchange of hostility -- -they became addicted to it.\nBut this man, by and by, became fed up with the whole nonsense. He started thinking, \"I was better before I purchased these wisdom bits. My mind is more burdened; I am more tense; I cannot sleep, with continuous arguments and discussions leading nowhere, moving in vicious circles.\" So he went to a wise man and asked what he should do. The wise man said, \"It is natural. When people exist on the same plane, they cannot help each other. They can only fight, and they can only try to help each other; but they will basically cause harm. You throw away all this nonsense that you call wisdom. Wisdom cannot be purchased; one has to grow into it.\" And he said one very profound thing: he said, \"If you purchase wisdom, if you learn from somebody else, if you borrow it, if it is not your own, then you will always be in trouble; because everything that you can borrow has its opposite. But if you grow in it, then it has no opposite to it.\"\nLet me explain it to you. Every law has its opposite, because law is borrowed wisdom. Love has not its opposite -- if it has, then it is not love at all. Every law has its opposite; every law can be argued against, every proof can be disproved, and there is no argument which is absolute or final.\nI used to know a very great lawyer. He founded a university in India -- he was one of the topmost men in his profession. Once it happened: he was a little absent-minded, and he was fighting a case in the Privy Council. Two Indian States were fighting. He forgot -- he had drunk too much the night before and he had a hangover. And when he went to the Privy Council, he forgot for whom he was fighting. So he started arguing for the opposite party; and he was a great lawyer, so he argued well. His assistant became very much worried -- what should he do? He pulled his coat many times, but he wouldn't listen; he was so much in the debate. When there was a break for tea, the assistant said, \"You have destroyed the whole thing. You are arguing against yourself\" But the lawyer didn't say anything. When the court started again, he said, \"Up to now, I was giving you the arguments for the opposite party. Now I will give the arguments for my party.\" And he won the case.\nEvery law has its opposite; every argument has its opposite. Every proof, if it is only logical, has its opposite. Only love has no opposite to it. The lawyer asked Jesus something; Jesus answered something else. As if the lawyer was only asking for stones, and Jesus gave him diamonds. In a way, it is irrelevant. In another way, in a deeper way, this is the only way it should be. Diamonds were not asked for -- the lawyer had no idea about those diamonds; he was only asking about some coloured stones, at the most, semi-precious. Jesus gave him diamonds -- tremendously valuable; he was asking about law, and Jesus talked about love.\nAlways remember it: whenever you come to an enlightened man, whatsoever you say is not the point. He talks out of his heart. In fact, he does not answer your questions; he answers you, your deepest need, about which you yourself are not aware.\nIt happens so many times when I am answering your questions. Many times you feel as if your question has not been answered. I know it; I am aware of it. It need not be answered. But through your question I can feel a deep urge, a deep enquiry, about which you yourself are not aware. You cannot be aware in the state you are in -- in your unconsciousness you can ask only wrong questions. In my awareness I can answer only right answers. I will repeat: in your sleep you can ask only wrong questions; in my awareness I can answer only right answers.\nOn the surface it will look absurd.\nThere are three possibilities of dialogue: one, two ignorant persons talking. Much talking goes on, but nothing happens out of it; it is just bogus. They talk, but they don't mean what they are saying, they are not even aware of what they are saying -- it is just an occupation; it feels good to be occupied. They are talking like mechanical things, two computers talking. Then there is the possibility of two enlightened persons talking. They don't talk; there is no need to talk. The communion is silent; they understand each other without the words. Two ignorant persons talking -- too many words, and no understanding. Two enlightened persons meeting -- no words, only understanding.\nThe first situation happens every day, millions of times all over the earth; the second situation happens rarely after thousands and thousands of years -- rarely does it happen that two enlightened persons meet.\nThere is a third possibility -- one enlightened person talking to an unenlightened person. Then there are two planes: one is on the earth, the other is in the sky; one is moving in a bullock cart, the other is flying in an aeroplane. The person on the earth asks one thing and the person in the sky answers something. else. But this is the only way, this is the only way the person on the earth can be helped. The lawyer had asked about the law. He had asked,\nMASTER, WHICH IS THE GREAT COMMANDMENT IN THE LAW?\nHe is not asking about love; Jesus is trying to seduce him towards love -- he has changed the whole pattern. Once it is in Jesus' hands, then he will take you into a dimension you know not, into the unknown, into the unknowable.\nJESUS SAID UNTO HIM, THOU SHALT LOVE THE LORD THY GOD WITH\nALL THY HEART, AND WITH ALL THY SOUL, AND WITH ALL THY MIND.\nWITH ALL THY HEART means with all thy feelings. That is what prayer is.\nWhen all your feelings are together, integrated into one unity, it is prayer. Prayer is your total heart, throbbing with the desire of the unknown, throbbing with a deep urge, a deep enquiry for the unknown, each beat of your heart devoted.\nWITH ALL THY MIND: that is the meaning of meditation, when all your thoughts have become one. When all your thoughts become one, thinking disappears; when all your feelings become one, feeling disappears. When your feelings are many, you are sentimental; when your feelings are one, all sentimentality disappears -- you are full of heart, but without any sentimentality.\nPrayer is not sentimentalism. Prayer is such a harmony of feelings, such a total unity of feelings that the quality of the feelings immediately changes. Just as you put water on to heat, it goes on becoming warmer, warmer, hot, more hot -- up to 99o it is still water. Then the 100o comes, and suddenly there is a transformation.\nThe water is no more water, it starts evaporating; and the quality immediately changes. The water has a quality to flow downwards: when it evaporates, the vapour has a quality to float upwards. The dimension has changed.\nWhen you live in feelings, so many feelings, you are just a confusion, a madhouse. When all the feelings are integrated, there comes a moment of transformation. When they all become one, you are at the 100o point, the evaporating point. Immediately the nature of the feelings disappears. The old down-flowing is no more there; you start evaporating like vapour towards the sky. That is what prayer is.\nAnd the same thing happens when all your thoughts are one -- thinking stops.\nWhen thoughts are many, thinking is possible; when thoughts are one, then there comes a moment that this oneness of thought becomes almost synonymous with no-thought. To have one thought is to have no thought, because the one cannot exist a]one. The one can exist only with the many, the one can exist only in a crowd. When the crowd has disappeared, the one also disappears, and there comes a state of no-thought.\nSo Jesus, in his small sentence, has condensed the whole of religion.\nTHOU SHALT LOVE THE LORD THY GOD WITH ALL THY HEART: this\nis what prayer is all about.\nWITH ALL THY MIND: that is what meditation is all about.\nAND WITH ALL THY SOUL: the soul is the transcendence of thinking and feeling. The soul is beyond prayer and beyond meditation. The soul is your nature -- it is the transcendental consciousness in you. Look at yourself as a triangle -- on the lower base, feeling, thinking. But feeling and thinking are the only two that you have been feeling up to now; you don't know the third. The third can be known only when the feeling becomes prayer, and starts moving upwards, and thinking becomes meditation, and starts moving upwards. Then prayer and meditation meet at a point -- that point is soul. Somewhere your heart and your mind meet: that is you, that is a beyondness. That's what Jesus calls the soul.\nTHIS IS THE FIRST AND GREAT COMMANDMENT.\nNow he is using the language of the lawyer. He has said whatsoever he wanted to say; now he comes to the language of the lawyer. The first sentence belongs to Jesus' plane; the second sentence belongs to the lawyer's plane. And he has tried to create a bridge between the two.\nTHIS IS THE FIRST AND THE GREAT COMMANDMENT: love is the first\nand the great commandment. In fact, love is not a commandment at all, because you cannot be commanded to love; you cannot be ordered to love, you cannot be forced to love, you cannot manage and control love. Love is bigger than you, higher than you -- how can you control it? And if you are commanded to love, if somebody comes just as they do in the army: \"Right turn! Left turn!\" -- and somebody comes and says, \"Love!\" what can you do ~'Right turn' is okay.'Left turn' is okay. But'Love turn'? -- you don't know where to turn, where to go; you don't know that way -- it cannot be commanded.\nYes, you can pretend; you can act. That's what has happened on this earth. The greatest curse that has happened on this earth is that love has been forced. From the very childhood everybody is taught to love, as if love can be taught.'Love your mother','Love your father','Love your brothers','Love your sisters', love this, love that: and the child starts trying -- because how can the child know that love cannot be an act? It is a happening.\nJust the other night I was saying... once it happened: A musician was playing on his organ -- just sitting idle, with nothing to do; in a playful mood, not serious at all -- in fun. Suddenly something happened for which he had been waiting his whole life. He struck a chord. For that chord he had been waiting, and waiting, and waiting. He had tried his utmost and he had never been able to manage it; and suddenly it was there... and he had just been fingering the keys. He was thrilled, ecstatic. He danced. And then he tried again. But he could not get it again. He tried hard -- the harder he tried, the more frustrated he was. For months he became almost mad. He tried and tried, day and night; and the more he tried, the further away it looked. In fact, after a few weeks he started to wonder if it had ever happened, or if he had imagined it. The memory of it had also gone so far away that he started thinking, \"Maybe I simply dreamt about it, and it has not happened.\" Then he dropped the whole subject. Then he forgot about it.\nAgain one day after a few months, he was just sitting at the organ, fingering the keys. Again it was there; again it happened. He was thrilled; he was ecstatic. But now he understood -- it happened only when he was not there. Then he never tried; then he never tried to bring it back. It started to happen almost every day.\nIt started to happen, by and by, whenever he touched the keys. It became a natural flow.\nLove is just like that. You cannot force it. You have been missing because you have been trying too hard. The more I look and observe you, the more I feel your desert-like state. Everybody is in search of love. You may call it God, you may call it something else; but deep down I know you are in search of love. But you have become incapable, not because you have not tried, but because you have tried too hard.\nLove is a happening; it cannot be commanded. Because you have been commanded to love, your love has been falsified from the very beginning, poisoned from the very source. Never say to a child -- never commit this sin --\nnever say to a child, \"Love your mother.\" Love the child, and let love happen.\nDon't say, \"Love. Love me, because I am your mother, or I am your father. Love me.\" Don't make it a commandment; otherwise your child will miss for ever and ever. Just love him. In a loving milieu, one day suddenly the chord just happens, the harmony is found in the innermost organ of your being. Something starts; some melody, some harmony arises, and then you know that it is your nature.\nBut then you never try to do it; then you simply relax and allow it to be.\nTHIS IS THE FIRST AND GREAT COMMANDMENT. Jesus is using the\nlanguage of the lawyer, because he is answering him; otherwise love is not a commandment, and cannot be a commandment.\nAND THE SECOND IS LIKE UNTO IT, THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF:\nThe first is, love thy God. God means the total, the tao, the brahma. God is not a very good word; tao is far better -the total, the whole, the existence -- love existence. That is the first, the most fundamental.\nAND THE SECOND IS LIKE UNTO IT, THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF;\n... because it is difficult to find God, and it is difficult to love God, if you have not found him already. How can you love God, who is unknown? How can you love the unknown? You need some bridge, you need some familiarity. How can\nyou love God? It looks absurd; it is absurd.Hence the second commandment. AND THE SECOND IS LIKE UNTO IT, THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF:\nI was reading a story -- I liked it. A learned man asked Rabbi Abraham, \"They say that you give people mysterious drugs, and that your drugs are effective.\nGive me one, that I may attain to the fear of God.\"\n\"I don't know any drug for the fear of God,\" said the Rabbi. \"But, if you like, I can give you one for the love of God.\"\n'That is even better!\" cried the scholar. \"Just you give it to me. \"It is the love of one's fellow men,\" answered the Rabbi.\nIf you real]y want to love God, you have to start by loving your fellow men, because that is the nearest God is to you. And by and by, ripples of your love can go on expanding. Love is like a pebble thrown into a silent lake: ripples arise, and then they start spreading tO the faraway shores. But -- first the touch of the pebble on the lake; close to the pebble they arise, and then far and far away they spread.\nFirst, you will have to love those who are like you -- because you know them, because at least you can feel a certain familiarity, a certain at-homeness with them. Then the love can go on expanding. Then you can love animals, then you can love trees, then you can love rocks. And then only can you love existence as such, not before then.\nSo, if you can love human beings, you have taken the first step. But just the opposite has been happening on this unfortunate earth -- people love God, and kill human beings. In fact, they say because they love God so much, they have to kill. Christians kill Mohammedans, Mohammedans kill Christians, Hindus kill Mohammedans, Mohammedans kill Hindus, because they all love God -- in the name of God, they kill human beings.\nTheir gods are false. Because if your God is true, if you have really known what God means, if you have realised even a bit, if you have even attained to just a\nglimpse of what God is, you will love human beings; you will love animals, you will love trees, you will love rocks -- you will Love. Love will become your natural state of being. And if you cannot love human beings, don't be deceived --\nthen no temple is going to help you.\nJust two or three days before, one beautiful woman, a rare person, came to see me. Her whole life she has been a humanist, not believing in God, a no-sayer. She told me, \"I am surprised that I am here.\" Her surprise is natural. She had never been to any temple, to any church, to the so-called religious people; and then she has come here. And not only that she wanted to be initiated into sannyas. She could not believe herself -- what was happening. But I could look into her. She has been able to come to me because she has loved human beings. She has taken the first step towards the temple. She may not have gone to any temple -- that is not needed. She may not have ever thought about God -- that is not needed. But she has taken an authentic step; she has loved human beings. She has been a no-sayer, but that is the basis for saying yes. She has earned her sannyas.\nThere are two types of people who come to me and want to be initiated: a few who have not earned it -- she has earned it. Some will start earning it only after they have taken sannyas -- for them it is a beginning. But for that old woman it is not a beginning, it is a culmination. She has arrived. Her whole life has been a preparation for it. She said no. To say yes to human beings she denied God: perfectly good -- as it should be. Say no to God, but never say no to human beings, because if you say no to human beings, the path is cut; then you will never be able to reach God. Say no to the church, to the temple; there is no problem about it. But never say no to love, because that is the real temple. All other temples are just false coins, pseudo-images, not authentic. There is only one authentic temple, and that temple is love. Never say no to love -- you will find God; God cannot hide for long.\nThe second commandment, Jesus says,\nTHOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF.\n... because, in fact, all humanity is you, in many faces and in many forms. Can't you see it -- that your neighbour is nobody else than you, your own being in a different shape and form\nMany rivers in the world are named after colours. In China we have the Yellow River; somewhere in South Africa they have the Red River; in the U.S., I have heard, they have the White River, the Green River, the Purple River. In Spain they have a river, the Rio Tinto -- it has three names. Somewhere it is known as the Green River, somewhere as the Red River, somewhere as the White River.\nThe river itself has no colour; water is colourless, but the river takes the colour of the terrain it passes through, the colour of the shrubbery on the banks. If it passes a desert, of course it has a different colour; if it passes through a forest, the forest is reflected -- the shrubbery, the greenery -- it has a different colour. If it passes through a terrain where the mud is yellow, it becomes yellow. But no river has any colour. And every river, whether it is called white, or green, or yellow, reaches naturally to its end, to its destiny, falls into the ocean, and becomes oceanic.\nYour differences are because of your terrain. Your colours are different because of your terrain. But your innermost quality of being is colourless; it is the same.\nSomebody is black, a negro; somebody is white, an Englishman;somebody is just in them middle, an Indian; somebody is yellow, a Chinese -- so many colours.\nBut remember, these are the colours of the terrain of the body you pass through. They are not your colours; you are colourless.\nIn India, we have a name for the sannyasin -- we call him VIRAGI. That means colourless. RAG means colour; VIRAG means colourlessness; and VIRAGI is one who has come to know his colourless being.\nYou are not the body; neither are you the mind, nor are you the heart. Your mind differs, because it has been conditioned differently; your body is different, because it has come through a different terrain, through a different heredity; but you are not different.\nJesus says: THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF. As you\nlove yourself, love your neighbour. And one thing very basic, which Christians have completely forgotten Jesus says, \"Love thyself,\" and, \"Love thy neighbour as thyself\"\nUnless you love yourself, you cannot love your neighbour.All the so-called Christianity has been teaching you hatred towards yourself, condemnation towards yourself. Love yourself, because you are the nearest to God. It is there that the first ripple has to arise. Love yourself. Self-love is the most fundamental thing -- if you ever want to be religious, self-love is the basis. And all so-called religions go on teaching you self-hatred: \"Condemn yourself, you are a sinner, guilty -- this and that -- you are worthless.\"\nYou are not a sinner. They have made you so. You are not guilty. They have given you wrong interpretations of life. Accept yourself, and love yourself. Only then can you love your neighbour, otherwise there is no possibility. If you don't love yourself, how can you love another being.? I teach you self-love. At least do that; if you cannot do anything else -- love yourself. And out of your self- love, by and by you will see love is starting to flow; it is expanding; it is reaching to the neighbours.\nThe whole problem today is that you hate yourself and you want to love somebody else, which is impossible. And the other also hates himself, and he wants to love you. That lesson has to be learned first within yourself.\nIf you ask Freud and the psychoanalysts, they have come to discover a very basic thing. They say -- first, the child is autoerotic, masturbatory; the child loves himself. Then the child becomes homosexual -- the boys love boys and want to play with boys; girls want to play with girls, and they don't want to mix with each other. And then arises heterosexuality -- the boy wants to mix, and love a girl; a girl wants to meet a boy and love. First, auto-erotic, then homo- erotic, then hetero-erotic -- this is about sex. The same is true about love.\nFirst, you love yourself Then you love your neighbour, other human beings. And then you move beyond: you love existence. But the basis is you. So don't condemn yourself; don't reject yourself. Accept. God has taken abode in you. He has loved you so much, that's why he has taken abode in you. He has made a temple of you; he lives in you. If you reject yourself, you reject the nearest to God that you can find. If you reject the nearest, it is impossible that you will love the faraway.\nWhen Jesus says: THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF, he\nis saying two things: first, love thyself, so that you can be capable of loving thy neighbour.\nON THESE TWO COMMANDMENTS HANG ALL THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS.\nIn fact it is one commandment, Love. Love is the one and only order of things. If you have understood love, you have understood all. If you have not understood love, you may know many things, but all that knowledge is simply rot. Throw it on a rubbish heap and forget all about it. Start from the very beginning. Be a child again, and start loving yourself again.\nYour lake, as I see it, has no ripples. The first pebble of love has not fallen in it.\nI have heard a Danish story. Remember it -- let it become part of your mindfulness. The story tells about a spider who lived high up in the rafters of an old barn. One day he let himself down by a long thread to a lower beam, where he found the flies were more plentiful and more easily caught. He therefore decided to live permanently at this lower level, and spun himself a comfortable web there. But one day he happened to notice the line down which he had come, stretching away into the darkness above. \"I don't need this any more,\" he said. \"It only gets in the way.\" He snapped it, and with it destroyed his whole web, which needed it for support.\nThis is the story of man also. A thread joins you with the ultimate, the highest; call it God. You may have completely forgotten that you have descended from there. You come from God, and you have to go back to him. Everything goes back to the original source; it has to be so. Then the circle is complete, and one is fulfilled. And you may even feel like this spider, that the thread that joins you to the highest comes in the way. Many times because of it you cannot do many things: again and again it comes in the way. You cannot be violent as you would like to be; you cannot be aggressive as you would like to be; you cannot hate as much as you would like to hate -- the line comes again and again in the way.\nAnd sometimes you may feel like this spider: to cut it, to snap at it, so that your path is clear.\nThat's what Nietzsche says: \"God is dead.\" He snapped at it. But immediately Nietzsche became mad. The moment he said, \"God is dead,\" he became mad, because then you are cut away from the original source of all life. Then you are starved of something very vital, essential. Then you miss something, for you had become completely oblivious that it was the very base. The spider snapped at the\nthread, and with it destroyed his whole web, which needed it for support.\nWherever you are, in your darkest night, a ray of light is still joined with you from God, from existence. That is your life; that's how you are alive. Find out that thread, because that is going to be the way back home.\nOn 5th June, 1910, O'Henry was dying. It was getting dark. Friends were surrounding him. Suddenly he opened his eyes and said, \"Put the light up. I don't want to go home in darkness.\" The light was put up; he closed his eyes, smiled, and disappeared.\nThe thread that is joining you, the single ray of life that is making you alive, is the way back home. Howsoever far you have gone, you are still joined with God\n-- otherwise it would not be possible. You may have forgotten him, but he has not forgotten you; and that is the real thing that matters.\nTry to find out something in you which joins you to existence. Search for it, and you will come to the commandment Jesus is talking about. If you search, you will come to know it is love, not knowledge, that joins you to existence; not riches, not power, not fame -- it is love that joins you to existence. And whenever you feel love, you are tremendously happy, because more and more life becomes available to you.\nJesus, or a Buddha, both are like a honey-bee. The honey-bee goes and finds beautiful flowers in a valley. She comes back, she dances a dance of ecstasy near her friends to tell them that she has found a beautiful valley full of flowers.\nCome, follow me. A Jesus is just a honey-bee who has found the original source of life: a valley of beautiful flowers, flowers of eternity. He comes and dances near you to give you the message: Come, follow me.\nIf you try to understand and seek within you, you will find it is love that is the most significant, most essential thing in your being. Don't starve it. Help it to grow, so that it can become a big tree; so that birds of heaven can take shelter in you; so that in your love, tired travellers on the path can rest; so that you can share your love; so that you can also become a honey-bee. In your ecstasy, you can also tell people to come and follow you. Each and everyone has to become a Jesus one day, and don't be contented for less. Unless you become a Jesus, you cannot be a Christian. If you are satisfied by being a Christian, you are fooling\nyourself. Be a Jesus -- less than that is not worthwhile. And you can be, because in fact you are. Only a recognition... just a recognition.\nCome Follow To You, Vol 3 \u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"8703","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/come_follow_to_you__vol_3/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/come_follow_to_you__vol_3/>Come Follow To You - Vol 3</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter #7</h1><div class=post-meta>41 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8703 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Come_Follow_To_You__Vol_3/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

title: The more you love, the more fear disappears. 17 December 1975 am
in Buddha Hall</h3><p>MATTHEW 22</p><p>35 THEN ONE OF THEM, WHICH WAS A LAWYER, ASKED HIM A QUESTION,
TEMPTING HIM, AND SAYING,</p><p>36 MASTER, WHICH IS THE GREAT COMMANDMENT IN THE LAW</p><p>37 JESUS SAID UNTO HIM, THOU SHALT LOVE THE LORD THY GOD WITH</p><p>ALL THY HEART, AND WITH ALL THY SOUL, AND WITH ALL THY MIND.</p><p>38 THIS IS THE FIRST AND GREAT COMMANDMENT.</p><p>39 AND THE SECOND IS LIKE UNTO IT, THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS
THYSELF.</p><p>40 ON THESE TWO COMMANDMENTS HANG ALL THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS.</p><p>THESE TWO WORDS, law and love, are tremendously significant. They
represent two types of mind: the polar opposites. The mind which is
legal can never be loving, and the mind that loves can never be legal.
The legal attitude is irreligious; it is political, social; and the
attitude of love is non-political, non- social, individual, personal,
religious. Moses, Manu, Marx, Mao, these are the legal minds: they have
given the law to the world. Jesus, Krishna, Buddha, Lao Tzu, these are
the people of love. They have not given a legal commandment to the
world; they have given a totally different vision.</p><p>I have heard a story about Frederick the Great, the King of Prussia
-- he was a</p><p>very legal mind. A woman came to him and complained about her
husband. She said, "Your Majesty, my husband treats me very mean."</p><p>Frederick the Great said, "That is not my business."</p><p>But the woman persisted. She said, "Not only that, Your Majesty, he
speaks ill of you also."</p><p>Frederick the Great said, "That is none of your business." This is
the legal mind.</p><p>The legal mind is always thinking of law, never of love. The legal
mind thinks of justice, but never of compassion; and a justice which is
without compassion can never be just. A justice which has not compassion
in it is bound to be unjust; and a compassion which may appear unjust
cannot be unjust. The very nature of compassion is to be just. Justice
follows compassion.as a shadow. But compassion doesn't follow justice as
a shadow, because compassion is the real thing, love is the real thing.
Your shadow follows you; you don't follow your shadow. The shadow cannot
be followed, the shadow has to follow. And this is one of the greatest
controversies of human history: whether God is love, or law; whether he
is just, or compassionate.</p><p>The legal mind says God is law. He is just. But the legal mind cannot
know what God is, because God is another name for love. The legal mind
cannot reach to that dimension. The legal mind always goes on throwing
responsibility on somebody else: the society, the economic structure,
the history. Always the other is responsible, for the legal mind. Love
takes the responsibility on itself: it is always'I' who is responsible,
not you.</p><p>I have heard a Chinese parable. In Chuang Tzu's garden there was one
rose-bush which used to flower much. Then suddenly it stopped flowering.
Chuang Tzu became, of course, worried -- he had always loved that
rose-bush. He started showering his love on it, watching it more, taking
more and more care. But nothing happened; the rose-bush remained barren
unblossomed. Weeks passed, and then months passed. Then one day Chuang
Tzu thought that something had gone basically wrong. It seemed the
rose-bush could not be helped, and he was just going to decide not tO
interfere, when the rose-bush spoke up. And the rose- bush said, "Sir,
nothing is wrong with me -- it is because of the wrong surroundings that
I cannot produce flowers. Look at the soil; look at those rocks near me.
They are destroying my roots. Look at the hot sun -- it is so hot,</p><p>burning hot. How can I flower? How can you expect me to? And, I am
alone here; I need other rose-bushes as companions, as competitors. Only
then can I flower."</p><p>Chuang Tzu put a shield on the rose-bush to protect it from the sun.
The beautiful rocks that he had arranged at the side were removed; the
soil was changed. But nothing happened. Weeks passed; then one day
Chuang Tzu said,</p><p>"Don't be hurt. Now let me tell you the truth. Nothing is wrong with
the surroundings -- something has gone wrong in your mind. You remind me
of one of my disciples who is a lawyer, who always goes on throwing
responsibility onto somebody else. And, because of that, he cannot
change."</p><p>The rose-bush laughed, and said: "Sir, in fact that lawyer disciple
of yours -- he has corrupted me also; I have been following him". And
from the next day the rose-bush became different, became greener, and
soon flowers were coming. The rocks were replaced, the shield was
removed, and the surroundings were as of old. But bigger and bigger
flowers were coming.</p><p>Once you understand that you are responsible, you start blossoming.
Law is an excuse. It is cunningness, of the mind, so that you can always
protect yourself, defend yourself. It is a defence. Love is vulnerable,
law is a defence arrangement.</p><p>When you love somebody, you don't talk law. When you love, law
disappears, because love is the ultimate law; it needs no other law. It
is enough unto itself; and when love protects you, you don't need any
protection. Don't be legal, otherwise you will miss all that is
beautiful in life. Don't be a lawyer, be a lover; otherwise you will go
on protecting yourself, and in the end you will find that there is
nothing to protect -- you have been protecting just an empty ego. And
you can always find ways and means to protect the empty ego.</p><p>I have heard about one very famous artist, Oscar Wilde. His first
play was dramatised. It failed completely; it was a flop. And when he
came out of the theatre hall, friends asked, "How did it go?" He said,
"It was a great success. The audience was a great failure."</p><p>This is the legal mind, always trying to protect one's ego, the empty
ego -- nothing but a soap bubble, hollow within, full of emptiness, and
nothing in it.</p><p>But the law goes on protecting. Remember, the moment you become
legal, the moment you start looking at life through the law -- maybe the
law is that of the government, or the law is that of the churches, it
makes no difference -- the moment you start looking at life through the
law, through the morality, the code, the scripture, the commandment, you
start missing it. One needs to be vulnerable to know what life is; one
needs to be totally open, insecure; one needs to be able to die in
knowing it -- only then one comes to know life. If you are afraid of
death, you will never know life, because fear can never know. If you are
unafraid of death, if you are ready to die to know, you will know life,
eternal life, which never dies.Law is hidden fear, love is expressed
fearlessness.</p><p>When you love, fear disappears -- have you observed? When you love,
there is no fear. If you love a person, fear disappears. The more you
love, the more fear disappears. If you love totally, fear is absolutely
absent: fear arises only when you don't love. When love does not exist,
then the fear arises. Fear is absence of love; law is absence of love,
because law is basically nothing but a defence of your inner trembling
heart, of your inner trembling -- you are afraid; you want to
protect.</p><p>If the society is based on law, the society will remain continuously
in fear. If the society is based on love, the fear disappears and the
law is not needed -- courts will not be needed; hell and heaven will not
be needed. Hell is a legal attitude: all punishment is legal. The law
says if you do wrong you will be punished; if you do right you will be
rewarded. And then there are so-called religions -- they say if you
commit sin you will be thrown into hell. Just think about their hell.
These people who have created the idea of hell must have been very
deeply sadistic.</p><p>The way they have arranged hell, they have made every arrangement
possible to make you suffer.</p><p>I have heard about a priest who was teaching, and he came to talk
about hell. He warmed up to the theme, and said, "There will be much
fire, and you will be thrown into it. And there will be much trembling
and gnashing of teeth." And an old woman stood up and she said, "Sir, I
have lost my teeth." The priest said,</p><p>"Don't be worried. False teeth will be provided."</p><p>They have made every arrangement to make you suffer -- it comes out
of a</p><p>sadist's imagination. These people who have invented hell are
dangerous. And they have invented heaven also: heaven for themselves and
for those who follow them, hell for those who don't follow them and
don't believe in them. But these are legal attitudes: the same attitude
as punishment. And punishment has failed.</p><p>Crime cannot be stopped, it has not been stopped, by punishment. It
goes on growing, because in fact the legal mind and the criminal mind
are two aspects of the same coin; they are not different. All legal
minds are basically criminal, and all criminal minds can become good
legal minds -- they have the potentiality.</p><p>They are not two separate worlds; they are part of one world. Crime
goes on increasing, and the law goes on becoming more and more
complicated and complex.</p><p>By punishment man has not been changed; in fact, man has been more
corrupted. Courts have not changed him; they have corrupted him more.
And neither the concepts of reward, heaven, respectability, have been of
any help, because hell depends on fear, and heaven depends on greed.
Fear and greed, those are the problems. How can you change man through
them? They are the diseases, and the legal mind goes on saying they are
the medicines.</p><p>A totally different attitude is needed: the attitude of love. Christ
brings love to the world. He destroys law, the very basis of it. That
was his crime; that's why he was crucified -- because he was destroying
the whole basis of this criminal society; he was destroying the whole
foundation rock of this criminal world, the world of wars, and violence,
and aggression. He gave a totally new foundation stone. These few lines
have to be understood as deeply as possible.</p><p>THEN ONE OF THEM, WHICH WAS A LAWYER, ASKED HIM A QUESTION, TEMPTING
HIM, AND SAYING...</p><p>TEMPTING HIM... He wanted to pull him down into a legal argument.
There are many instances in Jesus' life where he had been tempted to
come down from the heights of love to the dark valleys of law. And the
people who tempted were very tricky. Their questions were such that, if
Jesus was not really a realized one, he would have fallen a victim. They
gave him what is called in logic, dilemmas -</p><p>-</p><p>whatsoever you answer, you will be caught. If you say this, you will
be caught; if you say the opposite, then you will also be caught.</p><p>You must have heard the famous story. He is sitting by the side of
the river; the crowd have come, and they have brought a woman. And they
say to him that this woman has committed sin: "What do you say?" They
tempted him; because it is said in the old scripture that if a woman
commits sin, she should be stoned to death. Now they are giving two
alternatives to Jesus. If he says follow the scripture, then they will
ask, "Where has your concept of love, of compassion, gone? Can't you
forgive her? So that talk of love is just talk." Then he will be caught.
Or, if he says, "Forgive her," then they will say, "Then you are against
the scripture; and you have been saying to people,'I have come to fulfil
the scripture, not to destroy it.'" This is dilemma; now these are the
only two alternatives.</p><p>But the legal mind never knows that a man of love has also a third
alternative, which the legal mind cannot know about, because the legal
mind can only think in opposites. Only two alternatives exist: yes or
no. The legal mind does not know about the third alternative, which de
Bono has called po -- yes, no, and the third alternative is po: it is
neither yes nor no; it is totally different.</p><p>Jesus is the first man in the world to say po. He didn't use the
term; the term has been invented by de Bono. But he said po, he actually
did it. He said to these people, to the crowd, that the scripture is
right: one who has committed sin should be stoned to death. But..."Only
those people amongst you who have never sinned, and never thought of
committing sins, you should come forward.</p><p>You should take stones in your hands and kill this woman." Now there
was not a single one who had not committed sin, or who had not thought
of committing it.</p><p>There may be people who have not committed sin, but they may be
thinking continuously about it. In fact, they are bound to think about
it. People who commit, think less about it: those who don't commit,
continuously think and fantasise. And for the innermost core of your
being, it makes no difference whether you think or you do.</p><p>By and by the crowd started disappearing. People who were standing in
front disappeared to the back -- the legal leaders of the society, the
prominent citizens of the town, started disappearing. This man had used
a third alternative. He didn't say yes, he didn't say no. He said, "Yes,
kill the woman" -- but only those who have never committed sin or
thought about it, they should kill her. The crowd disappeared. Only
Jesus was left with the woman. The woman fell at his</p><p>feet and said, "I have really committed sin. I am a bad woman. You
can punish me." Jesus said: "Who am I to judge? This is between you and
your Lord God.</p><p>This is something between you and God. Who am I to interfere? If you
realize that you have done something wrong, don't do it again. God bless
you."</p><p>Such situations were continuously repeated. The whole effort was to
bring him into an argument where the legal mind can succeed. You cannot
argue with the legal mind -- if you argue you will be defeated because
in argument the legal mind is very efficient. Whatsoever position you
take up, it matters not; you will be defeated. Jesus could not be
defeated because he never argued. This is one of the signs, one of the
indications that he had attained to love. He remained on his peak; he
never descended.</p><p>THEN ONE OF THEM, WHICH WAS A LAWYER, ASKED HIM A QUESTION, TEMPTING
HIM, AND SAYING, MASTER, WHICH IS THE GREAT</p><p>COMMANDMENT IN THE LAW?</p><p>That respect is false. He says, "Master," but that respect is not
true. The legal respect is never true. Whenever you pay respect as an
etiquette, as a social manner, if your respect is just because you have
been taught to show respect --</p><p>you respect your father because you have been told again and again,
conditioned</p><p>-- then that respect is false. If you pay respect to your mother
because you have been told that one should pay respect to the mother,
then that respect is false.</p><p>Unless it comes out of love, it is a false coin.</p><p>And love is an unconditioned feeling -- you have never been taught
anything about love. Love you have brought into the world with yourself;
it has just come with you; it is your nature. Only when respect comes
out of love is it true; otherwise it is a deception.</p><p>The lawyer said: MASTER, WHICH IS THE GREAT COMMANDMENT IN THE</p><p>LAW? Now, it is a very difficult question: which is the great
commandment,</p><p>which is the foremost commandment, which is the fundamental
commandment in law? It is very difficult, because every law depends on
other laws -- they are interlinked. You cannot find the basic law,
because no law is basic. They depend on each other; they are
interdependent.</p><p>For example, if you ask somebody what is matter, he will say, "Not
mind." Then ask him what is mind, and he will say, "Not matter." Both
are undefined, both are indefinables, but you create a fallacy of
definition. Asked what is matter, you say, "Not mind." The mind itself
is undefined. You bring one indefinable to define something else --
which is stupid, but on the surface looks very wise -- it seems you have
answered. Then you are asked what is mind, and you say, "Not matter."
Neither mind is known, nor matter. Two unknowns are there, but you go on
fooling yourself, and fooling others. The fundamental law is not known,
cannot be known. It is not only unknown, it is unknowable; and all other
laws are dependent on each other: for example, whether truth is the
fundamental law, or nonviolence.</p><p>In India it has been one of the controversies: which is basic --
non-violence or truth? If you are in a situation where you have to
choose between truth or nonviolence -- if you say the truth, then there
will be violence; if you don't say the truth, the violence can be
avoided. What will you do? Will you say the truth, and help the violence
to be committed?</p><p>For example, you are standing at a crossroad, and a group of
policemen come.</p><p>And they ask you, "Have you seen a man pass along this road? He has
to be caught and killed. He has escaped from prison. He is sentenced to
death." You have seen the man. You can say, "Yes," and be true; but then
you will be responsible for the death of that man. You can say you have
not seen him, or you can even give a wrong direction; then that man is
saved. You remained nonviolent, but you became untrue. What will you do?
It seems impossible to choose, almost impossible. Which law is the most
fundamental?</p><p>JESUS SAID UNTO HIM, THOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD THY GOD WITH</p><p>ALL THY HEART, AND WITH ALL THY SOUL, AND WITH ALL THY MIND.</p><p>This is po: he is not answering the question at all; he is answering
something</p><p>else. He is not getting down to the legal world; he remains perched
on his peak of love. He says,</p><p>THIS IS THE FIRST AND GREAT COMMANDMENT.</p><p>Love thy God with a]l thy heart, all thy mind, and all thy soul. The
question was about law, and the answer is about love. In fact, he has
not answered the question; or, you can say he has answered the question
because this is the only answer, there can be no other answer.</p><p>This has to be understood. Only from a higher plane can the question
of a lower plane be answered; remaining on the same plane, the answer is
impossible. For example, from where you are the question arises, many
questions arise. If you ask a person who remains on the same plane as
you, he cannot answer you. His answers may look relevant, but cannot be
relevant, because he is also in the same situation as you.</p><p>It is like a madman helping another madman, the blind leading the
b]ind, a confused man helping another confused man to attain to clarity.
More muddledness, more confusion will happen out of it. That's what has
happened in the world -- everybody is advising everybody else. Nothing
is cheaper than advice; in fact, it costs nothing -- just for the
asking, and everybody is ready to give you advice. Neither you think
about it, nor those who are giving you advice, that they exist on the
same plane, that their advice is simply useless; or, it can be even
harmful. Only somebody who is on a higher plane than you can be of any
help; one who has a clearer perception, a deeper clarity, a more
crystallised being</p><p>-- only he can answer your questions.</p><p>I have heard -- it happened once: In a certain city in Tibet, wisdom
was sold. A man who wanted to become wise went to the marketplace. There
were many shops, and in every shop wisdom was sold. And it was
plentiful; in fact so much so that it was very cheap. So he purchased
thousands of wisdom bits. He came home loaded with many bullock carts.
He became wise. Then he used to visit his friends to show the wisdom,
because when you have it, you have to show it; otherwise what is its
use? A wisdom that is borrowed or purchased can have only one function
-- that of exhibition. It cannot be of any use to you; you can just use
it as a decoration. But those friends had also purchased from the same
market, and everybody was wise. In that town it was difficult to find a
foolish man,</p><p>because all fools had purchased. They discussed, they argued; every
day they would meet and hurt each other by their arguments, and
everybody would try to prove that 'my' view was right. And nobody was
ready to listen to anybody. They created much confusion, much anger,
much hostility. And they enjoyed it -- that fiery exchange of hostility
-- -they became addicted to it.</p><p>But this man, by and by, became fed up with the whole nonsense. He
started thinking, "I was better before I purchased these wisdom bits. My
mind is more burdened; I am more tense; I cannot sleep, with continuous
arguments and discussions leading nowhere, moving in vicious circles."
So he went to a wise man and asked what he should do. The wise man said,
"It is natural. When people exist on the same plane, they cannot help
each other. They can only fight, and they can only try to help each
other; but they will basically cause harm. You throw away all this
nonsense that you call wisdom. Wisdom cannot be purchased; one has to
grow into it." And he said one very profound thing: he said, "If you
purchase wisdom, if you learn from somebody else, if you borrow it, if
it is not your own, then you will always be in trouble; because
everything that you can borrow has its opposite. But if you grow in it,
then it has no opposite to it."</p><p>Let me explain it to you. Every law has its opposite, because law is
borrowed wisdom. Love has not its opposite -- if it has, then it is not
love at all. Every law has its opposite; every law can be argued
against, every proof can be disproved, and there is no argument which is
absolute or final.</p><p>I used to know a very great lawyer. He founded a university in India
-- he was one of the topmost men in his profession. Once it happened: he
was a little absent-minded, and he was fighting a case in the Privy
Council. Two Indian States were fighting. He forgot -- he had drunk too
much the night before and he had a hangover. And when he went to the
Privy Council, he forgot for whom he was fighting. So he started arguing
for the opposite party; and he was a great lawyer, so he argued well.
His assistant became very much worried -- what should he do? He pulled
his coat many times, but he wouldn't listen; he was so much in the
debate. When there was a break for tea, the assistant said, "You have
destroyed the whole thing. You are arguing against yourself" But the
lawyer didn't say anything. When the court started again, he said, "Up
to now, I was giving you the arguments for the opposite party. Now I
will give the arguments for my party." And he won the case.</p><p>Every law has its opposite; every argument has its opposite. Every
proof, if it is only logical, has its opposite. Only love has no
opposite to it. The lawyer asked Jesus something; Jesus answered
something else. As if the lawyer was only asking for stones, and Jesus
gave him diamonds. In a way, it is irrelevant. In another way, in a
deeper way, this is the only way it should be. Diamonds were not asked
for -- the lawyer had no idea about those diamonds; he was only asking
about some coloured stones, at the most, semi-precious. Jesus gave him
diamonds -- tremendously valuable; he was asking about law, and Jesus
talked about love.</p><p>Always remember it: whenever you come to an enlightened man,
whatsoever you say is not the point. He talks out of his heart. In fact,
he does not answer your questions; he answers you, your deepest need,
about which you yourself are not aware.</p><p>It happens so many times when I am answering your questions. Many
times you feel as if your question has not been answered. I know it; I
am aware of it. It need not be answered. But through your question I can
feel a deep urge, a deep enquiry, about which you yourself are not
aware. You cannot be aware in the state you are in -- in your
unconsciousness you can ask only wrong questions. In my awareness I can
answer only right answers. I will repeat: in your sleep you can ask only
wrong questions; in my awareness I can answer only right answers.</p><p>On the surface it will look absurd.</p><p>There are three possibilities of dialogue: one, two ignorant persons
talking. Much talking goes on, but nothing happens out of it; it is just
bogus. They talk, but they don't mean what they are saying, they are not
even aware of what they are saying -- it is just an occupation; it feels
good to be occupied. They are talking like mechanical things, two
computers talking. Then there is the possibility of two enlightened
persons talking. They don't talk; there is no need to talk. The
communion is silent; they understand each other without the words. Two
ignorant persons talking -- too many words, and no understanding. Two
enlightened persons meeting -- no words, only understanding.</p><p>The first situation happens every day, millions of times all over the
earth; the second situation happens rarely after thousands and thousands
of years -- rarely does it happen that two enlightened persons meet.</p><p>There is a third possibility -- one enlightened person talking to an
unenlightened person. Then there are two planes: one is on the earth,
the other is in the sky; one is moving in a bullock cart, the other is
flying in an aeroplane. The person on the earth asks one thing and the
person in the sky answers something. else. But this is the only way,
this is the only way the person on the earth can be helped. The lawyer
had asked about the law. He had asked,</p><p>MASTER, WHICH IS THE GREAT COMMANDMENT IN THE LAW?</p><p>He is not asking about love; Jesus is trying to seduce him towards
love -- he has changed the whole pattern. Once it is in Jesus' hands,
then he will take you into a dimension you know not, into the unknown,
into the unknowable.</p><p>JESUS SAID UNTO HIM, THOU SHALT LOVE THE LORD THY GOD WITH</p><p>ALL THY HEART, AND WITH ALL THY SOUL, AND WITH ALL THY MIND.</p><p>WITH ALL THY HEART means with all thy feelings. That is what prayer
is.</p><p>When all your feelings are together, integrated into one unity, it is
prayer. Prayer is your total heart, throbbing with the desire of the
unknown, throbbing with a deep urge, a deep enquiry for the unknown,
each beat of your heart devoted.</p><p>WITH ALL THY MIND: that is the meaning of meditation, when all your
thoughts have become one. When all your thoughts become one, thinking
disappears; when all your feelings become one, feeling disappears. When
your feelings are many, you are sentimental; when your feelings are one,
all sentimentality disappears -- you are full of heart, but without any
sentimentality.</p><p>Prayer is not sentimentalism. Prayer is such a harmony of feelings,
such a total unity of feelings that the quality of the feelings
immediately changes. Just as you put water on to heat, it goes on
becoming warmer, warmer, hot, more hot -- up to 99o it is still water.
Then the 100o comes, and suddenly there is a transformation.</p><p>The water is no more water, it starts evaporating; and the quality
immediately changes. The water has a quality to flow downwards: when it
evaporates, the vapour has a quality to float upwards. The dimension has
changed.</p><p>When you live in feelings, so many feelings, you are just a
confusion, a madhouse. When all the feelings are integrated, there comes
a moment of transformation. When they all become one, you are at the
100o point, the evaporating point. Immediately the nature of the
feelings disappears. The old down-flowing is no more there; you start
evaporating like vapour towards the sky. That is what prayer is.</p><p>And the same thing happens when all your thoughts are one -- thinking
stops.</p><p>When thoughts are many, thinking is possible; when thoughts are one,
then there comes a moment that this oneness of thought becomes almost
synonymous with no-thought. To have one thought is to have no thought,
because the one cannot exist a]one. The one can exist only with the
many, the one can exist only in a crowd. When the crowd has disappeared,
the one also disappears, and there comes a state of no-thought.</p><p>So Jesus, in his small sentence, has condensed the whole of
religion.</p><p>THOU SHALT LOVE THE LORD THY GOD WITH ALL THY HEART: this</p><p>is what prayer is all about.</p><p>WITH ALL THY MIND: that is what meditation is all about.</p><p>AND WITH ALL THY SOUL: the soul is the transcendence of thinking and
feeling. The soul is beyond prayer and beyond meditation. The soul is
your nature -- it is the transcendental consciousness in you. Look at
yourself as a triangle -- on the lower base, feeling, thinking. But
feeling and thinking are the only two that you have been feeling up to
now; you don't know the third. The third can be known only when the
feeling becomes prayer, and starts moving upwards, and thinking becomes
meditation, and starts moving upwards. Then prayer and meditation meet
at a point -- that point is soul. Somewhere your heart and your mind
meet: that is you, that is a beyondness. That's what Jesus calls the
soul.</p><p>THIS IS THE FIRST AND GREAT COMMANDMENT.</p><p>Now he is using the language of the lawyer. He has said whatsoever he
wanted to say; now he comes to the language of the lawyer. The first
sentence belongs to Jesus' plane; the second sentence belongs to the
lawyer's plane. And he has tried to create a bridge between the two.</p><p>THIS IS THE FIRST AND THE GREAT COMMANDMENT: love is the first</p><p>and the great commandment. In fact, love is not a commandment at all,
because you cannot be commanded to love; you cannot be ordered to love,
you cannot be forced to love, you cannot manage and control love. Love
is bigger than you, higher than you -- how can you control it? And if
you are commanded to love, if somebody comes just as they do in the
army: "Right turn! Left turn!" -- and somebody comes and says, "Love!"
what can you do ~'Right turn' is okay.'Left turn' is okay. But'Love
turn'? -- you don't know where to turn, where to go; you don't know that
way -- it cannot be commanded.</p><p>Yes, you can pretend; you can act. That's what has happened on this
earth. The greatest curse that has happened on this earth is that love
has been forced. From the very childhood everybody is taught to love, as
if love can be taught.'Love your mother','Love your father','Love your
brothers','Love your sisters', love this, love that: and the child
starts trying -- because how can the child know that love cannot be an
act? It is a happening.</p><p>Just the other night I was saying... once it happened: A musician was
playing on his organ -- just sitting idle, with nothing to do; in a
playful mood, not serious at all -- in fun. Suddenly something happened
for which he had been waiting his whole life. He struck a chord. For
that chord he had been waiting, and waiting, and waiting. He had tried
his utmost and he had never been able to manage it; and suddenly it was
there... and he had just been fingering the keys. He was thrilled,
ecstatic. He danced. And then he tried again. But he could not get it
again. He tried hard -- the harder he tried, the more frustrated he was.
For months he became almost mad. He tried and tried, day and night; and
the more he tried, the further away it looked. In fact, after a few
weeks he started to wonder if it had ever happened, or if he had
imagined it. The memory of it had also gone so far away that he started
thinking, "Maybe I simply dreamt about it, and it has not happened."
Then he dropped the whole subject. Then he forgot about it.</p><p>Again one day after a few months, he was just sitting at the organ,
fingering the keys. Again it was there; again it happened. He was
thrilled; he was ecstatic. But now he understood -- it happened only
when he was not there. Then he never tried; then he never tried to bring
it back. It started to happen almost every day.</p><p>It started to happen, by and by, whenever he touched the keys. It
became a natural flow.</p><p>Love is just like that. You cannot force it. You have been missing
because you have been trying too hard. The more I look and observe you,
the more I feel your desert-like state. Everybody is in search of love.
You may call it God, you may call it something else; but deep down I
know you are in search of love. But you have become incapable, not
because you have not tried, but because you have tried too hard.</p><p>Love is a happening; it cannot be commanded. Because you have been
commanded to love, your love has been falsified from the very beginning,
poisoned from the very source. Never say to a child -- never commit this
sin --</p><p>never say to a child, "Love your mother." Love the child, and let
love happen.</p><p>Don't say, "Love. Love me, because I am your mother, or I am your
father. Love me." Don't make it a commandment; otherwise your child will
miss for ever and ever. Just love him. In a loving milieu, one day
suddenly the chord just happens, the harmony is found in the innermost
organ of your being. Something starts; some melody, some harmony arises,
and then you know that it is your nature.</p><p>But then you never try to do it; then you simply relax and allow it
to be.</p><p>THIS IS THE FIRST AND GREAT COMMANDMENT. Jesus is using the</p><p>language of the lawyer, because he is answering him; otherwise love
is not a commandment, and cannot be a commandment.</p><p>AND THE SECOND IS LIKE UNTO IT, THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS
THYSELF:</p><p>The first is, love thy God. God means the total, the tao, the brahma.
God is not a very good word; tao is far better -the total, the whole,
the existence -- love existence. That is the first, the most
fundamental.</p><p>AND THE SECOND IS LIKE UNTO IT, THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS
THYSELF;</p><p>... because it is difficult to find God, and it is difficult to love
God, if you have not found him already. How can you love God, who is
unknown? How can you love the unknown? You need some bridge, you need
some familiarity. How can</p><p>you love God? It looks absurd; it is absurd.Hence the second
commandment. AND THE SECOND IS LIKE UNTO IT, THOU SHALT LOVE THY
NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF:</p><p>I was reading a story -- I liked it. A learned man asked Rabbi
Abraham, "They say that you give people mysterious drugs, and that your
drugs are effective.</p><p>Give me one, that I may attain to the fear of God."</p><p>"I don't know any drug for the fear of God," said the Rabbi. "But, if
you like, I can give you one for the love of God."</p><p>'That is even better!" cried the scholar. "Just you give it to me.
"It is the love of one's fellow men," answered the Rabbi.</p><p>If you real]y want to love God, you have to start by loving your
fellow men, because that is the nearest God is to you. And by and by,
ripples of your love can go on expanding. Love is like a pebble thrown
into a silent lake: ripples arise, and then they start spreading tO the
faraway shores. But -- first the touch of the pebble on the lake; close
to the pebble they arise, and then far and far away they spread.</p><p>First, you will have to love those who are like you -- because you
know them, because at least you can feel a certain familiarity, a
certain at-homeness with them. Then the love can go on expanding. Then
you can love animals, then you can love trees, then you can love rocks.
And then only can you love existence as such, not before then.</p><p>So, if you can love human beings, you have taken the first step. But
just the opposite has been happening on this unfortunate earth -- people
love God, and kill human beings. In fact, they say because they love God
so much, they have to kill. Christians kill Mohammedans, Mohammedans
kill Christians, Hindus kill Mohammedans, Mohammedans kill Hindus,
because they all love God -- in the name of God, they kill human
beings.</p><p>Their gods are false. Because if your God is true, if you have really
known what God means, if you have realised even a bit, if you have even
attained to just a</p><p>glimpse of what God is, you will love human beings; you will love
animals, you will love trees, you will love rocks -- you will Love. Love
will become your natural state of being. And if you cannot love human
beings, don't be deceived --</p><p>then no temple is going to help you.</p><p>Just two or three days before, one beautiful woman, a rare person,
came to see me. Her whole life she has been a humanist, not believing in
God, a no-sayer. She told me, "I am surprised that I am here." Her
surprise is natural. She had never been to any temple, to any church, to
the so-called religious people; and then she has come here. And not only
that she wanted to be initiated into sannyas. She could not believe
herself -- what was happening. But I could look into her. She has been
able to come to me because she has loved human beings. She has taken the
first step towards the temple. She may not have gone to any temple --
that is not needed. She may not have ever thought about God -- that is
not needed. But she has taken an authentic step; she has loved human
beings. She has been a no-sayer, but that is the basis for saying yes.
She has earned her sannyas.</p><p>There are two types of people who come to me and want to be
initiated: a few who have not earned it -- she has earned it. Some will
start earning it only after they have taken sannyas -- for them it is a
beginning. But for that old woman it is not a beginning, it is a
culmination. She has arrived. Her whole life has been a preparation for
it. She said no. To say yes to human beings she denied God: perfectly
good -- as it should be. Say no to God, but never say no to human
beings, because if you say no to human beings, the path is cut; then you
will never be able to reach God. Say no to the church, to the temple;
there is no problem about it. But never say no to love, because that is
the real temple. All other temples are just false coins, pseudo-images,
not authentic. There is only one authentic temple, and that temple is
love. Never say no to love -- you will find God; God cannot hide for
long.</p><p>The second commandment, Jesus says,</p><p>THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF.</p><p>... because, in fact, all humanity is you, in many faces and in many
forms. Can't you see it -- that your neighbour is nobody else than you,
your own being in a different shape and form</p><p>Many rivers in the world are named after colours. In China we have
the Yellow River; somewhere in South Africa they have the Red River; in
the U.S., I have heard, they have the White River, the Green River, the
Purple River. In Spain they have a river, the Rio Tinto -- it has three
names. Somewhere it is known as the Green River, somewhere as the Red
River, somewhere as the White River.</p><p>The river itself has no colour; water is colourless, but the river
takes the colour of the terrain it passes through, the colour of the
shrubbery on the banks. If it passes a desert, of course it has a
different colour; if it passes through a forest, the forest is reflected
-- the shrubbery, the greenery -- it has a different colour. If it
passes through a terrain where the mud is yellow, it becomes yellow. But
no river has any colour. And every river, whether it is called white, or
green, or yellow, reaches naturally to its end, to its destiny, falls
into the ocean, and becomes oceanic.</p><p>Your differences are because of your terrain. Your colours are
different because of your terrain. But your innermost quality of being
is colourless; it is the same.</p><p>Somebody is black, a negro; somebody is white, an Englishman;somebody
is just in them middle, an Indian; somebody is yellow, a Chinese -- so
many colours.</p><p>But remember, these are the colours of the terrain of the body you
pass through. They are not your colours; you are colourless.</p><p>In India, we have a name for the sannyasin -- we call him VIRAGI.
That means colourless. RAG means colour; VIRAG means colourlessness; and
VIRAGI is one who has come to know his colourless being.</p><p>You are not the body; neither are you the mind, nor are you the
heart. Your mind differs, because it has been conditioned differently;
your body is different, because it has come through a different terrain,
through a different heredity; but you are not different.</p><p>Jesus says: THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF. As you</p><p>love yourself, love your neighbour. And one thing very basic, which
Christians have completely forgotten Jesus says, "Love thyself," and,
"Love thy neighbour as thyself"</p><p>Unless you love yourself, you cannot love your neighbour.All the
so-called Christianity has been teaching you hatred towards yourself,
condemnation towards yourself. Love yourself, because you are the
nearest to God. It is there that the first ripple has to arise. Love
yourself. Self-love is the most fundamental thing -- if you ever want to
be religious, self-love is the basis. And all so-called religions go on
teaching you self-hatred: "Condemn yourself, you are a sinner, guilty --
this and that -- you are worthless."</p><p>You are not a sinner. They have made you so. You are not guilty. They
have given you wrong interpretations of life. Accept yourself, and love
yourself. Only then can you love your neighbour, otherwise there is no
possibility. If you don't love yourself, how can you love another
being.? I teach you self-love. At least do that; if you cannot do
anything else -- love yourself. And out of your self- love, by and by
you will see love is starting to flow; it is expanding; it is reaching
to the neighbours.</p><p>The whole problem today is that you hate yourself and you want to
love somebody else, which is impossible. And the other also hates
himself, and he wants to love you. That lesson has to be learned first
within yourself.</p><p>If you ask Freud and the psychoanalysts, they have come to discover a
very basic thing. They say -- first, the child is autoerotic,
masturbatory; the child loves himself. Then the child becomes homosexual
-- the boys love boys and want to play with boys; girls want to play
with girls, and they don't want to mix with each other. And then arises
heterosexuality -- the boy wants to mix, and love a girl; a girl wants
to meet a boy and love. First, auto-erotic, then homo- erotic, then
hetero-erotic -- this is about sex. The same is true about love.</p><p>First, you love yourself Then you love your neighbour, other human
beings. And then you move beyond: you love existence. But the basis is
you. So don't condemn yourself; don't reject yourself. Accept. God has
taken abode in you. He has loved you so much, that's why he has taken
abode in you. He has made a temple of you; he lives in you. If you
reject yourself, you reject the nearest to God that you can find. If you
reject the nearest, it is impossible that you will love the faraway.</p><p>When Jesus says: THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF, he</p><p>is saying two things: first, love thyself, so that you can be capable
of loving thy neighbour.</p><p>ON THESE TWO COMMANDMENTS HANG ALL THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS.</p><p>In fact it is one commandment, Love. Love is the one and only order
of things. If you have understood love, you have understood all. If you
have not understood love, you may know many things, but all that
knowledge is simply rot. Throw it on a rubbish heap and forget all about
it. Start from the very beginning. Be a child again, and start loving
yourself again.</p><p>Your lake, as I see it, has no ripples. The first pebble of love has
not fallen in it.</p><p>I have heard a Danish story. Remember it -- let it become part of
your mindfulness. The story tells about a spider who lived high up in
the rafters of an old barn. One day he let himself down by a long thread
to a lower beam, where he found the flies were more plentiful and more
easily caught. He therefore decided to live permanently at this lower
level, and spun himself a comfortable web there. But one day he happened
to notice the line down which he had come, stretching away into the
darkness above. "I don't need this any more," he said. "It only gets in
the way." He snapped it, and with it destroyed his whole web, which
needed it for support.</p><p>This is the story of man also. A thread joins you with the ultimate,
the highest; call it God. You may have completely forgotten that you
have descended from there. You come from God, and you have to go back to
him. Everything goes back to the original source; it has to be so. Then
the circle is complete, and one is fulfilled. And you may even feel like
this spider, that the thread that joins you to the highest comes in the
way. Many times because of it you cannot do many things: again and again
it comes in the way. You cannot be violent as you would like to be; you
cannot be aggressive as you would like to be; you cannot hate as much as
you would like to hate -- the line comes again and again in the way.</p><p>And sometimes you may feel like this spider: to cut it, to snap at
it, so that your path is clear.</p><p>That's what Nietzsche says: "God is dead." He snapped at it. But
immediately Nietzsche became mad. The moment he said, "God is dead," he
became mad, because then you are cut away from the original source of
all life. Then you are starved of something very vital, essential. Then
you miss something, for you had become completely oblivious that it was
the very base. The spider snapped at the</p><p>thread, and with it destroyed his whole web, which needed it for
support.</p><p>Wherever you are, in your darkest night, a ray of light is still
joined with you from God, from existence. That is your life; that's how
you are alive. Find out that thread, because that is going to be the way
back home.</p><p>On 5th June, 1910, O'Henry was dying. It was getting dark. Friends
were surrounding him. Suddenly he opened his eyes and said, "Put the
light up. I don't want to go home in darkness." The light was put up; he
closed his eyes, smiled, and disappeared.</p><p>The thread that is joining you, the single ray of life that is making
you alive, is the way back home. Howsoever far you have gone, you are
still joined with God</p><p>-- otherwise it would not be possible. You may have forgotten him,
but he has not forgotten you; and that is the real thing that
matters.</p><p>Try to find out something in you which joins you to existence. Search
for it, and you will come to the commandment Jesus is talking about. If
you search, you will come to know it is love, not knowledge, that joins
you to existence; not riches, not power, not fame -- it is love that
joins you to existence. And whenever you feel love, you are tremendously
happy, because more and more life becomes available to you.</p><p>Jesus, or a Buddha, both are like a honey-bee. The honey-bee goes and
finds beautiful flowers in a valley. She comes back, she dances a dance
of ecstasy near her friends to tell them that she has found a beautiful
valley full of flowers.</p><p>Come, follow me. A Jesus is just a honey-bee who has found the
original source of life: a valley of beautiful flowers, flowers of
eternity. He comes and dances near you to give you the message: Come,
follow me.</p><p>If you try to understand and seek within you, you will find it is
love that is the most significant, most essential thing in your being.
Don't starve it. Help it to grow, so that it can become a big tree; so
that birds of heaven can take shelter in you; so that in your love,
tired travellers on the path can rest; so that you can share your love;
so that you can also become a honey-bee. In your ecstasy, you can also
tell people to come and follow you. Each and everyone has to become a
Jesus one day, and don't be contented for less. Unless you become a
Jesus, you cannot be a Christian. If you are satisfied by being a
Christian, you are fooling</p><p>yourself. Be a Jesus -- less than that is not worthwhile. And you can
be, because in fact you are. Only a recognition... just a
recognition.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=come-follow-to-you-vol-3>Come Follow To You, Vol 3</h3><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

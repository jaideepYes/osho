‌CHAPTER 1
One whose arrow is shot
21 April 1977 am in Buddha Hall
THE ROYAL SONG OF SARAHA
I BOW DOWN TO NOBLE MANJUSRI
I BOW DOWN TO HIM WHO HAS CONQUERED THE FINITE AS CALM WATER LASHED BY WIND
TURNS INTO WAVES AND ROLLERS, SO THE KING THINKS OF SARAHA
IN MANY WAYS, ALTHOUGH ONE MAN. TO A FOOL WHO SQUINTS</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Hingle de jibity dangely ji
30 April 1977 am in Buddha Hall
The first question – it is from Prabha:
Question 1
DEAR OSHO, HINGLE DE JE, BIPITY JANG DANG – DO RUN NUN, DE JUN BUNG. HINGLE DE JIBBITY DANGELY JI.
THIS IS WONDERFUL, PRABHA! THIS IS BEAUTIFUL. This is just far out, baby. I am driving you sane. Just a step more... and the Enlightenment.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
The goose is out!
22 April 1977 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
IS THERE ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE APPROACHES OF SHIVA AND SARAHA TOWARDS TANTRA?
NOT REALLY, NOT ESSENTIALLY. But as far as the form is concerned, yes. Religions differ only in the form. Religions differ only in their methodology. Religions differ as far as the door into the Divine is concerned, but not existentially.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
This honey is yours
23 April 1977 am in Buddha Hall
AS A CLOUD THAT RISES FROM THE SEA ABSORBING RAIN, THE EARTH EMBRACES, SO, LIKE THE SKY, THE SEA REMAINS WITHOUT INCREASING OR DECREASING. SO FROM SPONTANEITY THAT’S UNIQUE,
REPLETE WITH THE BUDDHA’S PERFECTIONS, ARE ALL SENTIENT BEINGS BORN, AND IN IT COME
TO REST. BUT IT IS NEITHER CONCRETE NOR ABSTRACT.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
Love is death
24 April 1977 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
OSHO, YOU ARE EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE EVER WANTED OR COULD EVER WANT. SO WHY IS THERE SO MUCH RESISTANCE IN ME TOWARDS YOU?
THAT’S WHY – if you have deep love for me, there will be deep resistance also. They balance each other. Wherever love is, there is resistance too.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
Man is a myth
25 April 1977 am in Buddha Hall
TO A FLY THAT LIKES THE SMELL OF PUTRID
MEAT, THE FRAGRANCE OF SANDALWOOD IS FOUL. BEINGS WHO DISCARD NIRVANA
COVET COARSE SAMSARA’S REALM.
AN OX’S FOOTPRINTS FILLED WITH WATER
WILL SOON DRY UP; SO WITH A MIND THAT’S FIRM BUT FULL OF QUALITIES THAT ARE NOT PERFECT, THESE IMPERFECTIONS WILL IN TIME DRY UP.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
I am a destroyer
26 April 1977 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
I HAVE TAKEN LATELY TO DAYDREAMING ABOUT ENLIGHTENMENT – EVEN MORE DELICIOUS THAN LOVE AND FAME.
HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ABOUT DAYDREAMING?
THE QUESTION IS FROM PREM PANKAJA. Daydreaming is perfectly okay as far as love and fame are concerned – they are part of a dream world.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
Truth is neither holy nor unholy
27 April 1977 am in Buddha Hall
IT IS IN THE BEGINNING, IN THE MIDDLE, AND
THE END; YET END AND BEGINNING ARE NOWHERE ELSE.
ALL THOSE WITH MINDS DELUDED BY INTERPRETATIVE THOUGHTS ARE IN TWO MINDS AND SO DISCUSS NOTHINGNESS AND COMPASSION AS TWO THINGS.
BEES KNOW THAT IN FLOWERS HONEY CAN BE FOUND.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
Be true to love
28 April 1977 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
I AM A FROG. I KNOW I’M A FROG BECAUSE I LIKE SWIMMING IN MURKY DARK GREEN WATER AND HOPPING ABOUT IN SLIMY MUD. AND WHAT IS HONEY ANYWAY? IF A FROG CAN BE IN AN UNPATTERNED STATE OF BEING, WILL IT BECOME A BEE?</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
Mind immaculate in its very being
29 April 1977 am in Buddha Hall
WHEN (IN WINTER) STILL WATER BY THE WIND IS STIRRED, IT TAKES (AS ICE) THE SHAPE AND TEXTURE OF A ROCK.
WHEN THE DELUDED ARE DISTURBED BY INTERPRETATIVE THOUGHTS, THAT WHICH IS AS YET UNPATTERNED TURNS VERY HARD AND SOLID. MIND IMMACULATE IN ITS VERY BEING, CAN NEVER BE</description>

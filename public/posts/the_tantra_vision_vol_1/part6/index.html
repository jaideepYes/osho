Daydreaming is perfectly okay as far as love and fame are concerned – they are part of a dream world. You can dream as much as you like. Love is a dream, so is fame; they are not against dreaming. In fact, when dreaming stops, they disappear. They exist in the same dimension, the dimension of dream.\nBut you cannot dream about Enlightenment. Enlightenment is possible only when dreaming disappears. Enlightenment is absence of dreaming – day or night, that doesn’t matter. Enlightenment means now your consciousness is fully aware. In an aware consciousness dreaming cannot exist. Dreaming is like darkness. It exists when the light is not there. When the light is there, darkness simply cannot exist.\nDreaming exists because life is dark, dim, dismal. Dreaming exists as a substitute – because we don’t have real joy, hence we dream; because we don’t really have anything in life, hence we dream; otherwise, how will we be able to tolerate the emptiness that we are? how will we be able to tolerate our existence? It will be absolutely unbearable. Dreams make it bearable. Dreams help us. They\nsay to us, “Wait. Today things are not going right? Don’t be worried: tomorrow everything will be put right. Everything HAS to be right. We will try – maybe we have not tried enough yet. Maybe we have not worked in the right direction. Maybe fate was not with us, God was against us, but it cannot be for ever.” And God is compassionate, kind; all the religions of the world say God is very kind, very compassionate. It is a hope!\nMohammedans continuously repeat: God is Rahim, Rehman – compassionate, kind. Why? For what do they repeat again and again? Each time they utter the word’God’ they will repeat’the compassionate, the kind’. Why? If He is not kind then where will our hope and dreaming exist. He HAS to be kind for our dreams to exist, because THERE exists our hope: in His kindness, in His compassion. Tomorrow things will be okay; tomorrow they are going to be okay.\nDaydreaming is good as far as love and fame are concerned, as far as outgoing energies are concerned – because outgoing, we are going in a dream. The world is a dream phenomenon; that is what Hindus mean when they call it MAYA illusion. It is made of the same stuff dreams are made of. It is a daydream seen with open eyes.\nBut Enlightenment is a totally different plane of being. Dreams don’t exist there. And if you continue to dream, Enlightenment will not be possible.\nJust the other day I was reading a beautiful anecdote:\nA parson had a parrot, but despite all efforts to try and teach it to speak the bird remained dumb. The parson mentioned this one day to an elderly lady parishioner who visited him. She was interested and said, “I also have a parrot which does not speak. It might be a good idea to put the two birds together and see what happens.”\nWell, this they did, the parrots being put in a large cage while the parson and his lady parishioner withdrew out of sight but not out of hearing. At first all was quiet, then came some fluttering and the old lady’s parrot was heard to exclaim, “What about a spot of love, deary?” to which the parson’s parrot replied, “That’s what I have been silently praying and waiting for for years today my dream is fulfilled. I can speak today.”\nIf you are waiting and praying and dreaming for love and fame, it will happen one day! It is not a difficult phenomenon. One just needs stubbornness... and it happens. One just needs to go on and on and on... it is bound to happen, because it is YOUR dream. You will find some place or other where you can project it and you can see it, almost as if it has become a reality.\nWhen you fall in love with a woman or a man, what are you doing exactly? You were carrying a dream inside you; now suddenly the woman functions as a screen – you project your dream on her. You start feeling, “My dream is fulfilled.” The woman projects her dream on you; you function as a screen, and she feels her dream is fulfilled. If you go on dreaming, some day or other you will find a screen, somebody will become a screen, and your dream will be fulfilled.\nBut Enlightenment is not a dream. It is a dropping of all dreams. So please don’t dream about Enlightenment. Love is possible through dreaming in fact, it is possible only through dreaming. Fame is possible through dreaming – in fact, it is only possible through dreaming, it happens ONLY\nto dreamers. But Enlightenment is not possible through dreaming – the very existence of dreaming will make it impossible.\nDream for it and you will miss. Wait for it and you will miss. Hope for it and you will miss. Then what are you supposed to do? What you are supposed to do is to understand the mechanism of dreaming. You can leave Enlightenment aside; it is none of your business. You just look deep into the faculty of dreaming, understand how dreaming functions. That very understanding will bring a clarity. In that clarity dreaming stops, disappears.\nWhen dreaming is not, Enlightenment is.\nYou forget about Enlightenment! You are not to even think about it – how can you think about it? And whatsoever you think is going to be wrong. How can you hope for it? – ALL hopes about it are going to be wrong. How can you desire it? It cannot be desired. Then WHAT are we supposed to do?\nTry to understand desiring. Try to understand hoping. Try to understand dreaming. That’s what is needed. You simply try to understand how your mind has been functioning up to now. Seeing into the functioning of the mind, mind disappears. Just a good look into the inner mechanism of the mind, and suddenly it comes to a halt. In that halt, there is Enlightenment. In that halt, there is a taste of a totally new dimension of existence.\nDreaming is one dimension: existence is another dimension. Existence is: dreaming is simply a belief.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2\nYOU SPOKE IN SEVERAL RECENT DISCOURSES ON THE NO-PROBLEM, THE NON- EXISTENCE OF OUR PROBLEMS.\nHAVING BEEN BROUGHT UP IN A REPRESSIVE CATHOLIC FAMILY, AND HAVING SPENT TWENTY-ONE YEARS IN AN EQUALLY CRAZY EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM – ARE YOU SAYING THAT ALL THE COATS OF ARMOUR, ALL THE CONDITIONINGS AND ALL THE REPRESSIONS DO NOT EXIST, CAN BE DROPPED IMMEDIATELY – NOW?\nWHAT ABOUT ALL THE IMPRINTS LEFT ON THE BRAIN, ON THE MUSCULATURE OF THE BODY?\nTHIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT QUESTION – it is from Jayananda. The question is significant because it shows two different approaches concerning the inner reality of man.\nThe Western approach is to think about the problem, to find the causes of the problem, to go into the history of the problem, into the past of the problem, to uproot the problem from the very beginning, to uncondition the mind, or to recondition the mind, to recondition the body, to take out all those imprints that have been left on the brain – this is the Western approach. Psychoanalysis goes into\nthe memory; it works there. It goes into your childhood, into your past; it moves backwards. It finds out from where the problem has arisen – maybe fifty years before when you were a child the problem arose in your relationship with your mother, then psychoanalysis will go back.\nFifty years of history! It is a very long, dragging affair. And even then it doesn’t help much – because there are MILLIONS of problems. It is not only a question of one problem. You can go into one problem’s history; you can look into your autobiography and find out the causes. Maybe you can eliminate one problem, but there are millions of problems. If you start going into each problem..to solve one life’s problems you will need millions of lives. Let me repeat it: to solve ONE life’s problems you will have to be born again and again, millions of times. This is almost impractical. This cannot be done. And all those millions of lives when you will be solving the problems of this life, those lives will create their own problems... and so on and so forth. You will be dragged more and more into the problems. This is absurd!\nNow, the same psychoanalytical approach has gone into the body: rolfing, bio-energetics, and other methods are there which try to eliminate imprints on the body, in the musculature. Again, you have to go into the history of the body. But one thing is certain about both the approaches, which are on the same logical pattern, that the problem comes from the past, so somehow it has to be tackled in the past.\nMan’s mind has always been trying to do two impossible things. One is: to reform the past – which cannot be done. The past has happened. You cannot REALLY go into the past. When you think of going into the past, at the most you go into the memory of it; it is not the real past, it is just the memory. The past is no more there, so you cannot reform it. This is one of the impossible goals of humanity; man has suffered very much because of it. You want to undo the past – how can you undo it? The past is absolute. The past means: all potentiality of it is finished; it has become actual. Now there is no longer any potentiality to reform it, to undo it, to redo it. You cannot do ANYthing with the past.\nAnd the second impossible idea that has always dominated the human mind is: to establish the future – which cannot be done again. Future means that which is not yet; you cannot establish it. Future remains unestablished. Future remains open. Future is pure potentiality! Unless it happens, you cannot be certain about it.\nPast is pure actuality – it has happened. Now nothing can be done about it.\nBetween these two, man stands in the present always thinking of the impossibles. He wants to make everything certain about the future, about tomorrow – which canNOT be done. Let it sink as deeply in your heart as possible: it cannot be done. Don’t waste your present moment for making the future certain. The future is uncertainty; that is the very quality of the future. And don’t waste your time looking back. The past has happened, it is a dead phenomenon. Nothing can be done about it. What, at the most, you can do is you can reinterpret it. That’s all. That’s what psychoanalysis is doing: reinterpreting it. Reinterpretation can be done – but the past remains the same.\nPsychoanalysis and astrology: astrology tries somehow to make the future certain, and psychoanalysis tries to redo the past. Neither is a science. Both things are impossible, but both have millions of followers – because man LIKES it that way. He wants to be certain about the future,\nso he goes to the astrologer, he consults the I CHING, he goes to a Tarot reader, and there are a thousand and one ways to fool oneself, to deceive oneself.\nAnd then there are people who say they can change the past – he consults them also.\nOnce these two things are dropped, you become free of all sorts of foolishnesses. Then you don’t go to the psychoanalyst and you don’t go to the astrologer. Then you know the past is finished... you also be finished with it. And the future has not happened; whenever it happens, we will see – nothing can be done about it right now. You can only destroy the present moment, which is the only moment available, real.\nThe West has been continuously looking into the problems, how to solve them. The West takes the problems very seriously. And when you are going in a certain logic, given the premises, that logic looks perfect.\nI was just reading one anecdote:\nA great philosopher and world renowned mathematician is aboard an aeroplane. He is sitting in his seat and thinking great mathematical problems, when suddenly an announcement comes from the captain: “I am sorry, there will be a a slight delay. Engine number one has cut out and we are now flying on three engines.”\nAbout ten minutes later another announcement: “I am afraid there will be further delay – engines two and three have cut out and there is only number four left.”\nSo the philosopher turns to the fellow sitting next to him and says, “Good golly! If the other one cuts out we will be up here all night!”\nWhen you are thinking in a certain line, the very direction of it makes certain things possible, absurd things also possible. Once you have taken human problems very seriously, once you start thinking about man as a problem, you have accepted some premise you have taken the first step wrongly. Now you can go into the direction, and you can go on and on. Now such great literature has come up in this century about mind phenomena, psychoanalysis; millions of papers are written and treatises and books. Once Freud opened the doors of a certain logic, it dominated the whole century.\nThe East has a totally different outlook. First, it says no problem is serious. The moment you say no problem is serious, the problem is almost ninety-nine percent dead. Your whole vision changes about it. The second thing the East says is: the problem is there because you are identified with it. It has nothing to do with the past, nothing to do with its history. You are identified with it – that is the REAL thing. And that is the key to solve all problems.\nFor example: you are an angry person. If you go to the psychoanalyst, he will say, “Go into the past... how did this anger arise? In what situations did it become more and more conditioned and imprinted on your mind? We will have to wash out all those imprints; we will have to wipe them off. We will have to clean your past completely.”\nIf you go to an Eastern mystic, he will say, “You think that you are anger, you feel identified with the anger – that is where things are going wrong. Next time anger happens, you just be a watcher,\nyou just be a witness. You don’t get identified with the anger. Don’t say,‘I am anger.’ Don’t say,‘I am angry.’ Just see it happening as if it is happening on a TV screen. Look at yourself as if you are looking at somebody else.”\nYou are pure consciousness. When the cloud of anger comes around you, just watch it, AND remain alert so that you don’t get identified. The whole thing is how not to become identified with the problem. Once you have learnt it... and then there is no question of’so many problems’ – because the key, the same key will open all the locks. It is so with anger, it is so with greed, it is so with sex: it is so with everything else that the mind is capable of.\nThe East says: Just remain unidentified. Remember – that’s what Gurdjieff means when he says’self-remembering’. Remember that you are a witness! Be mindful! – that’s what Buddha says. Be alert that a cloud is passing by! Maybe the cloud comes from the past, but that is meaningless. It must have a certain past, it cannot come just out of the blue; it must be coming from a certain sequence of events – but that is irrelevant. Why be bothered about it? RIGHT NOW, this very moment, you can become detached from it, you can cut yourself away from it. The bridge can be broken right now – and it can be broken ONLY in the now.\nGoing into the past won’t help. Thirty years before, the anger arose and you got identified with it that day. Now you cannot get unidentified from that past; it is no more there. But you can get unidentified this moment, this very moment. And then the WHOLE series of angers of your past is no more part of you.\nTHE QUESTION IS RELEVANT. Jayananda has asked:” You spoke in several recent discourses on the no-problem, the non-existence of our problems. Having been brought up in a repressive Catholic family...”\nYou can, right now, become a non-Catholic. NOW! I say. You will not have to go back and undo whatsoever your parents and your society and the priest and the church have done. That will be a sheer wastage of precious present time. In the first place it has destroyed many years; now, again, it will be destroying your present moments. You can simply drop out of it, just as a snake slips out of the old skin.\n“Having been brought up in a repressive Catholic family, and having spent twenty-one years in an equally crazy educational system – are you saying that all the coats of armour, all the conditionings and all the repressions do not exist...?”\nNo, they exist. But they exist either in the body or in the brain; they don’t exist in your consciousness, because the consciousness cannot be conditioned. Consciousness REMAINS free! Freedom is its innermost quality, freedom is its nature. In fact, even asking it, you are showing that freedom.\nWhen you say “twenty-one years in a crazy educational system”; when you say “having been brought up in a repressive Catholic family” – in THIS moment you are not identified. You can look: so many years of Catholic repression, so many years of a certain education. In this moment when you are looking at it, this consciousness is no longer Catholic; otherwise, who will be aware? If you had really BECOME Catholic, then who would be aware? Then there would be no possibility of becoming aware.\nIf you can say “twenty-one years in an equally crazy educational system,” one thing is certain: you are not yet crazy. The system has failed; it didn’t work. Jayananda, you are not crazy, hence you can see the whole system as crazy. A madman cannot see that he is mad. Only a sane person can see that this is madness. To see madness as madness, sanity is needed. Those twenty-one years of crazy system have failed; all that repressive conditioning has failed. It CANNOT really succeed. It succeeds only in the proportion that you get identified with it. Any moment you can stand aloof... it is there, I am not saying it is not there: but it is no more part of your consciousness.\nThis is the beauty of consciousness: consciousness can slip out of anything. There is no barrier to it, no boundary to it. Just a moment before you were an Englishman – understanding the nonsense of nationalism, a second later you are no longer an Englishman. I am not saying that your white skin will change; it will remain white – but you are no more identified with the whiteness; you are no more against the black. You see the stupidity of it. I am not saying that just by seeing that you are no more an Englishman you will forget the English language, no. It will still be there in your memory, but your consciousness has slipped out, your consciousness is standing on a hillock looking at the valley. Now, the Englishman is dead in the valley and you are standing on the hills, far away, unattached, untouched.\nThe whole Eastern methodology can be reduced to one word: witnessing. And the whole Western methodology can be be Reduced to one thing: analyzing. Analyzing, you go round and round. Witnessing, you simply get out of the circle.\nAnalysis is a vicious circle. If you REALLY go into analysis, you will be simply puzzled – how is it possible? If, for example, you try to go into the past, where will you end? Where exactly? If you go into the past, where did your sexuality start? When you were fourteen years of age? But then it came out of the blue? It must have been getting ready in the body. So when? When you were born? But then when you were in the mother’s womb, wasn’t it getting ready? Then when? The moment you were conceived? But before that? Half of your sexuality was mature in your mother’s egg and half of the sexuality was maturing in your father’s sperm. Now go on..where will you end? You will have to go to Adam and Eve. And even then it does not end: you will have to go to Father God Himself. Why in the first place did He create Adam?...\nAnalysis will always remain half, so analysis never helps anybody really. It cannot help. It makes you a little more adjusted to your reality, that’s all. It is a sort of adjustment. It helps you to attain a little bit of understanding about your problems, their genesis, how they have arisen. And that little intellectual understanding helps you to adjust to the society better, but you remain the same person. There is no transformation through it, there is no radical change through it.\nWitnessing is a revolution. It is a radical change – from the VERY roots! It brings a totally new man into existence, because it takes your consciousness out of all the conditionings. Conditionings are there in the body and in the mind, but consciousness remains unconditioned. It is pure, always pure. It is virgin. Its virginity cannot be violated.\nThe Eastern approach is to make you mindful of this virgin consciousness, of this purity, of this innocence. That’s what Saraha is saying to the king again and again. Our emphasis is on the sky and the Western emphasis is on the clouds. Clouds have a genesis; if you find out from where they come, you will have to go to the ocean, then to the sunrays and the evaporation of the water and the\nclouds forming... and you can go on, but it will be moving in a circle. The clouds form, then again they come, fall in love with the trees, start pouring again into the earth, become rivers, go to the ocean, start evaporating, rising again on sunrays, become clouds, again fall on the earth.It goes\non and on, round and round and round. It is a wheel. From where will you be out? One thing will lead to another and you will be in the wheel.\nThe sky has no genesis. The sky is uncreated; it is not produced by anything. In fact, for anything to be, a sky is needed as a must, a priori; it has to exist before anything else can exist. You can ask the Christian theologian – he says “God created the world.” Ask him whether before He created the world there was any sky or not. If there was no sky, where did God used to exist? He must have needed space. If there was no space, where did He create the world? where did He put the world? Space is a must... even for God to exist. You cannot say “God created space.” That would be absurd, because then He would not have any space to exist. Space must precede God.\nSky has always been there. The Eastern approach is to become mindful of the sky. The Western approach makes you more and more alert to the clouds, and helps you a little, but it doesn’t make you aware of your innermost core. Circumference – yes, you become a little more aware of the circumference, but not aware of the center. And the circumference is a cyclone. You have to find the center of the cyclone. And that happens only through witnessing.\nWitnessing will not change your conditioning. Witnessing will not change your body musculature. But witnessing will simply give you an experience that you are beyond all musculature, all conditioning. In that moment of beyondness, in that moment of transcendence, no problem exists – not for you.\nAnd now it is up to you. The body will still carry the musculature and the mind will still carry the conditioning – now it is up to you: if sometimes you are hankering for the problem, you can get into the mindbody and have the problem and enjoy it. If you don’t want to have it, you can remain out. The problem will remain as an imprint in the bodymind phenomenon, but you will be aloof and away from it.\nThat’s how a Buddha functions. You also use memory; a Buddha also uses memory – but he is not identified with it. He uses memory as a mechanism. For example, I am using language. When I have to use language, I use the mind and all the imprints, but continuously I am not the mind – that awareness is there. So I remain the boss, the mind remains a servant. When the mind is called, it comes; its utility is there – but it cannot dominate.\nSo your question is right: problems WILL exist, but they will exist only in the seed form in the body and the mind. How can you change your past? You have been a Catholic in the past; if for forty years you have been a Catholic, how can you change those forty years and NOT be a Catholic? No. Those forty years will remain as a period of being Catholic. No – but you can slip out of it. Now you know that that was just identification. Those forty years cannot be destroyed, and there is no need to destroy them. If you are the master of the house, there is no need. You can use even those forty years in a certain way, in a creative way. Even that crazy education can be used in a creative way.\n“What about all the imprints left on the brain, on the musculature of the body?”\nThey will be there, but as a seed: potentially there. If you feel too lonely and you want problems, you can have them. If you feel too miserable without misery, you can have them. They will remain\nalways available, but there is no need to have them, there is no necessity to have them. It will be your choice.\nThe future humanity will have to decide whether it has to go on the path of analysis or it has to change to the path of witnessing. I use both methods. I use analysis, particularly for seekers who come from the West – I put them in the groups. Those groups are analytical, those groups are by-products of psychoanalysis. They have grown: Freud will not be able to recognize encounter if he comes; or primal therapy will be difficult for him to recognize – what is happening? Have all these people gone mad? But they are offshoots of HIS work; he was the pioneer; without him there would be no primal therapy. He started the whole game.\nWhen Western people come to me, I put them into the groups. That is good for them. They should start with what is easier for them. Then by and by, slowly I change. First they go into cathartic groups like encounter, primal therapy, and then I start putting them into intensive enlightenment, then vipassana. Vipassana is a witnessing. From encounter to vipassana there is a great synthesis. When you move from encounter to vipassana, you are moving from West to East.\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3\nDO YOUR ACTIONS ALSO BRING THE SAME PROPORTION OF GOOD AND BAD IN THE WORLD?\nWHAT ACTIONS? Can you detect any actions in me... except talking? And in that too I take every care to contradict everything I say. So in. the end, just emptinessThat is the use of contradiction.\nIf I say plus one, IMMEDIATELY I say minus one – and the total result is zero.\nI am not a doer. I don’t do anything. All that you can call action is my talking to you. And that is so contradictory that it cannot bring either good or bad. I go on negating myself. And if you understand this state of no-action, you will have understood the highest possibility of consciousness. The highest consciousness is not a doer. It is a being. And if something like action appears there, it is just playful. My talking is just a play.\nAnd the whole effort is that you don’t become dogmatic about me. You cannot become – I don’t allow that possibility. I contradict so much: how can you create a dogma? If you try to create a dogma, immediately you will find I have contradicted it.\nA Christian missionary used to come to see me, and he said, “You have spoken so much. Now what is needed is a small book which introduces your philosophy – something like a Christian catechism, in short.”\nI said, “That will be difficult. If somebody is going to put me In short’, he will go mad. And he will not find any way to choose and what to choose. Once I am gone, many people are going to become insane working on their Ph.D. theses on me – because I have said all that can be said, and I have denied all that can be denied.\nThe fourth question:\nQuestion 4\nA QUESTION IN BAD FAITH – WHY DO YOU TALK SO MUCH AGAINST THE EGO? ISN’T THE EGO ALSO A MANIFESTATION OF GOD, A GAME PLAYED BY EXISTENCE?\nIF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, then there is no problem about the ego. That is the whole purpose of why I go on talking against the ego so that you are not and God is. If you have come to such a deep understanding, that the ego is also God’s play, then it is perfectly good! Then there is no problem. Then there is no need to drop because you have nothing to drop.\nIf you understand that ego is also God’s play, then you are not in it. Everything is God’s – that’s what egolessness means – even ego.\nBut beware! You may be just playing a trick upon yourself, and mind is very cunning. In the name of God you may be trying to save your ego. It is up to you! But be watchful. If you have REALLY understood that all is God’s, then you are not.\nSo where is the ego? What does ego mean? It means: I have a private life; I am not part of the universal flux. I am not part of the river – I am swimming, I am going upstream; I have my own private goals. I don’t care where the existence is going; I have my own private goals, and I am trying to find them and achieve them Ego means having a private goal. Ego is idiotic.\nThe word idiot’ is very beautiful. It means having a private idiom. It means having a private goal, a private style. Ego is idiotic. It simply says that “I am not part of the universal: I am private, I am separate. I am an island, I don’t belong to the continent.” This not belonging to the whole is what ego is, this idea of being separate.\nThat’s why all the mystics have been saying: Drop the ego. What are they saying’? They are saying: Don’t be separate. Dropping the ego does not mean anything else: don’t be separate – be together with existence. And don’t flow against the river – that is foolish; you will be simply tired and defeated. Go with the river! All the way, go with the river. You are part of the river. And then there will be relaxation and rest and joy.\nWith the river there is joy. Against the river there is strain, anxiety. Ego creates anxiety and strain.\nNow, you ask: “Why do you talk so much against the ego’? Isn’t the ego also a manifestation of God, a game played by existence?”\nIf you have come to understand that, then to you at least I am not saying to drop the ego; then you don’t have any ego to drop. But be very careful and cautious. Mind is so cunning. I have heard this small anecdote:\nA monkey and a hyena were walking through the jungle together when the hyena said, “Every time I go through those bushes over there a big lion jumps out and keeps on hitting me and hitting me, and I don’t know why!”\n“Well, I will come with you this time,” said the monkey, “and I will stick up for you.”\nSo they walked along together, and just as they got to the bushes a lion jumped out on them and started hitting the hyena. The monkey just climbed up in a tree and watched, so when the lion had gone the half dead hyena asked the monkey, “Why didn’t you come down and help me?”\nAnd the monkey said, “You were laughing so much I thought you were winning.”\nBeware of the ego! It can find ways and means to protect itself. It can rationalize well; the ego is a great rationalist, and a rationalization is its whole foundation.\nThe fifth question:\nQuestion 5\nBELOVED OSHO, PLEASE SAY THIS TO ME SO I CAN STOP WORRYING ABOUT IT-\n“ARUP, EVERYTHING IS GOING ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFULLY WITH YOU. NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOUR MIND IS TRYING, NOW IT IS TOO LATE. I HAVE GOT YOU SAFELY UNDER MY WING AND THERE IS NO WAY BACK. AND YOU ARE GOING TO BE MORE AND MORE BLISSFUL FROM NOW ON.”\nTHANK YOU OSHO. I HOPE IT IS SO, BUT SOMETIMES I WAVER.\nTHE QUESTION IS FROM ARUP. Now, the first thing: you say that I have to say to you, “Everything is going absolutely beautifully with you.”\nJust by my saying it, it will not become beautiful. It may give you a consolation, but I am not here to give you any consolation. Either take the real thing or don’t bother at all. Consolation is a false thing. It is a toy to play with; it is just to pass time. And passing time is wasting time.\nAnd, another thing, you say, “Everything is going absolutely beautifully” – difficult. “Absolutely beautifully” – difficult. Nothing is absolute here on the earth... except witnessing. Ugly is not absolute, beautiful is not absolute. Happiness is not absolute, unhappiness is not absolute. Only witnessing. And when you witness, you neither feel ugly nor beautiful, neither happy, nor unhappy – you simply feel a witness.\nMy whole work is to make you a witness. You would like to have everything beautiful – you don’t want to be a witness. You want to have more pleasurable experiences. That’s why you constantly seek consolation. People come to me not really to be helped but to be consoled, just to be patted on the back. If I say everything is going good, they feel good, but how long is this feeling going to help? It will wear off sooner or later. Again they have to come, and again they wait for me to pat them on the head. This is not going to help you. You need a transformation. And this will create a dependence on me, and I am not to make you dependent on me – you have to be independent, you have to be your own self, you have to be on your own.\n“No matter how much your mind is trying, now it is too late.”\nIt is never too late! You can again slip into the old skin, you can again become identified with it. And when it is REALLY too late, then you will not ask this question. Then you will know that now there is\nno possibility of going back. This will be a certainty in you. This will be your own knowing. You will not need my certificate for it. Just because you need a certificate, it shows it has not happened – you are wavering.\nI have heard:\nMulla Nasrudin was standing in the court. “This crime was the work of a master criminal,” said the prosecutor, “and was carried out in a skillful, clever manner.”\nBlushing, Mulla Nasrudin, the defendant, rose to his feet and said, “Sir, flattery will get you nowhere – I ain’t gonna confess.”\nBut he has confessed. Arup has confessed – this is not a question, this is a confession – that she feels worried is natural. It is inhuman to expect no worry, at this stage at least. Sometimes she feels wavering; that is human, natural. It is good to accept it, rather than deny it, rather than create a screen and hide it. “Please say this to me so that I can stop worrying about it.”\nHow will you stop worrying about it? – just by my saying it? If it were so easy, I would have said it to everybody. It is not so easy. Whatsoever I say, you will interpret it in your own way, and you will find new worries. Whatsoever I say, you will have to interpret it – you cannot accept it totally, you cannot trust it totally. And I am not saying that you HAVE to trust it totally; I am saying this is simply natural. I don’t ask any unnatural thing from you. I don’t ask any absurd things from you. It is natural! Sometimes you waver, sometimes you are against me, sometimes you are very negative. Sometimes you feel just to drop everything and go away back to your old world. I don’t say that you are doing something criminal – no – it is just human. It is very natural. If you are not doing such things, then something is wrong, then something is amiss.\nWhatsoever I say will again be interpreted by the same worrying mind. Even if I say exactly: Yes, Arup, everything is going absolutely beautifully with you... you will think, “Was Osho joking? Does he really mean it?” The worrying mind will jump upon it. Your interpretations are bound to be there.\nListen to this small story:\nA priest was returning home late at night from a meeting. As he drove along, he suddenly remembered that he had not said evensong. He pulled up at the side of a quiet country lane, got out of his car and using the light of his car headlamps began to say the office.\nNot long after he had begun, and much to his surprise, a lorry came along. The driver of the lorry, thinking that something was wrong, stopped, let down his window, and asked, “Having a spot of trouble, mate?”\n“No, everything is alright, thank you,” replied the priest.\nThe driver put his lorry in gear and, not to be outdone as he pulled away, cried out, “All I can say is: that must be a helluva good book you are reading there!”\nNow just think of somebody reading a book on a lonely lane by the headlights of the car – what will you think? Can you imagine somebody reading the Bible? What is the hurry to read the Bible? Can\nsomebody be so interested in reading the Bible? Can’t he wait and go home and read it there? The lorry-driver must have interpreted according to his mind – he said, “All I can say is: that must be a helluva good book you are reading there!”\nYou continuously interpret. And you interpret, naturally, according to your mind. What I say will not be heard; you will hear it in your own way. If you are worrying, you will worry about it. If you are doubting, you will doubt about it. If you are negative, you will be negative about it. If you are trusting, you will trust.\nArup says, “Just say to me so that I can stop worrying about it.” No, worrying cannot be stopped that easy. My saying it will not help you will have to do something. You will have to do what I say. You will have to be a little more practical. You will have to do witnessing.\nThere were three very hungry tramps, and they came to the house where the governor was cooking rice, and he said to them that they could stay the night and whoever had the best dream could have some hot rice.\nSo the next morning the first trampsaid, “I dreamt that I was the king.” The second tramp said, “That’s nothing – I dreamt I was God Himself.”\nAnd the third tramp said, “My dream was very ordinary and I don’t stand a chance of winning at all: I dreamt about that hot rice getting cold, so I went down and ate it.”\nThis is what I mean by being practical. So, Arup, be practical! Do what I say – just my saying it won’t help... and the rice is really getting cold. You want me to help create a dream in you, and the rice is getting cold. You just go down and eat the rice!\nThis will just give you a dream if I say: “Arup, everything is going absolutely beautifully with you. No matter how much your mind is trying, now it is too late. I have got you safely under my wing and there is no way back.”\nIn the first place I cannot say it because the very desire to be safe and secure is against spiritual growth. I am pushing you into a dangerous realm. I am pushing you into an abyss. You would like to be safely under my wings – now, I am throwing you into the very turmoil of existence... with no safety, with no security. I am not a protector – I am a destroyer. I am not your security. If you REALLY understand me, I am going to become your dangerous life.\nYou will always be insecure if you have understood me. You will never ask for safety and security. You will abhor safety and security. You will think of them as enemies – they are. You will enjoy being in the Open, vulnerable to all that is possible in life. Yes, vulnerable to death too;‘all’ includes death too. A REAL life is encountering death each moment. Only unreal, plastic lives are safe.\nNo, I cannot say that, that I have got you safely under my wing and there is no way back. You can fall, you can fall from the very last rung. Unless you become Enlightened, there is a way back; you can go back. You can deny, you can betray, you can reject. You can fall into the misery again – from the very last rung also you can fall. Until and unless you have crossed the whole ladder, even the\nlast rung, until and unless you are just a nobody, you can fall back. A slight ego, just a tremor of ego, is enough to bring you back. It can again condense, it can again integrate, it can again become a new trip.\nAnd safety is not my way. To be a sannyasin means you are ready to live life without safety. That is the greatest courage, and with that great courage, great bliss becomes possible.\n“And you are going to be more and more and more blissful from now on.”\nI am not an Emile Coue – I am not a hypnotist. Yes, you can hypnotize yourself this way. That was the very methodology of Coue. He would tell his patients, “Think, dream, imagine, visualize – each night before going to sleep, each morning after the sleep, repeat again and again and again’I am getting better, I am getting healthier, I am getting happier’ Repeat, go on repeating.”\nYes, it helps a little. It creates an illusion around you. But would you like me to help you in creating illusions? My whole approach is that of dehypnosis; it is not of hypnosis at all. I don’t want you to be hypnotized by any illusion. I want you to be utterly dehypnotized of all illusions. When you are in a state of disillusionment, utter disillusionment, Enlightenment is very close by.\nThen Arup says, “Thank you Osho. I hope it is so”\nSee! Her mind has already started interpreting.. “I HOPE it is so” It is not so – she simply hopes.\nHow you can deceive yourself!\n“I hope it is so, but sometimes I waver.”\nAnd I am not condemning your wavering – it is perfectly okay to waver sometimes, it is perfectly human to waver sometimes. It is perfectly right! Never condemn it! Accept it! Don’t try to create a false unwavering – that will be of the mind and will be a deception, and will not lead you anywhere. Let it be as it is. Accept it as it is, and become more and more watchful, become more and more of a witness. Only in that witnessing will you be safe. Only in that witnessing will you become more and more blissful every day – not by repeating it! Only in that witnessing will you stop wavering. Only in that witnessing will you come to the center of your being – where death exists not, where only life abundant is, where one is drinking the nectar Saraha talks about.\nThe sixth question:\nQuestion 7\nWHAT IS IT EXACTLY THAT IS OBSTRUCTING MY VISION FROM SEEING THE OBVIOUS? I JUST DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT TO DO AND WHAT NOT TO DO. WHEN WILL I BE ABLE TO HEAR THE SOUND OF SILENCE?\n“What is it exactly that is obstructing my vision from seeing the obvious?”\nTHE VERY DESIRE TO SEE IT. The obvious cannot be desired. The obvious is! You desire: you go away. You start seeking for it: in that very moment you have made it distant, it is no more obvious, it\nis no more close by; you have put it far away. How can you seek the obvious? If you understand it is obvious, how can you seek it? It is just there! What is the need to seek it and to desire it?\nThe obvious is the divine. The mundane is the sublime. And the trivial is profound. In your day-to- day, ordinary activities, you are meeting God every moment of it – because there is nobody else. You cannot meet anybody else; it is always God in a thousand and one forms. GOD IS VERY OBVIOUS. Only God is! But you seek, you desire... and you miss. In your very seeking you put God very distant, far away. That is an ego trick. Try to understand it.\nThe ego is not interested in the obvious, because the ego cannot exist with the obvious. The ego is NOT interested at all in the close-by. The ego is interested in the distant, faraway. Just think: man has reached to the moon, and man has not reached to his own heart yet... the distant. Man has invented space travel, but still he has not developed soul travel. He has reached Everest, but he does not bother to go into his own being. The close-by is missed and the faraway is sought. Why?\nThe ego feels good – if the journey is hard the ego feels good. There is something to prove. If it is difficult, there is something to prove. To go to the moon, the ego feels good, but to go into one’s own being will not be much of a claim.\nThere is an old story:\nGod created the world; then He used to live on the earth. You can imagine: His troubles were too many. Everybody was complaining; everybody was knocking at odd hours. In the night people would come and they would say, “This is wrong, and today we need rain and it is so hot.” And somebody would come just afterwards and he would say, “Don’t bring rains – I am doing something and it will spoil everything.” And God was getting almost mad: “What to do?! So many people, so many desires, and everybody expecting and everybody needs fulfillment, and their desires are so contradictory. The farmer wants the rain and the potter wants no rain, because he has made pots and they will be destroyed; he needs hot sun for a few days” – and so on and so forth.…\nThe God called His council and asked: “What to do? – they will drive me crazy. And I cannot satisfy them all. Or they will murder me someday! I would like some place to hide.”\nAnd they suggested many things. Somebody said, “That is not a problem – you just go to Everest. That is the highest peak in the Himalayas; nobody will ever reach there.”\nGod said, “You don’t know! Just after a few seconds” – for God that is just after a few seconds – “Edmund Hillary will reach there with Tensing, and then the trouble will start. And once they know, then they will start coming in helicopters and buses, and everything will.No, that won’t do. It will\nsolve things for a few seconds.” Remember, God’s time has a different way. In India we say millions of years is one day of God – so a few seconds.\nThen somebody suggested, “And why not the moon?”\nHe said, “That too is not very far – a few seconds more and somebody will reach the moon.”\nAnd they suggested faraway stars, but God said, “That is not going to solve the problem. It’s simply a sort of postponement. I want a permanent solution.”\nThen an old servant of God came close, whispered something in His ear, and God said, “You are right. That will do!”\nAnd the old servant had said, “There is only one place where man will never reach – you hide in man himself.” And that is the place where God has been hiding since then: in man himself. That is the last thing man will ever think.\nThe obvious is the missed, because ego is not interested. Ego is interested in hard, difficult, arduous things, because there is a challenge. When you win, you can claim. If the obvious is there and you win, what sort of victory is this? You are not much of a winner. That’s why man goes on missing the obvious and goes on seeking the distant.\nAnd how can you seek the distant when you cannot even seek the obvious? “What is it exactly that is obstructing my vision from seeing the obvious?”\nThe very desire is taking you astray. Drop the desire and you will see the obvious. “I just do not understand what to do and what not to do.”\nYou are not to do anything. You have just to be watchful of all that is happening around you. Doing is again an ego-trip. Doing, ego feels good – something is there to do. Doing is a food for the ego; it strengthens the ego. Non-doing, and ego falls flat on the ground. It dies. It is no more nourished.\nSo just be a non-doer. Don’t do anything as far as God, truth, and the search for it is concerned. It is not a search in the first place, so you cannot do anything about it. You just be. Let me say it in another way: if you are in a state of being, God comes to you. Man can never find Him; He finds man. Just be in a silent space, not doing anything, not going anywhere, not dreaming – and in that silent space suddenly you will find He is there. He has always been there! Just you were not silent, so you couldn’t see Him, you could not hear His still, small voice.\n“When will I be able to hear the sound of silence?”\nWhen? – you ask a wrong question. Now or never. Hear it now! because it is there, the music is on, the music is all over. Just you need to be silent so that you can hear it. But never say ‘when’; ‘when’ means you have brought future in; ‘when’ means you have started dreaming; ‘when’ means not now... and it is always now. It is always now-time. For God there is only one time: now; and only one place: here. ‘There’, ‘then’ – drop them.\nAnd the last question:\nQuestion 8\nOSHO, DO YOU EVER FEEL AT A LOSS WITH WORDS?\nTHE QUESTION IS FROM RISHI. Each time I utter a word, I feel at a loss – because that which I want to say cannot be said. And that which has to be conveyed, cannot be conveyed. Then you will naturally ask, why do I go on speaking?\nI am trying hard. Maybe today I have failed... tomorrow. Yesterday I failed... today. I go on speaking in different ways: maybe this way you have not heard; in some other way maybe it will be closer to you. This way somebody has heard; you have not heard. In another way maybe you will be able to hear it. But I am at a loss continuously. Words don’t come easily – because the message is wordless. I am not a priest; I am not trying to give you some dogma; I am not trying to explain some theory to you. Something has happened in me, something has happened to me – I am trying to convey THAT. I am trying to commune with you.\nWords are very awkward. They are very tiny and very small. They cannot contain that which I want them to contain. So EACH moment I am at a loss. People who don’t have any experience are never at a loss; any word will do.\nI have heard a beautiful story – meditate over it:\nA parish priest was having a few words with his Bishop, and in the course of conversation said, “It is alright for you, my lord, when you prepare a sermon you can deliver it to several churches in the diocese, but I have to give two new sermons every Sunday.”\nThe Bishop replied, “You should be able to give a sermon on almost any subject at a moment’s notice as I can.”\n“I will take you up on that,” said the parson. “You come to my church next Sunday and I will put you to the test.”\nThe bishop agreed and in due course went to the pulpit to find a card with the one word ‘constipation’ written on it – that was the subject. Without hesitation, he started: “And Moses took two tablets and went out on to the mountainside.”\nA priest is never at a loss. He has so many scriptures available, he can always find something from his memory. I am continuously at a loss – because what I want to say to you is not a subject matter: it is my subjectivity. What I WANT to say to you is my heart! it is not my mind. Unfortunately, I have to use the mind because there is no other way. Even to convey the heart one has to use the mind – hence the absurdity of it. It is very irrational. It is trying to do the impossible! But there is no other way... I am helpless.\nBut if you ask: Am I ever at a loss for words? I am constantly. Each single word, and I hesitate: will it do? How can it do? Knowing it is not going to help, I go on using it. It is a necessary evil. Silence would be better, far better, but when I LOOK at you then I hesitate. If I become silent, it will be even more difficult for you to come closer to me. You cannot understand the words, how will you be able to understand the silence? And if you can understand silence, you will be able to hear that silence in my words too.\nIf I become silent, then at the most five percent of you will be around me. Those five percent can understand through the words too, because they are listening to my silence not to my words. So there is no problem for those five percent. But the other ninety-five percent who cannot understand words and cannot understand the silence contained in them will be simply lost. I will not be able to help them at all. Through my words, they at least go on hanging around.\nIn their hanging around there is a possibility that in some unguarded moment they may have a contact with me, some unguarded moment and in spite of themselves they may come closer to me, they may stumble upon me; some unguarded moment, and I may penetrate into their heart, something may be stirred. It is a perhaps, but it is worth going on.\nThat five percent will be helped either way, but this ninety-five percent will not be helped by silence. And that five percent also, if I had been silent from the very beginning, would not be here. That five percent shows the way, so that the ninety-five percent by and by will be ninety percent, eighty-five percent, eighty percent.…\nThe day I feel at least fifty percent of people can understand silence, then words can be dropped. I am not very happy about them. Nobody ever was: neither was Lao Tzu, nor was Saraha, nor was Buddha – nobody ever was. But they all had to use words, not because silence cannot be a communion – silence can be a communion, but for that a very higher consciousness is needed.\nOnce it happened:\nTwo great mystics of India, Kabir and Farid, met, and for two days sat silently together. The disciples were very much frustrated: they wanted them to talk, they wanted them to talk so that they could hear something valuable. They were hoping, for months they were hoping, that Kabir and Farid would meet, and there would be a great showering, and they would enjoy it. But they were just sitting silently, and the disciples were dozing, yawning – what to do? And what happened to these two people? – because they were never silent before. Kabir was never silent with his disciples and neither was Farid silent with his disciples: they were continuously hammering on their disciples. “Why? What has happened? Have they gone dumb?” But they could not say anything; it was not appropriate.\nAfter two days, when Kabir and Farid hugged each other and said goodbye – that too in silence – and when the disciples were left with their Masters, they jumped upon their Masters. And the followers of Kabir said, “What went wrong? And for months we have been waiting for Farid to come, and he came, and you never spoke a single word. And we were waiting and waiting... we got tired! These two days have been hell!”\nAnd Kabir laughed. He said, “But there was nothing to say – he can understand silence. If I had said anything, he would have thought me ignorant – because when silence is there and silence can say it, what is the use of words?”\nAnd the followers of Farid asked Farid, “What happened? Why didn’t you speak?”\nFarid said, “Are you mad? Speaking with Kabir? We are exactly at the same space, so there is nothing to convey, nothing to say! The moment I looked into his eyes and he looked into my eyes, we recognized. The dialogue finished at the first moment!”\n“Then for two days... what were you doing for two days?”\nAnd Farid said, “We were just enjoying each other – each other’s space. We were guests to each other. We overlapped each other, we overflowed each other, we mingled with each other – we\ndanced, we sang. But it all happened in silence. When silence can speak, what is the need of language?”\nI am continuously at a loss for words. Each word I utter very hesitatingly, knowing well that it is not going to suffice, it is not adequate. Nothing is ever adequate – truth is so vast and words are so small.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"10181","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_tantra_vision_vol_1/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_tantra_vision_vol_1/>The Tantra Vision, Vol 1</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">6 I am a destroyer</h1><div class=post-meta>48 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;10181 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Tantra_Vision_Vol_1/part6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

DELICIOUS THAN LOVE AND FAME.</p><p><br></p><p>HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ABOUT DAYDREAMING?</p><p><br></p><p>THE QUESTION IS FROM PREM PANKAJA. Daydreaming is perfectly okay as
far as love and fame are concerned – they are part of a dream world. You
can dream as much as you like. Love is a dream, so is fame; they are not
against dreaming. In fact, when dreaming stops, they disappear. They
exist in the same dimension, the dimension of dream.</p><p><br></p><p>But you cannot dream about Enlightenment. Enlightenment is possible
only when dreaming disappears. Enlightenment is absence of dreaming –
day or night, that doesn’t matter. Enlightenment means now your
consciousness is fully aware. In an aware consciousness dreaming cannot
exist. Dreaming is like darkness. It exists when the light is not there.
When the light is there, darkness simply cannot exist.</p><p><br></p><p>Dreaming exists because life is dark, dim, dismal. Dreaming exists as
a substitute – because we don’t have real joy, hence we dream; because
we don’t really have anything in life, hence we dream; otherwise, how
will we be able to tolerate the emptiness that we are? how will we be
able to tolerate our existence? It will be absolutely unbearable. Dreams
make it bearable. Dreams help us. They</p><p>say to us, “Wait. Today things are not going right? Don’t be worried:
tomorrow everything will be put right. Everything HAS to be right. We
will try – maybe we have not tried enough yet. Maybe we have not worked
in the right direction. Maybe fate was not with us, God was against us,
but it cannot be for ever.” And God is compassionate, kind; all the
religions of the world say God is very kind, very compassionate. It is a
hope!</p><p><br></p><p>Mohammedans continuously repeat: God is Rahim, Rehman –
compassionate, kind. Why? For what do they repeat again and again? Each
time they utter the word’God’ they will repeat’the compassionate, the
kind’. Why? If He is not kind then where will our hope and dreaming
exist. He HAS to be kind for our dreams to exist, because THERE exists
our hope: in His kindness, in His compassion. Tomorrow things will be
okay; tomorrow they are going to be okay.</p><p><br></p><p>Daydreaming is good as far as love and fame are concerned, as far as
outgoing energies are concerned – because outgoing, we are going in a
dream. The world is a dream phenomenon; that is what Hindus mean when
they call it MAYA illusion. It is made of the same stuff dreams are made
of. It is a daydream seen with open eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>But Enlightenment is a totally different plane of being. Dreams don’t
exist there. And if you continue to dream, Enlightenment will not be
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I was reading a beautiful anecdote:</p><p><br></p><p>A parson had a parrot, but despite all efforts to try and teach it to
speak the bird remained dumb. The parson mentioned this one day to an
elderly lady parishioner who visited him. She was interested and said,
“I also have a parrot which does not speak. It might be a good idea to
put the two birds together and see what happens.”</p><p><br></p><p>Well, this they did, the parrots being put in a large cage while the
parson and his lady parishioner withdrew out of sight but not out of
hearing. At first all was quiet, then came some fluttering and the old
lady’s parrot was heard to exclaim, “What about a spot of love, deary?”
to which the parson’s parrot replied, “That’s what I have been silently
praying and waiting for for years today my dream is fulfilled. I can
speak today.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you are waiting and praying and dreaming for love and fame, it
will happen one day! It is not a difficult phenomenon. One just needs
stubbornness... and it happens. One just needs to go on and on and on...
it is bound to happen, because it is YOUR dream. You will find some
place or other where you can project it and you can see it, almost as if
it has become a reality.</p><p><br></p><p>When you fall in love with a woman or a man, what are you doing
exactly? You were carrying a dream inside you; now suddenly the woman
functions as a screen – you project your dream on her. You start
feeling, “My dream is fulfilled.” The woman projects her dream on you;
you function as a screen, and she feels her dream is fulfilled. If you
go on dreaming, some day or other you will find a screen, somebody will
become a screen, and your dream will be fulfilled.</p><p><br></p><p>But Enlightenment is not a dream. It is a dropping of all dreams. So
please don’t dream about Enlightenment. Love is possible through
dreaming in fact, it is possible only through dreaming. Fame is possible
through dreaming – in fact, it is only possible through dreaming, it
happens ONLY</p><p>to dreamers. But Enlightenment is not possible through dreaming – the
very existence of dreaming will make it impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>Dream for it and you will miss. Wait for it and you will miss. Hope
for it and you will miss. Then what are you supposed to do? What you are
supposed to do is to understand the mechanism of dreaming. You can leave
Enlightenment aside; it is none of your business. You just look deep
into the faculty of dreaming, understand how dreaming functions. That
very understanding will bring a clarity. In that clarity dreaming stops,
disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>When dreaming is not, Enlightenment is.</p><p><br></p><p>You forget about Enlightenment! You are not to even think about it –
how can you think about it? And whatsoever you think is going to be
wrong. How can you hope for it? – ALL hopes about it are going to be
wrong. How can you desire it? It cannot be desired. Then WHAT are we
supposed to do?</p><p><br></p><p>Try to understand desiring. Try to understand hoping. Try to
understand dreaming. That’s what is needed. You simply try to understand
how your mind has been functioning up to now. Seeing into the
functioning of the mind, mind disappears. Just a good look into the
inner mechanism of the mind, and suddenly it comes to a halt. In that
halt, there is Enlightenment. In that halt, there is a taste of a
totally new dimension of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Dreaming is one dimension: existence is another dimension. Existence
is: dreaming is simply a belief.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>YOU SPOKE IN SEVERAL RECENT DISCOURSES ON THE NO-PROBLEM, THE NON-
EXISTENCE OF OUR PROBLEMS.</p><p><br></p><p>HAVING BEEN BROUGHT UP IN A REPRESSIVE CATHOLIC FAMILY, AND HAVING
SPENT TWENTY-ONE YEARS IN AN EQUALLY CRAZY EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM – ARE YOU
SAYING THAT ALL THE COATS OF ARMOUR, ALL THE CONDITIONINGS AND ALL THE
REPRESSIONS DO NOT EXIST, CAN BE DROPPED IMMEDIATELY – NOW?</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT ABOUT ALL THE IMPRINTS LEFT ON THE BRAIN, ON THE MUSCULATURE OF
THE BODY?</p><p><br></p><p>THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT QUESTION – it is from Jayananda. The
question is significant because it shows two different approaches
concerning the inner reality of man.</p><p><br></p><p>The Western approach is to think about the problem, to find the
causes of the problem, to go into the history of the problem, into the
past of the problem, to uproot the problem from the very beginning, to
uncondition the mind, or to recondition the mind, to recondition the
body, to take out all those imprints that have been left on the brain –
this is the Western approach. Psychoanalysis goes into</p><p>the memory; it works there. It goes into your childhood, into your
past; it moves backwards. It finds out from where the problem has arisen
– maybe fifty years before when you were a child the problem arose in
your relationship with your mother, then psychoanalysis will go
back.</p><p><br></p><p>Fifty years of history! It is a very long, dragging affair. And even
then it doesn’t help much – because there are MILLIONS of problems. It
is not only a question of one problem. You can go into one problem’s
history; you can look into your autobiography and find out the causes.
Maybe you can eliminate one problem, but there are millions of problems.
If you start going into each problem..to solve one life’s problems you
will need millions of lives. Let me repeat it: to solve ONE life’s
problems you will have to be born again and again, millions of times.
This is almost impractical. This cannot be done. And all those millions
of lives when you will be solving the problems of this life, those lives
will create their own problems... and so on and so forth. You will be
dragged more and more into the problems. This is absurd!</p><p><br></p><p>Now, the same psychoanalytical approach has gone into the body:
rolfing, bio-energetics, and other methods are there which try to
eliminate imprints on the body, in the musculature. Again, you have to
go into the history of the body. But one thing is certain about both the
approaches, which are on the same logical pattern, that the problem
comes from the past, so somehow it has to be tackled in the past.</p><p><br></p><p>Man’s mind has always been trying to do two impossible things. One
is: to reform the past – which cannot be done. The past has happened.
You cannot REALLY go into the past. When you think of going into the
past, at the most you go into the memory of it; it is not the real past,
it is just the memory. The past is no more there, so you cannot reform
it. This is one of the impossible goals of humanity; man has suffered
very much because of it. You want to undo the past – how can you undo
it? The past is absolute. The past means: all potentiality of it is
finished; it has become actual. Now there is no longer any potentiality
to reform it, to undo it, to redo it. You cannot do ANYthing with the
past.</p><p><br></p><p>And the second impossible idea that has always dominated the human
mind is: to establish the future – which cannot be done again. Future
means that which is not yet; you cannot establish it. Future remains
unestablished. Future remains open. Future is pure potentiality! Unless
it happens, you cannot be certain about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Past is pure actuality – it has happened. Now nothing can be done
about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Between these two, man stands in the present always thinking of the
impossibles. He wants to make everything certain about the future, about
tomorrow – which canNOT be done. Let it sink as deeply in your heart as
possible: it cannot be done. Don’t waste your present moment for making
the future certain. The future is uncertainty; that is the very quality
of the future. And don’t waste your time looking back. The past has
happened, it is a dead phenomenon. Nothing can be done about it. What,
at the most, you can do is you can reinterpret it. That’s all. That’s
what psychoanalysis is doing: reinterpreting it. Reinterpretation can be
done – but the past remains the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Psychoanalysis and astrology: astrology tries somehow to make the
future certain, and psychoanalysis tries to redo the past. Neither is a
science. Both things are impossible, but both have millions of followers
– because man LIKES it that way. He wants to be certain about the
future,</p><p>so he goes to the astrologer, he consults the I CHING, he goes to a
Tarot reader, and there are a thousand and one ways to fool oneself, to
deceive oneself.</p><p><br></p><p>And then there are people who say they can change the past – he
consults them also.</p><p><br></p><p>Once these two things are dropped, you become free of all sorts of
foolishnesses. Then you don’t go to the psychoanalyst and you don’t go
to the astrologer. Then you know the past is finished... you also be
finished with it. And the future has not happened; whenever it happens,
we will see – nothing can be done about it right now. You can only
destroy the present moment, which is the only moment available,
real.</p><p><br></p><p>The West has been continuously looking into the problems, how to
solve them. The West takes the problems very seriously. And when you are
going in a certain logic, given the premises, that logic looks
perfect.</p><p><br></p><p>I was just reading one anecdote:</p><p><br></p><p>A great philosopher and world renowned mathematician is aboard an
aeroplane. He is sitting in his seat and thinking great mathematical
problems, when suddenly an announcement comes from the captain: “I am
sorry, there will be a a slight delay. Engine number one has cut out and
we are now flying on three engines.”</p><p><br></p><p>About ten minutes later another announcement: “I am afraid there will
be further delay – engines two and three have cut out and there is only
number four left.”</p><p><br></p><p>So the philosopher turns to the fellow sitting next to him and says,
“Good golly! If the other one cuts out we will be up here all
night!”</p><p><br></p><p>When you are thinking in a certain line, the very direction of it
makes certain things possible, absurd things also possible. Once you
have taken human problems very seriously, once you start thinking about
man as a problem, you have accepted some premise you have taken the
first step wrongly. Now you can go into the direction, and you can go on
and on. Now such great literature has come up in this century about mind
phenomena, psychoanalysis; millions of papers are written and treatises
and books. Once Freud opened the doors of a certain logic, it dominated
the whole century.</p><p><br></p><p>The East has a totally different outlook. First, it says no problem
is serious. The moment you say no problem is serious, the problem is
almost ninety-nine percent dead. Your whole vision changes about it. The
second thing the East says is: the problem is there because you are
identified with it. It has nothing to do with the past, nothing to do
with its history. You are identified with it – that is the REAL thing.
And that is the key to solve all problems.</p><p><br></p><p>For example: you are an angry person. If you go to the psychoanalyst,
he will say, “Go into the past... how did this anger arise? In what
situations did it become more and more conditioned and imprinted on your
mind? We will have to wash out all those imprints; we will have to wipe
them off. We will have to clean your past completely.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you go to an Eastern mystic, he will say, “You think that you are
anger, you feel identified with the anger – that is where things are
going wrong. Next time anger happens, you just be a watcher,</p><p>you just be a witness. You don’t get identified with the anger. Don’t
say,‘I am anger.’ Don’t say,‘I am angry.’ Just see it happening as if it
is happening on a TV screen. Look at yourself as if you are looking at
somebody else.”</p><p><br></p><p>You are pure consciousness. When the cloud of anger comes around you,
just watch it, AND remain alert so that you don’t get identified. The
whole thing is how not to become identified with the problem. Once you
have learnt it... and then there is no question of’so many problems’ –
because the key, the same key will open all the locks. It is so with
anger, it is so with greed, it is so with sex: it is so with everything
else that the mind is capable of.</p><p><br></p><p>The East says: Just remain unidentified. Remember – that’s what
Gurdjieff means when he says’self-remembering’. Remember that you are a
witness! Be mindful! – that’s what Buddha says. Be alert that a cloud is
passing by! Maybe the cloud comes from the past, but that is
meaningless. It must have a certain past, it cannot come just out of the
blue; it must be coming from a certain sequence of events – but that is
irrelevant. Why be bothered about it? RIGHT NOW, this very moment, you
can become detached from it, you can cut yourself away from it. The
bridge can be broken right now – and it can be broken ONLY in the
now.</p><p><br></p><p>Going into the past won’t help. Thirty years before, the anger arose
and you got identified with it that day. Now you cannot get unidentified
from that past; it is no more there. But you can get unidentified this
moment, this very moment. And then the WHOLE series of angers of your
past is no more part of you.</p><p><br></p><p>THE QUESTION IS RELEVANT. Jayananda has asked:” You spoke in several
recent discourses on the no-problem, the non-existence of our problems.
Having been brought up in a repressive Catholic family...”</p><p><br></p><p>You can, right now, become a non-Catholic. NOW! I say. You will not
have to go back and undo whatsoever your parents and your society and
the priest and the church have done. That will be a sheer wastage of
precious present time. In the first place it has destroyed many years;
now, again, it will be destroying your present moments. You can simply
drop out of it, just as a snake slips out of the old skin.</p><p><br></p><p>“Having been brought up in a repressive Catholic family, and having
spent twenty-one years in an equally crazy educational system – are you
saying that all the coats of armour, all the conditionings and all the
repressions do not exist...?”</p><p><br></p><p>No, they exist. But they exist either in the body or in the brain;
they don’t exist in your consciousness, because the consciousness cannot
be conditioned. Consciousness REMAINS free! Freedom is its innermost
quality, freedom is its nature. In fact, even asking it, you are showing
that freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>When you say “twenty-one years in a crazy educational system”; when
you say “having been brought up in a repressive Catholic family” – in
THIS moment you are not identified. You can look: so many years of
Catholic repression, so many years of a certain education. In this
moment when you are looking at it, this consciousness is no longer
Catholic; otherwise, who will be aware? If you had really BECOME
Catholic, then who would be aware? Then there would be no possibility of
becoming aware.</p><p>If you can say “twenty-one years in an equally crazy educational
system,” one thing is certain: you are not yet crazy. The system has
failed; it didn’t work. Jayananda, you are not crazy, hence you can see
the whole system as crazy. A madman cannot see that he is mad. Only a
sane person can see that this is madness. To see madness as madness,
sanity is needed. Those twenty-one years of crazy system have failed;
all that repressive conditioning has failed. It CANNOT really succeed.
It succeeds only in the proportion that you get identified with it. Any
moment you can stand aloof... it is there, I am not saying it is not
there: but it is no more part of your consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the beauty of consciousness: consciousness can slip out of
anything. There is no barrier to it, no boundary to it. Just a moment
before you were an Englishman – understanding the nonsense of
nationalism, a second later you are no longer an Englishman. I am not
saying that your white skin will change; it will remain white – but you
are no more identified with the whiteness; you are no more against the
black. You see the stupidity of it. I am not saying that just by seeing
that you are no more an Englishman you will forget the English language,
no. It will still be there in your memory, but your consciousness has
slipped out, your consciousness is standing on a hillock looking at the
valley. Now, the Englishman is dead in the valley and you are standing
on the hills, far away, unattached, untouched.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole Eastern methodology can be reduced to one word: witnessing.
And the whole Western methodology can be be Reduced to one thing:
analyzing. Analyzing, you go round and round. Witnessing, you simply get
out of the circle.</p><p><br></p><p>Analysis is a vicious circle. If you REALLY go into analysis, you
will be simply puzzled – how is it possible? If, for example, you try to
go into the past, where will you end? Where exactly? If you go into the
past, where did your sexuality start? When you were fourteen years of
age? But then it came out of the blue? It must have been getting ready
in the body. So when? When you were born? But then when you were in the
mother’s womb, wasn’t it getting ready? Then when? The moment you were
conceived? But before that? Half of your sexuality was mature in your
mother’s egg and half of the sexuality was maturing in your father’s
sperm. Now go on..where will you end? You will have to go to Adam and
Eve. And even then it does not end: you will have to go to Father God
Himself. Why in the first place did He create Adam?...</p><p><br></p><p>Analysis will always remain half, so analysis never helps anybody
really. It cannot help. It makes you a little more adjusted to your
reality, that’s all. It is a sort of adjustment. It helps you to attain
a little bit of understanding about your problems, their genesis, how
they have arisen. And that little intellectual understanding helps you
to adjust to the society better, but you remain the same person. There
is no transformation through it, there is no radical change through
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Witnessing is a revolution. It is a radical change – from the VERY
roots! It brings a totally new man into existence, because it takes your
consciousness out of all the conditionings. Conditionings are there in
the body and in the mind, but consciousness remains unconditioned. It is
pure, always pure. It is virgin. Its virginity cannot be violated.</p><p><br></p><p>The Eastern approach is to make you mindful of this virgin
consciousness, of this purity, of this innocence. That’s what Saraha is
saying to the king again and again. Our emphasis is on the sky and the
Western emphasis is on the clouds. Clouds have a genesis; if you find
out from where they come, you will have to go to the ocean, then to the
sunrays and the evaporation of the water and the</p><p>clouds forming... and you can go on, but it will be moving in a
circle. The clouds form, then again they come, fall in love with the
trees, start pouring again into the earth, become rivers, go to the
ocean, start evaporating, rising again on sunrays, become clouds, again
fall on the earth.<span class=s4></span>It goes</p><p>on and on, round and round and round. It is a wheel. From where will
you be out? One thing will lead to another and you will be in the
wheel.</p><p><br></p><p>The sky has no genesis. The sky is uncreated; it is not produced by
anything. In fact, for anything to be, a sky is needed as a must, a
priori; it has to exist before anything else can exist. You can ask the
Christian theologian – he says “God created the world.” Ask him whether
before He created the world there was any sky or not. If there was no
sky, where did God used to exist? He must have needed space. If there
was no space, where did He create the world? where did He put the world?
Space is a must... even for God to exist. You cannot say “God created
space.” That would be absurd, because then He would not have any space
to exist. Space must precede God.</p><p><br></p><p>Sky has always been there. The Eastern approach is to become mindful
of the sky. The Western approach makes you more and more alert to the
clouds, and helps you a little, but it doesn’t make you aware of your
innermost core. Circumference – yes, you become a little more aware of
the circumference, but not aware of the center. And the circumference is
a cyclone. You have to find the center of the cyclone. And that happens
only through witnessing.</p><p><br></p><p>Witnessing will not change your conditioning. Witnessing will not
change your body musculature. But witnessing will simply give you an
experience that you are beyond all musculature, all conditioning. In
that moment of beyondness, in that moment of transcendence, no problem
exists – not for you.</p><p><br></p><p>And now it is up to you. The body will still carry the musculature
and the mind will still carry the conditioning – now it is up to you: if
sometimes you are hankering for the problem, you can get into the
mindbody and have the problem and enjoy it. If you don’t want to have
it, you can remain out. The problem will remain as an imprint in the
bodymind phenomenon, but you will be aloof and away from it.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s how a Buddha functions. You also use memory; a Buddha also
uses memory – but he is not identified with it. He uses memory as a
mechanism. For example, I am using language. When I have to use
language, I use the mind and all the imprints, but continuously I am not
the mind – that awareness is there. So I remain the boss, the mind
remains a servant. When the mind is called, it comes; its utility is
there – but it cannot dominate.</p><p><br></p><p>So your question is right: problems WILL exist, but they will exist
only in the seed form in the body and the mind. How can you change your
past? You have been a Catholic in the past; if for forty years you have
been a Catholic, how can you change those forty years and NOT be a
Catholic? No. Those forty years will remain as a period of being
Catholic. No – but you can slip out of it. Now you know that that was
just identification. Those forty years cannot be destroyed, and there is
no need to destroy them. If you are the master of the house, there is no
need. You can use even those forty years in a certain way, in a creative
way. Even that crazy education can be used in a creative way.</p><p><br></p><p>“What about all the imprints left on the brain, on the musculature of
the body?”</p><p><br></p><p>They will be there, but as a seed: potentially there. If you feel too
lonely and you want problems, you can have them. If you feel too
miserable without misery, you can have them. They will remain</p><p>always available, but there is no need to have them, there is no
necessity to have them. It will be your choice.</p><p><br></p><p>The future humanity will have to decide whether it has to go on the
path of analysis or it has to change to the path of witnessing. I use
both methods. I use analysis, particularly for seekers who come from the
West – I put them in the groups. Those groups are analytical, those
groups are by-products of psychoanalysis. They have grown: Freud will
not be able to recognize encounter if he comes; or primal therapy will
be difficult for him to recognize – what is happening? Have all these
people gone mad? But they are offshoots of HIS work; he was the pioneer;
without him there would be no primal therapy. He started the whole
game.</p><p><br></p><p>When Western people come to me, I put them into the groups. That is
good for them. They should start with what is easier for them. Then by
and by, slowly I change. First they go into cathartic groups like
encounter, primal therapy, and then I start putting them into intensive
enlightenment, then vipassana. Vipassana is a witnessing. From encounter
to vipassana there is a great synthesis. When you move from encounter to
vipassana, you are moving from West to East.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>DO YOUR ACTIONS ALSO BRING THE SAME PROPORTION OF GOOD AND BAD IN THE
WORLD?</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT ACTIONS? Can you detect any actions in me... except talking? And
in that too I take every care to contradict everything I say. So in. the
end, just emptiness<span class=s4></span>That is the use of
contradiction.</p><p>If I say plus one, IMMEDIATELY I say minus one – and the total result
is zero.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not a doer. I don’t do anything. All that you can call action is
my talking to you. And that is so contradictory that it cannot bring
either good or bad. I go on negating myself. And if you understand this
state of no-action, you will have understood the highest possibility of
consciousness. The highest consciousness is not a doer. It is a being.
And if something like action appears there, it is just playful. My
talking is just a play.</p><p><br></p><p>And the whole effort is that you don’t become dogmatic about me. You
cannot become – I don’t allow that possibility. I contradict so much:
how can you create a dogma? If you try to create a dogma, immediately
you will find I have contradicted it.</p><p><br></p><p>A Christian missionary used to come to see me, and he said, “You have
spoken so much. Now what is needed is a small book which introduces your
philosophy – something like a Christian catechism, in short.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That will be difficult. If somebody is going to put me In
short’, he will go mad. And he will not find any way to choose and what
to choose. Once I am gone, many people are going to become insane
working on their Ph.D. theses on me – because I have said all that can
be said, and I have denied all that can be denied.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question:</p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>A QUESTION IN BAD FAITH – WHY DO YOU TALK SO MUCH AGAINST THE EGO?
ISN’T THE EGO ALSO A MANIFESTATION OF GOD, A GAME PLAYED BY
EXISTENCE?</p><p><br></p><p>IF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, then there is no problem about the ego. That
is the whole purpose of why I go on talking against the ego so that you
are not and God is. If you have come to such a deep understanding, that
the ego is also God’s play, then it is perfectly good! Then there is no
problem. Then there is no need to drop because you have nothing to
drop.</p><p><br></p><p>If you understand that ego is also God’s play, then you are not in
it. Everything is God’s – that’s what egolessness means – even ego.</p><p><br></p><p>But beware! You may be just playing a trick upon yourself, and mind
is very cunning. In the name of God you may be trying to save your ego.
It is up to you! But be watchful. If you have REALLY understood that all
is God’s, then you are not.</p><p><br></p><p>So where is the ego? What does ego mean? It means: I have a private
life; I am not part of the universal flux. I am not part of the river –
I am swimming, I am going upstream; I have my own private goals. I don’t
care where the existence is going; I have my own private goals, and I am
trying to find them and achieve them Ego means having a private goal.
Ego is idiotic.</p><p><br></p><p>The word idiot’ is very beautiful. It means having a private idiom.
It means having a private goal, a private style. Ego is idiotic. It
simply says that “I am not part of the universal: I am private, I am
separate. I am an island, I don’t belong to the continent.” This not
belonging to the whole is what ego is, this idea of being separate.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why all the mystics have been saying: Drop the ego. What are
they saying’? They are saying: Don’t be separate. Dropping the ego does
not mean anything else: don’t be separate – be together with existence.
And don’t flow against the river – that is foolish; you will be simply
tired and defeated. Go with the river! All the way, go with the river.
You are part of the river. And then there will be relaxation and rest
and joy.</p><p><br></p><p>With the river there is joy. Against the river there is strain,
anxiety. Ego creates anxiety and strain.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, you ask: “Why do you talk so much against the ego’? Isn’t the
ego also a manifestation of God, a game played by existence?”</p><p><br></p><p>If you have come to understand that, then to you at least I am not
saying to drop the ego; then you don’t have any ego to drop. But be very
careful and cautious. Mind is so cunning. I have heard this small
anecdote:</p><p><br></p><p>A monkey and a hyena were walking through the jungle together when
the hyena said, “Every time I go through those bushes over there a big
lion jumps out and keeps on hitting me and hitting me, and I don’t know
why!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, I will come with you this time,” said the monkey, “and I will
stick up for you.”</p><p>So they walked along together, and just as they got to the bushes a
lion jumped out on them and started hitting the hyena. The monkey just
climbed up in a tree and watched, so when the lion had gone the half
dead hyena asked the monkey, “Why didn’t you come down and help me?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the monkey said, “You were laughing so much I thought you were
winning.”</p><p><br></p><p>Beware of the ego! It can find ways and means to protect itself. It
can rationalize well; the ego is a great rationalist, and a
rationalization is its whole foundation.</p><p><br></p><p>The fifth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO, PLEASE SAY THIS TO ME SO I CAN STOP WORRYING ABOUT
IT-</p><p><br></p><p>“ARUP, EVERYTHING IS GOING ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFULLY WITH YOU. NO MATTER
HOW MUCH YOUR MIND IS TRYING, NOW IT IS TOO LATE. I HAVE GOT YOU SAFELY
UNDER MY WING AND THERE IS NO WAY BACK. AND YOU ARE GOING TO BE MORE AND
MORE BLISSFUL FROM NOW ON.”</p><p><br></p><p>THANK YOU OSHO. I HOPE IT IS SO, BUT SOMETIMES I WAVER.</p><p><br></p><p>THE QUESTION IS FROM ARUP. Now, the first thing: you say that I have
to say to you, “Everything is going absolutely beautifully with
you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Just by my saying it, it will not become beautiful. It may give you a
consolation, but I am not here to give you any consolation. Either take
the real thing or don’t bother at all. Consolation is a false thing. It
is a toy to play with; it is just to pass time. And passing time is
wasting time.</p><p><br></p><p>And, another thing, you say, “Everything is going absolutely
beautifully” – difficult. “Absolutely beautifully” – difficult. Nothing
is absolute here on the earth... except witnessing. Ugly is not
absolute, beautiful is not absolute. Happiness is not absolute,
unhappiness is not absolute. Only witnessing. And when you witness, you
neither feel ugly nor beautiful, neither happy, nor unhappy – you simply
feel a witness.</p><p><br></p><p>My whole work is to make you a witness. You would like to have
everything beautiful – you don’t want to be a witness. You want to have
more pleasurable experiences. That’s why you constantly seek
consolation. People come to me not really to be helped but to be
consoled, just to be patted on the back. If I say everything is going
good, they feel good, but how long is this feeling going to help? It
will wear off sooner or later. Again they have to come, and again they
wait for me to pat them on the head. This is not going to help you. You
need a transformation. And this will create a dependence on me, and I am
not to make you dependent on me – you have to be independent, you have
to be your own self, you have to be on your own.</p><p><br></p><p>“No matter how much your mind is trying, now it is too late.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is never too late! You can again slip into the old skin, you can
again become identified with it. And when it is REALLY too late, then
you will not ask this question. Then you will know that now there is</p><p>no possibility of going back. This will be a certainty in you. This
will be your own knowing. You will not need my certificate for it. Just
because you need a certificate, it shows it has not happened – you are
wavering.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard:</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasrudin was standing in the court. “This crime was the work of
a master criminal,” said the prosecutor, “and was carried out in a
skillful, clever manner.”</p><p><br></p><p>Blushing, Mulla Nasrudin, the defendant, rose to his feet and said,
“Sir, flattery will get you nowhere – I ain’t gonna confess.”</p><p><br></p><p>But he has confessed. Arup has confessed – this is not a question,
this is a confession – that she feels worried is natural. It is inhuman
to expect no worry, at this stage at least. Sometimes she feels
wavering; that is human, natural. It is good to accept it, rather than
deny it, rather than create a screen and hide it. “Please say this to me
so that I can stop worrying about it.”</p><p><br></p><p>How will you stop worrying about it? – just by my saying it? If it
were so easy, I would have said it to everybody. It is not so easy.
Whatsoever I say, you will interpret it in your own way, and you will
find new worries. Whatsoever I say, you will have to interpret it – you
cannot accept it totally, you cannot trust it totally. And I am not
saying that you HAVE to trust it totally; I am saying this is simply
natural. I don’t ask any unnatural thing from you. I don’t ask any
absurd things from you. It is natural! Sometimes you waver, sometimes
you are against me, sometimes you are very negative. Sometimes you feel
just to drop everything and go away back to your old world. I don’t say
that you are doing something criminal – no – it is just human. It is
very natural. If you are not doing such things, then something is wrong,
then something is amiss.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever I say will again be interpreted by the same worrying mind.
Even if I say exactly: Yes, Arup, everything is going absolutely
beautifully with you... you will think, “Was Osho joking? Does he really
mean it?” The worrying mind will jump upon it. Your interpretations are
bound to be there.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen to this small story:</p><p><br></p><p>A priest was returning home late at night from a meeting. As he drove
along, he suddenly remembered that he had not said evensong. He pulled
up at the side of a quiet country lane, got out of his car and using the
light of his car headlamps began to say the office.</p><p><br></p><p>Not long after he had begun, and much to his surprise, a lorry came
along. The driver of the lorry, thinking that something was wrong,
stopped, let down his window, and asked, “Having a spot of trouble,
mate?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, everything is alright, thank you,” replied the priest.</p><p><br></p><p>The driver put his lorry in gear and, not to be outdone as he pulled
away, cried out, “All I can say is: that must be a helluva good book you
are reading there!”</p><p><br></p><p>Now just think of somebody reading a book on a lonely lane by the
headlights of the car – what will you think? Can you imagine somebody
reading the Bible? What is the hurry to read the Bible? Can</p><p>somebody be so interested in reading the Bible? Can’t he wait and go
home and read it there? The lorry-driver must have interpreted according
to his mind – he said, “All I can say is: that must be a helluva good
book you are reading there!”</p><p><br></p><p>You continuously interpret. And you interpret, naturally, according
to your mind. What I say will not be heard; you will hear it in your own
way. If you are worrying, you will worry about it. If you are doubting,
you will doubt about it. If you are negative, you will be negative about
it. If you are trusting, you will trust.</p><p><br></p><p>Arup says, “Just say to me so that I can stop worrying about it.” No,
worrying cannot be stopped that easy. My saying it will not help you
will have to do something. You will have to do what I say. You will have
to be a little more practical. You will have to do witnessing.</p><p><br></p><p>There were three very hungry tramps, and they came to the house where
the governor was cooking rice, and he said to them that they could stay
the night and whoever had the best dream could have some hot rice.</p><p><br></p><p>So the next morning the first trampsaid, “I dreamt that I was the
king.” The second tramp said, “That’s nothing – I dreamt I was God
Himself.”</p><p>And the third tramp said, “My dream was very ordinary and I don’t
stand a chance of winning at all: I dreamt about that hot rice getting
cold, so I went down and ate it.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is what I mean by being practical. So, Arup, be practical! Do
what I say – just my saying it won’t help... and the rice is really
getting cold. You want me to help create a dream in you, and the rice is
getting cold. You just go down and eat the rice!</p><p><br></p><p>This will just give you a dream if I say: “Arup, everything is going
absolutely beautifully with you. No matter how much your mind is trying,
now it is too late. I have got you safely under my wing and there is no
way back.”</p><p><br></p><p>In the first place I cannot say it because the very desire to be safe
and secure is against spiritual growth. I am pushing you into a
dangerous realm. I am pushing you into an abyss. You would like to be
safely under my wings – now, I am throwing you into the very turmoil of
existence... with no safety, with no security. I am not a protector – I
am a destroyer. I am not your security. If you REALLY understand me, I
am going to become your dangerous life.</p><p><br></p><p>You will always be insecure if you have understood me. You will never
ask for safety and security. You will abhor safety and security. You
will think of them as enemies – they are. You will enjoy being in the
Open, vulnerable to all that is possible in life. Yes, vulnerable to
death too;‘all’ includes death too. A REAL life is encountering death
each moment. Only unreal, plastic lives are safe.</p><p><br></p><p>No, I cannot say that, that I have got you safely under my wing and
there is no way back. You can fall, you can fall from the very last
rung. Unless you become Enlightened, there is a way back; you can go
back. You can deny, you can betray, you can reject. You can fall into
the misery again – from the very last rung also you can fall. Until and
unless you have crossed the whole ladder, even the</p><p>last rung, until and unless you are just a nobody, you can fall back.
A slight ego, just a tremor of ego, is enough to bring you back. It can
again condense, it can again integrate, it can again become a new
trip.</p><p><br></p><p>And safety is not my way. To be a sannyasin means you are ready to
live life without safety. That is the greatest courage, and with that
great courage, great bliss becomes possible.</p><p><br></p><p>“And you are going to be more and more and more blissful from now
on.”</p><p><br></p><p>I am not an Emile Coue – I am not a hypnotist. Yes, you can hypnotize
yourself this way. That was the very methodology of Coue. He would tell
his patients, “Think, dream, imagine, visualize – each night before
going to sleep, each morning after the sleep, repeat again and again and
again’I am getting better, I am getting healthier, I am getting
happier<span class=s4></span>’ Repeat, go on repeating.”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, it helps a little. It creates an illusion around you. But would
you like me to help you in creating illusions? My whole approach is that
of dehypnosis; it is not of hypnosis at all. I don’t want you to be
hypnotized by any illusion. I want you to be utterly dehypnotized of all
illusions. When you are in a state of disillusionment, utter
disillusionment, Enlightenment is very close by.</p><p><br></p><p>Then Arup says, “Thank you Osho. I hope it is so<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>See! Her mind has already started interpreting.. “I HOPE it is
so<span class=s4></span>” It is not so – she simply hopes.</p><p>How you can deceive yourself!</p><p><br></p><p>“I hope it is so, but sometimes I waver.”</p><p><br></p><p>And I am not condemning your wavering – it is perfectly okay to waver
sometimes, it is perfectly human to waver sometimes. It is perfectly
right! Never condemn it! Accept it! Don’t try to create a false
unwavering – that will be of the mind and will be a deception, and will
not lead you anywhere. Let it be as it is. Accept it as it is, and
become more and more watchful, become more and more of a witness. Only
in that witnessing will you be safe. Only in that witnessing will you
become more and more blissful every day – not by repeating it! Only in
that witnessing will you stop wavering. Only in that witnessing will you
come to the center of your being – where death exists not, where only
life abundant is, where one is drinking the nectar Saraha talks
about.</p><p><br></p><p>The sixth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 7</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT IS IT EXACTLY THAT IS OBSTRUCTING MY VISION FROM SEEING THE
OBVIOUS? I JUST DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT TO DO AND WHAT NOT TO DO. WHEN
WILL I BE ABLE TO HEAR THE SOUND OF SILENCE?</p><p><br></p><p>“What is it exactly that is obstructing my vision from seeing the
obvious?”</p><p><br></p><p>THE VERY DESIRE TO SEE IT. The obvious cannot be desired. The obvious
is! You desire: you go away. You start seeking for it: in that very
moment you have made it distant, it is no more obvious, it</p><p>is no more close by; you have put it far away. How can you seek the
obvious? If you understand it is obvious, how can you seek it? It is
just there! What is the need to seek it and to desire it?</p><p><br></p><p>The obvious is the divine. The mundane is the sublime. And the
trivial is profound. In your day-to- day, ordinary activities, you are
meeting God every moment of it – because there is nobody else. You
cannot meet anybody else; it is always God in a thousand and one forms.
GOD IS VERY OBVIOUS. Only God is! But you seek, you desire... and you
miss. In your very seeking you put God very distant, far away. That is
an ego trick. Try to understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>The ego is not interested in the obvious, because the ego cannot
exist with the obvious. The ego is NOT interested at all in the
close-by. The ego is interested in the distant, faraway. Just think: man
has reached to the moon, and man has not reached to his own heart yet...
the distant. Man has invented space travel, but still he has not
developed soul travel. He has reached Everest, but he does not bother to
go into his own being. The close-by is missed and the faraway is sought.
Why?</p><p><br></p><p>The ego feels good – if the journey is hard the ego feels good. There
is something to prove. If it is difficult, there is something to prove.
To go to the moon, the ego feels good, but to go into one’s own being
will not be much of a claim.</p><p><br></p><p>There is an old story:</p><p><br></p><p>God created the world; then He used to live on the earth. You can
imagine: His troubles were too many. Everybody was complaining;
everybody was knocking at odd hours. In the night people would come and
they would say, “This is wrong, and today we need rain and it is so
hot.” And somebody would come just afterwards and he would say, “Don’t
bring rains – I am doing something and it will spoil everything.” And
God was getting almost mad: “What to do?! So many people, so many
desires, and everybody expecting and everybody needs fulfillment, and
their desires are so contradictory. The farmer wants the rain and the
potter wants no rain, because he has made pots and they will be
destroyed; he needs hot sun for a few days” – and so on and so
forth.…</p><p><br></p><p>The God called His council and asked: “What to do? – they will drive
me crazy. And I cannot satisfy them all. Or they will murder me someday!
I would like some place to hide.”</p><p><br></p><p>And they suggested many things. Somebody said, “That is not a problem
– you just go to Everest. That is the highest peak in the Himalayas;
nobody will ever reach there.”</p><p><br></p><p>God said, “You don’t know! Just after a few seconds” – for God that
is just after a few seconds – “Edmund Hillary will reach there with
Tensing, and then the trouble will start. And once they know, then they
will start coming in helicopters and buses, and everything will.<span class=s4></span>No, that won’t do. It will</p><p>solve things for a few seconds.” Remember, God’s time has a different
way. In India we say millions of years is one day of God – so a few
seconds.</p><p><br></p><p>Then somebody suggested, “And why not the moon?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That too is not very far – a few seconds more and somebody
will reach the moon.”</p><p><br></p><p>And they suggested faraway stars, but God said, “That is not going to
solve the problem. It’s simply a sort of postponement. I want a
permanent solution.”</p><p>Then an old servant of God came close, whispered something in His
ear, and God said, “You are right. That will do!”</p><p><br></p><p>And the old servant had said, “There is only one place where man will
never reach – you hide in man himself.” And that is the place where God
has been hiding since then: in man himself. That is the last thing man
will ever think.</p><p><br></p><p>The obvious is the missed, because ego is not interested. Ego is
interested in hard, difficult, arduous things, because there is a
challenge. When you win, you can claim. If the obvious is there and you
win, what sort of victory is this? You are not much of a winner. That’s
why man goes on missing the obvious and goes on seeking the distant.</p><p><br></p><p>And how can you seek the distant when you cannot even seek the
obvious? “What is it exactly that is obstructing my vision from seeing
the obvious?”</p><p>The very desire is taking you astray. Drop the desire and you will
see the obvious. “I just do not understand what to do and what not to
do.”</p><p>You are not to do anything. You have just to be watchful of all that
is happening around you. Doing is again an ego-trip. Doing, ego feels
good – something is there to do. Doing is a food for the ego; it
strengthens the ego. Non-doing, and ego falls flat on the ground. It
dies. It is no more nourished.</p><p><br></p><p>So just be a non-doer. Don’t do anything as far as God, truth, and
the search for it is concerned. It is not a search in the first place,
so you cannot do anything about it. You just be. Let me say it in
another way: if you are in a state of being, God comes to you. Man can
never find Him; He finds man. Just be in a silent space, not doing
anything, not going anywhere, not dreaming – and in that silent space
suddenly you will find He is there. He has always been there! Just you
were not silent, so you couldn’t see Him, you could not hear His still,
small voice.</p><p><br></p><p>“When will I be able to hear the sound of silence?”</p><p><br></p><p>When? – you ask a wrong question. Now or never. Hear it now! because
it is there, the music is on, the music is all over. Just you need to be
silent so that you can hear it. But never say ‘when’; ‘when’ means you
have brought future in; ‘when’ means you have started dreaming; ‘when’
means not now... and it is always now. It is always now-time. For God
there is only one time: now; and only one place: here. ‘There’, ‘then’ –
drop them.</p><p><br></p><p>And the last question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 8</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, DO YOU EVER FEEL AT A LOSS WITH WORDS?</p><p><br></p><p>THE QUESTION IS FROM RISHI. Each time I utter a word, I feel at a
loss – because that which I want to say cannot be said. And that which
has to be conveyed, cannot be conveyed. Then you will naturally ask, why
do I go on speaking?</p><p>I am trying hard. Maybe today I have failed... tomorrow. Yesterday I
failed... today. I go on speaking in different ways: maybe this way you
have not heard; in some other way maybe it will be closer to you. This
way somebody has heard; you have not heard. In another way maybe you
will be able to hear it. But I am at a loss continuously. Words don’t
come easily – because the message is wordless. I am not a priest; I am
not trying to give you some dogma; I am not trying to explain some
theory to you. Something has happened in me, something has happened to
me – I am trying to convey THAT. I am trying to commune with you.</p><p><br></p><p>Words are very awkward. They are very tiny and very small. They
cannot contain that which I want them to contain. So EACH moment I am at
a loss. People who don’t have any experience are never at a loss; any
word will do.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard a beautiful story – meditate over it:</p><p><br></p><p>A parish priest was having a few words with his Bishop, and in the
course of conversation said, “It is alright for you, my lord, when you
prepare a sermon you can deliver it to several churches in the diocese,
but I have to give two new sermons every Sunday.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Bishop replied, “You should be able to give a sermon on almost
any subject at a moment’s notice as I can.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I will take you up on that,” said the parson. “You come to my church
next Sunday and I will put you to the test.”</p><p><br></p><p>The bishop agreed and in due course went to the pulpit to find a card
with the one word ‘constipation’ written on it – that was the subject.
Without hesitation, he started: “And Moses took two tablets and went out
on to the mountainside.”</p><p><br></p><p>A priest is never at a loss. He has so many scriptures available, he
can always find something from his memory. I am continuously at a loss –
because what I want to say to you is not a subject matter: it is my
subjectivity. What I WANT to say to you is my heart! it is not my mind.
Unfortunately, I have to use the mind because there is no other way.
Even to convey the heart one has to use the mind – hence the absurdity
of it. It is very irrational. It is trying to do the impossible! But
there is no other way... I am helpless.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you ask: Am I ever at a loss for words? I am constantly. Each
single word, and I hesitate: will it do? How can it do? Knowing it is
not going to help, I go on using it. It is a necessary evil. Silence
would be better, far better, but when I LOOK at you then I hesitate. If
I become silent, it will be even more difficult for you to come closer
to me. You cannot understand the words, how will you be able to
understand the silence? And if you can understand silence, you will be
able to hear that silence in my words too.</p><p><br></p><p>If I become silent, then at the most five percent of you will be
around me. Those five percent can understand through the words too,
because they are listening to my silence not to my words. So there is no
problem for those five percent. But the other ninety-five percent who
cannot understand words and cannot understand the silence contained in
them will be simply lost. I will not be able to help them at all.
Through my words, they at least go on hanging around.</p><p>In their hanging around there is a possibility that in some unguarded
moment they may have a contact with me, some unguarded moment and in
spite of themselves they may come closer to me, they may stumble upon
me; some unguarded moment, and I may penetrate into their heart,
something may be stirred. It is a perhaps, but it is worth going on.</p><p><br></p><p>That five percent will be helped either way, but this ninety-five
percent will not be helped by silence. And that five percent also, if I
had been silent from the very beginning, would not be here. That five
percent shows the way, so that the ninety-five percent by and by will be
ninety percent, eighty-five percent, eighty percent.…</p><p><br></p><p>The day I feel at least fifty percent of people can understand
silence, then words can be dropped. I am not very happy about them.
Nobody ever was: neither was Lao Tzu, nor was Saraha, nor was Buddha –
nobody ever was. But they all had to use words, not because silence
cannot be a communion – silence can be a communion, but for that a very
higher consciousness is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Once it happened:</p><p><br></p><p>Two great mystics of India, Kabir and Farid, met, and for two days
sat silently together. The disciples were very much frustrated: they
wanted them to talk, they wanted them to talk so that they could hear
something valuable. They were hoping, for months they were hoping, that
Kabir and Farid would meet, and there would be a great showering, and
they would enjoy it. But they were just sitting silently, and the
disciples were dozing, yawning – what to do? And what happened to these
two people? – because they were never silent before. Kabir was never
silent with his disciples and neither was Farid silent with his
disciples: they were continuously hammering on their disciples. “Why?
What has happened? Have they gone dumb?” But they could not say
anything; it was not appropriate.</p><p><br></p><p>After two days, when Kabir and Farid hugged each other and said
goodbye – that too in silence – and when the disciples were left with
their Masters, they jumped upon their Masters. And the followers of
Kabir said, “What went wrong? And for months we have been waiting for
Farid to come, and he came, and you never spoke a single word. And we
were waiting and waiting... we got tired! These two days have been
hell!”</p><p><br></p><p>And Kabir laughed. He said, “But there was nothing to say – he can
understand silence. If I had said anything, he would have thought me
ignorant – because when silence is there and silence can say it, what is
the use of words?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the followers of Farid asked Farid, “What happened? Why didn’t
you speak?”</p><p><br></p><p>Farid said, “Are you mad? Speaking with Kabir? We are exactly at the
same space, so there is nothing to convey, nothing to say! The moment I
looked into his eyes and he looked into my eyes, we recognized. The
dialogue finished at the first moment!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then for two days... what were you doing for two days?”</p><p><br></p><p>And Farid said, “We were just enjoying each other – each other’s
space. We were guests to each other. We overlapped each other, we
overflowed each other, we mingled with each other – we</p><p>danced, we sang. But it all happened in silence. When silence can
speak, what is the need of language?”</p><p><br></p><p>I am continuously at a loss for words. Each word I utter very
hesitatingly, knowing well that it is not going to suffice, it is not
adequate. Nothing is ever adequate – truth is so vast and words are so
small.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

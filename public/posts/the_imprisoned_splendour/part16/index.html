It has two meanings: one is god- fearing, the other is pious, holy, virtuous.\nIn the past both these meanings have been thought to be synonymous: the god- fearing person has always been thought to be pious, and vice versa. But in my approach towards life they are diametrically opposite. If you are god-fearing, you cannot be pious; if you are pious you cannot be god-fearing. So I will accept the meaning pious and drop the meaning god-fearing.\nFear can never be pious. It does not matter what the object of fear is -- fear is fear. One should be god-loving, not god-fearing. Piousness comes out of love. If one is god-fearing deep down one will hate god. That is natural and\npsychological. We hate the person we fear, obviously. How can we love the person who creates fear in us? Fear cripples, paralyses; fear destroys. Fear reduces us to indignity; it is insulting, it is humiliating. Hence the god-fearing person is not pious, is not holy -- cannot be. He can pretend; yes, he can have a mask of piousness, but if you take off the mask you will find tremendous hatred.\nIt is because of two thousand years of conditioning that one should be afraid of god, that finally Friedrich Nietzsche asserted, 'God is dead and I declare that man is free. Now there is no need to fear.'\nIt is not Friedrich Nietzsche speaking, he is the conscience of the whole humanity. He has said something really truthful, very authentic. Of course he himself was shocked, so much so that he went mad, because his own upbringing, his own conditioning was that of a god-fearing person; he belonged to a family of priests. But it seems as if the whole collective consciousness of humanity spoke through this man. He himself was shocked, he himself went through an earthquake; he was not ready for it. He was utterly surprised at what he was saying, but he had said something. He has made the most important statement of this age. In these last hundred years no other statement has been so significant.\nBut really the cause of it is Judaism and Christianity. It is the Judeo-Christian tradition of making people afraid of god, it is man's spirit longing for freedom. And man could only be free, Nietzsche felt, if god were dead. As long as god was alive man could not be free, he had to be afraid of god. The only way to be free would be if somehow god died.\nBut Buddha and Mahavira were far more clear about the whole thing. They never said god was dead because they said god never existed in the first place. There was no question of his death -- there had been no birth. But it was Buddha's own insight, hence he was not disturbed by it. In fact nobody has been so graceful, so beautiful, so calm. And quiet, so godly, so divine as Buddha.\nNietzsche was not prepared -- he was just a philosopher. Somehow the whole unconscious of humanity erupted through him. It happens. lIe must have been a very sensitive person.\nNow psychologists say that if one person in a family goes mad that simply shows that he is the most sensitive person in the family. me whole family is driving each other crazy -- he is the most sensitive, hence he becomes the first\nvictim. And he cannot be cured unless the whole family and its way of life is changed.\nSo now from individual therapy, psychology has moved to family therapy. But that also is not going to help much, because the family is only a single unit in a community, and the whole community is driving the family mad. Maybe this family is the most sensitive; others are thick, they are not so sensitive. Unless the whole community is changed we may not be able to change this family.\nBut if one stretches this logic to its very end -- that means unless the whole humanity changes -- not even a single individual has any chance of transformation. In a way this is true because we are interlinked.\nNietzsche must have been the most sensitive person of those days, hence he became the voice of the age, he became the revolt. But his statement is significant. It ends one era, it ends one chapter of human history.\nBut the other chapter has not yet started. That's my effort here: to start another chapter, to create people who are god-loving. And when I say god-loving I mean life-loving, because to me life is god and when you love life, out of that love you start becoming pious, because love cannot be destructive. Love cannot harm, it is impossible for love to harm anybody; it can only help. It is a nourishment.\nThe loving person creates a nourishing climate around himself. He carries Spring around himself wherever he goes. People start blooming in his climate.\nSo I would like to insist that Pia means pious -- through love, pious through meditation, but not out of fear, not out of any conditioning by the priests.\nMeditation takes you beyond all conditionings, it is a process of unconditioning. And when you are completely unconditioned, all the springs of love in you start flowing.\nThat growth of love is pious. Out of that whatsoever happens is good, is right, is holy.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIt is only through meditation that nobility arises because it is only through meditation that you become graceful, that you become sensitive, that you become compassionate, that you become loving. And these are the real religious qualities.\nOne is not born noble, it is an achievement. One can be born in an aristocratic family, in a royal family that does not make anybody noble. That is a false kind of nobility, only of mannerism, of etiquette, of education. It is a formal kind of nobility; deep down you are the same ugly human being carrying all kinds of nonsense, violence, destructiveness, hatred, anger, greed, fear, lust, ego.\nNobility arises only when ego disappears and with it all the disciples anger and ambition and possessiveness and jealousy. They are all disciples of the ego. If you kill the master all the disciples are killed automatically; they can only exist with the ego. And meditation is a blow on the ego, it cuts off the head of the ego in a single blow. Hence only very courageous people can move into meditation. It is not for the cowards.\nBe courageous! And the greatest courage is to drop the ego. It is really the ultimate courage; because if you can manage that, then miracles start happening in your life. Each moment becomes so exquisitely beautiful, such a joy, such a celebration that it is impossible right now even to imagine. One knows it only when one knows it.\nIt is bliss that makes you the beloved of the whole existence. A blissful person is loved not only by people but even by animals, birds, trees, rocks. Bliss is the language that is understood by the whole existence. Once you know what bliss is you can commune with all that surrounds us, with the clouds and the stars and the moon, because they don't understand any other language. Misery they are absolutely unaware of, misery they have not known. Misery is an absolutely human phenomenon, it is man's creation, his great invention.\nTrees don't know what misery is. Yes, sometimes they know pain, but there is a great difference between pain and misery. Pain is spontaneous. If you cut a tree there is pain. But misery is not spontaneous.\nIt is playing with your past wounds, it is going into the past history of your hurts again and again. It is going into all that has been somehow agonising you in the past. It is not only thinking of the past, but thinking of the future in terms of the past, being constantly afraid of tomorrow, that it may bring some wound again, some misery.\nMisery belongs to the past and the future -- it is non-existential. Pain is a real phenomenons if you have a headache it is pain. But you had a headache twenty years before, now brooding over it is misery, or being afraid that it may come again some day is misery. Between these two miseries the small moment of the present will be crushed. And both miseries are now non -- existential. One is memory, another is imagination, one is no more, one is not yet and between the two that which is, is missed.\nYes, animals, birds, they all know pain but they don't know anything of misery, pain is something existential, misery is psychological. Because they don't know bliss miserable people cannot communicate with existence. And these are the people who go to the temples and to the mosques and to the churches, and they pray to god and they try to commune with god -- it is impossible. God cannot understand their language.\nGod only understands joy. God means this whole existence; there is no other god except this whole. God simply means the totality of existence, this organic unity of existence.\nIf you want to commune with it -- and the communion is tremendously beautiful\n-- then you have to learn the language: bliss is the language. And once you start being cheerful, singing, dancing, celebrating, once you know the festive dimension of consciousness, immediately the whole existence becomes an open secret. Then there is no need to read the Bible and the Koran and the Vedas; then they all look superficial.\nYou can read the book god himself has written. It is in the flowers, it is in the stars, it is in this rain... this sound of rain on the roof.\nMy sannyasins have to learn the language of bliss. And once you know it, you become beloved of the whole existence. Existence starts pouring; its bliss over you, so much that you cannot contain it.\nOne cannot cultivate love because a cultivated love is not love at all. And we\nhave all been told to cultivate it that's where things have gone wrong. The father says 'Love me -- I am your father. You have to love me. This is your duty.' The mother says the same. The child starts fulfilling his duty, he has to because he is helpless. He depends on these people and they are very demanding about love. Very unconsciously they are forcing the child to do something which he cannot do. If it happens it happens, if it does not happen 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nit does not happen.\nIn a more conscious world we will leave children to themselves. We will create all possible situations in which a child can love you. You can play with the child, you can run on the sea beach with the child, you can collect sea-shells with him, you can make sandcastles with him; you can create the situation in which love grows naturally, spontaneously. But never say to a child, 'Love me, you have to love me -- this is your duty,' because once he starts thinking of love as duty you have contaminated his mind, you have corrupted his natural sources, you have distracted his energy, diverted his energy. Then one day the wife says, 'Love me' the husband says 'Love me -- I am your husband' or 'I am your wife, you have to love, this is your duty.'\nEven children start saying to their parents, 'Love us! You don't love us enough.'\nEverybody is demanding and nobody understands the simple fact that if love is supplied because of your demand it is going to be false. That's why the world is full of false love. It satisfies no one, but we go on repeating the same pattern.\nMan lives so mechanically that he goes on repeating the same pattern for centuries, unless a Buddha, an awakened person tries to wake a few people, to shake a few people and say 'What are you doing? It is just stupid.' And more stupidities have been done concerning love than anything else. It has been completely killed.\nMy sannyasins have to know one thing: drop the idea of love as a duty, drop the idea that you have to love. It is not a should is not a commandment, it is not a\ndemand.\nWhen you drop all kinds of imposed nonsense about love then suddenly you will see something growing in you naturally. That will be love, and that is immensely fulfilling. But people are afraid of it, because one never knows whether it will be in support of the status quo or not, whether it will support the vested interests or not. It is unpredictable; one cannot say anything about it. Only one thing can be said: it will fulfil you, it will bring your life to a flowering, it will make your life meaningful and significant.\nAnd is everybody's life is meaningful and significant then there is no need to bother about the status quo. If it disappears, let it disappear! We don't exist for the status quo, it exists for us. We don't exist for any vested interests; if they want to exist they have to serve us. We don't exist for any nation, state, church, they are our servants. If they want to exist they have to exist for us. They are the means -- we are the end.\nThere is no need to go to any temple, any church, any mosque, because they are all false. They are substitutes created by cunning people to befool the-gullible. There is only one true temple -- that is you.\nYou have to go withinwards: when you reach your innermost core you have penetrated into the temple. And the method to find your centre is meditation. Meditation leads you to your inner shrine, You will find god there, nowhere else.\nJesus says the kingdom of god is within you he is absolutely right. You are the most sacred place, you are the Kaaba. There is nothing more sacred than your own being.\nIt happened: a Sufi mystic, Bayazid, was going on a pilgrimage to Kaaba. Kaaba is the most sacred temple of the Mohammedans. For at least twenty years he had collected money for the journey. He was a poor man. When he had enough money he went on the journey, but the next day he was back and all the money was gone.\nThe people were puzzled; they said 'What happened? Have you been robbed?' He said, No, I met a mystic just outside the town and he asked me 'Where are you going?\". I have never seen such a powerful man! The way he asked, me, the way he looked at me... I started trembling! I don't know what happened -- I had to touch his feet. He had a certain energy-field around him.\nHe said \"I know where you are going. Are you going to Kaaba!\" I said 'Yes, Sir, I am going to Kaaba.\"\nHe said, \"There is no need. What will you do in Kaaba?\" I said, \"I have to go and make seven rounds of the sacred stone\". He said \"Forget all about that. Give me the money and you can make seven rounds around me!\"\n'The way he looked.… For a moment I was shocked -- what was he saying? But his eyes were so penetrating that I had to give the money to him and I made seven rounds. He blessed me and he said \"Your journey is fulfilled. Now you go home. And whenever you want to go again, there is no need even to come to me\n-- just close your eyes and go withinwards, because the one who has commanded through me is sitting inside you too!\" And I am convinced of it,' Bayazid said to the people. 'I have found my Kaaba, I have found my temple.'\nHe never went to Kaaba again. In fact soon people started coming to him: the miracle had happened'\nWithout any formality something had transpired between that mystic and Bayazid. Bayazid never even 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nknew the name of the master. He went again to find out, but the man had disappeared.\nSufis say he was no one but Khidr. Khidr is a metaphorical figure, a spiritual guide who leads people to reality, an eternal master who always appears whenever somebody is in need. It is just an allegory, but the story is beautiful.\nThat is the meaning of your name, go withinwards, there is nowhere else to god. If you have found yourself you have found all.\nThe Imprisoned Splendor Chapter #17\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2914","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_imprisoned_splendour/part16/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_imprisoned_splendour/>The Imprisoned Splendour</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2914 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Imprisoned_Splendour/part16.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

have been a very sensitive person.</p><p>Now psychologists say that if one person in a family goes mad that
simply shows that he is the most sensitive person in the family. me
whole family is driving each other crazy -- he is the most sensitive,
hence he becomes the first</p><p>victim. And he cannot be cured unless the whole family and its way of
life is changed.</p><p>So now from individual therapy, psychology has moved to family
therapy. But that also is not going to help much, because the family is
only a single unit in a community, and the whole community is driving
the family mad. Maybe this family is the most sensitive; others are
thick, they are not so sensitive. Unless the whole community is changed
we may not be able to change <em>this</em> family.</p><p>But if one stretches this logic to its very end -- that means unless
the whole humanity changes -- not even a single individual has any
chance of transformation. In a way this is true because we are
interlinked.</p><p>Nietzsche must have been the most sensitive person of those days,
hence he became the voice of the age, he became the revolt. But his
statement is significant. It ends one era, it ends one chapter of human
history.</p><p>But the other chapter has not yet started. That's my effort here: to
start another chapter, to create people who are god-loving. And when I
say god-loving I mean life-loving, because to me life is god and when
you love life, out of that love you start becoming pious, because love
cannot be destructive. Love cannot harm, it is impossible for love to
harm anybody; it can only help. It is a nourishment.</p><p>The loving person creates a nourishing climate around himself. He
carries Spring around himself wherever he goes. People start blooming in
his climate.</p><p>So I would like to insist that Pia means pious -- through love, pious
through meditation, but not out of fear, not out of any conditioning by
the priests.</p><p>Meditation takes you beyond all conditionings, it is a process of
unconditioning. And when you are completely unconditioned, all the
springs of love in you start flowing.</p><p>That growth of love is pious. Out of that whatsoever happens is good,
is right, is holy.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

through meditation that you become graceful, that you become sensitive,
that you become compassionate, that you become loving. And these are the
real religious qualities.</p><p>One is not born noble, it is an achievement. One can be born in an
aristocratic family, in a royal family that does not make anybody noble.
That is a false kind of nobility, only of mannerism, of etiquette, of
education. It is a formal kind of nobility; deep down you are the same
ugly human being carrying all kinds of nonsense, violence,
destructiveness, hatred, anger, greed, fear, lust, ego.</p><p>Nobility arises only when ego disappears and with it <em>all</em> the
disciples anger and ambition and possessiveness and jealousy. They are
all disciples of the ego. If you kill the master all the disciples are
killed automatically; they can only exist with the ego. And meditation
is a blow on the ego, it cuts off the head of the ego in a single blow.
Hence only very courageous people can move into meditation. It is not
for the cowards.</p><p>Be courageous! And the greatest courage is to drop the ego. It is
really the ultimate courage; because if you can manage that, then
miracles start happening in your life. Each moment becomes so
exquisitely beautiful, such a joy, such a celebration that it is
impossible right now even to imagine. One knows it only when one knows
it.</p><p>It is bliss that makes you the beloved of the whole existence. A
blissful person is loved not only by people but even by animals, birds,
trees, rocks. Bliss is the language that is understood by the whole
existence. Once you know what bliss is you can commune with all that
surrounds us, with the clouds and the stars and the moon, because they
don't understand any other language. Misery they are absolutely unaware
of, misery they have not known. Misery is an absolutely human
phenomenon, it is man's creation, his great invention.</p><p>Trees don't know what misery is. Yes, sometimes they know pain, but
there is a great difference between pain and misery. Pain is
spontaneous. If you cut a tree there is pain. But misery is not
spontaneous.</p><p>It is playing with your past wounds, it is going into the past
history of your hurts again and again. It is going into all that has
been somehow agonising you in the past. It is not only thinking of the
past, but thinking of the future in terms of the past, being constantly
afraid of tomorrow, that it may bring some wound again, some misery.</p><p>Misery belongs to the past and the future -- it is non-existential.
Pain is a <em>real</em> phenomenons if you have a headache it is pain.
But you had a headache twenty years before, now brooding over it is
misery, or being afraid that it may come again some day is misery.
Between these two miseries the small moment of the present will be
crushed. And both miseries are now non -- existential. One is memory,
another is imagination, one is no more, one is not yet and between the
two that which is, is missed.</p><p>Yes, animals, birds, they all know pain but they don't know anything
of misery, pain is something existential, misery is psychological.
Because they don't know bliss miserable people cannot communicate with
existence. And these are the people who go to the temples and to the
mosques and to the churches, and they pray to god and they try to
commune with god -- it is impossible. God cannot understand their
language.</p><p>God only understands joy. God means this whole existence; there is no
other god except this whole. God simply means the totality of existence,
this organic unity of existence.</p><p>If you want to commune with it -- and the communion is tremendously
beautiful</p><p>-- then you have to learn the language: bliss is the language. And
once you start being cheerful, singing, dancing, celebrating, once you
know the festive dimension of consciousness, immediately the whole
existence becomes an open secret. Then there is no need to read the
Bible and the Koran and the Vedas; then they all look superficial.</p><p>You can read the book god himself has written. It is in the flowers,
it is in the stars, it is in this rain... this sound of rain on the
roof.</p><p>My sannyasins have to learn the language of bliss. And once you know
it, you become beloved of the whole existence. Existence starts pouring;
its bliss over you, so much that you cannot contain it.</p><p>One cannot cultivate love because a cultivated love is not love at
all. And we</p><p>have all been told to cultivate it that's where things have gone
wrong. The father says 'Love me -- I am your father. You <em>have</em>
to love me. This is your duty.' The mother says the same. The child
starts fulfilling his duty, he has to because he is helpless. He depends
on these people and they are very demanding about love. Very
unconsciously they are forcing the child to do something which he cannot
do. If it happens it happens, if it does not happen 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>it does not happen.</p><p>In a more conscious world we will leave children to themselves. We
will create all possible situations in which a child <em>can</em> love
you. You can play with the child, you can run on the sea beach with the
child, you can collect sea-shells with him, you can make sandcastles
with him; you can create the situation in which love grows naturally,
spontaneously. But never say to a child, 'Love me, you have to love me
-- this is your duty,' because once he starts thinking of love as duty
you have contaminated his mind, you have corrupted his natural sources,
you have distracted his energy, diverted his energy. Then one day the
wife says, 'Love me' the husband says 'Love me -- I am your husband' or
'I am your wife, you have to love, this is your duty.'</p><p>Even children start saying to their parents, 'Love us! You don't love
us enough.'</p><p>Everybody is demanding and nobody understands the simple fact that if
love is supplied because of your demand it is going to be false. That's
why the world is full of false love. It satisfies no one, but we go on
repeating the same pattern.</p><p>Man lives so mechanically that he goes on repeating the same pattern
for centuries, unless a Buddha, an awakened person tries to wake a few
people, to shake a few people and say 'What are you doing? It is just
stupid.' And more stupidities have been done concerning love than
anything else. It has been completely killed.</p><p>My sannyasins have to know one thing: drop the idea of love as a
duty, drop the idea that you <em>have</em> to love. It is not a should
is not a commandment, it is not a</p><p>demand.</p><p>When you drop all kinds of imposed nonsense about love then suddenly
you will see something growing in you naturally. That will be love, and
that is immensely fulfilling. But people are afraid of it, because one
never knows whether it will be in support of the status quo or not,
whether it will support the vested interests or not. It is
unpredictable; one cannot say anything about it. Only one thing can be
said: it will fulfil you, it will bring your life to a flowering, it
will make your life meaningful and significant.</p><p>And is everybody's life is meaningful and significant then there is
no need to bother about the status quo. If it disappears, let it
disappear! We don't exist for the status quo, it exists for us. We don't
exist for any vested interests; if they want to exist they have to serve
us. We don't exist for any nation, state, church, they are our servants.
If they want to exist they have to exist for us. They are the means --
we are the end.</p><p>There is no need to go to any temple, any church, any mosque, because
they are all false. They are substitutes created by cunning people to
befool the-gullible. There is only one true temple -- that is you.</p><p>You have to go withinwards: when you reach your innermost core you
have penetrated into the temple. And the method to find your centre is
meditation. Meditation leads you to your inner shrine, You will find god
there, nowhere else.</p><p>Jesus says the kingdom of god is within you he is absolutely right.
You are the most sacred place, you are the Kaaba. There is nothing more
sacred than your own being.</p><p>It happened: a Sufi mystic, Bayazid, was going on a pilgrimage to
Kaaba. Kaaba is the most sacred temple of the Mohammedans. For at least
twenty years he had collected money for the journey. He was a poor man.
When he had enough money he went on the journey, but the next day he was
back and all the money was gone.</p><p>The people were puzzled; they said 'What happened? Have you been
robbed?' He said, No, I met a mystic just outside the town and he asked
me 'Where are you going?". I have never seen such a powerful man! The
way he asked, me, the way he looked at me... I started trembling! I
don't know what happened -- I had to touch his feet. He had a certain
energy-field around him.</p><p>He said "I know where you are going. Are you going to Kaaba!" I said
'Yes, Sir, I am going to Kaaba."</p><p>He said, "There is no need. What will you do in Kaaba?" I said, "I
have to go and make seven rounds of the sacred stone". He said "Forget
all about that. Give me the money and you can make seven rounds around
me!"</p><p>'The way he looked.… For a moment I was shocked -- what was he
saying? But his eyes were so penetrating that I had to give the money to
him and I made seven rounds. He blessed me and he said "Your journey is
fulfilled. Now you go home. And whenever you want to go again, there is
no need even to come to me</p><p>-- just close your eyes and go withinwards, because the one who has
commanded through me is sitting inside you too!" And I am convinced of
it,' Bayazid said to the people. 'I have found my Kaaba, I have found my
temple.'</p><p>He never went to Kaaba again. In fact soon people started coming to
him: the miracle had happened'</p><p>Without any formality something had transpired between that mystic
and Bayazid. Bayazid never even 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

had disappeared.</p><p>Sufis say he was no one but Khidr. Khidr is a metaphorical figure, a
spiritual guide who leads people to reality, an eternal master who
always appears whenever somebody is in need. It is just an allegory, but
the story is beautiful.</p><p>That is the meaning of your name, go withinwards, there is nowhere

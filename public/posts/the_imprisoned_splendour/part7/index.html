It is for reference purposes only.]\nBliss is a by-product of being consecrated to god. One cannot achieve it directly\n-- the way to bliss is via god. One has to surrender to god. In that very surrender bliss happens.\nMisery is separation from god, bliss is reunion. And by god I don't mean some person; by god I simply mean the whole, the existence, all that is.\nMan lives in isolation. He tries to create a subtle wall around himself so that he can feel that he is somebody special. That wall, that subtle invisible wall is what is called the ego, and it is the root cause of misery.\nIt is as if a tree is trying to separate itself from the earth, from the sky, from the\nsun, from the air, from the stars, from the moon -- from everything that surrounds it. The tree will start dying because it has to be nourished by the earth, it has to remain rooted in the earth, it has to be nourished by the sun rays, It has to understand that it is not separate and it cannot be separate, that it is absolutely intrinsically part of the organic unity of existence.\nBut no tree is as foolish as man is, no animal either is as foolish as man is. Man is the only idiotic animal on the earth, but that idiocy can also be transformed into a great blessing, because only man can understand what is separation and what is union.\nThe trees, the birds, the animals, are one with existence -- but unaware. They are blissful but they have no idea of what bliss is, they are not conscious of it. And a bliss which is unconscious is not of much value.\nYou may have a treasure, but if you are not aware of it what is the point of having it?\nThis distant call of the cuckoo is beautiful to us, but not to the cuckoo itself. The cuckoo has no idea of what beauty is, what music is, what poetry is. It is unaware -- blissful, but unaware.\nMan is not aware but miserable. But this misery can be dropped. Awareness has to be increased a little more and man has to drop it consciously and has to achieve a reunion -- I call it a reunion. The tree and the cuckoo and the other birds and the animals are in a state of union. Man has to reclaim it; he has lost contact with it.\nOnly man can be a Buddha or a Christ. Hence that foolishness is not just a curse, it can also be a blessing. It all depends on us, on what we do about our misery. We can go on nursing it and we can go on creating more hell for ourselves. We can drop it and can move towards the whole for the ultimate merger.\nWe can melt ourselves into the ocean of existence. And then bliss arises. And when man becomes blissful, his bliss has tremendous value. The cuckoo is blissful but its bliss has no value.\nTo be consecrated to god means to be ready to merge and melt into the whole -- then bliss comes of its own accord.\nSannyas is an offering to god out of love, not out of fear, The so-called religious person is religious because he is afraid. His whole religiousness is rooted in fear, is oriented in fear; hence his religiousness is not true, authentic religiousness, it is pseudo, He creates the idea of god out of fear, He believes in god, he knows nothing of god. Only ignorant people believe, the knowing ones need not believe because they know.\nIf you know, there is no need to believe or disbelieve. If you don't know then the question arises of whether to believe or not to believe, So ignorant people are divided into two camps: the believers and the disbelievers. But both are ignorant, They may be Catholics or communists, it makes no difference. The knowers simply know they have experienced, they have tasted, But that needs a totally different kind of orientation.\nYour religion has to be not out of fear, but out of love. Don't be afraid of hell -- there is no hell, there never has been. It is a fiction created by the priests to exploit humanity, and they have exploited humanity for centuries. And there is no heaven either. It is the other side of hell; the other side of the fiction, That is to exploit your greed,\nGreed and fear are not different phenomena but two sides of the same coin; the fearful person is always greedy, the greedy person is always fearful. In fact they are not two energies at all but two poles of the same energy. Just like negative and positive poles of electricity, inseparably together. There is no heaven either.\nYes, there is a certain kind of hell and heaven, but that is psychological, within you. It has nothing to do with my place somewhere, below the earth or above, in the sky. It is not geographical.\nDrop the whole idea of heaven and hell -- religion has nothing to do with all that nonsense. Drop the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nidea of god as a person. To call god the father is simply to provoke your fear, because each child has been afraid of the father from the very beginning. And\nthat fear remains for your whole life. Even if you go through years of primal therapy, it remains and lingers somewhere, it becomes so ingrained that it goes to your bones, to your very marrow. To call god 'the father' is simply to create a childish fear in you and a childish dependence in you.\nThere is no god as a person and there is no super-father in heaven. God simply means the whole existence, it is another name for life.\nLove life, be devoted to life, live life as totally as possible. That's what I mean by offering. offer yourself to life totally without holding anything back and then great bliss arises, a bliss that has a beginning but not end.\nThe only revolution worth calling revolution happens through meditation. The political revolutions are not revolutions but at the most, reforms, and in fact almost useless reforms because the man remains the same, you only change the structure. If you change the structure and the man remains the same, nothing in fact changes. Even in the new structure he will behave in the old ways, in the same old ways.\nFor example, in Russia, the revolution, the political revolution happened. The Capitalists disappeared and the old division of the poor and the rich disappeared. A new division has arisen, the people who are in power and the people who are not in power. It is the same game. Now to be a member of the Communist party is to be powerful, and to be in the government is to be rich, far richer than the old kind of capitalists.\nThey were not as powerful and not so rich either. In fact no czar in Russia has been as powerful as Josef Stalin. The structure has changed, but because the mind is the same the mind creates its old games again.\nIt is as if we take a whole load of people to the moon: everything will be different. The scenery will be different, there will be no trees, no mountains, no rivers. But these people will continue to do the same things on the moon. The husband and the wife will go on fighting in the same old way. It will not make any difference that they are on the moon, that now it is not right to fight in the old ways. The thief will remain a thief there. He will go on stealing things from people. Everything will continue in the same way, although everything on the outside is different.\nIt is only through meditation that your inner world changes because meditation\nmeans going beyond the mind, getting rid of the mind. And mind contains all the games and the numbers and the trips. Once the mind is dropped, you have a totally new perspective, a new vision, a new way of seeing and being. That's what sannyas is all about: it is a revolution through meditation.\nThe whole art of being blissful is the art of remaining relaxed, relaxed in all kinds of activities of life. I am not teaching my people to renounce life but I am certainly teaching them to renounce tensions, tense states of mind. Go on doing the same thing that you have been doing but now do it relaxedly. Action is not important, how you do it is important.\nIn the old days, for centuries the idea has persisted, has been very dominant, that you have to drop out of the world, that you have to leave the world and move into a monastery or into the Himalayas and go to Tibet\n-- only then can you realise god. That is sheer stupidity, That is not the way to realise god, because god is as much here in the marketplace as he is in the mountains. If you cannot find him here you will not find him in the mountains either.\nSo the real thing is to live in a relaxed way, to act relaxedly. Go on doing the same things but with a new quality. with a new grace, a new beauty, a new silence, a new meditativeness, new awareness and with no tensions in the mind. Don't be an achiever, don't be ambitious. Just live in the moment, and live in the moment as if this is the first and the last moment. So live totally, intensely. yet relaxed, utterly relaxed. And then bliss will follow you like a shadow.\nAll my meditations here are to help you in some way or other to become more and more relaxed.\nRelaxation is the key, the golden key that opens the door to god.\nGod is the full-stop. There is nothing higher than that. God is the ultimate goal. If a person makes god only one of the items on his shopping list he will never be able to taste that experience. God has to be your only goal, all other items or your shopping list have to disappear. Then all your desires become one deep intense longing for god. Then it happens instantly.\nWe are divided because of our desires. One desire is pulling you towards the north, the other is pulling you towards the south. There are thousands of\nfragments. They have created a crowd in you, they don't allow you to be a single individual. They are very noisy and they are continuously fighting with each other, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ntrying to dominate; each desire wants to dominate. There is a constant civil war.\nMillions of people become interested in god but that is only one of their interests, that's why they miss.\nGod has to be the only interest, then you cannot miss. And god contains all: it contains bliss, it contains peace, it contains truth, it contains consciousness, it contains love, it contains compassion. It contains all that is worth having, so there is no need for any other desire. It covers all that is beautiful and valuable, and all that is left out is worthless.\nThat is the meaning of your name, Deva Viramo -- let it become the meaning of your life too. And now the time has come for you to make a concentrated effort to put all your desires into one stream, not into many events, otherwise energy gets dissipated. Just pour yourself into one prayer. Let your whole being become just one thirst, one longing; the longing for god. And whenever it is total, it is immediately fulfilled, not even a single moment is lost. If you have to wait that simply means your longing is still divided.\nSo whatsoever you are doing, now make it a point that it is all a means towards god. Eating, walking, sleeping -- whatsoever you are doing, all the arrows have to point towards god. Not even a single fragment of your being should be pointing towards something else. And the day it happens, the moment it happens\n--\nthat your total being is athirst, afire -- that very moment... the miracle.\nYes, it can only be called the miracle. It transforms you. It takes you from time to eternity. It takes you beyond the body and the mind to your ultimate home. Then there is no coming back. One is dissolved into the universal -- and that is\nour real home.\nThe Imprisoned Splendor Chapter #8\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2222","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_imprisoned_splendour/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_imprisoned_splendour/>The Imprisoned Splendour</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2222 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Imprisoned_Splendour/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

same things on the moon. The husband and the wife will go on fighting in
the same old way. It will not make any difference that they are on the
moon, that now it is not right to fight in the old ways. The thief will
remain a thief there. He will go on stealing things from people.
Everything will continue in the same way, although everything on the
outside is different.</p><p>It is only through meditation that your inner world changes because
meditation</p><p>means going beyond the mind, getting rid of the mind. And mind
contains all the games and the numbers and the trips. Once the mind is
dropped, you have a totally new perspective, a new vision, a new way of
seeing and being. That's what sannyas is all about: it is a revolution
through meditation.</p><p>The whole art of being blissful is the art of remaining relaxed,
relaxed in all kinds of activities of life. I am not teaching my people
to renounce life but I am certainly teaching them to renounce tensions,
tense states of mind. Go on doing the same thing that you have been
doing but now do it relaxedly. Action is not important, how you do it is
important.</p><p>In the old days, for centuries the idea has persisted, has been very
dominant, that you have to drop out of the world, that you have to leave
the world and move into a monastery or into the Himalayas and go to
Tibet</p><p>-- only then can you realise god. That is sheer stupidity, That is
not the way to realise god, because god is as much here in the
marketplace as he is in the mountains. If you cannot find him here you
will not find him in the mountains either.</p><p>So the real thing is to live in a relaxed way, to act relaxedly. Go
on doing the same things but with a new quality. with a new grace, a new
beauty, a new silence, a new meditativeness, new awareness and with no
tensions in the mind. Don't be an achiever, don't be ambitious. Just
live in the moment, and live in the moment as if this is the first and
the last moment. So live totally, intensely. yet relaxed, utterly
relaxed. And then bliss will follow you like a shadow.</p><p>All my meditations here are to help you in some way or other to
become more and more relaxed.</p><p>Relaxation is the key, the golden key that opens the door to god.</p><p>God is the full-stop. There is nothing higher than that. God is the
ultimate goal. If a person makes god only one of the items on his
shopping list he will never be able to taste that experience. God has to
be your only goal, all other items or your shopping list have to
disappear. Then all your desires become one deep intense longing for
god. Then it happens instantly.</p><p>We are divided because of our desires. One desire is pulling you
towards the north, the other is pulling you towards the south. There are
thousands of</p><p>fragments. They have created a crowd in you, they don't allow you to
be a single individual. They are very noisy and they are continuously
fighting with each other, 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>trying to dominate; each desire wants to dominate. There is a
constant civil war.</p><p>Millions of people become interested in god but that is only one of
their interests, that's why they miss.</p><p>God has to be the only interest, then you cannot miss. And god
contains all: it contains bliss, it contains peace, it contains truth,
it contains consciousness, it contains love, it contains compassion. It
contains all that is worth having, so there is no need for any other
desire. It covers all that is beautiful and valuable, and all that is
left out is worthless.</p><p>That is the meaning of your name, Deva Viramo -- let it become the
meaning of your life too. And now the time has come for you to make a
concentrated effort to put all your desires into one stream, not into
many events, otherwise energy gets dissipated. Just pour yourself into
one prayer. Let your whole being become just one thirst, one longing;
the longing for god. And whenever it is total, it is immediately
fulfilled, not even a single moment is lost. If you have to wait that
simply means your longing is still divided.</p><p>So whatsoever you are doing, now make it a point that it is all a
means towards god. Eating, walking, sleeping -- whatsoever you are
doing, all the arrows have to point towards god. Not even a single
fragment of your being should be pointing towards something else. And
the day it happens, the moment it happens</p><p>--</p><p>that your total being is athirst, afire -- that very moment... the
miracle.</p><p>Yes, it can only be called the miracle. It transforms you. It takes
you from time to eternity. It takes you beyond the body and the mind to
your ultimate home. Then there is no coming back. One is dissolved into
the universal -- and that is</p><p>our real home.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-imprisoned-splendor>The Imprisoned Splendor</h3><p>Chapter #8</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

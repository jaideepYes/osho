It is for reference purposes only.]\nDivine rejoicing is precisely the definition of my sannyas.\nMisery is evil, joy is divine. To be miserable is the greatest sin in the world because the miserable person creates misery for others. He cannot help it, he is bound to create misery. The blissful person creates bliss, spontaneously, effortlessly. Wherever he moves a paradise moves with him, wherever he is there is paradise.\nThe whole art of religion is the shifting of consciousness from misery to bliss. Both are our possibilities.\nThey don't come from the outside. Misery simply means our energies are upside-\ndown, they are not in harmony. Bliss means our energies are functioning in harmony, humming in harmony, attuned to each other.\nOnce our energies are in harmony within, suddenly you find that you are in harmony with the whole too: the inner harmony brings you to the outer harmony. when there is music inside, you fall in tune with the universe, with tao, then you are part of this organic unity.\nIn misery ego exists, in bliss ego disappears. Being my sannyasin simply means rejoicing.\nMisery is dark, it is gloomy. It is a dark night with no moon, with no stars, not even a candlelight; it is utter darkness. That's where millions of people are living and they have accepted it as if this is the only way life is supposed to be. They are born not for this life, they bring a great potential for light, but they never make that potential actual, they never go through a transformation. They remain seeds. They contain flowers, they contain great perfume. But if you dissect the seed you will not find the flowers or the perfume.\nThe seed has to find the right soil, the right gardener, water, sun, the right climate. When everything is helping the seed, creating a confidence in the seed so that it can allow a let-go, it can disappear in the soil, then the potential starts becoming actual.\nBliss is light. That's why another name for bliss is delight -- it is delight. But one has to go through a great radical change; one has to learn how to die like the seed dies into the soil. And that's what sannyas is all about: a death, and then the resurrection follows.\nThe master is only a gardener; he can only help you. All that will happen will happen within you. It is yours, it has always been yours -- nobody can give it to you. And the filed, the energy field of the master is the right soil. If one can disappear into it, if one can become anonymous, a nobody in it, then miracles start happening. All darkness disappears and the whole being becomes full of light. Then there is no death.\nOnce you have learned how to die as far as the ego is concerned, then there is no death. Then you are eternal, then you are part of eternity.\nOnly a man of peace can attain to bliss. Peace is the foundation. Without peace\nthere is no possibility for bliss. Peace prepares you to receive bliss. Bliss cannot happen in a disturbed state. It needs a calm and quiet and still being; hence the importance of meditation.\nMeditation does not create bliss, it only creates a peaceful state, a tranquil state. But once that tranquility is there, bliss starts descending of its own accord. When you are ready then not even a single moment is missed, there is no delay; the universal law functions immediately. But we have to show our preparation, we have to show that we are ready.\nExistence is very fair, very just. It never gives bliss to anybody who does not deserve it and it never delays bliss for anybody who deserves it, not even by a split second.\nMy path is the path of bliss. It is not to be confused with the so-called religions.\nThe so-called religions are all rooted in a sad attitude. Their approach towards life is very serious. they 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ndon't take it as fun, they don't take it as a cosmic joke; they are very serious about it -- and that seriousness becomes a cancer in the soul. Life becomes a burden because for centuries these so-called religions have been teaching people how to renounce life, not how to live it. They have not taught the art of loving; their whole concern is how to commit slow suicide. and your so-called saints are nothing but suicidal people. to me they are all pathological, ill, they are not healthy and whole. They are lopsided; their vision is not clear.\nAnd they are not really religious.\nA really religious person will say yes to life joyously, dancingly. His whole being will be a celebration.\nHe will not act out of fear, he will act out of love. He will not be worried about hell and heaven, he will not be worried at all. He will live moment-to-moment,\nbut he will live each moment with utter totality. and that total living brings bliss, that total living is the path of bliss.\nI don't teach that you have to live some other kind of life, some monastic life. I teach: live the ordinary life but live it with extraordinary awareness and love, with extraordinary totality, intensity, passion. And then you will find something growing in you each moment. Slowly slowly you will see clearly that a peak is arising in you. When that peak comes to a culmination you realise what life is all about, the meaning of it, the purpose of it. You can call it god, you can call it tao\n-- any name will do. In fact it is a nameless experience, but tremendously ecstatic.\nLove is the only experience in life which defies death, which transcends death, which gives you a glimpse of immortality; it opens a door into eternity.\nLove is the basic religious experience. It is the most sacred phenomenon on earth. All true spirituality has arisen out of the experience of love. Of course it only opens the window, and that too, only for a moment, but once you have seen the vast sky, the splendor of that moment, then you can never remain confined in small, mundane concerns. You will start finding more and more ways to jump out of all confinement. You will start finding the door.\nWithout love one never becomes aware of the beyond. And unless one is aware of the beyond why should one seek and search for it? The question, the very question does not arise. One simply lives in a prison cell believing that this is all there is to life, there is no more to it, because one has no consciousness of anything beyond the four walls of the prison.\nLove is the key, the magic that uplifts you and gives you an opportunity to see the sky full of stars, the flowers, the trees, the wind, the sun, the moon. And suddenly a great longing arises in you to transcend those limits, to go beyond the four walls of the prison.\nIt is this longing that has brought you here; it is this longing that has made you take the jump into sannyas.\nReligion is nothing but the science of love. it has nothing to do with Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Mohammedanism. Its whole concern is with love, and only with love. And love cannot be Christian or Hindu or Mohammedan or Christian, neither can you.\nTrees are trees; the sun is not Christian, the moon is not Hindu. Existence knows nothing of all this nonsense. It is only the stupidity of man that goes on dividing; and all divisions create conflict, fight, continuous chaos. Man has lived in this chaos for centuries, but because the chaos has beautiful names --\nChristianity, Hinduism, Mohammedanism -- because of these beautiful names one is deceived, one is utterly deceived. Once we take those labels away you can see the reality; it is naked violence, hatred, masquerading as love.\nLove cannot divide, love unites. Love is the only way of becoming one -- not only with humanity but with all life as such and ultimately with all existence as such. And when you start feeling one with the whole, how can misery exist, how can anxiety or worry exist?\nAll these things become possible because we feel ourselves as separate from the whole. It is the separation from the whole that creates hell, it is union with the whole that creates paradise. And love is the bridge!\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe Imprisoned Splendor Chapter #21\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1533","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_imprisoned_splendour/part20/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_imprisoned_splendour/>The Imprisoned Splendour</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1533 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Imprisoned_Splendour/part20.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

It is for reference purposes only.]\nLove is the most healing force in the world, nothing goes deeper than love. It heals not only the body, not only the mind, but also the soul. If one can love then all one's wounds disappear. Then one becomes whole -- and to be whole is to be holy.\nUnless one is whole one is not holy. The physical health is a superficial phenomenon. It can happen through medicine, it can happen through science. But the innermost core of one's being can be healed only through love. Those who know the secret of love know the greatest secret of life. Then there is no misery for them, no old age, no death. Of course the body will become old and the body will die but love reveals to you the truth that you are not the body. you are pure consciousness, you have no birth, no death. And to live in that pure consciousness is to live in tune with god. Bliss is a by-product of living in tune with god.\nMove deeper into the phenomenon of love, in the mystery of love.\nOrdinarily people are afraid of love for the simple reason that they cannot fulfil the basic requirement.\nThe basic requirement becomes a great hindrance for them. The basic requirement is dropping of the ego .\nAnd that's what sannyas is all about: it is surrendering the ego.\nThe moment you surrender the ego, love starts growing in you because the hindrance is removed. You start becoming more and more loving, and ultimately one becomes love itself. Then all bliss and all truth is yours.\nDance is one of the deepest meditations possible, for the simple reason that when dance reaches to its climax the dancer disappears. There is only dance -- there is nobody dancing. If the dancer remains then the peak has not yet been achieved, the moment you achieve the peak you are no more there -- that's the paradox of dance. Hence dance has been used for centuries in the secret ceremonies of all mystery schools.\nSufis have developed it almost into a science, because if one goes on dancing, at a certain moment the body is transcended. But the mind remains. If one still goes on dancing, at a certain other moment the mind is transcended. But the idea of 'I am' the soul as a separate entity, still persists. If one continues to dance, at a certain moment even the soul is transcended. Then all identities of the ego are dissolved. The dance is there and for the first time it is perfect, it is total.\nIn those moments one catches a glimpse for the first time that existence is full of god, that god is not a person but a quality. It is like a fragrance that surrounds the whole existence. But it happens only when you disappear.\nIt is said that Jalaluddin Rumi, one of the greatest Sufi mystics, became enlightened after thirty-six hours of continuous dancing; he danced and danced and danced. He forgot everything. People thought he had gone mad. He was not even conscious of the passage of time. The day turned into night, the night turned into day, again the day turned into night. Thirty-six hours... and then a moment came, the doors opened.\nSuddenly he was transported to another realm and another dimension of being.\nThat's how the whirling dervishes were born. Jalaluddin Rumi is the founder of the school. They still go on dancing, but now it is simply a ritual. That's one of the greatest misfortunes that always happens.\nBuddha became enlightened after seven days sitting silently, doing nothing, not moving at all. It is just 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthe other pole of dancing -- dancing means movement. Hence Sufism is one pole and Zen another. They are diametrically opposite but leading to the same point. After seven days of continuous sitting he also forgot about time, the passage of time, and then he evaporated, Now Buddhist monks till go on sitting, but now it is a ritual. They go on looking at the time. And that is the basic requirement -- that you should forget time because time means mind.\nOnce a Buddhist monk, bhikshu Jagdish Kashyap, a very famous Buddhist, came to see me and he said that now he would have to leave because it was time for his meditation. I said, 'Time? Has time anything to do with meditation?' He said, 'Yes, every day I meditate for one hour.' I asked him, 'How do you manage to know that the one hour has passed?' He said, 'I have to look at the watch two or three times.' said, 'You are simply befooling yourself. For seven days Buddha was not even aware of when the sun rose, when the sun set, when it was day and it was night. He became completely oblivious of everything, then he attained. You are simply waiting your time. Do something else; if you want to be so attached to time, then better you do something else.'\nMeditation has nothing to do with time. You cannot meditate for a time being; it has to become a quality that spreads all over your life. Otherwise everything, becomes a ritual.\nMy message to my sannyasins is: let dance be your very quality of life, or let silence, inactivity, be your very quality of life. Even walking you are still, calm and quiet.\nThere are two types of people: one who will reach through action, and one who will reach through inaction. As I see it, it will be the right process for you to move through the door of dance, action, movement, creativity. You will find it easier, in tune with your being. But it has to become your life, and then one day it happens. Without any notification, without any message to you that it is going\nto happen now, it suddenly happens. You are taken aback, you are in for a surprise when it happens. It always happens like a miracle.\nBliss brings many songs to your being, it brings much celebration. Just as spring brings many flowers to the trees, bliss brings many songs to you. And when they come out of bliss they have a certain quality which can only be described as sacred. It is not of this world, it belongs to the beyond. It is something unearthly.\nIf bliss does not bring many songs to your being then your bliss is imaginary. Then you have imagined that the spring has come but the proof will be the trees, the proof will be the songs that will start arising in your heart. Great poetry explodes... it is a poetic explosion - even for people who are very unpoetic, who have never thought of poetry.\nMohammed was never a poet and he had never thought of poetry, but when it happened, he burst out singing. That's how the Koran was born, and it contains some of the most beautiful poems. He was uneducated, hence the Koran does not have the flavor of a cultured treatise, it is not a book written by a scholar. He was not even a poet in the ordinary sense; hence it has not followed any rules of poetry - any rhythm, any meter - but still, there is nothing comparable to it. It carries something of his bliss. Those words are transmuted. They have passed through his heart, they still beat with his heartbeat.\nOne should not read the Koran, one should only listen to it, recite it. It is not language, it is not grammar; it is not philosophy, it is not theology. If one looks for theology it is a very poor thing. If one looks for philosophy it looks very ordinary. But if one simply listens to the Koran recited, one can be overwhelmed. Without understanding a single word of the Arabic, it will touch and move your heart because then it will penetrate as pure music.\nThis has to be the criterion: if bliss really happens it is bound to bring many songs to you.\nYour so-called saints look so sad that I cannot believe that they have experienced God; they must have imagined it. They are not dancing, they are not singing, they are not celebrating. They look almost dead, dull; they don't have any joy. They don't seem to have any life; they seem to live a posthumous type of existence. They look ghostly. Maybe the holy ghost has visited them, but not God. And the holy ghost does not seem to be very holy either! Ghosts are not\nknown to be holy; they are unholy people. One should keep oneself out of their way.\nYour saints look ghostly, dead, utterly dead. They cannot laugh, they cannot love, they cannot dance, they cannot sing. What kind of religion is that? And this has happened all over the world. It has happened to Christian saints, it has happened to Hindu saints, it has happened to Buddhist saints. It seems to be something almost universal. But Buddha was not like that, neither was Jesus like that, nor was Mohammed like that.\nThe really religious people were full of juice, full of tremendous life. They were really alive. The 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nordinary people are not alive compared to them.\nSo remember this is a criterion: meditation succeeds only if it brings bliss. And bliss is true only if great celebration explodes in you that goes on and on, that knows no end. It knows only the beginning.\nSannyas is the art of divine acting. You have to live in the world but you have to think of the world only as a big drama. I am against renouncing the world. You have not to escape from the world, you have to live in it, but in a totally different way. Don't take it seriously, take it very light-heartedly, take it as a cosmic joke. It is a cosmic joke. In the East we call it god's play. If it is god's play then we are just actors in it, and nobody takes acting seriously.\nYou can be a king in a drama, but you don't take it seriously. As the curtain falls you forget all about your being a king; it does not go to your head. That's how a sannyasin has to take the whole of life. If you are rich, don't let it go to your head, or if you are poor, don't take it seriously. We are all playing roles: play them as beautifully as possible but continuously remember, that it is all a game. And when death comes the final curtain drops. Then all actors disappear. They all disappear into one universal energy.\nIf one can live in the world remembering this, one is totally freed from all misery. Misery is a by-product of taking things seriously and bliss is a by- product of taking things lightly. Take life as fun; rejoice in it.\nBliss is the god of gods. The real search of every being is bliss. Sannyas is not interested in god directly because that creates unnecessary complexities. There are believers and there are non-believers -- and even the believers differ. There are three hundred religions on the earth and almost three thousand sects within those religions. That means there are three thousand concepts about god. If one wants to enquire into god one gets into an unnecessary puzzle and one cannot sort it out. It is impossible.\nMy own experience is a search for bliss and you will also find god. But then it will not be a belief, it will be your experience. In fact god will be another name for bliss and nothing more.\nSo here, everybody is welcome, because my concern is scientific. Meditation does not require any belief in fact it requires an open mind, unprejudiced. A Christian can meditate, a Buddhist can meditate, a Hindu can meditate, a Catholic can meditate, a communist can meditate -- there is no problem about it, because it is only going inwards, within your own being. It is the art of becoming silent. Even the atheist cannot deny that there are moments when he is more silent. He has to concede that much because he knows it is there are moments when he is in a turmoil and there are moments when he is absolutely calm.\nMeditation is nothing but a deepening process of your inner calm. Once your inner silence has become total, suddenly you become aware of the phenomenon which is called god.\nSeek bliss and you will find god. Try to find god and you will simply find more and more conflicting philosophies. You will get more and more confused. Rather than getting silence and peace, you will be getting more and more mad.\nSo let this be clear from the very beginning: our concern is not religious, our concern is scientific. Of course it leads to religion, but that is another thing. It happens of its own accord.\nThe Imprisoned Splendor Chapter #11\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2263","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_imprisoned_splendour/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_imprisoned_splendour/>The Imprisoned Splendour</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2263 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Imprisoned_Splendour/part10.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

looks for philosophy it looks very ordinary. But if one simply listens
to the Koran recited, one can be overwhelmed. Without understanding a
single word of the Arabic, it will touch and move your heart because
then it will penetrate as pure music.</p><p>This has to be the criterion: if bliss really happens it is bound to
bring many songs to you.</p><p>Your so-called saints look so sad that I cannot believe that they
have experienced God; they must have imagined it. They are not dancing,
they are not singing, they are not celebrating. They look almost dead,
dull; they don't have any joy. They don't seem to have any life; they
seem to live a posthumous type of existence. They look ghostly. Maybe
the holy ghost has visited them, but not God. And the holy ghost does
not seem to be very holy either! Ghosts are not</p><p>known to be holy; they are unholy people. One should keep oneself out
of their way.</p><p>Your saints look ghostly, dead, utterly dead. They cannot laugh, they
cannot love, they cannot dance, they cannot sing. What kind of religion
is that? And this has happened all over the world. It has happened to
Christian saints, it has happened to Hindu saints, it has happened to
Buddhist saints. It seems to be something almost universal. But Buddha
was not like that, neither was Jesus like that, nor was Mohammed like
that.</p><p>The really religious people were full of juice, full of tremendous
life. They were really alive. The 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>ordinary people are not alive compared to them.</p><p>So remember this is a criterion: meditation succeeds only if it
brings bliss. And bliss is true only if great celebration explodes in
you that goes on and on, that knows no end. It knows only the
beginning.</p><p>Sannyas is the art of divine acting. You have to live in the world
but you have to think of the world only as a big drama. I am against
renouncing the world. You have not to escape from the world, you have to
live in it, but in a totally different way. Don't take it seriously,
take it very light-heartedly, take it as a cosmic joke. It is a cosmic
joke. In the East we call it god's play. If it is god's play then we are
just actors in it, and nobody takes acting seriously.</p><p>You can be a king in a drama, but you don't take it seriously. As the
curtain falls you forget all about your being a king; it does not go to
your head. That's how a sannyasin has to take the whole of life. If you
are rich, don't let it go to your head, or if you are poor, don't take
it seriously. We are all playing roles: play them as beautifully as
possible but continuously remember, that it is all a game. And when
death comes the final curtain drops. Then all actors disappear. They all
disappear into one universal energy.</p><p>If one can live in the world remembering this, one is totally freed
from all misery. Misery is a by-product of taking things seriously and
bliss is a by- product of taking things lightly. Take life as fun;
rejoice in it.</p><p>Bliss is the god of gods. The real search of every being is bliss.
Sannyas is not interested in god directly because that creates
unnecessary complexities. There are believers and there are
non-believers -- and even the believers differ. There are three hundred
religions on the earth and almost three thousand sects within those
religions. That means there are three thousand concepts about god. If
one wants to enquire into god one gets into an unnecessary puzzle and
one cannot sort it out. It is impossible.</p><p>My own experience is a search for bliss and you will also find god.
But then it will not be a belief, it will be your experience. In fact
god will be another name for bliss and nothing more.</p><p>So here, everybody is welcome, because my concern is scientific.
Meditation does not require <em>any</em> belief in fact it requires an
open mind, unprejudiced. A Christian can meditate, a Buddhist can
meditate, a Hindu can meditate, a Catholic can meditate, a communist can
meditate -- there is no problem about it, because it is only going
inwards, within your own being. It is the art of becoming silent. Even
the atheist cannot deny that there are moments when he is more silent.
He has to concede that much because he knows it is there are moments
when he is in a turmoil and there are moments when he is absolutely
calm.</p><p>Meditation is nothing but a deepening process of your inner calm.
Once your inner silence has become total, suddenly you become aware of
the phenomenon which is called god.</p><p>Seek bliss and you will find god. Try to find god and you will simply
find more and more conflicting philosophies. You will get more and more
confused. Rather than getting silence and peace, you will be getting
more and more mad.</p><p>So let this be clear from the very beginning: our concern is not
religious, our concern is scientific. Of course it leads to religion,
but that is another thing. It happens of its own accord.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=the-imprisoned-splendor>The Imprisoned Splendor</h3><p>Chapter #11</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

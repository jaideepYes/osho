It is for reference purposes only.]\nThere is no heaven and no hell outside. Both are within, and we create them. If we live unconsciously we go on creating misery for ourselves. But the strategy of the unconscious mind is that it always throws the responsibility on others; that's its protection. Then it goes on working from behind.\nA sannyasin has to take the total responsibility upon himself. It is hard in the beginning because our habit is to throw it on others. It seems convenient and comfortable that others are making you miserable.\nBut nobody can make you miserable; it is always your own work. Maybe you are not aware of how you are doing it you may be completely oblivious of it; you may never have looked into the mechanism of the mind which creates misery,\nThat's the first thing a sannyasin has to do: he has to become more and more alert about the functioning of his mind. Then the truth strikes home, 'I am the creator of my misery, of my hell.' And immediately another insight opens up: 'If it is so, then I can also create my own paradise.' The energy that becomes misery is the same energy that becomes bliss. When your energy is not flowing in tune with existence it 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ncreates misery. When it is attuned with existence it creates bliss. Hence this is my definition of paradise: to be in deep harmony with existence, to be so totally in tune with existence that you disappear, that you are no more a separate entity, that you are just nothingness and the existence is allowed to flow through you without any interference on your part. Then great joy arises. Then you are as blissful as the flowers and the stars. Then you are as silent and as full of songs as existence itself.\nThis is what I mean by god-realisation.\nMeditation is not something external, it is not something that has to be added to you from the outside. It is not extrinsic, it is intrinsic. It is your own nature functioning in deep inner harmony. One can function as a chaos, one can also function as a cosmos. One can function as a crowd, as a marketplace -- full of noise.\nOne can function as tremendously beautiful music, as a silent shrine in the mountains. It all depends on how you enter into your being.\nIf you enter through the gate of the mind you will find only chaos. Mind functions like a prism, it divides. A ray passing through a prism becomes divided into seven colours. Before entering the prism it was white, it was pure white. As it enters and passes through the prism it is no more one, it is seven. That's how the rainbow is created and that's how the whole world is created. It is the prism of the mind that creates the illusion of many-ness, otherwise we are all one. But if you enter through the prism you cannot find ss anywhere.\nThere is another door, a secret door. That door is called meditation. It simply means a state of no-mind.\nYou can enter into your being from a state of no-mind. Mind means thoughts, no-mind means thoughtless consciousness. Mind means many things; memories, imagination, desires, dreams, projections, past and the future. No-mind means no desire, no imagination, no dreams, no projection , no past, no future, only the\npresent, just the present, just this moment, here and now. And then suddenly, you will find your self-nature. That is godliness and that is bliss, that is peace, that is love, that is going beyond time and entering into eternity.\nIf you live in the mind, you live in the fear of death. If you start moving through meditation all fear of death disappears. Suddenly you are aware that you have never been born and you can never die. You have always been here and now and you will always be here and now. The bodies change -- those are just forms.\nSometimes you may be in a body and sometimes you may not be in a body. And to be in a body is not such a great thing; in fact it is a confinement.\nHence the whole mystic approach towards life is how to go beyond body and mind, how to know that which is infinite in you -- the vast, the unbounded, the oceanic. It brings freedom.\nThe ultimate state of consciousness is not a serious phenomenon. It is not sombre, it is not sad. It is full of joy, full of laughter, full of celebration, full of song and dance, because it is a fulfillment: you have come to the ultimate peak of your being. And then flowering happens and your perfume is released to the winds. It can't be serious and sad.\nAll your saints look miserable. They don't seem to have even touched on what I am talking about. They are ascetic people, and asceticism is a kind of masochism, it is self-torture. And when you torture yourself you cannot be joyous -- it is against nature. Nobody can be joyous against nature. The more natural you are, the more joyous; the less natural, the less joyous.\nChristians say Jesus never laughed. I cannot believe it. I know Jesus directly -- I have a direct line with him! What these fools are saying is absolute nonsense. If Jesus never laughed then nobody can never laugh.\nIf I had to write the gospels, the last thing that I would write would be that he laughed loudly on the cross.\nHe must have had the last laugh!\nThat's exactly what happened in the case of Al-Hillaj Mansoor -- a Sufi who was killed by the Mohammedans. The last thing he did was to laugh loudly. For a moment even his enemies were shocked.\nThey could not believe their eyes: had he gone mad or something? -- because this was not the moment to laugh. If he had wept, cried, prayed, it would have been understandable, but this laughter was absolutely incomprehensible.\nSomebody asked, \"Why are you laughing, Al-Hillaj? Have you gone mad?\" He said, \"I am laughing because I am not the one that you are killing -- you are killing somebody else. I am laughing at the whole absurdity of it. You cannot kill me, I am beyond death. You are killing somebody else, some poor fellow who has nothing to do with me.\n\"And I am also laughing at God -- I am telling him through my laughter, 'You can't deceive me. You can 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nplay all kinds of tricks on me but you cannot take my laughter away.' This is his last test. He is trying his last trick on me. He wants to see now if my laughter is real or unreal. If I can laugh through death, that means my laughter was real, was authentic.\"\nHe died laughing.\nThe true mystic is not an ascetic, is not selftorturing. He loves life, he enjoys life, because life is nothing but God manifest. A true mystic is full of songs. Each of his words is a song. Rightly understood, each of his movements is a dance; rightly understood, each of his gestures is a celebration.\nThis happens only because of the ultimate state of consciousness. When you have touched the highest peak, when there is no more beyond, when you have gone beyond the beyond... when everything is left behind, the body far far away, down in the valley, mind also somewhere on the way, and you are just a pure consciousness, just a pure mirror reflecting nothing, no content, just pure consciousness, no object, just pure subjectivity -- that's called samadhi. And then thousands of songs will start arising out of your being, thousands of flowers will bloom. And unless that happens no man is fulfilled, no man can ever be contented; no man should ever be contented before this happens.\nOne should carry a divine discontent within one's heart. One should go on carrying the divine discontent for this ultimate goal. One should become an intense longing to achieve samadhi, to achieve superconsciousness. It is possible, because it has happened to other human beings; to Jesus, to Buddha, to Zarathustra, to Lao Tzu. It can happen to you, it can happen to everybody. It is everybody's birthright, we just have to claim it.\nTo be a sannyasin means the beginning of the claim, the beginning of the pilgrimage.\nThe Imprisoned Splendor Chapter #9\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1504","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_imprisoned_splendour/part8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_imprisoned_splendour/>The Imprisoned Splendour</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1504 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Imprisoned_Splendour/part8.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

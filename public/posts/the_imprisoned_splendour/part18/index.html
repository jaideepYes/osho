It is for reference purposes only.]\nMan is a seed, a seed of great potential. But millions of people die without ever realising that potential, they never come to a flowering. It is only through meditation -- there is no other way, there never has been, there will never be -- meditation is the only way to bring your potential into reality, to transform it into actuality. Seeds can become flowers, and not ordinary flowers either -- not flowers that exist only for the moment and then are gone but flowers of eternity, not of time, flowers which defy death, flowers which are undying, which know no beginning, no end, which are beyond time and beyond space too.\nThe art of bringing those flowers into your being is meditation. And meditation is a simple process, the same as the process of bringing a seed into life. The seed is almost dead, but If it falls into the soil and is ready to die into the soil, then immediately life springs up, then a sprout comes up. Soon it will become a bush or a tree with a profusion of flowers.\nThe same is the art of meditation. It is nothing but the courage to surrender, the courage to die as an ego.\nEgo is like a hard crust that surrounds everybody, the hard crust that surrounds every seed; it is protective. It is good as far as it goes, but if it remains forever\nthen it becomes a grave. It protects the seed till it come to the right soil, then it simply disappears.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nTo be with a master means to be ready to die. The ancient scriptures of the East say the master is death a very strange statement but very true. And the disciple is one who is tired of the ego, its misery, its agony, its darkness, and who has come to a conclusion that there is no way within the ego, one has to take a jump out of it.\nInitiation is a death -- the death of the ego, but the death of the ego becomes the birth of your real being.\nThe death of the ego is the death of all that is dead in you and the beginning of all that is really alive in you.\nMisery only proves one thing, that the person is stupid, that he has got no intelligence. Bliss proves just the contrary - that the person is intelligent, that he knows how to live, that he knows how to enjoy, that he knows how to use this great opportunity of life.\nThe miserable person is one who has not yet discovered his intelligence. He can go on trying everything\n-- nothing is going to work, because misery is a by-product. The miserable person tries not to be miserable, but whatsoever he does will create more misery because all those actions will be coming out of his stupidity. He will get into the mess more and more and he will become more and more desperate. And the more desperate one is, the more one tries each and everything to come out of it. But unless you radically change your own being nothing can help.\nThe miserable person can move from a hut into a palace -- nothing will change. He will remain miserable, he may even become more miserable in the palace\nbecause a palace has more space. And whatsoever he does is bound to create misery. The miserable person can have money, power, prestige, but he will create misery out of it.\nYou can see very rich people utterly miserable, very powerful people almost going insane, because they have not changed the radical, the essential, the fundamental. They have been trying to change the circumference instead of changing the centre. A sannyasin is one who becomes aware of this phenomenon.\nThis is a simple arithmetic of life, that 'If I am miserable, then I am wrong somewhere -- deep down I am not behaving intelligently. I am messing things up.' So rather than doing anything on the outside, it is better first to stop doing everything and move inwards to discover one's intelligence. And everybody brings intelligence into the world, nobody comes without intelligence. Life is intrinsically intelligence, but it has to be discovered. You have to dig for it.\nIt is just like water: it is everywhere, you just have to dig a well to find it. Maybe somewhere it is thirty feet below, somewhere forty feet, somewhere sixty feet, but it is always there. Even in the desert it is there; you may have to go a little deeper... Exactly like that, intelligence is in every person. We have to remove a few rocks, a little earth, and we will be able to find it.\nThis is the first step of the sannyasins: to discover one's intelligence, and then whatsoever you do will bring bliss to you. In fact you will be surprised to know, you may go on doing the things that you were doing before, but the same things that were bringing you misery before, will bring you bliss now. You are doing exactly the same things -- but it is not a matter of what you do. The real matter depends on who the doer is, from where the act arises -- from the circumference or from the centre, from the conditioning of the society, or from the natural spontaneous tao within you.\nBliss is a criterion. Whenever your actions tart bringing bliss to you, now you can move with the solid confidence that you are on the right track. whenever your actions bring misery -- beware! Better to stop before you take any more steps into the same direction. And don't start running into the opposite direction either, because directions are not the question: discover your intelligence. Everything depends on your intelligence, and out of intelligence there is beauty, there is bliss, there is benediction.\nMeditation is the discovery of the inner flame. It is already there; we have not to create it, we have only to become connected with it. We have become disconnected, we have lost contact with our own self -- that's why there is so much darkness in life. Once we are bridged with our own light all darkness disappears.\nAnd the miracle is that we are carrying that light with us every moment of our life, without using it. And we are suffering because we are not using it. We are really in anguish, we are creating hell. We are stumbling everywhere because it is all darkness. We want to do good but whatsoever we do turns out to be bad.\nEverybody wants to do good, everybody at least intends to do good, but nothing seems to work. Parents do harm to children -- and they love their children; nobody can doubt their love. But their love is without any light, it is groping in darkness. Wives love their husbands, husbands love their wives, but there is only conflict, continuous struggle. Slowly slowly people only learn to tolerate each other; that's all. That is not 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nharmony, that is not joy; that is just calculation. There is nothing else to dot we are tired of fighting so we will tolerate each other. But deep down there is great hatred and it erupts once in a while, again and again.\nChildren want to love their parents but they hate them. d because they want to love their parents and they cannot, they feel guilty. And they will fell guilty for their whole life.\nEverything seems to be unnecessarily complicated for the simple reason that we don't seek and search for our inner light.\nMy effort here is to help you to find your own light. I don't give you any other discipline, I don't give you any other ritual, I don't give you any morality, I don't give you any commandments. My work is very simple in a way, but sometimes it's the simple that we go on missing because it is so obvious. My work consists of only one thing: to bridge you again with your innermost core, with your\nflame. Once that happens you are transformed, you are reborn, you are no more the old self. Then your whole life changes, without any effort. And when things charge without any effort there is great beauty. There is no struggle, there is no imposition, there is ro cultivation, there is no discipline. There is only an understanding -- and understanding is liberating. It is the only liberation. there is.\nMeditation is surrender of the ego, of the mind, of all that you have been up to now, of the whole past.\nOne has to go through a complete renewal, a death and a rebirth. You have to become discontinuous with the past, as if you are born this very moment, as if your whole part were just a fiction that you have read somewhere or a movie that you have seen, or a dream.\nBecoming a sannyasin means becoming disconnected with the past, because the past is the only problem. And rather than solving problems it is better to put aside the whole past. That's where the approach of meditation and psychoanalysis differs: psychoanalysis goes on dissecting the whole bullshit: go on dissecting and dissecting. There is no end to it because a person gathers so much bullshit in his whole life that it takes years. Three years is not enough, even seven years is not enough. There are people who have been in psychoanalysis for ten years, twelve years, and it is still incomplete. I have not seen a single person whose psychoanalysis is complete; it cannot be complete, because while you are going through psychoanalysis, dissecting your past, you are creating a new past every day.\nIf you go through psychoanalysis for ten years, then those ten years will become your new past, now dissect them. It is an infinite regress. And in a life of seventy years, if on has to go on dissecting, one gathers so much dust in twenty-four hours that if one wants to dissect everything and analyse everything --\nwhy this is so, what is beyond it - one will get more and more into trouble. And not only what you think has to be dissected, what you dream has to be dissected. It is an impossible process. It may help you in a certain way to become adjusted to the society, but the society itself is insane. To get adjusted to an insane society is not sanity. It will help you to be at ease with other mad people, but they are mad and you will be mad. There are two kinds of madness: the normal kind, the average kind, and the little-bit-abnormal kind. The abnormal person is thought to be mentally ill, and the normally insane is the average person. The\npsychoanalists' work is to help the abnormally mad to become normally mad -- that's all.\nMeditation has a totally different approach. It functions like a sword: it simply cuts the whole thing off.\nWhy bother about it? We can simply slip out of it just like a snake slips out of its old skin. There is no need even to look back. Why bother about it?\nAnd that's what sannyas is. Slip out of the past. The past is not the only problem, it also creates other problems; it creates the future. It is out of the past that you this; about your future, you go on imagining your future in terms of the past. Whatsoever you loved in the past, you would like to have more of that in the future, and whatsoever is painful you would not like to have in the future. So your future is carved out of the past. It is not going to be something really new; it is going to be the past a little modified, a little refined, but it is going to be the past.\nAnd remember one thing: if you choose anything from the past, if you choose the good things from the past, the bad things are bound to come with them. They are together; you cannot leave them aside. So you will be disillusioned. You cannot say 'I will only choose the roses and leave the thorns. Those thorns are part of the same bush, they come with the roses. If you want the roses those thorns will be there.\nAnd between the past and the future you lose track of the present, which is the only reality.\nMeditation means moving into the present. Disconnecting yourself from the past simply means disconnecting yourself from the future too. And then there is nothing left except the present, except this moment nothing is left. And just see the point: in this moment where is the problem? What is there to dissect and analyse? There is no problem at all. And if one can enter into the present moment there is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nimmediate freedom, immediate bliss, immediate realisation of truth, of god, of beauty.\nSurrendering the past is the only way of entering into the present. And to enter the present is the way of the sannyasin. The sannyasin lives in the now, in the here. He has no other concern.\nMy vision of god is a god of bliss and songs. So If you really want to know what god is, you have to know what bliss is, you have to become more and more song-full, dance-full. You have to become more and more celebrating.\nThe old religions have been teaching people celibacy. I teach celebration! Why have been teaching people seriousness I teach singing, dancing. They have been teaching people to have long faces, my whole effort here is to give you love and laughter. If one can become laughter, if one can become love, then there is no need of any other prayer, one has already entered into the divine.\nI have never seen any sad person enter into god. The only way towards god is the way of dancing. So learn to dance, sing! celebrate, rejoice, and then you will find god anywhere. Then each experience is divine and the ordinary starts changing into the extraordinary, the mundane disappears into the sacred. The whole of life becomes so god-full that it is not a question of some god somewhere above, in the skies wherever you are, you are surrounded by god, You are always walking on holy ground, Then each stone has a sermon in it and each rock is a scripture. One just needs a heart, a dancing heart, to see, to feel, to be!\nThe Imprisoned Splendor Chapter #19\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2550","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_imprisoned_splendour/part18/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_imprisoned_splendour/>The Imprisoned Splendour</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2550 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Imprisoned_Splendour/part18.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

stumbling everywhere because it is all darkness. We want to do good but
whatsoever we do turns out to be bad.</p><p>Everybody wants to do good, everybody at least intends to do good,
but nothing seems to work. Parents do harm to children -- and they
<em>love</em> their children; nobody can doubt their love. But their
love is without any light, it is groping in darkness. Wives love their
husbands, husbands love their wives, but there is only conflict,
continuous struggle. Slowly slowly people only learn to tolerate each
other; that's all. That is not 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

else to dot we are tired of fighting so we will tolerate each other. But
deep down there is great hatred and it erupts once in a while, again and
again.</p><p>Children want to love their parents but they hate them. d because
they want to love their parents and they cannot, they feel guilty. And
they will fell guilty for their whole life.</p><p>Everything seems to be unnecessarily complicated for the simple
reason that we don't seek and search for our inner light.</p><p>My effort here is to help you to find your own light. I don't give
you any other discipline, I don't give you any other ritual, I don't
give you any morality, I don't give you any commandments. My work is
very simple in a way, but sometimes it's the simple that we go on
missing because it is so obvious. My work consists of only one thing: to
bridge you again with your innermost core, with your</p><p>flame. Once that happens you are transformed, you are reborn, you are
no more the old self. Then your whole life changes, without any effort.
And when things charge without any effort there is great beauty. There
is no struggle, there is no imposition, there is ro cultivation, there
is no discipline. There is only an understanding -- and understanding is
liberating. It is the only liberation. there is.</p><p>Meditation is surrender of the ego, of the mind, of all that you have
been up to now, of the whole past.</p><p>One has to go through a complete renewal, a death and a rebirth. You
have to become discontinuous with the past, as if you are born
<em>this</em> very moment, as if your whole part were just a fiction
that you have read somewhere or a movie that you have seen, or a
dream.</p><p>Becoming a sannyasin means becoming disconnected with the past,
because the past is the only problem. And rather than solving problems
it is better to put aside the whole past. That's where the approach of
meditation and psychoanalysis differs: psychoanalysis goes on dissecting
the whole bullshit: go on dissecting and dissecting. There is no end to
it because a person gathers so much bullshit in his whole life that it
takes years. Three years is not enough, even seven years is not enough.
There are people who have been in psychoanalysis for ten years, twelve
years, and it is still incomplete. I have not seen a single person whose
psychoanalysis is complete; it cannot be complete, because while you are
going through psychoanalysis, dissecting your past, you are creating a
new past every day.</p><p>If you go through psychoanalysis for ten years, then those ten years
will become your new past, now dissect them. It is an infinite regress.
And in a life of seventy years, if on has to go on dissecting, one
gathers so much dust in twenty-four hours that if one wants to dissect
everything and analyse everything --</p><p>why this is so, what is beyond it - one will get more and more into
trouble. And not only what you think has to be dissected, what you dream
has to be dissected. It is an impossible process. It may help you in a
certain way to become adjusted to the society, but the society itself is
insane. To get adjusted to an insane society is not sanity. It will help
you to be at ease with other mad people, but they are mad and you will
be mad. There are two kinds of madness: the normal kind, the average
kind, and the little-bit-abnormal kind. The abnormal person is thought
to be mentally ill, and the normally insane is the average person.
The</p><p>psychoanalists' work is to help the abnormally mad to become normally
mad -- that's all.</p><p>Meditation has a totally different approach. It functions like a
sword: it simply cuts the whole thing off.</p><p>Why bother about it? We can simply slip out of it just like a snake
slips out of its old skin. There is no need even to look back. Why
bother about it?</p><p>And that's what sannyas is. Slip out of the past. The past is not the
only problem, it also creates other problems; it creates the future. It
is out of the past that you this; about your future, you go on imagining
your future in terms of the past. Whatsoever you loved in the past, you
would like to have more of that in the future, and whatsoever is painful
you would not like to have in the future. So your future is carved out
of the past. It is not going to be something really new; it is going to
be the past a little modified, a little refined, but it is going to be
the past.</p><p>And remember one thing: if you choose anything from the past, if you
choose the good things from the past, the bad things are bound to come
with them. They are together; you cannot leave them aside. So you will
be disillusioned. You cannot say 'I will only choose the roses and leave
the thorns. Those thorns are part of the same bush, they come with the
roses. If you want the roses those thorns will be there.</p><p>And between the past and the future you lose track of the present,
which is the only reality.</p><p>Meditation means moving into the present. Disconnecting yourself from
the past simply means disconnecting yourself from the future too. And
then there is nothing left except the present, except this moment
nothing is left. And just see the point: in this moment where is the
problem? What is there to dissect and analyse? There is no problem at
all. And if one can enter into the present moment there is 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

of god, of beauty.</p><p>Surrendering the past is the only way of entering into the present.
And to enter the present is the way of the sannyasin. The sannyasin
lives in the now, in the here. He has no other concern.</p><p>My vision of god is a god of bliss and songs. So If you really want
to know what god is, you have to know what bliss is, you have to become
more and more song-full, dance-full. You have to become more and more
celebrating.</p><p>The old religions have been teaching people celibacy. I teach
celebration! Why have been teaching people seriousness I teach singing,
dancing. They have been teaching people to have long faces, my whole
effort here is to give you love and laughter. If one can become
laughter, if one can become love, then there is no need of any other
prayer, one has already entered into the divine.</p><p>I have never seen any sad person enter into god. The only way towards
god is the way of dancing. So learn to dance, sing! celebrate, rejoice,
and then you will find god anywhere. Then each experience is divine and
the ordinary starts changing into the extraordinary, the mundane
disappears into the sacred. The whole of life becomes so god-full that
it is not a question of some god somewhere above, in the skies wherever
you are, you are surrounded by god, You are always walking on holy
ground, Then each stone has a sermon in it and each rock is a scripture.
One just needs a heart, a dancing heart, to see, to feel, to be!</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=the-imprisoned-splendor>The Imprisoned Splendor</h3><p>Chapter #19</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

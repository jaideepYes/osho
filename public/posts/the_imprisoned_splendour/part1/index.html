We are ready to die for it, but we are not ready to let it die because it defines us, it gives us an identity. It gives us a separate existence. It makes us feel important, significant.\nBut because basically the ego is a false phenomenon all these feelings are rooted in a fallacy; hence deep down we are always aware that the importance that ego gives is bogus, it is phony. We know it and yet we don't want to know it. We are aware of it and yet we don't want to know it. We are aware of it yet we want to\nbe oblivious of it. This is the human dilemma,\nTo get into love means to get out of this dilemma, to drop the fallacy, to drop the phony and the pseudo and to be simply a non-entity, a nothingness. But out of that nothingness something of immense value arises. life becomes a celebration.\nWith ego life is a misery, because if you are rooted in something false you cannot celebrate. Only truth can release the energies of celebration in you. Only truth can become a song in your heart. The ego is the greatest lie: all other lies are by-products of it. And because it is a lie it stinks, because it is a lie it creates a thousand and one problems around itself. It hides behind those problems. It creates a great facade of misery, so many clouds of misery that you get involved in misery and you forget everything about the root cause of it all.\nThe moment ego is dropped -- and it is only a question of your decision, if you want to drop it you can drop it right now, nothing can prevent you from dropping it except yourself -- instantly your life goes through a radical change, it goes through a revolution. Great poetry and great music arises in you.\nJust a few moments ago I was reading these lines of Walt Whitman -- I love these lines! He was one of the most significant poets who has ever walked on the earth.\nHe says:\nI celebrate myself, I sing myself. And what I assume you shall assume.\nFor every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.\nThat's the message of all the seers, of all those who have known, and particularly my message is celebration.\nLet your whole heart say 'I celebrate myself, I sing myself.' But remember, the self is not the ego, the self is something beyond the ego. The ego is your creation; the self is part of god, the self is part oh the supreme self. The self does not make you a separate individual, it does not make an island of you. It keeps you one with the whole; hence the celebration, hence the joy, hence the ecstasy.\nWalt Whitman's line defines my sannyas precisely. Remember it.\nLove, bliss, celebration, god, truth, freedom -- they are different aspects of the same phenomenon. Ego dropped, you enter into a multi-dimensional reality which contains all these things. But one certainly needs courage, one needs guts. Be courageous enough to live whole-heartedly to live in tune with the infinite, with the eternal.\nTruth is beyond all scriptures because it is beyond mind itself. Scriptures are products of the mind. All philosophies, all ideologies, all theorisations, are nothing but fabrications, fictions of the mind.\nThey can be beautiful fictions, sweet, nice -- but fictions are fictions all the same. A dream can be a nightmare or a dream can be a very beautiful, sweet dream, but a dream is a dream, it is not reality.\nYes, there are beautiful scriptures in the world written by the most beautiful people, but truth cannot be written. It cannot even be expressed, it cannot be communicated, it cannot be transferred from one person to another. Yes, there is a certain communion it is not communication. That communion happens between a master and a disciple in total silence, from heart to heart, not from mind to mind. The master says nothing, the disciple heard nothing, yet everything is said and everything is heard. Nothing is said, nothing is heard yet everything is understood.\nThis is the most mysterious phenomenon in existence, the master-disciple relationship, mysterious 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbecause it is not intellectually comprehensible. It cannot be proved in a logical way. It is not logical at all.\nHence those who become sannyasins out of a logical conviction, who through listening to me, are convinced that what I am saying is true, are only on the periphery. The true disciple has nothing to do with what I am saying, the true\ndisciple has something to do with what I am. The true sannyasin falls in love. It is not a question of conviction. It is something far more, something far more mysterious, something transcendental; hence a real disciple cannot explain to anybody else what has happened. Everybody will think that he has gone mad, that he has been hypnotised, that he is no more in his senses.\nAnd the people who think like that are not at fault at all; the whole fault is the disciple's -- he cannot explain. But what can the disciple do about it? The whole fault lies with reality itself.\nThere are things which are not explainable. There are things which elude all rationalisation. And in fact, life begins only when you has come in contact with something which is incomprehensible, inexplicable, indefinable, unprovable and yet, somewhere deep down your heart says it is so. It puts aside all the arguments of the mind. It says to the mind, 'Keep quiet. You need not bother. Now I have stumbled into something which is beyond you.' And nothing can be done about it to make it comprehensible. It is a communion.\nSannyas is a true discipleship. It is not belief, it is not conviction, it is not accepting a certain philosophy of life. It is falling totally in love -- and a love too of a very new quality. It has nothing to do with your so-called ordinary love. Just one thing is in common, that the ordinary love also has something incomprehensible in it, but only something a very small particle of the incomprehensible in it -- and that is totally incomprehensible. Hence those who have loved can understand it a little bit.\nBut very few people have ever loved. Yes, they have known lust and they have called it love, but it is not love. They have known sex and they have called it love, but it is not love. people are very clever at giving beautiful name to ugly things. They have to give beautiful names, otherwise things look so absurd, so ridiculous. Man tries to create at least a beautiful facade; and behind the facade everything ugly can be continued.\nThe ordinary love contains so much jealousy, so much possessiveness, so much enmity, hatred. Just a little bit of it belongs to the beyond. But those who have known even that little bit say be able to understand it -- otherwise the phenomenon of disciplehood is bound to be ridiculed by those who have never tasted the nectar of it.\nThe disciple has to be courageous, courageous enough to be called a madman, courageous enough to be called blind, courageous enough to be thought hypnotised. And he has to take these things in a very loving way. He has to understand and he has to be compassionate, kind, sympathetic, because what can others do?\nThey are functioning according to their minds, and this is something not of the mind.\nNo scripture can be of any help, only a living master can resurrect you, Only a Jesus can call forth Lazarus from the dead. The Bible cannot do it -- you can try it. You can put the Bible on a dead man's chest and try -- the Bible is there and the dead man is there, but Lazarus is not going to be resurrected. The Bible itself is dead, so are all the scriptures. A Jesus is needed, that magic touch of a living master is needed.\nThe parable is beautiful. That's the state of every disciple, when he comes to a master he is dead, he is almost in his grave. The master calls forth, 'Come out, Lazarus, come out of your grave,' and the disciple has to listen, has to learn how to listen and has to go into the beyond with the master. It is a journey into the uncharted, into the unknown, but without it life is not life. Without it we live in pain, we don't live at all.\nOnly with something of the transcendental penetrating you do you become alive, you are reborn. Jesus says, 'Unless you are born again, you shall not enter into my kingdom of god.' This is the rebirth he is talking about -- sannyas is a rebirth.\nA sannyasin has to learn how to make life a festivity, how to make life a blissful festival. A sannyasin has not to be sad or serious. He has to know how to live, how to love, how to laugh. He has to become more passionate, more alive. He has to go deeper into life, as deep as possible, he has to be as total as possible.\nThe old idea of sannyas, of monkhood, was of renunciation: renounce life, escape from life, don't live at all, because life is against god. That is absolutely stupid! If life is against god what is god doing? Why does he go on creating life? Why did he create life in the first place?\nAll the religions of the world, the so-called religions, have been teaching a great contradiction. On one hand they say god created life. On the other hand they say, Renounce life, it is against god, unless you renounce you will not reach god, if\nyou renounce you become beloved of god. The contradiction is so clear, even a child can see the contradiction. It is so ridiculous if god creates life he cannot be against it.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nI am not against life, I am all for it. And my sannyasins have to learn not to escape, but to live intensely, to burn their life's torch from both ends simultaneously. Even a single moment of total festivity is enough; you will have tasted eternity and you will have known what god is.\nLife is the manifest form of god and celebration is his only prayer.\nThe Imprisoned Splendor Chapter #2\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1905","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_imprisoned_splendour/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_imprisoned_splendour/>The Imprisoned Splendour</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1905 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Imprisoned_Splendour/part1.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

scriptures. A Jesus is needed, that magic touch of a living master is
needed.</p><p>The parable is beautiful. That's the state of every disciple, when he
comes to a master he is dead, he is almost in his grave. The master
calls forth, 'Come out, Lazarus, come out of your grave,' and the
disciple has to listen, has to learn how to listen and has to go into
the beyond with the master. It is a journey into the uncharted, into the
unknown, but without it life is not life. Without it we live in pain, we
don't live at all.</p><p>Only with something of the transcendental penetrating you do you
become alive, you are reborn. Jesus says, 'Unless you are born again,
you shall not enter into my kingdom of god.' This is the rebirth he is
talking about -- sannyas is a rebirth.</p><p>A sannyasin has to learn how to make life a festivity, how to make
life a blissful festival. A sannyasin has not to be sad or serious. He
has to know how to live, how to love, how to laugh. He has to become
more passionate, more alive. He has to go deeper into life, as deep as
possible, he has to be as total as possible.</p><p>The old idea of sannyas, of monkhood, was of renunciation: renounce
life, escape from life, don't live at all, because life is against god.
That is absolutely stupid! If life is against god what is god doing? Why
does he go on creating life? Why did he create life in the first
place?</p><p>All the religions of the world, the so-called religions, have been
teaching a great contradiction. On one hand they say god created life.
On the other hand they say, Renounce life, it is against god, unless you
renounce you will not reach god, if</p><p>you renounce you become beloved of god. The contradiction is so
clear, even a child can see the contradiction. It is so ridiculous if
god creates life he cannot be against it.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

learn not to escape, but to live intensely, to burn their life's torch

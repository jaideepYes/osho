It is for reference purposes only.]\nGautam the Buddha introduced the word 'samyako'. His whole vision is based on that single word.\nEverything can either be right or wrong. There can be right love and wrong love. Before Buddha nobody thought in that way, people used to think love is always right. So it was thought about will, resolution, a man of will is always right. All the cultures up to now have been praising will-power, but Buddha says --\nand he is tremendously insightful -- that everything that can be right can be also be wrong, nothing can be absolutely right. Will-power can be wrong if it is used by the ego, then it will enhance the ego. And that's what happens in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred.\nIt can be right, but one has to be very alert and aware. Will-power can be right only if it is used for surrender. It is very paradoxical phenomenon, because ordinarily we think will and surrender are polar opposites, but there is only one right use of will, and that is: its surrender to the whole -- call it god, nature, tao or whatsoever you like.\nWill-power in the service of the person is dangerous, because the very idea of\nthe person is false; personality is illusory. We are not separate t the whole universe is one organic unity. We all exist together.\nEven a small blade of grass is connected to the far-away star. Everything is interlinked, intertwined. It is like a spider's web if you touch even one thread of it, the whole wave will be felt throughout the pattern.\nThrough even a slight touch the vibration will be felt throughout the web. So is the case with the universe.\nWe are not separate, we only appear separate. Hence if will is in the service of the person it is a wrong kind of will. It will lead you into more and more misery, into more and more conflict, violence.\nRight will means in the service of god. But then you are no more. Right will means that the will gathers itself and commits a suicide. But that can be done only by a man of will. Surrender cannot be done by people who don't have any wills, who are always lukewarm, half-hearted, wavering. They cannot surrender.\nSurrender needs a certain integrity, a certain resolution, in fact it needs the greatest resolution possible.\nUnless you are totally in it, it is not going to happen. Even if you are holding back a little bit it is not surrender. And through that which you are holding back, everything will return again; you will be the same.\nSurrender has to be irrevocable. One has to commit oneself so totally that there is no going back. The bridge is burned, you have thrown the ladder.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nRight will mean a will which is capable of committing suicide. It is a very strange phenomenon but that's how life is; it is very paradoxical. First we have to learn how to create an ego and then the ego is ripe, strong enough, then we have\nto learn how to drop it. One would think it would have been more logical not to develop it at all. But when you would never know the soy of dropping it, the freedom of dropping it. A person who has never been in a gaol has no consciousness about being free; being in a gaol is a prerequisite to know the taste of freedom.\nLife consists of contradictions -- that is its dialectics. A poor man never knows that he is poor. He looks poor only to the people who are not poor. He himself does not know that he is poor, he has nothing to compare his poverty with. To be really poor first you have to be rich and then you will know the pain of it, the agony of it. To really be a beggar, first you have to be an emperor, otherwise you will not know what it is to be a beggar.\nThe ego has to be strengthened only to be dropped. The will has to be sharpened only to be surrendered.\nKnowledge has to be gathered only to be unlearned. The day you unlearn whatsoever you have learned before, you become a child again, you are twice born. But this is not the same childhood, because the first childhood had no awareness of being knowledgeable; now you know what it means to be knowledgeable.\nAnd in dropping it you will feel such a great freedom, such great joy, such ecstasy, in fact you are not attaining anything.\nIn your childhood, in your first childhood you were the same, but you were completely unaware of it.\nThis whole process is needed to make you aware. Awareness comes through a dialectical process.\nSo will is good, right, only when you are capable of dropping it, if you cannot drop it, if you cling to it, if it becomes your whole life-pattern you miss the whole point. When it creates only misery and hell. Great will-power is needed to create hell or heaven. If you continue in it, it creates hell, if you jump out of it, it creates heaven.\nThe only evolution worth calling evolution is the evolution of bliss. If bliss is not growing you are not evolving. If bliss is not growing the society is not evolving. In fact, what people generally understand by evolution and progress is sheer\nnonsense.\nA more and more complicated technology does not mean evolution. It is so superficial. You can have more gadgets, you can have big machines, better aeroplanes, better trains, better houses, but you are the same person. You can reach the moon or even the stars one day, but what you are doing on the earth you will do on the moon. If you have been smoking cigarettes here you will smoke them there. If you have been playing cards here you will play cards there. If you have been drinking beer here you will carry beer to the moon. What else will you do there?\nIf man remains the same, there is no evolution. Then we go on living in a false kind of evolution, a substitute evolution which gives the fallacious appearance that man is evolving. But for centuries man has not evolved. Only a few individuals here and there have evolved. You can come across a Buddha or a Jesus or a Zarathustra or a Lao Tzu, a Francis, a Kabir, a Bahauddin; there are very few people. Those who have really tasted the nectar of bliss are evolved human beings.\nEvolution has happened only to a few people. Just getting down from the trees and instead of walking on fours, walking on two, does not make you an evolved animal. It just makes you erect, vertical, that's all. If you look inside man's mind, he is still a monkey. One need not go very far, one can simply close one's eyes and see the mind and you will find all kinds of monkeyish things going on. So what evolution has happened? What nonsense is Darwin talking about?\nThe only difference is that monkeys have a few things more that man has lost; the monkeys have tails, and beautiful tails, very alive! Monkeys must be laughing at human beings, \"What kind of monkeys are they? What happened to their tails?\"\nAnd man has become weaker. You cannot fight bare-handed with a monkey -- impossible. Even a Mohammed Ali will be defeated! No tactics of boxing will help; a monkey is enough to kill any man!\nAnd one can feel jealous; monkeys jumping from one tree to another tree... just see their aliveness -- and try to do it... you will have multi-fractures! You will wake up after three days in a hospital! What kind of evolution is this? This is not real evolution.\nReal evolution can only be judged by blissfulness. And blissfulness grows with consciousness. They grow together, simultaneously; they are two aspects of the same coin. Either grow consciousness and you become more blissful or grow more blissful and you become more conscious. Start from anywhere --\nconsciousness or bliss -- and you will be growing. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThere are only two kinds of paths; a few paths are of consciousness, for example, Zen, and a few paths of bliss, for example, Sufis. Sufis live blissfully, and consciousness grows side by side. And Zen people grow consciousness, and bliss grows side by side. They are inseparable, so if you grow one, the other grows of its own accord. You need not bother about the two together.\nUnless one becomes a buddha, a christ, one has missed the great opportunity of evolving. All other progress is false, pseudo, remember it.\nSannyas is an effort in the right direction. It really releases your potential -- and man has infinite potential.\nMan can reach to the ultimate peaks of joy.\nWisdom does not come from knowledge, it comes from love. Wisdom has nothing to do with logic but it has everything to do with love. Knowledge depends on logic and knowledge can give you a false notion of being, because knowledge is imitative. You can repeat beautiful saying of Jesus, the beatitude, and if you go on repeating them long enough you will start believing, you will auto-hypnotise yourself by constant repetition. You will start thinking, as if you know, and you don't know at all.\nJesus is talking from the heart and you are learning from the head -- and the difference is vast. The difference is almost unbridgeable, it is so vast.\nKnowledge is cheap, easily available. One can just go on sitting in a library and go on collecting knowledge. Man has so great a memory that it is said a single man's memory system can contain all the libraries of the world. No computer has been yet evolved which can really compete with man's memory system. It is almost unlimited and it can create such a great illusion of being wise.\nWisdom is a totally different phenomenon. It comes through love, it grows in the heart, it is a heart flower. And the ways of the heart are totally different from the ways of the head.\nSannyas is a search for wisdom. I am not interested in imparting knowledge to you here. I am not a teacher. A teacher imparts knowledge, a master imparts being. A master does not each you, on the contrary, he helps you unlearn, he helps you to unburden, he helps you to come from the head to the heart. And once you are centred in the heart your life pulsates with a totally new energy. That energy is love. it is not that you become more loving, you become love itself. It is not a question of being in a love relationship, it is a question of being in a state of love. One is constantly in a state of love -- waking, sleeping, with people or alone, with people or with rocks -- it makes no difference, one goes on pulsating, radiating love energy. It becomes one's natural perfume. That perfume is the first proof of god and then more and more proofs go on coming.\nThere is no other proof for god except love. Logic is impotent, it cannot prove, it cannot disprove. It has nothing to do with love, hence theology is the most stupid idea. It means logic about god, theology. There is no logic about god. There have been lovers of god; but logicians are just befooling themselves and others.\nIf a logician is honest and sincere he is bound to be an atheist. He has to be an atheist, that is inevitable.\nIf a logician says that he is a theist he is dishonest; hence all theologicians are dishonest. Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan -- it doesn't matter to what sect and cult they belong.\nJesus is not a theologian, he is a lover of god. Jalaluddin is not a logician, he is a lover of god. and these lovers have really proved the existence of god, not by giving an argument but by their presence, by their very being, by their transformed existence, by their luminous life, by their radiant love.\nThe Imprisoned Splendor Chapter #3\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2138","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_imprisoned_splendour/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_imprisoned_splendour/>The Imprisoned Splendour</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2138 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Imprisoned_Splendour/part2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

from anywhere --</p><p>consciousness or bliss -- and you will be growing. 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>There are only two kinds of paths; a few paths are of consciousness,
for example, Zen, and a few paths of bliss, for example, Sufis. Sufis
live blissfully, and consciousness grows side by side. And Zen people
grow consciousness, and bliss grows side by side. They are inseparable,
so if you grow one, the other grows of its own accord. You need not
bother about the two together.</p><p>Unless one becomes a buddha, a christ, one has missed the great
opportunity of evolving. All other progress is false, pseudo, remember
it.</p><p>Sannyas is an effort in the right direction. It really releases your
potential -- and man has infinite potential.</p><p>Man can reach to the ultimate peaks of joy.</p><p>Wisdom does not come from knowledge, it comes from love. Wisdom has
nothing to do with logic but it has everything to do with love.
Knowledge depends on logic and knowledge can give you a false notion of
being, because knowledge is imitative. You can repeat beautiful saying
of Jesus, the beatitude, and if you go on repeating them long enough you
will start believing, you will auto-hypnotise yourself by constant
repetition. You will start thinking, as if you know, and you don't know
at all.</p><p>Jesus is talking from the heart and you are learning from the head --
and the difference is vast. The difference is almost unbridgeable, it is
so vast.</p><p>Knowledge is cheap, easily available. One can just go on sitting in a
library and go on collecting knowledge. Man has so great a memory that
it is said a single man's memory system can contain all the libraries of
the world. No computer has been yet evolved which can really compete
with man's memory system. It is almost unlimited and it can create such
a great illusion of being wise.</p><p>Wisdom is a totally different phenomenon. It comes through love, it
grows in the heart, it is a heart flower. And the ways of the heart are
totally different from the ways of the head.</p><p>Sannyas is a search for wisdom. I am not interested in imparting
knowledge to you here. I am not a teacher. A teacher imparts knowledge,
a master imparts being. A master does not each you, on the contrary, he
helps you unlearn, he helps you to unburden, he helps you to come from
the head to the heart. And once you are centred in the heart your life
pulsates with a totally new energy. That energy is love. it is not that
you become more loving, you become love itself. It is not a question of
being in a love relationship, it is a question of being in a state of
love. One is constantly in a state of love -- waking, sleeping, with
people or alone, with people or with rocks -- it makes no difference,
one goes on pulsating, radiating love energy. It becomes one's natural
perfume. That perfume is the first proof of god and then more and more
proofs go on coming.</p><p>There is no other proof for god except love. Logic is impotent, it
cannot prove, it cannot disprove. It has nothing to do with love, hence
theology is the most stupid idea. It means logic about god, theology.
There is no logic about god. There have been lovers of god; but
logicians are just befooling themselves and others.</p><p>If a logician is honest and sincere he is bound to be an atheist. He
<em>has</em> to be an atheist, that is inevitable.</p><p>If a logician says that he is a theist he is dishonest; hence all
theologicians are dishonest. Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan -- it doesn't
matter to what sect and cult they belong.</p><p>Jesus is not a theologian, he is a lover of god. Jalaluddin is not a
logician, he is a lover of god. and these lovers have really proved the
existence of god, not by giving an argument but by their presence, by
their very being, by their transformed existence, by their luminous
life, by their radiant love.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=the-imprisoned-splendor>The Imprisoned Splendor</h3><p>Chapter #3</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

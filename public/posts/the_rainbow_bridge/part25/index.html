Anand means bliss; dorian means bountiful, overflowing, abundant. The full name will mean bliss overflowing, bliss in a flood.\nBliss always comes in a flood. Bliss is not miserly. God is not miserly; only man with his cunning mind is a miser. God gives, and goes on giving for no motive at all; he does not desire anything in return. His joy is in giving itself. That’s how a sannyasin has to become: non-clinging to things, ready to give and share. Whatsoever one has, has to be shared.\nYou have only that which you share. You can have only that which has been shared. If you hold it back, it dies. And bliss grows more and more, the more we give it to people. Love grows more and more... Everything that is valuable grows by giving it.\nShare your joy, with people, with birds, with animals, with trees, and never be a miser. The miser lives in hell. Paradise is only for the non-miserly.\nAnand Marilyn. Anand means bliss; marilyn is a combination of two words, mary and linda. Mary is Hebrew; it means rebellion. Linda is Latin and means beautiful. Marilyn will mean beautiful rebellion. The full name will mean blissful beautiful rebellion.\nRebellion has those qualities. It is the door to bliss. The door to bliss opens only for those who are courageous enough to rebel against the dead crowd-mind. The crowd can never enter into the world of bliss. It is impossible, because the crowd has decided to be unintelligent. It has invested in being unintelligent and stupid – that’s the only way to be a part of a crowd. If you are intelligent, if you go on sharpening your intelligence, you cannot be a conformist; you will find a thousand-and-one reasons to rebel against the established society, the state and church. Because in the name of the society, state and church, so much nonsense continues that an intelligent person cannot tolerate it\nany more. To tolerate it you have to reduce your intelligence to the minimum; to be part of it, you have to separate from your own inner being. Being intelligent, being alert, is bound to take you into rebellion.\nRebellion opens the door for authentic individuality. It makes you a soul, it gives you dignity. It makes you spiritual. The crowd will remain sheepish – and it has never happened that a sheep has become enlightened.\nThe sheep cannot become enlightened; it does not want to become enlightened in the first place. It is afraid. It is afraid of being intelligent because it knows intelligence brings dangers; it is better to be stupid and part of the crowd, and follow the crowd. Only the stupid person can follow the crowd. The intelligent person stands on his own: he has a certain independence of thinking, of feeling, of being. And because rebellion opens doors to bliss, it makes you beautiful, it makes you valuable: it is only the rebellious man who reaches to the highest peaks of joy, understanding, truth. It is only the rebellious who reach to the highest Everest of being. And to be there is to be beautiful, to be there is to be blissful, to be there is to be in God.\nVeet Werner. Veet means going beyond, surpassing, transcending. Werner means a defender.\nAll defense has to be dropped; one has to be vulnerable. To defend means to remain closed, to defend means to go on thinking in terms of enmity. To defend means that you are not relaxed with existence: you are afraid, you are on guard, as if existence is an enemy. It is not, it is our mother; we came out of it, and one day we will go back into it. There is nothing to defend. We are waves in the ocean: what is there to defend? It is beautiful to be, and it is beautiful not to be. It is beautiful for the wave to rise, play for a moment with the rays of the sun and the wind, and then go back and disappear into the depths of the ocean.\nBirth and death are similar. Neither birth separates you from existence, nor death. Birth is the beginning of the wave, death is the disappearing of the wave – but the wave is always the ocean, whether it is or it is not. In being it is ocean, in non-being it is ocean. There is nothing to defend. And if we start defending, our whole energy is wasted, unnecessarily wasted in a futile effort, because to defend means we have taken it for granted that we are separate and that we are in danger, that there is insecurity, that we are not safe, that we are surrounded by something inimical. It is not so.\nWe are surrounded by something immensely friendly: the clouds, and the rain and the wind and the sun – they are all friendly; the whole existence befriends you. Being a sannyasin means dropping all armor, dropping all defense arrangements, transcending the fear of insecurity, transcending the fear that something may go wrong, that somebody may harm you.\nThere is nothing that can harm you, there is nothing that can be harmed. Once this vision becomes clear to you, you are a sannyasin. Once this vision settles in your heart, it will transform your whole life: you will start living in the same world in a totally different way. Then you live as love. Right now you live as fear – everybody lives as fear – and to live as fear is not to live at all. To live as love is the only way to live.\nI teach life. To me, life is God, and I teach love... to me, love is prayer. But love and life are possible only if you are utterly open.\nDeva Jennifer. Deva means God; jennifer means blessed – blessed by God.\nSannyas is a moment of blessing. On your part, you are ready to receive; on your part, you are willing to surrender. On God’s part, he is always ready to pour a thousand-and-one blessings on you. In fact whether we are ready or not, God goes on pouring, showering many joys, many flowers. But because we are not receptive we go on missing, because we are not receptive we cannot see. Those flowers are invisible; they can be seen only with the eyes of trust. Ordinary eyes can’t see them, and ordinary ears can’t hear them. They create beautiful music around you, they weave and spin beautiful patterns of light around you, and it is constantly happening, but physical senses are not capable of seeing them, of hearing them, of touching them.\nSomething non-physical needs to grow in you. The mystics have called that non-physical sensibility trust, faith. It grows in the very center of your heart. It becomes your sixth sense, and with its opening you enter into another world. You start seeing colors you had never seen before. You start seeing things which you had always passed by and had not ever paid any attention to. Small things: just a grass flower by the side of the road, and when the heart is open and the trust is flowing, then the small grass flower has tremendous beauty; something of the divine is in it. One is stunned by its beauty.\nIt can lead you into new realms of your own being. First it makes you aware of a tremendously beautiful existence, and then by and by it makes you aware of your own being, which is far more beautiful than the outer existence because it is flowering of consciousness. No rose can compete with it, no lotus even can compete with it.\nFeel blessed that the idea of becoming a sannyasin has happened to you. Feel blessed that you have been able to gather courage enough to be initiated. This is the beginning of a totally new life, the opening of a new chapter, and there are going to be many surprises...\n[A sannyasin says he is here for only a few days.]\nNext time come for a longer period... because much has to be done. Only small things they are, but the outcome is tremendously important.\nMan brings with him everything that is needed to become perfect, to become enlightened, to be a Buddha or a Jesus. Everybody brings everything that is required, but things are topsy-turvy. They are not where they should be, they are upside down; it iS a mess. Just a rearrangement is needed. Right things in right places, that’s the whole work of a Master: just to put things in the right places.\nOrdinarily man is a jigsaw puzzle: all the pieces are there which are needed, but they are in a state of chaos. And to be in chaos is to be in hell. To become a cosmos is the purpose of life. Sannyas is only an effort to create a certain cosmos in you. Chaos is bad only if it persists, because out of the chaos stars are born. Then it becomes a womb, then we feel even grateful to the chaos too: without it there would have been no cosmos.\nOrdinarily man is only noise, but the same noise can become a beautiful melody. That has to be done: before death comes, one has to become a symphony. The death too is beautiful if you can go singing into it, dancing into it, laughing into it. Then you transcend death, then it doesn’t happen to\nyou, it happens only to the body; you remain beyond. That is the ultimate achievement: to die and yet not to die, to die and yet remain deathless. And it is possible, so next time come for a longer period.\n[A sannyasin, leaving, says that since being here crying has become very significant for him and asks for a meditation to remain in contact with it. He likes the prayer meditation most. Osho checks his energy.]\nGood. You continue prayer meditation and if crying comes, don’t repress it; enjoy it, celebrate it. Prayer and crying are very similar. They can become part of one whole. In fact, only one who knows how to pray knows how to cry; it is crying before existence. It can have many shades: sometimes it can be of deep sadness, the sadness of separation from the total. Sometimes it can be of tremendous joy – the joy of being able to remember. Sometimes it can be of great contentment, because prayer attunes you with the whole and in that attunement, in that at-onement, great bliss is felt.\nAnd sometimes crying can be for no visible reason at all. It can be very mysterious. It can come from such deep sources in you that you cannot figure out why it is so. Don’t try to figure it out, because it is beyond intellect; it is existential, it is just like breathing. When one is really in a silent state, totally silent, a crying can happen, tears can come, your whole being can just be crying and crying. But after it you will feel so cleansed, you will feel the silence that comes only after a storm, you will feel showered, bathed, clean, so no need to figure out why.\nContinue prayer meditation and continue crying. If it stops don’t try to force it to come; that will be false. If it stops, that means its work is done; if it continues that means its work is still on. You should not decide, you should not put a limit on it, you should simply be available to it. If it comes, good; if it does not come, good.\nAnd whenever you need me, put it (a box) on the heart. Help my people there. Good.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1995","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_rainbow_bridge/part25/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_rainbow_bridge/>The Rainbow Bridge</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">25</h1><div class=post-meta>10 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1995 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Rainbow_Bridge/part25.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part24>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

with it. He likes the prayer meditation most. Osho checks his
energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>Good. You continue prayer meditation and if crying comes, don’t
repress it; enjoy it, celebrate it. Prayer and crying are very similar.
They can become part of one whole. In fact, only one who knows how to
pray knows how to cry; it is crying before existence. It can have many
shades: sometimes it can be of deep sadness, the sadness of separation
from the total. Sometimes it can be of tremendous joy – the joy of being
able to remember. Sometimes it can be of great contentment, because
prayer attunes you with the whole and in that attunement, in that
at-onement, great bliss is felt.</p><p><br></p><p>And sometimes crying can be for no visible reason at all. It can be
very mysterious. It can come from such deep sources in you that you
cannot figure out why it is so. Don’t try to figure it out, because it
is beyond intellect; it is existential, it is just like breathing. When
one is really in a silent state, totally silent, a crying can happen,
tears can come, your whole being can just be crying and crying. But
after it you will feel so cleansed, you will feel the silence that comes
only after a storm, you will feel showered, bathed, clean, so no need to
figure out why.</p><p><br></p><p>Continue prayer meditation and continue crying. If it stops don’t try
to force it to come; that will be false. If it stops, that means its
work is done; if it continues that means its work is still on. You
should not decide, you should not put a limit on it, you should simply
be available to it. If it comes, good; if it does not come, good.</p><p><br></p><p>And whenever you need me, put it (a box) on the heart. Help my people
there. Good.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part24>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

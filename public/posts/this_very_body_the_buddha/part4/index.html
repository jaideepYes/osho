You cannot be really afraid of that with which you are not at all acquainted. Fear is a relationship – you have to know something to be afraid of it. Nobody really is afraid of death. And whenever somebody says ‘I am afraid of death’ he is simply saying that he is afraid to lose life. Death is absolutely unknown. So everybody is afraid of life – it is life that is the problem, not death. It is life that gives you anguish and nights without sleep.\nAnd what is the fear of life? There are many fears but they can be reduced to a few basic fears. One is that life is slipping by and you have not lived yet. That’s the panic, basic panic – that life is going out of your hands, every moment you have less and less life. And you have not lived yet. Great fear arises: are you going to miss? Will you be able to make it this time? And who knows? There may be no other time. Life may not happen again – who knows? This seems to be the only life, and every day it is turning into a wasteland. Hence the fear.\nSecondly, it is life that ultimately brings death. Death is the crescendo of life, the finishing touch. If you are afraid of death, that too is basically fear of life – that life will bring death one day. That the trees will be there and the flowers will be there and the spring will come and the grass will be green and you will not be here.\nAnd while you are here you are not much here either. And sooner or later, grass will be growing on your grave. And you will not be able to walk on it. And while you can walk on it and enjoy the feel of it and the dewdrops and the coolness and the sunlit morning, you are not enjoying it. Because you cannot enjoy, that’s why you are afraid of life. And life is turning into death, the unknown. The known is always disappearing into the unknown. The light is always disappearing into darkness.\nSo life will take you one day to the door of death. But why are you not living? What hinders you from living? You have conditions, that’s what is hindering. You have conditions – that ‘If THIS happens, only then will I be happy.’ And life is not going to oblige you. You have to surrender to life. Your conditions don’t allow you the surrender; you have to drop conditions. You have to say, ‘Whatsoever happens, I am going to enjoy. I am going to enjoy unconditionally.’\nYou are in love with a woman or with a man, and immediately a thousand and one conditions are there: ‘I will love only if these things are fulfilled – that you will not look at anybody with loving eyes. Then I will love you.’ Now, nobody can promise it. And even if one promises it, nobody can keep it. You are asking something absurd. If some beautiful man passes by, how is your woman not going to look at him – how? She may not look, she may close her eyes, she may look somewhere else – but she has looked at the man. In that moment she had moved, her heart had missed a beat.\nHow are you going to avoid? There are so many beautiful women in the world. You can at the most pretend. So all conditions create pretensions, because all conditions are unnatural.\nA man who really wants to live, lives unconditionally; he doesn’t make requirements of life. He says, ‘Whatsoever comes, I am going to dance. Whatsoever the situation, I am going to dance. I am going to live it, I am going into it with my whole being.’ Then the fear of life will disappear. Lived, there is no fear. Unlived, life creates fear.\nLet me repeat: Because you are not living life, that’s why the fear. And the life is disappearing, and you are wasting a great opportunity. And the opportunity may not come ever again. Or even if it comes, will you be able to do something else? You will repeat the same. You have been repeating – it is not the only life that you have come to, you have been through many lives. You have lived for eternity, in a thousand and one forms, and always you have been missing. And you have been missing because of your conditions.\nSee to it that conditions are dropped. That you love for the sheer joy of love and that you live for the sheer joy of living. Be a hedonist. Be an Epicurean. To me, Epicurus is on the right track towards the Garden of Eden – his commune was called ‘The Garden’. He has been immensely misunderstood. I know there is something even beyond Epicurus, but it goes through him. You will have to pass through the Garden of Epicurus, only then will you reach to the shrine of Buddha – otherwise not.\nHedonism is beautiful – eat, drink, and be merry – but it is not the whole story. It is just the beginning, the porch of the palace. There is far more, far beyond it, far more to life. But you have to pass through the porch. And your so-called religions have taught you to be anti-hedonistic – that’s why the fear. Your religions have taught you misery. They talk of bliss but they create misery. They go on preaching to you how to be blissful, but whatsoever they do and whatsoever methods they supply are self-destructive. They don’t allow you really to be blissful.\nBe happy here. And remember, I am not saying this is all to life. Epicurus is the beginning of a Buddha. You can stop at Epicurus, then you will miss much. But it is better to stop at Epicurus than not to enter into Epicurus at all. Because then you miss all. I teach you spiritual hedonism – that is my message to you. First be hedonistic as far as the first body is concerned. Then be hedonistic as far as the second body is concerned. And then be hedonistic totally in the third body.\nBuddha is orgasmic. But you have to learn the orgasm from the physical, you have to go from abe. There are people who want to jump to xyz – and they don’t know anything about abc. They have not yet even learned how to live in the body in the world, and they want to live in Heaven. They will not be able to live there, it will be impossible. Just think of yourself – if you are by accident welcomed into Heaven, what will you do there? You will be as miserable as you are here – maybe more miserable, because there life will be more thrilling. There will be more exploration, more love, more intensity in everything. There will be more PASSION – what will you do there? You have not been able even to live on this earth – which knows passion, which knows love, which knows joy, but in moderate quantities. In Heaven there are no limits. Heaven knows no moderation – it is excess, it is ecstasy.\nStart learning how to be unconditional. For small conditions people miss much. Just a small thing can destroy their whole joy – and they don’t even see the proportion of it. A man has just said something to you, it hurts. And the man has always been beautiful and you have loved the man – but he has just uttered a word, and it hurts, and the friendship is broken. You don’t know the joy of friendship, otherwise you would not have broken it for such a small thing – for trivia. You have been living with your wife beautifully, and just a small thing, just a small negativity from her, and bridges are broken and you start thinking of divorce.\nPetty things, meaningless things, go on destroying. And because you can’t live, naturally you are afraid of life.\nYOU SAY: WHY DO I SEEM TO FEEL MORE AFRAID OF LIFE THAN OF DEATH?\nThen there is one thing more: Life requires more than death will ever require. Life requires a willing surrender. Death does not care for you. It simply comes, without any notification even. It simply comes and takes you away, it drags you You are not asked, your cooperation is not asked. Death pays no respect to you, and gives not even a single moment’s time to prepare. It happens. Life is more respectful towards you – it gives you time, it gives you freedom to choose, it gives you opportunities to cooperate or not to cooperate.\nHence the fear. The fear of life is really fear of your own self. You know yourself, that you are going to miss. Knowing yourself the way you are, your fear is perfectly on the right track. It says the way you are, you are going to miss. Life will bring a challenge and you will shrink.\nJust few days before, a young man came to me from the West. I was looking into his head and into his heart – his heart was ready for sannyas but his head was not ready. Now I was really confused by him – what to do? Should I give him sannyas? His heart is saying yes. A great pulsation in the heart, the heart is simply crying for it. And the head goes on saying no. It is as if you are on a crossroad and the red and the green, both lights, go on. And it is very difficult to decide whether to pass or not to pass – one light says one thing, another light says another just the opposite.\nI tried to persuade him, I tried to seduce him towards his heart. But the more I tried, the more he became stubborn – the more the head became stubborn. The heart was joyous. When I was trying to persuade him to take the jump, the heart was taking such leaps of joy. The heart was becoming a big flame, it was almost tangible. Anybody who has eyes could have seen it? the heart was aflame. But the head was becoming darker and darker.\nNow an opportunity. a challenge is there. I am the challenge in that moment for him, life is coming through me in that moment. Sannyas is the challenge to surrender, sannyas is the challenge to explore something new that you have not known before. The head never knows anything new. The head is always borrowed, the head knows only things from others. It is second-hand, it is never original – it can’t be original. It collects rubbish. But it feels secure, it feels logical.\nThe heart is illogical. And you are afraid to go with the heart, you don’t know where it will land you. The head moves on the superhighway, the heart will drag you into some labyrinth in the jungle of life – you will be alone there. The head always lives with the crowd – it is communist, it is fascist. it is Catholic, it is Protestant, it is Hindu, it is Mohammedan. The head is part of the crowd. The heart makes you alone – you are neither a Christian nor a Hindu nor a Mohammedan. Suddenly you are alone. the whole crowd has disappeared, you start feeling afraid. And life comes only when you are alone. When you take hold of your life in your own hands, when you are no more part of an insane crowd. when you are no more part of this pathological world. But then you have to be alone, and in aloneness there is fear.\nWhen a challenge like love or sannyas or samadhi or God provokes you, you feel as if death is coming close by. It is a sort of death. YoU will have to die to the past, to the old; only then can you be reborn to the new. Fear grips you. You say, ‘I w ill have to think.’ That’s what that young man said: ‘I will have to think. I will have to wait.’\nThinking can never lead you into the new. Logic can never give you any new conclusions, it goes on repeating the same. Logic is vicious, circular, it moves in the same rut. Whatsoever conclusions come through logic were already in the premise, they are not new. Maybe now they are more articulate, that’s all, but they were given in the first premise.\nOnly love – and love means illogical, paradoxical – takes you to new conclusions. Because love knows how to take a leap. Logic is continuous with the past, it knows no leap. Love knows leaps, quantam leaps. It can jump from the old to the new, with no bridge in-between. Love can give you a discontinuity with the past. But then there is fear. And love is very life – if you miss love you will miss life, and then there will be fear that ‘I am missing.’\nYou are missing because you have not been able to allow your heart. You are continuously controlling through the head. The ‘heady’ people always miss. Get deeper into your being, move towards the heart. And the heart is not the ultimate, you have to move even deeper than the heart. And then you come to your navel – what the Japanese call ‘hara’. These are the three centers: hara – two inches below the navel; heart, and head. The head is the farthestmost boundary-line – when you are farthest from your being, you are in the head. When you are close to your being, you are in the heart. When you are at the very core of being, you are in the hara.\nAnd only through the hara, fear disappears. Only through the hara do you live for the first time authentically, sincerely, with no fear. And that life needs to be lived. That life can be lived only if\nyou don’t divide existence into two – body/mind, matter/soul, God/existence. If you divide, you will remain in the intellect. Drop all divisions, live as one. All the three bodies have to be lived as one. They are three aspects of your being – the physical body, the bliss body and the Buddha body. And I am not against any – I am not saying choose the Buddha body against the physical body. If you choose the Buddha body against the physical body, your Buddhahood will miss something, will lack something. It will not be perfect, it will not be the total flowering.\nWhen you don’t reject anything, when your acceptance is utter, then you bloom. Then you bloom into a thousand-petalled lotus, SAHASRAR.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2\nBELOVED OSHO, SINCE FALLING IN LOVE, EVEN THOUGH HAVING LITTLE TO DO WITH HIM, IT SEEMS ENTIRELY MY OWN JOURNEY. FEELING NOURISHED AND MUCH POWER IN MY BEING.\nThe question is from Anand Amrita.\nLove IS nourishment. Love is exactly like food to the soul. Food is nourishment for the body, love is nourishment for the soul. Without for you will die physically, without love you will die spiritually – in fact you will not even be horn. The body needs food, the soul needs love.\nAnd Jesus is right when he says, ‘Man cannot live by bread alone.’ Because the bread is bread only for the body. You will have to seek and search something which nourishes your soul. So, Amrita, be always in love. And remember one thing: Lovers don’t matter, love matters. If one lover disappears from your life, don’t become sour and bitter. If one lover has moved away from you, don’t go on clinging to the past and the memory and the nostalgia of it. That is sacrilegious, that is insulting to love. The lover is good, but the lover is good because of love. You need not sacrifice love for the lover. Lovers come and go, love remains.\nWhen one lover has gone out of your life, don’t become poisoned by it, don’t start closing your heart. You have to live, you have to still be in love. One should always be in love – with whom is immaterial. If love goes on flowing, you will be nourished in your soul.\nBut there are people who make this condition too. They become too much attached to the lover. It is as if a flute-player has become too much attached to his flute and he cannot play on another flute. And this flute has been stolen, is broken, now he will never sing. Now he will never sing – because that flute is no more with him, how can he sing? It will be a betrayal to that flute. This is foolish but this is how humanity has been taught. If that flute is gone, search and seek for another flute. Because your devotion should be towards the song, not towards the flute. The flute is just a vehicle, a passage.\nSo are all lovers. If one love is no more there, start searching, exploring, for another. Remain always in love, and your soul will grow, will be nourished.\nBut people become obsessed. Obsession is pathological. Because of obsession the world suffers too much. A few people suffer because they cannot love, and a few people suffer because they have loved, but all suffer all the same. Nothing is, and can be, eternal here; all is momentary. Our meeting is momentary, all meetings are momentary. It is a miracle that they happen – that you fall in love with a man or a woman or with a friend. It is a miracle that it has happened – be grateful to God, but don’t take it for granted. Nothing can be taken for granted. It will disappear one day, as it has appeared.\nIt is like a rose flower. In the morning it was there, by the evening it is gone. And the rose flower is far more beautiful because it will disappear. If it was going to be there for ever and ever like a plastic flower, there would not have been any beauty. The very possibility of its disappearance makes it immensely valuable. So if you are in love with a person, remember the rose flower. Love is a rose flower – it is there, but it is not like a thing. It is very fragile. It is more like a fragrance – it has come to you on the wings of the wind, the wind may take it away again. It is a gift out of the blue. You cannot cling to it, you cannot possess it. If you try to possess it, you will kill it immediately.\nSo a few people start possessing and kill. And a few people don’t possess, but when the lover has gone or has moved away, has taken his path separate from your path. then you are full of tears for ever. Just crying for the spilt milk. Don’t cry for the spilt milk. Go ahead, search and seek again, God will come in some other form. Somewhere else another bush may have bloomed. And who knows ’ A bigger rose flower may be waiting for you.\nRemain always in love, never betray love. Lovers come and go. Trust love that it will happen again, that again you will be dancing and singing. Trust life, trust love. And it IS nourishment, it is alchemy. It is love that one is born through, it is through love that one becomes again and again fresh, is rejuvenated. Again and again feels enthusiasm for life, again and again feels celebration of life, again and again feels grateful to God.\nPeople whose loves have disappeared, whose hearts have become without love, are like wasteland, are like deserts. They can pray but their prayer will not have any beat to it. They can pray but their prayer will lose all meaning. They can pray but their prayer will not have any juice to it. It will be dry, it will be dust – it cannot relate to God.\nThe day you stop relating with people, you stop relating with existence. People are the closest existence to you. Relate to people, relate to trees, relate to birds and animals and rocks, and only then will you be able to relate to God. Love is the way.\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3\nOSHO, I BELIEVE THAT NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT IT?\nThen try to strike a match on a cake of soap. The fourth question:\nQuestion 4\nOSHO: THE FOURTH WAY, AS TAUGHT BY GURDJIEFF, HAS BEEN CALLED THE WAY OF CONSCIENCE. WHAT PLACE HAS CONSCIENCE IN YOUR TEACHING?\nThe question is from Cecil Lewis.\nNo place at all. I don’t believe in conscience, I believe only in consciousness. I don’t believe in morality, I believe only in religion. I am amoral.\nConscience is a trick of the society played upon you. The society creates conscience so that you may never need consciousness. You have been deceived. For example, when Jesus says ‘Love is God’ it is not out of his conscience, it is out of his consciousness. He knows it. It is not a belief, it is his experience. When a Christian says ‘Love is God’ it is his conscience, not his consciousness. He has not known it, he has not lived it. He has only heard it repeated again and again – he has become hypnotized by it.\nEach child is being hypnotized by the parents, the priests, the politicians, the society. Constant repetition of a certain thing becomes conscience. You go on teaching to the child, ‘This is right. This is right. This is right.’ Hearing it again and again, his mind is being conditioned. After many years he will also say ‘This is right’ – it will be automatic. It will not be from his own being, it will come from the gramophone record that the society has placed in his being. It is like an electrode of Delgado. It is the dangerous trick that the society has been playing on everybody, down the centuries.\nThat’s why there are so many consciences in the world – the Hindu has one type of conscience, the Mohammedan has another type of conscience. How can consciences be so many? Truth is one. And consciences are so many?\nFrom my childhood I was taught a very very strict vegetarianism. I was born in a Jaina family, absolutely dogmatic about vegetarianism. Not even tomatoes were allowed in my house, because tomatoes look a little like red meat. Poor innocent tomatoes, they were not allowed. Nobody has ever heard of anybody eating in the night; the sunset was the last limit. For eighteen years I had not eaten anything in the night, it was a great sin.\nThen for the first time I went on a picnic with a few friends to the mountains. And they were all Hindus and I was the only Jaina. And they were not worried to cook in the day. Mm? The mountains were so beautiful and there was so much tO explore – so they didn’t bother about cooking at all, they cooked in the night. Now it was a great problem for me to eat or not to eat? And I was feeling really hungry. The whole day moving in the mountains, it had been arduous. And I was really feeling hungry – for the first time so hungry in my life.\nAnd then they started cooking. And the aroma and the food smell. And I was just sitting there, a Jaina. Now it was too difficult for me – what to do? The idea of eating in the night was impossible – the whole conditioning of eighteen years. And to sleep in that kind of hunger was impossible. And then they all started persuading me. And they said, ‘There is nobody here to know that you have eaten, and we will not tell your family at all. Don’t be worried.’ And I was ready to be seduced, so they seduced me and I ate. But then I could not sleep – I had to vomit two or three times in the night, the whole night became nightmarish. It would have been better if I had not eaten.\nConditioning for eighteen years that to eat in the night is sin. Now nobody else was vomiting, they were all fast asleep and snoring. They have all committed sin and they are all sleeping perfectly well. And they have been committing the sin for eighteen years, and I have committed it for the first time and I am being punished. This seems unjust!\nConscience is created; it is a conditioning. All that you think is good or bad is nothing but a conditioning. But this conditioning can go on managing your whole life. The society has entered in you and controls you from there, from within. It has become your inner voice. And because it has become your inner voice, you cannot hear your REAL inner voice. So my suggestion is: Unburden yourself of conscience. Throw all the conditioning OUt, cathart it, be free from it. That’s what I mean when I say don’t be a Christian, a Hindu, a Jaina, a Buddhist.\nJust be. And be alert. In that alertness you will always know what is right and what is wrong. And the right and the wrong is not a fixed thing – something may be right in the morning and may be wrong in the evening, and something may be wrong in the evening and may be right in the night. Circumstances change. An alert man, a conscious man, has no fixed ideas. He has spontaneous responses but no fixed ideas. Because of fixed ideas you never act spontaneously. Your action is always a kind of reaction – not action really.\nWhen you act out of spontaneity, with no idea, with no prejudice, then there is real action. And action has passion in it, intensity in it. And it is original and it is first-hand. And action makes your life creative and action makes your life continuously a celebration. Because each act becomes an expression of your being. Conscience is a false being.\nI think the French language is the only language which has only one word for consciousness and conscience – a single word, meaning both. That is beautiful. Real conscience should be only consciousness, nothing else. You should become more conscious.\nBut about consciousness also, I have differences with George Gurdjieff. When he says ‘Be conscious’ he says ‘Be conscious that you ARE.’ He insists for self-remembering. Now, this has to be understood. Your consciousness has two polarities. One polarity is the content. For example, a cloud of anger is inside you – that is the content. And you are aware of the cloud of anger – that is consciousness, the witness, watchfulness, the observer. So your consciousness can be divided in two – the observer and the observed.\nGurdjieff says: Go on remembering the observer – self-remembering. Buddha says: Forget the observer, just watch the observed. And if you have to choose between Buddha and Gurdjieff, I will suggest choose Buddha. Because there is a danger with Gurdjieff you may become too self- conscious – rather than becoming self-aware, you may become self-conscious. You may become an egoist. And that I have felt in many Gurdjieff disciples – they have become very very great egoists. Not that Gurdjieff was an egoist – he was one of the rarest enlightened men of this age. But the method has a danger in it: it is very difficult to make a distinction between self-consciousness and self-remembering. It is almost impossible to make the distinction, it is so subtle. And for the ignorant masses it is almost always self-consciousness that will take possession of them; it will not be self-remembering.\nThe very word ‘self’ is dangerous – you become more and more settled in the idea of the self. And the idea of the self isolates you from existence.\nBuddha says: Forget the self, because there is no self. The self is just in the grammar, in the language; it is not anything existential. You just observe the content. By observing the content, the content starts disappearing. Once the content disappears, watch your anger – and watching it, you will see it is disappearing. Once the anger has disappeared there is silence. There is no self, no observer, and nothing to be observed. There is silence. This silence is brought by VIPASSANA, Buddha’s method of awareness.\nOrdinary man does both. He goes on changing his gear – sometimes he observes the self, sometimes he observes the content. He goes on moving from this tO that, he is a constant wavering. Gurdjieff says the one thing is: Be settled in the observer. Buddha says: Look at the observed.\nMy own approach is different from both. My approach is that Gurdjieff’s method is more dangerous than Buddha’s method, but even in Buddha’s method there is bound to be some tension – the effort to watch. The very effort to watch will make you tense.\nA Buddhist monk was brought to me from Ceylon. He was unable to sleep – for three years he had not slept. And all kinds of medications had been tried upon him but nothing was helping, no tranquillizer was of any help. And nobody had bothered that he goes on doing VIPASSANA, the Buddha’s method of insight – nobody had thought about it. When he came to me, the first thing I asked him was, ‘Are you doing VIPASSANA? – because he is a Buddhist monk, he must be doing it. He said, ’Yes – for three years.’ I said, ‘Then that is the cause of your sleeplessness.’\nIf you are continuously making effort to watch, then in the night you will not be able to relax and fall into sleep – the watching will become continuous. And if you are watching even in the night, how can you fall asleep? You cannot relax, the tension has become fixed. It is a known fact that Buddhist monks sleep only three, four hours at the most. It is not a gain. They think, and others also think, that this is a gain – they have attained something, they sleep only three, four hours. It is not. They are losing something very valuable – relaxation. And they will look tense, on their faces they will look tense. They will look very quiet, but tense. They will look very silent – but their silence is not the silence of relaxation, but of effort. You can see the effort in the comer, defining them.\nMy own method is: You relax. Neither watch the watcher nor watch the watched. Just relax, be passive. If something floats and you cannot help seeing it, see it. But don’t make any effort to see it deliberately. If you are relaxed like a mirror, if some cloud passes by, it will be reflected. Be like a mirror – lucid, passive. Drop both – the Gurdjieffian method of self-remembering, and the Buddhist method of watching.\nBut if you have to choose between Gurdjieff and Buddha, choose Buddha. If you have to choose between Buddha and me, choose me.\nRelax. And just see things. And there is nothing much – if you miss something, it is not of worth. You can miss, you are allowed to miss. Take life easy, take it easy.\nSo people who have been in some kind of effort – and Gurdjieff’s work is of great effort – will be puzzled here. That’s why Lewis is puzzled, a little bit confused. And sooner or later, either he has to understand me or he has to condemn me – both are open. And condemnation will be easier. Because for thirty yeas working hard – and now sud-denly he has become attracted to a man who\ndoes not believe in effort at all. Who does not believe in improvement, who does not believe in growth, who does not believe in going anywhere, who does not believe in any WAY.\nHe says, THE FOURTH WAY, AS TAUGHT BY GURDJIEFF.\nWhat I am teaching here is: No Way. There is really no way, because truth is not a goal. All ways lead away from where we are. All roads, all ways, all paths, distract you from truth. And there is nowhere to go, either. And nobody to go. There is no way of being here and now but to be here and now. When I say ‘Be here and now’ don’t ask how – the ‘how’ will take you away. When I say ‘Be here and now’ don’t ask ‘What is the way to be here and now?’ There is no way of being here and now but to BE here and now. There is no way to be still, and no need of any way. To see, wholly to see, that there is no way, is at once to be still. Seeing that, is stillness. All ways lead everywhere but here.\nTo live one’s life as it comes and goes, is awareness. Passive, lucid, mirror-like, with no tension. So I don’t teach you attention, because attention has the word ‘tension’ in it. And the phenomenon of attention has the feeling of tension in it – hence the word ‘attention’. Enjoy, relax. Just understanding this, that there is nowhere to go, is liberation. Liberation is not like a goal somewhere else waiting for you. Liberation is understanding that you are already liberated.\nIt is impious for us to assert so flatly what should be, in the face of what is. What is, is the truth. YATHA BHUTAM – that which is is the truth. To assert what should be, is impious, sacrilegious, it is a sin. ‘Should’ is a sin. That which is – relax with it, float with it. I don’t teach even swimming, I simply say float with it. It is our responsibility to know how to accept and live through that which is.\nSo I don’t teach any way – fourth or fifth or sixth. And I don’t teach conscience, I teach a lucid relaxed consciousness. Out of that, many flowerings happen. Out of that, many songs are born. But they are born on their own. You cannot be the doer of them and you cannot feel enhanced that ‘I have done’. You cannot feel your ego fulfilled through them. The more those flowers will come, the more you will disappear. And one day there is flowering, but you are not. That is the day, the moment, of liberation.\nThe fifth question:\nQuestion 5\nI WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE.\nThen first take sannyas. And you may not need to commit suicide, because sannyas is the greatest suicide possible.\nAnd why should one want to commit suicide? Death is coming on its own – why are you in such a hurry? Death will come, it always comes. Even if you don’t want it to come, it comes. You need not go to meet it, it comes uninvited.\nBut you must be missing your life badly. It is out of anger, out of desperation, that you want to commit suicide. I will teach you the real suicide: Become a sannyasin. And the ordinary suicide will-not help\nmuch, you will be born immediately into some other womb somewhere. Some foolish couple will be making love somewhere, remember...and you will be trapped again. You cannot escape so easily – there are fools and fools. Before you will be escaping from this body you will be caught in another net. And again you will have to go to the school and the college and the university – just think of that! Think of all those miserable experiences – that will prevent you from committing suicide.\nYou know, Indians don’t commit suicide so easily, because they know that they will be born again. In the West, much suicide and the suicidal idea exists; many people commit suicide. And psychoanalysts say there are very very rare people who don’t think of committing it. In fact one person has investigated and gathered data, and he says every person, every single person, thinks at least four times in his life to commit suicide. But he must be thinking of the West. In the East, because of the idea of reincarnation, nobody wants to commit suicide – what is the point? You escape from this door and from another door you are in again. You can’t go so easily.\nI will teach you real suicide, you can go for ever. That’s what it means to become a Buddha – to go for ever. When somebody used to commit this suicide in samadhi, Buddha had a special name for him, he would call him ANAGAMI – one who will not return. One who has gone to the farthest shore and will not be coming back. I can make you anagami, a non-returner. Then no womb can be a trap for you again.\nWhy do you want to commit suicide? Maybe life is not going the way you want it to go? But who are you to impose your way on life, your will on life? Maybe your desires are not fulfilled? But then drop desires! Why drop yourself? Maybe your expectations are not fulfilled, and you are feeling frustrated? In frustration one wants to destroy. And there are only two possibilities – either murder somebody or murder yourself. Murdering somebody else is more dangerous, so people start thinking of murdering themselves. But it is murder.\nWhy not change your life rather than destroying it? And please don’t commit it here, otherwise you will create problems for me.\nI have heard:\nA policeman saw a man standing on the parapet of Blackfriars Bridge one evening, obviously about to jump. Rushing over to him, he tried to talk him out of it. ‘If you jump, sir,’ he said, ‘it will be my duty to jump in after you to try to rescue you. Then I’ll get wet, catch pneumonia, and die too. So why don’t you just go home quietly and put your head in the gas oven?’\nPlease don’t create any trouble here. And don’t talk about it, because there are many people who would like the idea – you may convert a few people.\nI have heard:\nA man was walking across Waterloo Bridge late one night when he noticed another man on the parapet about to throw himself over. He rushed up to the would-be suicide and shouted, ‘Wait a minute! Don’t jump! Come and have a drink and talk things over.’\nThe two men went off to a nearby pub and spent the next hour chatting over the state of the country, inflation, taxes, and the future of Western civilization. Then they finished their drinks, walked back to Waterloo Bridge, and both jumped.\nSo don’t spread this idea here. If you want to commit suicide just come in the evening to darshan and I will help\nThe seventh question:\nQuestion 6\nI LOVE ORDINARY LIFE. IT IS LIKE DAYTIME IN WHICH I FEEL MORE AND MORE AWAKE. BUT I OFTEN HAVE THE SENSE THAT THERE IS A UNIVERSE OF MYSTERIES THAT BELONGS IN DARKNESS AND IS UNAVAILABLE TO ME. ESOTERIC TEACHINGS, SYMBOLS, ‘HIGHER KNOWLEDGE’, SEEM TO POINT TO THESE MYSTERIES, BUT I CAN NEVER GET INTERESTED IN THE BOOKS. I WOULD RATHER JOURNEY INTO THE NIGHT. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS PLEASE?\nThe question is from Anand Rajen.\nRajen, there is no other life than this ordinary life. Because people are incapable of living this ordinary life, they invent esoteric things. These are the people who are incapable of living – they distract their minds and beings. All esoteric teachings and all hidden teachings and all those so- called mysteries are just mumbo-jumbo.\nThe mystery is here. The mystery is in the trees and in the rocks and in the birds. The mystery is in people – in you, in me. The mystery is in relating, the mystery is in singing, the mystery is in dancing, the mystery is in love, the mystery is in prayer. Avoid all that nonsense literature which goes on in the name of esotericism. It is pathological. These are the people who are incapable of tasting this life. They have to find some excuses, alibis, to avoid this life. They cannot enjoy, they cannot be passionately in it. They don’t have passion, they don’t have intensity of life, they don’t know how to live. They have forgotten all – how to be natural and spontaneous. Now they have to find some way to pretend that this life is not worth living, the grapes are sour – there are other grapes, hidden grapes, which only they know and their inner circle knows.\nTheosophy and anthroposophy and masonic lodges – and all kinds of nonsense goes on. Avoid it, it is against life. This is the only life there is, the only dance there is. The real enlightened people have known this life’s extraordinariness.\nA man asked a Zen master: ‘Since you have become enlightened what changes happen in your life?’ The master said: ‘Before I became enlightened I used to chop wood and carry water from the well.’ And the man asked: ‘Now that you have become enlightened what do you do? What changes have happened?’ He said: ‘I chop wood and I carry water from the well.’ But the man was puzzled. ‘Then,’ he said, ‘what is the difference? It is the same thing.’\nAnd the master laughed. He said, ‘It is not the same thing. Before, I used to chop wood and think a thousand and one thoughts. Now I simply chop wood. It is so beautiful just to chop wood and do nothing. Before, I used to have a thousand and one desires while drawing water from the well. Now I simply draw water. And to tell you the truth, there is no one inside me who is drawing the water. And when I am chopping the wood it is wonderful, because there is nobody in me chopping the wood. I have disappeared! The wood is being chopped and the water is being carried, and it is tremendously beautiful.’\nThe ordinary life becomes extraordinary if you live it totally, fully. Avoid esotericism. They are dangerous things, you can become hooked into them. And then you will be just in mind-trips, imagination. If you love imagination it is okay, if you love fantasizing it is okay. You can create your own planes and your own astral travels and subtle bodies and whatsoever you want.\nA young woman dreamt that the prince charming had come on his horse. A beautiful horse and the beautiful prince – and she has been waiting for this prince charming for ever and ever, and he has come. When you wait too much, beware – it happens. And the prince took the woman on the horse and the horse started galloping towards some unknown destination. And the woman was thrilled – who would not be thrilled? And she asked the prince, ‘Where are you taking me?’ And the prince said, ‘This is your dream. So you say to me where you want to be taken. This is your dream.’\nIn these so-called esoteric trips, wherever you are going it is your dream. Masters will appear – Kuthumi and KH – and automatic handwriting will appear, and messages will be received from the beyond. And all sheer nonsense. Eat your breakfast and have a good sleep.\nThe eighth question:\nQuestion 7\nWHY DO PERSONS LIKE BUDDHA OR CHRIST APPEAR ONLY AT CERTAIN TIMES?\nBecause they are afraid of you. They think a lot before they gather enough courage to come back to this earth to be crucified by you again, to be stoned by you again.\nAnd sometimes, even if they come, they live here anonymously. So that you cannot stone and you cannot crucify them. And then, everything happens in its own time. When the spring comes trees will bloom, and when the right time has come the fruits will ripen. Every moment things are happening, but never anything happens for which the moment has not come. Everything has its own time, and it is good.\nOn the planet Volcanus, the gases from the many volcanoes which supplied the nuclear lighting were running out. It was a race against time to find another way of lighting the planet.\nSuddenly they were plunged into total darkness.\nThe people of Volcanus were terrified. Just then they heard a slippery slurpery noise, and rays of light appeared at the top of all volcanoes. The lights got brighter and brighter, lighting the whole of the planet.\n‘We are saved,’ shouted the people. ‘The glow worms from inside the volcanoes are giving us the light we need.’\nThe glow worms got closer.\n‘But why haven’t you shone before?’ asked the people.\n‘We weren’t needed,’ said the leader of the glow worms. ‘But when the planet was plunged into total darkness, we decided that the time was right. Because...when you gotta glow you gotta glow.’\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7644","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/this_very_body_the_buddha/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/this_very_body_the_buddha/>This Very Body the Buddha</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">4 On the Wings of the Wind</h1><div class=post-meta>36 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7644 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/This_Very_Body_the_Buddha/part4.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

You cannot be really afraid of that with which you
are not at all acquainted. Fear is a relationship – you have to know
something to be afraid of it. Nobody really is afraid of death. And
whenever somebody says ‘I am afraid of death’ he is simply saying that
he is afraid to lose life. Death is absolutely unknown. So everybody is
afraid of life – it is life that is the problem, not death. It is life
that gives you anguish and nights without sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>And what is the fear of life? There are many fears but they can be
reduced to a few basic fears. One is that life is slipping by and you
have not lived yet. That’s the panic, basic panic – that life is going
out of your hands, every moment you have less and less life. And you
have not lived yet. Great fear arises: are you going to miss? Will you
be able to make it this time? And who knows? There may be no other time.
Life may not happen again – who knows? This seems to be the only life,
and every day it is turning into a wasteland. Hence the fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, it is life that ultimately brings death. Death is the
crescendo of life, the finishing touch. If you are afraid of death, that
too is basically fear of life – that life will bring death one day. That
the trees will be there and the flowers will be there and the spring
will come and the grass will be green and you will not be here.</p><p>And while you are here you are not much here either. And sooner or
later, grass will be growing on your grave. And you will not be able to
walk on it. And while you can walk on it and enjoy the feel of it and
the dewdrops and the coolness and the sunlit morning, you are not
enjoying it. Because you cannot enjoy, that’s why you are afraid of
life. And life is turning into death, the unknown. The known is always
disappearing into the unknown. The light is always disappearing into
darkness.</p><p><br></p><p>So life will take you one day to the door of death. But why are you
not living? What hinders you from living? You have conditions, that’s
what is hindering. You have conditions – that ‘If THIS happens, only
then will I be happy.’ And life is not going to oblige you. You have to
surrender to life. Your conditions don’t allow you the surrender; you
have to drop conditions. You have to say, ‘Whatsoever happens, I am
going to enjoy. I am going to enjoy unconditionally.’</p><p><br></p><p>You are in love with a woman or with a man, and immediately a
thousand and one conditions are there: ‘I will love only if these things
are fulfilled – that you will not look at anybody with loving eyes. Then
I will love you.’ Now, nobody can promise it. And even if one promises
it, nobody can keep it. You are asking something absurd. If some
beautiful man passes by, how is your woman not going to look at him –
how? She may not look, she may close her eyes, she may look somewhere
else – but she has looked at the man. In that moment she had moved, her
heart had missed a beat.</p><p><br></p><p>How are you going to avoid? There are so many beautiful women in the
world. You can at the most pretend. So all conditions create
pretensions, because all conditions are unnatural.</p><p><br></p><p>A man who really wants to live, lives unconditionally; he doesn’t
make requirements of life. He says, ‘Whatsoever comes, I am going to
dance. Whatsoever the situation, I am going to dance. I am going to live
it, I am going into it with my whole being.’ Then the fear of life will
disappear. Lived, there is no fear. Unlived, life creates fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me repeat: Because you are not living life, that’s why the fear.
And the life is disappearing, and you are wasting a great opportunity.
And the opportunity may not come ever again. Or even if it comes, will
you be able to do something else? You will repeat the same. You have
been repeating – it is not the only life that you have come to, you have
been through many lives. You have lived for eternity, in a thousand and
one forms, and always you have been missing. And you have been missing
because of your conditions.</p><p><br></p><p>See to it that conditions are dropped. That you love for the sheer
joy of love and that you live for the sheer joy of living. Be a
hedonist. Be an Epicurean. To me, Epicurus is on the right track towards
the Garden of Eden – his commune was called ‘The Garden’. He has been
immensely misunderstood. I know there is something even beyond Epicurus,
but it goes through him. You will have to pass through the Garden of
Epicurus, only then will you reach to the shrine of Buddha – otherwise
not.</p><p><br></p><p>Hedonism is beautiful – eat, drink, and be merry – but it is not the
whole story. It is just the beginning, the porch of the palace. There is
far more, far beyond it, far more to life. But you have to pass through
the porch. And your so-called religions have taught you to be
anti-hedonistic – that’s why the fear. Your religions have taught you
misery. They talk of bliss but they create misery. They go on preaching
to you how to be blissful, but whatsoever they do and whatsoever methods
they supply are self-destructive. They don’t allow you really to be
blissful.</p><p>Be happy here. And remember, I am not saying this is all to life.
Epicurus is the beginning of a Buddha. You can stop at Epicurus, then
you will miss much. But it is better to stop at Epicurus than not to
enter into Epicurus at all. Because then you miss all. I teach you
spiritual hedonism – that is my message to you. First be hedonistic as
far as the first body is concerned. Then be hedonistic as far as the
second body is concerned. And then be hedonistic totally in the third
body.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha is orgasmic. But you have to learn the orgasm from the
physical, you have to go from abe. There are people who want to jump to
xyz – and they don’t know anything about abc. They have not yet even
learned how to live in the body in the world, and they want to live in
Heaven. They will not be able to live there, it will be impossible. Just
think of yourself – if you are by accident welcomed into Heaven, what
will you do there? You will be as miserable as you are here – maybe more
miserable, because there life will be more thrilling. There will be more
exploration, more love, more intensity in everything. There will be more
PASSION – what will you do there? You have not been able even to live on
this earth – which knows passion, which knows love, which knows joy, but
in moderate quantities. In Heaven there are no limits. Heaven knows no
moderation – it is excess, it is ecstasy.</p><p><br></p><p>Start learning how to be unconditional. For small conditions people
miss much. Just a small thing can destroy their whole joy – and they
don’t even see the proportion of it. A man has just said something to
you, it hurts. And the man has always been beautiful and you have loved
the man – but he has just uttered a word, and it hurts, and the
friendship is broken. You don’t know the joy of friendship, otherwise
you would not have broken it for such a small thing – for trivia. You
have been living with your wife beautifully, and just a small thing,
just a small negativity from her, and bridges are broken and you start
thinking of divorce.</p><p><br></p><p>Petty things, meaningless things, go on destroying. And because you
can’t live, naturally you are afraid of life.</p><p><br></p><p>YOU SAY: WHY DO I SEEM TO FEEL MORE AFRAID OF LIFE THAN OF DEATH?</p><p><br></p><p>Then there is one thing more: Life requires more than death will ever
require. Life requires a willing surrender. Death does not care for you.
It simply comes, without any notification even. It simply comes and
takes you away, it drags you You are not asked, your cooperation is not
asked. Death pays no respect to you, and gives not even a single
moment’s time to prepare. It happens. Life is more respectful towards
you – it gives you time, it gives you freedom to choose, it gives you
opportunities to cooperate or not to cooperate.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence the fear. The fear of life is really fear of your own self. You
know yourself, that you are going to miss. Knowing yourself the way you
are, your fear is perfectly on the right track. It says the way you are,
you are going to miss. Life will bring a challenge and you will
shrink.</p><p><br></p><p>Just few days before, a young man came to me from the West. I was
looking into his head and into his heart – his heart was ready for
sannyas but his head was not ready. Now I was really confused by him –
what to do? Should I give him sannyas? His heart is saying yes. A great
pulsation in the heart, the heart is simply crying for it. And the head
goes on saying no. It is as if you are on a crossroad and the red and
the green, both lights, go on. And it is very difficult to decide
whether to pass or not to pass – one light says one thing, another light
says another just the opposite.</p><p>I tried to persuade him, I tried to seduce him towards his heart. But
the more I tried, the more he became stubborn – the more the head became
stubborn. The heart was joyous. When I was trying to persuade him to
take the jump, the heart was taking such leaps of joy. The heart was
becoming a big flame, it was almost tangible. Anybody who has eyes could
have seen it? the heart was aflame. But the head was becoming darker and
darker.</p><p><br></p><p>Now an opportunity. a challenge is there. I am the challenge in that
moment for him, life is coming through me in that moment. Sannyas is the
challenge to surrender, sannyas is the challenge to explore something
new that you have not known before. The head never knows anything new.
The head is always borrowed, the head knows only things from others. It
is second-hand, it is never original – it can’t be original. It collects
rubbish. But it feels secure, it feels logical.</p><p><br></p><p>The heart is illogical. And you are afraid to go with the heart, you
don’t know where it will land you. The head moves on the superhighway,
the heart will drag you into some labyrinth in the jungle of life – you
will be alone there. The head always lives with the crowd – it is
communist, it is fascist. it is Catholic, it is Protestant, it is Hindu,
it is Mohammedan. The head is part of the crowd. The heart makes you
alone – you are neither a Christian nor a Hindu nor a Mohammedan.
Suddenly you are alone. the whole crowd has disappeared, you start
feeling afraid. And life comes only when you are alone. When you take
hold of your life in your own hands, when you are no more part of an
insane crowd. when you are no more part of this pathological world. But
then you have to be alone, and in aloneness there is fear.</p><p><br></p><p>When a challenge like love or sannyas or samadhi or God provokes you,
you feel as if death is coming close by. It is a sort of death. YoU will
have to die to the past, to the old; only then can you be reborn to the
new. Fear grips you. You say, ‘I w ill have to think.’ That’s what that
young man said: ‘I will have to think. I will have to wait.’</p><p><br></p><p>Thinking can never lead you into the new. Logic can never give you
any new conclusions, it goes on repeating the same. Logic is vicious,
circular, it moves in the same rut. Whatsoever conclusions come through
logic were already in the premise, they are not new. Maybe now they are
more articulate, that’s all, but they were given in the first
premise.</p><p><br></p><p>Only love – and love means illogical, paradoxical – takes you to new
conclusions. Because love knows how to take a leap. Logic is continuous
with the past, it knows no leap. Love knows leaps, quantam leaps. It can
jump from the old to the new, with no bridge in-between. Love can give
you a discontinuity with the past. But then there is fear. And love is
very life – if you miss love you will miss life, and then there will be
fear that ‘I am missing.’</p><p><br></p><p>You are missing because you have not been able to allow your heart.
You are continuously controlling through the head. The ‘heady’ people
always miss. Get deeper into your being, move towards the heart. And the
heart is not the ultimate, you have to move even deeper than the heart.
And then you come to your navel – what the Japanese call ‘hara’. These
are the three centers: hara – two inches below the navel; heart, and
head. The head is the farthestmost boundary-line – when you are farthest
from your being, you are in the head. When you are close to your being,
you are in the heart. When you are at the very core of being, you are in
the hara.</p><p><br></p><p>And only through the hara, fear disappears. Only through the hara do
you live for the first time authentically, sincerely, with no fear. And
that life needs to be lived. That life can be lived only if</p><p>you don’t divide existence into two – body/mind, matter/soul,
God/existence. If you divide, you will remain in the intellect. Drop all
divisions, live as one. All the three bodies have to be lived as one.
They are three aspects of your being – the physical body, the bliss body
and the Buddha body. And I am not against any – I am not saying choose
the Buddha body against the physical body. If you choose the Buddha body
against the physical body, your Buddhahood will miss something, will
lack something. It will not be perfect, it will not be the total
flowering.</p><p><br></p><p>When you don’t reject anything, when your acceptance is utter, then
you bloom. Then you bloom into a thousand-petalled lotus, SAHASRAR.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO, SINCE FALLING IN LOVE, EVEN THOUGH HAVING LITTLE TO DO
WITH HIM, IT SEEMS ENTIRELY MY OWN JOURNEY. FEELING NOURISHED AND MUCH
POWER IN MY BEING.</p><p><br></p><p>The question is from Anand Amrita.</p><p><br></p><p>Love IS nourishment. Love is exactly like food to the soul. Food is
nourishment for the body, love is nourishment for the soul. Without for
you will die physically, without love you will die spiritually – in fact
you will not even be horn. The body needs food, the soul needs love.</p><p><br></p><p>And Jesus is right when he says, ‘Man cannot live by bread alone.’
Because the bread is bread only for the body. You will have to seek and
search something which nourishes your soul. So, Amrita, be always in
love. And remember one thing: Lovers don’t matter, love matters. If one
lover disappears from your life, don’t become sour and bitter. If one
lover has moved away from you, don’t go on clinging to the past and the
memory and the nostalgia of it. That is sacrilegious, that is insulting
to love. The lover is good, but the lover is good because of love. You
need not sacrifice love for the lover. Lovers come and go, love
remains.</p><p><br></p><p>When one lover has gone out of your life, don’t become poisoned by
it, don’t start closing your heart. You have to live, you have to still
be in love. One should always be in love – with whom is immaterial. If
love goes on flowing, you will be nourished in your soul.</p><p><br></p><p>But there are people who make this condition too. They become too
much attached to the lover. It is as if a flute-player has become too
much attached to his flute and he cannot play on another flute. And this
flute has been stolen, is broken, now he will never sing. Now he will
never sing – because that flute is no more with him, how can he sing? It
will be a betrayal to that flute. This is foolish but this is how
humanity has been taught. If that flute is gone, search and seek for
another flute. Because your devotion should be towards the song, not
towards the flute. The flute is just a vehicle, a passage.</p><p><br></p><p>So are all lovers. If one love is no more there, start searching,
exploring, for another. Remain always in love, and your soul will grow,
will be nourished.</p><p>But people become obsessed. Obsession is pathological. Because of
obsession the world suffers too much. A few people suffer because they
cannot love, and a few people suffer because they have loved, but all
suffer all the same. Nothing is, and can be, eternal here; all is
momentary. Our meeting is momentary, all meetings are momentary. It is a
miracle that they happen – that you fall in love with a man or a woman
or with a friend. It is a miracle that it has happened – be grateful to
God, but don’t take it for granted. Nothing can be taken for granted. It
will disappear one day, as it has appeared.</p><p><br></p><p>It is like a rose flower. In the morning it was there, by the evening
it is gone. And the rose flower is far more beautiful because it will
disappear. If it was going to be there for ever and ever like a plastic
flower, there would not have been any beauty. The very possibility of
its disappearance makes it immensely valuable. So if you are in love
with a person, remember the rose flower. Love is a rose flower – it is
there, but it is not like a thing. It is very fragile. It is more like a
fragrance – it has come to you on the wings of the wind, the wind may
take it away again. It is a gift out of the blue. You cannot cling to
it, you cannot possess it. If you try to possess it, you will kill it
immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>So a few people start possessing and kill. And a few people don’t
possess, but when the lover has gone or has moved away, has taken his
path separate from your path. then you are full of tears for ever. Just
crying for the spilt milk. Don’t cry for the spilt milk. Go ahead,
search and seek again, God will come in some other form. Somewhere else
another bush may have bloomed. And who knows ’ A bigger rose flower may
be waiting for you.</p><p><br></p><p>Remain always in love, never betray love. Lovers come and go. Trust
love that it will happen again, that again you will be dancing and
singing. Trust life, trust love. And it IS nourishment, it is alchemy.
It is love that one is born through, it is through love that one becomes
again and again fresh, is rejuvenated. Again and again feels enthusiasm
for life, again and again feels celebration of life, again and again
feels grateful to God.</p><p><br></p><p>People whose loves have disappeared, whose hearts have become without
love, are like wasteland, are like deserts. They can pray but their
prayer will not have any beat to it. They can pray but their prayer will
lose all meaning. They can pray but their prayer will not have any juice
to it. It will be dry, it will be dust – it cannot relate to God.</p><p><br></p><p>The day you stop relating with people, you stop relating with
existence. People are the closest existence to you. Relate to people,
relate to trees, relate to birds and animals and rocks, and only then
will you be able to relate to God. Love is the way.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, I BELIEVE THAT NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT
IT?</p><p><br></p><p>Then try to strike a match on a cake of soap. The fourth
question:</p><p>Question 4</p><p>OSHO: THE FOURTH WAY, AS TAUGHT BY GURDJIEFF, HAS BEEN CALLED THE WAY
OF CONSCIENCE. WHAT PLACE HAS CONSCIENCE IN YOUR TEACHING?</p><p><br></p><p>The question is from Cecil Lewis.</p><p><br></p><p>No place at all. I don’t believe in conscience, I believe only in
consciousness. I don’t believe in morality, I believe only in religion.
I am amoral.</p><p><br></p><p>Conscience is a trick of the society played upon you. The society
creates conscience so that you may never need consciousness. You have
been deceived. For example, when Jesus says ‘Love is God’ it is not out
of his conscience, it is out of his consciousness. He knows it. It is
not a belief, it is his experience. When a Christian says ‘Love is God’
it is his conscience, not his consciousness. He has not known it, he has
not lived it. He has only heard it repeated again and again – he has
become hypnotized by it.</p><p><br></p><p>Each child is being hypnotized by the parents, the priests, the
politicians, the society. Constant repetition of a certain thing becomes
conscience. You go on teaching to the child, ‘This is right. This is
right. This is right.’ Hearing it again and again, his mind is being
conditioned. After many years he will also say ‘This is right’ – it will
be automatic. It will not be from his own being, it will come from the
gramophone record that the society has placed in his being. It is like
an electrode of Delgado. It is the dangerous trick that the society has
been playing on everybody, down the centuries.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why there are so many consciences in the world – the Hindu has
one type of conscience, the Mohammedan has another type of conscience.
How can consciences be so many? Truth is one. And consciences are so
many?</p><p><br></p><p>From my childhood I was taught a very very strict vegetarianism. I
was born in a Jaina family, absolutely dogmatic about vegetarianism. Not
even tomatoes were allowed in my house, because tomatoes look a little
like red meat. Poor innocent tomatoes, they were not allowed. Nobody has
ever heard of anybody eating in the night; the sunset was the last
limit. For eighteen years I had not eaten anything in the night, it was
a great sin.</p><p><br></p><p>Then for the first time I went on a picnic with a few friends to the
mountains. And they were all Hindus and I was the only Jaina. And they
were not worried to cook in the day. Mm? The mountains were so beautiful
and there was so much tO explore – so they didn’t bother about cooking
at all, they cooked in the night. Now it was a great problem for me to
eat or not to eat? And I was feeling really hungry. The whole day moving
in the mountains, it had been arduous. And I was really feeling hungry –
for the first time so hungry in my life.</p><p><br></p><p>And then they started cooking. And the aroma and the food smell. And
I was just sitting there, a Jaina. Now it was too difficult for me –
what to do? The idea of eating in the night was impossible – the whole
conditioning of eighteen years. And to sleep in that kind of hunger was
impossible. And then they all started persuading me. And they said,
‘There is nobody here to know that you have eaten, and we will not tell
your family at all. Don’t be worried.’ And I was ready to be seduced, so
they seduced me and I ate. But then I could not sleep – I had to vomit
two or three times in the night, the whole night became nightmarish. It
would have been better if I had not eaten.</p><p>Conditioning for eighteen years that to eat in the night is sin. Now
nobody else was vomiting, they were all fast asleep and snoring. They
have all committed sin and they are all sleeping perfectly well. And
they have been committing the sin for eighteen years, and I have
committed it for the first time and I am being punished. This seems
unjust!</p><p><br></p><p>Conscience is created; it is a conditioning. All that you think is
good or bad is nothing but a conditioning. But this conditioning can go
on managing your whole life. The society has entered in you and controls
you from there, from within. It has become your inner voice. And because
it has become your inner voice, you cannot hear your REAL inner voice.
So my suggestion is: Unburden yourself of conscience. Throw all the
conditioning OUt, cathart it, be free from it. That’s what I mean when I
say don’t be a Christian, a Hindu, a Jaina, a Buddhist.</p><p><br></p><p>Just be. And be alert. In that alertness you will always know what is
right and what is wrong. And the right and the wrong is not a fixed
thing – something may be right in the morning and may be wrong in the
evening, and something may be wrong in the evening and may be right in
the night. Circumstances change. An alert man, a conscious man, has no
fixed ideas. He has spontaneous responses but no fixed ideas. Because of
fixed ideas you never act spontaneously. Your action is always a kind of
reaction – not action really.</p><p><br></p><p>When you act out of spontaneity, with no idea, with no prejudice,
then there is real action. And action has passion in it, intensity in
it. And it is original and it is first-hand. And action makes your life
creative and action makes your life continuously a celebration. Because
each act becomes an expression of your being. Conscience is a false
being.</p><p><br></p><p>I think the French language is the only language which has only one
word for consciousness and conscience – a single word, meaning both.
That is beautiful. Real conscience should be only consciousness, nothing
else. You should become more conscious.</p><p><br></p><p>But about consciousness also, I have differences with George
Gurdjieff. When he says ‘Be conscious’ he says ‘Be conscious that you
ARE.’ He insists for self-remembering. Now, this has to be understood.
Your consciousness has two polarities. One polarity is the content. For
example, a cloud of anger is inside you – that is the content. And you
are aware of the cloud of anger – that is consciousness, the witness,
watchfulness, the observer. So your consciousness can be divided in two
– the observer and the observed.</p><p><br></p><p>Gurdjieff says: Go on remembering the observer – self-remembering.
Buddha says: Forget the observer, just watch the observed. And if you
have to choose between Buddha and Gurdjieff, I will suggest choose
Buddha. Because there is a danger with Gurdjieff you may become too
self- conscious – rather than becoming self-aware, you may become
self-conscious. You may become an egoist. And that I have felt in many
Gurdjieff disciples – they have become very very great egoists. Not that
Gurdjieff was an egoist – he was one of the rarest enlightened men of
this age. But the method has a danger in it: it is very difficult to
make a distinction between self-consciousness and self-remembering. It
is almost impossible to make the distinction, it is so subtle. And for
the ignorant masses it is almost always self-consciousness that will
take possession of them; it will not be self-remembering.</p><p><br></p><p>The very word ‘self’ is dangerous – you become more and more settled
in the idea of the self. And the idea of the self isolates you from
existence.</p><p>Buddha says: Forget the self, because there is no self. The self is
just in the grammar, in the language; it is not anything existential.
You just observe the content. By observing the content, the content
starts disappearing. Once the content disappears, watch your anger – and
watching it, you will see it is disappearing. Once the anger has
disappeared there is silence. There is no self, no observer, and nothing
to be observed. There is silence. This silence is brought by VIPASSANA,
Buddha’s method of awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinary man does both. He goes on changing his gear – sometimes he
observes the self, sometimes he observes the content. He goes on moving
from this tO that, he is a constant wavering. Gurdjieff says the one
thing is: Be settled in the observer. Buddha says: Look at the
observed.</p><p><br></p><p>My own approach is different from both. My approach is that
Gurdjieff’s method is more dangerous than Buddha’s method, but even in
Buddha’s method there is bound to be some tension – the effort to watch.
The very effort to watch will make you tense.</p><p><br></p><p>A Buddhist monk was brought to me from Ceylon. He was unable to sleep
– for three years he had not slept. And all kinds of medications had
been tried upon him but nothing was helping, no tranquillizer was of any
help. And nobody had bothered that he goes on doing VIPASSANA, the
Buddha’s method of insight – nobody had thought about it. When he came
to me, the first thing I asked him was, ‘Are you doing VIPASSANA? –
because he is a Buddhist monk, he must be doing it. He said, ’Yes – for
three years.’ I said, ‘Then that is the cause of your
sleeplessness.’</p><p><br></p><p>If you are continuously making effort to watch, then in the night you
will not be able to relax and fall into sleep – the watching will become
continuous. And if you are watching even in the night, how can you fall
asleep? You cannot relax, the tension has become fixed. It is a known
fact that Buddhist monks sleep only three, four hours at the most. It is
not a gain. They think, and others also think, that this is a gain –
they have attained something, they sleep only three, four hours. It is
not. They are losing something very valuable – relaxation. And they will
look tense, on their faces they will look tense. They will look very
quiet, but tense. They will look very silent – but their silence is not
the silence of relaxation, but of effort. You can see the effort in the
comer, defining them.</p><p><br></p><p>My own method is: You relax. Neither watch the watcher nor watch the
watched. Just relax, be passive. If something floats and you cannot help
seeing it, see it. But don’t make any effort to see it deliberately. If
you are relaxed like a mirror, if some cloud passes by, it will be
reflected. Be like a mirror – lucid, passive. Drop both – the
Gurdjieffian method of self-remembering, and the Buddhist method of
watching.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you have to choose between Gurdjieff and Buddha, choose
Buddha. If you have to choose between Buddha and me, choose me.</p><p><br></p><p>Relax. And just see things. And there is nothing much – if you miss
something, it is not of worth. You can miss, you are allowed to miss.
Take life easy, take it easy.</p><p><br></p><p>So people who have been in some kind of effort – and Gurdjieff’s work
is of great effort – will be puzzled here. That’s why Lewis is puzzled,
a little bit confused. And sooner or later, either he has to understand
me or he has to condemn me – both are open. And condemnation will be
easier. Because for thirty yeas working hard – and now sud-denly he has
become attracted to a man who</p><p>does not believe in effort at all. Who does not believe in
improvement, who does not believe in growth, who does not believe in
going anywhere, who does not believe in any WAY.</p><p><br></p><p>He says, THE FOURTH WAY, AS TAUGHT BY GURDJIEFF.</p><p><br></p><p>What I am teaching here is: No Way. There is really no way, because
truth is not a goal. All ways lead away from where we are. All roads,
all ways, all paths, distract you from truth. And there is nowhere to
go, either. And nobody to go. There is no way of being here and now but
to be here and now. When I say ‘Be here and now’ don’t ask how – the
‘how’ will take you away. When I say ‘Be here and now’ don’t ask ‘What
is the way to be here and now?’ There is no way of being here and now
but to BE here and now. There is no way to be still, and no need of any
way. To see, wholly to see, that there is no way, is at once to be
still. Seeing that, is stillness. All ways lead everywhere but here.</p><p><br></p><p>To live one’s life as it comes and goes, is awareness. Passive,
lucid, mirror-like, with no tension. So I don’t teach you attention,
because attention has the word ‘tension’ in it. And the phenomenon of
attention has the feeling of tension in it – hence the word ‘attention’.
Enjoy, relax. Just understanding this, that there is nowhere to go, is
liberation. Liberation is not like a goal somewhere else waiting for
you. Liberation is understanding that you are already liberated.</p><p><br></p><p>It is impious for us to assert so flatly what should be, in the face
of what is. What is, is the truth. YATHA BHUTAM – that which is is the
truth. To assert what should be, is impious, sacrilegious, it is a sin.
‘Should’ is a sin. That which is – relax with it, float with it. I don’t
teach even swimming, I simply say float with it. It is our
responsibility to know how to accept and live through that which is.</p><p><br></p><p>So I don’t teach any way – fourth or fifth or sixth. And I don’t
teach conscience, I teach a lucid relaxed consciousness. Out of that,
many flowerings happen. Out of that, many songs are born. But they are
born on their own. You cannot be the doer of them and you cannot feel
enhanced that ‘I have done’. You cannot feel your ego fulfilled through
them. The more those flowers will come, the more you will disappear. And
one day there is flowering, but you are not. That is the day, the
moment, of liberation.</p><p><br></p><p>The fifth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5</p><p><br></p><p>I WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE.</p><p><br></p><p>Then first take sannyas. And you may not need to commit suicide,
because sannyas is the greatest suicide possible.</p><p><br></p><p>And why should one want to commit suicide? Death is coming on its own
– why are you in such a hurry? Death will come, it always comes. Even if
you don’t want it to come, it comes. You need not go to meet it, it
comes uninvited.</p><p><br></p><p>But you must be missing your life badly. It is out of anger, out of
desperation, that you want to commit suicide. I will teach you the real
suicide: Become a sannyasin. And the ordinary suicide will-not help</p><p>much, you will be born immediately into some other womb somewhere.
Some foolish couple will be making love somewhere, remember...and you
will be trapped again. You cannot escape so easily – there are fools and
fools. Before you will be escaping from this body you will be caught in
another net. And again you will have to go to the school and the college
and the university – just think of that! Think of all those miserable
experiences – that will prevent you from committing suicide.</p><p>You know, Indians don’t commit suicide so easily, because they know
that they will be born again. In the West, much suicide and the suicidal
idea exists; many people commit suicide. And psychoanalysts say there
are very very rare people who don’t think of committing it. In fact one
person has investigated and gathered data, and he says every person,
every single person, thinks at least four times in his life to commit
suicide. But he must be thinking of the West. In the East, because of
the idea of reincarnation, nobody wants to commit suicide – what is the
point? You escape from this door and from another door you are in again.
You can’t go so easily.</p><p>I will teach you real suicide, you can go for ever. That’s what it
means to become a Buddha – to go for ever. When somebody used to commit
this suicide in samadhi, Buddha had a special name for him, he would
call him ANAGAMI – one who will not return. One who has gone to the
farthest shore and will not be coming back. I can make you anagami, a
non-returner. Then no womb can be a trap for you again.</p><p>Why do you want to commit suicide? Maybe life is not going the way
you want it to go? But who are you to impose your way on life, your will
on life? Maybe your desires are not fulfilled? But then drop desires!
Why drop yourself? Maybe your expectations are not fulfilled, and you
are feeling frustrated? In frustration one wants to destroy. And there
are only two possibilities – either murder somebody or murder yourself.
Murdering somebody else is more dangerous, so people start thinking of
murdering themselves. But it is murder.</p><p>Why not change your life rather than destroying it? And please don’t
commit it here, otherwise you will create problems for me.</p><p>I have heard:</p><p><br></p><p>A policeman saw a man standing on the parapet of Blackfriars Bridge
one evening, obviously about to jump. Rushing over to him, he tried to
talk him out of it. ‘If you jump, sir,’ he said, ‘it will be my duty to
jump in after you to try to rescue you. Then I’ll get wet, catch
pneumonia, and die too. So why don’t you just go home quietly and put
your head in the gas oven?’</p><p>Please don’t create any trouble here. And don’t talk about it,
because there are many people who would like the idea – you may convert
a few people.</p><p>I have heard:</p><p><br></p><p>A man was walking across Waterloo Bridge late one night when he
noticed another man on the parapet about to throw himself over. He
rushed up to the would-be suicide and shouted, ‘Wait a minute! Don’t
jump! Come and have a drink and talk things over.’</p><p>The two men went off to a nearby pub and spent the next hour chatting
over the state of the country, inflation, taxes, and the future of
Western civilization. Then they finished their drinks, walked back to
Waterloo Bridge, and both jumped.</p><p>So don’t spread this idea here. If you want to commit suicide just
come in the evening to darshan and I will help</p><p><br></p><p>The seventh question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 6</p><p><br></p><p>I LOVE ORDINARY LIFE. IT IS LIKE DAYTIME IN WHICH I FEEL MORE AND
MORE AWAKE. BUT I OFTEN HAVE THE SENSE THAT THERE IS A UNIVERSE OF
MYSTERIES THAT BELONGS IN DARKNESS AND IS UNAVAILABLE TO ME. ESOTERIC
TEACHINGS, SYMBOLS, ‘HIGHER KNOWLEDGE’, SEEM TO POINT TO THESE
MYSTERIES, BUT I CAN NEVER GET INTERESTED IN THE BOOKS. I WOULD RATHER
JOURNEY INTO THE NIGHT. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS PLEASE?</p><p><br></p><p>The question is from Anand Rajen.</p><p><br></p><p>Rajen, there is no other life than this ordinary life. Because people
are incapable of living this ordinary life, they invent esoteric things.
These are the people who are incapable of living – they distract their
minds and beings. All esoteric teachings and all hidden teachings and
all those so- called mysteries are just mumbo-jumbo.</p><p><br></p><p>The mystery is here. The mystery is in the trees and in the rocks and
in the birds. The mystery is in people – in you, in me. The mystery is
in relating, the mystery is in singing, the mystery is in dancing, the
mystery is in love, the mystery is in prayer. Avoid all that nonsense
literature which goes on in the name of esotericism. It is pathological.
These are the people who are incapable of tasting this life. They have
to find some excuses, alibis, to avoid this life. They cannot enjoy,
they cannot be passionately in it. They don’t have passion, they don’t
have intensity of life, they don’t know how to live. They have forgotten
all – how to be natural and spontaneous. Now they have to find some way
to pretend that this life is not worth living, the grapes are sour –
there are other grapes, hidden grapes, which only they know and their
inner circle knows.</p><p><br></p><p>Theosophy and anthroposophy and masonic lodges – and all kinds of
nonsense goes on. Avoid it, it is against life. This is the only life
there is, the only dance there is. The real enlightened people have
known this life’s extraordinariness.</p><p><br></p><p>A man asked a Zen master: ‘Since you have become enlightened what
changes happen in your life?’ The master said: ‘Before I became
enlightened I used to chop wood and carry water from the well.’ And the
man asked: ‘Now that you have become enlightened what do you do? What
changes have happened?’ He said: ‘I chop wood and I carry water from the
well.’ But the man was puzzled. ‘Then,’ he said, ‘what is the
difference? It is the same thing.’</p><p><br></p><p>And the master laughed. He said, ‘It is not the same thing. Before, I
used to chop wood and think a thousand and one thoughts. Now I simply
chop wood. It is so beautiful just to chop wood and do nothing. Before,
I used to have a thousand and one desires while drawing water from the
well. Now I simply draw water. And to tell you the truth, there is no
one inside me who is drawing the water. And when I am chopping the wood
it is wonderful, because there is nobody in me chopping the wood. I have
disappeared! The wood is being chopped and the water is being carried,
and it is tremendously beautiful.’</p><p>The ordinary life becomes extraordinary if you live it totally,
fully. Avoid esotericism. They are dangerous things, you can become
hooked into them. And then you will be just in mind-trips, imagination.
If you love imagination it is okay, if you love fantasizing it is okay.
You can create your own planes and your own astral travels and subtle
bodies and whatsoever you want.</p><p><br></p><p>A young woman dreamt that the prince charming had come on his horse.
A beautiful horse and the beautiful prince – and she has been waiting
for this prince charming for ever and ever, and he has come. When you
wait too much, beware – it happens. And the prince took the woman on the
horse and the horse started galloping towards some unknown destination.
And the woman was thrilled – who would not be thrilled? And she asked
the prince, ‘Where are you taking me?’ And the prince said, ‘This is
your dream. So you say to me where you want to be taken. This is your
dream.’</p><p><br></p><p>In these so-called esoteric trips, wherever you are going it is your
dream. Masters will appear – Kuthumi and KH – and automatic handwriting
will appear, and messages will be received from the beyond. And all
sheer nonsense. Eat your breakfast and have a good sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>The eighth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 7</p><p><br></p><p>WHY DO PERSONS LIKE BUDDHA OR CHRIST APPEAR ONLY AT CERTAIN
TIMES?</p><p><br></p><p>Because they are afraid of you. They think a lot before they gather
enough courage to come back to this earth to be crucified by you again,
to be stoned by you again.</p><p><br></p><p>And sometimes, even if they come, they live here anonymously. So that
you cannot stone and you cannot crucify them. And then, everything
happens in its own time. When the spring comes trees will bloom, and
when the right time has come the fruits will ripen. Every moment things
are happening, but never anything happens for which the moment has not
come. Everything has its own time, and it is good.</p><p><br></p><p>On the planet Volcanus, the gases from the many volcanoes which

‌CHAPTER 1
The Lion’s Roar
11 December 1977 am in Buddha Hall
ALL BEINGS ARE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING BUDDHA. IT IS LIKE WATER AND ICE:
APART FROM WATER, NO ICE,
OUTSIDE LIVING BEINGS, NO BUDDHAS.
NOT KNOWING IT IS NEAR, THEY SEEK IT AFAR. WHAT A PITY!
IT IS LIKE ONE IN THE WATER WHO CRIES OUT FOR THIRST; IT IS LIKE THE CHILD OF A RICH HOUSE</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
A Single Shout
20 December 1977 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
IS THERE ANY PROOF FOR GOD?
I AM. You are. Everybody is. God is nothing but the totality. The trees are, the rivers are, the mountains are. These are the proofs. The sun rises in the morning and the moon is in the night, and the stars. These are the proofs.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
The Last Alleluia
12 December 1977 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
IS ENLIGHTENED CONSCIOUSNESS LESS SPICY THAN ORDINARY CONSCIOUSNESS?
CONSCIOUSNESS IS ONE. You cannot divide it in two. Consciousness is indivisible. You cannot say ‘ordinary consciousness’ and ‘enlightened consciousness’ – consciousness means enlightenment.
The ordinary person is not conscious, he is unconscious. He believes he is conscious – his very belief prevents him from becoming conscious.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
Now is the Only Time for the Heart
13 December 1977 am in Buddha Hall
The first question.
Question 1
WHAT IS MATURITY?
MATURITY is to know that nothing can be done. Maturity is acceptance of existence as it is: YATHA BHUTAM. Maturity is not to desire things otherwise. Maturity is relaxing with the whole. Immaturity is conflict, struggle. The part fighting with the whole is immaturity.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
On the Wings of the Wind

The first question:

DEATH IS UNKNOWN. You cannot be really afraid of that with which you are not at all acquainted. Fear is a relationship – you have to know something to be afraid of it.</description>

This Cake is Delicious

THE PURE LAND PARADISE IS NOT FAR.
WHEN IN REVERENCE THIS TRUTH IS HEARD EVEN ONCE, HE WHO PRAISES IT AND GLADLY EMBRACES IT

HOW MUCH MORE HE WHO TURNS WITHIN AND CONFIRMS DIRECTLY HIS OWN NATURE, THAT HIS OWN NATURE IS NO-NATURE – SUCH HAS TRANSCENDED VAIN WORDS.</description>

The first question:
Question 1
WHAT IS TURNING INWARDS?
TURNING INWARDS is not a turning at all. Going inwards is not a going at all. Turning inwards simply means that you have been running after this desire and that, and you have been running and running and you have been coming again and again to frustration.</description>

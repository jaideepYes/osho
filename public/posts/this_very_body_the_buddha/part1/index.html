IT IS LIKE WATER AND ICE:\nAPART FROM WATER, NO ICE,\nOUTSIDE LIVING BEINGS, NO BUDDHAS.\nNOT KNOWING IT IS NEAR, THEY SEEK IT AFAR. WHAT A PITY!\nIT IS LIKE ONE IN THE WATER WHO CRIES OUT FOR THIRST; IT IS LIKE THE CHILD OF A RICH HOUSE\nWHO HAS STRAYED AWAY AMONG THE POOR.\nTHE CAUSE OF OUR CIRCLING THROUGH THE SIX WORLDS IS THAT WE ARE ON THE DARK PATHS OF IGNORANCE. DARK PATH UPON DARK PATH TREADING,\n2\nWHEN SHALL WE ESCAPE FROM BIRTH-AND-DEATH? THE ZEN MEDITATION OF THE MAHAYANA\nIS BEYOND ALL OUR PRAISE.\nGIVING AND MORALITY AND THE OTHER PERFECTIONS, TAKING OF THE NAME, REPENTANCE, DISCIPLINE,\nAND THE MANY OTHER RIGHT ACTIONS,\nALL COME BACK TO THE PRACTICE OF MEDITATION. BY THE MERIT OF A SINGLE SITTING\nHE DESTROYS INNUMERABLE ACCUMULATED SINS. HOW SHOULD THERE BE WRONG PATHS FOR HIM?\nMY BELOVED ONES: I love you. Love is my message – let it be your message too. Love is my color and my climate. To me, love is the only religion. All else is just rubbish, all else is nothing but mind-churning dreams. Love is the only substantial thing in life, all else is illusion. Let love grow in you and God will be growing on its own accord. If you miss love you will miss God and all.\nThere is no way to God without love. God can be forgotten – if love is remembered, God will happen as a consequence. It happens as a consequence. It is the fragrance of love and nothing else. In fact there is no God but only godliness. There is no person like God anywhere. Drop all childish attitudes, don’t go on searching for a father. Divineness is, God is not. When I say divineness is, I mean whatsoever is, is full of God. The green of the trees, and the red and the golden – all is divine. This crow crying, and a bird on the wing. and a child giggling, and a dog barking – all is divine. Nothing else exists.\nThe moment you ask ‘Where is God?’ you have raised a wrong question. Because God cannot be indicated anywhere. He is not in a particular direction, He is not a particular thing, He is not a particular being. God is universality. Ask where God is not, then you have asked the right question. But for that right question you will have to prepare the soil of your heart. That’s what I mean by love – preparing the soil of your heart. If you are full of love, the world is full of God – they go parallel, they are part of one symphony.\nGod is the echo from the universe. When you are in love, the echo is there. When you are not in love, how can there be an echo? It is only you who are reflected again and again in millions of ways, it is you who are thrown back to yourself again and again. If you are in love, God is. If you are not in love, then what to say about God? – even you are not.\nI was thinking what should I give to you today? Because this is my birthday, I was incarnated into this body on this day. This is the day I saw for the first time the green of the trees and the blue of the\nskies. This was the day I for the first time opened my eyes and saw God all around. Of course the word ‘God’ didn’t exist at that moment, but what I saw was God. I was thinking what should I give to you today? Then I remembered a saying of Buddha: SABBA DANAM DHAMMA DANANA JNATI – the gift of truth excels all other gifts. And my truth is love.\nThe word ‘truth’ looks to me a little too dry and desert-like. I am not in much tune with the word ‘truth’ – it looks too logical, it looks too ‘heady’. It gives you the feeling of philosophy, not of religion. It gives you the idea as if you have concluded – that you have come to a conclusion, that there has been a syllogism behind it, argumentation and logic and reasoning. No, ‘truth’ is not my word, ‘love’ is my word. Love is of the heart. Truth is partial, only your head is involved. In love you are involved as a totality – your body, your mind, your soul, all are involved.\nLove makes you a unity – and not a union, remember, but a unity. Because in a union those who join together remain separate. In a unity they dissolve, they become one, they melt into each other. And that moment I call the moment of truth, when love has given you unity. First, love gives you unity in your innermost core. Then you are no more a body, no more a mind, no more a soul. You are simply one – unnamed, undefined, unclassified. No more determinate, definable, no more comprehensible. A mystery, a joy, a surprise, a jubilation, a great celebration.\nFirst, love gives you an inner unity. And when the inner unity has happened the second happens on its own – you are not to do anything for it. Then you start falling in unity with the whole beyond you. Then the drop disappears in the ocean and the ocean disappears into the drop. That moment, that moment of orgasm between you and the whole, is where you become a Buddha. That moment is the moment Buddhahood is imparted to you. Or, better, revealed to you – you have always been that, unaware.\nMy word is love. So I say: My beloved ones, I love you. and I would like you to fill the whole world with love. Let that be our religion. Not Christianity, not Hinduism, not Islam, not Jainism, not Buddhism, but love. Love without any adjective to it. Not Christian love – because how can love be Christian? It is so stupid. How can love be Hindu? It is ridiculous. Love is simply love. In love you can be a Christ. in love you can be a Buddha – but there is no Buddhist love and there is no Christian love.\nIn love you disappear, your mind disappears. In love you come to an utter relaxation. That’s my teaching to you, I teach love. And there is nothing higher than love.\nThen I thought I should give you something beautiful on this day. And I remembered Hakuin’s Song of Meditation. It is a very small song, but a great gift. Hakuin is one of the greatest Zen masters. His song contains all: all the Bibles and all the Korans and all the Vedas. A small song of few lines, but it is like a seed – very small, but if you allow passage to it to your heart, it can become a great tree. It can become a Bodhi tree – it will have great foliage and much shade and thousands of people can sit and rest underneath it. It will have big branches and many birds can come and have their nests on it.\nSee: I have become a tree. You are the people who have come to make their nests on my tree. You can also become this. Everybody SHOULD become this – because unless you become this you will go on missing your fulfillment. Unless you become a great tree which has come to its foliage,\nflowers and fruits – which is fulfilled – you will remain in discontent. Anguish will go on gnawing in your heart, misery will linger around you. Bliss will be only a word, signifying nothing. God will be just gibberish.\nWhen you have fulfillment then there is grace and then there is God. In your fulfillment you come to realize the benediction of existence.\nThis is a song of meditation. Hakuin has called it ‘song’ – yes, it is a song. If meditation is without a song it is do and dead – it does not beat it does not breathe. It is a song and a dance: sing it and dance it. Just don’t think upon it – then you will miss the messages you will miss its content. You will find this song and its meaning only when you are singing and dancing. When the music of life has overtaken you, has possessed you.\nHakuin’s song is so small and yet so vast, it is unbelievable. How can a man condense so much truth and so much love and so much insight into so few words? But Hakuin was a man of few words, a man of silence. For years he would not speak at all, and then he would speak a word or two.\nOnce the Emperor of Japan invited him to deliver a sermon in the palace. And the queen and the king and the prime minister and the ministers and the high officials and the generals, they all had gathered with great respect to listen. Hakuin came, stood there for a single moment, looked around, and left the hall. The king was puzzled. He asked his prime minister, ‘What is the Matter with this man? We had come to listen.’ The old prime minister said, ‘This is the greatest sermon that I have ever heard. He has said it! You had asked him to come and teach you about silence. He has taught it! He stood there in silence, he WAS silence. What more do you ask? What more do you demand? He was pure silence, standing there for those few seconds. He was utter silence. He was silence, throbbing, pulsating. But you were looking to hear some words.’\nBut about silence nothing can be said. And all that is said about silence will be wrong. How can you say anything about silence? To say something will be falsifying it. That’s why Lao Tzu says Nothing can be said about Tao – and if something is said, in the very saying of it, it has become untrue. Tao is silent. But that silence is not the silence of a cemetery. It is the silence of a garden where trees are alive breathing and yet there is utter silence. It is not a dead silence, it is an alive silence. Hence he has called it ‘The Song of Meditation’.\nBuddha says: My approach to reality is not of belief but of seeing. His religion has been qualified as ‘IHI PASSIKA: Come and see.’ Not as ‘Come and believe.’ Buddha says ‘Come and see: IHI PASSIKA.’ It is here, present – you just come and see. He does not require you to believe. He is the only great teacher in the world who dropped belief – and with dropping belief he transformed religion from a very low childish stature to a very mature thing. With Buddha religion became young. Otherwise it was childish. It was a kind of belief – belief is superstition, belief is out of fear. And belief is blind. Buddha has given eyes to religion. He says: See, and there is no need to believe. And when you have seen then it will not be a belief, it will be knowing.\nIn this song of Hakuin you will see the way of seeing – how to open the eyes. Because truth is always there, has been always there. It is not that the truth has to be produced. Buddha says: YATHA BHUTAM – It is! It is already there, it is confronting you! It is in the east, it is in the west, it is in the north, it is in the south. It surrounds you – it is without and it is within. But you will have\nto see it: IHI PASSIKA. Your eyes are closed, you have forgotten how to open them. Meditation is nothing but the art of opening your eyes. The art of cleansing your eyes. the art of dropping the dust that has gathered on the mirror of your consciousness. It is natural, dust gathers. Man has been traveling and traveling for thousands of lives – dust gathers. We are all travelers, much dust has gathered – so much so that the mirror has completely disappeared. There is only dust upon dust, layers and layers of dust, and you cannot see the mirror. But the mirror is still there – it cannot be lost, because it is your very nature. If it can be lost then it will not be your nature. It is not that you have a mirror: you ARE the mirror. The traveler is the mirror – he cannot lose it, he can only forget it. At the most, forgetfulness.\nYou have not lost your Buddhahood. Buddha hood means the mirror clean of dust. The mirror again fresh, again reflecting, again functioning – that’s what Buddhahood is. Buddha hood means a consciousness which has become awakened. The sleep is no more and the dreams are no more and the desires have disappeared. The dust gathers, it is natural. But you cling to the dust – your desire functions like a glue.\nAnd what is your desire? That has to be understood. If you have understood your desire you have understood all. Because in the understanding of desire, desire ceases. And when desire ceases, suddenly you have a totally new feel of your being; you are no more the old. What is the desire? What are you searching? What are you seeking?\nHappiness. Bliss. Joy. That’s what you are seeking. And you have been seeking for millennia, and you have not found it yet. It is time, the RIGHT time, to think again, to meditate again. You have been seeking so hard, you have been trying so hard – perhaps you are missing just because you are trying? Maybe it is trying that keeps you away from happiness? Let us think over it, brood over it. Give a little pause to your search, recapitulate.\nYou have been searching for many lives. You don’t remember other lives, no need – but in this life you have been searching, that will do. And you have not found it. And nobody has ever found it by searching. Something is wrong in the very search. In the search naturally you forget yourself; you start looking everywhere, everywhere else. You look to the north and to the east and to the west and to the south, and in the sky and underneath the seas, and you go on searching everywhere. And the search becomes more and more desperate, because the more and more you search and you don’t find, great anxiety arises – ‘Am I going to make it this time, or am I again going to miss it?’\nMore and more desperation, more and more misery, more and more madness. You go nuts. And the happiness remains as far away as ever – in fact it recedes farther away from you. The more you search, the less is the possibility to get it. Because it is inside you.\nHappiness is the function of your consciousness when it is awake. Unhappiness is the function of your consciousness when it is asleep. Unconsciousness is your mirror burdened with great dust and luggage and past. Happiness is when the burden has been dropped and the mirror has been found again. And again your mirror can reflect the trees and the sun and the sand and the sea and the stars. When you have again become innocent, when you again have again become innocent, when you again have the eyes of a child – in that clarity you are happy.\nI was reading a few lines of Michael Adam. They are beautiful.\n’Perhaps trying even makes for unhappiness. Perhaps all the din of my desiring has kept the strange bird from my shoulder. I have tried so long and so loud after happiness. I have looked so far and wide. I have always imagined that happiness was an island in the river. Perhaps it is the river. I have thought happiness to be the name of an inn at the end of the road. Perhaps it is the road. I have believed that happiness was always tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. Perhaps it is here. Perhaps it is now. I have looked everywhere else.\n’So: here and now.\n’But here and now is clearly unhappiness. Perhaps then no such thing as happiness. Perhaps happiness exists not, it is just a dream created by an unhappy mind. Certainly it cannot be as I unhappily imagine it. Here and now there is not happiness. So happiness is not. I need not therefore waste myself on what is not. I can forget about happiness then; I can cease to care and instead concern myself with something that I do know, can feel and fully experience. Happiness is an idle dream: now it is morning. I can awaken and stay with unhappiness, with what is real under the sun this moment. And now I see how much of my unhappiness came from trying to be happy; even I can see that TRYING is UNHAPPINESS. Happiness does not try.…\n‘At last I am here and now. At last I am what I am. I am unpretending, at ease. I am unhappy – so what?... But is THIS what I ran from? Is this really unhappiness?...’\nThink over it, meditate over it.\n‘And when I cease to try to be happy or anything else, when I do not seek anymore, when I do not care to go anywhere, get anything, then it seems I am already arrived in a strange place: I am here and now. When I see that I can do nothing, that all my doing is the same dream, in the moment that I see this, my mind the old dreamer and wanderer is for the moment still and present.’\nNaturally. If you are not searching, not seeking, not desiring, not dreaming, for a moment the mind falls into a silence. It is still. There is nothing to hanker about, nothing to make a fuss about, nothing to expect and nothing to be frustrated about. For a moment the mind stops its constant chasing. In that moment of stillness you are in a strange place, you are in a strange space, unknown, never known before. A new door has opened. For the moment the mind is still and present.\n’For the moment, here and now, the real world shows, and see: here and now is already and always all that I had sought and striven after elsewhere and apart. More than that: I have hunted after shadows; the reality is here in this sunlit place, in this bird-call now. It was my seeking aster reality that took me from it; desire deafened me. The bird was singing here all the while.\n‘If I am still and careless to find happiness, then happiness it seems is able to find me. It is, if I am truly still, as still as death – if I am thoroughly dead, here and now.’\nHappiness suddenly jumps upon you. When desire disappears, happiness appears. When the striving is no more, for the first time you see who you are. That knowing is what Buddha means: Come and see – IHI PASSIKA. From where is he calling you: ‘Come and see’? He is calling you from your desires. You have gone far away from your home, you have lost your home base. You are not where you appear to be. Your dream has taken you to faraway worlds – imaginary; illusory, your own creation.\nZen people have a special word for meditation, they call it ‘FU-SHO’. FU-SHO means ‘unproduced’. You cannot produce it, you cannot do anything to bring it. You have to be passive, in a state of non- doing – then it comes. Then it comes suddenly, from nowhere, from the blue. And in that coming, in that shower of silence and stillness, is the transformation. It is nothing special, Zen people say. How can it be special? It is everybody’s nature, so how can it be special? It is utterly ordinary, everybody has it. You may know, you may not know – that is a different thing – but you have it. Not for a single moment have you missed it. Not for a single moment has it been taken away from you. It has been there, lying and lying and waiting for you to come back home.\nAnother word Zen people use for meditation is ‘WU-SHI’. It means ‘nothing special’ or ‘no fuss’. Now this song of Hakuin.\nALL BEINGS ARE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING BUDDHAS.\nThis one sentence is enough. It is the beginning and the middle and the end. It is all. The alpha and the omega.\nALL BEINGS ARE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING BUDDHAS.\nYou are Buddhas. Never for a single moment have you been otherwise. You CANNOT. You cannot really go away from your Buddhahood, you can only dream. You can only dream that you have gone away, but while dreaming you will still remain here now. This is impossible, to lose your Buddhahood, because God is involved in every thing and every being. And when Hakuin says, ‘All beings are from the very beginning Buddhas,’ don’t think that he is talking only of human beings. Animals are included, so are included the birds and the trees and the rocks. All that is, is included.\nThe English word ‘being’ comes from a Sanskrit root ‘BHU’. BHU means ‘that which grows’. All that grows is God. The trees grow, the birds grow, the rocks grow. All that grows is God. And everything grows in its own pace. Remember, the root of ‘being’, the word ‘being’, is BHU. It simply means that which breathes, that which grows, that which has life – howsoever rudimentary, howsoever primitive. All is included.\nALL BEINGS ARE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING BUDDHAS.\nAnd what is the meaning of a Buddha? ‘Buddha’ means a consciousness that has come back to itself – is no more wandering in dreams, is no more thinking of the future, is no more thinking of the past. A consciousness that is not possessed by memories or possessed by imagination. A consciousness that has got rid of the past and rid of the future, a consciousness that has only present. A consciousness that lives in the moment, utterly here now. Alert, awake, radiant.\nAll beings are Buddhas. Zen people call this single sentence ‘The Lion’s Roar’. It is. In a single stroke Hakuin has delivered you, has saved you from yourself. There is no more salvation needed. A single statement is enough to release you from all bondage. You are a Buddha. But remember you are not a Buddha in any special sense. Everybody is – your dog and your cow and your buffalo and your donkey, everybody is! So don’t take it in an egoistic sense, that ‘I am a Buddha’. Don’t make it ambitious, don’t go on an ambition trip. ALL is Buddha. Life is Buddha, being is Buddhahood, existence is Buddhahood.\nJust think of it. One of the greatest statements ever made:\nALL BEINGS ARE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING BUDDHAS.\nHakuin has finished in one sentence. The remaining song will be a repetition, really. The remaining song will be for those who cannot understand the first statement. It is said, when Hakuin was writing this song and he wrote his first sentence – ‘All beings are from the very beginning Buddhas’ – one of his disciples was sitting there and he said, ‘Stop now. Now there is no more to say.’ He left the room, the disciple left the room. He said, ‘Now there is no point. You have finished in the first sentence – this should be the LAST sentence!’\nBut still the song is beautiful. It will help you from different directions to come to the same truth. It will help you to see the point from different vantage points, from different windows. You will see the same Buddha sitting, from every window of the temple. But it is good, because from some window there may be more light falling on the Buddha, from some window the green of the trees may be reflected in the Buddha’s face, from some other window a star may be looking at the Buddha, from some other window something else – a bird may be sitting and singing a song.\nALL BEINGS ARE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING BUDDHAS.\nThe universe is made of the stuff called ‘God’ . So God is not in the end. God is in the beginning, in the middle, and the end. Only God is. But let me remind you, when I use the word ‘God’ I mean godliness.\nIT IS LIKE WATER AND ICE:\nAPART FROM WATER, NO ICE,\nOUTSIDE LIVING BEINGS, NO BUDDHAS.\nHakuin says: It is like water and ice. There is no difference between water and ice, and yet a sort of difference. If you have gone to the market to purchase ice, you will not purchase water. You will purchase ice – you will insist. If somebody says, ‘Take this water,’ you will say, ‘I have come for the ice.’ There is a sort of difference. But not much, not really – only on the surface. The ice will melt and will become water, and the water can become frozen and can be turned into ice. They are two phases of one phenomenon.\nYou are like ice and Buddha is like water. You are frozen, he has melted. And let me repeat: There is no other alchemy then love to help you melt. Love melts, because love is warmth. People melt only in love. When they are not in love they become cold, and in the cold they freeze. And you must have watched it, even in your small ways. When you are loving you are flowing. When you are flowing you are glowing. When you are loving you expand. When you are not loving you shrink. When you are loving you have warmth around you. When you are not loving you are surrounded by a cold wind – you are freezing, and anybody who comes close to you will freeze.\nThere are people, if they look at you with their cold eyes you will feel a shivering. And there are people, when they look at you with their warmth, with their love, you suddenly feel this is your home.\nThere are eyes which give you the feeling of being at home, and there are eyes which stare at you and make you aware that you are a stranger here.\nAPART FROM WATER, NO ICE,\nOUTSIDE LIVING BEINGS, NO BUDDHAS.\nSo Buddha hood is nothing but a state of merger. Frozen Ness is gone. Your definition has disappeared. You are no more limited, you are no more confined. At the deepest core, you are no more. Because if you ARE then there will be some kind of frozenness in you. If you ARE then you cannot be flowing – something will be hindering and something will be stuck and something will be obstructing. When you are not at all.That’s why when two lovers are in deep embrace\nthere are not two persons. There is only one energy, revolving. When two lovers are really in deep embrace there comes a moment, the woman forgets whether she is woman or man and the man forgets whether he is man or woman. If that moment has not come then you have not loved.\nIn deep love you disappear. Still something is there, a kind of presence – but nobody is present. There is no center as frozen ice, there is no self. That’s why Buddha has very much insisted that your self is the root cause which is hindering you from being a Buddha. The feeling that ‘I am’ makes you ice, icy and cold. If this feeling ‘I am’ disappears, there is no problem. Ice will melt.\nIT IS LIKE WATER AND ICE:\nAPART FROM WATER, NO ICE,\nOUTSIDE LIVING BEINGS, NO BUDDHAS.\nThe Buddhist doctrine talks about Buddha’s three bodies. They have to be understood. The first body is called the body of truth, the universal body, the divine body. You can call it God. The second body is called the bliss body – the bridge between the first and the third. You can call it the soul. And the third body is the physical body.\nYou know only your physical body. You have not known your second body, the bliss body. And unless you know the second body you will not be able to know the third, the deepest – your universal body, your cosmic body, your Buddha body.\nThis is the Buddhist trinity – the father, the son and the holy ghost. Or, this is the Buddhist TRIMURTI – the three faces of God. Buddha says everybody has these three bodies. The first, the physical, is very frozen. The second is in a state of liquidity. And the third is vaporous. First the ice has to melt into water and then the water has to evaporate. Have you watched? The ice has definition, boundaries; the water has no definition, no boundaries. You pour the water into any jug, into any pot, it takes the shape of the pot. It is non-resistant, it is non-aggressive, it does not fight. It is liquid, it adjusts.\nThe man of compassion and love is like water, he adjusts. He has no resistance, he does not enforce his form on anybody. He accommodates, he is accommodative, he is spacious.\nAnd then the third, when the water has evaporated and has disappeared and become invisible. Now you cannot even pour it into a pot. It has become part of the sky, it has moved into the eternal, into the infinite.\nThese are the three states of water, and these are the three states of consciousness too. You have become too gross because you have become too much identified with your first body. As if a man has be fooled himself in believing that the walls of his house are his house. The walls of the house are not the house, you have to go a little in. You have to find the innermost core of your being – and that innermost core is invisible. That innermost core is almost like emptiness.\nThe first body is essence, the second body is form, the third body is action. People who live only in the physical body live only in doings – what to do, what not to do. Their whole life is just swerving, swaying, between this and that. Their life consists of doing; they don’t know anything else.\nThe second body is of form. A man starts seeing glimpses of non-action. That’s what happens in meditation – when you are sitting silently doing nothing, great joy arises. From nowhere, for no cause. You don’t know from where it is coming but great joy arises, as if out of nothing. Miraculously, magically. This is the second, the form. The joy takes form.\nAnd then there is the third. If you go on following and go on moving inwards, one day you reach to the essence. That, Buddha calls the body of truth. There, no action and no no-action. All has disappeared, the whole duality has disappeared, you have come to the very essence of existence. That essence is liberating. That essence is nirvana. And you are not to go anywhere to find it, you are carrying it all along.\nALL BEINGS ARE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING BUDDHAS. IT IS LIKE WATER AND ICE:\nAPART FROM WATER, NO ICE,\nOUTSIDE LIVING BEINGS, NO BUDDHAS.\nNOT KNOWING IT IS NEAR, THEY SEEK IT AFAR. WHAT A PITY!\nAnd if you go on seeking afar for that which is near, you will go on missing. Nobody is at fault. Before you go into the four comers of the world to search for it, first go into yourself. If you don’t find it there, then you can go anywhere you like. But people don’t go within, they start by without. And the without is vast – you can go on and on, you can search all over the earth. And people are searching. People come to me and they say, ‘We have been searching for our whole lives. And we have been to here and there, and we have been to Japan and to Ceylon and to Burma and to Thailand, and we have trove!led all over the East. And we have not found it yet.’\nThe East is within you! It is not in Thailand, it is not in India. And you will not find it anywhere. At the most, if you accidentally come across an enlightened man, he will throw you to yourself. Not that he will give it to you. Nobody can give it to you. It is already there; there is no need to give it.\nAnd because in the modern world communication has become easy, traveling has become easy, people are becoming even more mad. They go jumping from one city to another, from one airport to another airport. They are driving themselves crazy. And to reach home you need not enter into any aeroplane, into any train, into any car. You only need to enter into yourself. And ticket less – no ticket is needed. And nobody is there to debar you; it is your territory.\nI have heard:\nA party of Americans happened to arrive at Mount Vesuvius during one of its more spectacular eruptions. ‘Say!’ exclaimed one of the Yanks in an awed tone, ‘doesn’t that beat all Hell!’\n‘Sapristi!’ said the Italian guide. ‘How you Americans-a travel!’ Now even Hell is in danger, afraid of the tourists.\nPeople go on searching and seeking for something which needs no search, which can be found only when search stops. And I am not saying that you strive to stop it – then again you have started it. If you strive to stop it, then you have missed the point. You have just to see the point of it, that striving will take you away from you, that striving will create more and more tension. Seeing the fact – IHI PASSIKA. Seeing this, striving disappears and there is suddenly a stillness. In that stillness the first glimpse will come of bliss. You will enter into your second body. And when you have entered into the second body then it will be more and more easy, very lucid, to slip into the central most core – the essential body, the body of truth.\nOnce you have tasted something of your inner bliss then you have the vision where to really search for, where to go now. Disappear into your innermost being and you will find it. Seek, and you will miss. Don’t seek, and find.\nNOT KNOWING IT IS NEAR, THEY SEEK IT AFAR. WHAT A PITY IT IS LIKE ONE IN THE WATER WHO CRIES OUT FOR THIRST; IT IS LIKE THE CHILD OF A RICH HOUSE\nWHO HAS STRAYED AWAY AMONG THE POOR.\nAnd has forgotten that he is rich – may have become a beggar. You ARE rich, infinitely rich. You are all emperors and empresses, gods and godesses. Just recognize. Don’t get too much into begging – and desire creates the beggar. Even a man like Alexander is a beggar, because the desire is there. A man like Napoleon is a beggar, because the desire is there. See the richest people of this earth and you will see just beggars and nothing else. And sometimes it happens, you come across a beggar and you see the emperor sitting there under the tree – having nothing, trot possessing anything.\nJust possess yourself and you have possessed all. Be the master of yourself and you have become the master of all. Possessing things, you will remain a beggar. And people go on changing but not really transforming. You possess one thing, then you start possessing another thing, then you\npossess a third thing. Sometimes you start possessing other-worldly things, but nothing changes. Just form changes. Somebody possesses money and somebody starts possessing virtue. Now it is the same, not much difference.\nI have heard:\nEarly one Sunday morning, Farmer Giles looked out to see a flock of large black crows devouring his field of prize spring-cabbage.\nIn red anger he rushed out and began charging up and down the field manically, shaking his fists, tearing his hair, foaming at the mouth and screaming abuse of every known kind at the gouging birds.\nThe Reverend Goodbody, passing on his bicycle, was surprised by the sight and shocked to hear loud and violent cries of ‘Piss off, you thieving bastards! Piss off, you greedy black bastards!’ He stopped immediately and beckoned to the angry farmer.\nEmbarrassed and red-faced, Giles shuffled up with a humble ‘Good morning, Reverend.’\n‘Now, this really won’t do, Giles,’ said the good vicar. ‘So early on the Sabbath, there might be ladies present. These fowl too are God’s creatures. If you wish them to vacate your property, do it with love and compassion. Say “Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo,” then the greedy black bastards will Piss off!’\nBut what difference does it make? You and your priests, you and your so-called religious people, are all in the same boat.\nI am not saying start striving to stop striving, otherwise you will simply change the name of your madness and you will remain the same. You will just change the label of your neurosis. There are people who are greedy for money and there are people who are greedy for God. It makes no difference at all, they are the same people. Greed is greed. It makes no difference about what greed is, for what greed is. Greed is greed.\nJust see the point that striving is meaningless, that going anywhere is meaningless. Not because I am saying it – you have to see it: IHI PASSIKA. You have to see it, you are not to believe it. Believing won’t help; believing is just a whitewash on the surface. SEEING brings transformation.\nIT IS LIKE ONE IN THE WATER WHO CRIES OUT FOR THIRST...\nHakuin says: You are crying for happiness, and you are like a fish in the water crying for water and crying, ‘I am thirsty.’ You have it! And you are begging everywhere.\nIT IS LIKE THE CHILD OF A RICH HOUSE\nWHO HAS STRAYED AWAY AMONG THE POOR.\nDARK PATH UPON DARK PATH TREADING,\nWHEN SHALL WE ESCAPE FROM BIRTH-AND-DEATH?\nWhat is the dark path of ignorance? Looking outward. The farther you look, the more darkness. Because the light burns inside you. Looking closer and closer, and there is more light. That’s why we call a Buddha ‘enlightened’ – he has come to know and realize his light. It is a perpetual light – without Al y fuel it is there, it cannot be exhausted. Suns will be exhausted and the moons will be exhausted and the stars will be exhausted. But the light that burns inside you as consciousness is inexhaustible. It is eternal.\nOnce upon a time there dwelt an old king in a palace. In the center of a golden table in the main hall, there shone a large and magnificent jewel. Each day of the king’s life, the stone sparkled more resplendently.\nOne day a thief stole the jewel and ran from the palace, hiding in the forest. As he stared with deep joy at the stone, to his amazement the image of the king appeared in it.\n‘I have come to thank you,’ said the king. ’You have released me from my attachment to Earth. I thought I was freed when I acquired this jewel, but then I learned that I would be released only when I passed it on, with a pure heart, to another.\n’Each day of my life I polished that stone, until finally this day arrived when the jewel became so beautiful that you stole it, and I have passed it on, and am released.\n‘The jewel you hold is Understanding. You cannot add to its beauty by hiding it and hinting that you have it, nor yet by wearing it with vanity. Its beauty comes of the consciousness that others have of it. Honour that which gives it beauty.’\nThat’s why Buddhas go on giving you whatsoever they have attained, go on shaking. Because the beauty of it is in sharing. That’s why Hakuin has sung this song. That’s why I am here, sharing my being with you, my joy with you, my celebration with you. It is something that has to be shared to keep it alive. It is something that has to be given. The more you give it, the more you have of it.\nNever be a miser in your love and in your understanding. Share it. And you will have more and more of it. Don’t hoard it, otherwise you will miss it. One day you will find it has disappeared and there is nothing but stink left. Instead of fragrance there will be stinking. Share your love with everybody and anybody. Don’t make conditions to your love. And the best way to share is to share your understanding, to share your meditation.\nHakuin is doing that in this song. He’s sharing his Buddhahood. What he has known, he is singing about it, he is praising it. He is making it clear to people who have not yet attained but CAN attain. Maybe somebody hears the song, somebody is struck by it, stabbed in the very heart by it. It is a lion’s roar: somebody may be awakened out of his sleep.\nDARK PATH UPON DARK PATH TREADING,\nWHEN SHALL WE ESCAPE FROM BIRTH-AND-DEATH?\nBirth means getting attached to the physical body. Death means the frustration of that attachment to the body. Getting free of birth and death means getting free of the physical body. But how can you be free from the physical body? Unless you know the second body you will not be free from the physical body. So it is not a question of being free from the physical body; the basic question is how to enter into the second body. Once you are in the second you are free from the first. And once you are in the third you are free from the second too.\nThat’s why you don’t see Buddha laughing. Not that he didn’t laugh, but he has not been shown as laughing. Because in the third body, the body of truth, even bliss is meaningless. First, the body, the physical body, is the body of misery. Attached to the physical body you remain miserable. The second body is the body of bliss. Once you reach to it, all misery disappears, you are blissful. But bliss is the opposite of misery – part of duality. The body of truth goes beyond both, it is transcendental. Misery has disappeared, so what is the point of keeping bliss? When there is no misery, there is no point in bliss. When poverty has disappeared what is the point of holding richness? Even that can be dispossessed.\nWhen all duality disappears – pleasure and pain, happiness, unhappiness, day and night, life and death – then for the first time you are in God.\nTHE ZEN MEDITATION OF THE MAHAYANA IS BEYOND ALL OUR PRAISES.\nGIVING AND MORALITY AND THE OTHER PERFECTIONS, TAKING OF THE NAME, REPENTANCE, DISCIPLINE,\nAND THE MANY OTHER RIGHT ACTIONS,\nALL COME BACK TO THE PRACTICE OF MEDITATION.\nHakuin says: All that has been done in the name of religion down the ages, can be reduced to one single thing, and that is meditation – DHYANA. And what is DHYANA? Becoming aware of your physical body – the first DHYANA, the first step of meditation. Becoming watchful of your physical body. Watch yourself walking, watch yourself eating, watch yourself running, talking, listening. Watch. And through watching you will see you are different from the physical body. Because the watcher cannot be the watched, the observer cannot be the observed, the seer cannot be the seen, the knower cannot be the known.\nWatch the physical body, and the second body will arise. It is there – but you will start feeling. You will start recognizing it, it will start penetrating you. This is the first step of meditation: watch the physical body. Then the second step, and the last, is: watch the bliss body. Watch your ecstasy. And then you will suddenly see, the watcher cannot be the watched. ‘Ecstasy is there, but I am far away from it. Bliss is there, but I am the knower of it.’\nThen you start getting into the third body, the body of truth. Then you become a pure witness – SAKSHIN. And that is liberation. Hakuin says it happens through meditation that you discover, or REDISCOVER, your Buddhahood.\nBY THE MERIT OF A SINGLE SITTING\nHE DESTROYS INNUMERABLE ACCUMULATED SINS. HOW SHOULD THERE BE WRONG PATHS FOR HIM?\nAnd just in a single sitting it can happen. Hakuin does not preach the gradual path, Hakuin preaches the sudden path. It can happen in a single moment. It can happen now. You need not postpone it for tomorrow. Who knows? Tomorrow may never come. It never comes, really. It can happen this very moment. If your awareness is lucid, if your awareness is there, clear, crystal-clear, it can happen this very moment. THIS very sitting, and you can become a Buddha. And nobody is hindering the path except yourself. Nobody is the enemy except yourself, and nobody is the friend either.\nBY THE MERIT OF A SINGLE SITTING\nHE DESTROYS INNUMERABLE ACCUMULATED SINS.\nHakuin says: Don’t be worried about sins and your past karma. In a single sitting of meditation, all that can be burnt. The fire of meditation is so potential, it can burn your whole past in a single moment. There is no need to be worried about past karma – ‘I have done some bad, so I have to suffer. I have done something, so I have to go to Hell.’ If you want to go, you will HAVE to go! But these are all rationalizations that you are trying to find. If you wish, it is your wish – it will be fulfilled. This existence is very obliging. It goes on obliging – if you want to go to Hell, it supports. It says, ‘Go! I am all with you.’\nBut if you decide that ‘Enough is enough, and I have suffered enough,’ a single moment of meditativeness is enough to burn all your millions of past lives and millions of future lives too. You are released.\nStart meditating. Fist on the body. Then on your inner feelings of bliss, joy. And go moving inwards. And one day the song of Hakuin will burst forth in you too. You will flower. And unless you flower you have not lived, or lived in vain. You are here to bloom. And unless you bear much fruit and much flowers you will go on missing the meaning of life .\nPeople come to me and they ask, ‘What is the meaning of life’ As if meaning is there somewhere sold in the market. As if meaning is a commodity. Meaning has to be CREATED. There is no meaning in life. Meaning is not a given thing, it has to be created. It has to become your inner work. Then there is meaning – and there IS GREAT meaning.\nLove and meditate and you will attain to meaning. And you will attain to life, and abundant life.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"8024","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/this_very_body_the_buddha/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/this_very_body_the_buddha/>This Very Body the Buddha</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">1 The Lion\'s Roar</h1><div class=post-meta>38 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8024 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/This_Very_Body_the_Buddha/part1.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

ICE:</p><p>APART FROM WATER, NO ICE,</p><p><br></p><p>OUTSIDE LIVING BEINGS, NO BUDDHAS.</p><p><br></p><p>NOT KNOWING IT IS NEAR, THEY SEEK IT AFAR. WHAT A PITY!</p><p>IT IS LIKE ONE IN THE WATER WHO CRIES OUT FOR THIRST; IT IS LIKE THE
CHILD OF A RICH HOUSE</p><p>WHO HAS STRAYED AWAY AMONG THE POOR.</p><p><br></p><p>THE CAUSE OF OUR CIRCLING THROUGH THE SIX WORLDS IS THAT WE ARE ON
THE DARK PATHS OF IGNORANCE. DARK PATH UPON DARK PATH TREADING,</p><p>2</p><p>WHEN SHALL WE ESCAPE FROM BIRTH-AND-DEATH? THE ZEN MEDITATION OF THE
MAHAYANA</p><p>IS BEYOND ALL OUR PRAISE.</p><p><br></p><p>GIVING AND MORALITY AND THE OTHER PERFECTIONS, TAKING OF THE NAME,
REPENTANCE, DISCIPLINE,</p><p>AND THE MANY OTHER RIGHT ACTIONS,</p><p><br></p><p>ALL COME BACK TO THE PRACTICE OF MEDITATION. BY THE MERIT OF A SINGLE
SITTING</p><p>HE DESTROYS INNUMERABLE ACCUMULATED SINS. HOW SHOULD THERE BE WRONG
PATHS FOR HIM?</p><p>MY BELOVED ONES: I love you. Love is my message – let it be your
message too. Love is my color and my climate. To me, love is the only
religion. All else is just rubbish, all else is nothing but
mind-churning dreams. Love is the only substantial thing in life, all
else is illusion. Let love grow in you and God will be growing on its
own accord. If you miss love you will miss God and all.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no way to God without love. God can be forgotten – if love
is remembered, God will happen as a consequence. It happens as a
consequence. It is the fragrance of love and nothing else. In fact there
is no God but only godliness. There is no person like God anywhere. Drop
all childish attitudes, don’t go on searching for a father. Divineness
is, God is not. When I say divineness is, I mean whatsoever is, is full
of God. The green of the trees, and the red and the golden – all is
divine. This crow crying, and a bird on the wing. and a child giggling,
and a dog barking – all is divine. Nothing else exists.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment you ask ‘Where is God?’ you have raised a wrong question.
Because God cannot be indicated anywhere. He is not in a particular
direction, He is not a particular thing, He is not a particular being.
God is universality. Ask where God is not, then you have asked the right
question. But for that right question you will have to prepare the soil
of your heart. That’s what I mean by love – preparing the soil of your
heart. If you are full of love, the world is full of God – they go
parallel, they are part of one symphony.</p><p><br></p><p>God is the echo from the universe. When you are in love, the echo is
there. When you are not in love, how can there be an echo? It is only
you who are reflected again and again in millions of ways, it is you who
are thrown back to yourself again and again. If you are in love, God is.
If you are not in love, then what to say about God? – even you are
not.</p><p><br></p><p>I was thinking what should I give to you today? Because this is my
birthday, I was incarnated into this body on this day. This is the day I
saw for the first time the green of the trees and the blue of the</p><p>skies. This was the day I for the first time opened my eyes and saw
God all around. Of course the word ‘God’ didn’t exist at that moment,
but what I saw was God. I was thinking what should I give to you today?
Then I remembered a saying of Buddha: SABBA DANAM DHAMMA DANANA JNATI –
the gift of truth excels all other gifts. And my truth is love.</p><p><br></p><p>The word ‘truth’ looks to me a little too dry and desert-like. I am
not in much tune with the word ‘truth’ – it looks too logical, it looks
too ‘heady’. It gives you the feeling of philosophy, not of religion. It
gives you the idea as if you have concluded – that you have come to a
conclusion, that there has been a syllogism behind it, argumentation and
logic and reasoning. No, ‘truth’ is not my word, ‘love’ is my word. Love
is of the heart. Truth is partial, only your head is involved. In love
you are involved as a totality – your body, your mind, your soul, all
are involved.</p><p><br></p><p>Love makes you a unity – and not a union, remember, but a unity.
Because in a union those who join together remain separate. In a unity
they dissolve, they become one, they melt into each other. And that
moment I call the moment of truth, when love has given you unity. First,
love gives you unity in your innermost core. Then you are no more a
body, no more a mind, no more a soul. You are simply one – unnamed,
undefined, unclassified. No more determinate, definable, no more
comprehensible. A mystery, a joy, a surprise, a jubilation, a great
celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>First, love gives you an inner unity. And when the inner unity has
happened the second happens on its own – you are not to do anything for
it. Then you start falling in unity with the whole beyond you. Then the
drop disappears in the ocean and the ocean disappears into the drop.
That moment, that moment of orgasm between you and the whole, is where
you become a Buddha. That moment is the moment Buddhahood is imparted to
you. Or, better, revealed to you – you have always been that,
unaware.</p><p><br></p><p>My word is love. So I say: My beloved ones, I love you. and I would
like you to fill the whole world with love. Let that be our religion.
Not Christianity, not Hinduism, not Islam, not Jainism, not Buddhism,
but love. Love without any adjective to it. Not Christian love – because
how can love be Christian? It is so stupid. How can love be Hindu? It is
ridiculous. Love is simply love. In love you can be a Christ. in love
you can be a Buddha – but there is no Buddhist love and there is no
Christian love.</p><p><br></p><p>In love you disappear, your mind disappears. In love you come to an
utter relaxation. That’s my teaching to you, I teach love. And there is
nothing higher than love.</p><p><br></p><p>Then I thought I should give you something beautiful on this day. And
I remembered Hakuin’s Song of Meditation. It is a very small song, but a
great gift. Hakuin is one of the greatest Zen masters. His song contains
all: all the Bibles and all the Korans and all the Vedas. A small song
of few lines, but it is like a seed – very small, but if you allow
passage to it to your heart, it can become a great tree. It can become a
Bodhi tree – it will have great foliage and much shade and thousands of
people can sit and rest underneath it. It will have big branches and
many birds can come and have their nests on it.</p><p><br></p><p>See: I have become a tree. You are the people who have come to make
their nests on my tree. You can also become this. Everybody SHOULD
become this – because unless you become this you will go on missing your
fulfillment. Unless you become a great tree which has come to its
foliage,</p><p>flowers and fruits – which is fulfilled – you will remain in
discontent. Anguish will go on gnawing in your heart, misery will linger
around you. Bliss will be only a word, signifying nothing. God will be
just gibberish.</p><p><br></p><p>When you have fulfillment then there is grace and then there is God.
In your fulfillment you come to realize the benediction of
existence.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a song of meditation. Hakuin has called it ‘song’ – yes, it
is a song. If meditation is without a song it is do and dead – it does
not beat it does not breathe. It is a song and a dance: sing it and
dance it. Just don’t think upon it – then you will miss the messages you
will miss its content. You will find this song and its meaning only when
you are singing and dancing. When the music of life has overtaken you,
has possessed you.</p><p><br></p><p>Hakuin’s song is so small and yet so vast, it is unbelievable. How
can a man condense so much truth and so much love and so much insight
into so few words? But Hakuin was a man of few words, a man of silence.
For years he would not speak at all, and then he would speak a word or
two.</p><p><br></p><p>Once the Emperor of Japan invited him to deliver a sermon in the
palace. And the queen and the king and the prime minister and the
ministers and the high officials and the generals, they all had gathered
with great respect to listen. Hakuin came, stood there for a single
moment, looked around, and left the hall. The king was puzzled. He asked
his prime minister, ‘What is the Matter with this man? We had come to
listen.’ The old prime minister said, ‘This is the greatest sermon that
I have ever heard. He has said it! You had asked him to come and teach
you about silence. He has taught it! He stood there in silence, he WAS
silence. What more do you ask? What more do you demand? He was pure
silence, standing there for those few seconds. He was utter silence. He
was silence, throbbing, pulsating. But you were looking to hear some
words.’</p><p><br></p><p>But about silence nothing can be said. And all that is said about
silence will be wrong. How can you say anything about silence? To say
something will be falsifying it. That’s why Lao Tzu says Nothing can be
said about Tao – and if something is said, in the very saying of it, it
has become untrue. Tao is silent. But that silence is not the silence of
a cemetery. It is the silence of a garden where trees are alive
breathing and yet there is utter silence. It is not a dead silence, it
is an alive silence. Hence he has called it ‘The Song of
Meditation’.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha says: My approach to reality is not of belief but of seeing.
His religion has been qualified as ‘IHI PASSIKA: Come and see.’ Not as
‘Come and believe.’ Buddha says ‘Come and see: IHI PASSIKA.’ It is here,
present – you just come and see. He does not require you to believe. He
is the only great teacher in the world who dropped belief – and with
dropping belief he transformed religion from a very low childish stature
to a very mature thing. With Buddha religion became young. Otherwise it
was childish. It was a kind of belief – belief is superstition, belief
is out of fear. And belief is blind. Buddha has given eyes to religion.
He says: See, and there is no need to believe. And when you have seen
then it will not be a belief, it will be knowing.</p><p><br></p><p>In this song of Hakuin you will see the way of seeing – how to open
the eyes. Because truth is always there, has been always there. It is
not that the truth has to be produced. Buddha says: YATHA BHUTAM – It
is! It is already there, it is confronting you! It is in the east, it is
in the west, it is in the north, it is in the south. It surrounds you –
it is without and it is within. But you will have</p><p>to see it: IHI PASSIKA. Your eyes are closed, you have forgotten how
to open them. Meditation is nothing but the art of opening your eyes.
The art of cleansing your eyes. the art of dropping the dust that has
gathered on the mirror of your consciousness. It is natural, dust
gathers. Man has been traveling and traveling for thousands of lives –
dust gathers. We are all travelers, much dust has gathered – so much so
that the mirror has completely disappeared. There is only dust upon
dust, layers and layers of dust, and you cannot see the mirror. But the
mirror is still there – it cannot be lost, because it is your very
nature. If it can be lost then it will not be your nature. It is not
that you have a mirror: you ARE the mirror. The traveler is the mirror –
he cannot lose it, he can only forget it. At the most,
forgetfulness.</p><p><br></p><p>You have not lost your Buddhahood. Buddha hood means the mirror clean
of dust. The mirror again fresh, again reflecting, again functioning –
that’s what Buddhahood is. Buddha hood means a consciousness which has
become awakened. The sleep is no more and the dreams are no more and the
desires have disappeared. The dust gathers, it is natural. But you cling
to the dust – your desire functions like a glue.</p><p><br></p><p>And what is your desire? That has to be understood. If you have
understood your desire you have understood all. Because in the
understanding of desire, desire ceases. And when desire ceases, suddenly
you have a totally new feel of your being; you are no more the old. What
is the desire? What are you searching? What are you seeking?</p><p><br></p><p>Happiness. Bliss. Joy. That’s what you are seeking. And you have been
seeking for millennia, and you have not found it yet. It is time, the
RIGHT time, to think again, to meditate again. You have been seeking so
hard, you have been trying so hard – perhaps you are missing just
because you are trying? Maybe it is trying that keeps you away from
happiness? Let us think over it, brood over it. Give a little pause to
your search, recapitulate.</p><p><br></p><p>You have been searching for many lives. You don’t remember other
lives, no need – but in this life you have been searching, that will do.
And you have not found it. And nobody has ever found it by searching.
Something is wrong in the very search. In the search naturally you
forget yourself; you start looking everywhere, everywhere else. You look
to the north and to the east and to the west and to the south, and in
the sky and underneath the seas, and you go on searching everywhere. And
the search becomes more and more desperate, because the more and more
you search and you don’t find, great anxiety arises – ‘Am I going to
make it this time, or am I again going to miss it?’</p><p><br></p><p>More and more desperation, more and more misery, more and more
madness. You go nuts. And the happiness remains as far away as ever – in
fact it recedes farther away from you. The more you search, the less is
the possibility to get it. Because it is inside you.</p><p><br></p><p>Happiness is the function of your consciousness when it is awake.
Unhappiness is the function of your consciousness when it is asleep.
Unconsciousness is your mirror burdened with great dust and luggage and
past. Happiness is when the burden has been dropped and the mirror has
been found again. And again your mirror can reflect the trees and the
sun and the sand and the sea and the stars. When you have again become
innocent, when you again have again become innocent, when you again have
the eyes of a child – in that clarity you are happy.</p><p><br></p><p>I was reading a few lines of Michael Adam. They are beautiful.</p><p>’Perhaps trying even makes for unhappiness. Perhaps all the din of my
desiring has kept the strange bird from my shoulder. I have tried so
long and so loud after happiness. I have looked so far and wide. I have
always imagined that happiness was an island in the river. Perhaps it is
the river. I have thought happiness to be the name of an inn at the end
of the road. Perhaps it is the road. I have believed that happiness was
always tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. Perhaps it is here. Perhaps
it is now. I have looked everywhere else.</p><p><br></p><p>’So: here and now.</p><p><br></p><p>’But here and now is clearly unhappiness. Perhaps then no such thing
as happiness. Perhaps happiness exists not, it is just a dream created
by an unhappy mind. Certainly it cannot be as I unhappily imagine it.
Here and now there is not happiness. So happiness is not. I need not
therefore waste myself on what is not. I can forget about happiness
then; I can cease to care and instead concern myself with something that
I do know, can feel and fully experience. Happiness is an idle dream:
now it is morning. I can awaken and stay with unhappiness, with what is
real under the sun this moment. And now I see how much of my unhappiness
came from trying to be happy; even I can see that TRYING is UNHAPPINESS.
Happiness does not try.…</p><p><br></p><p>‘At last I am here and now. At last I am what I am. I am
unpretending, at ease. I am unhappy – so what?... But is THIS what I ran
from? Is this really unhappiness?...’</p><p><br></p><p>Think over it, meditate over it.</p><p><br></p><p>‘And when I cease to try to be happy or anything else, when I do not
seek anymore, when I do not care to go anywhere, get anything, then it
seems I am already arrived in a strange place: I am here and now. When I
see that I can do nothing, that all my doing is the same dream, in the
moment that I see this, my mind the old dreamer and wanderer is for the
moment still and present.’</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally. If you are not searching, not seeking, not desiring, not
dreaming, for a moment the mind falls into a silence. It is still. There
is nothing to hanker about, nothing to make a fuss about, nothing to
expect and nothing to be frustrated about. For a moment the mind stops
its constant chasing. In that moment of stillness you are in a strange
place, you are in a strange space, unknown, never known before. A new
door has opened. For the moment the mind is still and present.</p><p><br></p><p>’For the moment, here and now, the real world shows, and see: here
and now is already and always all that I had sought and striven after
elsewhere and apart. More than that: I have hunted after shadows; the
reality is here in this sunlit place, in this bird-call now. It was my
seeking aster reality that took me from it; desire deafened me. The bird
was singing here all the while.</p><p><br></p><p>‘If I am still and careless to find happiness, then happiness it
seems is able to find me. It is, if I am truly still, as still as death
– if I am thoroughly dead, here and now.’</p><p><br></p><p>Happiness suddenly jumps upon you. When desire disappears, happiness
appears. When the striving is no more, for the first time you see who
you are. That knowing is what Buddha means: Come and see – IHI PASSIKA.
From where is he calling you: ‘Come and see’? He is calling you from
your desires. You have gone far away from your home, you have lost your
home base. You are not where you appear to be. Your dream has taken you
to faraway worlds – imaginary; illusory, your own creation.</p><p>Zen people have a special word for meditation, they call it ‘FU-SHO’.
FU-SHO means ‘unproduced’. You cannot produce it, you cannot do anything
to bring it. You have to be passive, in a state of non- doing – then it
comes. Then it comes suddenly, from nowhere, from the blue. And in that
coming, in that shower of silence and stillness, is the transformation.
It is nothing special, Zen people say. How can it be special? It is
everybody’s nature, so how can it be special? It is utterly ordinary,
everybody has it. You may know, you may not know – that is a different
thing – but you have it. Not for a single moment have you missed it. Not
for a single moment has it been taken away from you. It has been there,
lying and lying and waiting for you to come back home.</p><p><br></p><p>Another word Zen people use for meditation is ‘WU-SHI’. It means
‘nothing special’ or ‘no fuss’. Now this song of Hakuin.</p><p>ALL BEINGS ARE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING BUDDHAS.</p><p><br></p><p>This one sentence is enough. It is the beginning and the middle and
the end. It is all. The alpha and the omega.</p><p><br></p><p>ALL BEINGS ARE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING BUDDHAS.</p><p><br></p><p>You are Buddhas. Never for a single moment have you been otherwise.
You CANNOT. You cannot really go away from your Buddhahood, you can only
dream. You can only dream that you have gone away, but while dreaming
you will still remain here now. This is impossible, to lose your
Buddhahood, because God is involved in every thing and every being. And
when Hakuin says, ‘All beings are from the very beginning Buddhas,’
don’t think that he is talking only of human beings. Animals are
included, so are included the birds and the trees and the rocks. All
that is, is included.</p><p><br></p><p>The English word ‘being’ comes from a Sanskrit root ‘BHU’. BHU means
‘that which grows’. All that grows is God. The trees grow, the birds
grow, the rocks grow. All that grows is God. And everything grows in its
own pace. Remember, the root of ‘being’, the word ‘being’, is BHU. It
simply means that which breathes, that which grows, that which has life
– howsoever rudimentary, howsoever primitive. All is included.</p><p><br></p><p>ALL BEINGS ARE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING BUDDHAS.</p><p><br></p><p>And what is the meaning of a Buddha? ‘Buddha’ means a consciousness
that has come back to itself – is no more wandering in dreams, is no
more thinking of the future, is no more thinking of the past. A
consciousness that is not possessed by memories or possessed by
imagination. A consciousness that has got rid of the past and rid of the
future, a consciousness that has only present. A consciousness that
lives in the moment, utterly here now. Alert, awake, radiant.</p><p><br></p><p>All beings are Buddhas. Zen people call this single sentence ‘The
Lion’s Roar’. It is. In a single stroke Hakuin has delivered you, has
saved you from yourself. There is no more salvation needed. A single
statement is enough to release you from all bondage. You are a Buddha.
But remember you are not a Buddha in any special sense. Everybody is –
your dog and your cow and your buffalo and your donkey, everybody is! So
don’t take it in an egoistic sense, that ‘I am a Buddha’. Don’t make it
ambitious, don’t go on an ambition trip. ALL is Buddha. Life is Buddha,
being is Buddhahood, existence is Buddhahood.</p><p>Just think of it. One of the greatest statements ever made:</p><p><br></p><p>ALL BEINGS ARE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING BUDDHAS.</p><p><br></p><p>Hakuin has finished in one sentence. The remaining song will be a
repetition, really. The remaining song will be for those who cannot
understand the first statement. It is said, when Hakuin was writing this
song and he wrote his first sentence – ‘All beings are from the very
beginning Buddhas’ – one of his disciples was sitting there and he said,
‘Stop now. Now there is no more to say.’ He left the room, the disciple
left the room. He said, ‘Now there is no point. You have finished in the
first sentence – this should be the LAST sentence!’</p><p><br></p><p>But still the song is beautiful. It will help you from different
directions to come to the same truth. It will help you to see the point
from different vantage points, from different windows. You will see the
same Buddha sitting, from every window of the temple. But it is good,
because from some window there may be more light falling on the Buddha,
from some window the green of the trees may be reflected in the Buddha’s
face, from some other window a star may be looking at the Buddha, from
some other window something else – a bird may be sitting and singing a
song.</p><p><br></p><p>ALL BEINGS ARE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING BUDDHAS.</p><p><br></p><p>The universe is made of the stuff called ‘God’ . So God is not in the
end. God is in the beginning, in the middle, and the end. Only God is.
But let me remind you, when I use the word ‘God’ I mean godliness.</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS LIKE WATER AND ICE:</p><p><br></p><p>APART FROM WATER, NO ICE,</p><p><br></p><p>OUTSIDE LIVING BEINGS, NO BUDDHAS.</p><p><br></p><p>Hakuin says: It is like water and ice. There is no difference between
water and ice, and yet a sort of difference. If you have gone to the
market to purchase ice, you will not purchase water. You will purchase
ice – you will insist. If somebody says, ‘Take this water,’ you will
say, ‘I have come for the ice.’ There is a sort of difference. But not
much, not really – only on the surface. The ice will melt and will
become water, and the water can become frozen and can be turned into
ice. They are two phases of one phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>You are like ice and Buddha is like water. You are frozen, he has
melted. And let me repeat: There is no other alchemy then love to help
you melt. Love melts, because love is warmth. People melt only in love.
When they are not in love they become cold, and in the cold they freeze.
And you must have watched it, even in your small ways. When you are
loving you are flowing. When you are flowing you are glowing. When you
are loving you expand. When you are not loving you shrink. When you are
loving you have warmth around you. When you are not loving you are
surrounded by a cold wind – you are freezing, and anybody who comes
close to you will freeze.</p><p><br></p><p>There are people, if they look at you with their cold eyes you will
feel a shivering. And there are people, when they look at you with their
warmth, with their love, you suddenly feel this is your home.</p><p>There are eyes which give you the feeling of being at home, and there
are eyes which stare at you and make you aware that you are a stranger
here.</p><p><br></p><p>APART FROM WATER, NO ICE,</p><p><br></p><p>OUTSIDE LIVING BEINGS, NO BUDDHAS.</p><p><br></p><p>So Buddha hood is nothing but a state of merger. Frozen Ness is gone.
Your definition has disappeared. You are no more limited, you are no
more confined. At the deepest core, you are no more. Because if you ARE
then there will be some kind of frozenness in you. If you ARE then you
cannot be flowing – something will be hindering and something will be
stuck and something will be obstructing. When you are not at all.<span class=s4></span>That’s why when two lovers are in deep embrace</p><p>there are not two persons. There is only one energy, revolving. When
two lovers are really in deep embrace there comes a moment, the woman
forgets whether she is woman or man and the man forgets whether he is
man or woman. If that moment has not come then you have not loved.</p><p><br></p><p>In deep love you disappear. Still something is there, a kind of
presence – but nobody is present. There is no center as frozen ice,
there is no self. That’s why Buddha has very much insisted that your
self is the root cause which is hindering you from being a Buddha. The
feeling that ‘I am’ makes you ice, icy and cold. If this feeling ‘I am’
disappears, there is no problem. Ice will melt.</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS LIKE WATER AND ICE:</p><p><br></p><p>APART FROM WATER, NO ICE,</p><p><br></p><p>OUTSIDE LIVING BEINGS, NO BUDDHAS.</p><p><br></p><p>The Buddhist doctrine talks about Buddha’s three bodies. They have to
be understood. The first body is called the body of truth, the universal
body, the divine body. You can call it God. The second body is called
the bliss body – the bridge between the first and the third. You can
call it the soul. And the third body is the physical body.</p><p><br></p><p>You know only your physical body. You have not known your second
body, the bliss body. And unless you know the second body you will not
be able to know the third, the deepest – your universal body, your
cosmic body, your Buddha body.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the Buddhist trinity – the father, the son and the holy
ghost. Or, this is the Buddhist TRIMURTI – the three faces of God.
Buddha says everybody has these three bodies. The first, the physical,
is very frozen. The second is in a state of liquidity. And the third is
vaporous. First the ice has to melt into water and then the water has to
evaporate. Have you watched? The ice has definition, boundaries; the
water has no definition, no boundaries. You pour the water into any jug,
into any pot, it takes the shape of the pot. It is non-resistant, it is
non-aggressive, it does not fight. It is liquid, it adjusts.</p><p><br></p><p>The man of compassion and love is like water, he adjusts. He has no
resistance, he does not enforce his form on anybody. He accommodates, he
is accommodative, he is spacious.</p><p>And then the third, when the water has evaporated and has disappeared
and become invisible. Now you cannot even pour it into a pot. It has
become part of the sky, it has moved into the eternal, into the
infinite.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the three states of water, and these are the three states
of consciousness too. You have become too gross because you have become
too much identified with your first body. As if a man has be fooled
himself in believing that the walls of his house are his house. The
walls of the house are not the house, you have to go a little in. You
have to find the innermost core of your being – and that innermost core
is invisible. That innermost core is almost like emptiness.</p><p><br></p><p>The first body is essence, the second body is form, the third body is
action. People who live only in the physical body live only in doings –
what to do, what not to do. Their whole life is just swerving, swaying,
between this and that. Their life consists of doing; they don’t know
anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>The second body is of form. A man starts seeing glimpses of
non-action. That’s what happens in meditation – when you are sitting
silently doing nothing, great joy arises. From nowhere, for no cause.
You don’t know from where it is coming but great joy arises, as if out
of nothing. Miraculously, magically. This is the second, the form. The
joy takes form.</p><p><br></p><p>And then there is the third. If you go on following and go on moving
inwards, one day you reach to the essence. That, Buddha calls the body
of truth. There, no action and no no-action. All has disappeared, the
whole duality has disappeared, you have come to the very essence of
existence. That essence is liberating. That essence is nirvana. And you
are not to go anywhere to find it, you are carrying it all along.</p><p><br></p><p>ALL BEINGS ARE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING BUDDHAS. IT IS LIKE WATER AND
ICE:</p><p>APART FROM WATER, NO ICE,</p><p><br></p><p>OUTSIDE LIVING BEINGS, NO BUDDHAS.</p><p><br></p><p>NOT KNOWING IT IS NEAR, THEY SEEK IT AFAR. WHAT A PITY!</p><p><br></p><p>And if you go on seeking afar for that which is near, you will go on
missing. Nobody is at fault. Before you go into the four comers of the
world to search for it, first go into yourself. If you don’t find it
there, then you can go anywhere you like. But people don’t go within,
they start by without. And the without is vast – you can go on and on,
you can search all over the earth. And people are searching. People come
to me and they say, ‘We have been searching for our whole lives. And we
have been to here and there, and we have been to Japan and to Ceylon and
to Burma and to Thailand, and we have trove!led all over the East. And
we have not found it yet.’</p><p><br></p><p>The East is within you! It is not in Thailand, it is not in India.
And you will not find it anywhere. At the most, if you accidentally come
across an enlightened man, he will throw you to yourself. Not that he
will give it to you. Nobody can give it to you. It is already there;
there is no need to give it.</p><p>And because in the modern world communication has become easy,
traveling has become easy, people are becoming even more mad. They go
jumping from one city to another, from one airport to another airport.
They are driving themselves crazy. And to reach home you need not enter
into any aeroplane, into any train, into any car. You only need to enter
into yourself. And ticket less – no ticket is needed. And nobody is
there to debar you; it is your territory.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard:</p><p><br></p><p>A party of Americans happened to arrive at Mount Vesuvius during one
of its more spectacular eruptions. ‘Say!’ exclaimed one of the Yanks in
an awed tone, ‘doesn’t that beat all Hell!’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Sapristi!’ said the Italian guide. ‘How you Americans-a travel!’ Now
even Hell is in danger, afraid of the tourists.</p><p>People go on searching and seeking for something which needs no
search, which can be found only when search stops. And I am not saying
that you strive to stop it – then again you have started it. If you
strive to stop it, then you have missed the point. You have just to see
the point of it, that striving will take you away from you, that
striving will create more and more tension. Seeing the fact – IHI
PASSIKA. Seeing this, striving disappears and there is suddenly a
stillness. In that stillness the first glimpse will come of bliss. You
will enter into your second body. And when you have entered into the
second body then it will be more and more easy, very lucid, to slip into
the central most core – the essential body, the body of truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you have tasted something of your inner bliss then you have the
vision where to really search for, where to go now. Disappear into your
innermost being and you will find it. Seek, and you will miss. Don’t
seek, and find.</p><p><br></p><p>NOT KNOWING IT IS NEAR, THEY SEEK IT AFAR. WHAT A PITY IT IS LIKE ONE
IN THE WATER WHO CRIES OUT FOR THIRST; IT IS LIKE THE CHILD OF A RICH
HOUSE</p><p>WHO HAS STRAYED AWAY AMONG THE POOR.</p><p><br></p><p>And has forgotten that he is rich – may have become a beggar. You ARE
rich, infinitely rich. You are all emperors and empresses, gods and
godesses. Just recognize. Don’t get too much into begging – and desire
creates the beggar. Even a man like Alexander is a beggar, because the
desire is there. A man like Napoleon is a beggar, because the desire is
there. See the richest people of this earth and you will see just
beggars and nothing else. And sometimes it happens, you come across a
beggar and you see the emperor sitting there under the tree – having
nothing, trot possessing anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Just possess yourself and you have possessed all. Be the master of
yourself and you have become the master of all. Possessing things, you
will remain a beggar. And people go on changing but not really
transforming. You possess one thing, then you start possessing another
thing, then you</p><p>possess a third thing. Sometimes you start possessing other-worldly
things, but nothing changes. Just form changes. Somebody possesses money
and somebody starts possessing virtue. Now it is the same, not much
difference.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard:</p><p><br></p><p>Early one Sunday morning, Farmer Giles looked out to see a flock of
large black crows devouring his field of prize spring-cabbage.</p><p><br></p><p>In red anger he rushed out and began charging up and down the field
manically, shaking his fists, tearing his hair, foaming at the mouth and
screaming abuse of every known kind at the gouging birds.</p><p><br></p><p>The Reverend Goodbody, passing on his bicycle, was surprised by the
sight and shocked to hear loud and violent cries of ‘Piss off, you
thieving bastards! Piss off, you greedy black bastards!’ He stopped
immediately and beckoned to the angry farmer.</p><p><br></p><p>Embarrassed and red-faced, Giles shuffled up with a humble ‘Good
morning, Reverend.’</p><p><br></p><p>‘Now, this really won’t do, Giles,’ said the good vicar. ‘So early on
the Sabbath, there might be ladies present. These fowl too are God’s
creatures. If you wish them to vacate your property, do it with love and
compassion. Say “Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo,” then the greedy black bastards
will Piss off!’</p><p><br></p><p>But what difference does it make? You and your priests, you and your
so-called religious people, are all in the same boat.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not saying start striving to stop striving, otherwise you will
simply change the name of your madness and you will remain the same. You
will just change the label of your neurosis. There are people who are
greedy for money and there are people who are greedy for God. It makes
no difference at all, they are the same people. Greed is greed. It makes
no difference about what greed is, for what greed is. Greed is
greed.</p><p><br></p><p>Just see the point that striving is meaningless, that going anywhere
is meaningless. Not because I am saying it – you have to see it: IHI
PASSIKA. You have to see it, you are not to believe it. Believing won’t
help; believing is just a whitewash on the surface. SEEING brings
transformation.</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS LIKE ONE IN THE WATER WHO CRIES OUT FOR THIRST...</p><p><br></p><p>Hakuin says: You are crying for happiness, and you are like a fish in
the water crying for water and crying, ‘I am thirsty.’ You have it! And
you are begging everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>IT IS LIKE THE CHILD OF A RICH HOUSE</p><p><br></p><p>WHO HAS STRAYED AWAY AMONG THE POOR.</p><p>DARK PATH UPON DARK PATH TREADING,</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN SHALL WE ESCAPE FROM BIRTH-AND-DEATH?</p><p><br></p><p>What is the dark path of ignorance? Looking outward. The farther you
look, the more darkness. Because the light burns inside you. Looking
closer and closer, and there is more light. That’s why we call a Buddha
‘enlightened’ – he has come to know and realize his light. It is a
perpetual light – without Al y fuel it is there, it cannot be exhausted.
Suns will be exhausted and the moons will be exhausted and the stars
will be exhausted. But the light that burns inside you as consciousness
is inexhaustible. It is eternal.</p><p><br></p><p>Once upon a time there dwelt an old king in a palace. In the center
of a golden table in the main hall, there shone a large and magnificent
jewel. Each day of the king’s life, the stone sparkled more
resplendently.</p><p><br></p><p>One day a thief stole the jewel and ran from the palace, hiding in
the forest. As he stared with deep joy at the stone, to his amazement
the image of the king appeared in it.</p><p><br></p><p>‘I have come to thank you,’ said the king. ’You have released me from
my attachment to Earth. I thought I was freed when I acquired this
jewel, but then I learned that I would be released only when I passed it
on, with a pure heart, to another.</p><p><br></p><p>’Each day of my life I polished that stone, until finally this day
arrived when the jewel became so beautiful that you stole it, and I have
passed it on, and am released.</p><p><br></p><p>‘The jewel you hold is Understanding. You cannot add to its beauty by
hiding it and hinting that you have it, nor yet by wearing it with
vanity. Its beauty comes of the consciousness that others have of it.
Honour that which gives it beauty.’</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why Buddhas go on giving you whatsoever they have attained, go
on shaking. Because the beauty of it is in sharing. That’s why Hakuin
has sung this song. That’s why I am here, sharing my being with you, my
joy with you, my celebration with you. It is something that has to be
shared to keep it alive. It is something that has to be given. The more
you give it, the more you have of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Never be a miser in your love and in your understanding. Share it.
And you will have more and more of it. Don’t hoard it, otherwise you
will miss it. One day you will find it has disappeared and there is
nothing but stink left. Instead of fragrance there will be stinking.
Share your love with everybody and anybody. Don’t make conditions to
your love. And the best way to share is to share your understanding, to
share your meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Hakuin is doing that in this song. He’s sharing his Buddhahood. What
he has known, he is singing about it, he is praising it. He is making it
clear to people who have not yet attained but CAN attain. Maybe somebody
hears the song, somebody is struck by it, stabbed in the very heart by
it. It is a lion’s roar: somebody may be awakened out of his sleep.</p><p>DARK PATH UPON DARK PATH TREADING,</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN SHALL WE ESCAPE FROM BIRTH-AND-DEATH?</p><p><br></p><p>Birth means getting attached to the physical body. Death means the
frustration of that attachment to the body. Getting free of birth and
death means getting free of the physical body. But how can you be free
from the physical body? Unless you know the second body you will not be
free from the physical body. So it is not a question of being free from
the physical body; the basic question is how to enter into the second
body. Once you are in the second you are free from the first. And once
you are in the third you are free from the second too.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why you don’t see Buddha laughing. Not that he didn’t laugh,
but he has not been shown as laughing. Because in the third body, the
body of truth, even bliss is meaningless. First, the body, the physical
body, is the body of misery. Attached to the physical body you remain
miserable. The second body is the body of bliss. Once you reach to it,
all misery disappears, you are blissful. But bliss is the opposite of
misery – part of duality. The body of truth goes beyond both, it is
transcendental. Misery has disappeared, so what is the point of keeping
bliss? When there is no misery, there is no point in bliss. When poverty
has disappeared what is the point of holding richness? Even that can be
dispossessed.</p><p><br></p><p>When all duality disappears – pleasure and pain, happiness,
unhappiness, day and night, life and death – then for the first time you
are in God.</p><p><br></p><p>THE ZEN MEDITATION OF THE MAHAYANA IS BEYOND ALL OUR PRAISES.</p><p>GIVING AND MORALITY AND THE OTHER PERFECTIONS, TAKING OF THE NAME,
REPENTANCE, DISCIPLINE,</p><p>AND THE MANY OTHER RIGHT ACTIONS,</p><p><br></p><p>ALL COME BACK TO THE PRACTICE OF MEDITATION.</p><p><br></p><p>Hakuin says: All that has been done in the name of religion down the
ages, can be reduced to one single thing, and that is meditation –
DHYANA. And what is DHYANA? Becoming aware of your physical body – the
first DHYANA, the first step of meditation. Becoming watchful of your
physical body. Watch yourself walking, watch yourself eating, watch
yourself running, talking, listening. Watch. And through watching you
will see you are different from the physical body. Because the watcher
cannot be the watched, the observer cannot be the observed, the seer
cannot be the seen, the knower cannot be the known.</p><p><br></p><p>Watch the physical body, and the second body will arise. It is there
– but you will start feeling. You will start recognizing it, it will
start penetrating you. This is the first step of meditation: watch the
physical body. Then the second step, and the last, is: watch the bliss
body. Watch your ecstasy. And then you will suddenly see, the watcher
cannot be the watched. ‘Ecstasy is there, but I am far away from it.
Bliss is there, but I am the knower of it.’</p><p>Then you start getting into the third body, the body of truth. Then
you become a pure witness – SAKSHIN. And that is liberation. Hakuin says
it happens through meditation that you discover, or REDISCOVER, your
Buddhahood.</p><p><br></p><p>BY THE MERIT OF A SINGLE SITTING</p><p><br></p><p>HE DESTROYS INNUMERABLE ACCUMULATED SINS. HOW SHOULD THERE BE WRONG
PATHS FOR HIM?</p><p>And just in a single sitting it can happen. Hakuin does not preach
the gradual path, Hakuin preaches the sudden path. It can happen in a
single moment. It can happen now. You need not postpone it for tomorrow.
Who knows? Tomorrow may never come. It never comes, really. It can
happen this very moment. If your awareness is lucid, if your awareness
is there, clear, crystal-clear, it can happen this very moment. THIS
very sitting, and you can become a Buddha. And nobody is hindering the
path except yourself. Nobody is the enemy except yourself, and nobody is
the friend either.</p><p><br></p><p>BY THE MERIT OF A SINGLE SITTING</p><p><br></p><p>HE DESTROYS INNUMERABLE ACCUMULATED SINS.</p><p><br></p><p>Hakuin says: Don’t be worried about sins and your past karma. In a
single sitting of meditation, all that can be burnt. The fire of
meditation is so potential, it can burn your whole past in a single
moment. There is no need to be worried about past karma – ‘I have done
some bad, so I have to suffer. I have done something, so I have to go to
Hell.’ If you want to go, you will HAVE to go! But these are all
rationalizations that you are trying to find. If you wish, it is your
wish – it will be fulfilled. This existence is very obliging. It goes on
obliging – if you want to go to Hell, it supports. It says, ‘Go! I am
all with you.’</p><p><br></p><p>But if you decide that ‘Enough is enough, and I have suffered
enough,’ a single moment of meditativeness is enough to burn all your
millions of past lives and millions of future lives too. You are
released.</p><p><br></p><p>Start meditating. Fist on the body. Then on your inner feelings of
bliss, joy. And go moving inwards. And one day the song of Hakuin will
burst forth in you too. You will flower. And unless you flower you have
not lived, or lived in vain. You are here to bloom. And unless you bear
much fruit and much flowers you will go on missing the meaning of life
.</p><p><br></p><p>People come to me and they ask, ‘What is the meaning of life’ As if
meaning is there somewhere sold in the market. As if meaning is a
commodity. Meaning has to be CREATED. There is no meaning in life.
Meaning is not a given thing, it has to be created. It has to become
your inner work. Then there is meaning – and there IS GREAT meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>Love and meditate and you will attain to meaning. And you will attain
to life, and abundant life.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

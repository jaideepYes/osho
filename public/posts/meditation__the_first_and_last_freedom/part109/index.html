It is very difficult for me to accept that it is just the polar opposite of the bright ones, I feel dirty and guilty and unworthy. I want to face all facets of my mind and accept them because I hear you often say that acceptance is the condition to transcend the mind. Can you please talk about acceptance?\nThe basic thing to be understood is that you are not the mind—neither the bright one nor the dark one. If you get identified with the beautiful part, then it is impossible to disidentify yourself from the ugly part; they are two sides of the same coin. You can have it whole, or you can throw it whole, but you cannot divide it.\nAnd the whole anxiety of man is, he wants to choose that which looks beautiful, bright. He wants to choose all the silver linings, leaving the dark cloud behind. But he does not know silver linings cannot exist without the dark cloud. The dark cloud is the background, absolutely necessary for the silver linings to show.\nChoosing is anxiety. Choosing is creating trouble for yourself. Being choiceless means: the mind is there and it has a dark side and it has a bright side\n—so what? What has it to do with you? Why should you be worried about it?\nThe moment you are not choosing, all worry disappears. A great acceptance\narises, that this is how the mind has to be, this is the nature of the mind. And it is not your problem, because you are not the mind. If you were the mind, there would have been no problem at all. Then who would choose and who would think of transcending? And who would try to accept and understand acceptance?\nYou are separate, totally separate. You are a witness and nothing else, an observer who gets identified with anything that he finds pleasant—and forgets that the unpleasant is coming just behind it as a shadow. You are not troubled by the pleasant side—you rejoice in it. The trouble comes when the polar opposite asserts; then you are torn apart. But you started the whole trouble. Falling from being just a witness, you became identified.\nThe biblical story of the fall is just a fiction. But this is the real fall: the fall from being a witness into getting identified with something and losing your witnessing.\nJust try once in a while: let the mind be whatever it is. Remember, you are not it. And you are going to have a great surprise. As you are less identified, the mind starts becoming less powerful because its power comes from your identification; it sucks your blood. But when you start standing aloof and away, the mind starts shrinking. The day you are completely unidentified with the mind, even for a single moment, there is the revelation: mind simply dies, it is no longer there. Where it was so full, where it was so continuously—day in, day out; waking, sleeping, it was there—suddenly it is not there. You look all around and it is emptiness, it is nothingness. And with the mind disappears the self.\nThen there is only a certain quality of awareness with no ‘I’ in it. At the most you can call it something similar to ‘am-ness’, but not ‘I-ness.’ To be even more exact, it is ‘is-ness’, because even in ‘am-ness’ some shadow of the ‘I’ is still there. The moment you know its is-ness, it has become universal. With the disappearance of the mind disappears the self. And so many things disappear which were so important to you, so troublesome to you. You were trying to solve them and they were becoming more and more complicated; everything was a problem, an anxiety, and there seemed to be no way out.\nI will remind you of the story, “The Goose is Out.” It is concerned with the mind and your is-ness.\nThe master says to the disciple to meditate on a koan. A small goose is put into a bottle, fed and nourished. The goose goes on becoming bigger and bigger and bigger, and fills the whole bottle. Now it is too big; it cannot come out of the bottle’s mouth, the mouth is too small. And the koan is that you have to bring the goose out without destroying the bottle, without killing the goose.\nNow, it is mind-boggling. What can you do? The goose is too big; you cannot take it out unless you break the bottle, but that is not allowed. Or, you can bring it out by killing it; then you don’t care whether it comes out alive or dead. That is not allowed either.\nDay in, day out, the disciple meditates, finds no way, thinks this way and that way—but in fact there is no way. Tired, utterly exhausted, a sudden revelation—suddenly he understands that the master cannot be interested in the bottle and the goose; they must represent something else. The bottle is the mind, you are the goose…but with witnessing it is possible. Without being in the mind, you can become identified with it so much that you start feeling you are in it!\nHe runs to the master, to say that the goose is out. And the master says, “You have understood it. Now keep it out. It has never been in.”\nIf you go on struggling with the goose and the bottle there is no way for you to solve it. It is the realization that “It must represent something else; otherwise the master cannot give it to me. And what can it be?” …Because the whole function between the master and the disciple, the whole business is about the mind and awareness.\nAwareness is the goose, which is not in the bottle of the mind. But you are believing that it is in it, and asking everyone how to get it out. And there are idiots who will help you with techniques to get out of it. I call them idiots because they have not understood the thing at all.\nThe goose is out, has never been in; so the question of bringing it out does not arise.\nMind is just a procession of thoughts passing in front of you on the screen of the brain. You are an observer. But you start getting identified with beautiful things—those are bribes. And once you get caught in the beautiful things you are also caught in the ugly things, because mind cannot exist without duality.\nAwareness cannot exist with duality, and mind cannot exist without duality.\nAwareness is non-dual, and mind is dual. So just watch.\nI don’t teach you any solutions. I teach you the solution. Just get back a little and watch. Create a distance between you and your mind. Whether it is good, beautiful, delicious, something that you would like to enjoy closely, or it is ugly\n—you remain as far away as possible. Look at it just the way you look at a film. But people get identified even with films.\nI have seen, when I was young—I have not seen any movie for a long time\n—but I have seen people weeping, tears falling. It is good that it is dark in a movie house; it saves them from feeling embarrassed—and nothing is\nhappening! I used to ask my father, “Did you see? The fellow by your side was crying!”\nHe said, “The whole hall was crying. The scene was such….”\n“But”, I said, “there is only a screen and nothing else. Nobody is killed, there is no tragedy happening—just a projection of a film. Just pictures moving on the screen; and people laugh, and people weep, and for three hours they are almost lost. They become part of the movie, they become identified with some character.”\nMy father said to me, “If you are raising questions about people’s reactions, then you cannot enjoy the film.”\nI said, “I can enjoy the film, but I don’t want to cry, I don’t see any enjoyment in it. I can see it as a film, but I don’t want to become a part of it. These people are all becoming part of it.”\nYou get identified with anything. People get identified with other persons and then they create misery for themselves. They get identified with things, then they get miserable if that thing is missing.\nIdentification is the root cause of your misery. And every identification is identification with the mind.\nJust step aside, let the mind pass.\nAnd soon you will be able to see that there is no problem at all—the goose is out. You don’t have to break the bottle, you don’t have to kill the goose either.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1491","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/meditation__the_first_and_last_freedom/part109/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/meditation__the_first_and_last_freedom/>Meditation: The First and Last Freedom</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">The goose has never been in</h1><div class=post-meta>7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1491 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Meditation__The_First_and_Last_Freedom/part109.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part108>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

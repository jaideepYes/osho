BUT NEVER HAVE YOU TOLD IT TO US QUITE SO STRAIGHT, WITHOUT CATERING TO OUR UNENLIGHTENED MORTAL STUPIDITIES. IS THIS THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY VIBE?\nYou got it! This is the twenty-first century for me, and I am trying to push you towards it.\nSannyasins should live ahead of time. The people who are burdened with the past live five thousand years ago, ten thousand years ago, and they are stuck there.\nYou cannot live with the past. The past is dead, and to live with the past is to be dead. The only life possible is in the present, and the future is always changing into the present. It is always making the twenty-first century in the twentieth century. The farther ahead you can live in the moment, the more alive you will feel. And remember, it is better to be red than dead!\nI had to wait for you to behave humanly. I was waiting for my people, because only they will understand that to be human is the highest value there is.\nI was talking to the Christians, to the Hindus, to the Mohammedans, to the Jainas, to the Buddhists, and it was a difficult job. I could not behave humanly with them. They wanted me to be their messiah, their prophet, their messenger.\nJust the other day I received two letters. One was from a woman in California. She said, “I have loved you for many years. I have been reading all your books – how beautiful it was when you spoke on Jesus! And now after three years of silence, what you are saying has enraged me so much that I have burned all your books. I will pray to Jesus Christ and God to forgive you. Perhaps you should go into silence again. And if you don’t go into silence, then there is only one possibility for you to be saved: that is, when you expire the silence will descend on your grave.”\nNow this woman had all my literature, had loved me, she thinks. But do you think she loved me? She loved Jesus Christ, and because I had spoken on Jesus Christ, putting myself behind him. putting my gun on his shoulder, she was happy, immensely happy and grateful. The poor woman is not aware of the fact that she had never been in tune with me. Because I was speaking on Jesus as no one had spoken before, I was supporting her mind, her tradition, and she was feeling immensely happy. I was fulfilling her ego.\nNow she is so against me, she has burned all the books, and she is praying to Jesus Christ, the God, to forgive me. She should also burn the house in which my books have been. They have already infected the air and the house.\nWhenever you feel that you are supported in some way, you are happy. Hindus were happy, Mohammedans were happy, Christians were happy – everybody was happy. And I am not here to make you happy.\nI want you to be blissful. I want you to know yourself, to know this vast existence. And you cannot know it being a Christian or a Hindu. Your eyes are covered with layers of dust that centuries have poured over you.\nNow she is feeling very offended, but still she cannot see the point. I had to speak on Jesus, Buddha, Mahavira, and hundreds of other prophets, messiahs, saviors. But that speaking was very difficult for me, it broke my back, because I was doing something which was against my own nature. I was sorting out sentences from Jesus; those which I could not support I never mentioned. Those which I could support, I supported them with all the growth of the twenty centuries after him.\nNaturally many Christians, priests, bishops, were influenced. They could not believe that a man who is not a Christian has such great insight into Jesus, his words, his implications. It was not like that. I was using Jesus only to catch fish in the big ocean of Christianity; I have done that with all the religions. And then for three years I became silent, just to know how many people were hanging around my words because they supported their belief system.\nIn my silence this woman was happy. She said, “While you were silent, I loved you. Since you have started speaking again you have destroyed my love.” So those who were here for their own ego fulfillment.… And the ego cannot be fulfilled by my silence; the ego need words, theologies, philosophy. She wants me to become silent again. She is furious. She wants me to be dead, but to be silent.\nSo in these three years I have sorted out my people, who can be with my silence. That means it does not matter to them whether I speak or not. It does not matter to them whether I say something which is against their conditioning or favoring their conditioning. They love me, not my words. Their communion is heart to heart.\nAnd when I saw all the camels have moved towards Santa Fe – Santa Fe has become a great camel camp – I thought that the moment has come to speak directly to you. And now I will be speaking directly to you.\nThere will be no Jesus between me and you, no Buddha between me and you, just a pure communion. Only then can I reach to your heart; otherwise, I can reach only to your mind – and mind has no function in bringing you blissfulness, ecstasy, enlightenment. Mind can give you better technology, but it cannot give you the New Man.\nI feel sorry for the woman, but she should understand that it is all her doing. I don’t know her even, she is not a sannyasin. And her love was false; she was still a Christian, and she was being supported by my meanings that I had put through Jesus’ mouth.\nI know I have been doing a very risky job. If ever Jesus, Buddha, Mahavira meet me, they are all going to attack me and kill me. They will forget all their messages of love, their messages of peace. And it will not be only Mohammed, it will be all those whom I have used. But there is no possibility of meeting these guys again.\nNow I can be human to you. I always wanted to be an authentic human being. There was never a desire to be a prophet, a messiah, an avatar, a godman. To me, all these words are four-letter words. I wanted just to be simple, ordinary – the way I am. I wanted to expose my heart to you without thinking what is going to be the consequence. This was possible only when I had found my own people, who can understand.\nYou are fortunate that you have remained. All the sannyasins around the earth are fortunate, because what they have listened to before was not the truth. I tried hard to put the truth... I interpreted those people, who were just crackpots – but it was compulsory. In this vast world, it is very difficult to find your own people. They are already belonging to some group, some theology, some religion. They have their own church, their own mosque, their own temple, and they have great investments there. They are hoping to attain paradise; they are afraid of falling into hell.\nWe are not interested in heaven and hell or God. There is no need to go to hell to experience it – you can just go driving on the county road and you will know what kind of roads exist in hell. You need not travel long to heaven – you can be just here, dancing, singing, rejoicing, and you know heaven has come to you.\nI emphasize the fact that nobody ever goes to heaven or hell. It is just vice versa: Hell comes to you, heaven comes to you. It is your doing, it is your heart that attracts it.\nHell is your misery, your suffering. Heaven is your rejoicing.\nI have also received another letter, one from a Zen master who wants to come and see me. And you will see the difference between a Christian, Mohammedan, Hindu, and a Zen monk.\nThe Zen monks have emphasized that they do not belong to Buddhism. In fact, Zen is a revolt against Buddhism. Buddha would not approve of these people, they are too human. They are so simple: chopping wood, drawing water from the well – you cannot conceive Buddha doing that.\nThis Zen master gives you a totally different vision. He is happy that I am here. He is immensely rejoiced that somebody is here who can even prevent the third world war. He just wants to sit by my side, to feel the vibe. He also knows what I am saying. He is also reading my books and he had read my old books too. But now he has decided that the time has come, that he should come here, because now I am speaking on my own authority. Now it is worth being close to a man who is not a commentator, but is an enlightened soul.\nHe says in his letter that Buddha had declared that he would be coming again after five thousand years. Twenty-five centuries have passed. The Zen monk declares, “We are exactly in the middle: twenty-five centuries back there was a Buddha, and perhaps twenty-five centuries ahead there will be a Buddha. And you seem to be the bridge, just exactly in the middle – twenty-five centuries.” He says he has not seen Buddha, but he would like to meet me, to have some taste of buddhahood, awakenedness.\nThis man has a totally different approach. He is a man of understanding, meditation. If he ever wants to burn, he will burn the old books and save the new ones, because the old books were commentaries, which I had to make under compulsion. Now it is no longer a commentary, I am telling you my experience. If Jesus or Buddha or Zarathustra agrees with me, good; if they don’t agree, they can go to hell.\nThey had all pretended to be higher than you, holier than you, more special than you. They fulfilled a great need in you: you wanted to follow somebody who was the only begotten son of God. By following the son of God you were also participating in something divine. I have dissolved the very idea of following. You are my fellow travelers.\nI want it to be declared throughout the earth, to all the corners of the earth, that someone has transcended, for the first time, even the experience of enlightenment – because that too is a way of creating distance, great distance: I am enlightened, you are not enlightened; I am always right, you are always wrong.\nYou are right as much as I am right. Accept the responsibility of your actions, of your thoughts, of your being, and fight every kind of trespass. You have to be yourself. If you cannot accept me being as human as you are just because I am enlightened, then I throw that enlightenment away. But I cannot allow you to be humiliated in a subtle way; I cannot allow you to go on becoming bigger egos. To hell with enlightenment!\nAnd I will do everything that will destroy it. No Buddha has laughed. What kind of miserable creatures...? No Buddha has danced. No Buddha has sung.\nYou just wait! You will be the first ones to see a buddha dancing. As your laughter and your love are making me stronger, soon I am going to dance. You should not be surprised when someday I appear in your disco or your playing cards room! I want to erase all kinds of stupidities that have arisen in the past, and have become bigger and bigger as time has passed.\nMy sannyasins and I are not different. Your faults are my faults, your errors are my errors. I accept you as you are; remember it, because if I come to your disco perhaps you will not be ready to accept me. I am preparing you for that, I don’t want you freaking out. It has been a long and hard struggle for me to find my people, I am not going in any way to freak them out.\nSlowly, slowly you will get accustomed to the idea that an enlightened man can come to a disco, dance with you, play cards with you, drink a little champagne with you. You should be immensely happy that you are with a man who claims no holier-than-thou attitude. It is ugly. There is nobody above human beings.\nI have always loved one statement of Chandidas. He was thought to be mad, because he declared: sabar uppe manu sut, tahar uppe nain – “Above all is the truth of man, and there is nothing above it.”\nAlthough he was in the past, I can recognize him as belonging to us, he is a contemporary. And he is courageous enough to enter the twenty-first century with us. What a great statement! SABAR UPPE MANU SUT... “Above all is the truth of man, and there is nothing above it.” He dissolved all gods, all angles. He recognized that man’s consciousness is the highest.\nYou don’t see it because you are asleep, but there is not much difference between the man who is asleep and the man who is awake. The man who is awake was asleep just few moments ago, the man who is asleep may be awakened just in a few moments, but there is no basic difference.\nI would like you to accept me as an ordinary human being. I don’t want to be a leader, I don’t want you to be led. I simply want to dance amongst you, completely lost.\nYou need not be afraid of me. All the followers of Jesus Christ were afraid of him, Buddha’s followers were afraid of him – because these people have been continuously nagging their disciples. I think if Mohammed, Buddha, Mahavira, Zarathustra, Krishna had been housewives, the world would have been far better. They would have nagged only one man, not the whole of humanity. I hate nagging!\nWhen I was a child and lived in a very small village where no train passes, no buses reach, my grandfather had a beautiful white horse. I used that white horse for roaming around the town, going along the river, going around the big lake. Slowly, slowly the horse started feeling some synchronicity with me. He started feeling when I wanted to return. But I never nagged even that horse. If he wanted to go north, I said, “Okay.” If he wanted to go around the lake, I said, “Okay, you decide, but I am not going to nag you against your wishes.”\nAnd it was a strange thing, that he always went to the place where I wanted to go. Between his consciousness and mine, something must have been transpiring. There was a communion without words. And if a horse can go to the place where I want, without my nagging and forcing him to go there, certainly... even if I am amongst you, don’t be afraid. All that is needed is not a superman to lead you, but a man with whom you can have a synchronicity. A subtle vibe of love joins you and me, and it will do miracles.\nI have been receiving letters from sannyasins: “It feels tremendously beautiful to see you as a human being just like us, but still somewhere I want you to be extraordinary, not ordinary. I want you to be higher than your disciples.” Why?\nMy being higher simply makes it difficult to communicate. That’s why all these people have failed. Jesus, Moses, Mohammed, Confucius, Lao Tzu – they all have failed, for a simple reason: they were there sitting on the clouds, and you were crawling on the earth. What communication is possible?\nThey maintained the distance; it was the fulfillment of their egos. And you stupidly wanted your prophet’s cloud to be higher than those of other prophets. But do you know what it means? It means your communication with your leader, prophet, messiah, is even more difficult.\nAll the religions have been trying to prove they are higher. Buddhists say, “Buddha is higher than Jesus, than Moses, then Mahavira.” And the other people are doing the same. I am starting a new history as far as enlightenment is concerned. The closer I am to you, holding your hand and dancing, the more is the possibility of communication.\nI am going to wake you, because I am so close to you. If I can dance with you, you cannot remain asleep long; it is risky for you and your sleep! If I can drink a little champagne with you, then our hearts can melt into each other.\nYou need not look above to God the father, who is always above the roofs – I don’t know what he is doing there! You can see me, look into my eyes, because I am standing on the same ground as you are. There is no distance, only a little difference – so little that I don’t care much about it.\nYou will be awakened. When I am so close to you, it is impossible for you to go on sleeping. I can shake you, I can hit you – I am so close. I can throw cold water in your eyes – I am so close. Buddha cannot do it; he is sitting on a white cloud far away.\nBut that has been the conspiracy between the masters and the disciples. The disciple really loves the master to be far away. That gives him a satisfaction: “I am no ordinary man’s follower, I follow an extraordinary master. Naturally, I am an extraordinary disciple.”\nIf you are with me, a man who says that he is an ordinary human being, I am destroying your ego. You cannot be an extraordinary disciple, you have to be ordinary. If your master himself is ordinary, what can you do? You have to be ordinary.\nAnd this is my basic experience, that to be ordinary is the most beautiful thing in existence. To be ordinary means to be relaxed. There is nowhere to go, nothing has to be found; you have it already. It was your ego that was blocking the way. Now the ego has disappeared, and you can see to your innermost being, crystal clear.\nSeeing it, you are going to laugh – what a joke life has played upon you! Life has put the kohinoor inside you, and given you the desire to search for the kohinoor. And you are running all over the world – to the churches, to the synagogues, to the monasteries, and doing all kinds of stupidities to find that which you have never lost, to find that which even if you want to lose, you cannot. It is your very being.\nI have heard about a man who was walking in the desert all alone... desert as far as he could see. It was his own shoes making noise – that was the only noise – but it appeared as if somebody was following him. It takes a little time; sound travels six hundred miles per hour, so when your shoe makes some sound you don’t hear it instantly, there is a gap. By the time you hear it your shoe has moved.\nHe was a logical, philosophic man. Certainly it was not the sound of his shoes; somebody was following him. He looked behind, saw his own shadow and figured out that this shadow seemed to\nbe some kind of ghost, because shadows are not known to make noise. He started running and the sound became louder. He looked back – the shadow was also running faster. He said, “My God! It means I am not running fast enough!”\nHe did his best, till he was almost spent and fell under a tree near an oasis. Now he was even more afraid, but he looked around: there was no noise, and the shadow was not there, for the simple reason that he was under the shadow of the tree. His shadow was so clear-cut under the sun on the sand, and here, when he was sitting under the tree, the shadow had left. He laughed. He understood that he had been making the noise himself, and the faster he ran, the louder the noise became – and it was his own shadow.\nThe moment you become enlightened, the first thing will be a mad laughter – that this is the thing you have been searching for for many lives, and you had it always in your pocket! All that is needed is just a little shaking. And I have found many ways to shaking you, to help you\nopen your eyes. And it is not a difficult job, in fact it is a great joy.\nTry with some sleeping man just brushing his cheeks with a toothbrush slowly, and see what happens to him – how he tries to throw it away. Just tickle his feet, and he pulls up his leg. Just start playing with his belly, and he is bound to open his eyes – how long can he keep them shut? How long can he remain asleep? What is going on? And he will also join in your laughter.\nI want you to live abundantly, with great laughter, rejoicing, and the only possibility is if your ego is destroyed. And the best way I have found is that I should be amongst you, not leading you, so that you forget completely that you are followers of a great master. I am perfectly ready to be your follower: you can walk ahead and I can follow you and do all kinds of tricks from the back – which is easier!\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nA LONG TIME AGO I REPLACED THE WORD GOD WITH SIMPLY “IT.” IT IS ABOUT AS VAST AS I CAN GO WITH MY MIND. DO I NEED TO ABOLISH IT AS WELL? – BECAUSE IT IS ALIVE AND ALL AROUND ME.\nThe first thing to be understood is that changing names does not change anything. You can call it God, you can call it Allah, you can call it Ishwar – there are three hundred languages on the earth. There are three hundred ways to call God, or you can invent your own private name for God.\nYou say, “I have replaced God with the word ’It.” What does it mean? You have only changed the label. Perhaps you can change even the container, but the question is of the content. And the content is there, I can see from your question, because you say, “it is alive and all around me.” Now, “it” is used for things. You have changed just the word; you are giving him a new name, but “It” is all alike.\nAnd the second thing you say is, “This is as far as my mind can go.” That’s true. Mind can play with words, that’s as far as it can go. It can never attain to the state of wordlessness. Your “It” will dominate you, will keep you in slavery just as God has done for so long.\nAnd the third thing... you ask me, “Should I drop ‘It’ also?” No, because then you will replace it by another word.\nThe women’s liberation movement uses for God, “She.” And I think it is a better word than “he”, because in “she,” “he” is present, but in “he”, the “she” is absent. “She” is a bigger word. It is symbolic: in “woman” the man is there, but in the word “man,” the woman is not there. But basically it does not make any difference – you can call God “she.” So I will not tell you to drop calling God “It.” It is not going to help in any way.\nI would like you to drop the mind which is playing this game of changing one word for another. Drop the mind! Nothing else can help. Forget about God. You don’t know him, you have not met him – how can you change his name, his address?\nYou are not to trespass the boundary. You cannot take it into your own hands, how God should be called. You don’t know anything about God, and you will never know, because God does not exist at all. So you are changing the name of something non-existential.\nIf you are so good at dropping from “he” to “It”, if you can even drop God from “he” to “It”.he\nstands for something, someone alive. It is used for things. If you can do such a great job, pulling down God from his golden throne, and making him a commodity in the market, then you can do a far easier thing: drop the mind.\nIt is a mind game, and the mind can play thousands of games. You reduce God to It, but from the back door the “It” becomes alive all around you. So what is the point? God is back. And it will give you great ego satisfaction that you managed something of immense importance: you have changed the name of God. It is not going to help. Your question is simply indicative of it. God has come from the back door, and is alive all around you.\nDrop the mind. That is meditation.\nIn meditation we don’t change the names of God. We don’t allow ourselves in meditation to be identified with the mind. We are the witness, and all games the mind plays are in front of the witness. The witness is separate from all games.\nYou can be a Christian; then, fed up with being a Christian, for a few years you can become a Hindu – “Hare Krishna, Hare Rama.” – anything new gives a certain excitement. But soon Hare Krishna or\nHare Rama is found in scientology – and you will not find him there long. If you go on following these people, perhaps now he is in EST. By the time you reach EST, the seeker has moved to Esalen. He will elude you, unless by some accident he ends up here. From here there is no way out.\nWe open the doors of inwardness, and the method is: just be watchful of your mind, how it fabricates philosophies, theologies, religions. Just watch. I am not telling you to do anything. In the beginning it is difficult, because you have never watched your mind. You have always thought you are the mind, you have always remained identified with the mind. So in the beginning it is going to be a little difficult, but it is not impossible. In fact, what you have done – identifying yourself with the mind – is something of the impossible. You have even managed that!\nWhat I am saying to you is simple, natural, possible. You are not the mind. And when mind stops, who is going to change the name of God? And who cares? When the mind is silent, not even a ripple of thought, that serenity, that silence will give you the first taste of godliness – not of God, because to taste God will reduce you to a cannibal.\nPlease, don’t try to eat God! But religions have been telling you to. Jesus, before departing from his company of fools, said to them, “Eat me, drink me.” Don’t do anything like that with me. I am an ordinary man, please – if you start eating me and drinking me, I will be finished soon. I will not last even one day.\nThe taste is not of God, but of godliness. That too, you simply experience and feel.\nIt is a quality, a quality that makes you aware of your immortality, that makes you aware of the infinity of existence, that makes you aware of utter beauty, grace, peace, blissfulness.\nBut there is no person like God. There is nobody, there is pure emptiness. And only pure emptiness or nothingness is what I have been calling enlightenment.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nYOU SAID RECENTLY THAT WOMEN’S LIBERATION WOULD BE MEN’S LIBERATION ALSO. WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT ON MEN’S LIBERATION?\nThis is one of the fundamental laws of life, that if you make anybody a slave, in return, unknowingly, you become a slave to your slave. Slavery is a double-edged sword. You cannot simply remain the master and the other a slave. You start becoming dependent on the slave. And to make somebody a slave is to create troubles for yourself, because the slave cannot love you, cannot respect you.\nThe slave will always hate you, the slave would like to kill you. He may not be able to, but these will be the thoughts moving around him. He may be bowing down to you, but deep in his heart he wants to destroy you, because freedom is an intrinsic necessity of every human being. Nobody can like slavery. One can pretend, just to save one’s neck, but one goes on gathering fire against the master.\nJesus was crucified... one never thinks about Judas – there are so many implications in it. Why did he sell Jesus for thirty pieces of silver? Certainly he was more valuable a man – crazy, but beautiful; harmless, but with a charismatic personality. A little bit off his head, but that is not a crime. And Judas had been with him for years as a disciple. Why did he betray him?\nMy understanding is that being a disciple is a kind of slavery, and there is a limit to how long one can tolerate it. And it is not only with Jesus that it has happened; otherwise, it would be just an exception, not the rule. But it is the rule, not the exception.\nMahavira’s own son-in-law tried to kill him. He had taken initiation and become a disciple. He was hoping that because he was the son-in-lawAnd Mahavira had only one daughter; she was also\ninitiated, they both were disciples. You can imagine, it is simple, that the son-in-law was hoping that Mahavira would declare him his successor. And when Mahavira declared that Gautam Gantha – a far more intelligent person – was going to be his successor, the son-in-law tried to kill him. And the son-in-law revolted against Mahavira, taking five hundred other disciples with him.\nNow, these five hundred disciples had also been with Mahavira for years. What was boiling within them, that rather than remaining with Mahavira they went with an idiot who had nothing to offer? And they all disappeared, evaporated, because he had nothing to offer. But they also must have been angry at the slavery that Mahavira was imposing on them.\nIn Jainism, things are really very strict. It is the most ascetic religion in the world. The Jaina monk has to remain naked in all the seasons around the year. It is difficult. The Jaina monk has to eat only one meal, begging. The Jaina monk cannot drink water in the night – even in the hot summers of Bihar where Mahavira was. As the sun sets, the Jaina monk cannot take anything in his mouth, not even water.\nThe Jaina monk, naked, with one meal a day, has to walk on hot days, on cold days, without any shoes – a naked man in shoes will look awkward. I have seen Jaina monks and nuns – their feet show the story of their asceticism: in the hot summer days they start bleeding, cracking.\nThese people who have had all these disciplines imposed on them are boiling within. They are following Mahavira because he is giving them the promise of moksha. You will be surprised that moksha is higher than what you know as paradise. So in Jainism there are three things: hell, the lowest; heaven, in the middle; and moksha, the ultimate.\nFrom heaven you are going to fall back again into life. It is a kind of spiritual holiday, a holiday place on a beautiful beach. You earn virtue – that is a bank balance of good deeds. When you have enough bank balance, you are born in heaven. But no bank balance can last forever; once your bank balance is finished you are thrown back to the earth again to be human beings.Moksha is liberation forever.\nThese poor people who had gathered around Mahavira were torturing themselves in every possible way, because this life is not long enough. So much time has passed... somebody is fifty; perhaps twenty years more, and then the eternal moksha, blissfulness forever, freedom forever.\nSo on the one hand they were doing all the austerities. But when you torture yourself, you cannot love the man really who has somehow manipulated you to torture yourself. When in the hot night you start feeling thirsty, you will curse this man – silently, of course. Even if you are sick, you cannot take medicine, because that is materialistic. You want to live in the body – that is materialistic. So if the body is falling apart, so far so good: the sooner you reach moksha.\nBut one thing is certain and simple, that these people will be gathering anger against the so-called tirthankara, Mahavira. So when his son-in-law left the fold, five hundred followed him.\nThe same is the case with Gautam Buddha. His own cousin-brother had taken initiation. The same mind, the same egoHe was older than Buddha, he had renounced his own kingdom – he had\nhad his own kingdom. He was hoping that he was going to be the successor. But slowly, slowly\nhe became aware that there were people like Sariputta, Mahakashyap, Moggalayan, who were very intimate with Gautam Buddha; there was not much chance for him. And he was not even worthy!\nHe left Gautam Buddha, and he also was followed by hundreds of monks. And this man tried in every way to kill Gautam Buddha. When Buddha was meditating one day under a tree in the valley by the side of a mountain, the cousin rolled a huge rock at him. The story is that the rock, seeing Buddha there, changed her route; Buddha was saved.\nI don’t think that rocks can change routes – what is more possible is that Buddha’s cousin-brother missed the target. And it is difficult to calculateIf from the high top of a mountain you roll a rock,\nthe target will not be necessarily hit, because the rock will come against other rocks, trees, and will be going this way and that way until it reaches the valley. So I don’t think that the rock was very compassionate.\nBuddha’s cousin used a mad elephant who was always kept in chains because he was very dangerous, he used to kill people. He brought the elephant near Gautam Buddha when he was sitting with closed eyes, and released the elephant.\nThe story is – but it is just a story – that the elephant, who was mad, came rushing, roaring towards Buddha. But as he saw Gautam Buddha he knelt down and touched Buddha’s feet. I don’t think that elephants are wiser than man. If the cousin-brother is not changed, what possibility is there for a mad elephant to change? Perhaps it was just out of his madness that he was doing it. You can expect from mad people anything.\nThe mad elephant may have seen so many people bowing down before Buddha and touching his feet. His screws were loose, but it is a well-known fact that elephants are very imitative. That’s why they are used in circuses; they learn to imitate very easily. You will not have seen camels in the circuses, for the simple reason that camels are just idiots. Elephants are imitative. So if this mad elephant did it, it simply shows imitation. He had seen so many people every day doing it to Buddha. He was mad enough not to bother about the cousin-brother who had released him – and he was not aware of the purpose either.\nWhat I am pointing at is that the moment you claim to be higher, stronger, better in comparison to someone else, you are creating an enemy.\nMan for centuries has been repressing the woman. Calling her the weaker sex, which is absolutely wrong: man is the weaker sex. But he has deprived the woman of education, deprived the woman of any financial independence, deprived the woman of the right to move in society freely, just as he moves. The woman is carrying immense anger accumulated for centuries, and she takes revenge in her own way. She nags the husband, she screams at him, she throws pillows at him. She turns the husband into a henpecked husband.\nSlavery is always mutual. Freedom is always mutual.\nSo I don’t make any distinction between women’s liberation and men’s liberation. These are two sides of the same coin. If the woman is liberated, man’s liberation follows automatically. If man\nwants not to be nagged, not to be screamed at, not to be a target of all kinds of things that the woman throws at him.And this is an everyday scene in every family.\nThe man has reduced the woman to a slave; the woman has her own ways to reduce him to a slave. If you see a couple walking on the road, you can decide without asking them whether they are married or not, whether the woman is a wife or a girlfriend. With the girlfriend the man is so happy – you can see it. With the wife he is so bored, so utterly sad, for the simple reason that this woman has made his life a hell. But who is responsible?\nFirst, you have made her a slave, now she is returning it to you in the same coins. Of course, the feminine way of taking revenge is different – her psychology is different. But no woman gives freedom to the husband. She keeps an eye on him – with whom he is talking, where he is going. She goes on looking at his coat to see if there is any woman’s hair on it. She goes on looking into his diary for phone numbers, and through phone numbers she easily can figure out with whom he is flirting.\nIt is an ugly relationship. Marriage is madness, because both are trying to overpower each other. The women can never forgive the man for what he has done to her: deprived her of education, deprived her of financial freedom, deprived her of her human dignity.\nSo if the woman has liberation, man automatically becomes liberated. There is no need for a man’s liberation movement, one movement is enough. That will help the man immensely. His joy will come back, he will be again chasing women, and that is the greatest game in the world. The poor man has to play tennis, football, volleyball, hockey – but nothing is a substitute! Chasing a woman is simply the most beautiful game.\nOnce marriage is dissolved completely and people are free to be with whomsoever they want to be – no barrier, no legality, no government, no society interfering – you will see this whole world smiling, happier, healthier, because you cannot get nourishment when you are in a state of slavery. Although you go on proclaiming to the world that you are the master of the house, you know perfectly well the moment you enter the house who is the master and who is the mistress. Certainly you are not the master.\nThis creates a strange split in you, it makes you a hypocrite. It makes you hurt, but that is an outcome of your own stupidity. Give freedom if you want freedom.\nJust one movement is enough. The woman’s liberation movement is enough, but it is not going in the right direction. It is not becoming a rebellion, it is becoming a reaction. The woman declares she is equal to man, so if the man is smoking she has to smoke; she is equal. If the man is drinking, she has to drink; she is equal. This is not rebellion, this is reaction.\nWomen are turning into lesbians. They feel so much hatred for men that millions of women don’t want to have any love relationship with men, they would prefer an unnatural and perverted relationship with a woman. And it is easier, because a man will never be able to suspect that his wife has a girlfriend. Even if the two women go on making love in the house, the husband will never suspect. But if a man comes on the scene and makes the triangle of all the stories and the films and the novels, it cannot be long before the husband discovers it.\nIt is the slavery of women that is turning the women towards lesbianism, but she thinks this is liberation from men. Dropping love for men is not liberation, you are becoming perverted.\nDrop the marriage contract, drop the license which has been issued by the court. Make your man free. Tell him, “It is up to you if you want to have any love relationships – I have no jealousy, no argument about it. But I demand the same for myself.” And if there is no slavery, no bondage between man and woman, perhaps there will be great love happening – as it happens in my commune.\nI don’t think so much love is happening anywhere else in the whole world, because nobody is jealous. People change their partners very easily. It is just a game: you get tired of playing tennis with one partner, you find another partner. And nobody is harmed, everybody is happy.\nYou will not find in my commune people who are sad, with long faces. Even Britishers in my commune are no more British. Even Proper Sagar is becoming improper!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7096","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/from_the_false_to_the_truth_467p/part33/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/from_the_false_to_the_truth_467p/>From The False To The Truth (467p)</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">33 You are my fellow travellers</h1><div class=post-meta>34 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7096 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/From_The_False_To_The_Truth_467p/part33.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part32>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

WITH US. BUT NEVER HAVE YOU TOLD IT TO US QUITE SO STRAIGHT, WITHOUT
CATERING TO OUR UNENLIGHTENED MORTAL STUPIDITIES. IS THIS THE
TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY VIBE?</p><p><br></p><p>You got it! This is the twenty-first century for me, and I am trying
to push you towards it.</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyasins should live ahead of time. The people who are burdened
with the past live five thousand years ago, ten thousand years ago, and
they are stuck there.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot live with the past. The past is dead, and to live with the
past is to be dead. The only life possible is in the present, and the
future is always changing into the present. It is always making the
twenty-first century in the twentieth century. The farther ahead you can
live in the moment, the more alive you will feel. And remember, it is
better to be red than dead!</p><p><br></p><p>I had to wait for you to behave humanly. I was waiting for my people,
because only they will understand that to be human is the highest value
there is.</p><p><br></p><p>I was talking to the Christians, to the Hindus, to the Mohammedans,
to the Jainas, to the Buddhists, and it was a difficult job. I could not
behave humanly with them. They wanted me to be their messiah, their
prophet, their messenger.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I received two letters. One was from a woman in
California. She said, “I have loved you for many years. I have been
reading all your books – how beautiful it was when you spoke on Jesus!
And now after three years of silence, what you are saying has enraged me
so much that I have burned all your books. I will pray to Jesus Christ
and God to forgive you. Perhaps you should go into silence again. And if
you don’t go into silence, then there is only one possibility for you to
be saved: that is, when you expire the silence will descend on your
grave.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now this woman had all my literature, had loved me, she thinks. But
do you think she loved me? She loved Jesus Christ, and because I had
spoken on Jesus Christ, putting myself behind him. putting my gun on his
shoulder, she was happy, immensely happy and grateful. The poor woman is
not aware of the fact that she had never been in tune with me. Because I
was speaking on Jesus as no one had spoken before, I was supporting her
mind, her tradition, and she was feeling immensely happy. I was
fulfilling her ego.</p><p><br></p><p>Now she is so against me, she has burned all the books, and she is
praying to Jesus Christ, the God, to forgive me. She should also burn
the house in which my books have been. They have already infected the
air and the house.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you feel that you are supported in some way, you are happy.
Hindus were happy, Mohammedans were happy, Christians were happy –
everybody was happy. And I am not here to make you happy.</p><p><br></p><p>I want you to be blissful. I want you to know yourself, to know this
vast existence. And you cannot know it being a Christian or a Hindu.
Your eyes are covered with layers of dust that centuries have poured
over you.</p><p><br></p><p>Now she is feeling very offended, but still she cannot see the point.
I had to speak on Jesus, Buddha, Mahavira, and hundreds of other
prophets, messiahs, saviors. But that speaking was very difficult for
me, it broke my back, because I was doing something which was against my
own nature. I was sorting out sentences from Jesus; those which I could
not support I never mentioned. Those which I could support, I supported
them with all the growth of the twenty centuries after him.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally many Christians, priests, bishops, were influenced. They
could not believe that a man who is not a Christian has such great
insight into Jesus, his words, his implications. It was not like that. I
was using Jesus only to catch fish in the big ocean of Christianity; I
have done that with all the religions. And then for three years I became
silent, just to know how many people were hanging around my words
because they supported their belief system.</p><p><br></p><p>In my silence this woman was happy. She said, “While you were silent,
I loved you. Since you have started speaking again you have destroyed my
love.” So those who were here for their own ego fulfillment.… And the
ego cannot be fulfilled by my silence; the ego need words, theologies,
philosophy. She wants me to become silent again. She is furious. She
wants me to be dead, but to be silent.</p><p><br></p><p>So in these three years I have sorted out my people, who can be with
my silence. That means it does not matter to them whether I speak or
not. It does not matter to them whether I say something which is against
their conditioning or favoring their conditioning. They love me, not my
words. Their communion is heart to heart.</p><p><br></p><p>And when I saw all the camels have moved towards Santa Fe – Santa Fe
has become a great camel camp – I thought that the moment has come to
speak directly to you. And now I will be speaking directly to you.</p><p>There will be no Jesus between me and you, no Buddha between me and
you, just a pure communion. Only then can I reach to your heart;
otherwise, I can reach only to your mind – and mind has no function in
bringing you blissfulness, ecstasy, enlightenment. Mind can give you
better technology, but it cannot give you the New Man.</p><p>I feel sorry for the woman, but she should understand that it is all
her doing. I don’t know her even, she is not a sannyasin. And her love
was false; she was still a Christian, and she was being supported by my
meanings that I had put through Jesus’ mouth.</p><p>I know I have been doing a very risky job. If ever Jesus, Buddha,
Mahavira meet me, they are all going to attack me and kill me. They will
forget all their messages of love, their messages of peace. And it will
not be only Mohammed, it will be all those whom I have used. But there
is no possibility of meeting these guys again.</p><p>Now I can be human to you. I always wanted to be an authentic human
being. There was never a desire to be a prophet, a messiah, an avatar, a
godman. To me, all these words are four-letter words. I wanted just to
be simple, ordinary – the way I am. I wanted to expose my heart to you
without thinking what is going to be the consequence. This was possible
only when I had found my own people, who can understand.</p><p>You are fortunate that you have remained. All the sannyasins around
the earth are fortunate, because what they have listened to before was
not the truth. I tried hard to put the truth... I interpreted those
people, who were just crackpots – but it was compulsory. In this vast
world, it is very difficult to find your own people. They are already
belonging to some group, some theology, some religion. They have their
own church, their own mosque, their own temple, and they have great
investments there. They are hoping to attain paradise; they are afraid
of falling into hell.</p><p>We are not interested in heaven and hell or God. There is no need to
go to hell to experience it – you can just go driving on the county road
and you will know what kind of roads exist in hell. You need not travel
long to heaven – you can be just here, dancing, singing, rejoicing, and
you know heaven has come to you.</p><p>I emphasize the fact that nobody ever goes to heaven or hell. It is
just vice versa: Hell comes to you, heaven comes to you. It is your
doing, it is your heart that attracts it.</p><p>Hell is your misery, your suffering. Heaven is your rejoicing.</p><p>I have also received another letter, one from a Zen master who wants
to come and see me. And you will see the difference between a Christian,
Mohammedan, Hindu, and a Zen monk.</p><p>The Zen monks have emphasized that they do not belong to Buddhism. In
fact, Zen is a revolt against Buddhism. Buddha would not approve of
these people, they are too human. They are so simple: chopping wood,
drawing water from the well – you cannot conceive Buddha doing that.</p><p><br></p><p>This Zen master gives you a totally different vision. He is happy
that I am here. He is immensely rejoiced that somebody is here who can
even prevent the third world war. He just wants to sit by my side, to
feel the vibe. He also knows what I am saying. He is also reading my
books and he had read my old books too. But now he has decided that the
time has come, that he should come here, because now I am speaking on my
own authority. Now it is worth being close to a man who is not a
commentator, but is an enlightened soul.</p><p><br></p><p>He says in his letter that Buddha had declared that he would be
coming again after five thousand years. Twenty-five centuries have
passed. The Zen monk declares, “We are exactly in the middle:
twenty-five centuries back there was a Buddha, and perhaps twenty-five
centuries ahead there will be a Buddha. And you seem to be the bridge,
just exactly in the middle – twenty-five centuries.” He says he has not
seen Buddha, but he would like to meet me, to have some taste of
buddhahood, awakenedness.</p><p><br></p><p>This man has a totally different approach. He is a man of
understanding, meditation. If he ever wants to burn, he will burn the
old books and save the new ones, because the old books were
commentaries, which I had to make under compulsion. Now it is no longer
a commentary, I am telling you my experience. If Jesus or Buddha or
Zarathustra agrees with me, good; if they don’t agree, they can go to
hell.</p><p><br></p><p>They had all pretended to be higher than you, holier than you, more
special than you. They fulfilled a great need in you: you wanted to
follow somebody who was the only begotten son of God. By following the
son of God you were also participating in something divine. I have
dissolved the very idea of following. You are my fellow travelers.</p><p><br></p><p>I want it to be declared throughout the earth, to all the corners of
the earth, that someone has transcended, for the first time, even the
experience of enlightenment – because that too is a way of creating
distance, great distance: I am enlightened, you are not enlightened; I
am always right, you are always wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>You are right as much as I am right. Accept the responsibility of
your actions, of your thoughts, of your being, and fight every kind of
trespass. You have to be yourself. If you cannot accept me being as
human as you are just because I am enlightened, then I throw that
enlightenment away. But I cannot allow you to be humiliated in a subtle
way; I cannot allow you to go on becoming bigger egos. To hell with
enlightenment!</p><p><br></p><p>And I will do everything that will destroy it. No Buddha has laughed.
What kind of miserable creatures...? No Buddha has danced. No Buddha has
sung.</p><p><br></p><p>You just wait! You will be the first ones to see a buddha dancing. As
your laughter and your love are making me stronger, soon I am going to
dance. You should not be surprised when someday I appear in your disco
or your playing cards room! I want to erase all kinds of stupidities
that have arisen in the past, and have become bigger and bigger as time
has passed.</p><p><br></p><p>My sannyasins and I are not different. Your faults are my faults,
your errors are my errors. I accept you as you are; remember it, because
if I come to your disco perhaps you will not be ready to accept me. I am
preparing you for that, I don’t want you freaking out. It has been a
long and hard struggle for me to find my people, I am not going in any
way to freak them out.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly, slowly you will get accustomed to the idea that an
enlightened man can come to a disco, dance with you, play cards with
you, drink a little champagne with you. You should be immensely happy
that you are with a man who claims no holier-than-thou attitude. It is
ugly. There is nobody above human beings.</p><p><br></p><p>I have always loved one statement of Chandidas. He was thought to be
mad, because he declared: sabar uppe manu sut, tahar uppe nain – “Above
all is the truth of man, and there is nothing above it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Although he was in the past, I can recognize him as belonging to us,
he is a contemporary. And he is courageous enough to enter the
twenty-first century with us. What a great statement! SABAR UPPE MANU
SUT... “Above all is the truth of man, and there is nothing above it.”
He dissolved all gods, all angles. He recognized that man’s
consciousness is the highest.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t see it because you are asleep, but there is not much
difference between the man who is asleep and the man who is awake. The
man who is awake was asleep just few moments ago, the man who is asleep
may be awakened just in a few moments, but there is no basic
difference.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like you to accept me as an ordinary human being. I don’t
want to be a leader, I don’t want you to be led. I simply want to dance
amongst you, completely lost.</p><p><br></p><p>You need not be afraid of me. All the followers of Jesus Christ were
afraid of him, Buddha’s followers were afraid of him – because these
people have been continuously nagging their disciples. I think if
Mohammed, Buddha, Mahavira, Zarathustra, Krishna had been housewives,
the world would have been far better. They would have nagged only one
man, not the whole of humanity. I hate nagging!</p><p><br></p><p>When I was a child and lived in a very small village where no train
passes, no buses reach, my grandfather had a beautiful white horse. I
used that white horse for roaming around the town, going along the
river, going around the big lake. Slowly, slowly the horse started
feeling some synchronicity with me. He started feeling when I wanted to
return. But I never nagged even that horse. If he wanted to go north, I
said, “Okay.” If he wanted to go around the lake, I said, “Okay, you
decide, but I am not going to nag you against your wishes.”</p><p><br></p><p>And it was a strange thing, that he always went to the place where I
wanted to go. Between his consciousness and mine, something must have
been transpiring. There was a communion without words. And if a horse
can go to the place where I want, without my nagging and forcing him to
go there, certainly... even if I am amongst you, don’t be afraid. All
that is needed is not a superman to lead you, but a man with whom you
can have a synchronicity. A subtle vibe of love joins you and me, and it
will do miracles.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been receiving letters from sannyasins: “It feels tremendously
beautiful to see you as a human being just like us, but still somewhere
I want you to be extraordinary, not ordinary. I want you to be higher
than your disciples.” Why?</p><p><br></p><p>My being higher simply makes it difficult to communicate. That’s why
all these people have failed. Jesus, Moses, Mohammed, Confucius, Lao Tzu
– they all have failed, for a simple reason: they were there sitting on
the clouds, and you were crawling on the earth. What communication is
possible?</p><p><br></p><p>They maintained the distance; it was the fulfillment of their egos.
And you stupidly wanted your prophet’s cloud to be higher than those of
other prophets. But do you know what it means? It means your
communication with your leader, prophet, messiah, is even more
difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions have been trying to prove they are higher.
Buddhists say, “Buddha is higher than Jesus, than Moses, then Mahavira.”
And the other people are doing the same. I am starting a new history as
far as enlightenment is concerned. The closer I am to you, holding your
hand and dancing, the more is the possibility of communication.</p><p><br></p><p>I am going to wake you, because I am so close to you. If I can dance
with you, you cannot remain asleep long; it is risky for you and your
sleep! If I can drink a little champagne with you, then our hearts can
melt into each other.</p><p><br></p><p>You need not look above to God the father, who is always above the
roofs – I don’t know what he is doing there! You can see me, look into
my eyes, because I am standing on the same ground as you are. There is
no distance, only a little difference – so little that I don’t care much
about it.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be awakened. When I am so close to you, it is impossible for
you to go on sleeping. I can shake you, I can hit you – I am so close. I
can throw cold water in your eyes – I am so close. Buddha cannot do it;
he is sitting on a white cloud far away.</p><p><br></p><p>But that has been the conspiracy between the masters and the
disciples. The disciple really loves the master to be far away. That
gives him a satisfaction: “I am no ordinary man’s follower, I follow an
extraordinary master. Naturally, I am an extraordinary disciple.”</p><p><br></p><p>If you are with me, a man who says that he is an ordinary human
being, I am destroying your ego. You cannot be an extraordinary
disciple, you have to be ordinary. If your master himself is ordinary,
what can you do? You have to be ordinary.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is my basic experience, that to be ordinary is the most
beautiful thing in existence. To be ordinary means to be relaxed. There
is nowhere to go, nothing has to be found; you have it already. It was
your ego that was blocking the way. Now the ego has disappeared, and you
can see to your innermost being, crystal clear.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing it, you are going to laugh – what a joke life has played upon
you! Life has put the kohinoor inside you, and given you the desire to
search for the kohinoor. And you are running all over the world – to the
churches, to the synagogues, to the monasteries, and doing all kinds of
stupidities to find that which you have never lost, to find that which
even if you want to lose, you cannot. It is your very being.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about a man who was walking in the desert all alone...
desert as far as he could see. It was his own shoes making noise – that
was the only noise – but it appeared as if somebody was following him.
It takes a little time; sound travels six hundred miles per hour, so
when your shoe makes some sound you don’t hear it instantly, there is a
gap. By the time you hear it your shoe has moved.</p><p><br></p><p>He was a logical, philosophic man. Certainly it was not the sound of
his shoes; somebody was following him. He looked behind, saw his own
shadow and figured out that this shadow seemed to</p><p><br></p><p>be some kind of ghost, because shadows are not known to make noise.
He started running and the sound became louder. He looked back – the
shadow was also running faster. He said, “My God! It means I am not
running fast enough!”</p><p>He did his best, till he was almost spent and fell under a tree near
an oasis. Now he was even more afraid, but he looked around: there was
no noise, and the shadow was not there, for the simple reason that he
was under the shadow of the tree. His shadow was so clear-cut under the
sun on the sand, and here, when he was sitting under the tree, the
shadow had left. He laughed. He understood that he had been making the
noise himself, and the faster he ran, the louder the noise became – and
it was his own shadow.</p><p>The moment you become enlightened, the first thing will be a mad
laughter – that this is the thing you have been searching for for many
lives, and you had it always in your pocket! All that is needed is just
a little shaking. And I have found many ways to shaking you, to help
you</p><p>open your eyes. And it is not a difficult job, in fact it is a great
joy.</p><p><br></p><p>Try with some sleeping man just brushing his cheeks with a toothbrush
slowly, and see what happens to him – how he tries to throw it away.
Just tickle his feet, and he pulls up his leg. Just start playing with
his belly, and he is bound to open his eyes – how long can he keep them
shut? How long can he remain asleep? What is going on? And he will also
join in your laughter.</p><p>I want you to live abundantly, with great laughter, rejoicing, and
the only possibility is if your ego is destroyed. And the best way I
have found is that I should be amongst you, not leading you, so that you
forget completely that you are followers of a great master. I am
perfectly ready to be your follower: you can walk ahead and I can follow
you and do all kinds of tricks from the back – which is easier!</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>A LONG TIME AGO I REPLACED THE WORD GOD WITH SIMPLY “IT.” IT IS ABOUT
AS VAST AS I CAN GO WITH MY MIND. DO I NEED TO ABOLISH IT AS WELL? –
BECAUSE IT IS ALIVE AND ALL AROUND ME.</p><p>The first thing to be understood is that changing names does not
change anything. You can call it God, you can call it Allah, you can
call it Ishwar – there are three hundred languages on the earth. There
are three hundred ways to call God, or you can invent your own private
name for God.</p><p>You say, “I have replaced God with the word ’It.” What does it mean?
You have only changed the label. Perhaps you can change even the
container, but the question is of the content. And the content is there,
I can see from your question, because you say, “it is alive and all
around me.” Now, “it” is used for things. You have changed just the
word; you are giving him a new name, but “It” is all alike.</p><p>And the second thing you say is, “This is as far as my mind can go.”
That’s true. Mind can play with words, that’s as far as it can go. It
can never attain to the state of wordlessness. Your “It” will dominate
you, will keep you in slavery just as God has done for so long.</p><p><br></p><p>And the third thing... you ask me, “Should I drop ‘It’ also?” No,
because then you will replace it by another word.</p><p><br></p><p>The women’s liberation movement uses for God, “She.” And I think it
is a better word than “he”, because in “she,” “he” is present, but in
“he”, the “she” is absent. “She” is a bigger word. It is symbolic: in
“woman” the man is there, but in the word “man,” the woman is not there.
But basically it does not make any difference – you can call God “she.”
So I will not tell you to drop calling God “It.” It is not going to help
in any way.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like you to drop the mind which is playing this game of
changing one word for another. Drop the mind! Nothing else can help.
Forget about God. You don’t know him, you have not met him – how can you
change his name, his address?</p><p><br></p><p>You are not to trespass the boundary. You cannot take it into your
own hands, how God should be called. You don’t know anything about God,
and you will never know, because God does not exist at all. So you are
changing the name of something non-existential.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are so good at dropping from “he” to “It”, if you can even
drop God from “he” to “It”.<span class=s4></span>he</p><p>stands for something, someone alive. It is used for things. If you
can do such a great job, pulling down God from his golden throne, and
making him a commodity in the market, then you can do a far easier
thing: drop the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a mind game, and the mind can play thousands of games. You
reduce God to It, but from the back door the “It” becomes alive all
around you. So what is the point? God is back. And it will give you
great ego satisfaction that you managed something of immense importance:
you have changed the name of God. It is not going to help. Your question
is simply indicative of it. God has come from the back door, and is
alive all around you.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop the mind. That is meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>In meditation we don’t change the names of God. We don’t allow
ourselves in meditation to be identified with the mind. We are the
witness, and all games the mind plays are in front of the witness. The
witness is separate from all games.</p><p><br></p><p>You can be a Christian; then, fed up with being a Christian, for a
few years you can become a Hindu – “Hare Krishna, Hare Rama.<span class=s4></span>” – anything new gives a certain excitement. But soon
Hare Krishna or</p><p>Hare Rama is found in scientology – and you will not find him there
long. If you go on following these people, perhaps now he is in EST. By
the time you reach EST, the seeker has moved to Esalen. He will elude
you, unless by some accident he ends up here. From here there is no way
out.</p><p><br></p><p>We open the doors of inwardness, and the method is: just be watchful
of your mind, how it fabricates philosophies, theologies, religions.
Just watch. I am not telling you to do anything. In the beginning it is
difficult, because you have never watched your mind. You have always
thought you are the mind, you have always remained identified with the
mind. So in the beginning it is going to be a little difficult, but it
is not impossible. In fact, what you have done – identifying yourself
with the mind – is something of the impossible. You have even managed
that!</p><p><br></p><p>What I am saying to you is simple, natural, possible. You are not the
mind. And when mind stops, who is going to change the name of God? And
who cares? When the mind is silent, not even a ripple of thought, that
serenity, that silence will give you the first taste of godliness – not
of God, because to taste God will reduce you to a cannibal.</p><p><br></p><p>Please, don’t try to eat God! But religions have been telling you to.
Jesus, before departing from his company of fools, said to them, “Eat
me, drink me.” Don’t do anything like that with me. I am an ordinary
man, please – if you start eating me and drinking me, I will be finished
soon. I will not last even one day.</p><p><br></p><p>The taste is not of God, but of godliness. That too, you simply
experience and feel.</p><p>It is a quality, a quality that makes you aware of your immortality,
that makes you aware of the infinity of existence, that makes you aware
of utter beauty, grace, peace, blissfulness.</p><p><br></p><p>But there is no person like God. There is nobody, there is pure
emptiness. And only pure emptiness or nothingness is what I have been
calling enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YOU SAID RECENTLY THAT WOMEN’S LIBERATION WOULD BE MEN’S LIBERATION
ALSO. WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT ON MEN’S LIBERATION?</p><p><br></p><p>This is one of the fundamental laws of life, that if you make anybody
a slave, in return, unknowingly, you become a slave to your slave.
Slavery is a double-edged sword. You cannot simply remain the master and
the other a slave. You start becoming dependent on the slave. And to
make somebody a slave is to create troubles for yourself, because the
slave cannot love you, cannot respect you.</p><p><br></p><p>The slave will always hate you, the slave would like to kill you. He
may not be able to, but these will be the thoughts moving around him. He
may be bowing down to you, but deep in his heart he wants to destroy
you, because freedom is an intrinsic necessity of every human being.
Nobody can like slavery. One can pretend, just to save one’s neck, but
one goes on gathering fire against the master.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was crucified... one never thinks about Judas – there are so
many implications in it. Why did he sell Jesus for thirty pieces of
silver? Certainly he was more valuable a man – crazy, but beautiful;
harmless, but with a charismatic personality. A little bit off his head,
but that is not a crime. And Judas had been with him for years as a
disciple. Why did he betray him?</p><p><br></p><p>My understanding is that being a disciple is a kind of slavery, and
there is a limit to how long one can tolerate it. And it is not only
with Jesus that it has happened; otherwise, it would be just an
exception, not the rule. But it is the rule, not the exception.</p><p><br></p><p>Mahavira’s own son-in-law tried to kill him. He had taken initiation
and become a disciple. He was hoping that because he was the
son-in-law<span class=s4></span>And Mahavira had only one daughter;
she was also</p><p><br></p><p>initiated, they both were disciples. You can imagine, it is simple,
that the son-in-law was hoping that Mahavira would declare him his
successor. And when Mahavira declared that Gautam Gantha – a far more
intelligent person – was going to be his successor, the son-in-law tried
to kill him. And the son-in-law revolted against Mahavira, taking five
hundred other disciples with him.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, these five hundred disciples had also been with Mahavira for
years. What was boiling within them, that rather than remaining with
Mahavira they went with an idiot who had nothing to offer? And they all
disappeared, evaporated, because he had nothing to offer. But they also
must have been angry at the slavery that Mahavira was imposing on
them.</p><p><br></p><p>In Jainism, things are really very strict. It is the most ascetic
religion in the world. The Jaina monk has to remain naked in all the
seasons around the year. It is difficult. The Jaina monk has to eat only
one meal, begging. The Jaina monk cannot drink water in the night – even
in the hot summers of Bihar where Mahavira was. As the sun sets, the
Jaina monk cannot take anything in his mouth, not even water.</p><p><br></p><p>The Jaina monk, naked, with one meal a day, has to walk on hot days,
on cold days, without any shoes – a naked man in shoes will look
awkward. I have seen Jaina monks and nuns – their feet show the story of
their asceticism: in the hot summer days they start bleeding,
cracking.</p><p><br></p><p>These people who have had all these disciplines imposed on them are
boiling within. They are following Mahavira because he is giving them
the promise of moksha. You will be surprised that moksha is higher than
what you know as paradise. So in Jainism there are three things: hell,
the lowest; heaven, in the middle; and moksha, the ultimate.</p><p><br></p><p>From heaven you are going to fall back again into life. It is a kind
of spiritual holiday, a holiday place on a beautiful beach. You earn
virtue – that is a bank balance of good deeds. When you have enough bank
balance, you are born in heaven. But no bank balance can last forever;
once your bank balance is finished you are thrown back to the earth
again to be human beings.Moksha is liberation forever.</p><p><br></p><p>These poor people who had gathered around Mahavira were torturing
themselves in every possible way, because this life is not long enough.
So much time has passed... somebody is fifty; perhaps twenty years more,
and then the eternal moksha, blissfulness forever, freedom forever.</p><p><br></p><p>So on the one hand they were doing all the austerities. But when you
torture yourself, you cannot love the man really who has somehow
manipulated you to torture yourself. When in the hot night you start
feeling thirsty, you will curse this man – silently, of course. Even if
you are sick, you cannot take medicine, because that is materialistic.
You want to live in the body – that is materialistic. So if the body is
falling apart, so far so good: the sooner you reach moksha.</p><p><br></p><p>But one thing is certain and simple, that these people will be
gathering anger against the so-called tirthankara, Mahavira. So when his
son-in-law left the fold, five hundred followed him.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is the case with Gautam Buddha. His own cousin-brother had
taken initiation. The same mind, the same ego<span class=s4></span>He
was older than Buddha, he had renounced his own kingdom – he had</p><p>had his own kingdom. He was hoping that he was going to be the
successor. But slowly, slowly</p><p><br></p><p>he became aware that there were people like Sariputta, Mahakashyap,
Moggalayan, who were very intimate with Gautam Buddha; there was not
much chance for him. And he was not even worthy!</p><p><br></p><p>He left Gautam Buddha, and he also was followed by hundreds of monks.
And this man tried in every way to kill Gautam Buddha. When Buddha was
meditating one day under a tree in the valley by the side of a mountain,
the cousin rolled a huge rock at him. The story is that the rock, seeing
Buddha there, changed her route; Buddha was saved.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t think that rocks can change routes – what is more possible is
that Buddha’s cousin-brother missed the target. And it is difficult to
calculate<span class=s4></span>If from the high top of a mountain you
roll a rock,</p><p>the target will not be necessarily hit, because the rock will come
against other rocks, trees, and will be going this way and that way
until it reaches the valley. So I don’t think that the rock was very
compassionate.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha’s cousin used a mad elephant who was always kept in chains
because he was very dangerous, he used to kill people. He brought the
elephant near Gautam Buddha when he was sitting with closed eyes, and
released the elephant.</p><p><br></p><p>The story is – but it is just a story – that the elephant, who was
mad, came rushing, roaring towards Buddha. But as he saw Gautam Buddha
he knelt down and touched Buddha’s feet. I don’t think that elephants
are wiser than man. If the cousin-brother is not changed, what
possibility is there for a mad elephant to change? Perhaps it was just
out of his madness that he was doing it. You can expect from mad people
anything.</p><p><br></p><p>The mad elephant may have seen so many people bowing down before
Buddha and touching his feet. His screws were loose, but it is a
well-known fact that elephants are very imitative. That’s why they are
used in circuses; they learn to imitate very easily. You will not have
seen camels in the circuses, for the simple reason that camels are just
idiots. Elephants are imitative. So if this mad elephant did it, it
simply shows imitation. He had seen so many people every day doing it to
Buddha. He was mad enough not to bother about the cousin-brother who had
released him – and he was not aware of the purpose either.</p><p><br></p><p>What I am pointing at is that the moment you claim to be higher,
stronger, better in comparison to someone else, you are creating an
enemy.</p><p><br></p><p>Man for centuries has been repressing the woman. Calling her the
weaker sex, which is absolutely wrong: man is the weaker sex. But he has
deprived the woman of education, deprived the woman of any financial
independence, deprived the woman of the right to move in society freely,
just as he moves. The woman is carrying immense anger accumulated for
centuries, and she takes revenge in her own way. She nags the husband,
she screams at him, she throws pillows at him. She turns the husband
into a henpecked husband.</p><p><br></p><p>Slavery is always mutual. Freedom is always mutual.</p><p>So I don’t make any distinction between women’s liberation and men’s
liberation. These are two sides of the same coin. If the woman is
liberated, man’s liberation follows automatically. If man</p><p><br></p><p>wants not to be nagged, not to be screamed at, not to be a target of
all kinds of things that the woman throws at him.<span class=s4></span>And this is an everyday scene in every family.</p><p><br></p><p>The man has reduced the woman to a slave; the woman has her own ways
to reduce him to a slave. If you see a couple walking on the road, you
can decide without asking them whether they are married or not, whether
the woman is a wife or a girlfriend. With the girlfriend the man is so
happy – you can see it. With the wife he is so bored, so utterly sad,
for the simple reason that this woman has made his life a hell. But who
is responsible?</p><p><br></p><p>First, you have made her a slave, now she is returning it to you in
the same coins. Of course, the feminine way of taking revenge is
different – her psychology is different. But no woman gives freedom to
the husband. She keeps an eye on him – with whom he is talking, where he
is going. She goes on looking at his coat to see if there is any woman’s
hair on it. She goes on looking into his diary for phone numbers, and
through phone numbers she easily can figure out with whom he is
flirting.</p><p><br></p><p>It is an ugly relationship. Marriage is madness, because both are
trying to overpower each other. The women can never forgive the man for
what he has done to her: deprived her of education, deprived her of
financial freedom, deprived her of her human dignity.</p><p><br></p><p>So if the woman has liberation, man automatically becomes liberated.
There is no need for a man’s liberation movement, one movement is
enough. That will help the man immensely. His joy will come back, he
will be again chasing women, and that is the greatest game in the world.
The poor man has to play tennis, football, volleyball, hockey – but
nothing is a substitute! Chasing a woman is simply the most beautiful
game.</p><p><br></p><p>Once marriage is dissolved completely and people are free to be with
whomsoever they want to be – no barrier, no legality, no government, no
society interfering – you will see this whole world smiling, happier,
healthier, because you cannot get nourishment when you are in a state of
slavery. Although you go on proclaiming to the world that you are the
master of the house, you know perfectly well the moment you enter the
house who is the master and who is the mistress. Certainly you are not
the master.</p><p><br></p><p>This creates a strange split in you, it makes you a hypocrite. It
makes you hurt, but that is an outcome of your own stupidity. Give
freedom if you want freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>Just one movement is enough. The woman’s liberation movement is
enough, but it is not going in the right direction. It is not becoming a
rebellion, it is becoming a reaction. The woman declares she is equal to
man, so if the man is smoking she has to smoke; she is equal. If the man
is drinking, she has to drink; she is equal. This is not rebellion, this
is reaction.</p><p><br></p><p>Women are turning into lesbians. They feel so much hatred for men
that millions of women don’t want to have any love relationship with
men, they would prefer an unnatural and perverted relationship with a
woman. And it is easier, because a man will never be able to suspect
that his wife has a girlfriend. Even if the two women go on making love
in the house, the husband will never suspect. But if a man comes on the
scene and makes the triangle of all the stories and the films and the
novels, it cannot be long before the husband discovers it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the slavery of women that is turning the women towards
lesbianism, but she thinks this is liberation from men. Dropping love
for men is not liberation, you are becoming perverted.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop the marriage contract, drop the license which has been issued by
the court. Make your man free. Tell him, “It is up to you if you want to
have any love relationships – I have no jealousy, no argument about it.
But I demand the same for myself.” And if there is no slavery, no
bondage between man and woman, perhaps there will be great love
happening – as it happens in my commune.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t think so much love is happening anywhere else in the whole
world, because nobody is jealous. People change their partners very
easily. It is just a game: you get tired of playing tennis with one
partner, you find another partner. And nobody is harmed, everybody is
happy.</p><p><br></p><p>You will not find in my commune people who are sad, with long faces.
Even Britishers in my commune are no more British. Even Proper Sagar is
becoming improper!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part32>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

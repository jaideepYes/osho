‌CHAPTER 1
It all depends on the disciple
1 April 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO BE MY MASTER IF I DO NOT WISH TO TAKE SANNYAS?
I think you do not understand the meaning of discipleship. You are asking something impossible. It is almost as if I ask you: Can you be my sannyasin if I don’t want to be your master?</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Blessed are the rich
8 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
CLERGYMAN OLDS GRANDLUND FROM SWEDEN HAS ASKED YOU A QUESTION. THE QUESTION HAS MANY QUESTIONS, SO I HAVE SEPARATED THEM. HE SAYS, “BELOVED OSHO, I HAVE MADE YOU SAD, BUT STILL I DON’T LIKE YOU TALKING BULLSHIT ABOUT MOTHER TERESA.”
Jesus!
Jesus used to teach his disciples, particularly the two fishermen who became his first disciples, how to catch men instead of catching fish.</description>

That explosion of bliss
9 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
J. KRISHNAMURTI HAS CRITICIZED YOU AND SAID THAT YOU ARE A SELF-APPOINTED MASTER. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY?
It seems that J. Krishnamurti has finally become senile. It is time too, he is ninety years old. What he has said is absurd. Who was appointed before me?</description>

‌CHAPTER 12
Doubt: the methodology of the seeker
10 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
I HAVE HEARD SWAMI PREM ANAM SAY ABOUT THE DISCOURSES THAT THEY ARE BORING, HE DOES NOT GET ANYTHING FROM THEM; THAT DISCOURSES ARE A WASTE OF TIME, AND HE PREFERS WORKERS’ DARSHAN.
COULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?
Anam is a confirmed creep. But what he is saying has much truth in it – not because the discourses are boring, but because he is not here.</description>

‌CHAPTER 13
Sympathy is a dirty word
11 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
YESTERDAY, THE WHOLE DAY I SAW MANY SANNYASINS GIVE SYMPATHY TO SWAMI PREM ANAM AFTER YOUR DISCOURSE. COULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?
Sympathy is not compassion; it is just the opposite. Sympathy is a kind of exploitation of the other person. When you sympathize with somebody, you are higher, better, and the other is lower, falling, degraded.</description>

We are here to be whole
12 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
CAN YOU IMAGINE YOURSELF BEING A RAJNEESHEE AND LIVING IN A COMMUNE?
It is impossible. I am simply an individual who belongs to no religion, to no caste, to no cult, to no nation. And I cannot belong to anybody, for the simple reason that I am completely content with myself.</description>

All promise for tomorrow are lies
13 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IT DISTURBS ME WHEN YOU DON’T SEEM TO BOTHER ABOUT FACTS.
You must be crazy! Why should it disturb you if it does not disturb me? It is true I have no respect for facts, for the simple reason that the fact is not the truth.</description>

‌CHAPTER 16
You have to grow inwards, that is your earth
14 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
THE GROWTH MOVEMENT HAS BEEN CALLED THE “NEW NARCISSISM” BY MANY, DUE TO ITS EMPHASIS ON ASSERTIVENESS AND VALUING ONE’S OWN PERSONAL EGO. HOW DOES YOUR WAY DIFFER?
There is no way. It is impossible to have a way, because you are already there.</description>

FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS I’VE LIVED IN YOUR COMMUNES. YOU ARE HERE, ALL MY FRIENDS ARE HERE; EVERYTHING I LOVE AND VALUE IS HERE. AND YET, I OFTEN THINK OF LEAVING. WHAT’S WRONG?
That’s what is wrong. You have all your friends here, all that you love, all that you have aspired to.</description>

‌CHAPTER 18
Silence does the miracle
16 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
ARE THESE ILLUSIONS OF GOD AND EGO ONE AND THE SAME?
Yes. The moment ego is found illusory, immediately God also disappears. Ego is an imaginary center in individuals, and God is the imaginary center of the whole universe. They are related to each other, dependent on each other.</description>

17 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
OUTSIDE, THEN INSIDE – BEAUTY, UTTER BEAUTY. IS THERE MORE?
There is no end to it.
There is infinitely more.
You cannot exhaust it.
But one condition has to be remembered: You should not ask for it. You should not see it, because it comes on its own.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Here we call work, worship
2 April 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IS WORSHIPPING IN THE COMMUNE RELATED TO MEDITATION? WHY DON’T WE HAVE ANY MEDITATION TIME SEPARATE FROM WORSHIPPING?
It has been one of the most dangerous ideas down the centuries that life can be divided into separate parts. Life is indivisible, it is an organic whole.</description>

18 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IF YOU ARE ONLY A FALLIBLE, ORDINARY MAN, AND NOT A GREAT MASTER, WHY ARE WE CALLED “THE CHOSEN FEW” WHO ARE GOING TO BE MESSENGERS OF RAJNEESHISM FOR THE WORLD AT LARGE? DOESN’T THIS FULFILL OUR EGOS?

19 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHEN I READ YOUR BOOKS I HAVE FELT GREAT LOVE FOR YOU. NOW THAT I AM HERE I FEEL LESS LOVE. SITTING IN DISCOURSE I FEEL MORE BACK PAIN THAN LOVE. AND LATELY I’VE BEEN FEELING A LOT OF FEAR, EVEN HATRED, OF YOU. I FEEL UNSURE OF YOU, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT “MY SANNYASINS.</description>

20 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
ARE YOU A MESSIAH, A PROPHET, OR A REINCARNATION OF GOD?
I have never expected that one of my sannyasins would ask such a bullshit question!
I am simply myself. I am not a messiah, because there is no God to send messengers to the world. Moreover, I don’t want to be crucified.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
THE WAY YOU WALK, IT SEEMS AS IF YOU ARE DRUNK. WHAT IS THE TRUTH?
Man, I am drunk! But not drunk with ordinary alcohol, marijuana, hashish, opium, LSD. I grow my own marijuana within me. No government can interfere with it. My source of drunkenness is my silence, my love, my centeredness, my rootedness in myself.</description>

First, if you want to be enlightened, you have to die a psychological death.</description>

NOW THAT GOD IS DEAD HOW CAN WE QUICKLY DISPOSE OF HIS REMAINS?

I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEVER OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL “ISMS.” DOES THIS INCLUDE RAJNEESHISM AS WELL?
Certainly. But you don’t understand one thing – Rajneeshism is not an “ism.” It is just because of the poverty of language that we had to call it Rajneeshism.</description>

‌CHAPTER 32
God: the need of the old man
30 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
MY MEMORY OF MY PARENTS WHEN I WAS YOUNG IS SO ALIVE. MY FATHER PAINTED AND WROTE POETRY. MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME DANCING. BOTH OF THEM WERE AGNOSTIC, AND NEVER TAUGHT ME RELIGION. NOW DIVORCED, THEY EACH LIVE IN QUIET DESPERATION, UNWILLING TO TAKE CHANCES.</description>

‌CHAPTER 33
You are my fellow travellers
31 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO
NEVER HAVE YOU SEEMED SO HUMAN, DANCING, LAUGHING AND CELEBRATING WITH US. BUT NEVER HAVE YOU TOLD IT TO US QUITE SO STRAIGHT, WITHOUT CATERING TO OUR UNENLIGHTENED MORTAL STUPIDITIES. IS THIS THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY VIBE?
You got it! This is the twenty-first century for me, and I am trying to push you towards it.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
Just drop the cross!
1 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
RAJNEESHISM IS PURELY A RELIGION OF CELEBRATION, SO WHY ARE SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD AGAINST IT?
That’s why! All the religions of the world have been religions of sado-masochism. They have created a miserable world. Their whole strategy is to make you convinced that this life is a life of sin.</description>

12 February 1989 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
OUR BELOVED MASTER,
WHEN IMPO TOOK LEAVE OF MA TZU, MA TZU ASKED, “WHERE ARE YOU GOING?” IMPO REPLIED, “I’M GOING TO SEKITO.”
MA TZU WARNED, “THE PATH ON THE STONE-HEAD IS SLIPPERY!”
IMPO SAID, “I HAVE THE POLE OF AN ACROBAT WITH ME – I CAN MAKE A SHOW WITH IT WHENEVER I WANT,” AND WITH THAT HE LEFT.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
Discontent: another name for inferiority complex
2 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
DO YOU EVER GET SAD?
Really a tough question! Yes and no. Yes, I get sad for you and for the world in which you are living. And you are not aware that you are living in the midst of a vast madhouse. You are so fast asleep, you don’t know what is being done to you, to others.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
Contentment is a state of consciousness
3 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IF DISCONTENTMENT DOES NOT LEAD TO REAL PROGRESS, THEN IS THE CONTENTED MAN THE ALTERNATIVE?
No. The religions of the world have tried to create the contented man. The contented man is really the repressed man. He has all the desires, all the ambitions, but he is repressing them.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
A sannyasin is extraordinarily ordinary
4 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
I CAN’T CONCEIVE OF YOU EVER BEING UNENLIGHTENED. DID YOU REALLY BECOME ENLIGHTENED ONLY THIRTY-TWO YEARS AGO?
Neither can I conceive it. This is one of the very fundamental things in the nature of enlightenment. Once you are enlightened, you are in a very strange situation – trying to conceive how you could manage to remain unenlightened for so many lives.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
With me begins a new era of enlightenment
5 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHY HAVEN’T OTHER ENLIGHTENED MASTERS TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT GOD, JESUS, HEAVEN AND HELL?
The phenomenon of enlightenment is very rare. It should not be so, because everyone is born enlightened and then enters into a dark tunnel of religions, cultures, civilizations, education. Enlightened you are born, unenlightened you die.</description>

7 July 1985 am in Rajneeshmandir
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IT HAS BEEN MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MEDITATOR AND THE LOVER HAVE DIFFERENT PATHS. THE OTHER DAY WE HEARD YOUR BEAUTIFUL EXPLANATION OF THE PATH OF MEDITATION. IS THIS PATH DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE LOVER? IF SO, HOW TO TELL WHICH PATH TO CHOOSE?</description>

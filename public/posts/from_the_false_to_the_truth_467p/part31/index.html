WILL IT EVER BE POSSIBLE THAT MAN CAN FUNCTION FROM A BLEND OF BOTH HEAD AND HEART, OR MUST THE TWO ALWAYS REMAIN TOTALLY DIVORCED? WILL IT ALWAYS BE ESSENTIAL TO MAKE A CONSCIOUS CHOICE FOR ONE WAY OR THE OTHER?\nThe first thing to be understood is that there is no way, either of head or of heart. Every way leads you away, away from the truth that you are.\nIt would have been so easy if there were a truth somewhere. Howsoever difficult the way, people would have reached. The more difficult, the more far away the truth was, the more challenging to the ego. If man’s ego challenges him to reach the highest peak in the Himalayas, Everest, where nothing is to be found; if man’s ego gives him incentive to waste billions of dollars to reach the moon, risking lives.… But man has reached the moon. And the first man who walked on the moon must have looked silly to himself – there was nothing for which so much endeavor, technology, preparation was needed.\nRemember, the ego wants challenges. It lives through challenge.\nWhy have so few people been able to have a glimpse of the truth? – because it is not a challenge; it is not there, it is here within you. It does not need any way, you are already it.\nBut the question has one other implication too: Will it ever be possible for the head and heart to be married, or are they going to remain forever divorced? It all depends on you, because both are mechanisms. You are neither the head nor the heart. You can move through the head, you can move through the heart. Of course you will reach different places because the directions of the head and the heart are diametrically opposite.\nThe head will go round and round thinking, brooding, philosophizing; it knows only words, logic, argument. But it is very infertile; you cannot get anything out of the head as far as truth is concerned, because truth needs no logic, no argument, no philosophical research. Truth is so simple; the head makes it so complex. Down the centuries philosophers have been seeking and searching for the truth through the head. None of them has found anything, but they have created great systems of thought. I have looked into all those systems: there is no conclusion.\nThe heart is also a mechanism – different from the head. You can call the head the logical instrument; you can call the heart the emotional instrument. Out of the head all the philosophies, all the theologies are created; out of the heart, come all kinds of devotion, prayer, sentimentality. But the heart also goes round and round in emotions.\nThe word “emotion” is good. Watch... it consists of motion, movement. So the heart moves, but the heart is blind. It moves fast, quick, because there is no reason to wait. It does not have to think, so it jumps into anything. But truth is not to be found by any emotionality. Emotion is as much a barrier as logic.\nThe logic is the male in you, and the heart is the female in you. But truth has nothing to do with male and female. Truth is your consciousness. You can watch the head thinking, you can watch the heart throbbing with emotion. They can be in a certain relationship.…\nOrdinarily, the society has arranged that the head should be the master and the heart should be the servant, because society is the creation of man’s mind, psychology, and the heart is feminine. Just as man has kept the woman a slave, the head has kept the heart a slave.\nWe can reverse the situation: the heart can become the master, the head can become the servant. If we have to choose between the two, if we are forced to choose between the two, then it is better that the heart becomes the master and the head becomes the servant.\nThere are things which the heart is incapable of. Exactly the same is true about the head. The head cannot love, it cannot feel, it is insensitive. The heart cannot be rational, reasonable. For the whole past they have been in conflict. That conflict only represents the conflict and struggle between men and women.\nIf you are talking to your wife, you must know it is impossible to talk, it is impossible to argue, it is impossible to come to a fair decision, because the woman functions through the heart. She jumps from one thing to another without bothering whether there is any relationship between the two. She cannot argue, but she can cry. She cannot be rational, but she can scream. She cannot be cooperative in coming to a conclusion. The heart cannot understand the language of the head.\nThe difference is not much as far as physiology is concerned, the heart and the head are just a few inches apart from each other. But as far as their existential qualities are concerned, they are poles apart.\nMy way has been described as that of the heart, but it is not true. The heart will give you all kinds of imaginings, hallucinations, illusions, sweet dreams – but it cannot give you the truth. The truth is behind both; it is in your consciousness, which is neither head nor heart. Just because the consciousness is separate from both, it can use both in harmony. The head is dangerous in certain fields, because it has eyes but it has no legs – it is crippled.\nThe heart can function in certain dimensions. It has no eyes but it has legs; it is blind but it can move tremendously, with great speed – of course, not knowing where it is going. It is not just a coincidence that in all the languages of the world love is called blind. It is not love that is blind, it is the heart that has no eyes.\nAs your meditation becomes deeper, as your identification with the head and the heart starts falling, you find yourself becoming a triangle. And your reality is in the third force in you: the consciousness. Consciousness can manage very easily, because the heart and the head both belong to it.\nYou know the story of a blind beggar and a crippled beggarThey both lived outside the village in\nthe forest. Of course, they were competitors to each other, enemies – begging is a business. But one day the forest was on fire. The cripple had no way to escape, because he could not move on his own. He had eyes to see which way they could get out of the fire, but what use is that if you don’t have legs? The blind man had legs, could move fast and get out of the fire, but how was he going to find the place where the fire had not reached yet?\nBoth were going to die in the forest, burned alive. It was such an emergency that they forgot their competition. In such emergencies only a Jew can remain a businessman, and certainly those two beggars were not Jews. In fact, to be a beggar and a Jew is a contradiction in terms.\nThey immediately dropped their antagonism – that was the only way to survive. The blind man took the cripple on his shoulders, they found the way out of the fire. One was seeing, and the other was moving accordingly.\nSomething like this has to happen within you – of course, in reverse order. The head has the eyes, the heart has the guts to move into anything. You have to make a synthesis between the two. And the synthesis, I have to emphasize, should be that the heart remains the master, and the head becomes the servant.\nYou have as a servant a great asset – your reasoning. You cannot be befooled, you cannot be cheated and exploited. The heart has all feminine qualities: love, beauty, grace. The head is barbarous. The heart is far more civilized, far more innocent.\nA conscious man uses his head as a servant, and his heart as the master – just the opposite of the story I told you.\nAnd this is so simple for the man of consciousness to do. Once you are unidentified with head or heart, and you are simply a witness of both, you can see which qualities should be higher, which\nqualities should be the goal. And the head as a servant can bring those qualities, but it needs to be commanded and ordered. Right now, and for centuries, just the opposite has been happening: the servant has become the master. And the master is so polite, such a gentleman, that he has not fought back, he has accepted the slavery voluntarily. The madness on the earth is the result.\nWe have to change the very alchemy of man. We have to rearrange the whole inside of man.\nAnd the most basic revolution in man will come when the heart decides the values. It cannot decide for war, it cannot go for nuclear weapons; it cannot be death-oriented. The heart is life’s juice. Once the head is in the service of the heart, it has to do what the heart decides. And the head is immensely capable of doing anything, just right guidance is needed; otherwise, it is going to go berserk, it is going to be mad. For the head there are no values. For the head there is no meaning in anything. For the head there is no love, no beauty, no grace – only reasoning.\nBut this miracle is possible only by disidentifying yourself from both. Watch the thoughts, because in your watching them, they disappear. Then watch your emotions, sentimentalities; by your watching, they also disappear. Then your heart is as innocent as that of a child, and your head is as great a genius as Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, Aristotle.\nBut the trouble is far bigger than you can conceive. It is a male-dominated society; man has been creating all the rules of the game, the woman has just been following. And the conditioning has gone so deep, because it has been going on for millions of years.\nIf in the individual the revolution happens and the heart is re-enthroned, given its right place as the master, and the head given the right place as a great servant, this will affect your whole social structure. You can see it happening in my commune.\nThe woman is the master; she is not longer mistress, and the man is no longer master. People go on asking me why, for all significant posts, I have chosen women? For the simple reason that the woman will not create the third world war.\nIt has been a historical fact that each war is created by the man, but the woman suffers most. Strange – the man is the criminal and the consequence happens to the woman! The woman loses her husband, the woman loses her children. The woman loses her dignity, because whenever a country is invaded, the soldiers are so much repressed – just like the monksSexually they had\nno opportunity while the war was going on. When the opportunity arises – they invade a city and conquer it – their first attack is on the woman.\nAnd the war has nothing to do with the woman, she is simply outside of the game – it is a male game, just like boxing – but she has to be raped. Those soldiers are hankering not to be victorious for their nation’s glory – that is a faraway thing – they are hankering to get the women of the enemies as quickly as possible.\nI am putting women in all significant, powerful positions. It is symbolic. Man has a tremendous capacity to do things, but he should not be the guide anymore. He is hung up in his head. He\ncan also become the master if he puts his heart above his head. That’s why I said that all of my sannyasins are women – even those who biologically, physiologically, are men. The moment they become sannyasins they have accepted a new structure, they have put something above their head – their heart.\nThis is what I mean: that even men around me start learning feminine qualities. And feminine qualities are the only qualities worth having.\nSo there is a possibility, but the possibility has a basic condition to be fulfilled: you become more conscious, a witness, a watcher of all that goes on inside you. The watcher becomes immediately free from identification. Because he can see the emotions, it is an absolute certainty that “I am not the emotions.” He can see the thoughts; the simple conclusion is, “I am not my thought process.”\n“Then who am I?” – a pure watcher, a witness. And you reach to the ultimate possibility of intelligence in you: You become a conscious man.\nAmongst the whole world sleeping, you become awake, and once you are awake there is no problem. Your very awakening will start shifting things to their right places. The head has to be dethroned, and the heart has to be crowned again. This change amongst many people will bring a new society, a New Man in the world. It will change so many things, you cannot conceive.\nScience will have a totally different flavor. It will not serve death anymore, it will not make weapons that are going to kill the whole of life on the earth. It will make life richer, discover energies which can make man more fulfilled, which can make man live in comfort, in luxury, because the values will have completely changed. It will still be mind functioning, but under the direction of the heart.\nMy way is the way of meditation.\nI have to use language, unfortunately, that’s why I say may way is the way of meditation: Neither of head nor of heart, but of a growing consciousness which is above both mind and heart.\nThis is the key to open the doors for a New Man to arrive on the earth. Question 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nI WAS BROUGHT UP AS A QUAKER, AND WE WERE TOLD NEVER TO SWEAR ON A BIBLE IN COURT, BECAUSE AS QUAKERS WE COULD ONLY SPEAK THE TRUTH, AND THAT THE SOURCE OF OUR TRUTH WAS SILENCE. THIS IS SO CLOSE TO WHAT YOU SAY, I AM SURPRISED WHEN YOU SAY YOU DON’T AGREE WITH THE THEOLOGY OF QUAKERISM.\nI am also surprised.\nThe first thing: Quakerism is part of Christian theology. I have never said anything against Quakerism, but you are forcing me to now.\nIt is a by-product of Christian theology, and I am against all theologies. Quakerism is not an independent religion, but just a sect of Christianity. It accepts all kinds of stupidities that are propounded by Jesus and his theologians. It is not against THE BIBLE – and THE BIBLE is so full of rubbish, lies.\nThe basic lie is God, the holy ghost, Jesus the only begotten son of God. Lies upon lies – a virgin birth, resurrection after being crucified. Quakerism does not deny all these things, it accepts them.\nSecondly, you are saying you have been told not to take oath upon the BIBLE in the court. I have also said that the oath is absolutely unnecessary. A man who is capable of lying – no oath can prevent him. And to take an oath placing your hand on THE BIBLE is hilarious. THE BIBLE is so full of lies, and you are taking an oath for truth – that you will not speak anything but truth!\nMy reason not to take an oath on any religious scripture is totally different from that of the Quakers. The Quakers believe – remember, they believe: I know. You have been told: I have seen.\nAnd the difference is infinite between being told and experiencing it on your own.\nJust by being told that because you are a Quaker whatsoever you speak will be truth.… This is strange. It is a belief, borrowed knowledge, conditioning. Just by your being a Quaker, it is not a certainty that whatsoever you speak will be the truth.\nYes, if you have experienced total silence, then nothing can come out of you which is not true.\nBut I know many Quakers. They sit in silence also in their congregations. I have been to their congregations, and I have asked them, “If you are really truthful, tell me: What were you doing in your silence?” And they have always said, “We were thinking – thinking of silence, trying to be silent, making efforts to be silent.” Yes, it is true they are not speaking. If you mean just by not speaking you are silent, then you are just a fool.\nSilence is such a deep experience, where thoughts, emotions, everything disappears. If you have attained to that silence you will not even call yourself a Quaker. You will not subscribe to any theology. You don’t need one; you have found the very source of truth within yourself.\nThe Quakers have been defying the court; they will not take the oath. They have been punished for it, because it is an insult to the court, it is contempt of the court: they have been imprisoned, tortured. But the Quaker and my sannyasin are totally different.\nI say the oath is useless. But I teach my sannyasins to be nonserious. To the Quakers it has become something of a dogmatic idea, a fanatic standpoint: they will not take the oath. I tell my sannyasins, “You live in a society, you have to follow their rules – remembering that they are all man-made.”\nFor example, in some countries you have to drive on the right side of the road, in some countries on the left side of the road. What is wrong with the right side? You can say that it makes no difference whether you drive on the right side or left side, it is simply a rule. Don’t Quakers follow this simple rule? You don’t take it seriously, there is no problem in it; it is simply a question of managing the traffic. It can be done in both ways, so there is nothing serious about it. It is not something like an ultimate law of existence, that if you drive on the right side you will go to hell.\nQuakers have been going to jail. I will not tell my sannyasins to do that. It is not worth it. Take the oath, and say whatsoever you want to say. Oath or no oath, it makes no difference to your statements. Why unnecessarily enrage those poor judges and juries? Let them be satisfied. If they are feeling happy just by your taking an oath, and feeling that now whatever you say will be the truth, let them befool themselves. You have to say what you want to say. The oath is irrelevant to you, but why make so much fuss about it that you have to go for two years behind bars?\nI am a nonserious man. Quakers are very serious about it. They will risk their life, but they will not take the oath. The oath has become more important than life itself.\nIt is just a game. You play cards: there is a king and there is a queen and there is a joker, and all sorts of people are there. You know that this is just a playing card, and this queen is just like the queen of England – absolutely meaningless, powerless. But while playing the game you have to accept that this is the queen, this is the king, this is the joker, and so on, so forth. You don’t start going to jail because “I will not accept this card as the king!” It is up to you – don’t play the game.\nThese are all games. That is the difference. You are asking me what the difference is, why I criticize Quaker theology. In fact, I have never done it before, but from now onwards I am going to do it unless you start quaking! To take games of life seriously shows only your stupidity, not your silence.\nI have been in the courts. I have taken an oath, but before I take the oath I certainly make a statement telling the judge, “I will follow the rule, I will take the oath, but the oath cannot make any difference to me. I will speak only that which I want to speak.\n“And your oath, in fact, frees me from telling the truth and only the truth, because the oath I am taking on THE BIBLE, on the GITA, on the KORAN – which are full of lies... naturally by taking the oath on THE BIBLE I am completely freed. Now I can lie without any trouble. Without an oath I will only speak the truth; with an oath, there is no need because I have already lied by putting my hand on THE BIBLE.”\nQuakers are not against THE BIBLE – I am. In one court I refused to put my hand on THE BIBLE. I said, “I will keep a little distance.”\nThe judge asked, “Why?”\nI said, “Because it is such garbage I don’t want to touch it. It is your rule, so I will put my hand on top of it, but I will keep a little distance. I am very allergic.” There is an immense difference between my criticism of this system of oath taking and the Quakers’ criticism.\nI am not saying that just because you are a sannyasin that’s enough to guarantee that you will speak only the truth, no. Just being sannyasins does not mean that you will only speak the truth. And it is not so easy to decide what the truth is.\nIt happened that one of the great historians was writing the history of the whole world. It was an immense job to write the whole history of the whole world, of all the nations. He devoted almost fifty years, working almost twelve, fourteen hours a day. And the day he was coming to his last page, something happened and he burned his whole life’s effort.\nSomebody was murdered just in the neighborhood. Of course, so many people gathered there: the police were there, the journalists were there. The historian also went there. He asked one person who was an eyewitness, he asked another person who was an eyewitness – and he was amazed. The stories of all the eyewitnesses were different. And there was no reason for them to lie, they were not involved in it.\nOne eyewitness said he was killed inside the house. Another eyewitness said he was killed under the sky, the open sky. The truth was that he was killed in a house which was just being built, and the roof was not yet there. He was killed under the open sky – without the roof you can’t call it a house. But it was a house in the process of being built. The roof is only a part of the house, so the other was not lying either, saying that he was killed inside the house.\nListening to other eyewitnesses, he became suddenly aware of one thing: “A murder happens in my neighborhood; within two minutes’ time I am there, eyewitnesses are available – and it cannot be decided what actually happened. I have been wasting my whole life writing about Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, Nadir Shah – so much time has passed. Can I say truthfully that what I have written is factual? Perhaps many of these people never existed!”\nGeorge Gurdjieff had a theory about Jesus Christ: that he never existed, that it is only an ancient drama which was played amongst the Jews, there has never been a historical man Jesus. And he supported his idea that it is only a drama, just like the dramas of Shakespeare and Bernard Shaw. His first piece of evidence was that Jesus is not mentioned in any Jewish book.\nSuch a man, who could walk on water, do you think he would not create news? Would he not be mentioned somewhere in the contemporary literature? A man who can raise the dead back to life – if he is not mentioned, then who else will be mentioned? This man was doing all kinds of miracles: turning stones into bread, turning water into wineAnd the resurrection – he was crucified but God\nwould not allow his only begotten Son to be dead, so he came back again.\nThese things make a man so significant that you cannot ignore him, yet in no Jewish history he is even mentioned, not even in the footnotes! George Gurdjieff has an argument there; he says it is simply a drama. Nobody has been able to criticize George Gurdjieff; you cannot find anything that can contradict what he is saying. So what is the truth?\nTake the oath; if that is the rule of the game, play it accordingly. But make it clear that it makes no difference to you.\nPerhaps it was making a difference to people in the past. And I say to you, it will make a difference to the Quakers too, because they believe in THE BIBLE, they believe in the biblical God, they believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The whole Christian theology is theirs.\nIf you believe in God, you feel afraid taking the oath in the name of God – the superstitious man will feel afraid: now it is not a question of the court, it is now a question of God and the holy book. To lie now will not only be a crime, it will be a sin also. Afraid of this, there is a possibility he will say the truth.\nFor my sannyasins there is no problem. There is no God, there is no holy book. My sannyasins can take an oath on any novel and it will be the same. They can take an oath on anything, it makes\nno difference at all; they will say what they want to say. The court cannot exploit their superstitions, because they have none.\nThe oath was significant, is significant, for the so-called religious people of the world. And that’s why a Hindu is not given THE BIBLE to take an oath on. He is given the GITA, because THE BIBLE he can spit on without any trouble. But the GITA? If by accident the GITA falls from his hands, or his feet by accident touch the GITA, he is in tremendous anguish. He has to fast, and go to the holy Ganges river to take a bath: he has committed a great sin.\nNow, this man can be exploited. The court can manipulate this man to tell the truth. But no court in the whole world can manipulate my people. We don’t have any holy book, we don’t have any God to be afraid of. Once you are free of superstitions, laughingly you can take the oath and say whatsoever you always wanted to say – oath or no oath. So remember, there is a difference.\nAnd if the court is stubborn, don’t take it seriously. It is stupid to suffer two years in jail just for not taking the oath. And why are you so afraid? Are you afraid because you were going to lie, and now after the oath you cannot lie? What is the fear?\nYou say, “I have been told that the Quaker only speaks the truth.” You have been told – and the man who has told you was lying! Just being a Quaker makes no difference. How can it make any difference? Yes, Quakers sit in silence, but I know their silence is bogus, because they don’t have the method to enter into silence. They just say, “We sit in silence.” Yes, they are not talking, but they are thinking, they are feeling – emotions are there.\nSilence means you are a witness, and that word “witness” has no place in the Quaker theology. And without being a witness you cannot be silent; there is no other way. You will have to go through the whole process of witnessing; only then, slowly, slowly, things will start dropping away.\nMy people know that unless they succeed in meditation – which is another name of witnessing – they will remain unconscious, and an unconscious man is asleep. Can you say to a man who is just getting ready to fall into bed and go to sleep, can you tell the man, “Please take an oath that you will not dream about wrong things”? He may take the oath, but he will be dreaming in the same way as he was dreaming before.\nThe oath will not make any difference, because the oath is taken by the conscious mind, and there are deeper layers which know nothing about it. The unconscious mind has no idea about the oath, and the collective unconscious mind is far deeper, and the cosmic unconscious mind is deeper than the Pacific. They know nothing about your oath, and in sleep they will be functioning, not your conscious mind. Your conscious mind, which has taken the oath, will be asleep.\nSleepy people, unconscious people, can believe in anything, but their belief makes no difference to their inner reality.\nSo please, forget the idea that my opposition to the oath is the same as the Quakers’ opposition to the oath. Their opposition has different arguments for it. They say, “Because a Quaker always speaks the truth, that’s why we will not take the oath.”\nI say to my sannyasins, “Make the statement in the court: ’The oath is a very ancient superstition. I will take it, if this is the game that I have to play, but I cannot be serious about it. It does not matter – you can give me THE BIBLE or you can give me PLAYBOY magazine, it won’t make any difference; I will simply say what I have to say. Your oath cannot make any difference to my statements.”\nAnd we are not ready to go for two years to jail for such a stupid thing. If those judges and juries and the courts are behaving stupidly, have you also to behave the same? Make them a laughingstock, make their idea of oath taking foolish.\nMy reasoning against the oath is totally different. It has nothing to do with your Quakerism. Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nMY FEAR AROUND YOUR VISION OF THE BIRTH OF THE NEW MAN THROUGH TEST-TUBES AND GENETIC ENGINEERING COMES NOT FROM THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF, BUT FROM FEAR OF WHO MIGHT CONTROL THE TECHNOLOGY. HOW CAN WE GUARANTEE THAT THIS KNOWLEDGE WILL BE USED BY CONSCIOUS HUMAN BEINGS, RATHER THAN THE IDIOT POLITICIANS WHO WOULD TURN OUR BRAVE NEW WORLD INTO ORWELL’S 1984?\nWho controls the technology today? Who controls all your nuclear weapons?\nWho controls all your scientific discoveries?\nHave you raised your voice against it? Have you even thought that the whole life on the earth is now in the hands of idiotic politicians?\nAnd it has been always so. Anything discovered is immediately captured by the governments, so why is the question only about genetic engineering? Are you not afraid that the politicians have nuclear weapons which can destroy you seven hundred times? Although destroyed once, you will not need to be destroyed again – because you are not the only begotten son of God, you will not resurrect; and messiahs are not around who will bring you back to life.\nBut you are afraid – I can understand – that if this genetic engineering is in the hands of politicians, certainly they are not going to produce the man of beauty, love, silence, intelligence, grace. They are going to create steel robots, to make all of them soldiers to fight, to kill. I know it. That’s why I have proposed there should not be nations, the world should have only one functional government. All boundaries have to be removed, all passports and green cards have to be burned. That you are a human being is enough to enter any country.\nIt is a very strange thing. You don’t ask the birds, “Where is your passport? How did you dare to enter America? – you need a visa. And if you want to remain permanently here you will need a green card.” Animals seem to be more free than you, because animals don’t know anything about the boundaries that you have drawn on your map. They go on moving from one place to another place. Sometimes they travel thousands of miles.\nThere are a few birds who live at the North Pole, but when it becomes absolutely impossible to live there because of the cold, they start moving towards warmer places. Three thousand miles they will travel – and they don’t care about your nations. In a new place... for example, they will travel and come to a warmer place, and when it it the time, there is the season of mating. So they give birth to eggs, but they don’t have enough time to take care of the eggs; three thousand miles have taken so much time.\nThey have to go back, because now the climate at the North Pole is again ready to welcome them. So they leave their eggs and fly three thousand miles again. The eggs grow on their own, the children are born. And it is something mysterious – science has not been able to figure it out: there is no guide, there is no school to teach them, there is nobody even to tell them where their parents have gone, but these newly-born birds start moving towards the North Pole three thousand miles away. Existence is really mysterious.\nNobody asks about them, when they cross the borders. Even if you ask, they will not understand your language. And even if you try to keep them out, it will be almost impossible. Man is not as free as birds, animals, fish. What a degradation!\nHence, whenever I say anything, remember the whole context of it; otherwise you will misunderstand me. I want one world, so that there is no war and no need of soldiers. I want one world government. I want the president of the world government only to be president for six months, so that he cannot do any harm. And I want one person to be chosen only once. These are all precautions.\nGenetic engineering, to give birth to children in scientific labs, will be in the hands of the scientists.\nWe have tried religion and it failed. We have tried politics and it has failed. Now we have to try science. Give it a chance, because in three hundred years it has made more progress than man has made in his whole history of millions of years.\nAnd I have proposed to you that the world should have one academy of sciences, so there is no Russian scientist, no American scientist, no Hindu scientist, no Christian scientist – all that is past. That academy will have all the geniuses of the world. And all other efforts have failed; science should be given a chance. There is no harm. At the most it can fail – the worst possibility is that science also will fail – but I don’t think it can fail.\nWe have to prepare a new kind of man. Out of that new kind of man – meditative, silent, loving – will be coming scientists.\nAnd I am not a pessimist; nor am I an optimist. I am very much a realist. As I conceive it, all these things are possible. In fact, without them life will become impossible. The choice is yours. Give science a chance, and prepare the ground so that there are no governments – only one government, which has no desire to fight because there is nobody to fight.\nEven the politician’s character will change, because there will be no political parties. People will be choosing individually, there will be no political vested interest. Because of political parties the politician is bound to be cunning, exploiting, doing all kinds of things.\nJust a few days ago they imprisoned the Reverend Moon, because all the Christians were against him – he is a Christian, he comes from Korea – and he was attracting young people. The churches were against him because they were losing their sheep. And he is a perfect businessman, he has industries in Korea; he is a great salesman. He has been selling other things, but there is no better business than selling God. You don’t have to produce, you don’t need any factory; you don’t have to do anything. All that you need is to provoke people’s fear and greed. And he was collecting enormous amounts of money.\nAll the Christian churches were against him, parents were against him. They found a small flaw; that over three years’ time he has not paid seven thousand dollars of taxes. He is jailed. He fought in many courts, but finally the Supreme Court refused to consider the case.\nThe vice president of America has not paid fifty thousand dollars in taxes – no punishment! The government simply said it was an “oversight.” Fifty thousand dollars is an oversight – seven thousand dollars, and you are in prison for eighteen months!\nIt amazes me. It is a beautiful thing to look around.… The same churches who were against Reverend Moon – in fact, these churches forced the tax department and the government: “This man should be punished. He is putting the money given to the church into his own account.” Now he is punished, and he is punished only because he is not an American. Otherwise American law provides that if a man fails to pay two thousand dollars per year he can be forgiven; he can be given a chance. There is no need to punish him, he should just give the money to the tax department.\nOver three years’ time, seven thousand dollars is not much of a crime. He should be given a chance to give the money – and he was ready to. These churches forced the government, because they wanted him to be punished, so that his congregation disperses. Now the same churches are making an appeal; they have made a protest that his case should be reconsidered.\nI have seen the whole list. All kinds of churches, Christian associations, have signed it. They are all religious organizations with one exception: it has been signed by the state of Oregon also! That is something really great. What has the state to do with it?\nThe State is fighting against us, saying that we are mixing state and religion. In fact, there is no state here, no religion here, just individuals, utterly independent, living together because they feel a certain affinity. Just because of their experiences, they find it easier to be with people who are peaceful, silent, meditative. It helps them also in return to become more meditative. I call this the Buddhafield. A certain energy is created by so many people, which can trigger anybody into going inwards.\nThe state of Oregon is in favor of Reverend Moon; it says that he should not be punished. This is not in any way the concern of the state. It means that the state does not believe the federal courts, does not believe that those courts are fair. It is a contempt of the federal courts to protest.\nAnd why with all those churches? Is the state of Oregon a church? And what authority have they got? We are also part of the state of Oregon. We have not been asked – how can they sign it on our behalf? They should have asked the whole state.\nThey did not protest when scientologists were punished, because they were not Christians. Other religious groups have been punished, forced, harassed; the state of Oregon has never signed a protest. And they are protesting because the man is a Christian – one thing.\nThe second thing: Why are all these churches protesting? These were the people who forced the government in every possible way, so that Reverend Moon should be either imprisoned or deported. They are protesting now because if Reverend Moon is a criminal by not giving seven thousand dollars to the tax department, is a criminal because he was putting the church money, corporate money, in the banks under his own name... all these churches and their bishops are doing the same!\nAfter this decision of the courts that Reverend Moon should be punished, sent to jail, they must have freaked out, because they have been doing the same thing on a larger scale. Bishops have bank accounts through which church money moves. Seeing the possibility that this may create a trouble for all the church leaders, now they are protesting on behalf of the same man they were trying to have punished. Do you see the cunningness?\nAnd only Christian churches have signed it. No Jews have signed it, no Mohammedans have signed it. And amongst those churches, the state of Oregon looks simply odd. Is it a church? And they are saying to us that we are mixing church and state! In fact, that’s what they are doing. Because they are basically Christian, they don’t want some Christian leader to be punished.\nAnd a state trying to save someone who has committed a crime is strange. The state government of Oregon seems to be a Christian state. Their hostility to us has no other base except that we don’t belong to any religion, that we have dropped all kinds of superstitions.\nI have the whole vision of the New Man: No religions, no nations, no governments – only one functional government, and a powerful world academy of scientists. And science should be the decisive factor.\nDon’t be afraid. Scientists are not monsters, scientists are very humane. And if meditation goes on flowering and sannyasins go on growing, scientists will be the first people to be interested in the inner journey. They need it; otherwise their lives are unbalanced. They are only going out, out, out. They need certain methods so they can go inwards and keep a certain balance. And a meditative scientist cannot conceive of creating monsters, murderers.\nScience has been a blessing to man. It can be a greater blessing if there is only one world.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7188","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/from_the_false_to_the_truth_467p/part31/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/from_the_false_to_the_truth_467p/>From The False To The Truth (467p)</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">31 No religions, no nations, no governments</h1><div class=post-meta>34 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7188 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/From_The_False_To_The_Truth_467p/part31.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part30>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

THE HEAD. WILL IT EVER BE POSSIBLE THAT MAN CAN FUNCTION FROM A BLEND OF
BOTH HEAD AND HEART, OR MUST THE TWO ALWAYS REMAIN TOTALLY DIVORCED?
WILL IT ALWAYS BE ESSENTIAL TO MAKE A CONSCIOUS CHOICE FOR ONE WAY OR
THE OTHER?</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing to be understood is that there is no way, either of
head or of heart. Every way leads you away, away from the truth that you
are.</p><p><br></p><p>It would have been so easy if there were a truth somewhere. Howsoever
difficult the way, people would have reached. The more difficult, the
more far away the truth was, the more challenging to the ego. If man’s
ego challenges him to reach the highest peak in the Himalayas, Everest,
where nothing is to be found; if man’s ego gives him incentive to waste
billions of dollars to reach the moon, risking lives.… But man has
reached the moon. And the first man who walked on the moon must have
looked silly to himself – there was nothing for which so much endeavor,
technology, preparation was needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, the ego wants challenges. It lives through challenge.</p><p><br></p><p>Why have so few people been able to have a glimpse of the truth? –
because it is not a challenge; it is not there, it is here within you.
It does not need any way, you are already it.</p><p><br></p><p>But the question has one other implication too: Will it ever be
possible for the head and heart to be married, or are they going to
remain forever divorced? It all depends on you, because both are
mechanisms. You are neither the head nor the heart. You can move through
the head, you can move through the heart. Of course you will reach
different places because the directions of the head and the heart are
diametrically opposite.</p><p><br></p><p>The head will go round and round thinking, brooding, philosophizing;
it knows only words, logic, argument. But it is very infertile; you
cannot get anything out of the head as far as truth is concerned,
because truth needs no logic, no argument, no philosophical research.
Truth is so simple; the head makes it so complex. Down the centuries
philosophers have been seeking and searching for the truth through the
head. None of them has found anything, but they have created great
systems of thought. I have looked into all those systems: there is no
conclusion.</p><p><br></p><p>The heart is also a mechanism – different from the head. You can call
the head the logical instrument; you can call the heart the emotional
instrument. Out of the head all the philosophies, all the theologies are
created; out of the heart, come all kinds of devotion, prayer,
sentimentality. But the heart also goes round and round in emotions.</p><p><br></p><p>The word “emotion” is good. Watch... it consists of motion, movement.
So the heart moves, but the heart is blind. It moves fast, quick,
because there is no reason to wait. It does not have to think, so it
jumps into anything. But truth is not to be found by any emotionality.
Emotion is as much a barrier as logic.</p><p><br></p><p>The logic is the male in you, and the heart is the female in you. But
truth has nothing to do with male and female. Truth is your
consciousness. You can watch the head thinking, you can watch the heart
throbbing with emotion. They can be in a certain relationship.…</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily, the society has arranged that the head should be the
master and the heart should be the servant, because society is the
creation of man’s mind, psychology, and the heart is feminine. Just as
man has kept the woman a slave, the head has kept the heart a slave.</p><p><br></p><p>We can reverse the situation: the heart can become the master, the
head can become the servant. If we have to choose between the two, if we
are forced to choose between the two, then it is better that the heart
becomes the master and the head becomes the servant.</p><p><br></p><p>There are things which the heart is incapable of. Exactly the same is
true about the head. The head cannot love, it cannot feel, it is
insensitive. The heart cannot be rational, reasonable. For the whole
past they have been in conflict. That conflict only represents the
conflict and struggle between men and women.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are talking to your wife, you must know it is impossible to
talk, it is impossible to argue, it is impossible to come to a fair
decision, because the woman functions through the heart. She jumps from
one thing to another without bothering whether there is any relationship
between the two. She cannot argue, but she can cry. She cannot be
rational, but she can scream. She cannot be cooperative in coming to a
conclusion. The heart cannot understand the language of the head.</p><p><br></p><p>The difference is not much as far as physiology is concerned, the
heart and the head are just a few inches apart from each other. But as
far as their existential qualities are concerned, they are poles
apart.</p><p><br></p><p>My way has been described as that of the heart, but it is not true.
The heart will give you all kinds of imaginings, hallucinations,
illusions, sweet dreams – but it cannot give you the truth. The truth is
behind both; it is in your consciousness, which is neither head nor
heart. Just because the consciousness is separate from both, it can use
both in harmony. The head is dangerous in certain fields, because it has
eyes but it has no legs – it is crippled.</p><p><br></p><p>The heart can function in certain dimensions. It has no eyes but it
has legs; it is blind but it can move tremendously, with great speed –
of course, not knowing where it is going. It is not just a coincidence
that in all the languages of the world love is called blind. It is not
love that is blind, it is the heart that has no eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>As your meditation becomes deeper, as your identification with the
head and the heart starts falling, you find yourself becoming a
triangle. And your reality is in the third force in you: the
consciousness. Consciousness can manage very easily, because the heart
and the head both belong to it.</p><p><br></p><p>You know the story of a blind beggar and a crippled beggar<span class=s4></span>They both lived outside the village in</p><p>the forest. Of course, they were competitors to each other, enemies –
begging is a business. But one day the forest was on fire. The cripple
had no way to escape, because he could not move on his own. He had eyes
to see which way they could get out of the fire, but what use is that if
you don’t have legs? The blind man had legs, could move fast and get out
of the fire, but how was he going to find the place where the fire had
not reached yet?</p><p><br></p><p>Both were going to die in the forest, burned alive. It was such an
emergency that they forgot their competition. In such emergencies only a
Jew can remain a businessman, and certainly those two beggars were not
Jews. In fact, to be a beggar and a Jew is a contradiction in terms.</p><p><br></p><p>They immediately dropped their antagonism – that was the only way to
survive. The blind man took the cripple on his shoulders, they found the
way out of the fire. One was seeing, and the other was moving
accordingly.</p><p><br></p><p>Something like this has to happen within you – of course, in reverse
order. The head has the eyes, the heart has the guts to move into
anything. You have to make a synthesis between the two. And the
synthesis, I have to emphasize, should be that the heart remains the
master, and the head becomes the servant.</p><p><br></p><p>You have as a servant a great asset – your reasoning. You cannot be
befooled, you cannot be cheated and exploited. The heart has all
feminine qualities: love, beauty, grace. The head is barbarous. The
heart is far more civilized, far more innocent.</p><p><br></p><p>A conscious man uses his head as a servant, and his heart as the
master – just the opposite of the story I told you.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is so simple for the man of consciousness to do. Once you
are unidentified with head or heart, and you are simply a witness of
both, you can see which qualities should be higher, which</p><p><br></p><p>qualities should be the goal. And the head as a servant can bring
those qualities, but it needs to be commanded and ordered. Right now,
and for centuries, just the opposite has been happening: the servant has
become the master. And the master is so polite, such a gentleman, that
he has not fought back, he has accepted the slavery voluntarily. The
madness on the earth is the result.</p><p><br></p><p>We have to change the very alchemy of man. We have to rearrange the
whole inside of man.</p><p>And the most basic revolution in man will come when the heart decides
the values. It cannot decide for war, it cannot go for nuclear weapons;
it cannot be death-oriented. The heart is life’s juice. Once the head is
in the service of the heart, it has to do what the heart decides. And
the head is immensely capable of doing anything, just right guidance is
needed; otherwise, it is going to go berserk, it is going to be mad. For
the head there are no values. For the head there is no meaning in
anything. For the head there is no love, no beauty, no grace – only
reasoning.</p><p><br></p><p>But this miracle is possible only by disidentifying yourself from
both. Watch the thoughts, because in your watching them, they disappear.
Then watch your emotions, sentimentalities; by your watching, they also
disappear. Then your heart is as innocent as that of a child, and your
head is as great a genius as Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell,
Aristotle.</p><p><br></p><p>But the trouble is far bigger than you can conceive. It is a
male-dominated society; man has been creating all the rules of the game,
the woman has just been following. And the conditioning has gone so
deep, because it has been going on for millions of years.</p><p><br></p><p>If in the individual the revolution happens and the heart is
re-enthroned, given its right place as the master, and the head given
the right place as a great servant, this will affect your whole social
structure. You can see it happening in my commune.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman is the master; she is not longer mistress, and the man is
no longer master. People go on asking me why, for all significant posts,
I have chosen women? For the simple reason that the woman will not
create the third world war.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been a historical fact that each war is created by the man,
but the woman suffers most. Strange – the man is the criminal and the
consequence happens to the woman! The woman loses her husband, the woman
loses her children. The woman loses her dignity, because whenever a
country is invaded, the soldiers are so much repressed – just like the
monks<span class=s4></span>Sexually they had</p><p>no opportunity while the war was going on. When the opportunity
arises – they invade a city and conquer it – their first attack is on
the woman.</p><p><br></p><p>And the war has nothing to do with the woman, she is simply outside
of the game – it is a male game, just like boxing – but she has to be
raped. Those soldiers are hankering not to be victorious for their
nation’s glory – that is a faraway thing – they are hankering to get the
women of the enemies as quickly as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>I am putting women in all significant, powerful positions. It is
symbolic. Man has a tremendous capacity to do things, but he should not
be the guide anymore. He is hung up in his head. He</p><p><br></p><p>can also become the master if he puts his heart above his head.
That’s why I said that all of my sannyasins are women – even those who
biologically, physiologically, are men. The moment they become
sannyasins they have accepted a new structure, they have put something
above their head – their heart.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what I mean: that even men around me start learning feminine
qualities. And feminine qualities are the only qualities worth
having.</p><p><br></p><p>So there is a possibility, but the possibility has a basic condition
to be fulfilled: you become more conscious, a witness, a watcher of all
that goes on inside you. The watcher becomes immediately free from
identification. Because he can see the emotions, it is an absolute
certainty that “I am not the emotions.” He can see the thoughts; the
simple conclusion is, “I am not my thought process.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Then who am I?” – a pure watcher, a witness. And you reach to the
ultimate possibility of intelligence in you: You become a conscious
man.</p><p><br></p><p>Amongst the whole world sleeping, you become awake, and once you are
awake there is no problem. Your very awakening will start shifting
things to their right places. The head has to be dethroned, and the
heart has to be crowned again. This change amongst many people will
bring a new society, a New Man in the world. It will change so many
things, you cannot conceive.</p><p><br></p><p>Science will have a totally different flavor. It will not serve death
anymore, it will not make weapons that are going to kill the whole of
life on the earth. It will make life richer, discover energies which can
make man more fulfilled, which can make man live in comfort, in luxury,
because the values will have completely changed. It will still be mind
functioning, but under the direction of the heart.</p><p><br></p><p>My way is the way of meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>I have to use language, unfortunately, that’s why I say may way is
the way of meditation: Neither of head nor of heart, but of a growing
consciousness which is above both mind and heart.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the key to open the doors for a New Man to arrive on the
earth. Question 2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>I WAS BROUGHT UP AS A QUAKER, AND WE WERE TOLD NEVER TO SWEAR ON A
BIBLE IN COURT, BECAUSE AS QUAKERS WE COULD ONLY SPEAK THE TRUTH, AND
THAT THE SOURCE OF OUR TRUTH WAS SILENCE. THIS IS SO CLOSE TO WHAT YOU
SAY, I AM SURPRISED WHEN YOU SAY YOU DON’T AGREE WITH THE THEOLOGY OF
QUAKERISM.</p><p><br></p><p>I am also surprised.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing: Quakerism is part of Christian theology. I have
never said anything against Quakerism, but you are forcing me to
now.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a by-product of Christian theology, and I am against all
theologies. Quakerism is not an independent religion, but just a sect of
Christianity. It accepts all kinds of stupidities that are propounded by
Jesus and his theologians. It is not against THE BIBLE – and THE BIBLE
is so full of rubbish, lies.</p><p><br></p><p>The basic lie is God, the holy ghost, Jesus the only begotten son of
God. Lies upon lies – a virgin birth, resurrection after being
crucified. Quakerism does not deny all these things, it accepts
them.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, you are saying you have been told not to take oath upon the
BIBLE in the court. I have also said that the oath is absolutely
unnecessary. A man who is capable of lying – no oath can prevent him.
And to take an oath placing your hand on THE BIBLE is hilarious. THE
BIBLE is so full of lies, and you are taking an oath for truth – that
you will not speak anything but truth!</p><p><br></p><p>My reason not to take an oath on any religious scripture is totally
different from that of the Quakers. The Quakers believe – remember, they
believe: I know. You have been told: I have seen.</p><p><br></p><p>And the difference is infinite between being told and experiencing it
on your own.</p><p><br></p><p>Just by being told that because you are a Quaker whatsoever you speak
will be truth.… This is strange. It is a belief, borrowed knowledge,
conditioning. Just by your being a Quaker, it is not a certainty that
whatsoever you speak will be the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, if you have experienced total silence, then nothing can come out
of you which is not true.</p><p><br></p><p>But I know many Quakers. They sit in silence also in their
congregations. I have been to their congregations, and I have asked
them, “If you are really truthful, tell me: What were you doing in your
silence?” And they have always said, “We were thinking – thinking of
silence, trying to be silent, making efforts to be silent.” Yes, it is
true they are not speaking. If you mean just by not speaking you are
silent, then you are just a fool.</p><p><br></p><p>Silence is such a deep experience, where thoughts, emotions,
everything disappears. If you have attained to that silence you will not
even call yourself a Quaker. You will not subscribe to any theology. You
don’t need one; you have found the very source of truth within
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>The Quakers have been defying the court; they will not take the oath.
They have been punished for it, because it is an insult to the court, it
is contempt of the court: they have been imprisoned, tortured. But the
Quaker and my sannyasin are totally different.</p><p><br></p><p>I say the oath is useless. But I teach my sannyasins to be
nonserious. To the Quakers it has become something of a dogmatic idea, a
fanatic standpoint: they will not take the oath. I tell my sannyasins,
“You live in a society, you have to follow their rules – remembering
that they are all man-made.”</p><p><br></p><p>For example, in some countries you have to drive on the right side of
the road, in some countries on the left side of the road. What is wrong
with the right side? You can say that it makes no difference whether you
drive on the right side or left side, it is simply a rule. Don’t Quakers
follow this simple rule? You don’t take it seriously, there is no
problem in it; it is simply a question of managing the traffic. It can
be done in both ways, so there is nothing serious about it. It is not
something like an ultimate law of existence, that if you drive on the
right side you will go to hell.</p><p><br></p><p>Quakers have been going to jail. I will not tell my sannyasins to do
that. It is not worth it. Take the oath, and say whatsoever you want to
say. Oath or no oath, it makes no difference to your statements. Why
unnecessarily enrage those poor judges and juries? Let them be
satisfied. If they are feeling happy just by your taking an oath, and
feeling that now whatever you say will be the truth, let them befool
themselves. You have to say what you want to say. The oath is irrelevant
to you, but why make so much fuss about it that you have to go for two
years behind bars?</p><p><br></p><p>I am a nonserious man. Quakers are very serious about it. They will
risk their life, but they will not take the oath. The oath has become
more important than life itself.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just a game. You play cards: there is a king and there is a
queen and there is a joker, and all sorts of people are there. You know
that this is just a playing card, and this queen is just like the queen
of England – absolutely meaningless, powerless. But while playing the
game you have to accept that this is the queen, this is the king, this
is the joker, and so on, so forth. You don’t start going to jail because
“I will not accept this card as the king!” It is up to you – don’t play
the game.</p><p><br></p><p>These are all games. That is the difference. You are asking me what
the difference is, why I criticize Quaker theology. In fact, I have
never done it before, but from now onwards I am going to do it unless
you start quaking! To take games of life seriously shows only your
stupidity, not your silence.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been in the courts. I have taken an oath, but before I take
the oath I certainly make a statement telling the judge, “I will follow
the rule, I will take the oath, but the oath cannot make any difference
to me. I will speak only that which I want to speak.</p><p><br></p><p>“And your oath, in fact, frees me from telling the truth and only the
truth, because the oath I am taking on THE BIBLE, on the GITA, on the
KORAN – which are full of lies... naturally by taking the oath on THE
BIBLE I am completely freed. Now I can lie without any trouble. Without
an oath I will only speak the truth; with an oath, there is no need
because I have already lied by putting my hand on THE BIBLE.”</p><p><br></p><p>Quakers are not against THE BIBLE – I am. In one court I refused to
put my hand on THE BIBLE. I said, “I will keep a little distance.”</p><p><br></p><p>The judge asked, “Why?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Because it is such garbage I don’t want to touch it. It is
your rule, so I will put my hand on top of it, but I will keep a little
distance. I am very allergic.” There is an immense difference between my
criticism of this system of oath taking and the Quakers’ criticism.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not saying that just because you are a sannyasin that’s enough
to guarantee that you will speak only the truth, no. Just being
sannyasins does not mean that you will only speak the truth. And it is
not so easy to decide what the truth is.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened that one of the great historians was writing the history
of the whole world. It was an immense job to write the whole history of
the whole world, of all the nations. He devoted almost fifty years,
working almost twelve, fourteen hours a day. And the day he was coming
to his last page, something happened and he burned his whole life’s
effort.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody was murdered just in the neighborhood. Of course, so many
people gathered there: the police were there, the journalists were
there. The historian also went there. He asked one person who was an
eyewitness, he asked another person who was an eyewitness – and he was
amazed. The stories of all the eyewitnesses were different. And there
was no reason for them to lie, they were not involved in it.</p><p><br></p><p>One eyewitness said he was killed inside the house. Another
eyewitness said he was killed under the sky, the open sky. The truth was
that he was killed in a house which was just being built, and the roof
was not yet there. He was killed under the open sky – without the roof
you can’t call it a house. But it was a house in the process of being
built. The roof is only a part of the house, so the other was not lying
either, saying that he was killed inside the house.</p><p><br></p><p>Listening to other eyewitnesses, he became suddenly aware of one
thing: “A murder happens in my neighborhood; within two minutes’ time I
am there, eyewitnesses are available – and it cannot be decided what
actually happened. I have been wasting my whole life writing about
Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, Nadir Shah – so much time has passed. Can I say
truthfully that what I have written is factual? Perhaps many of these
people never existed!”</p><p><br></p><p>George Gurdjieff had a theory about Jesus Christ: that he never
existed, that it is only an ancient drama which was played amongst the
Jews, there has never been a historical man Jesus. And he supported his
idea that it is only a drama, just like the dramas of Shakespeare and
Bernard Shaw. His first piece of evidence was that Jesus is not
mentioned in any Jewish book.</p><p><br></p><p>Such a man, who could walk on water, do you think he would not create
news? Would he not be mentioned somewhere in the contemporary
literature? A man who can raise the dead back to life – if he is not
mentioned, then who else will be mentioned? This man was doing all kinds
of miracles: turning stones into bread, turning water into wine<span class=s4></span>And the resurrection – he was crucified but God</p><p>would not allow his only begotten Son to be dead, so he came back
again.</p><p><br></p><p>These things make a man so significant that you cannot ignore him,
yet in no Jewish history he is even mentioned, not even in the
footnotes! George Gurdjieff has an argument there; he says it is simply
a drama. Nobody has been able to criticize George Gurdjieff; you cannot
find anything that can contradict what he is saying. So what is the
truth?</p><p><br></p><p>Take the oath; if that is the rule of the game, play it accordingly.
But make it clear that it makes no difference to you.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps it was making a difference to people in the past. And I say
to you, it will make a difference to the Quakers too, because they
believe in THE BIBLE, they believe in the biblical God, they believe in
the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The whole Christian theology is
theirs.</p><p><br></p><p>If you believe in God, you feel afraid taking the oath in the name of
God – the superstitious man will feel afraid: now it is not a question
of the court, it is now a question of God and the holy book. To lie now
will not only be a crime, it will be a sin also. Afraid of this, there
is a possibility he will say the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>For my sannyasins there is no problem. There is no God, there is no
holy book. My sannyasins can take an oath on any novel and it will be
the same. They can take an oath on anything, it makes</p><p><br></p><p>no difference at all; they will say what they want to say. The court
cannot exploit their superstitions, because they have none.</p><p><br></p><p>The oath was significant, is significant, for the so-called religious
people of the world. And that’s why a Hindu is not given THE BIBLE to
take an oath on. He is given the GITA, because THE BIBLE he can spit on
without any trouble. But the GITA? If by accident the GITA falls from
his hands, or his feet by accident touch the GITA, he is in tremendous
anguish. He has to fast, and go to the holy Ganges river to take a bath:
he has committed a great sin.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this man can be exploited. The court can manipulate this man to
tell the truth. But no court in the whole world can manipulate my
people. We don’t have any holy book, we don’t have any God to be afraid
of. Once you are free of superstitions, laughingly you can take the oath
and say whatsoever you always wanted to say – oath or no oath. So
remember, there is a difference.</p><p><br></p><p>And if the court is stubborn, don’t take it seriously. It is stupid
to suffer two years in jail just for not taking the oath. And why are
you so afraid? Are you afraid because you were going to lie, and now
after the oath you cannot lie? What is the fear?</p><p><br></p><p>You say, “I have been told that the Quaker only speaks the truth.”
You have been told – and the man who has told you was lying! Just being
a Quaker makes no difference. How can it make any difference? Yes,
Quakers sit in silence, but I know their silence is bogus, because they
don’t have the method to enter into silence. They just say, “We sit in
silence.” Yes, they are not talking, but they are thinking, they are
feeling – emotions are there.</p><p><br></p><p>Silence means you are a witness, and that word “witness” has no place
in the Quaker theology. And without being a witness you cannot be
silent; there is no other way. You will have to go through the whole
process of witnessing; only then, slowly, slowly, things will start
dropping away.</p><p><br></p><p>My people know that unless they succeed in meditation – which is
another name of witnessing – they will remain unconscious, and an
unconscious man is asleep. Can you say to a man who is just getting
ready to fall into bed and go to sleep, can you tell the man, “Please
take an oath that you will not dream about wrong things”? He may take
the oath, but he will be dreaming in the same way as he was dreaming
before.</p><p><br></p><p>The oath will not make any difference, because the oath is taken by
the conscious mind, and there are deeper layers which know nothing about
it. The unconscious mind has no idea about the oath, and the collective
unconscious mind is far deeper, and the cosmic unconscious mind is
deeper than the Pacific. They know nothing about your oath, and in sleep
they will be functioning, not your conscious mind. Your conscious mind,
which has taken the oath, will be asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Sleepy people, unconscious people, can believe in anything, but their
belief makes no difference to their inner reality.</p><p><br></p><p>So please, forget the idea that my opposition to the oath is the same
as the Quakers’ opposition to the oath. Their opposition has different
arguments for it. They say, “Because a Quaker always speaks the truth,
that’s why we will not take the oath.”</p><p><br></p><p>I say to my sannyasins, “Make the statement in the court: ’The oath
is a very ancient superstition. I will take it, if this is the game that
I have to play, but I cannot be serious about it. It does not matter –
you can give me THE BIBLE or you can give me PLAYBOY magazine, it won’t
make any difference; I will simply say what I have to say. Your oath
cannot make any difference to my statements.”</p><p><br></p><p>And we are not ready to go for two years to jail for such a stupid
thing. If those judges and juries and the courts are behaving stupidly,
have you also to behave the same? Make them a laughingstock, make their
idea of oath taking foolish.</p><p><br></p><p>My reasoning against the oath is totally different. It has nothing to
do with your Quakerism. Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>MY FEAR AROUND YOUR VISION OF THE BIRTH OF THE NEW MAN THROUGH
TEST-TUBES AND GENETIC ENGINEERING COMES NOT FROM THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF,
BUT FROM FEAR OF WHO MIGHT CONTROL THE TECHNOLOGY. HOW CAN WE GUARANTEE
THAT THIS KNOWLEDGE WILL BE USED BY CONSCIOUS HUMAN BEINGS, RATHER THAN
THE IDIOT POLITICIANS WHO WOULD TURN OUR BRAVE NEW WORLD INTO ORWELL’S
1984?</p><p><br></p><p>Who controls the technology today? Who controls all your nuclear
weapons?</p><p>Who controls all your scientific discoveries?</p><p><br></p><p>Have you raised your voice against it? Have you even thought that the
whole life on the earth is now in the hands of idiotic politicians?</p><p><br></p><p>And it has been always so. Anything discovered is immediately
captured by the governments, so why is the question only about genetic
engineering? Are you not afraid that the politicians have nuclear
weapons which can destroy you seven hundred times? Although destroyed
once, you will not need to be destroyed again – because you are not the
only begotten son of God, you will not resurrect; and messiahs are not
around who will bring you back to life.</p><p><br></p><p>But you are afraid – I can understand – that if this genetic
engineering is in the hands of politicians, certainly they are not going
to produce the man of beauty, love, silence, intelligence, grace. They
are going to create steel robots, to make all of them soldiers to fight,
to kill. I know it. That’s why I have proposed there should not be
nations, the world should have only one functional government. All
boundaries have to be removed, all passports and green cards have to be
burned. That you are a human being is enough to enter any country.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a very strange thing. You don’t ask the birds, “Where is your
passport? How did you dare to enter America? – you need a visa. And if
you want to remain permanently here you will need a green card.” Animals
seem to be more free than you, because animals don’t know anything about
the boundaries that you have drawn on your map. They go on moving from
one place to another place. Sometimes they travel thousands of
miles.</p><p><br></p><p>There are a few birds who live at the North Pole, but when it becomes
absolutely impossible to live there because of the cold, they start
moving towards warmer places. Three thousand miles they will travel –
and they don’t care about your nations. In a new place... for example,
they will travel and come to a warmer place, and when it it the time,
there is the season of mating. So they give birth to eggs, but they
don’t have enough time to take care of the eggs; three thousand miles
have taken so much time.</p><p><br></p><p>They have to go back, because now the climate at the North Pole is
again ready to welcome them. So they leave their eggs and fly three
thousand miles again. The eggs grow on their own, the children are born.
And it is something mysterious – science has not been able to figure it
out: there is no guide, there is no school to teach them, there is
nobody even to tell them where their parents have gone, but these
newly-born birds start moving towards the North Pole three thousand
miles away. Existence is really mysterious.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody asks about them, when they cross the borders. Even if you ask,
they will not understand your language. And even if you try to keep them
out, it will be almost impossible. Man is not as free as birds, animals,
fish. What a degradation!</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, whenever I say anything, remember the whole context of it;
otherwise you will misunderstand me. I want one world, so that there is
no war and no need of soldiers. I want one world government. I want the
president of the world government only to be president for six months,
so that he cannot do any harm. And I want one person to be chosen only
once. These are all precautions.</p><p><br></p><p>Genetic engineering, to give birth to children in scientific labs,
will be in the hands of the scientists.</p><p><br></p><p>We have tried religion and it failed. We have tried politics and it
has failed. Now we have to try science. Give it a chance, because in
three hundred years it has made more progress than man has made in his
whole history of millions of years.</p><p><br></p><p>And I have proposed to you that the world should have one academy of
sciences, so there is no Russian scientist, no American scientist, no
Hindu scientist, no Christian scientist – all that is past. That academy
will have all the geniuses of the world. And all other efforts have
failed; science should be given a chance. There is no harm. At the most
it can fail – the worst possibility is that science also will fail – but
I don’t think it can fail.</p><p><br></p><p>We have to prepare a new kind of man. Out of that new kind of man –
meditative, silent, loving – will be coming scientists.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am not a pessimist; nor am I an optimist. I am very much a
realist. As I conceive it, all these things are possible. In fact,
without them life will become impossible. The choice is yours. Give
science a chance, and prepare the ground so that there are no
governments – only one government, which has no desire to fight because
there is nobody to fight.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the politician’s character will change, because there will be no
political parties. People will be choosing individually, there will be
no political vested interest. Because of political parties the
politician is bound to be cunning, exploiting, doing all kinds of
things.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days ago they imprisoned the Reverend Moon, because all
the Christians were against him – he is a Christian, he comes from Korea
– and he was attracting young people. The churches were against him
because they were losing their sheep. And he is a perfect businessman,
he has industries in Korea; he is a great salesman. He has been selling
other things, but there is no better business than selling God. You
don’t have to produce, you don’t need any factory; you don’t have to do
anything. All that you need is to provoke people’s fear and greed. And
he was collecting enormous amounts of money.</p><p><br></p><p>All the Christian churches were against him, parents were against
him. They found a small flaw; that over three years’ time he has not
paid seven thousand dollars of taxes. He is jailed. He fought in many
courts, but finally the Supreme Court refused to consider the case.</p><p><br></p><p>The vice president of America has not paid fifty thousand dollars in
taxes – no punishment! The government simply said it was an “oversight.”
Fifty thousand dollars is an oversight – seven thousand dollars, and you
are in prison for eighteen months!</p><p><br></p><p>It amazes me. It is a beautiful thing to look around.… The same
churches who were against Reverend Moon – in fact, these churches forced
the tax department and the government: “This man should be punished. He
is putting the money given to the church into his own account.” Now he
is punished, and he is punished only because he is not an American.
Otherwise American law provides that if a man fails to pay two thousand
dollars per year he can be forgiven; he can be given a chance. There is
no need to punish him, he should just give the money to the tax
department.</p><p><br></p><p>Over three years’ time, seven thousand dollars is not much of a
crime. He should be given a chance to give the money – and he was ready
to. These churches forced the government, because they wanted him to be
punished, so that his congregation disperses. Now the same churches are
making an appeal; they have made a protest that his case should be
reconsidered.</p><p><br></p><p>I have seen the whole list. All kinds of churches, Christian
associations, have signed it. They are all religious organizations with
one exception: it has been signed by the state of Oregon also! That is
something really great. What has the state to do with it?</p><p><br></p><p>The State is fighting against us, saying that we are mixing state and
religion. In fact, there is no state here, no religion here, just
individuals, utterly independent, living together because they feel a
certain affinity. Just because of their experiences, they find it easier
to be with people who are peaceful, silent, meditative. It helps them
also in return to become more meditative. I call this the Buddhafield. A
certain energy is created by so many people, which can trigger anybody
into going inwards.</p><p><br></p><p>The state of Oregon is in favor of Reverend Moon; it says that he
should not be punished. This is not in any way the concern of the state.
It means that the state does not believe the federal courts, does not
believe that those courts are fair. It is a contempt of the federal
courts to protest.</p><p><br></p><p>And why with all those churches? Is the state of Oregon a church? And
what authority have they got? We are also part of the state of Oregon.
We have not been asked – how can they sign it on our behalf? They should
have asked the whole state.</p><p><br></p><p>They did not protest when scientologists were punished, because they
were not Christians. Other religious groups have been punished, forced,
harassed; the state of Oregon has never signed a protest. And they are
protesting because the man is a Christian – one thing.</p><p><br></p><p>The second thing: Why are all these churches protesting? These were
the people who forced the government in every possible way, so that
Reverend Moon should be either imprisoned or deported. They are
protesting now because if Reverend Moon is a criminal by not giving
seven thousand dollars to the tax department, is a criminal because he
was putting the church money, corporate money, in the banks under his
own name... all these churches and their bishops are doing the same!</p><p><br></p><p>After this decision of the courts that Reverend Moon should be
punished, sent to jail, they must have freaked out, because they have
been doing the same thing on a larger scale. Bishops have bank accounts
through which church money moves. Seeing the possibility that this may
create a trouble for all the church leaders, now they are protesting on
behalf of the same man they were trying to have punished. Do you see the
cunningness?</p><p><br></p><p>And only Christian churches have signed it. No Jews have signed it,
no Mohammedans have signed it. And amongst those churches, the state of
Oregon looks simply odd. Is it a church? And they are saying to us that
we are mixing church and state! In fact, that’s what they are doing.
Because they are basically Christian, they don’t want some Christian
leader to be punished.</p><p><br></p><p>And a state trying to save someone who has committed a crime is
strange. The state government of Oregon seems to be a Christian state.
Their hostility to us has no other base except that we don’t belong to
any religion, that we have dropped all kinds of superstitions.</p><p><br></p><p>I have the whole vision of the New Man: No religions, no nations, no
governments – only one functional government, and a powerful world
academy of scientists. And science should be the decisive factor.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be afraid. Scientists are not monsters, scientists are very
humane. And if meditation goes on flowering and sannyasins go on
growing, scientists will be the first people to be interested in the
inner journey. They need it; otherwise their lives are unbalanced. They
are only going out, out, out. They need certain methods so they can go
inwards and keep a certain balance. And a meditative scientist cannot
conceive of creating monsters, murderers.</p><p><br></p><p>Science has been a blessing to man. It can be a greater blessing if
there is only one world.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part30>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

‌CHAPTER 1
Dropping out of the wheel
1 March 1975 am in Buddha Hall
ALSO, MEDITATE ON KNOWLEDGE THAT COMES DURING SLEEP. ALSO, MEDITATE ON ANYTHING THAT APPEALS TO YOU.
THUS, THE YOGI BECOMES MASTER OF ALL, FROM THE INFINITESIMAL TO THE INFINITE.
MAN SLEEPS almost one-third of his life, twenty years approximately. But sleep has been neglected, terribly neglected. Nobody thinks about it, nobody meditates on it.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
The consistency of being
10 March 1975 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
WHAT HAPPENED TO RAJNEESH ON MARCH 21ST? DID HE ATTAIN SAMADHI WITH OR WITHOUT SEED?
THIS IS NOT ONLY your question, this is mine also! Ever since, I have also been wondering what happened to this guy Rajneesh. On that night, one moment he was there, and next moment he was not there.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Ego’s attraction
2 March 1975 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
I FEEL A CONFLICT BETWEEN BEING LOOSE AND NATURAL AND BEING AWARE.
THERE IS NO conflict, but you can create a conflict. Even where no conflict exists the mind creates the conflict, because the mind cannot exist without being in conflict.
Being loose and natural will give you a spontaneous awareness.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
Periphery and center
3 March 1975 am in Buddha Hall
WHEN THE ACTIVITY OF THE MIND IS UNDER CONTROL, THE MIND BECOMES LIKE PURE CRYSTAL, REFLECTING EQUALLY, WITHOUT DISTORTION, THE PERCEIVER, THE PERCEPTION AND THE PERCEIVED.
SAVITARKA SAMADHI IS THE SAMADHI IN WHICH THE YOGI IS STILL UNABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE REAL KNOWLEDGE, KNOWLEDGE BASED ON WORDS AND KNOWLEDGE BASED ON REASONING OR SENSE PERCEPTIONS, WHICH ALL REMAIN IN THE MIND IN A MIXED STATE.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
The un-minding of being
4 March 1975 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
YOU SAID THAT NATURE ABHORS DISORDER, AND DISORDER SETTLES ITSELF AUTOMATICALLY IN DUE TIME.
THEN WHY HAS THE WORLD ALWAYS BEEN IN CHAOS AND DISORDER?
THE WORLD has never been in chaos and disorder, only the mind. The world is absolutely orderly. It is not a chaos, it is a cosmos.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
The pure look
5 March 1975 am in Buddha Hall
NIRVITARKA SAMADHI IS ATTAINED WHEN THE MEMORY IS PURIFIED, AND THE MIND IS ABLE TO SEE THE TRUE NATURE OF THINGS WITHOUT OBSTRUCTION.
THE EXPLANATIONS GIVEN FOR THE SAMADHIS OF SAVITARKA AND NIRVITARKA, ALSO EXPLAIN THE HIGHER STATES OF SAMADHI, BUT IN THESE HIGHER STATES OF SAVICHARA AND NIRVICHARA SAMADHIS, THE OBJECTS OF MEDITATION ARE MORE SUBTLE</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
Mind in a hurry
6 March 1975 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
WHEN YOU SPEAK ON PATANJALI, I FEEL THAT HE IS THE PATH FOR ME. WHEN YOU SPEAK ON ZEN, THEN ZEN IS THE PATH FOR ME. WHEN YOU SPEAK ON TANTRA, THEN IT IS TANTRA FOR ME. HOW DO I KNOW WHICH IS THE PATH FOR ME?</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
The thought of no-thought
7 March 1975 am in Buddha Hall
THESE SAMADHIS THAT RESULT FROM MEDITATION ON AN OBJECT ARE SAMADHIS WITH SEED, AND DO NOT GIVE FREEDOM FROM THE CYCLE OF REBIRTH.
ON ATTAINING THE UTMOST PURITY OF THE NIRVICHARA STAGE OF SAMADHI, THERE IS A DAWNING OF THE SPIRITUAL LIGHT.
IN NIRVICHARA SAMADHI, THE CONSCIOUSNESS IS FILLED WITH TRUTH.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
The Master appears
8 March 1975 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
HOW IS IT THAT AN ENLIGHTENED PERSON LIKE KRISHNAMURTI CANNOT SEE THAT HE IS NOT HELPING PEOPLE? IF HE IS ENLIGHTENED SHOULD NOT HE BE ABLE TO SEE ALL? AND YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO HELP ALL TYPES BUT YOU ALSO SAY THAT YOU ARE CONTRADICTORY ON PURPOSE, SO THAT SOME PEOPLE WILL GO AWAY.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
The fall of the idiots
9 March 1975 am in Buddha Hall
IN THE STATE OF NIRVICHARA SAMADHI, AN OBJECT IS EXPERIENCED IN ITS FULL PERSPECTIVE, BECAUSE IN THIS STATE KNOWLEDGE IS GAINED DIRECT, WITHOUT THE USE OF THE SENSES.
THE PERCEPTION GAINED IN NIRVICHARA SAMADHI TRANSCENDS ALL NORMAL PERCEPTIONS BOTH IN EXTENT AND INTENSITY.
WHEN THIS CONTROLLING OF ALL OTHER CONTROLS IS TRANSCENDED, THE SEEDLESS SAMADHI IS ATTAINED, AND WITH IT, FREEDOM FROM LIFE AND DEATH.</description>

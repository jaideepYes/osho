AT THE SAME TIME, YOU SAY THAT ENLIGHTENMENT IS NEITHER LOVE NOR HATE. ARE YOU SPEAKING OF TWO DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF LOVE? HOW DOES THIS FIT WITH YOUR MESSAGE OF LOVE?\nLOVE and hate are just two sides of the same coin. But with love something very drastic has happened. It is unimaginable how this drastic step was taken by people who had all the good intentions in the world. You may never have even suspected what has destroyed love. It is the continuous teaching of love that has destroyed it. Hate is still pure – love is not.\nWhen you hate, your hate has an authenticity. And when you love it is only hypocrisy.\nThis has to be understood. For thousands of years all the religions, politicians, pedagogues, have been teaching one thing, and that one thing is love: Love your enemy, love your neighbor, love your parents, love God.\nWhy in the beginning did they start this strange series of teachings about love? They were afraid of your authentic love, because authentic love is beyond their control. You are possessed by it. You are not the possessor, you are the possessed. And every society wants you to be in control.\nThe society is afraid of your wild nature, it is afraid of your naturalness, so from the very beginning it starts cutting your wings. And the most basic thing which is dangerous in you is the possibility of love, because if you are possessed by love you can go even against the whole world.\nA small man possessed by love feels himself capable of doing the impossible. In all old love stories this fact has emerged in a very subtle way; and nobody has even bothered about it or even commented on why this factor comes automatically into old love stories.\nFor example, in the East we have the most famous love stories of Majnu and Laila. That is a Sufi story. It doesn’t matter whether it is historical or not, that is not our concern. Our concern is its structure, which is almost the same structure as all the love stories around the world. The second famous Eastern love story is about Siri and Farhad – but the structure is the same. The third famous story is about Soni and Mahival, but the structure remains the same.\nThe structure is that the lover is asked to do something impossible; if he can do that impossible thing then he can get the beloved. Of course the parents and the society are not ready to accept this love affair. No society is ready to accept any love affair, but to say no seems to be unmannerly.\nWhen somebody comes with a proposal of love you can’t just say no. Even if you want to say no, and you will say no, a way has to be found – and this is the way. Ask the lover to perform something impossible, something which you know he cannot perform, which is an inhuman task. And if he cannot perform it then you are not responsible; he himself has failed.\nThis is a civilized way of saying no. Farhad is told that he can have Siri if, alone, he can create a canal through the mountains and bring the canal to the palace of the king – Siri is the daughter of the king. And the canal has to be of milk, not of water.\nNow, this is absurd. In the first place, even if it was just going to be a water canal, a young man, single-handed... and from the mountains, hundreds of miles away, it will take thousands of years for him to bring the canal to the palace. Even if it is accepted, hypothetically, that it may be possible, how can he manage a canal of milk? From where will that much milk go on continuously flowing through the canal? And the king wants his palace gardens to be watered with milk – only then will Farhad be qualified to ask for the hand of the king’s daughter.\nI have been thinking about hundreds of love stories around the world, but somehow or other this factor constantly appears: something impossible is asked. My own understanding is that that factor does not appear without any reason. There is somewhere in the unconscious of the human mind the knowledge that love can make the impossible possible.\nLove is so mad. Once you are possessed with love you don’t think in terms of reason and logic, reality. You live in a world of dreams where everything is within your hands. My only concern with these love stories has been to find out something about love which is very essential, and this is what I have found about it: Love makes you so mad that nothing is impossible.\nWhen Farhad is asked to do this job of making a canal from the mountains thousands of miles away, he starts. He does not even say, “Are you mad? What are you asking? You are making it impossible from the very beginning. Why don’t you simply say no? Why go so roundabout?” No, he does not say a single word; he simply takes a spade and moves towards the mountains.\nThe people in the court of the king ask the king, “What have you done? You know perfectly well this is not possible. You cannot do it, we cannot do it – nobody can do it. You with all your army, with all your forces, cannot bring this canal to the palace – and bringing milk from where? Milk does not come out of streams in the mountains. You can conquer the whole world – we know your power and we know your armies – but that’s another matter. You cannot change the ways of nature.\n“In the first place, that poor boy alone – you have told him he is not to ask any help from anybody – is going to dig the canal from the mountains to your palace. It will take millions of years for him, and even if he manages to do it, from where is the milk going to come in the canal?”\nThe king says, “I know all about it – it is not going to happen. That’s why I have asked, that’s how I have thrown the whole responsibility on him. Now, if he cannot do it, he is responsible. I am saved from saying no to anybody.”\nBut the people in the court are more puzzled about the young man, Farhad. They rush out, catch hold of him and ask him, “Are you mad or something? Where are you going? It is not possible.”\nFarhad says, “Everything is possible. Just my love has to be authentic, to be true.”\nExistence cannot deny love. Existence may change its nature, its laws, but it cannot deny love because love is the highest law of nature. For the higher law, lower laws can be erased, changed.\nThose wise counsellors of the king are shocked by the answer, but the answer seems to be significant. What the mad young man is saying makes sense. The story is that Farhad succeeded. Alone he managed to create the canal, and just because of his authenticity, his truthfulness, his trust in existence, the water turned into milk.\nThis is just a story; I don’t think existence or nature is going to change its laws. But one thing is certain: society became aware very early that love is mad. And once a man is possessed of love then he is beyond your control, then you cannot convince him of anything. Then no reason is applicable, no logic makes any sense to him; his love is the ultimate law. Everything else has to submit to it.\nI am not saying that it does submit, I am not saying that nature is going to change its ways, I am not saying that love will make miracles possible. No, what I am saying is about this fear that love can make a man so mad that he can start believing in things like this; then he is beyond your control.\nTo keep man in control you have to, from a very early age, create a false idea of love in him, and go on enforcing it continuously so he never becomes possessed by authentic love and never goes mad, but always remains sane. Sane means a slave to the rules of the society, sane means a follower of the games of the society.\nLove can make you rebellious. False love makes you obedient.\nThat’s why they teach you to love God. Now, telling a small child to love God is such utter nonsense. The child does not know who God is, and without knowing the object how do you expect him to love\nGod? But you pray to God with folded hands toward the sky, and the child starts imitating you. God is there, above, in heaven – still – although now everybody knows that the earth is round.\nWhat is above to us is not above in India; it is below them, we are below them. The sky that is above us is not above them. But people around the earth are looking towards the sky and the God that lives there above, in heaven.\nNow, knowing the fact that the earth is round – heaven is everywhere above. And different corners of heaven are above different people; and that too is not fixed because the earth is moving on its axis continuously, so what was above you a few minutes before is no longer above you. What was above a few hours before is no longer above you; it may be below you.\nYour God will have to perform a real circus act to fulfill your desire that He remain above you. You have given Him such a task that even if you give Him omnipotence he cannot manage it. It is simply not possible.\nBut the small child simply starts imitating; whatever the parents are doing, the child will start doing it. They go to the church – he goes to the church. They go to the synagogue – he goes to the synagogue. This is nurture against nature. And a man who can love God is a man who will never know what love is.\nJust think: a man who can love God without even knowing who this guy is, where He is, whether He is or not, and if He is whether He is worth loving – is He at all interested in you and in your love? A man, without knowing any of these things, loves God, loves Jesus Christ, not knowing whether this man was ever an historical person or not. If Christians’ stories about Christ are true then Christ cannot be historical. This is a paradox.\nIf their stories about Jesus are true then Jesus cannot be true. Jesus can be true only on one condition: if the stories told by Christians about him are proved to be untrue. Now this is a difficult problem, because if all the stories told about him by the Christians are proved untrue, Christians will not be interested in such a Christ. They were interested only because of those stories that you have proved untrue.\nJesus has meant nothing to them except those stories: the virgin birth, his walking on water, his turning water into wine, his changing stones into bread; his curing of blind people, crippled people, paralyzed people; his raising of the dead to life. All these stories are the basis for a Christian to have faith.\nI am saying, if all these stories are true then Jesus is a mythological figure. He cannot be an historical fact because real men don’t walk on water. There is no way to change water into wine, there is no way to change stones into bread.\nIn Jesus’ life itself you will find enough evidence that these things cannot be true, because there are days when he and his disciples were hungry and had to sleep with empty stomachs because the villagers they had passed were very against him. They would not give him shelter, they would not give him bread. But if this man was able to change stones into bread, what was the problem?\nIn fact he could have changed the whole status of humanity, and there would have been no need for Jews to crucify him, if he had provided the whole of humanity with food. And there are enough stones in the world – mountains! He could have changed the Himalayas into a big loaf, so Indians could go on eating for centuries and centuries. He could have changed oceans into wine so there would be no need to worry about it; even poor people could afford the best wine, the oldest wine, the finest wine.\nIf he was capable of raising the dead then rather than raising Lazarus – who was of no use at all... I don’t see that raising Lazarus was of any value. He should have chosen Moses, Abraham, Ezekiel – then Jews would have worshipped him rather than crucifying him. If he had raised all the old prophets, the Jews would have, without any question, accepted him as the only begotten son of God. What would have been the need to argue? – he could have proved himself by action.\nBut those stories are just stories. Jesus, to be historical, has to be denuded of all those miracles. But once you drop all those miracles Christians are no longer interested in Jesus. What is left in him? Why should they believe in him?\nThey really never believed in him. That’s why I say that my religion is the first and the last religion on the earth, because you are here with me not for any miracle that I have performed. You are here with me not because of anything that is special about me.\nI don’t carry any authority from God, I don’t have any support from the scriptures. I am just as ordinary as you are.\nUp to now this has never happened. People love Jesus because of his miracles; take the miracles away and their love disappears. They were attracted by the magical qualities, they were not concerned with Jesus at all. They were interested in Krishna because he was the incarnation of God and performed so many miracles. Just take those miracles away, and Krishna is finished!\nYou cannot finish me. You can take anything away from me but you cannot finish me, because I have not in any way tried to influence you, impress you, by something which is superhuman. Everything can be taken away from me, but your relationship towards me will remain the same; it can’t be changed, because in the first place it is a simple relationship.\nThose relationships between Christians and Christ, and Jews and Moses, and Hindus and Krishna, are not at all concerned with the individual. If Jesus meets you on the way and tells you, “I am Jesus Christ,” the first thing you will ask him is to walk on water.\nYou cannot ask me that. You cannot even ask me to walk, because I have never done even that miracle! Walking on water... you cannot ask me because you will look foolish. But with Jesus, you can ask him and you will be perfectly right. If he simply drowns in water then he is going to drown. It is just against physical laws: he is going to drown.\nThen what will be your relationship with a Jesus who drowns... you have to run and jump and save him and give him artificial breathing. What will be your relationship with this man? Just think of it. No, you don’t have any relationship with Jesus, Mahavira, Buddha, Krishna, not at all. Your attention is diverted.\nThey teach you to love Jesus. Why? Because he turned water into wine? Even if he turned water into wine, that does not mean he deserves your love. In fact he has committed a crime, he should be behind bars. Turning water into wine without a license... you are going against the law, against the government, against society. He should be punished – i don’t see how he can deserve your love. And it is an old story – today he would turn any vegetable into marijuana, hash.\nPresident Ronald Reagan goes on quoting Jesus, not knowing about the man, that if he was here and if he was to do any miracle – and he would have to do a miracle because without that miracle he is nobody – then he would be the biggest dope dealer in America. That would be the only miracle that America would understand. He would not turn stones into bread – there is enough bread in America – he would turn stones into L.S.D.\nNo, he never did any of these things. But then your love and your faith disappear. From the very childhood you have been told to love God, whom you know not; you are not even certain that He exists. Your love has been diverted in a direction which is absolutely imaginary, it has no corresponding reality to it.\nYour love for Jesus is not for Jesus but for things which any mediocre mind feels impressed with. If you have a little bit of intelligence you can see that all that is nonsense.\nBut from the very childhood they are diverting your love into unreal dimensions. One thing which is a very cunning strategy is to give your love a mode, a certain direction, which is unfulfillable; and because of it, that which was fulfillable will not be attractive to you.\nA man who has been taught to love God will feel that in loving a woman or a man he is falling too low. God is there, far above, in the heaven – and this is an ordinary man, an ordinary woman.\nThey have given your love an object so impossible that all that is possible becomes below you. Even if, because of your nature, your biology, you fall in love, there is a part in you which goes on saying, “Something is wrong in it,” you go on feeling guilty. This is one thing they have done to your love.\nThe second thing they have done is to say, “Love your mother.…” Why? – “because she is your mother.” Is that enough for love to exist? Do you have to love somebody because that somebody is your mother, your father, your daughter, your brother, your sister? These relationships cannot create love. They may create a certain kind of respect – she is your mother and you can respect her. He is your father, you can respect him; he has brought you up. But love is not something that you can manage.\nRespect is something within your hands, but love is not.\nLove is something that when it comes it comes like a cyclone, surrounds you, holds you totally in its grip.\nYou are no longer there.\nSomething higher than you, bigger than you, deeper than you, has taken possession of you.\nTo avoid this they have been teaching you hypocrisy in the name of love: Love your mother. Just because of this teaching – love your father, love your mother, love your brother, love your wife, love your husband, love your children – because it has been told so many times you have never asked, “Is it possible? Is it within human capacity to love somebody?” A very fundamental question has been completely forgotten.\nIf you are told to love somebody, how are you going to do it? Yes, you can act, you can pretend, you can repeat beautiful dialogues from the movies you have been seeing, from the novels you have been reading. You say beautiful things, but nothing is arising from you. You are not in love, you are just doing a drama. And the tragedy is that most of us continue our whole lives doing the rehearsal, not even the drama. The time for the drama never comes just the rehearsal goes on and on.\nAnd even if for a few people the time of drama comes, that drama is also as unreal as anything can be, because your heart is not in it. It is dead, it does not breathe. It has no warmth, no liveliness, no dance. You are doing it because you have been trained to do it. It is a kind of exercise, a gymnastics, an etiquette, a mannerism – anything – but not love.\nThese are the ways they have spoiled your authenticity about love.\nYour question is, that I say love and hate are the same energy; then why is there so much hate in the world and not so much love?\nIt is because nobody has been teaching you about hate; hence, hate has remained pure, unadulterated. Nobody has bothered about you, nobody has told you how to hate, whom to hate. Because hate has been left untouched by your parents, teachers, and priests, it has a purity, a sincerity.\nWhen a man hates you, you can trust that he hates you. But when he loves you, you cannot trust him.\nYou know perfectly well that when you hate someone it has a tremendous force, and when you love someone there is not that force. You remember your enemies more than your friends. You can forget your friends but you cannot forget your enemies.\nWhat is happening?\nIt is because your love has been distorted, and something unreal, which is not love, has been handed to you. And you have been playing with that toy called love, unaware that you have a potential of love within you.\nSo when you love it is just so-so, skin-deep. Scratch it a little bit and it is gone. But when you hate, you hate from your guts. It is not skin-deep – it is gut-deep.\nI have been surprised how much purity your hate has, how much authenticity, naturalness, spontaneity. And just because of its spontaneity, naturalness, authenticity, purity, I see in it a certain beauty which is not there in your love. Your love is hocus-pocus.\nThis is the reason why in the world you don’t see so much love and you see so much hate.\nYou listen to too much talk about love in the world. Everybody is loving everybody else, talking about love, but it is all talk: yakketty-yakketty-yak! It goes on all over the world. Everybody is talking about love – beautiful dialogues – but in fact you see hate everywhere.\nReligions hate each other. Nations hate each other. Political parties hate each other. Classes hate each other. Just go on looking and you will be surprised how many sources of hate there are.\nAnd every ten years, twelve years, you need a world war – so much hate and still it gets accumulated. Every day you go on expressing hate that’s separate – still it goes on accumulating so much that every ten, twenty years, it explodes into a world war.\nIn three thousand years, five thousand wars have been fought in the world. Who is responsible? – the good-doers who are continuously after you, teaching you about love, kindness, compassion. Nobody teaches you about hate, so it is still there, far more strong, far more vibrant and young and fresh.\nI would like a time to come when nobody teaches you about love either. You should be left alone. You should be told to be more aware about whatsoever happens to you – hate or love, that is not important.\nWhat is important is that if you hate, hate with awareness. If you love, love with awareness.\nIf I was going to teach you I would not tell you whom to love, how to love. That is all nonsense. Love is your intrinsic quality. You are born with it, just as hate is also there. I will teach you, be aware.\nBefore anything happens to you – love or hate, anger, passion, compassion, anything – be aware. Let everything arise out of your awareness.\nAnd the miracle of awareness is that without your saying anything, without your doing anything, it simply dissolves all that is ugly in you into all that is beautiful.\nAwareness is a transforming force.\nFor example, if you are aware of anger, it will disappear. If you are aware of love it will become stronger. If there is hate and you become aware of it, it will disappear, dissipate. Soon you will find that that cloud of hatred has disappeared and instead a totally opposite quality – a mixture of compassion, kindness, lovingness – has been left behind like an aroma.\nTo me this is the criterion:\nWhatsoever deepens with your awareness is virtue. Whatsoever disappears with your awareness is sin. To me this is the definition.\nI don’t label any act as sin, virtue, right, wrong – acts don’t have that quality. It is your awareness.\nJust try it and you will be simply amazed that there are things in you which cannot stand in front of awareness, they simply disappear.\nAwareness functions almost like magic.\nAnd what I am saying you can experiment with. I am not telling you to believe in it, because belief will not help. You will have to experiment with it. You will have to see, with the different things in you, what remains and what disappears.\nAnd it is only you who can find what is right for you and what is wrong for you. Then keep the thread of awareness running through all your actions, and in your life you will not find any hate, any anger, any jealousy. Not that you have dropped them, not that you have repressed them, not that you have somehow got rid of them, not that you have practiced doing something against them. No, you have not done anything, you have not even touched them.\nThis is the beauty of awareness: it never represses anything; but there are things which simply melt in the light of awareness and change. And there are things which become more solid, more integrated, more profound, more strong: love, compassion, kindness, friendliness, understanding.\nAll the religions up to date have been focusing people’s minds on actions; and labeling – this is bad, this is good, this you have to do, this you have not to do.\nI want to change the whole emphasis.\nActions have nothing to do with right and wrong.\nIt is you, your alertness, which is decisive. Any action with awareness may become beautiful; the same action without awareness may be ugly. With your awareness, the same action in one situation may disappear, and in another situation may become solid, stronger.\nSo it is not something like a fixed quality of any act, of any emotion; it all depends on a thousand and one things. But your awareness takes note of everything, you need not be worried. It is just like light in which everything becomes clear to you, you can see it.\nOne Zen monk, throughout his whole life, was imprisoned again and again. He was a great Master with thousands of disciples. Even the magistrates loved him, respected him. And they prayed of him, “Why do you do such strange things? We can’t understand, it is beyond our comprehension” – because he was stealing small things from his own disciples, and naturally the law had to take its course.\nThe magistrates would say, “We know there is something else in it. Why should you steal one shoe of somebody’s? – it is useless, you cannot use it. And now we have to send you for two months into jail.” The Zen Master was always very happy when he heard, and he used to say to the magistrates, “Can’t you send me for a little longer? – because anyway, when I come out I will do it again, and you will have to send me in again. Why can’t you send me for a longer period and save me from doing all these things?”\nOnly in the end, when he was dying, did his disciples ask, “Now let us at least ask, because we will never again have a chance to know what was the reason you were stealing things, things which mattered not at all to you. We were always ready to bring anything you wanted, but you never said anything, you never asked for anything.”\nHe laughed. He said, “The real reason was I wanted to be as long as possible in the jail because there are three thousand people in the jail, and I have found in those three thousand people more innocent, more natural human beings than I find outside the jail. And outside the jail there are many masters and many religions, and they are doing their work. Nobody takes care of those poor people. When I am in the jail I teach them meditation, I teach them how to be aware – the jail has become a monastery!\n“We have changed it completely. All the prisoners are meditating. The jailer cannot detect it because they are simply doing everything with awareness. They are continuing to do the same work as before: if cutting wood, then cutting wood; if cutting rocks, then cutting rocks; if making roads, then making roads. Whatever they were doing before they are doing now, but with a great difference.\n“And the best monastery I know right now,” he said, “is the jail where I have been going continually, because this jail has people who are sentenced for life – twenty years, thirty years. Now, this is a great opportunity: for thirty years they can meditate without any disturbance from the outside world. Where else could I find such people?\n“And I am immensely happy because I am leaving behind me, in that jail, a thread which will continue for centuries. This jail will remain a totally different jail. Whoever comes there is bound to get involved in meditation because some old-timers will always be there.”\nNow, looking at it from the outside, a man stealing is doing something wrong, and a man continually going to jail, being sentenced again and again, is certainly a criminal. But if you look at that man’s consciousness and the act out of that consciousness, it is totally different.\nNever judge anybody by his act, because the real thing is not the act but the consciousness through which that act has been performed. But we all judge by acts because acts are available outside like objects. Consciousness we don’t know.\nIt happened in a Zen monastery... there were two wings, a left wing and a right wing – the monastery was just made in that way. Five hundred monks lived in one wing, five hundred in the other wing, and the Master’s house was just in the middle of both.\nThe Master had a cat, a very beautiful cat, and all the disciples were very loving towards the cat. But once in a while there was a quarrel because the left wingers wanted the cat – they were having some party, some fun – but the right wingers were not willing to allow them the cat at that time. The cat became a constant object of quarrels, fights.…\nOne day the Master called all the disciples and asked them to bring the cat. He told them, “You both love the cat, but the cat is only one.” So he cut the cat in two – it was a shock to all the disciples – and told them, “Now you can have half, and you can have half. Now no more quarreling in this monastery.”\nThere was silence. They could not understand that such a non-violent person could cut the cat in two. They all wondered and worried and thought about it. The story reached the king, who was also a disciple of the Master. He could not contain his curiosity; he came the next day. He asked, “I have heard that you have killed your most loved cat.”\nThe Master said, “I have not killed the cat, I have killed a conflict, a quarrel which was growing every day and was growing out of proportion. And these fools won’t understand unless I take a drastic step. I have not killed the cat, because nobody dies. The cat is freed from this body because of these fools. And anyway she was going to die; she had already lived long enough – perhaps she would have lived one year or two more years at the most.\n“So before killing her I became totally silent, aware, and asked myself, ‘What is this poor cat going to do in those two years? Nothing. But in two years these fools will do much.’\n“I have not killed the cat out of anger, I have not killed the cat out of hate. I loved her and I love her more now because she helped to solve a problem. And it was a good shock to these idiots, because without shocks their minds don’t function. Once in a while you have to hit them.”\nAnd certainly it happened from that day all kinds of quarreling simply disappeared, because those disciples became aware that this man is dangerous, he can kill somebody; the quarrel can be too hazardous. All arguments ceased.\nAnd the king was absolutely satisfied. He said, “This has always been your teaching, that it is not the act but the consciousness. We can only see the act; we don’t know in what consciousness you did it. That is only known to you. Who are we to decide about it?”\nNever judge anybody by the act.\nWait. Try to find out his awareness – otherwise don’t judge at all. It is safer not to judge. And about yourself, remember, whatsoever you are doing, keep only one thing in mind, that you are doing it with full awareness.\nThen I allow you total freedom.\nNo religion has allowed you freedom. I allow you total freedom.\nNo religion has given you responsibility unto yourself, no religion has given you the right to decide what is right, what is wrong. I give you the right, the responsibility, because to me everything arises out of a single source – and that is awareness.\nThe question says that I have talked about love, my message is about love, and I also have said that the man of enlightenment has neither love nor hate. Now, rather than asking me, you are mature enough to work out simple things. It is so simple: when through awareness the whole hate energy turns into love, it is totally a new phenomenon – it needs a new name. But what to do? Languages are poor so we have to use the same words, giving them different meanings, definitions.\nMy message of love is not the message of that love which is the polar opposite of hate. My message of love is of that love which is capable of absorbing hate and transforming it.\nNow, the question arises that if there is no more hate, how and why should this new energy be called love?\nLove, in our minds, is something against hate. Now, there is no opposite to love. That’s why, once in a while, I have been reminding you that the man of enlightenment has neither hate nor love – that is to deny your hate and your love. Love and hate as polarities, he has none. That does not mean that he is indifferent, although that’s how it will appear to you. That’s why I speak of the poverty of language.\nIf the man of enlightenment has no love, no hate, that means he will be indifferent, neutral – no, that is not the meaning.\nHe has a new kind, a new quality of love which is not opposed to hate. Now, there is no word for it; so either I have to say he has no hate, no love the way you have, or I have to say that his love is a totally new kind of love; a love which is closer to compassion than to passion, which is closer to a relatedness than to a relationship; a love which is more a giving without asking anything in return than your so-called love. which is a bargain – where each party is trying to get more and give less.\nThe enlightened man simply gives.\nIt is not that he wants to get something from you – you don’t have anything to give to him. What do you have to give him?\nHe gives because he has too much to give, he is overburdened.\nHe gives because he is like a raincloud, so full of rain that it has to shower. It does not matter where, on whom – on rocks, on good soil, on gardens, in the ocean... it doesn’t matter at all. The cloud simply wants to unburden itself.\nThe enlightened man is just like a raincloud.\nHe gives you love, not to get anything back. He shares it and is obliged to you that you allowed him the opportunity; that you were open enough, available, vulnerable; that you did not reject when he was ready to pour all his blessings on you; that you opened your heart and received as much as was within your capacity.\nThe world can be full of love, the love I am talking about. And only that love will transform the hatred in the world – not the love that has been taught to you. That has not made the world more loving, it has made the world more hateful: made its hate truer and more authentic and its love more of a hypocrisy.\nI would like a world full of love. But remember, that love has no opposite to it. It is simply because you inside yourself have been able, through awareness, to transform your hate into love. Even to\nsay that you have been able to transform it is not right, but what else to do with language? Whatever you say, something is wrong in saying it, something goes wrong in saying it.\nThe fact is, awareness itself transforms your hate into love, not that you transform it. Your work and function is simply to remain aware. Don’t let anything happen in your life without awareness.\nI am giving you the simplest and the most natural religion possible. That’s why I say it is the first and the last, because it cannot be simplified more. There is nothing more below awareness; we have come to the very last root. There is no way to go beyond it, further than it. This is it!\nJust go on doing all the things that you are doing, but keep aware. Make it a constant remembrance that no act passes in unconsciousness.\nIt will take a little time. Every day you will miss many things; later on you will remember, “My God! I forgot again.” But there is nothing to be worried about. Don’t get worried about it, otherwise you are going to miss something else. That which is gone is gone – don’t waste a single moment on it. It is good that you have remembered. Use that remembrance to be aware right now in whatever you are doing.\nSo, many times you will forget, many times you will remember. Slowly slowly, you will forget less, remember more. And one day it happens... whenever the balance of remembrance is more than the balance of forgetfulness, whenever it is weightier than your forgetfulness – instantly the revolution, the transformation. Suddenly you are a totally different man – the new man is born.\nAnd that new man will find this whole world new because he will have fresh eyes with new qualities to see, fresh ears with new ways to hear, new hands to feel and touch things in a new way. And a single man of that awareness starts triggering the process of awareness in others. Not by any effort, not that he has to do something to trigger the process – that doing has been our undoing – he has just to go on living his way, being his way, and it starts happening of its own accord.\nHis presence somehow starts something in people who come close to him... an arising of a new energy, the beginning of a new flame. He does nothing, nor does the other person do anything: it happens. All that is needed is a little closeness, friendship.\nAnd that’s what the function of the Master is – to gather friends around himself. There is no goal to be achieved, no particular activity to be done.\nThe function of the Master is just to remain available.\nOne never knows when somebody is on the borderline from where the jump can happen.\nOne never knows in what moment one is open – and just a look from the Master’s eyes, and things will never be the same again.\nBut these are all unpredictable moments, so one has to wait silently in awareness.\nThe most you can do is: don’t create barriers, don’t create hindrances, don’t keep yourself tight, away. Be relaxed... come closer.\nYou have nothing to lose – you have only to gain.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6978","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/from_misery_to_enlightenment/part13/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/from_misery_to_enlightenment/>From Misery to Enlightenment</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">13 Real love is real wild!</h1><div class=post-meta>33 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6978 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/From_Misery_to_Enlightenment/part13.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

THAN LOVE. AT THE SAME TIME, YOU SAY THAT ENLIGHTENMENT IS NEITHER LOVE
NOR HATE. ARE YOU SPEAKING OF TWO DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF LOVE? HOW DOES
THIS FIT WITH YOUR MESSAGE OF LOVE?</p><p><br></p><p>LOVE and hate are just two sides of the same coin. But with love
something very drastic has happened. It is unimaginable how this drastic
step was taken by people who had all the good intentions in the world.
You may never have even suspected what has destroyed love. It is the
continuous teaching of love that has destroyed it. Hate is still pure –
love is not.</p><p><br></p><p>When you hate, your hate has an authenticity. And when you love it is
only hypocrisy.</p><p>This has to be understood. For thousands of years all the religions,
politicians, pedagogues, have been teaching one thing, and that one
thing is love: Love your enemy, love your neighbor, love your parents,
love God.</p><p><br></p><p>Why in the beginning did they start this strange series of teachings
about love? They were afraid of your authentic love, because authentic
love is beyond their control. You are possessed by it. You are not the
possessor, you are the possessed. And every society wants you to be in
control.</p><p>The society is afraid of your wild nature, it is afraid of your
naturalness, so from the very beginning it starts cutting your wings.
And the most basic thing which is dangerous in you is the possibility of
love, because if you are possessed by love you can go even against the
whole world.</p><p><br></p><p>A small man possessed by love feels himself capable of doing the
impossible. In all old love stories this fact has emerged in a very
subtle way; and nobody has even bothered about it or even commented on
why this factor comes automatically into old love stories.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, in the East we have the most famous love stories of
Majnu and Laila. That is a Sufi story. It doesn’t matter whether it is
historical or not, that is not our concern. Our concern is its
structure, which is almost the same structure as all the love stories
around the world. The second famous Eastern love story is about Siri and
Farhad – but the structure is the same. The third famous story is about
Soni and Mahival, but the structure remains the same.</p><p><br></p><p>The structure is that the lover is asked to do something impossible;
if he can do that impossible thing then he can get the beloved. Of
course the parents and the society are not ready to accept this love
affair. No society is ready to accept any love affair, but to say no
seems to be unmannerly.</p><p><br></p><p>When somebody comes with a proposal of love you can’t just say no.
Even if you want to say no, and you will say no, a way has to be found –
and this is the way. Ask the lover to perform something impossible,
something which you know he cannot perform, which is an inhuman task.
And if he cannot perform it then you are not responsible; he himself has
failed.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a civilized way of saying no. Farhad is told that he can have
Siri if, alone, he can create a canal through the mountains and bring
the canal to the palace of the king – Siri is the daughter of the king.
And the canal has to be of milk, not of water.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this is absurd. In the first place, even if it was just going to
be a water canal, a young man, single-handed... and from the mountains,
hundreds of miles away, it will take thousands of years for him to bring
the canal to the palace. Even if it is accepted, hypothetically, that it
may be possible, how can he manage a canal of milk? From where will that
much milk go on continuously flowing through the canal? And the king
wants his palace gardens to be watered with milk – only then will Farhad
be qualified to ask for the hand of the king’s daughter.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been thinking about hundreds of love stories around the world,
but somehow or other this factor constantly appears: something
impossible is asked. My own understanding is that that factor does not
appear without any reason. There is somewhere in the unconscious of the
human mind the knowledge that love can make the impossible possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is so mad. Once you are possessed with love you don’t think in
terms of reason and logic, reality. You live in a world of dreams where
everything is within your hands. My only concern with these love stories
has been to find out something about love which is very essential, and
this is what I have found about it: Love makes you so mad that nothing
is impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>When Farhad is asked to do this job of making a canal from the
mountains thousands of miles away, he starts. He does not even say, “Are
you mad? What are you asking? You are making it impossible from the very
beginning. Why don’t you simply say no? Why go so roundabout?” No, he
does not say a single word; he simply takes a spade and moves towards
the mountains.</p><p>The people in the court of the king ask the king, “What have you
done? You know perfectly well this is not possible. You cannot do it, we
cannot do it – nobody can do it. You with all your army, with all your
forces, cannot bring this canal to the palace – and bringing milk from
where? Milk does not come out of streams in the mountains. You can
conquer the whole world – we know your power and we know your armies –
but that’s another matter. You cannot change the ways of nature.</p><p><br></p><p>“In the first place, that poor boy alone – you have told him he is
not to ask any help from anybody – is going to dig the canal from the
mountains to your palace. It will take millions of years for him, and
even if he manages to do it, from where is the milk going to come in the
canal?”</p><p><br></p><p>The king says, “I know all about it – it is not going to happen.
That’s why I have asked, that’s how I have thrown the whole
responsibility on him. Now, if he cannot do it, he is responsible. I am
saved from saying no to anybody.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the people in the court are more puzzled about the young man,
Farhad. They rush out, catch hold of him and ask him, “Are you mad or
something? Where are you going? It is not possible.”</p><p><br></p><p>Farhad says, “Everything is possible. Just my love has to be
authentic, to be true.”</p><p><br></p><p>Existence cannot deny love. Existence may change its nature, its
laws, but it cannot deny love because love is the highest law of nature.
For the higher law, lower laws can be erased, changed.</p><p><br></p><p>Those wise counsellors of the king are shocked by the answer, but the
answer seems to be significant. What the mad young man is saying makes
sense. The story is that Farhad succeeded. Alone he managed to create
the canal, and just because of his authenticity, his truthfulness, his
trust in existence, the water turned into milk.</p><p><br></p><p>This is just a story; I don’t think existence or nature is going to
change its laws. But one thing is certain: society became aware very
early that love is mad. And once a man is possessed of love then he is
beyond your control, then you cannot convince him of anything. Then no
reason is applicable, no logic makes any sense to him; his love is the
ultimate law. Everything else has to submit to it.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not saying that it does submit, I am not saying that nature is
going to change its ways, I am not saying that love will make miracles
possible. No, what I am saying is about this fear that love can make a
man so mad that he can start believing in things like this; then he is
beyond your control.</p><p><br></p><p>To keep man in control you have to, from a very early age, create a
false idea of love in him, and go on enforcing it continuously so he
never becomes possessed by authentic love and never goes mad, but always
remains sane. Sane means a slave to the rules of the society, sane means
a follower of the games of the society.</p><p><br></p><p>Love can make you rebellious. False love makes you obedient.</p><p>That’s why they teach you to love God. Now, telling a small child to
love God is such utter nonsense. The child does not know who God is, and
without knowing the object how do you expect him to love</p><p>God? But you pray to God with folded hands toward the sky, and the
child starts imitating you. God is there, above, in heaven – still –
although now everybody knows that the earth is round.</p><p><br></p><p>What is above to us is not above in India; it is below them, we are
below them. The sky that is above us is not above them. But people
around the earth are looking towards the sky and the God that lives
there above, in heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, knowing the fact that the earth is round – heaven is everywhere
above. And different corners of heaven are above different people; and
that too is not fixed because the earth is moving on its axis
continuously, so what was above you a few minutes before is no longer
above you. What was above a few hours before is no longer above you; it
may be below you.</p><p><br></p><p>Your God will have to perform a real circus act to fulfill your
desire that He remain above you. You have given Him such a task that
even if you give Him omnipotence he cannot manage it. It is simply not
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>But the small child simply starts imitating; whatever the parents are
doing, the child will start doing it. They go to the church – he goes to
the church. They go to the synagogue – he goes to the synagogue. This is
nurture against nature. And a man who can love God is a man who will
never know what love is.</p><p><br></p><p>Just think: a man who can love God without even knowing who this guy
is, where He is, whether He is or not, and if He is whether He is worth
loving – is He at all interested in you and in your love? A man, without
knowing any of these things, loves God, loves Jesus Christ, not knowing
whether this man was ever an historical person or not. If Christians’
stories about Christ are true then Christ cannot be historical. This is
a paradox.</p><p><br></p><p>If their stories about Jesus are true then Jesus cannot be true.
Jesus can be true only on one condition: if the stories told by
Christians about him are proved to be untrue. Now this is a difficult
problem, because if all the stories told about him by the Christians are
proved untrue, Christians will not be interested in such a Christ. They
were interested only because of those stories that you have proved
untrue.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus has meant nothing to them except those stories: the virgin
birth, his walking on water, his turning water into wine, his changing
stones into bread; his curing of blind people, crippled people,
paralyzed people; his raising of the dead to life. All these stories are
the basis for a Christian to have faith.</p><p><br></p><p>I am saying, if all these stories are true then Jesus is a
mythological figure. He cannot be an historical fact because real men
don’t walk on water. There is no way to change water into wine, there is
no way to change stones into bread.</p><p><br></p><p>In Jesus’ life itself you will find enough evidence that these things
cannot be true, because there are days when he and his disciples were
hungry and had to sleep with empty stomachs because the villagers they
had passed were very against him. They would not give him shelter, they
would not give him bread. But if this man was able to change stones into
bread, what was the problem?</p><p>In fact he could have changed the whole status of humanity, and there
would have been no need for Jews to crucify him, if he had provided the
whole of humanity with food. And there are enough stones in the world –
mountains! He could have changed the Himalayas into a big loaf, so
Indians could go on eating for centuries and centuries. He could have
changed oceans into wine so there would be no need to worry about it;
even poor people could afford the best wine, the oldest wine, the finest
wine.</p><p><br></p><p>If he was capable of raising the dead then rather than raising
Lazarus – who was of no use at all... I don’t see that raising Lazarus
was of any value. He should have chosen Moses, Abraham, Ezekiel – then
Jews would have worshipped him rather than crucifying him. If he had
raised all the old prophets, the Jews would have, without any question,
accepted him as the only begotten son of God. What would have been the
need to argue? – he could have proved himself by action.</p><p><br></p><p>But those stories are just stories. Jesus, to be historical, has to
be denuded of all those miracles. But once you drop all those miracles
Christians are no longer interested in Jesus. What is left in him? Why
should they believe in him?</p><p><br></p><p>They really never believed in him. That’s why I say that my religion
is the first and the last religion on the earth, because you are here
with me not for any miracle that I have performed. You are here with me
not because of anything that is special about me.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t carry any authority from God, I don’t have any support from
the scriptures. I am just as ordinary as you are.</p><p><br></p><p>Up to now this has never happened. People love Jesus because of his
miracles; take the miracles away and their love disappears. They were
attracted by the magical qualities, they were not concerned with Jesus
at all. They were interested in Krishna because he was the incarnation
of God and performed so many miracles. Just take those miracles away,
and Krishna is finished!</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot finish me. You can take anything away from me but you
cannot finish me, because I have not in any way tried to influence you,
impress you, by something which is superhuman. Everything can be taken
away from me, but your relationship towards me will remain the same; it
can’t be changed, because in the first place it is a simple
relationship.</p><p><br></p><p>Those relationships between Christians and Christ, and Jews and
Moses, and Hindus and Krishna, are not at all concerned with the
individual. If Jesus meets you on the way and tells you, “I am Jesus
Christ,” the first thing you will ask him is to walk on water.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot ask me that. You cannot even ask me to walk, because I
have never done even that miracle! Walking on water... you cannot ask me
because you will look foolish. But with Jesus, you can ask him and you
will be perfectly right. If he simply drowns in water then he is going
to drown. It is just against physical laws: he is going to drown.</p><p><br></p><p>Then what will be your relationship with a Jesus who drowns... you
have to run and jump and save him and give him artificial breathing.
What will be your relationship with this man? Just think of it. No, you
don’t have any relationship with Jesus, Mahavira, Buddha, Krishna, not
at all. Your attention is diverted.</p><p>They teach you to love Jesus. Why? Because he turned water into wine?
Even if he turned water into wine, that does not mean he deserves your
love. In fact he has committed a crime, he should be behind bars.
Turning water into wine without a license... you are going against the
law, against the government, against society. He should be punished – i
don’t see how he can deserve your love. And it is an old story – today
he would turn any vegetable into marijuana, hash.</p><p><br></p><p>President Ronald Reagan goes on quoting Jesus, not knowing about the
man, that if he was here and if he was to do any miracle – and he would
have to do a miracle because without that miracle he is nobody – then he
would be the biggest dope dealer in America. That would be the only
miracle that America would understand. He would not turn stones into
bread – there is enough bread in America – he would turn stones into
L.S.D.</p><p><br></p><p>No, he never did any of these things. But then your love and your
faith disappear. From the very childhood you have been told to love God,
whom you know not; you are not even certain that He exists. Your love
has been diverted in a direction which is absolutely imaginary, it has
no corresponding reality to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Your love for Jesus is not for Jesus but for things which any
mediocre mind feels impressed with. If you have a little bit of
intelligence you can see that all that is nonsense.</p><p>But from the very childhood they are diverting your love into unreal
dimensions. One thing which is a very cunning strategy is to give your
love a mode, a certain direction, which is unfulfillable; and because of
it, that which was fulfillable will not be attractive to you.</p><p><br></p><p>A man who has been taught to love God will feel that in loving a
woman or a man he is falling too low. God is there, far above, in the
heaven – and this is an ordinary man, an ordinary woman.</p><p><br></p><p>They have given your love an object so impossible that all that is
possible becomes below you. Even if, because of your nature, your
biology, you fall in love, there is a part in you which goes on saying,
“Something is wrong in it,” you go on feeling guilty. This is one thing
they have done to your love.</p><p><br></p><p>The second thing they have done is to say, “Love your mother.…” Why?
– “because she is your mother.” Is that enough for love to exist? Do you
have to love somebody because that somebody is your mother, your father,
your daughter, your brother, your sister? These relationships cannot
create love. They may create a certain kind of respect – she is your
mother and you can respect her. He is your father, you can respect him;
he has brought you up. But love is not something that you can
manage.</p><p><br></p><p>Respect is something within your hands, but love is not.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is something that when it comes it comes like a cyclone,
surrounds you, holds you totally in its grip.</p><p><br></p><p>You are no longer there.</p><p><br></p><p>Something higher than you, bigger than you, deeper than you, has
taken possession of you.</p><p>To avoid this they have been teaching you hypocrisy in the name of
love: Love your mother. Just because of this teaching – love your
father, love your mother, love your brother, love your wife, love your
husband, love your children – because it has been told so many times you
have never asked, “Is it possible? Is it within human capacity to love
somebody?” A very fundamental question has been completely
forgotten.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are told to love somebody, how are you going to do it? Yes,
you can act, you can pretend, you can repeat beautiful dialogues from
the movies you have been seeing, from the novels you have been reading.
You say beautiful things, but nothing is arising from you. You are not
in love, you are just doing a drama. And the tragedy is that most of us
continue our whole lives doing the rehearsal, not even the drama. The
time for the drama never comes just the rehearsal goes on and on.</p><p><br></p><p>And even if for a few people the time of drama comes, that drama is
also as unreal as anything can be, because your heart is not in it. It
is dead, it does not breathe. It has no warmth, no liveliness, no dance.
You are doing it because you have been trained to do it. It is a kind of
exercise, a gymnastics, an etiquette, a mannerism – anything – but not
love.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the ways they have spoiled your authenticity about
love.</p><p><br></p><p>Your question is, that I say love and hate are the same energy; then
why is there so much hate in the world and not so much love?</p><p><br></p><p>It is because nobody has been teaching you about hate; hence, hate
has remained pure, unadulterated. Nobody has bothered about you, nobody
has told you how to hate, whom to hate. Because hate has been left
untouched by your parents, teachers, and priests, it has a purity, a
sincerity.</p><p><br></p><p>When a man hates you, you can trust that he hates you. But when he
loves you, you cannot trust him.</p><p>You know perfectly well that when you hate someone it has a
tremendous force, and when you love someone there is not that force. You
remember your enemies more than your friends. You can forget your
friends but you cannot forget your enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>What is happening?</p><p><br></p><p>It is because your love has been distorted, and something unreal,
which is not love, has been handed to you. And you have been playing
with that toy called love, unaware that you have a potential of love
within you.</p><p><br></p><p>So when you love it is just so-so, skin-deep. Scratch it a little bit
and it is gone. But when you hate, you hate from your guts. It is not
skin-deep – it is gut-deep.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been surprised how much purity your hate has, how much
authenticity, naturalness, spontaneity. And just because of its
spontaneity, naturalness, authenticity, purity, I see in it a certain
beauty which is not there in your love. Your love is hocus-pocus.</p><p>This is the reason why in the world you don’t see so much love and
you see so much hate.</p><p><br></p><p>You listen to too much talk about love in the world. Everybody is
loving everybody else, talking about love, but it is all talk:
yakketty-yakketty-yak! It goes on all over the world. Everybody is
talking about love – beautiful dialogues – but in fact you see hate
everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>Religions hate each other. Nations hate each other. Political parties
hate each other. Classes hate each other. Just go on looking and you
will be surprised how many sources of hate there are.</p><p><br></p><p>And every ten years, twelve years, you need a world war – so much
hate and still it gets accumulated. Every day you go on expressing hate
that’s separate – still it goes on accumulating so much that every ten,
twenty years, it explodes into a world war.</p><p><br></p><p>In three thousand years, five thousand wars have been fought in the
world. Who is responsible? – the good-doers who are continuously after
you, teaching you about love, kindness, compassion. Nobody teaches you
about hate, so it is still there, far more strong, far more vibrant and
young and fresh.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like a time to come when nobody teaches you about love
either. You should be left alone. You should be told to be more aware
about whatsoever happens to you – hate or love, that is not
important.</p><p><br></p><p>What is important is that if you hate, hate with awareness. If you
love, love with awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>If I was going to teach you I would not tell you whom to love, how to
love. That is all nonsense. Love is your intrinsic quality. You are born
with it, just as hate is also there. I will teach you, be aware.</p><p><br></p><p>Before anything happens to you – love or hate, anger, passion,
compassion, anything – be aware. Let everything arise out of your
awareness.</p><p>And the miracle of awareness is that without your saying anything,
without your doing anything, it simply dissolves all that is ugly in you
into all that is beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>Awareness is a transforming force.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, if you are aware of anger, it will disappear. If you are
aware of love it will become stronger. If there is hate and you become
aware of it, it will disappear, dissipate. Soon you will find that that
cloud of hatred has disappeared and instead a totally opposite quality –
a mixture of compassion, kindness, lovingness – has been left behind
like an aroma.</p><p><br></p><p>To me this is the criterion:</p><p>Whatsoever deepens with your awareness is virtue. Whatsoever
disappears with your awareness is sin. To me this is the definition.</p><p>I don’t label any act as sin, virtue, right, wrong – acts don’t have
that quality. It is your awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>Just try it and you will be simply amazed that there are things in
you which cannot stand in front of awareness, they simply disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>Awareness functions almost like magic.</p><p><br></p><p>And what I am saying you can experiment with. I am not telling you to
believe in it, because belief will not help. You will have to experiment
with it. You will have to see, with the different things in you, what
remains and what disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is only you who can find what is right for you and what is
wrong for you. Then keep the thread of awareness running through all
your actions, and in your life you will not find any hate, any anger,
any jealousy. Not that you have dropped them, not that you have
repressed them, not that you have somehow got rid of them, not that you
have practiced doing something against them. No, you have not done
anything, you have not even touched them.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the beauty of awareness: it never represses anything; but
there are things which simply melt in the light of awareness and change.
And there are things which become more solid, more integrated, more
profound, more strong: love, compassion, kindness, friendliness,
understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions up to date have been focusing people’s minds on
actions; and labeling – this is bad, this is good, this you have to do,
this you have not to do.</p><p><br></p><p>I want to change the whole emphasis.</p><p><br></p><p>Actions have nothing to do with right and wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>It is you, your alertness, which is decisive. Any action with
awareness may become beautiful; the same action without awareness may be
ugly. With your awareness, the same action in one situation may
disappear, and in another situation may become solid, stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is not something like a fixed quality of any act, of any
emotion; it all depends on a thousand and one things. But your awareness
takes note of everything, you need not be worried. It is just like light
in which everything becomes clear to you, you can see it.</p><p><br></p><p>One Zen monk, throughout his whole life, was imprisoned again and
again. He was a great Master with thousands of disciples. Even the
magistrates loved him, respected him. And they prayed of him, “Why do
you do such strange things? We can’t understand, it is beyond our
comprehension” – because he was stealing small things from his own
disciples, and naturally the law had to take its course.</p><p><br></p><p>The magistrates would say, “We know there is something else in it.
Why should you steal one shoe of somebody’s? – it is useless, you cannot
use it. And now we have to send you for two months into jail.” The Zen
Master was always very happy when he heard, and he used to say to the
magistrates, “Can’t you send me for a little longer? – because anyway,
when I come out I will do it again, and you will have to send me in
again. Why can’t you send me for a longer period and save me from doing
all these things?”</p><p>Only in the end, when he was dying, did his disciples ask, “Now let
us at least ask, because we will never again have a chance to know what
was the reason you were stealing things, things which mattered not at
all to you. We were always ready to bring anything you wanted, but you
never said anything, you never asked for anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>He laughed. He said, “The real reason was I wanted to be as long as
possible in the jail because there are three thousand people in the
jail, and I have found in those three thousand people more innocent,
more natural human beings than I find outside the jail. And outside the
jail there are many masters and many religions, and they are doing their
work. Nobody takes care of those poor people. When I am in the jail I
teach them meditation, I teach them how to be aware – the jail has
become a monastery!</p><p><br></p><p>“We have changed it completely. All the prisoners are meditating. The
jailer cannot detect it because they are simply doing everything with
awareness. They are continuing to do the same work as before: if cutting
wood, then cutting wood; if cutting rocks, then cutting rocks; if making
roads, then making roads. Whatever they were doing before they are doing
now, but with a great difference.</p><p><br></p><p>“And the best monastery I know right now,” he said, “is the jail
where I have been going continually, because this jail has people who
are sentenced for life – twenty years, thirty years. Now, this is a
great opportunity: for thirty years they can meditate without any
disturbance from the outside world. Where else could I find such
people?</p><p><br></p><p>“And I am immensely happy because I am leaving behind me, in that
jail, a thread which will continue for centuries. This jail will remain
a totally different jail. Whoever comes there is bound to get involved
in meditation because some old-timers will always be there.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, looking at it from the outside, a man stealing is doing
something wrong, and a man continually going to jail, being sentenced
again and again, is certainly a criminal. But if you look at that man’s
consciousness and the act out of that consciousness, it is totally
different.</p><p><br></p><p>Never judge anybody by his act, because the real thing is not the act
but the consciousness through which that act has been performed. But we
all judge by acts because acts are available outside like objects.
Consciousness we don’t know.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened in a Zen monastery... there were two wings, a left wing
and a right wing – the monastery was just made in that way. Five hundred
monks lived in one wing, five hundred in the other wing, and the
Master’s house was just in the middle of both.</p><p><br></p><p>The Master had a cat, a very beautiful cat, and all the disciples
were very loving towards the cat. But once in a while there was a
quarrel because the left wingers wanted the cat – they were having some
party, some fun – but the right wingers were not willing to allow them
the cat at that time. The cat became a constant object of quarrels,
fights.…</p><p><br></p><p>One day the Master called all the disciples and asked them to bring
the cat. He told them, “You both love the cat, but the cat is only one.”
So he cut the cat in two – it was a shock to all the disciples – and
told them, “Now you can have half, and you can have half. Now no more
quarreling in this monastery.”</p><p>There was silence. They could not understand that such a non-violent
person could cut the cat in two. They all wondered and worried and
thought about it. The story reached the king, who was also a disciple of
the Master. He could not contain his curiosity; he came the next day. He
asked, “I have heard that you have killed your most loved cat.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Master said, “I have not killed the cat, I have killed a
conflict, a quarrel which was growing every day and was growing out of
proportion. And these fools won’t understand unless I take a drastic
step. I have not killed the cat, because nobody dies. The cat is freed
from this body because of these fools. And anyway she was going to die;
she had already lived long enough – perhaps she would have lived one
year or two more years at the most.</p><p><br></p><p>“So before killing her I became totally silent, aware, and asked
myself, ‘What is this poor cat going to do in those two years? Nothing.
But in two years these fools will do much.’</p><p><br></p><p>“I have not killed the cat out of anger, I have not killed the cat
out of hate. I loved her and I love her more now because she helped to
solve a problem. And it was a good shock to these idiots, because
without shocks their minds don’t function. Once in a while you have to
hit them.”</p><p><br></p><p>And certainly it happened from that day all kinds of quarreling
simply disappeared, because those disciples became aware that this man
is dangerous, he can kill somebody; the quarrel can be too hazardous.
All arguments ceased.</p><p><br></p><p>And the king was absolutely satisfied. He said, “This has always been
your teaching, that it is not the act but the consciousness. We can only
see the act; we don’t know in what consciousness you did it. That is
only known to you. Who are we to decide about it?”</p><p><br></p><p>Never judge anybody by the act.</p><p><br></p><p>Wait. Try to find out his awareness – otherwise don’t judge at all.
It is safer not to judge. And about yourself, remember, whatsoever you
are doing, keep only one thing in mind, that you are doing it with full
awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>Then I allow you total freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>No religion has allowed you freedom. I allow you total freedom.</p><p>No religion has given you responsibility unto yourself, no religion
has given you the right to decide what is right, what is wrong. I give
you the right, the responsibility, because to me everything arises out
of a single source – and that is awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>The question says that I have talked about love, my message is about
love, and I also have said that the man of enlightenment has neither
love nor hate. Now, rather than asking me, you are mature enough to work
out simple things. It is so simple: when through awareness the whole
hate energy turns into love, it is totally a new phenomenon – it needs a
new name. But what to do? Languages are poor so we have to use the same
words, giving them different meanings, definitions.</p><p>My message of love is not the message of that love which is the polar
opposite of hate. My message of love is of that love which is capable of
absorbing hate and transforming it.</p><p>Now, the question arises that if there is no more hate, how and why
should this new energy be called love?</p><p><br></p><p>Love, in our minds, is something against hate. Now, there is no
opposite to love. That’s why, once in a while, I have been reminding you
that the man of enlightenment has neither hate nor love – that is to
deny your hate and your love. Love and hate as polarities, he has none.
That does not mean that he is indifferent, although that’s how it will
appear to you. That’s why I speak of the poverty of language.</p><p><br></p><p>If the man of enlightenment has no love, no hate, that means he will
be indifferent, neutral – no, that is not the meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>He has a new kind, a new quality of love which is not opposed to
hate. Now, there is no word for it; so either I have to say he has no
hate, no love the way you have, or I have to say that his love is a
totally new kind of love; a love which is closer to compassion than to
passion, which is closer to a relatedness than to a relationship; a love
which is more a giving without asking anything in return than your
so-called love. which is a bargain – where each party is trying to get
more and give less.</p><p><br></p><p>The enlightened man simply gives.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not that he wants to get something from you – you don’t have
anything to give to him. What do you have to give him?</p><p><br></p><p>He gives because he has too much to give, he is overburdened.</p><p><br></p><p>He gives because he is like a raincloud, so full of rain that it has
to shower. It does not matter where, on whom – on rocks, on good soil,
on gardens, in the ocean... it doesn’t matter at all. The cloud simply
wants to unburden itself.</p><p><br></p><p>The enlightened man is just like a raincloud.</p><p><br></p><p>He gives you love, not to get anything back. He shares it and is
obliged to you that you allowed him the opportunity; that you were open
enough, available, vulnerable; that you did not reject when he was ready
to pour all his blessings on you; that you opened your heart and
received as much as was within your capacity.</p><p><br></p><p>The world can be full of love, the love I am talking about. And only
that love will transform the hatred in the world – not the love that has
been taught to you. That has not made the world more loving, it has made
the world more hateful: made its hate truer and more authentic and its
love more of a hypocrisy.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like a world full of love. But remember, that love has no
opposite to it. It is simply because you inside yourself have been able,
through awareness, to transform your hate into love. Even to</p><p>say that you have been able to transform it is not right, but what
else to do with language? Whatever you say, something is wrong in saying
it, something goes wrong in saying it.</p><p><br></p><p>The fact is, awareness itself transforms your hate into love, not
that you transform it. Your work and function is simply to remain aware.
Don’t let anything happen in your life without awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>I am giving you the simplest and the most natural religion possible.
That’s why I say it is the first and the last, because it cannot be
simplified more. There is nothing more below awareness; we have come to
the very last root. There is no way to go beyond it, further than it.
This is it!</p><p><br></p><p>Just go on doing all the things that you are doing, but keep aware.
Make it a constant remembrance that no act passes in
unconsciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>It will take a little time. Every day you will miss many things;
later on you will remember, “My God! I forgot again.” But there is
nothing to be worried about. Don’t get worried about it, otherwise you
are going to miss something else. That which is gone is gone – don’t
waste a single moment on it. It is good that you have remembered. Use
that remembrance to be aware right now in whatever you are doing.</p><p><br></p><p>So, many times you will forget, many times you will remember. Slowly
slowly, you will forget less, remember more. And one day it happens...
whenever the balance of remembrance is more than the balance of
forgetfulness, whenever it is weightier than your forgetfulness –
instantly the revolution, the transformation. Suddenly you are a totally
different man – the new man is born.</p><p><br></p><p>And that new man will find this whole world new because he will have
fresh eyes with new qualities to see, fresh ears with new ways to hear,
new hands to feel and touch things in a new way. And a single man of
that awareness starts triggering the process of awareness in others. Not
by any effort, not that he has to do something to trigger the process –
that doing has been our undoing – he has just to go on living his way,
being his way, and it starts happening of its own accord.</p><p><br></p><p>His presence somehow starts something in people who come close to
him... an arising of a new energy, the beginning of a new flame. He does
nothing, nor does the other person do anything: it happens. All that is
needed is a little closeness, friendship.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s what the function of the Master is – to gather friends
around himself. There is no goal to be achieved, no particular activity
to be done.</p><p><br></p><p>The function of the Master is just to remain available.</p><p><br></p><p>One never knows when somebody is on the borderline from where the
jump can happen.</p><p><br></p><p>One never knows in what moment one is open – and just a look from the
Master’s eyes, and things will never be the same again.</p><p><br></p><p>But these are all unpredictable moments, so one has to wait silently
in awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>The most you can do is: don’t create barriers, don’t create
hindrances, don’t keep yourself tight, away. Be relaxed... come
closer.</p><p>You have nothing to lose – you have only to gain.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

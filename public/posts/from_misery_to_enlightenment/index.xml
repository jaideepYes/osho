Your birthright: to take flight
29 January 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
SEEING AND HEARING YOU SPEAK, ONE THING CONTINUES TO STRIKE ME: FROM YOUR EARLIEST CHILDHOOD, UP UNTIL THE LATEST SPLIT SECOND, YOU HAVE ALWAYS HAD SO MUCH SELF-RESPECT AND SO MUCH SELF-DELIGHT. ARE WE ALL CAPABLE OF SO MUCH?
MAN is not aware of what he is capable unless he comes to realize it.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Drop god, drop guilt – become religious
7 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACCEPTING MYSELF AND LOVING MYSELF?
THERE is great difference between the two. Accepting yourself is a much lower state of consciousness – better, of course, than rejecting yourself. It is a medicine; the disease is rejection. And anything medicinal has no permanent or ultimate value; its value is only in curing the disease.</description>

Consciousness: the only criterion of virtue
8 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR US? I FEEL ITS IMPORTANCE MORE AND MORE, BUT I AM ALSO CONFUSED ABOUT IT. AM I AVOIDING SOMETHING?
THE problem of responsibility is one of the most fundamental issues. But before we can go into it, a few words will have to be understood rightly.</description>

God: an idea whose time has come – and gone
9 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
ARE YOU AGAINST GOD AND JESUS CHRIST TOO? IT FREAKS ME OUT.
IT freaks me out too. How I can be against God, who does not exist at all? To be for or to be against, one thing is absolutely necessary, the existence of God.</description>

Real love is real wild!
10 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
YOU SAY THAT LOVE AND HATE ARE ONE; BUT I SEE MORE HATE IN THE WORLD THAN LOVE. AT THE SAME TIME, YOU SAY THAT ENLIGHTENMENT IS NEITHER LOVE NOR HATE. ARE YOU SPEAKING OF TWO DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF LOVE? HOW DOES THIS FIT WITH YOUR MESSAGE OF LOVE?</description>

‌CHAPTER 14
Don’t walk on water – jump into consciousness
11 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
DO MIRACLES REALLY NOT EXIST?
I am sorry to disappoint you, but I can’t help it.
I cannot give you the consolation that has been given by all the religions down the centuries. I cannot do it because that consolation has cost too much.</description>

From oy-veh to ole
12 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHY IS THE WORLD IN SO MUCH MISERY? WHY CAN’T WE ALL BE JUST AS BLISSFUL AS YOU ALWAYS ARE?
THE child is the father of the man, and down the centuries we have been destroying the child. And once the child is destroyed, the whole life becomes unnatural, miserable, meaningless.</description>

13 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
I HEARD YOU SAY THAT JESUS’ FINGER POINTING TO THE MOON IS NOT A VERY GOOD ONE. IS THERE A BETTER ONE?
I have never said that. I could not have said it because Jesus’ finger is not pointing to the moon at all.</description>

‌CHAPTER 17
Religion begins where ideas end
14 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHY ARE YOU DESTROYING THE GREAT RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND IDEOLOGIES OF THE WORLD?
I am not in favor of destroying anything at all. My whole approach is creative.
But creation involves destruction. That is not my problem. Creation itself is not possible without destroying something. The moment you create something you are simultaneously destroying something else.</description>

In the silences, the semi-colons and the full stops...
15 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THING ABOUT ENLIGHTENMENT?
THE most significant thing about enlightenment is that it is the most insignificant thing in the world.
The scriptures are full of great attributes, qualities, about enlightenment. It is the highest peak human consciousness has ever achieved.</description>

16 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS THE GREATEST PROBLEM IN THE WORLD?
THE greatest problem or the smallest problem, it is the same: man. And when I say man, I do not mean something abstract. I mean I, you, he, she. There exists no man as such, separate from human beings.</description>

Meditation – jumping board to your being
30 January 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS MEDITATION?
IT is the most important question as far as my religion is concerned. Meditation is the very center of my whole effort.
It is the very womb out of which the new religion is going to be born.
But it is very difficult to verbalize it.</description>

‌CHAPTER 20
The pagan: chrysalis of consciousness
17 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WERE PAGANS RELIGIOUS?
THE Christians have given such a condemnatory definition to the word pagan that it has become almost the meaning of the word. To be a pagan, according to the Christians, is to be irreligious. The reality is just the reverse.
Christianity is a pseudo-religion.</description>

My message – a matter of life and death
18 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHY ARE PEOPLE NOT LISTENING TO YOUR MESSAGE?
THERE are many things to be understood before we can enter into the question.
First, the word people.… There are no “people” as such. There are Americans, Russians, Indians; there are Christians, Hindus, Mohammedans; there are socialists, communists, fascists – but where are the people?</description>

Exactly how do you do it!
19 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
EXACTLY HOW DO YOU NOT DO IT?
THE easiest thing in the world is always the most difficult. For the simple reason that it is easy, it becomes difficult.
This is not a puzzle but the simple logic of the ego. You will have to understand that logic.</description>

You’ll never find a lion in the lion’s club
20 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHY ARE PEOPLE SO FANATICALLY COMMITTED TO GROUPS AND ORGANIZATIONS OF ALL KINDS: RELIGIOUS, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL?
MAN’S mind is a Pandora’s box.
It contains the whole of evolution from the lowest creature to the highest genius. They are all living together in man’s mind simultaneously, they are all contemporaries.</description>

Question 1 OSHO,
I WAS SHOCKED TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT THE PYRAMID OF HUMANITY CONSISTS ONLY OF AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI AND ALBERT EINSTEIN, AND THERE IS NO QUALITATIVE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO. ISN’T THERE A THIRD ALTERNATIVE?
I am shocked too, but one is helpless against the reality.</description>

Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS RELIGION, AND WHY ARE THERE SO MANY RELIGIONS IN THE WORLD? IS IT NOT POSSIBLE TO HAVE JUST ONE RELIGION FOR THE WHOLE HUMANITY?
RELIGION is an inquiry just the way science is, with one difference:
Science inquires about the objective reality – that which is there, outside of you.</description>

Innocence – the natural outlaw
23 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS CORRUPTION? DOES IT COME IN A SEED OR IS IT LEARNED?
NATURE is absolutely innocent.
It knows nothing which can be called corruption. Corruption is something manufactured by man.
The child is born absolutely innocent, there is no seed of corruption in him. The corruption is created by the society for its own purposes.</description>

AIDS: disease of the existential orphan
25 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WOULD YOU PLEASE SAY SOMETHING ABOUT AIDS?
I do not know anything about even the first aids, and you are asking me about the last AIDS! But it seems I will have to say something about it. And in a world where people who know nothing about themselves can talk about God, people who know nothing about the geography of the earth can talk about heaven and hell, it is not inconceivable for me to say something about AIDS, although I am not a physician.</description>

31 January 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS INITIATION ACCORDING TO YOU?
THE search for truth is as old as man himself. But there are many kinds of seekers.
The first category I call the curious.
They are the most superficial. They are not read to do anything, sacrifice anything, make any effort. Their curiosity is just like a child’s curiosity – he goes on asking about everything.</description>

1 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS INTUITION, AND WHAT IS ITS PLACE IN YOUR RELIGION?
IT is a little bit complex, because a few other things will have to be understood first; then you can understand what intuition is.
Intuition is the highest rung of the ladder, the ladder of consciousness.</description>

2 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove
Question 1 OSHO,
DO VALUES LIKE LOVE, RELIGIOUSNESS, AUTHENTICITY, HAPPINESS, CHANGE AS HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS GROWS UPWARDS?
THE movement of human consciousness from darkness to light, from unconsciousness to consciousness, is the greatest revolution there is.
Everything in human life changes, even with a slight movement in consciousness. All depends on where your consciousness is.</description>

From idiotocracy to meritocracy
5 February 1985 pm in Lao Tzu Grove

DO MIRACLES REALLY NOT EXIST?

I cannot do it because that consolation has cost too much. It has not given anything; on the contrary, it has taken away your very religiousness.\nI cannot say anything that in the short-term may seem to help your growth towards religion, but in the long-term is simply poison. That’s what the idea of a miracle is.\nThe human mind is begging for it. It is the need of a sick mind – but all minds are sick. Mind as such is the sickness of man.\nWhen the mind disappears you are, for the first time, really healthy and whole. Mind needs all kinds of poisons to continue to exist. The idea of miracles is one of the most important. The idea is absolutely against existence.\nFirst you have to understand, what does a miracle mean? It means that existence is not trustable, that nature is not unprejudiced, that the laws of life allow exceptions. This is an absolute absurdity.\nExistence has no prejudices – that for Jesus it has a soft corner in the heart, and not for you; that it allows Mohammed to go beyond natural laws, but it does not allow you. A miracle simply is a condemnation of the fairness of existence.\nNo, there is no such thing as a miracle – never has been, never will be. If miracles happen then science cannot happen; and we know that science has happened. And as science has grown, miracles have diminished in exact proportion. The more science grows, the less and less are there miracles. If you go farther back you can find thousands of miracles happening.\nMost of those miracles are just stories invented to create messiahs, prophets, reincarnations of God – because how can you manage to put a certain man above all humanity? How can you manage to make him superhuman? His body follows nature, his life follows nature. From birth to death there is not a single exception.\nBut the fools around the world will not accept an ordinary man as enlightened. They need a superman, only then is their mind satisfied: Of course, he is a superman, a messenger of God; he can be enlightened – but how can we poor human beings be enlightened?\nAnd how to prove that he is superior to you? Just look: Jesus is not superior as far as intelligence is concerned, shows no special intelligence. There were hundreds of more learned rabbis, great scholars of profound intelligence; he is just an uneducated, unpolished carpenter’s son.\nBy intelligence he cannot prove – nor can his followers – that he is superior, that he is special, that he is the only begotten son of God. By physical strength he cannot prove that either. Any Muhammad Ali will throw him flat. Just by a single hit on his nose he is finished. Physically he cannot prove that he is superior.\nNow these are the only two things in human life where you find.Somebody is an Albert Einstein,\na Bertrand Russell, a Jean-Paul Sartre – they have proved intellectually they are sharper, more talented. But a strange thing is, they don’t claim they are the only begotten son of God. No intelligent person can claim such an unintelligent thing.\nOr there are people who are physically talented. They may come first in the Olympic race, in some game, in some wrestling, but that simply shows a difference between you and them of quantity, not of quality. Howsoever powerful a man may be, he is only quantitatively different from you; and the difference of quantity is no difference at all.\nIf you had worked on the same lines with the same gymnastics for the same time, perhaps you might have proved even a better wrestler, a better runner. All that is proved is that this man has practiced a certain talent. Certainly he should be respected – but he does not become the messenger of God.\nThere are people who are world champions in chess playing. Certainly they have a tremendously complicated mind. A real chess player has to think five moves ahead. When you play chess you only think of one move ahead, at the most two moves; more than that and you will get puzzled.\nFive is the minimum to become a world champion. Five moves means you take one move, the other person will take a move. You have to visualize what he is going to take, then what you will do, then\nwhat he will do, then what you will do – five times. You have to be clear about five moves ahead, only then can you be a world champion; otherwise it is impossible. That much concentration, practice... it is a maddening thing.\nBut even then, somebody becoming a world champion in chess is not a prophet. He has a mind closer to a computer than you have. Your mind is simpler, a little more primitive a computer; his mind is a little more sophisticated a computer. Your mind can be trained also in the same way. It is only a question of training. The difference is only of degrees, there is no difference of quality. He is just as human a being as you are.\nThen how to prove that Jesus, Mohammed, Mahavira, Buddha, Krishna – that these people are not just ordinary like you? The way that has been discovered is called the miracle. That makes them qualitatively different from you, because whatsoever you do, you cannot get trained in walking on water. Whatever you do you will be drowned again and again. So it is not a question of training, discipline, knowing certain strategies – no, nothing will help. How can you turn stones into bread? How can you turn water into wine?\nThese stories are invented for a certain purpose – to make that man qualitatively higher than you. But this is exploiting humanity, corrupting human consciousness, giving people false ideas.\nJust look at these miracle-men of the world and you can see that of all those miracles, ninety percent were invented by the followers or by the originators themselves. It is difficult at such a long distance to know who started them. Most of them must have been started by the originators themselves, and of course followers go on adding to them.\nIt becomes an absolute necessity for followers to go on adding more and more miracles, because it is a competitive business and everybody has to prove his messiah the highest, the greatest. Everybody else is below him. Now, only miracles can do that miracle, there is no other way.\nJainas have twenty-four tirthankaras, twenty-four messiahs. Because Jainas had twenty-four, Buddhists were at a loss; they had only one – Gautam Buddha. In the market – and this whole world is a market and every human being is a customer – when you are selling your messiah, your religion, your holy book, small things count. A Buddhist feels at a loss because people ask how many buddhas there have been. lust one? Looks very poor – Jainas have twenty-four!\nHindus up to that moment had ten incarnations of God. They immediately changed to twenty- four because ten looked poor before twenty-four. The idea of Jainas having twenty-fourBefore\nMahavira, all Hindu scriptures talk of ten avataras; after Mahavira suddenly a great change happens – Hindus start talking about twenty-four.\nBuddhists are at a loss because their religion starts with Buddha, so where to put twenty-four buddhas? But they have to be a little more creative. They started talking about twenty-four lives of Gautam Buddha – this was the twenty-fourth life. He had been an awakened one twenty-three times before.\nYou can see a clever legal process. They had no historical grounds to prove that there had been twenty-four buddhas. Even Buddha cannot say that because he was the originator. But this was easy, to invent twenty-three previous lives.\nThe span is thousands of years, and in those days particularly in India history was not written. History was not even counted as a subject. Writing history was introduced by the Mohammedans in India. In India the idea was that history consists of mundane, ordinary, day to day things, which go on being repeated. A king is born, a king dies; another king will be there, he will die. Empires are built and disappear.\nIf you look at the millions of years in India it has been the custom to look at existence extending for millions and millions of years – what does it matter that a man was a prime minister for three months in a country? Why bother? For three months out of millions and millions of years, in a country on a very mediocre planet, of a very mediocre solar system, a certain man was prime minister – why bother? The Indian attitude is, why unnecessarily waste time?\nSo instead of history... the Indian word for history is very significant. It is itihas. The word means “that which comes and disappears like a soap bubble” the end is not very far from the beginning. So instead they used to write puranas. Now, the word puranas means something not concerned with individuals but with essentials.\nFor example, a tirthankara is not just a person. There are only twenty-four tirthankaras in one creation, and one creation means millions and millions of years. Each tirthankara simply represents the essence of consciousness touching the highest peak. In millions of years only twenty-four times has human consciousness risen so high that it touches the ultimate.\nNow, this is essential. When Mahavira was born and when he died – that is history – doesn’t matter; any date will do. What difference does it make whether he was born twenty-five centuries ago or twenty-six centuries ago, on Monday, on Sunday, on Saturday – what does it matter? What matters is that a consciousness reached a peak.\nIf you go in a Jaina temple you will be surprised to see twenty-four tirthankaras all looking exactly alike. This is impossible, that all these twenty-four persons – and they were born over a long period of thousands of years – looked absolutely alike. Their noses, their eyes, even their ear lobes... because a Jaina tirthankara’s ear lobes have to be so long that they touch the shoulder – on all twenty-four tirthankaras.\nYou cannot say whose statue this is – even Jainas cannot say whose statue this is. So they had to make, near the feet, a symbol: a lion represents Mahavira, a peacock represents somebody else.… So if you ask a Jaina he will just immediately look at the symbol near the feet. Only by the symbol can he say who this is; otherwise they are all alike.\nIt certainly is not history. No two persons are ever born exactly alike; to find twenty-four people exactly alike is impossible. But they are not concerned with those persons – their bodies, their noses, their ears – their concern is with their consciousness; and everything else is representing symbolically the highest peak of consciousness.\nFor example, the ear lobes touching the shouldersPerhaps once in a while you may find a person\nwhose ear lobes do touch, but I have never seen one. I have seen millions of people and I have looked at their ears, but I have never seen a single person whose ear lobes touched the shoulders. Just one person I know – he was a colleague of mine in my high-school classes – who had special kind of ears.\nHe could move them according to his will and wish. You cannot do it. You don’t have muscles, you cannot do anything with your ears. Just try to do something; you cannot do anything. But this boy was a miracle! He could turn his ears down, up, move them in and out.\nHe is now a doctor, but more famous for his ears than anything else. Patients will come and ask, “Doctor, please, just show your ears.” I have been searching for a second person who can do that even better – I have not found one. Some freak of natureIt seems he has some muscles and\nnerves in his ears which are not needed, so he can pull his ears and do things with them.\nBut what were these tirthankaras doing with ears that long? One thing, it is not history, so it is not representative of reality; it is representative of something different. To me those long ears simply mean that these people were capable of listening. Now, how do you represent in a marble statue that they were totally capable of listening? Now, to represent that, they don’t care about history; it is puranas. Puranas means we are concerned about the essentials.\nAll these twenty-four statues have their eyes half-closed. You can see only the lower white part of the eyes; otherwise the eyes are closed. But why half? That is the only difference you will find in a Buddhist statue and a Jaina statue: the Buddha’s statue has the eyes completely closed.\nAgain, it is not history. They are not saying anything about these people; they are saying that a man who touches the highest consciousness is so complete that the outer and the inner become one. His half-closed eyes symbolize that the outer half and the inner half are meeting. This is what I mean by essence.\nMahavira had twenty-three predecessors – Buddha was in a difficulty. And there were so many miracles about those twenty-three predecessors of Mahavira that Buddha looked poor. So first he had to create the idea that he had been a buddha twenty-three times before; and then about those twenty-three buddhas he created miracles. Perhaps the miracles about him are created by his disciples later on, but he must have initiated them in some way.\nAt least one thing is certain, that none of these fellows prevented their disciples by saying, “Don’t do this mischief to me.” Even if they had not created the miracles themselves they allowed them by remaining silent. If the rumors were going around that they were doing miracles or miracles were happening, there is not a single statement from Krishna, Buddha, Jesus, Mahavira, Mohammed, which says no, these were rumors.\nMy mother was just telling me yesterdayand Vivek listened to her talking so animatedly for the\nfirst time in so long; otherwise whatever she has to ask is answered in one or two sentences; yes or no, and the conversation is over. But yesterday she was talking for a long time and she was very animated, so Vivek asked me, “What was your mother telling you?”\nI told her she was remembering a few things. I have not told her yet what she was telling me, because it was a long story. She was telling me that when I was five months old in her womb, a miracle happened.\nShe was going from my father’s house to her father’s house; and it was the rainy season. It is customary in India for the first child to be born at the maternal father’s home, so although it was the\nrainy season and very difficult – no roads, and she had to go on a horse – the sooner she went, the better; if she waited longer then it would have become more difficult, so she went with one of her cousin-brothers.\nIn the middle of the journey was a big river, the Narmada. It was in flood. When they reached the boat, the boatman saw that my mother was pregnant, and he asked my mother’s cousin-brother, “What is your relationship?”\nHe was not aware that he would get into trouble so he simply said, “We are brother and sister.”\nThe boatman refused; he said, “I cannot take you because your sister is pregnant – that means you are not two, you are three.”\nIn India, this is a custom, an old custom – perhaps it started in the days of Krishna – that one should not travel on water, particularly in a boat, with one’s sister’s son. There is a danger of the boat sinking.\nThe boatman said, “What guarantee is there that the child in your sister’s womb is a girl and not a boy? If he is a boy I don’t want to take the risk – because it is not a question only of my life, sixty other people are going in the boat. Either you can come or your sister can come; both I won’t take.”\nOn both sides there were hills and jungle, and the boat used to go only one time a day. In the morning it would go – and the river is really vast at that point – and then it would come back by the evening. The next morning it would go again, the same boat. So either my mother had to remain on this side, which was dangerous, or go on that side, which was just as dangerous. So for three days they continued to ask him, beg him, saying that she was pregnant and he should be kind.\nHe said, “I can’t help it – this is not done. If you can give me a guarantee that it is not a boy then I can take you; but how can you give me a guarantee?”\nSo for three days they had to stay in a temple there. In that temple lived a saint, very famous in those days in that area. Now, around that temple there has arisen a city in the memory of that saint, Saikheda. Saikheda means “the village of the saint.” Sai means the saint; he was known as Sai Baba. It is not the same Sai Baba who became world-famous – Sai Baba of Shirdi – but they were contemporaries.\nSai Baba of Shirdi became world-famous because of the simple coincidence that Shirdi is near Bombay, and all the celebrities of Bombay and the rich people of Bombay started going to Sai Baba of Shirdi. And the richer you are, the more famous you are, the more successful you are, the more you are in need of something to give you fulfillment, because all your success, your riches, your fame has brought you nothing. These are the emptiest people in the world, the hollowest. And because of Bombay being a world center, soon Sai Baba of Shirdi’s name started reaching outside India, and so many miracles were created around him.\nThe same was the situation with this Sai Baba who lived in that temple. Finally my mother had to ask Sai Baba, “Can you do something? For three days we have been here. I am pregnant and my brother has told the boatman that he is my brother, and he won’t take us in the boat. Now, unless\nyou do something, say something to that boatman, we are in a fix. What to do? My brother cannot leave me here alone; I cannot go alone to the other side. On both sides are wild jungles and forests, and for at least twenty-four hours I will have to wait alone.”\nI never met Sai Baba, but in a way I did meet him; I was five months old. He just touched my mother’s belly. My mother said, “What are your doing?”\nHe said, “I am touching the feet of your child.”\nThe boatman saw this and said, “What are you doing, Baba? You have never touched anybody’s feet.”\nAnd Baba said, “This is not anybody; and you are a fool – you should take them to the other side. Don’t be worried. The soul that is within this womb is capable of saving thousands of people, so don’t be worried about your sixty people – take her.”\nSo my mother was saying, “At that time I became aware that I was carrying someone special.”\nI said, “As far as I understand, Sai Baba was a wise man: he really befooled the boatman! There is no miracle, there is nothing. And boats don’t sink just because somebody is traveling with their sister’s son. There is no rationality in the idea, it is just absurd. Perhaps sometime accidentally it may have happened and then it became a routine idea.”\nMy own understanding is that because in Krishna’s life his mother’s brother was told by the astrologers that “one of the children of your sister will kill YOU,” he kept his sister and his brother- in-law in prison. She gave birth to seven children, seven boys, and he killed them all. The eighth was Krishna, and of course when God Himself was born, the locks of the prison opened up, and the guards fell fast asleep, and Krishna’s father took him out.\nThe river Yamuna was the boundary of Kansa’s kingdom. Kansa was the person who was killing his sister’s sons in the fear that one of the sons was going to kill him. The Yamuna was in flood – and it is one of the biggest rivers in India. The father of Krishna was very much afraid, but somehow the child had to be taken to the other side, to a friend’s house whose wife had given birth to a girl so he could exchange them. He could bring the girl back with him because the next morning Kansa would be there asking, “Where is the child?” and planning to kill him. A girl he wouldn’t kill – it had to be a boy.\nBut how to cross this river? There was no boat in the night, but it had to be crossed. But when God can open locks without keys, without anybody opening them – they simply opened up, the doors opened up, the guards fell asleep – God would do something.\nSo he put the child in a bucket on his head and passed through the river – something like what happened to Moses when the ocean parted. This time it happened in an Indian way. It could not have happened to Moses because that ocean was not Indian, but this river was.\nAs he entered the river, the river started rising higher. He was very much afraid: what was happening? He was hoping the river would subside, but it started rising. It went to the point where\nit touched the feet of Krishna, then it receded. This is the Indian way, it cannot happen anywhere else. How can the river miss such a point? When God is born and passing through her, just giving way is not enough, not mannerly.\nSince that time there has been this idea that there is a certain antagonism between a person and his sister’s son, because Krishna killed Kansa. The river was crossed, it subsided; it favored the child. Since then rivers are angry against maternal uncles – all the rivers of India. And that superstition is carried even today.\nI told my mother, “One thing is certain – that Sai Baba must have been a wise man and had some sense of humor.” But she wouldn’t listen. And it became known in the village what had happened, and to support it, after one month another thing happened which.… In life there are so many coincidences out of which you can make miracles. Once you are bent upon making a miracle then any coincidence can be turned into a miracle.\nAfter one month there was a very great flood, and in front of my mother’s house in the rainy season it was almost like a river. There was a lake, and a small road between the lake and the house, but in the rainy season so much water came that the road was completely like a river, and the lake and the road became merged into one. It was almost oceanic; as far as you could see it was all water. And that year perhaps India had the biggest floods ever.\nFloods ordinarily happen every year in India, but that year a strange thing was noted, that floods started reversing the rivers’ flow of water. The rains were so heavy that the ocean was not able to take the water as quickly as it was coming, so the water at the ocean front was stuck; it started flowing backwards. Where small rivers fall into big rivers, the big rivers refused to take the water, because they were not able even to contain their own water. The small rivers started moving backwards.\nI have never seen it – that one also I missed – but my mother says that it was a strange phenomenon to see the water moving backwards. And it started entering houses; it entered my mother’s house. It was a double-storied house, and the first story was completely full of water. Then it started entering the second story. Now, there was nowhere to go, so they were all sitting on the beds, the highest place that was possible there. But my mother said, “If Sai Baba was right, then something will happen.” And it must have been a coincidence that the water came up to my mother’s stomach and then receded!\nThese two miracles happened before I was born, so I have nothing to do with them. But they became known; when I was born I was almost a saint in the village! Everybody was so respectful; people were touching my feet, even old people. I was told later on that “the whole village has accepted you as a saint.”\nWhen I must have been nearabout four I was the only child in the house – nothing to do, no school, no place to go. My maternal grandfather had a multipurpose shop, of all kinds of things. That was the only shop in the village so every kind of thing... a very miniature market it was rather than a shop. So I started playing with sweets and things, and I don’t know how it occurred to me... but soon people were continually coming who were sick; and there was no doctor, no physician, no hospital, even for hundreds of miles, no hospital.\nSomehow it came to me that if people think of me as a saint, and they touch my feet, I would start giving them medicines. And the medicines were nothing but mixtures of a few sweets, ground well, powdered, and kept in bottles of different colors. And of course, people who get fever or headache or a stomachache don’t die. And they started getting cured. They were going to be cured anyway – that was not a miracle, but it became a miracle.\nMy nana, my maternal grandfather, started saying, “You will spoil my shop – now it is a hospital! The whole day people are coming and sometimes I even have to give your medicines, and I have no idea what those medicines are! You are destroying my sweets and my shop. But they are getting cured, so no harm, you continue.”\nWhen I moved after seven years to my father’s house I dropped that business of giving medicines, but people from that village, whenever they used to come, would remind me. They had already started calling me Doctor Sahib, and I would say, “Please don’t use that word here, because I have stopped that profession completely. In the first place there are no sweets here; my father has a shop of cloth, I cannot make medicines out of cloth. And here nobody knows that I can do miracles. First people have to know, then you can do them; otherwise you cannot.”\nCoincidences perhaps may have happened in the lives of Buddha, Jesus, Krishna, but it would have been far more honest of them to say that these were coincidences, that nature had not broken its law, it had not given a special power to somebody. But they remained silent about it. Silence is a support. Perhaps there was not any bad intention, because it has been noted that people are not in search of truth but in search of power – and the miracle is a symbol of power, not of truth. Truth has nothing to do with miracles\nBut who is interested in truth? Everybody is interested in power.\nSo when you see a man of miracles you are immediately impressed: here is a man who has power. And that is your deepest urge – the will-to-power. Then you start following this man. In fact, if somebody tries to explain to you that these are not miracles you don’t want to listen because he is taking away your power; your only hope he is destroying.\nSo the people who believe in miracle-men are not ready to listen for the simple reason that you may destroy their faith, their belief You may be able to prove that either it is magic – that means just conjuring tricks – or it is simply a coincidence, or it is just an invented story. And many things can be managed very easily.…\nI used to know in Jabalpur a man from south India. He must have come some thirty, forty years before from Madras, and he had lived in Jabalpur for forty years; still he was known as Madrasi Baba because he was from Madras. It was known that he had revived dead people. I was a student in the university; I heard this many times so I collected a few people and one night we went to Madrasi Baba. He used to live in a small hut outside the town, so it was very easy.\nWe all entered his hut, and we took hold of him – he was lying down on his cot. We tied his feet and hands, and I told him, “You have to tell the truth – we are not going to tell anybody, but if you don’t tell us the truth then today we are going to do a miracle.”\nHe said, “What kind of miracle?”\nI said, “Today we are going to turn an alive man into a dead man. Just in front of your house there is a big lake; we are going to throw you into it. And we will make every certainty and surety that you cannot survive. We have big rocks outside which we are going to put on your chest, bind with your cot and throw the whole cot with you and the rocks. And you will go down – unless you tell us how you managed to revive a man.”\nHe said, “I will tell you but please don’t tell anybody; otherwise my whole life will be ruined. I live only on that miracle.”\nI said, “First tell us.” And what miracles had he done? It was one of his friends who pretended to be dead. He was a practitioner of yoga, they both were practitioners of yoga. If you practice yoga then there is a possibility that for at least ten minutes you can stop your breathing.\nWith certain exercises it is possible that your heart goes on at the minimum, the pulse at the minimum, and your breathing completely stops – but for not more than ten minutes. But ten minutes are enough to prove a man dead, you don’t need more.\nOne morning he declared that his friend had died. People came, they looked, they took his pulse; it was gone. There was no breathing, his heart was not beating – he was dead. They covered him, and then Madrasi Baba chanted some mantras in Telugu, in his language, so nobody knew whether he was chanting mantras or singing film songs. And after seven rounds of chanting and throwing some invisible power over the man he took off the cover, put his hands on the nose of the man, looked upwards – and slowly slowly, the breathing came back, the pulse came back and the heart started beating.\nThe man is still alive, the other man. And we confirmed the story through this other man also, in the same way; we had to because there was no other way. We said that Madrasi Baba himself had told the whole story, “but now you are also in the same situation. So you just tell us, otherwise you will go; we will perform the real miracle.”\nAnd he said, “It is true, I conspired with him – we are partners. Whatsoever money he gets, half he gives to me. For these forty years life has been very pleasant, without any work, without any trouble; we have lived comfortably, and people respect us. Now I am his disciple in people’s eyes, but really I am a partner in his business.” So either miracles are invented.…\nNow, nobody can say this Lazarus was not a partner in the whole conspiracy. He was a friend of Jesus’ – that much is reported. And why only Lazarus? There were so many people dying. Did he have to wait to do the miracle only when Lazarus died? And Lazarus was young – it was not his time to die either. He was Jesus’ friend so there is every possibility that Jesus may have told him, “Just pretend you are dead.” He had learned all yoga practices in India, in Egypt; both countries know the secrets about stopping the breath.\nEither it is a coincidence, or it is a conspiracy, or it is just a myth created when the person is gone. But you can judge very easily.\nJesus can revive a dead man, but when he is feeling thirsty on the cross he cannot materialize a single glass of water, or just a Coca-Cola. That would have been a real miracle – if he had produced Coca-Cola. Then I would never say that miracles don’t exist, because to produce Coca-Cola at that time would not have been possible. Even today you cannot make it, because the secret of Coca- Cola is absolutely preserved, there is no wayThere are so many cold drinks available in the world,\nbut nothing comes close to Coca-Cola.\nIf Jesus had produced that, with the label of Coca-cola and the bottle and everything, then there would have been no need for any other proof; they could have just preserved the Coca-Cola bottle in the Vatican.\nBut whatever he did is not of much significance, and he could not do it when he was himself in need. He could revive the dead but he could not change those apostles, transform their beings.\nWhat to say of transformation – even on the last night when Jesus is to depart he says to them again and again, “Remain awake, don’t fall asleep! This is my last night; tonight they are going to catch me. Remain awake so that I can pray silently – and be watchful!”\nAnd after each hour he comes and he finds his disciples are fast asleep, snoring. He wakes them up and tells them again, “Have you forgotten?”\nNow, with these stupid people Jesus wasted his whole life – people who were not even capable of remaining awake just one night. When the master is going to be crucified the next day, even out of curiosity one would have remained awake; but even curiosity is not there. The moment Jesus goes back behind the bushes to prayand why does he go behind the bushes? That I don’t understand.\nYou can go behind the bushes to piss, not to pray, but it would stink.\nHe should have remained just in the middle of those fools and prayed there; that would have kept them awake at least. But going behind the bushesAgain and again, the whole night that drama\ncontinues, but they are not ready. You can’t change people’s minds just a little bit but you can raise people from the dead? It doesn’t seem to be possible.\nThere are miracles around Buddha – that when he passes, trees blossom out of season. The whole forest might be dry if the season was fall and all the leaves had fallen, but if Buddha passes through the forest it looks disrespectful – those barren trees without leaves, without flowers. No, suddenly the whole forest changes its course of millions of years; suddenly there are leaves, suddenly there is greenery, flowers, fruits.\nI can say this must be a myth because Buddha himself has a personal physician continuously moving with him, his Devaraj. For what? If even trees understand, I won’t his body understand? The most famous physician of those days, Jivakar, was continuously with him, just like a shadow, taking care of his body – and still he died of food poisoning. Not a great way to die, through food poisoning.\nIf some glutton dies of food poisoning he can be forgiven, but not Buddha. The poison had no consideration for Buddha, the food had no consideration, the body had no consideration – and the trees and the forest and the mountains had consideration for him?\nHe was sitting in meditation, and his brother, his own brother, Devadatta, who was a follower... but he wanted Buddha to declare him his successor. Buddha said, “That is not possible. You are not yet capable of such a position. And there are people – Mahakassapa, Sariputta, Moggalayan – so many people who are already enlightened. How can I declare you, an unenlightened person, as my successor? I am not going to declare anybody my successor because there are so many people who are capable of being my successor – how am I to choose?”\nBut Devadatta was very angry, so angry that he left Buddha, taking five thousand disciples of Buddha with him. And he tried many ways to kill Buddha. One was that while Buddha was meditating, sitting on a rock Devadatta slid a big rock from the mountain top aimed exactly to hit Buddha.\nAnd it would have simply crushed him – there was no chance – but the rock, just on the way, thought, “There is Buddha, and this would not be right, to go on falling in the traditional way.” It moved, changed its course – which was very strange because there was no reason for it to change its course, no obstacle that moved it from its course.\nDevadatta brought a mad elephant who was known to have killed many people and so was kept always in chains. He brought him and left him without chains close to where Buddha was sitting. And the elephant came rushing, because after many days he had got the chance to kill somebody. He was murderous. But just coming close to Buddha, a sudden break: no, this is not the man to kill. He lowered himself, went on his knees and touched Buddha’s feet.\nNow if elephants, mad elephants, rocks and trees are so careful about Buddha – and I would like them to be so careful, there is no harm in it. I would like them to be so careful about everybody, why only about Buddha? But when he eats the poisonous food his own body does not bother; the poison takes no care. That proves that all other stories are beautiful stories created to make Buddha a superhuman being.\nThe same is true about all your miracle-men. As far as I am concerned, a miracle is something against nature, against existence; hence it is impossible. Yes, your mind wants it because your mind is sick. It is hungry for power and it would like its master to be a man of power. Then of course you can hope that some day you can manage – by serving the master, by trusting the master, by surrendering to the master – you can get some power yourself.\nIt is a deep desire for power that goes on asking again and again whether miracles happen or not.\nI say categorically they have never happened, because in the very nature of things a miracle is an absurdity. It simply means suddenly nature forgets its laws, existence changes its course. No, existence is fair, it is equal to all, exactly the same to all. And it is good that it is fair and equal; otherwise there would be the same bureaucracy and hierarchy that goes on in governments.\nAnd that’s what religions have been trying to create. What is this Christianity? A certain kind of bureaucracy from God, the Holy Ghost, Jesus, the messiah; then the pope, his representative; then the cardinal, then the bishop, and so on and so on.It goes on and on to the lowest priest in the\nvillage.\nThis is a hierarchy, a bureaucracy. But everything is based on the miracles of Jesus. That’s why I want to hammer those miracles as forcibly as possible. If they are broken completely the whole\nhierarchy and bureaucracy falls down; they have nothing else to support them. And the same is true about all religions\nI know only of one miracle which is not included in your question about miracles; and that miracle is a jump of consciousness between the Master and the disciple.\nSomething transpires, but it is not done by the Master, it is not done by the disciple. Both are surprised when it happens.\nThe Master is available.\nWhenever the disciple is also available, it simply happens. This is the only miracle I know of\nBut it is not to be categorized with other miracles because it is really the ultimate law of existence. It is not something against existence, it is something which is the deepest, most central, most fundamental part of existence itself.\nJust look for this miracle, wait for this miracle, and forget all nonsense about everything else.\nIf you really want to be religious, if you really want to be transformed, then you have to destroy all barriers between you and the transformation you are searching.\nYes, that miracle is possible. That miracle is possible any moment – here, now. So prepare for that. Don’t go on digging in bullshit.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7061","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/from_misery_to_enlightenment/part14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/from_misery_to_enlightenment/>From Misery to Enlightenment</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">14 Don\'t walk on water \-- jump into consciousness</h1><div class=post-meta>34 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7061 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/From_Misery_to_Enlightenment/part14.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

religions down the centuries. I cannot do it because that consolation
has cost too much. It has not given anything; on the contrary, it has
taken away your very religiousness.</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot say anything that in the short-term may seem to help your
growth towards religion, but in the long-term is simply poison. That’s
what the idea of a miracle is.</p><p><br></p><p>The human mind is begging for it. It is the need of a sick mind – but
all minds are sick. Mind as such is the sickness of man.</p><p>When the mind disappears you are, for the first time, really healthy
and whole. Mind needs all kinds of poisons to continue to exist. The
idea of miracles is one of the most important. The idea is absolutely
against existence.</p><p><br></p><p>First you have to understand, what does a miracle mean? It means that
existence is not trustable, that nature is not unprejudiced, that the
laws of life allow exceptions. This is an absolute absurdity.</p><p>Existence has no prejudices – that for Jesus it has a soft corner in
the heart, and not for you; that it allows Mohammed to go beyond natural
laws, but it does not allow you. A miracle simply is a condemnation of
the fairness of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>No, there is no such thing as a miracle – never has been, never will
be. If miracles happen then science cannot happen; and we know that
science has happened. And as science has grown, miracles have diminished
in exact proportion. The more science grows, the less and less are there
miracles. If you go farther back you can find thousands of miracles
happening.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of those miracles are just stories invented to create messiahs,
prophets, reincarnations of God – because how can you manage to put a
certain man above all humanity? How can you manage to make him
superhuman? His body follows nature, his life follows nature. From birth
to death there is not a single exception.</p><p><br></p><p>But the fools around the world will not accept an ordinary man as
enlightened. They need a superman, only then is their mind satisfied: Of
course, he is a superman, a messenger of God; he can be enlightened –
but how can we poor human beings be enlightened?</p><p><br></p><p>And how to prove that he is superior to you? Just look: Jesus is not
superior as far as intelligence is concerned, shows no special
intelligence. There were hundreds of more learned rabbis, great scholars
of profound intelligence; he is just an uneducated, unpolished
carpenter’s son.</p><p><br></p><p>By intelligence he cannot prove – nor can his followers – that he is
superior, that he is special, that he is the only begotten son of God.
By physical strength he cannot prove that either. Any Muhammad Ali will
throw him flat. Just by a single hit on his nose he is finished.
Physically he cannot prove that he is superior.</p><p><br></p><p>Now these are the only two things in human life where you find.<span class=s4></span>Somebody is an Albert Einstein,</p><p>a Bertrand Russell, a Jean-Paul Sartre – they have proved
intellectually they are sharper, more talented. But a strange thing is,
they don’t claim they are the only begotten son of God. No intelligent
person can claim such an unintelligent thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Or there are people who are physically talented. They may come first
in the Olympic race, in some game, in some wrestling, but that simply
shows a difference between you and them of quantity, not of quality.
Howsoever powerful a man may be, he is only quantitatively different
from you; and the difference of quantity is no difference at all.</p><p><br></p><p>If you had worked on the same lines with the same gymnastics for the
same time, perhaps you might have proved even a better wrestler, a
better runner. All that is proved is that this man has practiced a
certain talent. Certainly he should be respected – but he does not
become the messenger of God.</p><p><br></p><p>There are people who are world champions in chess playing. Certainly
they have a tremendously complicated mind. A real chess player has to
think five moves ahead. When you play chess you only think of one move
ahead, at the most two moves; more than that and you will get
puzzled.</p><p><br></p><p>Five is the minimum to become a world champion. Five moves means you
take one move, the other person will take a move. You have to visualize
what he is going to take, then what you will do, then</p><p>what he will do, then what you will do – five times. You have to be
clear about five moves ahead, only then can you be a world champion;
otherwise it is impossible. That much concentration, practice... it is a
maddening thing.</p><p><br></p><p>But even then, somebody becoming a world champion in chess is not a
prophet. He has a mind closer to a computer than you have. Your mind is
simpler, a little more primitive a computer; his mind is a little more
sophisticated a computer. Your mind can be trained also in the same way.
It is only a question of training. The difference is only of degrees,
there is no difference of quality. He is just as human a being as you
are.</p><p><br></p><p>Then how to prove that Jesus, Mohammed, Mahavira, Buddha, Krishna –
that these people are not just ordinary like you? The way that has been
discovered is called the miracle. That makes them qualitatively
different from you, because whatsoever you do, you cannot get trained in
walking on water. Whatever you do you will be drowned again and again.
So it is not a question of training, discipline, knowing certain
strategies – no, nothing will help. How can you turn stones into bread?
How can you turn water into wine?</p><p><br></p><p>These stories are invented for a certain purpose – to make that man
qualitatively higher than you. But this is exploiting humanity,
corrupting human consciousness, giving people false ideas.</p><p><br></p><p>Just look at these miracle-men of the world and you can see that of
all those miracles, ninety percent were invented by the followers or by
the originators themselves. It is difficult at such a long distance to
know who started them. Most of them must have been started by the
originators themselves, and of course followers go on adding to
them.</p><p><br></p><p>It becomes an absolute necessity for followers to go on adding more
and more miracles, because it is a competitive business and everybody
has to prove his messiah the highest, the greatest. Everybody else is
below him. Now, only miracles can do that miracle, there is no other
way.</p><p><br></p><p>Jainas have twenty-four tirthankaras, twenty-four messiahs. Because
Jainas had twenty-four, Buddhists were at a loss; they had only one –
Gautam Buddha. In the market – and this whole world is a market and
every human being is a customer – when you are selling your messiah,
your religion, your holy book, small things count. A Buddhist feels at a
loss because people ask how many buddhas there have been. lust one?
Looks very poor – Jainas have twenty-four!</p><p><br></p><p>Hindus up to that moment had ten incarnations of God. They
immediately changed to twenty- four because ten looked poor before
twenty-four. The idea of Jainas having twenty-four<span class=s4></span>Before</p><p>Mahavira, all Hindu scriptures talk of ten avataras; after Mahavira
suddenly a great change happens – Hindus start talking about
twenty-four.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddhists are at a loss because their religion starts with Buddha, so
where to put twenty-four buddhas? But they have to be a little more
creative. They started talking about twenty-four lives of Gautam Buddha
– this was the twenty-fourth life. He had been an awakened one
twenty-three times before.</p><p><br></p><p>You can see a clever legal process. They had no historical grounds to
prove that there had been twenty-four buddhas. Even Buddha cannot say
that because he was the originator. But this was easy, to invent
twenty-three previous lives.</p><p>The span is thousands of years, and in those days particularly in
India history was not written. History was not even counted as a
subject. Writing history was introduced by the Mohammedans in India. In
India the idea was that history consists of mundane, ordinary, day to
day things, which go on being repeated. A king is born, a king dies;
another king will be there, he will die. Empires are built and
disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>If you look at the millions of years in India it has been the custom
to look at existence extending for millions and millions of years – what
does it matter that a man was a prime minister for three months in a
country? Why bother? For three months out of millions and millions of
years, in a country on a very mediocre planet, of a very mediocre solar
system, a certain man was prime minister – why bother? The Indian
attitude is, why unnecessarily waste time?</p><p><br></p><p>So instead of history... the Indian word for history is very
significant. It is itihas. The word means “that which comes and
disappears like a soap bubble” the end is not very far from the
beginning. So instead they used to write puranas. Now, the word puranas
means something not concerned with individuals but with essentials.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, a tirthankara is not just a person. There are only
twenty-four tirthankaras in one creation, and one creation means
millions and millions of years. Each tirthankara simply represents the
essence of consciousness touching the highest peak. In millions of years
only twenty-four times has human consciousness risen so high that it
touches the ultimate.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this is essential. When Mahavira was born and when he died –
that is history – doesn’t matter; any date will do. What difference does
it make whether he was born twenty-five centuries ago or twenty-six
centuries ago, on Monday, on Sunday, on Saturday – what does it matter?
What matters is that a consciousness reached a peak.</p><p><br></p><p>If you go in a Jaina temple you will be surprised to see twenty-four
tirthankaras all looking exactly alike. This is impossible, that all
these twenty-four persons – and they were born over a long period of
thousands of years – looked absolutely alike. Their noses, their eyes,
even their ear lobes... because a Jaina tirthankara’s ear lobes have to
be so long that they touch the shoulder – on all twenty-four
tirthankaras.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot say whose statue this is – even Jainas cannot say whose
statue this is. So they had to make, near the feet, a symbol: a lion
represents Mahavira, a peacock represents somebody else.… So if you ask
a Jaina he will just immediately look at the symbol near the feet. Only
by the symbol can he say who this is; otherwise they are all alike.</p><p><br></p><p>It certainly is not history. No two persons are ever born exactly
alike; to find twenty-four people exactly alike is impossible. But they
are not concerned with those persons – their bodies, their noses, their
ears – their concern is with their consciousness; and everything else is
representing symbolically the highest peak of consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, the ear lobes touching the shoulders<span class=s4></span>Perhaps once in a while you may find a person</p><p>whose ear lobes do touch, but I have never seen one. I have seen
millions of people and I have looked at their ears, but I have never
seen a single person whose ear lobes touched the shoulders. Just one
person I know – he was a colleague of mine in my high-school classes –
who had special kind of ears.</p><p>He could move them according to his will and wish. You cannot do it.
You don’t have muscles, you cannot do anything with your ears. Just try
to do something; you cannot do anything. But this boy was a miracle! He
could turn his ears down, up, move them in and out.</p><p><br></p><p>He is now a doctor, but more famous for his ears than anything else.
Patients will come and ask, “Doctor, please, just show your ears.” I
have been searching for a second person who can do that even better – I
have not found one. Some freak of nature<span class=s4></span>It seems
he has some muscles and</p><p>nerves in his ears which are not needed, so he can pull his ears and
do things with them.</p><p><br></p><p>But what were these tirthankaras doing with ears that long? One
thing, it is not history, so it is not representative of reality; it is
representative of something different. To me those long ears simply mean
that these people were capable of listening. Now, how do you represent
in a marble statue that they were totally capable of listening? Now, to
represent that, they don’t care about history; it is puranas. Puranas
means we are concerned about the essentials.</p><p><br></p><p>All these twenty-four statues have their eyes half-closed. You can
see only the lower white part of the eyes; otherwise the eyes are
closed. But why half? That is the only difference you will find in a
Buddhist statue and a Jaina statue: the Buddha’s statue has the eyes
completely closed.</p><p><br></p><p>Again, it is not history. They are not saying anything about these
people; they are saying that a man who touches the highest consciousness
is so complete that the outer and the inner become one. His half-closed
eyes symbolize that the outer half and the inner half are meeting. This
is what I mean by essence.</p><p><br></p><p>Mahavira had twenty-three predecessors – Buddha was in a difficulty.
And there were so many miracles about those twenty-three predecessors of
Mahavira that Buddha looked poor. So first he had to create the idea
that he had been a buddha twenty-three times before; and then about
those twenty-three buddhas he created miracles. Perhaps the miracles
about him are created by his disciples later on, but he must have
initiated them in some way.</p><p><br></p><p>At least one thing is certain, that none of these fellows prevented
their disciples by saying, “Don’t do this mischief to me.” Even if they
had not created the miracles themselves they allowed them by remaining
silent. If the rumors were going around that they were doing miracles or
miracles were happening, there is not a single statement from Krishna,
Buddha, Jesus, Mahavira, Mohammed, which says no, these were rumors.</p><p><br></p><p>My mother was just telling me yesterday<span class=s4></span>and
Vivek listened to her talking so animatedly for the</p><p>first time in so long; otherwise whatever she has to ask is answered
in one or two sentences; yes or no, and the conversation is over. But
yesterday she was talking for a long time and she was very animated, so
Vivek asked me, “What was your mother telling you?”</p><p><br></p><p>I told her she was remembering a few things. I have not told her yet
what she was telling me, because it was a long story. She was telling me
that when I was five months old in her womb, a miracle happened.</p><p><br></p><p>She was going from my father’s house to her father’s house; and it
was the rainy season. It is customary in India for the first child to be
born at the maternal father’s home, so although it was the</p><p>rainy season and very difficult – no roads, and she had to go on a
horse – the sooner she went, the better; if she waited longer then it
would have become more difficult, so she went with one of her
cousin-brothers.</p><p><br></p><p>In the middle of the journey was a big river, the Narmada. It was in
flood. When they reached the boat, the boatman saw that my mother was
pregnant, and he asked my mother’s cousin-brother, “What is your
relationship?”</p><p><br></p><p>He was not aware that he would get into trouble so he simply said,
“We are brother and sister.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boatman refused; he said, “I cannot take you because your sister
is pregnant – that means you are not two, you are three.”</p><p><br></p><p>In India, this is a custom, an old custom – perhaps it started in the
days of Krishna – that one should not travel on water, particularly in a
boat, with one’s sister’s son. There is a danger of the boat
sinking.</p><p><br></p><p>The boatman said, “What guarantee is there that the child in your
sister’s womb is a girl and not a boy? If he is a boy I don’t want to
take the risk – because it is not a question only of my life, sixty
other people are going in the boat. Either you can come or your sister
can come; both I won’t take.”</p><p><br></p><p>On both sides there were hills and jungle, and the boat used to go
only one time a day. In the morning it would go – and the river is
really vast at that point – and then it would come back by the evening.
The next morning it would go again, the same boat. So either my mother
had to remain on this side, which was dangerous, or go on that side,
which was just as dangerous. So for three days they continued to ask
him, beg him, saying that she was pregnant and he should be kind.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I can’t help it – this is not done. If you can give me a
guarantee that it is not a boy then I can take you; but how can you give
me a guarantee?”</p><p><br></p><p>So for three days they had to stay in a temple there. In that temple
lived a saint, very famous in those days in that area. Now, around that
temple there has arisen a city in the memory of that saint, Saikheda.
Saikheda means “the village of the saint.” Sai means the saint; he was
known as Sai Baba. It is not the same Sai Baba who became world-famous –
Sai Baba of Shirdi – but they were contemporaries.</p><p><br></p><p>Sai Baba of Shirdi became world-famous because of the simple
coincidence that Shirdi is near Bombay, and all the celebrities of
Bombay and the rich people of Bombay started going to Sai Baba of
Shirdi. And the richer you are, the more famous you are, the more
successful you are, the more you are in need of something to give you
fulfillment, because all your success, your riches, your fame has
brought you nothing. These are the emptiest people in the world, the
hollowest. And because of Bombay being a world center, soon Sai Baba of
Shirdi’s name started reaching outside India, and so many miracles were
created around him.</p><p><br></p><p>The same was the situation with this Sai Baba who lived in that
temple. Finally my mother had to ask Sai Baba, “Can you do something?
For three days we have been here. I am pregnant and my brother has told
the boatman that he is my brother, and he won’t take us in the boat.
Now, unless</p><p>you do something, say something to that boatman, we are in a fix.
What to do? My brother cannot leave me here alone; I cannot go alone to
the other side. On both sides are wild jungles and forests, and for at
least twenty-four hours I will have to wait alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>I never met Sai Baba, but in a way I did meet him; I was five months
old. He just touched my mother’s belly. My mother said, “What are your
doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am touching the feet of your child.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boatman saw this and said, “What are you doing, Baba? You have
never touched anybody’s feet.”</p><p><br></p><p>And Baba said, “This is not anybody; and you are a fool – you should
take them to the other side. Don’t be worried. The soul that is within
this womb is capable of saving thousands of people, so don’t be worried
about your sixty people – take her.”</p><p><br></p><p>So my mother was saying, “At that time I became aware that I was
carrying someone special.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “As far as I understand, Sai Baba was a wise man: he really
befooled the boatman! There is no miracle, there is nothing. And boats
don’t sink just because somebody is traveling with their sister’s son.
There is no rationality in the idea, it is just absurd. Perhaps sometime
accidentally it may have happened and then it became a routine
idea.”</p><p><br></p><p>My own understanding is that because in Krishna’s life his mother’s
brother was told by the astrologers that “one of the children of your
sister will kill YOU,” he kept his sister and his brother- in-law in
prison. She gave birth to seven children, seven boys, and he killed them
all. The eighth was Krishna, and of course when God Himself was born,
the locks of the prison opened up, and the guards fell fast asleep, and
Krishna’s father took him out.</p><p><br></p><p>The river Yamuna was the boundary of Kansa’s kingdom. Kansa was the
person who was killing his sister’s sons in the fear that one of the
sons was going to kill him. The Yamuna was in flood – and it is one of
the biggest rivers in India. The father of Krishna was very much afraid,
but somehow the child had to be taken to the other side, to a friend’s
house whose wife had given birth to a girl so he could exchange them. He
could bring the girl back with him because the next morning Kansa would
be there asking, “Where is the child?” and planning to kill him. A girl
he wouldn’t kill – it had to be a boy.</p><p><br></p><p>But how to cross this river? There was no boat in the night, but it
had to be crossed. But when God can open locks without keys, without
anybody opening them – they simply opened up, the doors opened up, the
guards fell asleep – God would do something.</p><p><br></p><p>So he put the child in a bucket on his head and passed through the
river – something like what happened to Moses when the ocean parted.
This time it happened in an Indian way. It could not have happened to
Moses because that ocean was not Indian, but this river was.</p><p><br></p><p>As he entered the river, the river started rising higher. He was very
much afraid: what was happening? He was hoping the river would subside,
but it started rising. It went to the point where</p><p>it touched the feet of Krishna, then it receded. This is the Indian
way, it cannot happen anywhere else. How can the river miss such a
point? When God is born and passing through her, just giving way is not
enough, not mannerly.</p><p><br></p><p>Since that time there has been this idea that there is a certain
antagonism between a person and his sister’s son, because Krishna killed
Kansa. The river was crossed, it subsided; it favored the child. Since
then rivers are angry against maternal uncles – all the rivers of India.
And that superstition is carried even today.</p><p><br></p><p>I told my mother, “One thing is certain – that Sai Baba must have
been a wise man and had some sense of humor.” But she wouldn’t listen.
And it became known in the village what had happened, and to support it,
after one month another thing happened which.… In life there are so many
coincidences out of which you can make miracles. Once you are bent upon
making a miracle then any coincidence can be turned into a miracle.</p><p><br></p><p>After one month there was a very great flood, and in front of my
mother’s house in the rainy season it was almost like a river. There was
a lake, and a small road between the lake and the house, but in the
rainy season so much water came that the road was completely like a
river, and the lake and the road became merged into one. It was almost
oceanic; as far as you could see it was all water. And that year perhaps
India had the biggest floods ever.</p><p><br></p><p>Floods ordinarily happen every year in India, but that year a strange
thing was noted, that floods started reversing the rivers’ flow of
water. The rains were so heavy that the ocean was not able to take the
water as quickly as it was coming, so the water at the ocean front was
stuck; it started flowing backwards. Where small rivers fall into big
rivers, the big rivers refused to take the water, because they were not
able even to contain their own water. The small rivers started moving
backwards.</p><p><br></p><p>I have never seen it – that one also I missed – but my mother says
that it was a strange phenomenon to see the water moving backwards. And
it started entering houses; it entered my mother’s house. It was a
double-storied house, and the first story was completely full of water.
Then it started entering the second story. Now, there was nowhere to go,
so they were all sitting on the beds, the highest place that was
possible there. But my mother said, “If Sai Baba was right, then
something will happen.” And it must have been a coincidence that the
water came up to my mother’s stomach and then receded!</p><p><br></p><p>These two miracles happened before I was born, so I have nothing to
do with them. But they became known; when I was born I was almost a
saint in the village! Everybody was so respectful; people were touching
my feet, even old people. I was told later on that “the whole village
has accepted you as a saint.”</p><p><br></p><p>When I must have been nearabout four I was the only child in the
house – nothing to do, no school, no place to go. My maternal
grandfather had a multipurpose shop, of all kinds of things. That was
the only shop in the village so every kind of thing... a very miniature
market it was rather than a shop. So I started playing with sweets and
things, and I don’t know how it occurred to me... but soon people were
continually coming who were sick; and there was no doctor, no physician,
no hospital, even for hundreds of miles, no hospital.</p><p>Somehow it came to me that if people think of me as a saint, and they
touch my feet, I would start giving them medicines. And the medicines
were nothing but mixtures of a few sweets, ground well, powdered, and
kept in bottles of different colors. And of course, people who get fever
or headache or a stomachache don’t die. And they started getting cured.
They were going to be cured anyway – that was not a miracle, but it
became a miracle.</p><p><br></p><p>My nana, my maternal grandfather, started saying, “You will spoil my
shop – now it is a hospital! The whole day people are coming and
sometimes I even have to give your medicines, and I have no idea what
those medicines are! You are destroying my sweets and my shop. But they
are getting cured, so no harm, you continue.”</p><p><br></p><p>When I moved after seven years to my father’s house I dropped that
business of giving medicines, but people from that village, whenever
they used to come, would remind me. They had already started calling me
Doctor Sahib, and I would say, “Please don’t use that word here, because
I have stopped that profession completely. In the first place there are
no sweets here; my father has a shop of cloth, I cannot make medicines
out of cloth. And here nobody knows that I can do miracles. First people
have to know, then you can do them; otherwise you cannot.”</p><p><br></p><p>Coincidences perhaps may have happened in the lives of Buddha, Jesus,
Krishna, but it would have been far more honest of them to say that
these were coincidences, that nature had not broken its law, it had not
given a special power to somebody. But they remained silent about it.
Silence is a support. Perhaps there was not any bad intention, because
it has been noted that people are not in search of truth but in search
of power – and the miracle is a symbol of power, not of truth. Truth has
nothing to do with miracles</p><p><br></p><p>But who is interested in truth? Everybody is interested in power.</p><p>So when you see a man of miracles you are immediately impressed: here
is a man who has power. And that is your deepest urge – the
will-to-power. Then you start following this man. In fact, if somebody
tries to explain to you that these are not miracles you don’t want to
listen because he is taking away your power; your only hope he is
destroying.</p><p><br></p><p>So the people who believe in miracle-men are not ready to listen for
the simple reason that you may destroy their faith, their belief You may
be able to prove that either it is magic – that means just conjuring
tricks – or it is simply a coincidence, or it is just an invented story.
And many things can be managed very easily.…</p><p><br></p><p>I used to know in Jabalpur a man from south India. He must have come
some thirty, forty years before from Madras, and he had lived in
Jabalpur for forty years; still he was known as Madrasi Baba because he
was from Madras. It was known that he had revived dead people. I was a
student in the university; I heard this many times so I collected a few
people and one night we went to Madrasi Baba. He used to live in a small
hut outside the town, so it was very easy.</p><p><br></p><p>We all entered his hut, and we took hold of him – he was lying down
on his cot. We tied his feet and hands, and I told him, “You have to
tell the truth – we are not going to tell anybody, but if you don’t tell
us the truth then today we are going to do a miracle.”</p><p>He said, “What kind of miracle?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Today we are going to turn an alive man into a dead man.
Just in front of your house there is a big lake; we are going to throw
you into it. And we will make every certainty and surety that you cannot
survive. We have big rocks outside which we are going to put on your
chest, bind with your cot and throw the whole cot with you and the
rocks. And you will go down – unless you tell us how you managed to
revive a man.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I will tell you but please don’t tell anybody; otherwise my
whole life will be ruined. I live only on that miracle.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “First tell us.” And what miracles had he done? It was one of
his friends who pretended to be dead. He was a practitioner of yoga,
they both were practitioners of yoga. If you practice yoga then there is
a possibility that for at least ten minutes you can stop your
breathing.</p><p><br></p><p>With certain exercises it is possible that your heart goes on at the
minimum, the pulse at the minimum, and your breathing completely stops –
but for not more than ten minutes. But ten minutes are enough to prove a
man dead, you don’t need more.</p><p><br></p><p>One morning he declared that his friend had died. People came, they
looked, they took his pulse; it was gone. There was no breathing, his
heart was not beating – he was dead. They covered him, and then Madrasi
Baba chanted some mantras in Telugu, in his language, so nobody knew
whether he was chanting mantras or singing film songs. And after seven
rounds of chanting and throwing some invisible power over the man he
took off the cover, put his hands on the nose of the man, looked upwards
– and slowly slowly, the breathing came back, the pulse came back and
the heart started beating.</p><p><br></p><p>The man is still alive, the other man. And we confirmed the story
through this other man also, in the same way; we had to because there
was no other way. We said that Madrasi Baba himself had told the whole
story, “but now you are also in the same situation. So you just tell us,
otherwise you will go; we will perform the real miracle.”</p><p><br></p><p>And he said, “It is true, I conspired with him – we are partners.
Whatsoever money he gets, half he gives to me. For these forty years
life has been very pleasant, without any work, without any trouble; we
have lived comfortably, and people respect us. Now I am his disciple in
people’s eyes, but really I am a partner in his business.” So either
miracles are invented.…</p><p><br></p><p>Now, nobody can say this Lazarus was not a partner in the whole
conspiracy. He was a friend of Jesus’ – that much is reported. And why
only Lazarus? There were so many people dying. Did he have to wait to do
the miracle only when Lazarus died? And Lazarus was young – it was not
his time to die either. He was Jesus’ friend so there is every
possibility that Jesus may have told him, “Just pretend you are dead.”
He had learned all yoga practices in India, in Egypt; both countries
know the secrets about stopping the breath.</p><p><br></p><p>Either it is a coincidence, or it is a conspiracy, or it is just a
myth created when the person is gone. But you can judge very easily.</p><p>Jesus can revive a dead man, but when he is feeling thirsty on the
cross he cannot materialize a single glass of water, or just a
Coca-Cola. That would have been a real miracle – if he had produced
Coca-Cola. Then I would never say that miracles don’t exist, because to
produce Coca-Cola at that time would not have been possible. Even today
you cannot make it, because the secret of Coca- Cola is absolutely
preserved, there is no way<span class=s4></span>There are so many cold
drinks available in the world,</p><p>but nothing comes close to Coca-Cola.</p><p><br></p><p>If Jesus had produced that, with the label of Coca-cola and the
bottle and everything, then there would have been no need for any other
proof; they could have just preserved the Coca-Cola bottle in the
Vatican.</p><p><br></p><p>But whatever he did is not of much significance, and he could not do
it when he was himself in need. He could revive the dead but he could
not change those apostles, transform their beings.</p><p><br></p><p>What to say of transformation – even on the last night when Jesus is
to depart he says to them again and again, “Remain awake, don’t fall
asleep! This is my last night; tonight they are going to catch me.
Remain awake so that I can pray silently – and be watchful!”</p><p><br></p><p>And after each hour he comes and he finds his disciples are fast
asleep, snoring. He wakes them up and tells them again, “Have you
forgotten?”</p><p><br></p><p>Now, with these stupid people Jesus wasted his whole life – people
who were not even capable of remaining awake just one night. When the
master is going to be crucified the next day, even out of curiosity one
would have remained awake; but even curiosity is not there. The moment
Jesus goes back behind the bushes to pray<span class=s4></span>and why
does he go behind the bushes? That I don’t understand.</p><p>You can go behind the bushes to piss, not to pray, but it would
stink.</p><p><br></p><p>He should have remained just in the middle of those fools and prayed
there; that would have kept them awake at least. But going behind the
bushes<span class=s4></span>Again and again, the whole night that
drama</p><p>continues, but they are not ready. You can’t change people’s minds
just a little bit but you can raise people from the dead? It doesn’t
seem to be possible.</p><p><br></p><p>There are miracles around Buddha – that when he passes, trees blossom
out of season. The whole forest might be dry if the season was fall and
all the leaves had fallen, but if Buddha passes through the forest it
looks disrespectful – those barren trees without leaves, without
flowers. No, suddenly the whole forest changes its course of millions of
years; suddenly there are leaves, suddenly there is greenery, flowers,
fruits.</p><p><br></p><p>I can say this must be a myth because Buddha himself has a personal
physician continuously moving with him, his Devaraj. For what? If even
trees understand, I won’t his body understand? The most famous physician
of those days, Jivakar, was continuously with him, just like a shadow,
taking care of his body – and still he died of food poisoning. Not a
great way to die, through food poisoning.</p><p><br></p><p>If some glutton dies of food poisoning he can be forgiven, but not
Buddha. The poison had no consideration for Buddha, the food had no
consideration, the body had no consideration – and the trees and the
forest and the mountains had consideration for him?</p><p>He was sitting in meditation, and his brother, his own brother,
Devadatta, who was a follower... but he wanted Buddha to declare him his
successor. Buddha said, “That is not possible. You are not yet capable
of such a position. And there are people – Mahakassapa, Sariputta,
Moggalayan – so many people who are already enlightened. How can I
declare you, an unenlightened person, as my successor? I am not going to
declare anybody my successor because there are so many people who are
capable of being my successor – how am I to choose?”</p><p><br></p><p>But Devadatta was very angry, so angry that he left Buddha, taking
five thousand disciples of Buddha with him. And he tried many ways to
kill Buddha. One was that while Buddha was meditating, sitting on a rock
Devadatta slid a big rock from the mountain top aimed exactly to hit
Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>And it would have simply crushed him – there was no chance – but the
rock, just on the way, thought, “There is Buddha, and this would not be
right, to go on falling in the traditional way.” It moved, changed its
course – which was very strange because there was no reason for it to
change its course, no obstacle that moved it from its course.</p><p><br></p><p>Devadatta brought a mad elephant who was known to have killed many
people and so was kept always in chains. He brought him and left him
without chains close to where Buddha was sitting. And the elephant came
rushing, because after many days he had got the chance to kill somebody.
He was murderous. But just coming close to Buddha, a sudden break: no,
this is not the man to kill. He lowered himself, went on his knees and
touched Buddha’s feet.</p><p><br></p><p>Now if elephants, mad elephants, rocks and trees are so careful about
Buddha – and I would like them to be so careful, there is no harm in it.
I would like them to be so careful about everybody, why only about
Buddha? But when he eats the poisonous food his own body does not
bother; the poison takes no care. That proves that all other stories are
beautiful stories created to make Buddha a superhuman being.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is true about all your miracle-men. As far as I am
concerned, a miracle is something against nature, against existence;
hence it is impossible. Yes, your mind wants it because your mind is
sick. It is hungry for power and it would like its master to be a man of
power. Then of course you can hope that some day you can manage – by
serving the master, by trusting the master, by surrendering to the
master – you can get some power yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a deep desire for power that goes on asking again and again
whether miracles happen or not.</p><p><br></p><p>I say categorically they have never happened, because in the very
nature of things a miracle is an absurdity. It simply means suddenly
nature forgets its laws, existence changes its course. No, existence is
fair, it is equal to all, exactly the same to all. And it is good that
it is fair and equal; otherwise there would be the same bureaucracy and
hierarchy that goes on in governments.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s what religions have been trying to create. What is this
Christianity? A certain kind of bureaucracy from God, the Holy Ghost,
Jesus, the messiah; then the pope, his representative; then the
cardinal, then the bishop, and so on and so on.<span class=s4></span>It goes on and on to the lowest priest in the</p><p>village.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a hierarchy, a bureaucracy. But everything is based on the
miracles of Jesus. That’s why I want to hammer those miracles as
forcibly as possible. If they are broken completely the whole</p><p>hierarchy and bureaucracy falls down; they have nothing else to
support them. And the same is true about all religions</p><p><br></p><p>I know only of one miracle which is not included in your question
about miracles; and that miracle is a jump of consciousness between the
Master and the disciple.</p><p><br></p><p>Something transpires, but it is not done by the Master, it is not
done by the disciple. Both are surprised when it happens.</p><p><br></p><p>The Master is available.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever the disciple is also available, it simply happens. This is
the only miracle I know of</p><p>But it is not to be categorized with other miracles because it is
really the ultimate law of existence. It is not something against
existence, it is something which is the deepest, most central, most
fundamental part of existence itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Just look for this miracle, wait for this miracle, and forget all
nonsense about everything else.</p><p><br></p><p>If you really want to be religious, if you really want to be
transformed, then you have to destroy all barriers between you and the
transformation you are searching.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, that miracle is possible. That miracle is possible any moment –
here, now. So prepare for that. Don’t go on digging in bullshit.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

‌CHAPTER 7
1984 in Lao Tzu House, Rajneeshpuram, USA
Devageet, when you sometimes say “Okay” to Ashu, I misunderstand: I think it is okay to me. That’s why she laughs. But still I say, deep within me there is nothing but laughter. You can anesthetize my body, everything, but not me. That is beyond you.

That’s why she laughs. But still I say, deep within me there is nothing but laughter. You can anesthetize my body, everything, but not me. That is beyond you.\nThat is the case with you too. Your innermost core is beyond all chemicals and chemistry. Now I can hear Devageet giggling. It is good to hear a man giggle. Men almost never giggle. Giggling has become the sole domain of women. Men either laugh or not, but they don’t giggle. Giggling is just in the middle. It is the Golden Mean. It is Tao. Laughter can be violent. Not to laugh is stupid, but giggling is good.\nSee how I can say something significant even about giggling: “Giggling is good.” Don’t worry even if I say something correct, it is just an old habit. I can even talk in my sleep, so it is no trouble to talk like this.\nGudia knows I talk in my sleep but she does not know to whom. Only I know that. Poor Gudia! I am talking to her and she thinks and worries about why I am talking, and to whom. Alas that she is not aware that I am talking to her just like this. Sleep is a natural anesthetic. Life is so hard that one has to go under every night for a few hours at least. And she wonders whether I really sleep or not. I can understand her wondering.\nFor more than a quarter of a century I have not slept. Devaraj, don’t be worried. Ordinary sleep.… I sleep more than anybody else in the whole world: three hours during the day, and seven, eight, nine hours at night – as much as anybody can afford. In all, in toto, I sleep twelve hours per day, but underneath I am awake. I see myself while asleep, and sometimes it is so lonely during the night that I start talking to Gudia. But her difficulties are many. First, when I talk in my sleep I talk in Hindi. I cannot talk in English while asleep.\nI never will, although I could if I wanted to. Sometimes I have tried and succeeded, but the joy was missing.\nYou must be aware that every day I listen to a song of Noorjahan, the famous Urdu singer. Every day before I come in I listen to her again and again. It could even drive you crazy. What do you know of drilling? I know what drilling means. I drill that song into Gudia every day. She has to hear it, there is no way to avoid it. After my work is over I again play the same song. I love my own language... not that it is my language, but it is so beautiful that even if it were not mine I would have learned it.\nThe song that she hears every day, and will have to hear again and again, says: “Whether you remember or not, once there was a trust between us. Once you used to tell me, ‘You are the most beautiful woman in the world.’ Now, I don’t know whether you would recognize me or not. Perhaps you do not remember, but I still remember. I cannot forget the trust, and the words that you uttered to me. You used to say that your love was impeccable. Do you still remember? Perhaps not, but I remember – not in its totality, of course. Time has done much harm.\n“I am a dilapidated palace, but if you look, look minutely, I am still the same. I still remember the trust and your words. That trust that once existed between us, is it still in your memory or not? I don’t know about you but I still remember.”\nWhy do I go on playing the song of Noorjahan? It is a kind of drilling. Not drilling of your teeth, although if you continue drilling long enough it will get to your teeth too, but drilling into her the beauty of a language. I know it will be difficult for her to understand or appreciate it.\nIn my sleep when I speak to Gudia, I again speak in Hindi because I know her unconscious is still not English. She was only in England for a few years. Before that she was in India, and now she is again in India. I have been trying to efface all that lies between these two. Of this later, when the time comes.…\nToday I was going to say something about Jainism. Look at the madness of this man! Yes, I can jump from one peak to another without any bridge between. But you have to tolerate a madman. You have fallen in love. It is your responsibility, I am not responsible for it.\nJainism is the most ascetic religion in the world, or in other words the most masochistic and sadistic. Jaina monks torture themselves so much that one wonders if they are insane. They are not. They are businessmen, and the followers of the Jaina monks are all businessmen. It is strange, the whole Jaina community consists only of businessmen – but not really strange because the religion itself is basically motivated for profit in the other world. The Jaina tortures himself in order to gain something in the other world which he knows he cannot attain in this.\nI must have been about four or five years old when I saw the first naked Jaina monk being invited into my grandmother’s house. I could not resist laughing. My grandfather told me, “Keep quiet! I know you are a nuisance. I can forgive you when you are a pain in the neck to the neighbors, but I cannot forgive you if you try to be mischievous with my guru. He is my master; he initiated me into the inner secrets of religion.”\nI said, “I am not concerned about the inner secrets. I am concerned about the outer secrets that he is showing so clearly. Why is he naked? Can’t he at least wear short pants?”\nEven my grandfather laughed. He said, “You don’t understand.”\nI said, “Okay, I will ask him myself.” I then asked my grandmother, “Can I ask a few questions to this utterly insane man who comes naked in front of ladies and gentlemen?”\nMy grandmother laughed and said, “Go ahead, and don’t take any notice of what your grandfather says. I allow you. If he says anything just indicate towards me and I will put him right.”\nShe was really a beautiful woman, courageous, ready to give freedom without any limits. She did not even ask me what I was going to ask. She simply said, “Go ahead”\nAll the villagers had assembled for the darshana of the Jaina monk. In the middle of the so-called sermon I stood up. That was forty or so years ago, and since then I have been fighting these idiots continuously. That day a war began which is only going to end when I am no more. Perhaps it may not end even then; my people may continue it.\nI asked simple questions that he could not answer. I was puzzled. My grandfather was ashamed. My grandmother patted me on the back and said, “Great! You did it! I knew you were able to.”\nWhat had I asked? – just simple questions. I had asked, “Why don’t you want to be born again?” That’s a very simple question in Jainism, because Jainism is nothing but an effort not to be born again. It is the whole science of preventing rebirth. So I asked him the basic question, “Don’t you ever want to be born again?”\nHe said, “No, never.”\nThen I asked, “Why don’t you commit suicide? Why are you still breathing? Why eat? Why drink water? Just disappear, commit suicide. Why make so much fuss over a simple thing?” He was not more than forty years of ageI said to him, “If you continue in this way, you may have to continue\nfor another forty years or even more.”\nIt is a scientific fact that people who eat less live longer. Devaraj will certainly agree with me. It has been proven again and again, that if you feed any species more than they need, they become fat, and comfortable of course, beautiful of course, but they soon die. If you feed them only half what they need, it is strange: they don’t look beautiful, they are not comfortable, but they live to almost double the average age. Half the food and double the age – double the food, and half the age.\nSo I said to the monk – I did not know these facts then – “If you don’t want to be born again, why are you living? Just to die? Then why not commit suicide?” I don’t think anybody had ever asked him such a question. In polite society nobody ever asks a real question, and the question of suicide is the most real of all.\nMarcel says, “Suicide is the only real philosophical question.” I had no idea of Marcel then. Perhaps at that time there was no Marcel, and his book had not been written yet. But this is what I said to the Jaina monk: “If you don’t want to be born again, which you say is your desire, then why do you live? For what? Commit suicide! I can show you a way. Although I don’t know much about the ways of the world, as far as suicide is concerned I can give you some advice. You can jump off the hill at the side of the village, or you can jump into the river.”\nThe river was three miles away from the village, and so deep and so vast that to swim across it was such a joy for me. Many times while swimming across the river I would think it was the end, and I would not be able to reach the other shore. It was so wide, particularly in the rainy season, miles wide. It looked almost like an ocean. In the rainy season one could not even see the other shore. When it was in full flood, that was when I would jump in, either to die or to reach the other shore. The greater probability was that I would never reach the other shore.\nI told the Jaina monk, “In the rainy season you can jump into the river with me. We can keep company for a little while, then you can die, and I will reach the other shore. I can swim well enough.”\nHe looked at me so fiercely, so full of anger, that I had to tell him, “Remember, you will have to be born again because you are still full of anger. This is not the way to get rid of the world of worries. Why are you looking at me so angrily? Answer my question in a peaceful and silent way. Answer joyously! If you cannot answer, simply say, ‘I don’t know.’ But don’t be angry.”\nThe man said, “Suicide is a sin. I cannot commit suicide, but I want never to be born again. I will achieve that state by slowly renouncing everything that I possess.”\nI said, “Please show me something that you possess, because, as far as I can see, you are naked and you don’t possess anything. What possessions do you have?”\nMy grandfather tried to stop me. I pointed towards my grandmother and then said to him, “Remember, I asked permission of Nani, and now nobody can prevent me, not even you. I spoke to her about you because I was worried that if I interrupted your guru and his rubbishy, so-called sermon, you would be angry with me. She said to ‘Just point towards me, that’s all. Don’t be worried: just a look from me and he will become silent.’ And strange... it was true!” He became silent, even without a look from my Nani.\nLater on my Nani and I both laughed. I said to her, “He did not even look at you.”\nShe said, “He could not, because he must have been afraid that I would say ‘Shut up! Don’t interfere with the child,’ so he avoided me. The only way to avoid me was to not interfere with you.”\nIn fact he closed his eyes as if he was meditating. I said to him, “Nana, great! – you are angry, boiling. There is fire within you yet you sit with closed eyes as if you are meditating. Your guru is angry because my questions are annoying him. You are angry because your guru is not capable of answering. But I say, this man who is sermonizing here is just an imbecile.” And I was not more than four or five years old.\nFrom that time on that has remained my language. I immediately recognize the idiot wherever he is, whoever he is. Nobody can escape my X-ray eyes. I can immediately see any retardedness, or anything else whatsoever.\nThe other day I had given one of my sannyasins the fountain pen that I wrote his new name with, just for him to remember that this was the pen I had used at the beginning of his new life, his sannyas. But his wife was there. I had even invited his wife to become a sannyasin. She was willing, and not willing – you know the way the women are: this way and that way; you never know exactly. Even\nwhen they show their right hand out of a car, you never know if they will really turn right. They may be feeling the wind, or nobody knows – they can be doing anything. That woman was willy-nilly, wishy- washy... a perfect woman in a way. She wanted to say yes and yet could not say it. She wanted to say no and yet could not say it-that kind of woman. And remember that is ninety-nine point nine percent of all women on the earth; only point one percent is left out. Otherwise that woman is very representative.\nStill I tried to seduce her – into sannyas, I mean! I played my game a little bit, and she was coming very close to saying yes when I stopped. I am also not so simple as it may seem from the outside. I don’t mean that I am complex, I mean that I can see things so clearly that sometimes I have to withdraw my simplicity and its invitation.\nWhen she was just about to say yes, she clutched her husband’s hand, who was now a sannyasin. I looked at him and could see that he wanted to get rid of this woman. She had tortured him enough. In fact he was hoping that by becoming a sannyasin this woman would have mercy, and leave him of her own accord. I could see his puzzlement when I was trying to persuade his wife to become a sannyasin. In his heart he was saying, “My God. If she becomes a sannyasin then even in Poona I can’t be at ease.”\nHe wants to become part of this ashram. He is a rich man and owns a multi-million-dollar business and wants to donate all of it to the ashram. He was afraid.I could see through and through this\nsannyasin and his wife.\nThere was no bridge between them, and there never had been. They were just an English couple, you know.… God knows why they married – and God does not exist. I repeat it again and again because I always feel you may think that God really knows! God does not know because He exists not.\nGod is a word like “jesus.” It does not mean anything, it is just an exclamation. That’s how the story goes, telling how Jesus got his name.…\nJoseph and Mary are taking their child back home from Bethlehem. Mary is sitting on the donkey with the child. Joseph is walking ahead holding the rope, leading the donkey. Suddenly he stumbles, hitting his toe on a rock. “Jesus!” he shouts. And you know the ways of women.…\nMary says, “Joseph! I was thinking what name to give to our new child, and just now you uttered the right name – Jesus!”\nThat’s how the poor child got his name. It is not a coincidence that when you hit your hand with a hammer by mistake, you exclaim, “Jesus!” Don’t think you are remembering Jesus; just remember poor Joseph hitting his toe on the rock.\nWhen I have stopped breathing Devaraj will know what to do. Although he is a partial Jewbut still\nhe is a man you can trust. I know he does not believe he is partly a Jew. He thinks a part of his family may have been Jewish, but he is not! That’s the way of all Jews, even part Jews. He seems to be perfect. A Jew is always a perfect Jew, to tell you the truth. Just a single drop of Jewishness in you is enough to make you a perfect Jew.\nBut I love Jews and I trust Jews. Just look in this Noah’s Ark: there are two and a half Jews. I am a perfect Jew without any hesitation. Devageet is not a perfect Jew, just a Jew. Devaraj is partially a Jew and making every effort to hide it – but that only makes it more Jewish. You cannot hide your Jewishness. Where will you hide your nose? That’s the only thing that remains unhidden in the whole body. You can hide everything except your nose, because you have to breathe.\nI was saying that Jesus, even Jesus, is not a name but only an exclamation made when Joseph hit his toe on a rock. So is God. When one says, “My God!” he does not mean that he believes in God. He is simply saying that he is complaining, if there is anyone in the sky to listen. When he says “God!” he simply means what is written on many government documents – “To Whom It May Concern.” “My God!” simply means “To whom it may concern,” or if there is nobody, then “Sorry, it concerns nobody. It is just an exclamation and I couldn’t resist it.”\nWhat is the time?... because I am half an hour late and I don’t want you to be late too. Once in a while I too can be nice. Just to remind you, this is the best you have been up to now. Very good. Even when it is very good I know how to say “enough”.…\nThis is tremendously beautiful, So beautiful,\nStop.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3165","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/glimpses_of_a_golden_childhood/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/glimpses_of_a_golden_childhood/>Glimpses of a Golden Childhood</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">7</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3165 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Glimpses_of_a_Golden_Childhood/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

still the same. I still remember the trust and your words. That trust
that once existed between us, is it still in your memory or not? I don’t
know about you but I still remember.”</p><p><br></p><p>Why do I go on playing the song of Noorjahan? It is a kind of
drilling. Not drilling of your teeth, although if you continue drilling
long enough it will get to your teeth too, but drilling into her the
beauty of a language. I know it will be difficult for her to understand
or appreciate it.</p><p><br></p><p>In my sleep when I speak to Gudia, I again speak in Hindi because I
know her unconscious is still not English. She was only in England for a
few years. Before that she was in India, and now she is again in India.
I have been trying to efface all that lies between these two. Of this
later, when the time comes.…</p><p><br></p><p>Today I was going to say something about Jainism. Look at the madness
of this man! Yes, I can jump from one peak to another without any bridge
between. But you have to tolerate a madman. You have fallen in love. It
is your responsibility, I am not responsible for it.</p><p><br></p><p>Jainism is the most ascetic religion in the world, or in other words
the most masochistic and sadistic. Jaina monks torture themselves so
much that one wonders if they are insane. They are not. They are
businessmen, and the followers of the Jaina monks are all businessmen.
It is strange, the whole Jaina community consists only of businessmen –
but not really strange because the religion itself is basically
motivated for profit in the other world. The Jaina tortures himself in
order to gain something in the other world which he knows he cannot
attain in this.</p><p><br></p><p>I must have been about four or five years old when I saw the first
naked Jaina monk being invited into my grandmother’s house. I could not
resist laughing. My grandfather told me, “Keep quiet! I know you are a
nuisance. I can forgive you when you are a pain in the neck to the
neighbors, but I cannot forgive you if you try to be mischievous with my
guru. He is my master; he initiated me into the inner secrets of
religion.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am not concerned about the inner secrets. I am concerned
about the outer secrets that he is showing so clearly. Why is he naked?
Can’t he at least wear short pants?”</p><p>Even my grandfather laughed. He said, “You don’t understand.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Okay, I will ask him myself.” I then asked my grandmother,
“Can I ask a few questions to this utterly insane man who comes naked in
front of ladies and gentlemen?”</p><p><br></p><p>My grandmother laughed and said, “Go ahead, and don’t take any notice
of what your grandfather says. I allow you. If he says anything just
indicate towards me and I will put him right.”</p><p><br></p><p>She was really a beautiful woman, courageous, ready to give freedom
without any limits. She did not even ask me what I was going to ask. She
simply said, “Go ahead<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>All the villagers had assembled for the darshana of the Jaina monk.
In the middle of the so-called sermon I stood up. That was forty or so
years ago, and since then I have been fighting these idiots
continuously. That day a war began which is only going to end when I am
no more. Perhaps it may not end even then; my people may continue
it.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked simple questions that he could not answer. I was puzzled. My
grandfather was ashamed. My grandmother patted me on the back and said,
“Great! You did it! I knew you were able to.”</p><p><br></p><p>What had I asked? – just simple questions. I had asked, “Why don’t
you want to be born again?” That’s a very simple question in Jainism,
because Jainism is nothing but an effort not to be born again. It is the
whole science of preventing rebirth. So I asked him the basic question,
“Don’t you ever want to be born again?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “No, never.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then I asked, “Why don’t you commit suicide? Why are you still
breathing? Why eat? Why drink water? Just disappear, commit suicide. Why
make so much fuss over a simple thing?” He was not more than forty years
of age<span class=s4></span>I said to him, “If you continue in this
way, you may have to continue</p><p>for another forty years or even more.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is a scientific fact that people who eat less live longer. Devaraj
will certainly agree with me. It has been proven again and again, that
if you feed any species more than they need, they become fat, and
comfortable of course, beautiful of course, but they soon die. If you
feed them only half what they need, it is strange: they don’t look
beautiful, they are not comfortable, but they live to almost double the
average age. Half the food and double the age – double the food, and
half the age.</p><p><br></p><p>So I said to the monk – I did not know these facts then – “If you
don’t want to be born again, why are you living? Just to die? Then why
not commit suicide?” I don’t think anybody had ever asked him such a
question. In polite society nobody ever asks a real question, and the
question of suicide is the most real of all.</p><p><br></p><p>Marcel says, “Suicide is the only real philosophical question.” I had
no idea of Marcel then. Perhaps at that time there was no Marcel, and
his book had not been written yet. But this is what I said to the Jaina
monk: “If you don’t want to be born again, which you say is your desire,
then why do you live? For what? Commit suicide! I can show you a way.
Although I don’t know much about the ways of the world, as far as
suicide is concerned I can give you some advice. You can jump off the
hill at the side of the village, or you can jump into the river.”</p><p>The river was three miles away from the village, and so deep and so
vast that to swim across it was such a joy for me. Many times while
swimming across the river I would think it was the end, and I would not
be able to reach the other shore. It was so wide, particularly in the
rainy season, miles wide. It looked almost like an ocean. In the rainy
season one could not even see the other shore. When it was in full
flood, that was when I would jump in, either to die or to reach the
other shore. The greater probability was that I would never reach the
other shore.</p><p><br></p><p>I told the Jaina monk, “In the rainy season you can jump into the
river with me. We can keep company for a little while, then you can die,
and I will reach the other shore. I can swim well enough.”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at me so fiercely, so full of anger, that I had to tell
him, “Remember, you will have to be born again because you are still
full of anger. This is not the way to get rid of the world of worries.
Why are you looking at me so angrily? Answer my question in a peaceful
and silent way. Answer joyously! If you cannot answer, simply say, ‘I
don’t know.’ But don’t be angry.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “Suicide is a sin. I cannot commit suicide, but I want
never to be born again. I will achieve that state by slowly renouncing
everything that I possess.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Please show me something that you possess, because, as far
as I can see, you are naked and you don’t possess anything. What
possessions do you have?”</p><p><br></p><p>My grandfather tried to stop me. I pointed towards my grandmother and
then said to him, “Remember, I asked permission of Nani, and now nobody
can prevent me, not even you. I spoke to her about you because I was
worried that if I interrupted your guru and his rubbishy, so-called
sermon, you would be angry with me. She said to ‘Just point towards me,
that’s all. Don’t be worried: just a look from me and he will become
silent.’ And strange... it was true!” He became silent, even without a
look from my Nani.</p><p><br></p><p>Later on my Nani and I both laughed. I said to her, “He did not even
look at you.”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “He could not, because he must have been afraid that I
would say ‘Shut up! Don’t interfere with the child,’ so he avoided me.
The only way to avoid me was to not interfere with you.”</p><p><br></p><p>In fact he closed his eyes as if he was meditating. I said to him,
“Nana, great! – you are angry, boiling. There is fire within you yet you
sit with closed eyes as if you are meditating. Your guru is angry
because my questions are annoying him. You are angry because your guru
is not capable of answering. But I say, this man who is sermonizing here
is just an imbecile.” And I was not more than four or five years
old.</p><p><br></p><p>From that time on that has remained my language. I immediately
recognize the idiot wherever he is, whoever he is. Nobody can escape my
X-ray eyes. I can immediately see any retardedness, or anything else
whatsoever.</p><p><br></p><p>The other day I had given one of my sannyasins the fountain pen that
I wrote his new name with, just for him to remember that this was the
pen I had used at the beginning of his new life, his sannyas. But his
wife was there. I had even invited his wife to become a sannyasin. She
was willing, and not willing – you know the way the women are: this way
and that way; you never know exactly. Even</p><p>when they show their right hand out of a car, you never know if they
will really turn right. They may be feeling the wind, or nobody knows –
they can be doing anything. That woman was willy-nilly, wishy- washy...
a perfect woman in a way. She wanted to say yes and yet could not say
it. She wanted to say no and yet could not say it-that kind of woman.
And remember that is ninety-nine point nine percent of all women on the
earth; only point one percent is left out. Otherwise that woman is very
representative.</p><p><br></p><p>Still I tried to seduce her – into sannyas, I mean! I played my game
a little bit, and she was coming very close to saying yes when I
stopped. I am also not so simple as it may seem from the outside. I
don’t mean that I am complex, I mean that I can see things so clearly
that sometimes I have to withdraw my simplicity and its invitation.</p><p><br></p><p>When she was just about to say yes, she clutched her husband’s hand,
who was now a sannyasin. I looked at him and could see that he wanted to
get rid of this woman. She had tortured him enough. In fact he was
hoping that by becoming a sannyasin this woman would have mercy, and
leave him of her own accord. I could see his puzzlement when I was
trying to persuade his wife to become a sannyasin. In his heart he was
saying, “My God. If she becomes a sannyasin then even in Poona I can’t
be at ease.”</p><p><br></p><p>He wants to become part of this ashram. He is a rich man and owns a
multi-million-dollar business and wants to donate all of it to the
ashram. He was afraid.<span class=s4></span>I could see through and
through this</p><p>sannyasin and his wife.</p><p><br></p><p>There was no bridge between them, and there never had been. They were
just an English couple, you know.… God knows why they married – and God
does not exist. I repeat it again and again because I always feel you
may think that God really knows! God does not know because He exists
not.</p><p><br></p><p>God is a word like “jesus.” It does not mean anything, it is just an
exclamation. That’s how the story goes, telling how Jesus got his
name.…</p><p><br></p><p>Joseph and Mary are taking their child back home from Bethlehem. Mary
is sitting on the donkey with the child. Joseph is walking ahead holding
the rope, leading the donkey. Suddenly he stumbles, hitting his toe on a
rock. “Jesus!” he shouts. And you know the ways of women.…</p><p><br></p><p>Mary says, “Joseph! I was thinking what name to give to our new
child, and just now you uttered the right name – Jesus!”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s how the poor child got his name. It is not a coincidence that
when you hit your hand with a hammer by mistake, you exclaim, “Jesus!”
Don’t think you are remembering Jesus; just remember poor Joseph hitting
his toe on the rock.</p><p><br></p><p>When I have stopped breathing Devaraj will know what to do. Although
he is a partial Jew<span class=s4></span>but still</p><p>he is a man you can trust. I know he does not believe he is partly a
Jew. He thinks a part of his family may have been Jewish, but he is not!
That’s the way of all Jews, even part Jews. He seems to be perfect. A
Jew is always a perfect Jew, to tell you the truth. Just a single drop
of Jewishness in you is enough to make you a perfect Jew.</p><p>But I love Jews and I trust Jews. Just look in this Noah’s Ark: there
are two and a half Jews. I am a perfect Jew without any hesitation.
Devageet is not a perfect Jew, just a Jew. Devaraj is partially a Jew
and making every effort to hide it – but that only makes it more Jewish.
You cannot hide your Jewishness. Where will you hide your nose? That’s
the only thing that remains unhidden in the whole body. You can hide
everything except your nose, because you have to breathe.</p><p><br></p><p>I was saying that Jesus, even Jesus, is not a name but only an
exclamation made when Joseph hit his toe on a rock. So is God. When one
says, “My God!” he does not mean that he believes in God. He is simply
saying that he is complaining, if there is anyone in the sky to listen.
When he says “God!” he simply means what is written on many government
documents – “To Whom It May Concern.” “My God!” simply means “To whom it
may concern,” or if there is nobody, then “Sorry, it concerns nobody. It
is just an exclamation and I couldn’t resist it.”</p><p><br></p><p>What is the time?... because I am half an hour late and I don’t want
you to be late too. Once in a while I too can be nice. Just to remind
you, this is the best you have been up to now. Very good. Even when it
is very good I know how to say “enough”.…</p><p><br></p><p>This is tremendously beautiful, So beautiful,</p><p>Stop.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

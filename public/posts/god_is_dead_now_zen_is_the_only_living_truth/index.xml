‌CHAPTER 5
God is your insecurity
10 February 1989 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
OUR BELOVED MASTER, SEKITO WROTE:
THE MIND OF THE GREAT SAGE OF INDIA WAS INTIMATELY COMMUNICATED FROM INDIA TO CHINA. IN HUMAN BEINGS THERE ARE WISE MEN AND FOOLS, BUT ON THE WAY THERE IS NO NORTHERN OR SOUTHERN TEACHER. THE MYSTERIOUS SOURCE IS CLEAR AND BRIGHT, THE BRANCHING STREAMS FLOW THROUGH THE DARKNESS.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
God is the original sinner
11 February 1989 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
OUR BELOVED MASTER, SEKITO WROTE:
CAUSE AND EFFECT BOTH NECESSARILY DERIVE FROM THE GREAT REALITY. THE WORDS ‘HIGH’ AND ‘LOW’ ARE USED RELATIVELY. WITHIN THE LIGHT THERE IS DARKNESS, BUT DO NOT BE ATTACHED TO THIS DARKNESS. WITHIN THE DARKNESS THERE IS LIGHT, BUT DO NOT LOOK FOR THAT LIGHT.</description>

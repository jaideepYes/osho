IF YOU COME BACK EVEN A LITTLE LATE, YOU WILL MISS ME. IF YOU MISS ME, YOU CANNOT GET THE BIG HATCHET UNDER MY CHAIR.”\nSOON SEKITO REACHED NANGAKU. BEFORE HANDING OVER THE LETTER, SEKITO MADE A BOW AND ASKED, “OSHO, WHEN ONE NEITHER FOLLOWS THE OLD SAINTS NOR EXPRESSES ONE’S INNERMOST SOUL, WHAT WILL ONE DO?”\nNANGAKU SAID, “YOUR QUESTION IS TOO ARROGANT. WHY DON’T YOU ASK MODESTLY?” TO WHICH SEKITO REPLIED, “THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SINK INTO HELL ETERNALLY AND NOT EVER HOPE FOR THE LIBERATION THAT THE OLD SAINTS KNOW.”\nSEKITO, FINDING THAT HE AND NANGAKU WERE NOT ATTUNED TO EACH OTHER, SOON LEFT FOR SEIGEN WITHOUT GIVING NANGAKU THE LETTER. ON HIS ARRIVAL, SEIGEN ASKED, “DID THEY ENTRUST SOMETHING TO YOU?”\nSEKITO SAID, “THEY DIDN’T ENTRUST ANYTHING TO ME.” SEIGEN SAID, “BUT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A REPLY.”\nSEKITO SAID, “IF THEY DON’T ENTRUST ANYTHING, THERE IS NO REPLY.” THEN HE SAID, “WHEN I WAS LEAVING HERE, YOU ADDED THAT I SHOULD COME BACK SOON TO RECEIVE THE BIG HATCHET UNDER THE CHAIR. NOW I HAVE COME BACK, PLEASE GIVE ME THE BIG HATCHET.”\nSEIGEN WAS SILENT. SEKITO BOWED DOWN AND RETIRED.\nFriends, before I answer your questions, I have to answer two letters by very knowledgeable idiots. This distinction has to be remembered. There is a certain ignorance that knows, and there is a certain knowledgeability that knows nothing.\nOne is a Buddhist scholar, and he writes that “An enlightened man cannot be concerned with the trivia of the ordinary world and its concerns.”\nIt means, according to him, I am an ignorant man. It is a compliment to me because every enlightened man finally becomes as ignorant as a child, or as innocent as a child. Socrates’ last words were, “I don’t know anything.”\nThis man is a scholar but blind. Does he think that a third world war which is going to erase the whole of humanity is trivia? Does he think that the explosion of the population in this country is trivia when it is going to kill almost five hundred million people in the coming ten years? And if these are trivia then I have to take him back to Gautam Buddha.\nHe was concerned that no sannyasin of his should have more than three pieces of clothes – that is trivia. He was concerned that no sannyasin of his should wear shoes – that is trivia. He was concerned that no sannyasin should eat more than one time in a day – that is trivia. And still he is enlightened and I am ignorant. This is what I call a knowledgeable idiot.\nBuddha has made thirty-three thousand rules for his disciples – all trivia. Where can you find thirty- three thousand truths? Truth is one and inexpressible. But he was concerned with absolute trivia.\nOne sannyasin was going to spread his message and had come for his last word, because he might not be coming back to him for two or three years. And what was his message? “Don’t see a woman.” Now, unless you see, you cannot decide whether the person is a woman or a man.\nI don’t understand what kind of nonsense Buddha was talking. How are you going to know that the person coming towards you is a woman? You have to see first, then you can close your eyes – but you have seen. And once you have seen a beautiful woman and you close your eyes, she becomes more beautiful. Is it not trivia?\nAnd Buddha told him, “You have to keep your eyes just four feet ahead of you. Just look only four feet ahead and keep your eyes down, so even if you come across a woman you only see her feet.” This is great spiritual stuff!\nThe man was a little puzzled. He said, “I will try my best, but if by chance I happen to see a woman accidentally – suddenly a woman comes out of the forest or on a crossroad – what should I do?”\nBuddha said, “If you accidentally see a woman, don’t talk to her.” Is it great spirituality? Don’t even say, “Hello,” because she is a woman!\nAnd the man insisted. He said, “If the woman says something, will it not be embarrassing to not answer her? Will it not be inhuman?”\nBuddha said, “If such a coincidence happens, you can talk to her, but don’t touch her.” Is this spiritual stuff?\nWhat do you call trivia? The whole humanity is going to die and I should not speak!? And your Gautam Buddha is talking absolute nonsense to his people.\nAnd the man was intelligent enough. He said, “There may be a situation in which I have to touch a woman. Perhaps a woman has fallen in a well, what am I supposed to do? Or in a ditch, what am I supposed to do? Should I just go on without looking at her miserable state, without helping her?”\nAnd Buddha said, “If such a coincidence happens, you can touch. But remember, all that is outside is illusory.”\nIf it is illusory then why make the first point? The woman is illusory and don’t touch her! What is the problem if you touch an illusion? Don’t talk to the illusion! Don’t look at the illusion! This I call absolute trivia.\nThese Buddhist scholars are going to provoke me. I will pull down Gautam Buddha completely!\nMy concern for humanity makes me ignorant, and his concern about women and about clothes and about shoes, and about not touching women, not looking more than four feet ahead, makes him enlightened! His enlightenment is rotten! It is a bullock-cart enlightenment.\nI am a contemporary man, twenty-five centuries ahead of Gautam Buddha. He is just old hat.\nBut these Buddhist scholars are provoking me. I will start talking about Gautam Buddha and will pull down the whole house that he has built, because it is built on all these stupid things.\nMy concern for humanity is absolutely spiritual. My concern for this beautiful planet is sacred. It is my compassion and my love. And I don’t care about any Gautam Buddha. I am a buddha in my own\nright, and your old Buddha is too out of date. I belong to my time, and I speak the language of my time.\nBuddha was afraid to allow women in his commune. For twenty years continuously he refused women. What was the fear? He did not trust his own sannyasins; this was distrust. A master distrusting his own people? He was afraid that if women enter into the commune, then what will happen to the celibacy of the monks? But if their celibacy is so thin that the entry of a woman is going to disturb their celibacy, it is not much of a celibacy.\nThey must have been homosexuals, as we are finding now in every monastery around the world that all kinds of sexual perversions are practiced. It cannot have been otherwise for Buddha’s disciples. Only my people are living a natural, sacred, existential life, not against the current, not against the universe.\nAnd without listening to me, without reading me, these idiots go on making their comments.\nMy whole effort is to bring materialism and spiritualism into balance. To me the outside world is as real as the inside world. Naturally this creates trouble for me from both sides. The communists have written books against me, for the reason that I am teaching spirituality and meditation and diverting people from their real concern, a classless society. And I am making people selfish because I am just telling them to go in.\nAnd the spiritualists are against me; they have written books against me, and articles, and every day there are letters. Their problem is that I am taking too much interest in the world. A man of real spirituality should close his eyes, because the world is illusory.\nBut none of your so-called and self-styled enlightened people have taken the trouble to think twice. When you say the world is illusory, then there is no need to renounce it. Nobody renounces dreams. Do you renounce your dream when you wake up in the morning? A dream is just a dream, there is no question of renouncing it. And if you are having a sweet dream, I say enjoy it.\nMake this whole world a sweet dream, not a nightmare. All your politicians and all your priests are trying to make it a nightmare. Then naturally people think to renounce it, it is such a tragedy.\nBut I am not in favor of renouncing the world, and I don’t say that the world is illusory; otherwise, why does Buddha go on begging every day? If the world is illusory why are you going to beg before an illusory house? And when a woman gives you food, she is illusory and the food is real?!\nWhy do you need three pieces of clothes? This was the criticism of Mahavira, Buddha’s contemporary, who lived naked. He did not accept Buddha as enlightened because he did not live naked. Three pieces of clothes were luxury to Mahavira, a man who lived naked in summer, in winter, in rain. Naturally he has the right to say to Buddha, “You are living in great luxury. Three pieces of clothes! You are too materialistic.”\nBuddha ate one meal a day; to Mahavira that was luxury. In the twelve years before Mahavira became enlightened, he ate on only three hundred and sixty-five days. In twelve years he ate for only one year – not continuously. Two months passed, and then one day he would eat; three months\npassed, and one day he would eat. That means, on average, that out of eleven days he would eat on one day. Of course, to him Buddha is indulging in luxury. These are relative terms.\nAnd Buddha was criticizing Mahavira for such trivial things, because he could not find answers to Mahavira’s criticism that he was living in luxury – daily food, three pieces of clothes. He found another way to criticize him, because the followers of Mahavira were saying that Mahavira is omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, with all the qualities of God. And Buddha was laughing at Mahavira, telling his disciples, “This fellow, this guy, says that he is omniscient, all knowing, and I know him... Once he was begging before a house in which nobody lived. And he talks about knowing everything: past, present, future, and he does not know that the house is empty, there is nobody there. For years it has been empty, and this man is omniscient?\n“And one day he was passing early in the morning, going to the river, when he stamped on the tail of a dog who was fast asleep on the road. When the dog started barking, then he realized. And this man is omniscient, all knowing, and he does not know that a dog is lying just in front of him?”\nDo you think these criticisms are very spiritual? Neither are Mahavira’s criticisms very spiritual, nor are Buddha’s criticisms very spiritual. Just trivia.\nSo I want to tell this Buddhist scholar to consider again who is enlightened.\nThe other is also a Buddhist scholar, and he had said to me, “I have been reading your books on Buddha, and I have appreciated them very much.” But he never then wrote any letter to me, nor any letter to the newspapers.\nIt is a strange thing: when I was saying things in appreciation, nobody ever wrote a single word. They thought what I was saying was really the meaning of Buddha’s sutras. It was not! The meaning was given by me, and I can take it away. I can tear down all your scriptures point by point!\nNow he has published a letter in the newspapers. Now he says, that I cannot have samadhi – enlightenment – because I don’t have sheel, I have only pragya. He does not understand at all – neither Buddha nor me. Pragya is a by-product of samadhi, of enlightenment. Pragya means wisdom. Unless you become enlightened, you cannot have wisdom, you can have only knowledge. And pragya does not mean knowledge, it means wisdom. It is a by-product of samadhi, enlightenment.\nBut he has no experience of samadhi, he has just seen the scriptures. And you will see in the coming sutra, an authentic seeker simply denies that he has anything to do with sheel. Sheel means character. Now he is concerned with my character, saying that without character you cannot become enlightened. What does he know about my character? And has he ever thought about the character of Buddha?\nFor twenty-nine years continuously Buddha was indulging in sex, and not only with his wife, he had many concubines. His father was told when he was born that either he would become a world emperor, or he would renounce the world and become an enlightened one. These were the two alternatives. Of course his father wanted him to become a world emperor.\nSo he asked how to prevent him from becoming enlightened. “I want him to become the world emperor.” He was a small king in a small kingdom. Arun has just brought from Nepal a picture of the palace – which is in ruins – where Buddha was born. Even in ruins you can see the kingdom was not great. The palace looks like just an ordinary big house. And it was in just a small village on the border of Nepal and India. Naturally his father must have had the ambition of Buddha becoming a great world conqueror.\nAnd the astrologers suggested, “If you want him to be prevented from enlightenment, then make every comfort and luxury possible for him. He should grow up in luxury and indulgence. He should not see anybody old, anybody dead. Even the flowers which are going to fall down should be removed before he sees them. All pale leaves which are going to fall should be removed.\n“And he should be made to live in different palaces in different seasons, so he never comes to feel any season is a trouble. So three palaces were made in different places: one for the summer, one for the winter, one for the rain. And great gardens were created around the palaces. And his father collected all the beautiful girls from the kingdom, to be his concubines. He was surrounded with women, music, wine for twenty-nine years, and he had a wife and a son. And he became enlightened.\nI don’t have a son, I don’t have a wife, I don’t have concubines, I don’t even have a girlfriend. And I don’t have character? And Buddha has character! No man has indulged more than Gautam Buddha. What character...?\nHe had five disciples before his enlightenment. They were disciples because he was an ascetic. He was torturing himself fasting and had become just a skeleton. And these five disciples were immensely impressed by his self-torture. The whole of humanity lives with this idea: if you torture yourself you are a saint.\nThe day he became enlightened, he dropped all self-torture; it was absolutely useless. All the five disciples left him immediately: he has fallen, fallen from saintliness. He had become enlightened, and those five disciples who had been with him for many years, respecting him as a great saint, just left him, saying, “He has fallen. He has started eating, he has started having warm clothes.”\nPerhaps these Buddhist scholars don’t understand anything at all except the scriptures.\nCharacter arises out of enlightenment, it is not vice versa. It is not character that produces enlightenment, otherwise enlightenment would have a cause to it. Enlightenment is your nature; it has no cause. It is already there, you just have to discover it. It does not matter what kind of character you have. If you go inwards the sinner will find the buddha just as much as the saint. And after you have found your enlightenment, the radiation of the enlightenment becomes your character, your sheel.\nYour enlightenment becomes your innocence, and out of that innocence arises wisdom. But wisdom is not knowledge, it is simply transparent clarity about everything, inner or outer.\nBut these knowledgeable idiots simply prove one thing that I have been continuously telling you: don’t get involved in scholarship, don’t get involved in knowledgeability. That is the greatest barrier to enlightenment, because you are so full of knowledge, and all knowledge is of the mind.\nEnlightenment is not of the mind, it is the fragrance of no-mind. No-mind is not based on any character. Just the contrary: all character arises out of the clarity of no-mind. So it is not imposed from outside as a discipline. It arises as a spontaneous response. You simply cannot do any evil. It is not a question of your deciding not to do evil, you simply cannot do it. You are so full of light, how can you behave like a blind man? You are so full of light, how can you behave like a man stumbling in darkness?\nSo character arises, wisdom arises, and a thousand other things: blissfulness, ecstasy, benediction, compassion. There is no end; more and more flowers go on flowering.\nBut this is the difficulty of the knowledgeable person. He has accepted a certain fixed formula.\nI want you to know absolutely clearly that just as everything goes on expanding and growing, even enlightenment becomes clearer, deeper, higher as time passes. After twenty-five centuries, I am not going to be a replica of Gautam Buddha. I have nothing to learn from him. If anything has to be, he has to learn something from me. Twenty-five centuries have not been a mere wastage. Just as everything is progressing and evolving, so is consciousness.\nBut every scholar gets completely fucked-up! He thinks only in terms of his scripture, and the scripture is twenty-five centuries old. I am a contemporary man, and I do not belong to any category. I am a category in myself. I decide according to my spontaneous response, not according to any commandments, not according to any discipline. Whether the discipline is given by Buddha or Mahavira or Christ or Krishna, it does not matter; they are all old. But these people are living in the past.\nI am moving moment to moment into the future. I have left Gautam Buddha twenty-five centuries behind. His enlightenment also is twenty-five centuries old. So much dust has gathered on it. But my mirror of consciousness is absolutely fresh, and I am not going to listen to anybody. Nobody is my master! And nobody has the right to tell me what character is and what is wisdom and what is enlightenment. Nobody has that right.\nI am a man absolutely free. I live my life according to my own light. I am nobody’s follower, and I don’t live my life according to any scripture. These idiots should shut up! Because of them I will be provoked to condemn Buddha and Mahavira and Krishna and everybody! And they won’t have any argument against me.\nHow can these people say that Buddha was not concerned with trivia? He was concerned. And my concern is not trivia.\nMy concern is a third world war that is hanging just on the horizon. Any moment there will be no life on earth, and no possibility of any buddha! And you call it trivia?\nBeware of scholars. They are the most idiotic people in the world. Your questions.\nQuestion 1\nThe first question:\nGOD IS DEAD, BUT THAT CREATES THE QUESTION: WHO BEGAN THIS UNIVERSE?\nThere is no need for anybody to begin it, because there is no beginning to this universe, and there is no end.\nThis question has been exploited by all the religions, because everybody wants to know who began the universe, because your minds are so small they cannot conceive a beginningless universe, an endless universe, just eternity to eternity. Because you cannot conceive that vastness, your question arises, “Who created the universe? Who began it?” But if there was somebody already to begin it, there was a universe. Do you see the simple arithmetic? If there was somebody already to begin it, then you cannot call it the beginning, somebody was already there.\nIf you think that God is a necessary thing... it gives you consolation that God created the world, so you have a beginning. But who created God? Again you fall into the same problem.\nAnd all the religions have said that God exists eternally, there is no creator of God. If that is true for God, why is it not true for existence itself? It is autonomous, it exists on its own. There is no need of any creator because that creator will require another creator, and you will fall into an absurd regress. You can go from A to Z. But who created Z? The question remains standing, you simply go on pushing. But the question is not solved because you have asked a wrong question.\nThe universe has no beginning, it is not a creation by anybody. It has no end. And remember, if it had any beginning, then there would certainly be an end. Every beginning is a beginning of an end. Every birth is the beginning of death. So it is good. Get rid of God, because if he can create the world he can destroy the world. And any world that is created is bound to be destroyed sooner or later. If there is birth, there is death. Only a beginningless universe can be endless.\nSo your problem is just because the capacity of the mind is very limited. That’s why I want you to go beyond mind. Only no-mind can conceive the beginningless, the endless; the incomprehensible becomes absolutely clear. There is no problem at all. Those who have risen beyond mind have also risen beyond God simultaneously. God is a need for the mind, because the mind cannot conceive infinite, eternal things. It can only conceive very limited things. The question arises because of your mind’s incapacity, its impotence.\nYou ask, “God is dead, but that creates the question, ‘Who began this universe?’”\nBut have you ever thought that God will not solve the question? On the contrary, the question will be pushed a step back: who created God? Any hypothesis that does not destroy the question is absolutely useless. Any answer that keeps on pushing the question further back but does not touch it at all, is not the answer.\nThe only answer you will find is in your own experience of eternity. Then you will know nobody has created it. It has no beginning, no end. You don’t have any beginning, you don’t have any end. When you experience it within your own self, you know existence is autonomous, it is not created.\nA created thing cannot be more than a mechanism; it cannot be an organic reality. A car is created, man is not created. If man is also created he becomes a mechanism, a robot. You can dismantle a car, take all the parts apart – the wheels and everything – and you can put them back and the car will be perfectly okay. But cut a man into pieces and then join them together – with German glue! – still the man will not be back. An organic phenomenon cannot be dissected. The moment you dissect it, its very mystery disappears. Then you can join those parts, but you will have only a corpse, not a living human being.\nIt is the dignity of existence that it is not created. It is the dignity of man that he is not created. God is an insult to existence, to man, to consciousness, to everything! God is a humiliation. God is not a solution for any problem. In fact, he creates more problems in the world and he does not solve anything.\nThere are three hundred religions in the world and all are fighting with each other. These are all created because of the concept of God, because they have all invented their own concepts.\nThe Hindu god has three heads. Just think of the poor fellow. Imagine you have three heads. I don’t think you will be able to stand up. One head will be falling this side, one head will be falling that side, this head will be falling this side, the very weight... I have seen the statues and the pictures of the Hindu god. His whole body seems to be just like a man; it cannot manage three heads.\nI have seen children in circuses who are freaks of nature. I have seen children with two heads, but they cannot even sit; they are just lying down. The circus is enjoying their tragedy, earning money...\nOne man had gone to see a circus, and there was a three-headed child in the circus. The man was very much concerned because all his children – he had twenty children, four wives, he was a Mohammedan... The fee was one rupee per person, and every child of his insisted on seeing. There was great trouble. The father was trying to convince them, “We don’t have twenty rupees. I can stay out, and I can send you, but we don’t have twenty rupees.”\nThe owner of the child, who was distributing tickets, heard all this argument between the children and the father. He said, “Wait. I will give you twenty rupees. Let me bring the child with three heads. He can see you are a bigger phenomenon! One man with twenty children.” And he brought the child in a trolley to look at this man who had twenty children. And he gave him twenty rupees as a fee, because, “This boy also needs some entertainment. He gives entertainment to thousands of people.”\nBut that boy could not see from any of his three faces and six eyes. It was difficult for him even to turn in the trolley. The Hindu god must be living in a trolley. One head will always be pushing against the pillow, breathing will be difficult. And walking is out of the question.\nAnd all three gods, who have one body, have three wives. Just see the tragedy. Each god is joined with two other gods, and each god has a separate wife. Three wives to one man, because the sexual machinery is only one. I have never heard that the Indian god has three sexual machineries. Now, I cannot figure out how things are managed.\nThese fictions create three hundred religions, because everybody is free to have his own fiction. Why borrow anybody else’s fiction? There are religions which think that god has one thousand\nhands. One thousand hands? They must be growing all over the body just like branches in a tree. And I don’t think he can manage to do anything. One thousand hands? From the back they will be growing backwards, from the front they will be growing... there will be no space left for anything else!\nAnd there are gods which have one thousand eyes! I cannot conceive it. Even with no-mind I cannot conceive it. One thousand eyes in one head? Then there is no possibility for ears, no possibility for the nose, no possibility for the mouth, no possibility for anything – not even hair. He must be bald-headed, with eyes all over the head. Even then I don’t think he can manage one thousand eyes. How will he move? According to which eye will he see? Even if he winks at a woman, which eye? One thousand eyes winking at one woman! That will be real romance!\nGod has not solved any problem, God has created thousands of problems. And every religion has its own idea, because it is a fiction. You don’t have different ideas about the sun. You don’t have different ideas about the rose. You can have only different ideas about a fiction. It is then up to you, whichever way you want.\nThe Bible says God created man in his own image. The reality is just the opposite: man has created God in his own image. And he has been trying to refine the image of God, finding explanations for all kinds of absurdities. He needs one thousand hands because he has to care for five billion people. But if you have to care about five billion people, you need five billion hands. One thousand hands won’t do. At least, if you want even to shake hands with the whole of humanity, you will need five billion hands. Just hands and hands and nothing else! And you go on shaking and nobody is there!\nThey go on finding explanations: he has one thousand eyes because he has to look after the whole universe. Can’t he move his head, just the way I am moving mine? I can see ten thousand people without any difficulty, just with two eyes. Does he not move backwards and go in reverse? He has eyes all over his head, so when he wants to go backwards, the front eyes are closed, the backward eyes are open. When he wants to go sideways, three sides are closed, the right side is open. Is it a god or some kind of toy to entertain children?\nThe very idea of God is because our mind cannot comprehend eternity. Once you rise beyond your limited mind to an unlimited no-mind, you can conceive all that was inconceivable before. No God is needed.\nQuestion 2\nThe second question:\nIS THERE ANY PLACE FOR PRAYER IN RELIGION IF THERE IS NO GOD?\nThere is no place for prayer, because prayer is God-oriented. If there is no God, to whom can you pray? All prayers are false because there is nobody to answer them, nobody to hear them. All prayers are humiliations, insults, degradations. All prayers are disgusting! You are kneeling down to a fiction which does not exist.\nAnd what are you doing in your prayers? Begging. “Give me this, give me that” – utterly beggarly – “God, give me my daily bread!” Can’t you ask once for all? Every day? And five billion people asking,\nand only one person listening? Do you think he will remain sane? “Give me my daily bread?” Why not ask for the whole life and be finished? One prayer will do.\nBut every day bothering him, nagging him like a wife, morning and evening. And there are Mohammedans who do five prayers a day. They are the great naggers.\nI used to go to take meditation camps in Udaipur. It was a long journey from the place I used to live, Jabalpur. Thirty-six hours, because there was no plane at that time. In Jabalpur there was an airport, but it was a military airport, and they were not allowed to open it for the public. Now it is opened.\nSo I had to go in a train and change at many junctions. First, I would have to change at Katni, then I would have to change at Bina, then I would have to change at Agra. Then I would have to change at Chittaurgarh, and finally I would reach Udaipur. It was evening time when the train reached Chittaurgarh. And Ajmer is very close to Chittaurgarh. Ajmer is one of the strongholds of the Mohammedans, so in the train there were many Mohammedans. And the train had to stay for one hour for some other train to come which was bringing passengers for this train also, to go on to Udaipur.\nSo for one hour I used to walk on the platform. All the Mohammedans lining the platform were sitting in prayer, and I was enjoying them. I would just go near somebody and say, “The train is leaving,” and he would jump up. And then he would be angry at me, “You disturbed my prayer.”\nI said, “I did not disturb anybody’s prayer. I am simply doing my prayer. This is my heartfelt desire that the train should leave! I was not talking to you. I don’t even know your name!”\nHe would say, “This is strange... in the middle of my prayer?”\nI said, “It was not prayer because I was watching, you have been looking again and again at the train.” He said, “That is true.”\nAnd it was the same all over the platform. I would go to a few people further up and just whisper, “The train is leaving,” and again another person would jump up and would be very angry: “What kind of person are you? You look religious, and you disturb people in their prayer?”\nI said, “I am not disturbing anybody. I am just praying to God that the train should leave now.”\nWhat are your prayers? Begging this, begging that, your prayer reduces you into a beggar. Meditation transforms you into an emperor. There is nobody to hear your prayers, there is nobody to answer your prayers. All religions go on making you extrovert so that you don’t turn inwards. Prayer is an extrovert thing: God is there, and you are shouting to that God. But it is taking you away from yourself.\nEvery prayer is irreligious.\nI have told you the beautiful story by Leo Tolstoy.\nThe archbishop of the old Orthodox Church of Russia – it is a story set before the revolution – became very much worried when many people from his congregation started going towards a lake. There were three villagers on a small island in the lake who sat under a tree, with thousands of people who thought they were saints.\nIn Christianity you cannot be a saint on your own account. The word saint comes from sanction. You have to be sanctioned by the church that you are a saint; it is a certificate. It is such an ugly idea that the church can give you a certificate that you are a saint. Even a man like Francis of Assisi, a beautiful man, was summoned by the pope: “People have started worshipping you like a saint, and you don’t have any certificate.”\nAnd that’s where I feel Francis missed the point. He should have refused, but he knelt just like a Christian and asked the pope, “Give me the certificate.” Otherwise he was a nice man, a beautiful man, but I don’t mention his name because he acted in a very stupid way. This is not the way of a saint.\nI don’t need anybody’s certificate for my enlightenment or for my buddhahood. I declare it! I don’t need anybody’s certificate. Who can give me the certificate? Even Gautam Buddha cannot give me the certificate. Who gave him a certificate?\nBut the idea of ‘saint’ in English is very wrong. It comes from sanctus.\nSo the archbishop of Russia was very angry: “Who are these saints? I have not certified anybody in years. Where have these saints suddenly arrived from?” But people were going and the church was becoming more and more empty every day.\nFinally he decided to go and see who these people were. So he took a motorboat and went to the island. And those three villagers... they were uneducated, simple people, utterly innocent, and the archbishop was a powerful man; next to the czar he was the most powerful man in Russia. He was very angry at those three villagers and told them, “Who made you saints?”\nThey looked at each other. They said, “Nobody. And we don’t think we are saints, we are poor people.”\n“But why are so many people coming here?” They said, “You have to ask them.”\nHe said, “Do you know the orthodox prayer of the church?”\nThey said, “We are uneducated and the prayer is too long, we cannot remember it.” “So what prayer do you say?”\nThey all looked at each other. “You tell him,” said one.\n“You tell him,” said another. They were feeling embarrassed.\nBut the archbishop became more and more arrogant, seeing that these were absolute idiots, “They don’t even know the prayer. How can they be saints?” So he said, “Anybody can tell me. Just say it!”\nThey said, “We are feeling very embarrassed because we have made our own prayer, not knowing the authorized prayer of the church. We have made our own prayer, very simple it is. Please forgive us that we did not ask your permission, but we were feeling so embarrassed we did not come.\n“Our prayer is – God is three and we are also three, so we have made a prayer – ‘You are three and we are three, have mercy on us.’ This is our prayer.”\nThe archbishop was very angry: “This is no prayer. I have never heard this kind of thing.” He started laughing.\nThose poor fellows said, “You teach us what the real prayer is. We thought it was perfectly alright: God is three, we are three, and what more is needed? Just have mercy on us.”\nSo he told them the orthodox prayer, which was a long prayer. By the time he ended, they said, “We have forgotten the beginning.” So he told the beginning again. Then they said, “We have forgotten the end.”\nThe archbishop was getting angry and irritated. He said, “What kind of people are you? Can’t you remember a simple prayer?”\nThey said, “It is too long and we are uneducated, and such big words. We cannot... You just be patient with us. If you repeat it two or three times perhaps we will get the knack of it.” So he repeated it three times. They said, “Okay, we will try, but we are afraid that it may not be the complete prayer... some things may be missing... but we will try.”\nThe arrogant archbishop was very much satisfied that he had finished these three saints and he could tell his people, “They are idiots. Why are you going there?” And he left in the boat.\nSuddenly he saw that behind his boat those three people were running on the water, coming after him. He could not believe his eyes; he rubbed his eyes. By that time they had reached the side of his boat, standing on the water. And they said, “Just one time more, we forgot.”\nBut seeing the situation: “These people are walking on water and I am going in the motorboat,” he said, “You continue your prayer. Don’t bother about what I have said to you. Just forgive me, I was arrogant. Your simpleness, your innocence is your prayer. You just go. You don’t need any certificate.”\nBut they insisted, “You have come so far. Just one time more... We know we might forget it, but one time more so we can remember it.”\nBut the archbishop said, “I have been repeating that prayer my whole life, and it has not been heard. And you are walking on water, and we have heard only in the miracles of Jesus that he used to walk on water. This is the first time I have seen the miracle. You just go back. Your prayer is perfectly alright!”\nThe prayer was not the thing because there is nobody to hear it, but their utter innocence and trust transformed them into totally new beings, so fresh, so childlike, just like roseflowers opening in the early morning sun in all their beauty.\nNow that the arrogance was dropped, the archbishop could see their faces, their innocence, their grace, their blissfulness. They returned back on the water, running hand in hand, and reached their tree.\nLeo Tolstoy was refused the Nobel Prize because of such stories. He was nominated. The Nobel Prize committee opens its records every fifty years – in this century only one time. In the middle of this century it opened its records. So when they were opened in 1950, researchers rushed to see in the records whose names were nominated and cancelled, and what was the reason. Leo Tolstoy was nominated, but never given the prize. And the reason was written underneath, that he is not an orthodox Christian. He writes such stories, such novels... Although he is a Christian, but he is not an orthodox Christian, so the Nobel Prize cannot be given.\nBut it has never been told to the world that the Nobel Prize exists only for orthodox Christians. Leo Tolstoy was one of the most simple-hearted, innocent people, one of the most creative persons the world has ever known. His novels have such a beauty.\nHis life was also very simple, although he was a count; his forefathers belonged to the royal family and he still had a vast palace and thousands of acres of land and thousands of slaves. His wife was very angry with him – for his whole life this was a trouble – because he lived like a slave and worked like the slaves in the fields. He was very friendly with the slaves. He slept in their poor huts and ate their food.\nThey could not believe it. They said, “Master, you are our owner.”\nHe said, “No. We are all sharing. I work with you, I can eat with you, I can sleep here.”\nHis wife was really angry. She was a countess; she herself belonged to a very rich family, another count’s family, and she could not believe he was this kind of man. “He lives with those dirty people, he eats their food. He goes to work in the field. He does not need...”\nAnd such a simple man, innocent man, creative man was refused the Nobel Prize on the ground that he is not Orthodox church, he does not belong to the orthodox line of fanatic Christians. Even I was amazed when I read that statement.\nSo this Nobel Prize is just for orthodox and fanatic Christians, politicians, not for creative artists. You are asking, “Is there any place for prayer in religion?” None at all.\nIn an authentic religion, meditation has a place, but not prayer. Prayer is extrovert, meditation is introvert. Meditation makes you a buddha, prayer simply makes you a beggar. And prayer is fiction- oriented, meditation is truth-oriented. Meditation is Zen, and prayer is nothing but part and parcel of the fiction called God. Avoid prayers, they are taking you away from your own existential reality. Go deeper into meditation. That is the only religiousness possible.\nThe sutras:\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\nWHEN SEKITO RECEIVED THE PRECEPTS, HIS MASTER, SEIGEN, ASKED HIM, “NOW YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE PRECEPTS, YOU WANT TO LEARN THE VINAYA, DON’T YOU?”\nVinaya is one of the scriptures of Gautam Buddha. The whole name is vinaya pitak.\nSeigen asked Sekito, “You are initiated into sannyas, do you now want to learn the scriptures called VINAYA?” The word vinaya means humbleness. It is one of the series of discourses of Buddha.\nSEKITO REPLIED, “THERE IS NO NEED TO LEARN THE VINAYA.”\nThere is no need to learn the scriptures, because truth is never found in any scripture. Truth is not a philosophy or a theology. There is no need.\nSekito was sent to Seigen by his master, Eno. He was already ripe, but because Eno felt death was coming too fast – he was very old – and perhaps he would not be able to see the enlightenment of Sekito, he felt it was better to send him to a master who can help him in the last stages of his evolution. So he sent him to Seigen, who has been his lifelong competitor. But both recognized each other in their hearts as enlightened.\nSekito is not a beginner, so when Seigen asked, “Would you like to learn the scriptures?” He said, “There is no need to learn the scriptures.”\nSEIGEN ASKED, “THEN, YOU WANT TO READ THE BOOK OF SHEELA – the book of character?\nIf you don’t want to learn scriptures about humbleness, would you like to know about scriptures which deal with character, morality?”\nSheela means character. This is what the Buddhist scholar has raised in his question against me: without sheela how can you become enlightened?\nSEKITO REPLIED – and this is the reply of a man who was coming very close to enlightenment – “THERE IS NO NEED TO READ THE BOOK OF SHEELA, because all these things will follow enlightenment. They don’t precede, they succeed.”\nEnlightenment contains immense treasures. You just become enlightened and everything follows. You don’t have to learn, you don’t have to discipline yourself, you don’t have to make any effort; everything spontaneously follows you. Just first become a buddha.\nSo he said, “There is no need to read the book of character and morality.” SEIGEN ASKED, “CAN YOU DELIVER A LETTER TO NANGAKU OSHO?”\nNangaku was another famous master, and this was just a strategy of Seigen. He was trying to figure out where Sekito was. All these questions are not for any answers; he was trying to figure out the\nnewly-arrived person who has lived with a great master, Eno, how far he has reached, how deep he has reached. He is trying to figure out from every nook and corner, so that he can know how ripe he is, and know how much ripening he needs.\nSo this was another methodology. He failed when asking about the Vinaya scriptures; Sekito answered exactly as if he was already enlightened. He asked about Sheela scriptures, and he answered exactly as if he was already enlightened.\nThen he tried a different way. He said,\n“CAN YOU DELIVER A LETTER TO NANGAKU OSHO?”\nNangaku lived in another mountain monastery nearby. SEKITO SAID, “CERTAINLY.”\nSEIGEN SAID, “GO NOW, AND COME BACK QUICKLY. IF YOU COME BACK EVEN A LITTLE LATE, YOU WILL MISS ME. IF YOU MISS ME, YOU CANNOT GET THE BIG HATCHET UNDER MY CHAIR.”\nSOON SEKITO REACHED NANGAKU. BEFORE HANDING OVER THE LETTER, SEKITO MADE A BOW AND ASKED, “OSHO, WHEN ONE NEITHER FOLLOWS THE OLD SAINTS NOR EXPRESSES ONE’S INNERMOST SOUL, WHAT WILL ONE DO?”\nHis question is very important. He is saying – with absolute respect – he is saying,\n“OSHO, WHEN ONE NEITHER FOLLOWS THE OLD SAINTS NOR EXPRESSES ONE’S INNERMOST SOUL, WHAT WILL ONE DO?”\nNANGAKU SAID, “YOUR QUESTION IS TOO ARROGANT.\nNobody asks such a question immediately. You entered into my temple and you started asking me questions. First, you need initiation. First, you have to be a disciple. I am not here to waste my time on anybody who passes by and asks any type of question. This is arrogance.”\nIt was not arrogance, but that was part of the strategy of Seigen. Nangaku was a very different kind of master.\nNANGAKU SAID, “YOUR QUESTION IS TOO ARROGANT. WHY DON’T YOU ASK MODESTLY?” TO WHICH SEKITO REPLIED, “THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SINK INTO HELL ETERNALLY AND NOT EVER HOPE FOR THE LIBERATION THAT THE OLD SAINTS KNOW.”\n“If you call my question arrogant, then I would rather suffer eternally in hell than ask you any question modestly.”\nNo question is ever modest. Every question has to be, in a certain way, arrogant. When you are questioning, you are showing doubt, you are interfering in the silence of the master. Obviously, every\nquestion is arrogant, no question can be modest. Only silence is modest. But that is not a question, that is the answer.\nBut Sekito was really a man with a spine, with guts. He said, “Forget all about the question. I will not ask the question modestly, because no question can be asked modestly. The very question is arrogant. Any question is a doubt. Any question is interfering in the energy field of the master.\n“Only silence can be modest. But then I don’t have to come to you. I can be silent anywhere. I can be silent even in the eternal fire of hell.”\nSekito is really a man of great intelligence and great courage. Nangaku could not put him down. He was sent specially to Nangaku who was known to be very hard. And Seigen wanted to know about Sekito’s response, what response he would make to Nangaku.\nAnd he really made the right response. He said, “Forget all about the question. I would rather fall into hell eternally than ask you a question with modesty. No question is modest, howsoever put. And I have asked it very respectfully. I have called you ‘Osho, my beloved master’, and you call my question arrogant. Rather than answering it you are insulting me.\n“No master insults his disciples, and I am not even a disciple. I am just a stranger, and you are not being nice to me. I am just a guest. You should welcome me. Rather than welcoming me, you are humiliating me. I am not going to ask any question.”\nSEKITO, FINDING THAT HE AND NANGAKU WERE NOT ATTUNED TO EACH OTHER, SOON LEFT FOR SEIGEN WITHOUT GIVING NANGAKU THE LETTER.\nThat man does not deserve even the letter. And he did not stay there, he immediately left. ON HIS ARRIVAL, SEIGEN ASKED, “DID THEY ENTRUST SOMETHING TO YOU?” SEKITO SAID, “THEY DID NOT ENTRUST ANYTHING TO ME.”\nSEIGEN SAID “BUT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A REPLY.”\nSEKITO SAID, “IF THEY DON’T ENTRUST ANYTHING, THERE IS NO REPLY.” THEN HE SAID, “WHEN I WAS LEAVING HERE, YOU ADDED THAT I SHOULD COME BACK SOON TO RECEIVE THE BIG HATCHET UNDER THE CHAIR. NOW I HAVE COME BACK, PLEASE GIVE ME THE BIG HATCHET.”\nSEIGEN WAS SILENT. SEKITO BOWED DOWN AND RETIRED.\nThe silence of Seigen was his acceptance of Sekito, his courage. He knew that the letter had not been delivered, that there had not been any reply, although Sekito had not mentioned the letter. Sekito simply said, “They did not entrust anything to me, so how can there be any reply?”\nSeigen saw the man, that he has the quality and deserves to be enlightened. His silence was his hatchet. He was saying, “When you come I am going to cut your head with a hatchet.”\nAnd now he reminded him, “NOW I HAVE COME BACK, PLEASE GIVE ME THE BIG HATCHET.\nCut my head. Do whatsoever you want to do, I am ready.”\nSeigen was silent. In that deep silence is the transfer, the transmission of the lamp. It is not a question of language, it is a question of a transfer of energy. Just simply in that silence the flame jumped from Seigen to Sekito.\nAnd because he received the flame, the fire, he immediately bowed down and retired. Now there is no need to disturb the master. He has been accepted, not only accepted; the last step for which he had come has been delivered.\nEno was dead before Sekito became enlightened. In fact, the moment Sekito left Eno, before he reached to Seigen, Eno died. He was absolutely aware that death was coming close, and Seigen is the right person to whom Sekito should be handed over. He was absolutely correct in his judgment; it was Seigen who finally managed Sekito’s enlightenment.\nBut enlightenment happens in silence. That’s why my whole effort here is to make you as silent as possible. Then you don’t need even a Seigen. Sitting anywhere – in your room, under a tree, in the garden, by the side of the river, anywhere – if your silence deepens, existence itself gives you the initiation into buddhahood. And when it comes directly from existence itself, it has a far greater beauty than when it comes through a master.\nI teach you immediate, sudden enlightenment. The meditation that you are practicing is just preparing you for that great silence in which existence will become a flame inside you.\nEtsujin wrote:\nFALLING\nBUT WITH EASY HEARTS – POPPIES.\nThe flowers are falling with easy hearts. They are not even looking back to the tree they have been blossoming on, the tree that has been their home for so long, the tree that has been their nourishment for so long. Now they are going back to the earth from where they have come.\nFalling, but with easy hearts... There is no regret. They enjoyed the sun, they enjoyed the moon, they enjoyed the stars. They danced in the wind, they danced in the rain, they danced, celebrated. What more does one need? It is time to go into eternal rest. That’s why their hearts are easy, no tension, no anxiety. They lived totally, they are dying dancingly. They are coming very easily towards the earth where they will disappear again. They came from the earth, the round is complete, they are going back to the earth.\nJust as flowers arise from the earth and go back to the earth for eternal rest, you come from existence and you return to existence if you have an easy heart. Then you will not be coming again into the imprisonment of a body. You will simply go back to the very source you have come from, to eternal rest.\nThat eternal rest is nirvana, that eternal rest is moksha, that eternal rest is liberation, that eternal rest is samadhi, truth, enlightenment – different names for the same experience. You have come back home, and you have come back home dancing, with no regret, with no complaint, with easy hearts, peacefully and silently to disappear. This is the most exquisite experience, when you are on the verge of disappearing with an easy and relaxed heart, a simple and pure let-go.\nQuestion 3\nManeesha’s question:\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\nIN HIS BOOK, The Antichrist, NIETZSCHE STATES: “PEOPLE WHO STILL BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES STILL ALSO HAVE THEIR OWN GOD. IN HIM THEY VENERATE THE CONDITIONS THROUGH WHICH THEY HAVE PROSPERED, THEIR VIRTUES – THEY PROJECT THEIR JOY IN THEMSELVES, THEIR FEELING OF POWER ON TO A BEING WHOM ONE CAN THANK FOR THEM.” WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT?\nManeesha, Nietzsche wrote his book THE ANTICHRIST in the insane asylum. But he was such a genius, that even though he was declared insane by all the psychiatrists, his books prove they were wrong. Even in his insanity he was far saner than your so-called sane psychiatrists. Even in his death – he wrote his last letter to a friend – he did not forget... He had always made his signature, “Antichrist, Friedrich Nietzsche”. Even at the moment of death he did not forget to write “Antichrist” first, then his name.\nAnd in that insane asylum he wrote many things which are of tremendous importance. THE ANTICHRIST is one of the books that will help you to understand Nietzsche’s depth. Although he never went beyond mind, he managed even with his mind to reach to great heights and to great depths.\nHe was anti-Christ his whole life, because he said, “Christ’s teachings are a humiliation to humanity, because he calls humanity sheep and calls himself the shepherd. He says humanity has committed the original sin, and he calls himself the savior. Just believe in him and he will save you; this is the ultimate insult to anyone who understands.”\nThat’s why Sekito said, “I would rather suffer eternal hell than ask you the question again. We don’t fit with each other. There is no harmony between my heart and your heart. My journey to you has been futile.”\nIn THE ANTICHRIST, he says many many things. His whole teaching is concerned with the superman. God is dead and man is free to be a superman, now he need not be a slave. Now he can declare his freedom, and in his freedom he will become superman.\nWith God he was just a slave kneeling down before statues and sculptures and scriptures, and praying to God like a beggar, believing in saviors, prophets, messiahs, who were nothing but arch- egoists. The whole humanity has been turned into a great spiritual slavery.\nHe was against Christ because he was telling lies: “Blessed are the poor for they shall inherit the kingdom of God.” This is a lie. He is simply consoling the poor. And to console the poor is to destroy the possible revolution. And that’s what all the Christians are doing. They are protecting capitalism, they are protecting the people who are in power, and they are giving empty words as consolation to the poor: “Blessed are the poor.” Nonsense!\nAnd just to give them a deeper consolation, he condemns the rich. He says, “Even if a camel can pass through the eye of a needle, no rich man will ever pass through the gates of paradise.” This is just to make the poor feel great: their poverty is spiritual, it is a gift of God, they are blessed. These people like Jesus have created poverty, and have destroyed the possibility of revolution, of changing the social structure, of creating a better society without classes, and finally, an ultimate society where the state also withers away.\nPeople like Jesus are not the saviors, but consolers. They are functioning, perhaps not knowingly, as agents of the vested interests. That was the reason why Nietzsche continuously wrote before his signature, “Antichrist”. He was very clear about it. Jesus says, “If someone slaps you on one cheek, you give him your other cheek.” Nietzsche does not accept it, and I agree with Nietzsche, not with Jesus. The reason? Nietzsche gives a perfect argument for it. He said, “If you give your other cheek to the person, you are insulting him. You are telling him, ‘I am holier-than-thou. You are just subhuman.’”\nNobody before Nietzsche has seen that this statement is an insult, that’s why I called him an original man. He just missed one thing: meditation. Otherwise, we would have had a greater buddha than Gautam Buddha himself, because he would have been absolutely contemporary.\nDo you understand what he is saying? When you give your other cheek you are rejecting the man, his humanity. You are saying, “I am a saint, and you are just an ordinary human being.” Nietzsche says, “When somebody hits you on the cheek, hit him, as hard as you can. That makes you equal.” You accept the man’s dignity as a human being, and you also say, “I am also a human being, I am not superior to you, I am not holier than you.” A strange argument, but absolutely perfect.\nIn this book, THE ANTICHRIST, he says, “People who still believe in themselves still have their own God.” Now they have become gods themselves. But he does not know anything about meditation, that is the difficulty.\nIn meditation you enter as if you are a self, but the deeper you go, the more the self starts withering away. When you finally reach your center you are no more. The question of being a god does not arise. You are certainly godly, because the whole existence is godly. But it is not a power trip, because a power trip needs others to be lower than you and you to be higher.\nIn deep meditation you know that even trees are equal to you, that even animals and birds and rocks are equal to you. The whole existence lives in tremendous equality. That’s what I have been saying again and again. Only a spiritual, meditative person can be authentically communist and anarchist, nobody else, because as you go deeper into yourself you disappear, you are no more. So there is no question of any power trip, any ego number. And the whole existence suddenly becomes just as you are.\nThe ego is absent, the “I” is absent; there is only a presence of light, of consciousness, of witnessing. And the whole existence seems to be as silent as you are, as ecstatic as you are. There is no higher, no lower. Both the movements – the movement of communism and the movement of anarchism – have failed in a way, because they missed the basic point of equality.\nOnly a meditator knows everything is equal, because we are all part of one organic cosmos. Different shapes and different forms create the beauty because they create variety. But deep down in the roots is the same juice; it is the same nourishment that is flowing in the tree, that is becoming a flower, that is flowing in you and becoming a buddha. Your unfoldment into a buddha is exactly the unfoldment of a lotus flower, there is no difference at all. Nobody is higher, nobody is lower.\nNietzsche is right. If people are not meditative and they drop the idea of God, they themselves will become gods, because who will prevent them from becoming gods? Their egos will become absolutely inflated, they will become more and more egoist. When God was there, they were humble, they were afraid of punishment, of hell. Now there is no God – who is going to prevent them from becoming great egos?\nOnce somebody objected to Napoleon Bonaparte, “What you are doing goes against the constitution of the country. Napoleon said,”I am the law. Throw away the constitution. Whatever I say is the constitution.” Now this is bound to happen. The egoists become the very law. Egoist people become gods.\nHirohito has died in Japan. The second world war was such a shock to the Japanese people not because of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but because of the defeat of the Sun God. They believed that their emperor was a sun god, he was not a human being, he could not be defeated. Because he was never defeated the concept continued and became more and more ingrained: “He cannot be defeated, there is no power which can defeat him, he is no more a human being, he is a god, a sun god.” But all great kings and emperors have believed that they share power with God. If there is no God, your kings, your emperors, the people who have power will start thinking, “We are gods and everybody else is just an ordinary human being.”\nSo he is right. If you are not acquainted with meditation, mind is a dangerous phenomenon. Without God, it can become very inflated. It can start thinking about itself as being the God.\nI am reminded of a beautiful incident. It happened in Baghdad, a Mohammedan capital, in the times of a certain Caliph Omar. A man declared that he has come with a new message from God, and it is a great improvement on the Holy Koran.\nHe was immediately caught and brought to Caliph Omar, to his court. “This man is proclaiming that he comes from God and has brought a new message to humanity, more refined than Mohammed’s Holy Koran.” Mohammedans cannot accept any refinement on the Holy Koran, that is the last word of God.\nEvery religion says so. Mahavir is the last word, nothing can be changed, nothing can be refined. So is the Buddha the last word for the Buddhists. So is Jesus, so is Moses, every founder in the world has tried that. “I am the final full stop. Everything stops with me; no more evolution.” But evolution does not care about these people, it goes on and on.\nOmar was very angry. He said, “You are a Mohammedan and you are claiming that you are a better prophet than Mohammed?”\nHe said, “Of course, because I come after so many centuries. The world has changed, the time has changed, it needs a new Holy Koran. I have brought it.”\nOmar was very angry. He told his soldiers, “Give him good treatment. Bind him naked to a pillar in the prison and beat him for seven days. Don’t allow him to sleep, and no food. And after seven days I will come and see whether he has changed his mind or not.”\nHe was tortured for seven days continuously: no sleep, no food, and continuous beating. When on the seventh day Omar went to the jail, the man was simply full of blood, the whole body was oozing blood.\nOmar asked, “What do you think now? Have you changed your mind or not?”\nThe man laughed. He said, “When I was coming from paradise taking the new message to humanity, God told me that I would be tortured. Every prophet has been tortured. These seven days have proved completely that I am the prophet. God was right.”\nOmar could not believe his ears. And at that moment suddenly from another pillar came the voice of a man who had been brought one month before. He used to declare, “I am God himself!” So he had been tortured in the jail – for one month. Omar had completely forgotten him – he had become interested in this prophet – but the man suddenly shouted, “Omar! Beware! After Mohammed I have never sent any prophet to the world! This man is lying! I am God!”\nWhat to do with these people? They are just insane.\nNo psychoanalyst can say that Jesus was sane if he is true to his scientific analysis and scientific approach. The man is calling himself ‘the son of God’. He needs hospitalization, he does not need crucifixion. That is absolutely wrong. He has not committed any crime, he is simply declaring his insanity. And you don’t put insane people on the cross, you have compassion on them, they need psychiatric treatment. But unfortunately there was no psychiatry and no psychology. It was waiting for another Jew, Sigmund Freud, to invent it. But he came too late, two thousand years after the first Jew, Jesus, was crucified.\nIt is really megalomania. If God is not there, there is every possibility that anybody who has an egoistic mind will move to the other extreme. First he was kneeling down before God. Now knowing there is no God, he moves to the other extreme. Now he declares, “I am God.” God has to be there.\nBut this is the experience of one who only knows the mind and not anything beyond it. As you move beyond the mind, you are no more. There is no one to declare, “I am the son of God,” or, “I am God.” There is no one to declare, “I am the savior of mankind,” or, “I am a prophet,” or, “I am the reincarnation of God.” All these people are simply insane. And you have been worshipping insane people because they declared themselves to be God. All these so-called founders of religion needed psychiatric treatment.\nThere are still people... When Jawaharlal Nehru was the first prime minister of India, there were at least one dozen people all over India who believed they were Jawaharlal Nehru. One person I knew, because he used to live in a nearby town, and I used to go there once in a while to lecture in that town’s college. And there I met him, because he had come to the lecture. And the principal laughingly introduced him to me, “Here is Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, our prime minister.” And he was dressed exactly like Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.\nI said, “He looks like Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.” The man said, “Looks like? I am!”\nAnd the principal later on told me that this man goes on sending telegrams to government circuit houses that the prime minister is coming on such and such date, so keep the best room for him. He will be staying for two days. And inform all the officials. And many times he has deceived people, because in a small village nobody knows Jawaharlal Nehru directly. They have only seen his pictures, and that man was completely dressed like him. He had the same hairstyle, the same cap, the same baskit, the same Mohammedan-style pajama – everything perfect. And, because of his mind perhaps, his face was also becoming similar to Jawaharlal Nehru. He believed it absolutely, there was no doubt about it. He behaved the way Jawaharlal behaved, he walked the way Jawaharlal walked. But he was never caught because he died in a car accident.\nOne man, who used to think that he was Jawaharlal Nehru, was in the biggest madhouse in India, in Raibareli. After three years there he finally recognized that he was not Nehru, perhaps because of the torture, or the continuous hammering on his mind, “You are not.” He became tired, that’s my feeling; and what happened later on proves my feeling right.\nJawaharlal Nehru was going to come to Raibareli for some celebration, and was going to come to the madhouse also, to open a new wing which had been newly constructed for more mad people to be accommodated. So the officers thought now that the man was cured, it would be good to give him a release from Jawaharlal’s own hands.\nWhen Jawaharlal came, they brought the madman. They introduced him, “This is Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, our prime minister.”\nThe man looked at Jawaharlal Nehru, and he said, “Don’t be worried. It will take three years at least. I used to think exactly the same as you think, but these people are such torturers. Finally I had to accept that I am not, although I know I am. In three years’ time you will also accept you are not. Just go in. I am going out, you go in! Don’t be worried, it takes only three years to be cured.”\nJawaharlal could not understand what to do with this man, who was perfectly logical. He used to think he was Jawaharlal, then these people had cured him by torturing him. But deep down he still knew who he was.\nIt happened in England when Churchill was the prime minister... Because of the second world war, in London after six o’clock there was a very strict curfew. Nobody should be seen outside their houses, otherwise they might be shot.\nChurchill used to go for an evening walk. And that day there was such a beautiful sunset... very rare in England, where the sun appears only once in a while. So he went on sitting on a park bench\nwatching the beautiful sunset, and he forgot about the curfew. Suddenly as the sun went down beneath the horizon he realized that he was late. It was already past the time when he should have been inside the house, which was still at least a mile away. And the strict orders, his orders, were that everybody had to be in their house after six o’clock. He would be shot. He looked to see where he could enter – anybody would give him shelter knowing that he was Winston Churchill, our prime minister, our savior.\nSo he knocked on the first house, which happened to be a madhouse. A man opened the door, and Churchill said, “I am sorry to disturb you. I am Winston Churchill, you must know about me, I am the prime minister of England.” The man simply grabbed him. Churchill said, “What are you doing?”\nThe man said, “Shut up! There are already six Winston Churchills here. Come in!” He said, “I tell you, I am REALLY Winston Churchill.”\nHe said, “Don’t say anything, they all say the same thing. I am putting you with the others. You will know who is real.”\nThere was no way to go out. There was the danger of being shot dead, it was better to rest in this madhouse. But he was put with those six fat guys, smoking the same kind of cigar as you always saw Churchill smoking. And when the seventh Churchill entered, they all waved to him – (TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF DELIGHTED LAUGHTER, THE MASTER RAISES HIS RIGHT ARM WITH\nTWO FINGERS EXTENDED IN A “V”) – the Victory sign. “Welcome, come in.”\nHe saw this was a strange place... they all looked like him, all fat and puffed-up, and smoking cigars and giving him the Victory sign. He tried hard to convince them, the whole night the discussion went on. He told them, “You people are mad. I am the real...” They all laughed.\nOne of them said, “Everybody here is real. Unreal Churchills don’t exist.” Churchill tried, “Don’t you recognize me?”\nThey said, “Don’t you recognize us? We are very happy to have you. Six were already here, you are the seventh. More will be coming! But all are real! Nobody is unreal.”\nHe spent the whole tortured night with those six Churchills continuously smoking and talking the way Churchill used to talk, about war affairs and plans of how to defeat Hitler. Churchill was silent, “What to do with these idiots?”\nAnd they nagged him, “Why are you sitting silently? If you are the real Churchill come in and discuss with us the problems of the country. The country is in danger and you are sitting silently. And you think you are the real Churchill?”\nChurchill said later on, “Once in a while in the night I had a doubt... these people are so certain, who knows? Maybe I am mad? I am certain, they are also certain, they seem to be more absolutely certain than me. I sometimes had some hesitation, maybe...”\nIn the morning he phoned to parliament, “Send people to convince this jailer.” They were all worried, the whole night he had been searched for all over London. “Where had he gone?” The whole of England was dependent on Churchill’s methodology to defeat Adolf Hitler. “Where has he gone? Is it some conspiracy? Has Adolf Hitler abducted him?”\nSo when he phoned, people immediately came and told the jailer, “You are an idiot. You tortured our prime minister.”\nHe said, “Just come in, and you can see there are seven prime ministers. I am not at fault, they all say the same thing. This man was also saying the same thing. How am I to decide who is real? You come in.”\nAnd when those people came in, they could not believe their eyes. They said, “You are right, we are sorry. But this man is the real Churchill. We are taking him out.” And they were high officials of the parliament, so the jailer agreed.\nThose six others said, “What is the matter? That phony fellow has been taken out. We are the real Churchills – not one, six! – but nobody takes any care...”\nIt has been the experience in many countries. Ego is insane. If there is no God, the egoist can think of himself as God. But this can happen only if you are not acquainted with meditation. Meditation simply dissolves you into the cosmos. You are no more, only existence is.\nIt is time for Sardar Gurudayal Singh.\nA new young priest, Father Fever, has just arrived at the “Holy Saints of Sack-cloth” monastery. After a couple of weeks he is feeling so disturbed by sexual fantasies that he goes to see the father superior, old Father Fornicate, aged ninety-five.\n“Ah, Father,” cries Fever, “I am deeply troubled by impure thoughts, and sexual temptations come crowding into my mind – things like doggie-style and sixty-nine, French ticklers and satin panties with pictures of Jesus on them! The more I try to resist them, the more they crowd into my mind.”\n“Hmm,” says Father Fornicate, adjusting his robe. “So what would you like to know?”\n“Well,” replies Father Fever, perspiring, “you are ninety-five years old and one of the most ancient relics of the church – tell me, how old do you have to be before you are released from the lusts of the flesh?”\n“Hmm,” says Father Fornicate, eyeing the young priest. “It takes many years of self-torture and holy prayer before your mind is cleaned of all such wickedness.”\n“Really?” asks the young priest. “How many years?”\n“Well,” replies old Fornicate with a sigh, “I can tell you that it is more than ninety-five!”\nNewton Hooton gets into Dingle Dilda’s New York taxi to go across town, and finds himself being thrown around inside the car as Dingle races through the streets.\n“Hey! Slow down!” shouts Newton, when he finally manages to catch hold of something, “or you will get us both into the hospital!”\n“You don’t need to worry, mister,” replies Dingle. “I have just got out of the hospital after being there for eighteen months, and I don’t intend going back!”\n“Ah! I am sorry,” says Newton, feeling reassured. “You were in the hospital for eighteen months – that must have been awful! Were you badly injured?”\n“Nope! Not a scratch,” replies Dingle. “It was a mental hospital!”\nPeter Pumper gets onto the famous TV game show, “Primal Passions”, and wins his way to the final round.\n“Okay, Mister Pumper,” says Monty Mount, the emcee, “for the big, sixty-four thousand dollar question, which subject do you choose?”\n“I choose ‘Sexual Techniques,’” replies Peter, excitedly.\n“Good,” shouts Monty, “and in addition, you are allowed to choose any expert to help you answer the questions.”\n“I have brought with me the famous French sexologist, Andre Perverse,” replies Peter Pumper, confidently.\nThe audience gasps with approval.\n“Right!” shouts Monty. “Now enter the soundproof box together, and prepare to answer the big question on sexual techniques. You have exactly one minute to answer. The question is: You are in bed with your mistress, and you have exactly three kisses to arouse her to the max! Where would you place the first kiss?”\n“On the lips!” cries Peter, without a second’s hesitation.\n“CORRECT!” shouts Monty, “And where would you place the second kiss?”\nThere is a pause as Peter thinks for a moment. But then he shouts, “On the back of the neck!” “CORRECT!” shouts Monty. The audience howls with approval.\n“Now,” continues Monty, “for the third and final part of the question – for sixty-four thousand dollars, where would you place the third kiss?”\nPerspiration pours down Peter’s face. He is in trouble as the music plays louder and louder and time ticks away. In desperation, Peter turns to his partner, Andre Perverse, and says, “Andre! You must help me...!”\nBut the Frenchman shakes his head frantically. “Do not ask me, mon ami,” replies Andre. “In my mind you have already been wrong twice!”\nNivedano... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat) Be silent...\nClose your eyes, and feel your bodies to be completely frozen.\nThis is the right moment to turn in. Gather all your energy, your total consciousness, and with an urgency as if this is going to be the last moment of your life, rush towards your very center of being.\nFaster and faster... Deeper and deeper...\nAs you come closer to your very center, a great silence descends over you. It is falling like soft rain. A little more, closer, and a totally new experience...\nFlowers of peace, flowers of serenity, flowers of absolute tranquility are growing all around you.\nJust one step more and you are at the very center of your being, absolutely drunk with the divine, surrounded by an aura of ecstasy. You are facing your original face for the first time. The face of the buddha is just a symbol, it is really everybody’s face, the ultimate face.\nThe only quality the buddha has... all the buddhas, past, present, future are bound to have only one quality – witnessing, awareness.\nJust witness you are not the body. Witness you are not the mind. And witness you are only a witness.\nYou are just a buddha, utterly innocent, beyond mind, a pure space, infinite and eternal. To make your witnessing deeper, Nivedano...\n(Drumbeat) Relax...\nLet go, the same way as the flowers fall down from the trees... with easy heart, no tension, no anxiety. Settled at the center you are in tune with existence, your heartbeat is the heartbeat of the whole universe.\nAt this moment you are the most blessed people on the earth, because there is no other splendor in existence greater than you are in this moment.\nRejoice in this beautiful moment.\nRejoice in this authentic and original experience.\nRejoice that you are so blessed to be so close to existence itself. And gather all these experiences before Nivedano calls you back.\nYou have to bring them from the center to the circumference of your life. You have to live a life of grace, beauty, joy, blissfulness, ecstasy – in every moment, around the clock.\nWhether awake or asleep you are the buddha and all that belongs to the buddha – the witnessing, the ecstasy, the rejoicing, the blissfulness, the utter drunkenness that comes to you. When you reach to your center you have reached to the very center of existence.\nYou are drowned in the juices of life, and nourished.\nCollect all this experience and remember that you have to persuade the buddha to come with you.\nThese are the three steps of meditation: first the buddha comes behind you as a shadow. But the shadow is fragrant, the shadow has tremendous solidity, the shadow is not a shadow but a presence – very tangible, you can touch it, you can feel it. It is almost behind you; its warmth, its compassion, its light will all be showering on you.\nThe second step: you become the shadow, and buddha comes in front of you. Your shadow slowly slowly fades away, because your personality is nothing but a false idea, an imagination, a fiction, a lie.\nAnd as your shadow disappears your being becomes one with the buddha. That is the third and the final step.\nThe moment you become the buddha, you have come back home. That day will be the most fortunate day of all your lives. You have lived for many lives, in many ways, in many bodies, and you have been missing and missing and missing. This time, make it clear to yourself you are not going to miss: you have to become enlightened, you have to achieve the highest peak and the deepest depth of your being.\nThis is the very purpose of me calling your hidden secret, your hidden splendor, to the surface. God is dead, now only Zen is the living truth.\nNivedano... (Drumbeat)\nCome back... but very slowly, very peacefully, very silently, as if there is no one in the auditorium.\nJust sit silently for a few seconds to remember the path you have followed, to remember all that great space, those beautiful moments when your heart was in tune with the heart of the universe, those few rare moments when your whole life was eternal.\nAnd feel the buddha, his warmth, his compassion, his presence. It is just behind you.\nThe day is not far away when you will take the second step and you will take the third step. These ten thousand people are going to become ten thousand buddhas in their own right. Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Beloved Master.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"13943","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/god_is_dead_now_zen_is_the_only_living_truth/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/god_is_dead_now_zen_is_the_only_living_truth/>God is Dead, Now Zen is the Only Living Truth</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">2 God is an insult to man</h1><div class=post-meta>66 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;13943 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/God_is_Dead_Now_Zen_is_the_Only_Living_Truth/part2.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

“NOW YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE PRECEPTS, YOU WANT TO LEARN THE VINAYA, DON’T
YOU?”</p><p><br></p><p>SEKITO REPLIED, “THERE’S NO NEED TO LEARN THE VINAYA.” SEIGEN ASKED,
“THEN, YOU WANT TO READ THE BOOK OF SHEELA?”</p><p>SEKITO REPLIED, “THERE’S NO NEED TO READ THE BOOK OF SHEELA.” SEIGEN
ASKED, “CAN YOU DELIVER A LETTER TO NANGAKU OSHO?” SEKITO SAID,
“CERTAINLY.”</p><p>SEIGEN SAID, “GO NOW, AND COME BACK QUICKLY. IF YOU COME BACK EVEN A
LITTLE LATE, YOU WILL MISS ME. IF YOU MISS ME, YOU CANNOT GET THE BIG
HATCHET UNDER MY CHAIR.”</p><p><br></p><p>SOON SEKITO REACHED NANGAKU. BEFORE HANDING OVER THE LETTER, SEKITO
MADE A BOW AND ASKED, “OSHO, WHEN ONE NEITHER FOLLOWS THE OLD SAINTS NOR
EXPRESSES ONE’S INNERMOST SOUL, WHAT WILL ONE DO?”</p><p>NANGAKU SAID, “YOUR QUESTION IS TOO ARROGANT. WHY DON’T YOU ASK
MODESTLY?” TO WHICH SEKITO REPLIED, “THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SINK
INTO HELL ETERNALLY AND NOT EVER HOPE FOR THE LIBERATION THAT THE OLD
SAINTS KNOW.”</p><p><br></p><p>SEKITO, FINDING THAT HE AND NANGAKU WERE NOT ATTUNED TO EACH OTHER,
SOON LEFT FOR SEIGEN WITHOUT GIVING NANGAKU THE LETTER. ON HIS ARRIVAL,
SEIGEN ASKED, “DID THEY ENTRUST SOMETHING TO YOU?”</p><p><br></p><p>SEKITO SAID, “THEY DIDN’T ENTRUST ANYTHING TO ME.” SEIGEN SAID, “BUT
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A REPLY.”</p><p>SEKITO SAID, “IF THEY DON’T ENTRUST ANYTHING, THERE IS NO REPLY.”
THEN HE SAID, “WHEN I WAS LEAVING HERE, YOU ADDED THAT I SHOULD COME
BACK SOON TO RECEIVE THE BIG HATCHET UNDER THE CHAIR. NOW I HAVE COME
BACK, PLEASE GIVE ME THE BIG HATCHET.”</p><p><br></p><p>SEIGEN WAS SILENT. SEKITO BOWED DOWN AND RETIRED.</p><p><br></p><p>Friends, before I answer your questions, I have to answer two letters
by very knowledgeable idiots. This distinction has to be remembered.
There is a certain ignorance that knows, and there is a certain
knowledgeability that knows nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>One is a Buddhist scholar, and he writes that “An enlightened man
cannot be concerned with the trivia of the ordinary world and its
concerns.”</p><p><br></p><p>It means, according to him, I am an ignorant man. It is a compliment
to me because every enlightened man finally becomes as ignorant as a
child, or as innocent as a child. Socrates’ last words were, “I don’t
know anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>This man is a scholar but blind. Does he think that a third world war
which is going to erase the whole of humanity is trivia? Does he think
that the explosion of the population in this country is trivia when it
is going to kill almost five hundred million people in the coming ten
years? And if these are trivia then I have to take him back to Gautam
Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>He was concerned that no sannyasin of his should have more than three
pieces of clothes – that is trivia. He was concerned that no sannyasin
of his should wear shoes – that is trivia. He was concerned that no
sannyasin should eat more than one time in a day – that is trivia. And
still he is enlightened and I am ignorant. This is what I call a
knowledgeable idiot.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha has made thirty-three thousand rules for his disciples – all
trivia. Where can you find thirty- three thousand truths? Truth is one
and inexpressible. But he was concerned with absolute trivia.</p><p><br></p><p>One sannyasin was going to spread his message and had come for his
last word, because he might not be coming back to him for two or three
years. And what was his message? “Don’t see a woman.” Now, unless you
see, you cannot decide whether the person is a woman or a man.</p><p>I don’t understand what kind of nonsense Buddha was talking. How are
you going to know that the person coming towards you is a woman? You
have to see first, then you can close your eyes – but you have seen. And
once you have seen a beautiful woman and you close your eyes, she
becomes more beautiful. Is it not trivia?</p><p><br></p><p>And Buddha told him, “You have to keep your eyes just four feet ahead
of you. Just look only four feet ahead and keep your eyes down, so even
if you come across a woman you only see her feet.” This is great
spiritual stuff!</p><p><br></p><p>The man was a little puzzled. He said, “I will try my best, but if by
chance I happen to see a woman accidentally – suddenly a woman comes out
of the forest or on a crossroad – what should I do?”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “If you accidentally see a woman, don’t talk to her.” Is
it great spirituality? Don’t even say, “Hello,” because she is a
woman!</p><p><br></p><p>And the man insisted. He said, “If the woman says something, will it
not be embarrassing to not answer her? Will it not be inhuman?”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “If such a coincidence happens, you can talk to her, but
don’t touch her.” Is this spiritual stuff?</p><p><br></p><p>What do you call trivia? The whole humanity is going to die and I
should not speak!? And your Gautam Buddha is talking absolute nonsense
to his people.</p><p><br></p><p>And the man was intelligent enough. He said, “There may be a
situation in which I have to touch a woman. Perhaps a woman has fallen
in a well, what am I supposed to do? Or in a ditch, what am I supposed
to do? Should I just go on without looking at her miserable state,
without helping her?”</p><p><br></p><p>And Buddha said, “If such a coincidence happens, you can touch. But
remember, all that is outside is illusory.”</p><p><br></p><p>If it is illusory then why make the first point? The woman is
illusory and don’t touch her! What is the problem if you touch an
illusion? Don’t talk to the illusion! Don’t look at the illusion! This I
call absolute trivia.</p><p><br></p><p>These Buddhist scholars are going to provoke me. I will pull down
Gautam Buddha completely!</p><p><br></p><p>My concern for humanity makes me ignorant, and his concern about
women and about clothes and about shoes, and about not touching women,
not looking more than four feet ahead, makes him enlightened! His
enlightenment is rotten! It is a bullock-cart enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>I am a contemporary man, twenty-five centuries ahead of Gautam
Buddha. He is just old hat.</p><p><br></p><p>But these Buddhist scholars are provoking me. I will start talking
about Gautam Buddha and will pull down the whole house that he has
built, because it is built on all these stupid things.</p><p><br></p><p>My concern for humanity is absolutely spiritual. My concern for this
beautiful planet is sacred. It is my compassion and my love. And I don’t
care about any Gautam Buddha. I am a buddha in my own</p><p>right, and your old Buddha is too out of date. I belong to my time,
and I speak the language of my time.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha was afraid to allow women in his commune. For twenty years
continuously he refused women. What was the fear? He did not trust his
own sannyasins; this was distrust. A master distrusting his own people?
He was afraid that if women enter into the commune, then what will
happen to the celibacy of the monks? But if their celibacy is so thin
that the entry of a woman is going to disturb their celibacy, it is not
much of a celibacy.</p><p><br></p><p>They must have been homosexuals, as we are finding now in every
monastery around the world that all kinds of sexual perversions are
practiced. It cannot have been otherwise for Buddha’s disciples. Only my
people are living a natural, sacred, existential life, not against the
current, not against the universe.</p><p><br></p><p>And without listening to me, without reading me, these idiots go on
making their comments.</p><p><br></p><p>My whole effort is to bring materialism and spiritualism into
balance. To me the outside world is as real as the inside world.
Naturally this creates trouble for me from both sides. The communists
have written books against me, for the reason that I am teaching
spirituality and meditation and diverting people from their real
concern, a classless society. And I am making people selfish because I
am just telling them to go in.</p><p><br></p><p>And the spiritualists are against me; they have written books against
me, and articles, and every day there are letters. Their problem is that
I am taking too much interest in the world. A man of real spirituality
should close his eyes, because the world is illusory.</p><p><br></p><p>But none of your so-called and self-styled enlightened people have
taken the trouble to think twice. When you say the world is illusory,
then there is no need to renounce it. Nobody renounces dreams. Do you
renounce your dream when you wake up in the morning? A dream is just a
dream, there is no question of renouncing it. And if you are having a
sweet dream, I say enjoy it.</p><p><br></p><p>Make this whole world a sweet dream, not a nightmare. All your
politicians and all your priests are trying to make it a nightmare. Then
naturally people think to renounce it, it is such a tragedy.</p><p><br></p><p>But I am not in favor of renouncing the world, and I don’t say that
the world is illusory; otherwise, why does Buddha go on begging every
day? If the world is illusory why are you going to beg before an
illusory house? And when a woman gives you food, she is illusory and the
food is real?!</p><p><br></p><p>Why do you need three pieces of clothes? This was the criticism of
Mahavira, Buddha’s contemporary, who lived naked. He did not accept
Buddha as enlightened because he did not live naked. Three pieces of
clothes were luxury to Mahavira, a man who lived naked in summer, in
winter, in rain. Naturally he has the right to say to Buddha, “You are
living in great luxury. Three pieces of clothes! You are too
materialistic.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha ate one meal a day; to Mahavira that was luxury. In the twelve
years before Mahavira became enlightened, he ate on only three hundred
and sixty-five days. In twelve years he ate for only one year – not
continuously. Two months passed, and then one day he would eat; three
months</p><p>passed, and one day he would eat. That means, on average, that out of
eleven days he would eat on one day. Of course, to him Buddha is
indulging in luxury. These are relative terms.</p><p><br></p><p>And Buddha was criticizing Mahavira for such trivial things, because
he could not find answers to Mahavira’s criticism that he was living in
luxury – daily food, three pieces of clothes. He found another way to
criticize him, because the followers of Mahavira were saying that
Mahavira is omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, with all the qualities
of God. And Buddha was laughing at Mahavira, telling his disciples,
“This fellow, this guy, says that he is omniscient, all knowing, and I
know him... Once he was begging before a house in which nobody lived.
And he talks about knowing everything: past, present, future, and he
does not know that the house is empty, there is nobody there. For years
it has been empty, and this man is omniscient?</p><p><br></p><p>“And one day he was passing early in the morning, going to the river,
when he stamped on the tail of a dog who was fast asleep on the road.
When the dog started barking, then he realized. And this man is
omniscient, all knowing, and he does not know that a dog is lying just
in front of him?”</p><p><br></p><p>Do you think these criticisms are very spiritual? Neither are
Mahavira’s criticisms very spiritual, nor are Buddha’s criticisms very
spiritual. Just trivia.</p><p><br></p><p>So I want to tell this Buddhist scholar to consider again who is
enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>The other is also a Buddhist scholar, and he had said to me, “I have
been reading your books on Buddha, and I have appreciated them very
much.” But he never then wrote any letter to me, nor any letter to the
newspapers.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a strange thing: when I was saying things in appreciation,
nobody ever wrote a single word. They thought what I was saying was
really the meaning of Buddha’s sutras. It was not! The meaning was given
by me, and I can take it away. I can tear down all your scriptures point
by point!</p><p><br></p><p>Now he has published a letter in the newspapers. Now he says, that I
cannot have samadhi – enlightenment – because I don’t have sheel, I have
only pragya. He does not understand at all – neither Buddha nor me.
Pragya is a by-product of samadhi, of enlightenment. Pragya means
wisdom. Unless you become enlightened, you cannot have wisdom, you can
have only knowledge. And pragya does not mean knowledge, it means
wisdom. It is a by-product of samadhi, enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>But he has no experience of samadhi, he has just seen the scriptures.
And you will see in the coming sutra, an authentic seeker simply denies
that he has anything to do with sheel. Sheel means character. Now he is
concerned with my character, saying that without character you cannot
become enlightened. What does he know about my character? And has he
ever thought about the character of Buddha?</p><p><br></p><p>For twenty-nine years continuously Buddha was indulging in sex, and
not only with his wife, he had many concubines. His father was told when
he was born that either he would become a world emperor, or he would
renounce the world and become an enlightened one. These were the two
alternatives. Of course his father wanted him to become a world
emperor.</p><p>So he asked how to prevent him from becoming enlightened. “I want him
to become the world emperor.” He was a small king in a small kingdom.
Arun has just brought from Nepal a picture of the palace – which is in
ruins – where Buddha was born. Even in ruins you can see the kingdom was
not great. The palace looks like just an ordinary big house. And it was
in just a small village on the border of Nepal and India. Naturally his
father must have had the ambition of Buddha becoming a great world
conqueror.</p><p><br></p><p>And the astrologers suggested, “If you want him to be prevented from
enlightenment, then make every comfort and luxury possible for him. He
should grow up in luxury and indulgence. He should not see anybody old,
anybody dead. Even the flowers which are going to fall down should be
removed before he sees them. All pale leaves which are going to fall
should be removed.</p><p><br></p><p>“And he should be made to live in different palaces in different
seasons, so he never comes to feel any season is a trouble. So three
palaces were made in different places: one for the summer, one for the
winter, one for the rain. And great gardens were created around the
palaces. And his father collected all the beautiful girls from the
kingdom, to be his concubines. He was surrounded with women, music, wine
for twenty-nine years, and he had a wife and a son. And he became
enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t have a son, I don’t have a wife, I don’t have concubines, I
don’t even have a girlfriend. And I don’t have character? And Buddha has
character! No man has indulged more than Gautam Buddha. What
character...?</p><p><br></p><p>He had five disciples before his enlightenment. They were disciples
because he was an ascetic. He was torturing himself fasting and had
become just a skeleton. And these five disciples were immensely
impressed by his self-torture. The whole of humanity lives with this
idea: if you torture yourself you are a saint.</p><p><br></p><p>The day he became enlightened, he dropped all self-torture; it was
absolutely useless. All the five disciples left him immediately: he has
fallen, fallen from saintliness. He had become enlightened, and those
five disciples who had been with him for many years, respecting him as a
great saint, just left him, saying, “He has fallen. He has started
eating, he has started having warm clothes.”</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps these Buddhist scholars don’t understand anything at all
except the scriptures.</p><p><br></p><p>Character arises out of enlightenment, it is not vice versa. It is
not character that produces enlightenment, otherwise enlightenment would
have a cause to it. Enlightenment is your nature; it has no cause. It is
already there, you just have to discover it. It does not matter what
kind of character you have. If you go inwards the sinner will find the
buddha just as much as the saint. And after you have found your
enlightenment, the radiation of the enlightenment becomes your
character, your sheel.</p><p><br></p><p>Your enlightenment becomes your innocence, and out of that innocence
arises wisdom. But wisdom is not knowledge, it is simply transparent
clarity about everything, inner or outer.</p><p><br></p><p>But these knowledgeable idiots simply prove one thing that I have
been continuously telling you: don’t get involved in scholarship, don’t
get involved in knowledgeability. That is the greatest barrier to
enlightenment, because you are so full of knowledge, and all knowledge
is of the mind.</p><p>Enlightenment is not of the mind, it is the fragrance of no-mind.
No-mind is not based on any character. Just the contrary: all character
arises out of the clarity of no-mind. So it is not imposed from outside
as a discipline. It arises as a spontaneous response. You simply cannot
do any evil. It is not a question of your deciding not to do evil, you
simply cannot do it. You are so full of light, how can you behave like a
blind man? You are so full of light, how can you behave like a man
stumbling in darkness?</p><p><br></p><p>So character arises, wisdom arises, and a thousand other things:
blissfulness, ecstasy, benediction, compassion. There is no end; more
and more flowers go on flowering.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is the difficulty of the knowledgeable person. He has
accepted a certain fixed formula.</p><p><br></p><p>I want you to know absolutely clearly that just as everything goes on
expanding and growing, even enlightenment becomes clearer, deeper,
higher as time passes. After twenty-five centuries, I am not going to be
a replica of Gautam Buddha. I have nothing to learn from him. If
anything has to be, he has to learn something from me. Twenty-five
centuries have not been a mere wastage. Just as everything is
progressing and evolving, so is consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>But every scholar gets completely fucked-up! He thinks only in terms
of his scripture, and the scripture is twenty-five centuries old. I am a
contemporary man, and I do not belong to any category. I am a category
in myself. I decide according to my spontaneous response, not according
to any commandments, not according to any discipline. Whether the
discipline is given by Buddha or Mahavira or Christ or Krishna, it does
not matter; they are all old. But these people are living in the
past.</p><p><br></p><p>I am moving moment to moment into the future. I have left Gautam
Buddha twenty-five centuries behind. His enlightenment also is
twenty-five centuries old. So much dust has gathered on it. But my
mirror of consciousness is absolutely fresh, and I am not going to
listen to anybody. Nobody is my master! And nobody has the right to tell
me what character is and what is wisdom and what is enlightenment.
Nobody has that right.</p><p><br></p><p>I am a man absolutely free. I live my life according to my own light.
I am nobody’s follower, and I don’t live my life according to any
scripture. These idiots should shut up! Because of them I will be
provoked to condemn Buddha and Mahavira and Krishna and everybody! And
they won’t have any argument against me.</p><p><br></p><p>How can these people say that Buddha was not concerned with trivia?
He was concerned. And my concern is not trivia.</p><p><br></p><p>My concern is a third world war that is hanging just on the horizon.
Any moment there will be no life on earth, and no possibility of any
buddha! And you call it trivia?</p><p><br></p><p>Beware of scholars. They are the most idiotic people in the world.
Your questions.</p><p>Question 1</p><p>The first question:</p><p><br></p><p>GOD IS DEAD, BUT THAT CREATES THE QUESTION: WHO BEGAN THIS
UNIVERSE?</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need for anybody to begin it, because there is no
beginning to this universe, and there is no end.</p><p><br></p><p>This question has been exploited by all the religions, because
everybody wants to know who began the universe, because your minds are
so small they cannot conceive a beginningless universe, an endless
universe, just eternity to eternity. Because you cannot conceive that
vastness, your question arises, “Who created the universe? Who began
it?” But if there was somebody already to begin it, there was a
universe. Do you see the simple arithmetic? If there was somebody
already to begin it, then you cannot call it the beginning, somebody was
already there.</p><p><br></p><p>If you think that God is a necessary thing... it gives you
consolation that God created the world, so you have a beginning. But who
created God? Again you fall into the same problem.</p><p><br></p><p>And all the religions have said that God exists eternally, there is
no creator of God. If that is true for God, why is it not true for
existence itself? It is autonomous, it exists on its own. There is no
need of any creator because that creator will require another creator,
and you will fall into an absurd regress. You can go from A to Z. But
who created Z? The question remains standing, you simply go on pushing.
But the question is not solved because you have asked a wrong
question.</p><p><br></p><p>The universe has no beginning, it is not a creation by anybody. It
has no end. And remember, if it had any beginning, then there would
certainly be an end. Every beginning is a beginning of an end. Every
birth is the beginning of death. So it is good. Get rid of God, because
if he can create the world he can destroy the world. And any world that
is created is bound to be destroyed sooner or later. If there is birth,
there is death. Only a beginningless universe can be endless.</p><p><br></p><p>So your problem is just because the capacity of the mind is very
limited. That’s why I want you to go beyond mind. Only no-mind can
conceive the beginningless, the endless; the incomprehensible becomes
absolutely clear. There is no problem at all. Those who have risen
beyond mind have also risen beyond God simultaneously. God is a need for
the mind, because the mind cannot conceive infinite, eternal things. It
can only conceive very limited things. The question arises because of
your mind’s incapacity, its impotence.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask, “God is dead, but that creates the question, ‘Who began this
universe?’”</p><p><br></p><p>But have you ever thought that God will not solve the question? On
the contrary, the question will be pushed a step back: who created God?
Any hypothesis that does not destroy the question is absolutely useless.
Any answer that keeps on pushing the question further back but does not
touch it at all, is not the answer.</p><p><br></p><p>The only answer you will find is in your own experience of eternity.
Then you will know nobody has created it. It has no beginning, no end.
You don’t have any beginning, you don’t have any end. When you
experience it within your own self, you know existence is autonomous, it
is not created.</p><p>A created thing cannot be more than a mechanism; it cannot be an
organic reality. A car is created, man is not created. If man is also
created he becomes a mechanism, a robot. You can dismantle a car, take
all the parts apart – the wheels and everything – and you can put them
back and the car will be perfectly okay. But cut a man into pieces and
then join them together – with German glue! – still the man will not be
back. An organic phenomenon cannot be dissected. The moment you dissect
it, its very mystery disappears. Then you can join those parts, but you
will have only a corpse, not a living human being.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the dignity of existence that it is not created. It is the
dignity of man that he is not created. God is an insult to existence, to
man, to consciousness, to everything! God is a humiliation. God is not a
solution for any problem. In fact, he creates more problems in the world
and he does not solve anything.</p><p><br></p><p>There are three hundred religions in the world and all are fighting
with each other. These are all created because of the concept of God,
because they have all invented their own concepts.</p><p><br></p><p>The Hindu god has three heads. Just think of the poor fellow. Imagine
you have three heads. I don’t think you will be able to stand up. One
head will be falling this side, one head will be falling that side, this
head will be falling this side, the very weight... I have seen the
statues and the pictures of the Hindu god. His whole body seems to be
just like a man; it cannot manage three heads.</p><p><br></p><p>I have seen children in circuses who are freaks of nature. I have
seen children with two heads, but they cannot even sit; they are just
lying down. The circus is enjoying their tragedy, earning money...</p><p><br></p><p>One man had gone to see a circus, and there was a three-headed child
in the circus. The man was very much concerned because all his children
– he had twenty children, four wives, he was a Mohammedan... The fee was
one rupee per person, and every child of his insisted on seeing. There
was great trouble. The father was trying to convince them, “We don’t
have twenty rupees. I can stay out, and I can send you, but we don’t
have twenty rupees.”</p><p><br></p><p>The owner of the child, who was distributing tickets, heard all this
argument between the children and the father. He said, “Wait. I will
give you twenty rupees. Let me bring the child with three heads. He can
see you are a bigger phenomenon! One man with twenty children.” And he
brought the child in a trolley to look at this man who had twenty
children. And he gave him twenty rupees as a fee, because, “This boy
also needs some entertainment. He gives entertainment to thousands of
people.”</p><p><br></p><p>But that boy could not see from any of his three faces and six eyes.
It was difficult for him even to turn in the trolley. The Hindu god must
be living in a trolley. One head will always be pushing against the
pillow, breathing will be difficult. And walking is out of the
question.</p><p><br></p><p>And all three gods, who have one body, have three wives. Just see the
tragedy. Each god is joined with two other gods, and each god has a
separate wife. Three wives to one man, because the sexual machinery is
only one. I have never heard that the Indian god has three sexual
machineries. Now, I cannot figure out how things are managed.</p><p><br></p><p>These fictions create three hundred religions, because everybody is
free to have his own fiction. Why borrow anybody else’s fiction? There
are religions which think that god has one thousand</p><p>hands. One thousand hands? They must be growing all over the body
just like branches in a tree. And I don’t think he can manage to do
anything. One thousand hands? From the back they will be growing
backwards, from the front they will be growing... there will be no space
left for anything else!</p><p><br></p><p>And there are gods which have one thousand eyes! I cannot conceive
it. Even with no-mind I cannot conceive it. One thousand eyes in one
head? Then there is no possibility for ears, no possibility for the
nose, no possibility for the mouth, no possibility for anything – not
even hair. He must be bald-headed, with eyes all over the head. Even
then I don’t think he can manage one thousand eyes. How will he move?
According to which eye will he see? Even if he winks at a woman, which
eye? One thousand eyes winking at one woman! That will be real
romance!</p><p><br></p><p>God has not solved any problem, God has created thousands of
problems. And every religion has its own idea, because it is a fiction.
You don’t have different ideas about the sun. You don’t have different
ideas about the rose. You can have only different ideas about a fiction.
It is then up to you, whichever way you want.</p><p><br></p><p>The Bible says God created man in his own image. The reality is just
the opposite: man has created God in his own image. And he has been
trying to refine the image of God, finding explanations for all kinds of
absurdities. He needs one thousand hands because he has to care for five
billion people. But if you have to care about five billion people, you
need five billion hands. One thousand hands won’t do. At least, if you
want even to shake hands with the whole of humanity, you will need five
billion hands. Just hands and hands and nothing else! And you go on
shaking and nobody is there!</p><p><br></p><p>They go on finding explanations: he has one thousand eyes because he
has to look after the whole universe. Can’t he move his head, just the
way I am moving mine? I can see ten thousand people without any
difficulty, just with two eyes. Does he not move backwards and go in
reverse? He has eyes all over his head, so when he wants to go
backwards, the front eyes are closed, the backward eyes are open. When
he wants to go sideways, three sides are closed, the right side is open.
Is it a god or some kind of toy to entertain children?</p><p><br></p><p>The very idea of God is because our mind cannot comprehend eternity.
Once you rise beyond your limited mind to an unlimited no-mind, you can
conceive all that was inconceivable before. No God is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>IS THERE ANY PLACE FOR PRAYER IN RELIGION IF THERE IS NO GOD?</p><p><br></p><p>There is no place for prayer, because prayer is God-oriented. If
there is no God, to whom can you pray? All prayers are false because
there is nobody to answer them, nobody to hear them. All prayers are
humiliations, insults, degradations. All prayers are disgusting! You are
kneeling down to a fiction which does not exist.</p><p><br></p><p>And what are you doing in your prayers? Begging. “Give me this, give
me that” – utterly beggarly – “God, give me my daily bread!” Can’t you
ask once for all? Every day? And five billion people asking,</p><p>and only one person listening? Do you think he will remain sane?
“Give me my daily bread?” Why not ask for the whole life and be
finished? One prayer will do.</p><p><br></p><p>But every day bothering him, nagging him like a wife, morning and
evening. And there are Mohammedans who do five prayers a day. They are
the great naggers.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to go to take meditation camps in Udaipur. It was a long
journey from the place I used to live, Jabalpur. Thirty-six hours,
because there was no plane at that time. In Jabalpur there was an
airport, but it was a military airport, and they were not allowed to
open it for the public. Now it is opened.</p><p><br></p><p>So I had to go in a train and change at many junctions. First, I
would have to change at Katni, then I would have to change at Bina, then
I would have to change at Agra. Then I would have to change at
Chittaurgarh, and finally I would reach Udaipur. It was evening time
when the train reached Chittaurgarh. And Ajmer is very close to
Chittaurgarh. Ajmer is one of the strongholds of the Mohammedans, so in
the train there were many Mohammedans. And the train had to stay for one
hour for some other train to come which was bringing passengers for this
train also, to go on to Udaipur.</p><p><br></p><p>So for one hour I used to walk on the platform. All the Mohammedans
lining the platform were sitting in prayer, and I was enjoying them. I
would just go near somebody and say, “The train is leaving,” and he
would jump up. And then he would be angry at me, “You disturbed my
prayer.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I did not disturb anybody’s prayer. I am simply doing my
prayer. This is my heartfelt desire that the train should leave! I was
not talking to you. I don’t even know your name!”</p><p><br></p><p>He would say, “This is strange... in the middle of my prayer?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It was not prayer because I was watching, you have been
looking again and again at the train.” He said, “That is true.”</p><p><br></p><p>And it was the same all over the platform. I would go to a few people
further up and just whisper, “The train is leaving,” and again another
person would jump up and would be very angry: “What kind of person are
you? You look religious, and you disturb people in their prayer?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am not disturbing anybody. I am just praying to God that
the train should leave now.”</p><p><br></p><p>What are your prayers? Begging this, begging that, your prayer
reduces you into a beggar. Meditation transforms you into an emperor.
There is nobody to hear your prayers, there is nobody to answer your
prayers. All religions go on making you extrovert so that you don’t turn
inwards. Prayer is an extrovert thing: God is there, and you are
shouting to that God. But it is taking you away from yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Every prayer is irreligious.</p><p><br></p><p>I have told you the beautiful story by Leo Tolstoy.</p><p>The archbishop of the old Orthodox Church of Russia – it is a story
set before the revolution – became very much worried when many people
from his congregation started going towards a lake. There were three
villagers on a small island in the lake who sat under a tree, with
thousands of people who thought they were saints.</p><p><br></p><p>In Christianity you cannot be a saint on your own account. The word
saint comes from sanction. You have to be sanctioned by the church that
you are a saint; it is a certificate. It is such an ugly idea that the
church can give you a certificate that you are a saint. Even a man like
Francis of Assisi, a beautiful man, was summoned by the pope: “People
have started worshipping you like a saint, and you don’t have any
certificate.”</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s where I feel Francis missed the point. He should have
refused, but he knelt just like a Christian and asked the pope, “Give me
the certificate.” Otherwise he was a nice man, a beautiful man, but I
don’t mention his name because he acted in a very stupid way. This is
not the way of a saint.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t need anybody’s certificate for my enlightenment or for my
buddhahood. I declare it! I don’t need anybody’s certificate. Who can
give me the certificate? Even Gautam Buddha cannot give me the
certificate. Who gave him a certificate?</p><p><br></p><p>But the idea of ‘saint’ in English is very wrong. It comes from
sanctus.</p><p><br></p><p>So the archbishop of Russia was very angry: “Who are these saints? I
have not certified anybody in years. Where have these saints suddenly
arrived from?” But people were going and the church was becoming more
and more empty every day.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally he decided to go and see who these people were. So he took a
motorboat and went to the island. And those three villagers... they were
uneducated, simple people, utterly innocent, and the archbishop was a
powerful man; next to the czar he was the most powerful man in Russia.
He was very angry at those three villagers and told them, “Who made you
saints?”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at each other. They said, “Nobody. And we don’t think we
are saints, we are poor people.”</p><p><br></p><p>“But why are so many people coming here?” They said, “You have to ask
them.”</p><p>He said, “Do you know the orthodox prayer of the church?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “We are uneducated and the prayer is too long, we cannot
remember it.” “So what prayer do you say?”</p><p>They all looked at each other. “You tell him,” said one.</p><p><br></p><p>“You tell him,” said another. They were feeling embarrassed.</p><p>But the archbishop became more and more arrogant, seeing that these
were absolute idiots, “They don’t even know the prayer. How can they be
saints?” So he said, “Anybody can tell me. Just say it!”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “We are feeling very embarrassed because we have made our
own prayer, not knowing the authorized prayer of the church. We have
made our own prayer, very simple it is. Please forgive us that we did
not ask your permission, but we were feeling so embarrassed we did not
come.</p><p><br></p><p>“Our prayer is – God is three and we are also three, so we have made
a prayer – ‘You are three and we are three, have mercy on us.’ This is
our prayer.”</p><p><br></p><p>The archbishop was very angry: “This is no prayer. I have never heard
this kind of thing.” He started laughing.</p><p><br></p><p>Those poor fellows said, “You teach us what the real prayer is. We
thought it was perfectly alright: God is three, we are three, and what
more is needed? Just have mercy on us.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he told them the orthodox prayer, which was a long prayer. By the
time he ended, they said, “We have forgotten the beginning.” So he told
the beginning again. Then they said, “We have forgotten the end.”</p><p><br></p><p>The archbishop was getting angry and irritated. He said, “What kind
of people are you? Can’t you remember a simple prayer?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “It is too long and we are uneducated, and such big words.
We cannot... You just be patient with us. If you repeat it two or three
times perhaps we will get the knack of it.” So he repeated it three
times. They said, “Okay, we will try, but we are afraid that it may not
be the complete prayer... some things may be missing... but we will
try.”</p><p><br></p><p>The arrogant archbishop was very much satisfied that he had finished
these three saints and he could tell his people, “They are idiots. Why
are you going there?” And he left in the boat.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly he saw that behind his boat those three people were running
on the water, coming after him. He could not believe his eyes; he rubbed
his eyes. By that time they had reached the side of his boat, standing
on the water. And they said, “Just one time more, we forgot.”</p><p><br></p><p>But seeing the situation: “These people are walking on water and I am
going in the motorboat,” he said, “You continue your prayer. Don’t
bother about what I have said to you. Just forgive me, I was arrogant.
Your simpleness, your innocence is your prayer. You just go. You don’t
need any certificate.”</p><p><br></p><p>But they insisted, “You have come so far. Just one time more... We
know we might forget it, but one time more so we can remember it.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the archbishop said, “I have been repeating that prayer my whole
life, and it has not been heard. And you are walking on water, and we
have heard only in the miracles of Jesus that he used to walk on water.
This is the first time I have seen the miracle. You just go back. Your
prayer is perfectly alright!”</p><p>The prayer was not the thing because there is nobody to hear it, but
their utter innocence and trust transformed them into totally new
beings, so fresh, so childlike, just like roseflowers opening in the
early morning sun in all their beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>Now that the arrogance was dropped, the archbishop could see their
faces, their innocence, their grace, their blissfulness. They returned
back on the water, running hand in hand, and reached their tree.</p><p><br></p><p>Leo Tolstoy was refused the Nobel Prize because of such stories. He
was nominated. The Nobel Prize committee opens its records every fifty
years – in this century only one time. In the middle of this century it
opened its records. So when they were opened in 1950, researchers rushed
to see in the records whose names were nominated and cancelled, and what
was the reason. Leo Tolstoy was nominated, but never given the prize.
And the reason was written underneath, that he is not an orthodox
Christian. He writes such stories, such novels... Although he is a
Christian, but he is not an orthodox Christian, so the Nobel Prize
cannot be given.</p><p><br></p><p>But it has never been told to the world that the Nobel Prize exists
only for orthodox Christians. Leo Tolstoy was one of the most
simple-hearted, innocent people, one of the most creative persons the
world has ever known. His novels have such a beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>His life was also very simple, although he was a count; his
forefathers belonged to the royal family and he still had a vast palace
and thousands of acres of land and thousands of slaves. His wife was
very angry with him – for his whole life this was a trouble – because he
lived like a slave and worked like the slaves in the fields. He was very
friendly with the slaves. He slept in their poor huts and ate their
food.</p><p><br></p><p>They could not believe it. They said, “Master, you are our
owner.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “No. We are all sharing. I work with you, I can eat with
you, I can sleep here.”</p><p><br></p><p>His wife was really angry. She was a countess; she herself belonged
to a very rich family, another count’s family, and she could not believe
he was this kind of man. “He lives with those dirty people, he eats
their food. He goes to work in the field. He does not need...”</p><p><br></p><p>And such a simple man, innocent man, creative man was refused the
Nobel Prize on the ground that he is not Orthodox church, he does not
belong to the orthodox line of fanatic Christians. Even I was amazed
when I read that statement.</p><p><br></p><p>So this Nobel Prize is just for orthodox and fanatic Christians,
politicians, not for creative artists. You are asking, “Is there any
place for prayer in religion?” None at all.</p><p>In an authentic religion, meditation has a place, but not prayer.
Prayer is extrovert, meditation is introvert. Meditation makes you a
buddha, prayer simply makes you a beggar. And prayer is fiction-
oriented, meditation is truth-oriented. Meditation is Zen, and prayer is
nothing but part and parcel of the fiction called God. Avoid prayers,
they are taking you away from your own existential reality. Go deeper
into meditation. That is the only religiousness possible.</p><p>The sutras:</p><p><br></p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN SEKITO RECEIVED THE PRECEPTS, HIS MASTER, SEIGEN, ASKED HIM,
“NOW YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE PRECEPTS, YOU WANT TO LEARN THE VINAYA, DON’T
YOU?”</p><p><br></p><p>Vinaya is one of the scriptures of Gautam Buddha. The whole name is
vinaya pitak.</p><p><br></p><p>Seigen asked Sekito, “You are initiated into sannyas, do you now want
to learn the scriptures called VINAYA?” The word vinaya means
humbleness. It is one of the series of discourses of Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>SEKITO REPLIED, “THERE IS NO NEED TO LEARN THE VINAYA.”</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need to learn the scriptures, because truth is never
found in any scripture. Truth is not a philosophy or a theology. There
is no need.</p><p><br></p><p>Sekito was sent to Seigen by his master, Eno. He was already ripe,
but because Eno felt death was coming too fast – he was very old – and
perhaps he would not be able to see the enlightenment of Sekito, he felt
it was better to send him to a master who can help him in the last
stages of his evolution. So he sent him to Seigen, who has been his
lifelong competitor. But both recognized each other in their hearts as
enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>Sekito is not a beginner, so when Seigen asked, “Would you like to
learn the scriptures?” He said, “There is no need to learn the
scriptures.”</p><p><br></p><p>SEIGEN ASKED, “THEN, YOU WANT TO READ THE BOOK OF SHEELA – the book
of character?</p><p>If you don’t want to learn scriptures about humbleness, would you
like to know about scriptures which deal with character, morality?”</p><p><br></p><p>Sheela means character. This is what the Buddhist scholar has raised
in his question against me: without sheela how can you become
enlightened?</p><p><br></p><p>SEKITO REPLIED – and this is the reply of a man who was coming very
close to enlightenment – “THERE IS NO NEED TO READ THE BOOK OF SHEELA,
because all these things will follow enlightenment. They don’t precede,
they succeed.”</p><p><br></p><p>Enlightenment contains immense treasures. You just become enlightened
and everything follows. You don’t have to learn, you don’t have to
discipline yourself, you don’t have to make any effort; everything
spontaneously follows you. Just first become a buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>So he said, “There is no need to read the book of character and
morality.” SEIGEN ASKED, “CAN YOU DELIVER A LETTER TO NANGAKU OSHO?”</p><p>Nangaku was another famous master, and this was just a strategy of
Seigen. He was trying to figure out where Sekito was. All these
questions are not for any answers; he was trying to figure out the</p><p>newly-arrived person who has lived with a great master, Eno, how far
he has reached, how deep he has reached. He is trying to figure out from
every nook and corner, so that he can know how ripe he is, and know how
much ripening he needs.</p><p><br></p><p>So this was another methodology. He failed when asking about the
Vinaya scriptures; Sekito answered exactly as if he was already
enlightened. He asked about Sheela scriptures, and he answered exactly
as if he was already enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>Then he tried a different way. He said,</p><p><br></p><p>“CAN YOU DELIVER A LETTER TO NANGAKU OSHO?”</p><p><br></p><p>Nangaku lived in another mountain monastery nearby. SEKITO SAID,
“CERTAINLY.”</p><p>SEIGEN SAID, “GO NOW, AND COME BACK QUICKLY. IF YOU COME BACK EVEN A
LITTLE LATE, YOU WILL MISS ME. IF YOU MISS ME, YOU CANNOT GET THE BIG
HATCHET UNDER MY CHAIR.”</p><p><br></p><p>SOON SEKITO REACHED NANGAKU. BEFORE HANDING OVER THE LETTER, SEKITO
MADE A BOW AND ASKED, “OSHO, WHEN ONE NEITHER FOLLOWS THE OLD SAINTS NOR
EXPRESSES ONE’S INNERMOST SOUL, WHAT WILL ONE DO?”</p><p><br></p><p>His question is very important. He is saying – with absolute respect
– he is saying,</p><p><br></p><p>“OSHO, WHEN ONE NEITHER FOLLOWS THE OLD SAINTS NOR EXPRESSES ONE’S
INNERMOST SOUL, WHAT WILL ONE DO?”</p><p><br></p><p>NANGAKU SAID, “YOUR QUESTION IS TOO ARROGANT.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody asks such a question immediately. You entered into my temple
and you started asking me questions. First, you need initiation. First,
you have to be a disciple. I am not here to waste my time on anybody who
passes by and asks any type of question. This is arrogance.”</p><p><br></p><p>It was not arrogance, but that was part of the strategy of Seigen.
Nangaku was a very different kind of master.</p><p><br></p><p>NANGAKU SAID, “YOUR QUESTION IS TOO ARROGANT. WHY DON’T YOU ASK
MODESTLY?” TO WHICH SEKITO REPLIED, “THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SINK
INTO HELL ETERNALLY AND NOT EVER HOPE FOR THE LIBERATION THAT THE OLD
SAINTS KNOW.”</p><p><br></p><p>“If you call my question arrogant, then I would rather suffer
eternally in hell than ask you any question modestly.”</p><p><br></p><p>No question is ever modest. Every question has to be, in a certain
way, arrogant. When you are questioning, you are showing doubt, you are
interfering in the silence of the master. Obviously, every</p><p>question is arrogant, no question can be modest. Only silence is
modest. But that is not a question, that is the answer.</p><p><br></p><p>But Sekito was really a man with a spine, with guts. He said, “Forget
all about the question. I will not ask the question modestly, because no
question can be asked modestly. The very question is arrogant. Any
question is a doubt. Any question is interfering in the energy field of
the master.</p><p><br></p><p>“Only silence can be modest. But then I don’t have to come to you. I
can be silent anywhere. I can be silent even in the eternal fire of
hell.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sekito is really a man of great intelligence and great courage.
Nangaku could not put him down. He was sent specially to Nangaku who was
known to be very hard. And Seigen wanted to know about Sekito’s
response, what response he would make to Nangaku.</p><p><br></p><p>And he really made the right response. He said, “Forget all about the
question. I would rather fall into hell eternally than ask you a
question with modesty. No question is modest, howsoever put. And I have
asked it very respectfully. I have called you ‘Osho, my beloved master’,
and you call my question arrogant. Rather than answering it you are
insulting me.</p><p><br></p><p>“No master insults his disciples, and I am not even a disciple. I am
just a stranger, and you are not being nice to me. I am just a guest.
You should welcome me. Rather than welcoming me, you are humiliating me.
I am not going to ask any question.”</p><p><br></p><p>SEKITO, FINDING THAT HE AND NANGAKU WERE NOT ATTUNED TO EACH OTHER,
SOON LEFT FOR SEIGEN WITHOUT GIVING NANGAKU THE LETTER.</p><p><br></p><p>That man does not deserve even the letter. And he did not stay there,
he immediately left. ON HIS ARRIVAL, SEIGEN ASKED, “DID THEY ENTRUST
SOMETHING TO YOU?” SEKITO SAID, “THEY DID NOT ENTRUST ANYTHING TO
ME.”</p><p>SEIGEN SAID “BUT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A REPLY.”</p><p><br></p><p>SEKITO SAID, “IF THEY DON’T ENTRUST ANYTHING, THERE IS NO REPLY.”
THEN HE SAID, “WHEN I WAS LEAVING HERE, YOU ADDED THAT I SHOULD COME
BACK SOON TO RECEIVE THE BIG HATCHET UNDER THE CHAIR. NOW I HAVE COME
BACK, PLEASE GIVE ME THE BIG HATCHET.”</p><p><br></p><p>SEIGEN WAS SILENT. SEKITO BOWED DOWN AND RETIRED.</p><p><br></p><p>The silence of Seigen was his acceptance of Sekito, his courage. He
knew that the letter had not been delivered, that there had not been any
reply, although Sekito had not mentioned the letter. Sekito simply said,
“They did not entrust anything to me, so how can there be any
reply?”</p><p><br></p><p>Seigen saw the man, that he has the quality and deserves to be
enlightened. His silence was his hatchet. He was saying, “When you come
I am going to cut your head with a hatchet.”</p><p>And now he reminded him, “NOW I HAVE COME BACK, PLEASE GIVE ME THE
BIG HATCHET.</p><p>Cut my head. Do whatsoever you want to do, I am ready.”</p><p><br></p><p>Seigen was silent. In that deep silence is the transfer, the
transmission of the lamp. It is not a question of language, it is a
question of a transfer of energy. Just simply in that silence the flame
jumped from Seigen to Sekito.</p><p><br></p><p>And because he received the flame, the fire, he immediately bowed
down and retired. Now there is no need to disturb the master. He has
been accepted, not only accepted; the last step for which he had come
has been delivered.</p><p><br></p><p>Eno was dead before Sekito became enlightened. In fact, the moment
Sekito left Eno, before he reached to Seigen, Eno died. He was
absolutely aware that death was coming close, and Seigen is the right
person to whom Sekito should be handed over. He was absolutely correct
in his judgment; it was Seigen who finally managed Sekito’s
enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>But enlightenment happens in silence. That’s why my whole effort here
is to make you as silent as possible. Then you don’t need even a Seigen.
Sitting anywhere – in your room, under a tree, in the garden, by the
side of the river, anywhere – if your silence deepens, existence itself
gives you the initiation into buddhahood. And when it comes directly
from existence itself, it has a far greater beauty than when it comes
through a master.</p><p><br></p><p>I teach you immediate, sudden enlightenment. The meditation that you
are practicing is just preparing you for that great silence in which
existence will become a flame inside you.</p><p><br></p><p>Etsujin wrote:</p><p><br></p><p>FALLING</p><p><br></p><p>BUT WITH EASY HEARTS – POPPIES.</p><p>The flowers are falling with easy hearts. They are not even looking
back to the tree they have been blossoming on, the tree that has been
their home for so long, the tree that has been their nourishment for so
long. Now they are going back to the earth from where they have
come.</p><p><br></p><p>Falling, but with easy hearts... There is no regret. They enjoyed the
sun, they enjoyed the moon, they enjoyed the stars. They danced in the
wind, they danced in the rain, they danced, celebrated. What more does
one need? It is time to go into eternal rest. That’s why their hearts
are easy, no tension, no anxiety. They lived totally, they are dying
dancingly. They are coming very easily towards the earth where they will
disappear again. They came from the earth, the round is complete, they
are going back to the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as flowers arise from the earth and go back to the earth for
eternal rest, you come from existence and you return to existence if you
have an easy heart. Then you will not be coming again into the
imprisonment of a body. You will simply go back to the very source you
have come from, to eternal rest.</p><p>That eternal rest is nirvana, that eternal rest is moksha, that
eternal rest is liberation, that eternal rest is samadhi, truth,
enlightenment – different names for the same experience. You have come
back home, and you have come back home dancing, with no regret, with no
complaint, with easy hearts, peacefully and silently to disappear. This
is the most exquisite experience, when you are on the verge of
disappearing with an easy and relaxed heart, a simple and pure
let-go.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha’s question:</p><p><br></p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p><br></p><p>IN HIS BOOK, The Antichrist, NIETZSCHE STATES: “PEOPLE WHO STILL
BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES STILL ALSO HAVE THEIR OWN GOD. IN HIM THEY
VENERATE THE CONDITIONS THROUGH WHICH THEY HAVE PROSPERED, THEIR VIRTUES
– THEY PROJECT THEIR JOY IN THEMSELVES, THEIR FEELING OF POWER ON TO A
BEING WHOM ONE CAN THANK FOR THEM.” WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT?</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, Nietzsche wrote his book THE ANTICHRIST in the insane
asylum. But he was such a genius, that even though he was declared
insane by all the psychiatrists, his books prove they were wrong. Even
in his insanity he was far saner than your so-called sane psychiatrists.
Even in his death – he wrote his last letter to a friend – he did not
forget... He had always made his signature, “Antichrist, Friedrich
Nietzsche”. Even at the moment of death he did not forget to write
“Antichrist” first, then his name.</p><p><br></p><p>And in that insane asylum he wrote many things which are of
tremendous importance. THE ANTICHRIST is one of the books that will help
you to understand Nietzsche’s depth. Although he never went beyond mind,
he managed even with his mind to reach to great heights and to great
depths.</p><p><br></p><p>He was anti-Christ his whole life, because he said, “Christ’s
teachings are a humiliation to humanity, because he calls humanity sheep
and calls himself the shepherd. He says humanity has committed the
original sin, and he calls himself the savior. Just believe in him and
he will save you; this is the ultimate insult to anyone who
understands.”</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why Sekito said, “I would rather suffer eternal hell than ask
you the question again. We don’t fit with each other. There is no
harmony between my heart and your heart. My journey to you has been
futile.”</p><p><br></p><p>In THE ANTICHRIST, he says many many things. His whole teaching is
concerned with the superman. God is dead and man is free to be a
superman, now he need not be a slave. Now he can declare his freedom,
and in his freedom he will become superman.</p><p><br></p><p>With God he was just a slave kneeling down before statues and
sculptures and scriptures, and praying to God like a beggar, believing
in saviors, prophets, messiahs, who were nothing but arch- egoists. The
whole humanity has been turned into a great spiritual slavery.</p><p>He was against Christ because he was telling lies: “Blessed are the
poor for they shall inherit the kingdom of God.” This is a lie. He is
simply consoling the poor. And to console the poor is to destroy the
possible revolution. And that’s what all the Christians are doing. They
are protecting capitalism, they are protecting the people who are in
power, and they are giving empty words as consolation to the poor:
“Blessed are the poor.” Nonsense!</p><p><br></p><p>And just to give them a deeper consolation, he condemns the rich. He
says, “Even if a camel can pass through the eye of a needle, no rich man
will ever pass through the gates of paradise.” This is just to make the
poor feel great: their poverty is spiritual, it is a gift of God, they
are blessed. These people like Jesus have created poverty, and have
destroyed the possibility of revolution, of changing the social
structure, of creating a better society without classes, and finally, an
ultimate society where the state also withers away.</p><p><br></p><p>People like Jesus are not the saviors, but consolers. They are
functioning, perhaps not knowingly, as agents of the vested interests.
That was the reason why Nietzsche continuously wrote before his
signature, “Antichrist”. He was very clear about it. Jesus says, “If
someone slaps you on one cheek, you give him your other cheek.”
Nietzsche does not accept it, and I agree with Nietzsche, not with
Jesus. The reason? Nietzsche gives a perfect argument for it. He said,
“If you give your other cheek to the person, you are insulting him. You
are telling him, ‘I am holier-than-thou. You are just subhuman.’”</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody before Nietzsche has seen that this statement is an insult,
that’s why I called him an original man. He just missed one thing:
meditation. Otherwise, we would have had a greater buddha than Gautam
Buddha himself, because he would have been absolutely contemporary.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you understand what he is saying? When you give your other cheek
you are rejecting the man, his humanity. You are saying, “I am a saint,
and you are just an ordinary human being.” Nietzsche says, “When
somebody hits you on the cheek, hit him, as hard as you can. That makes
you equal.” You accept the man’s dignity as a human being, and you also
say, “I am also a human being, I am not superior to you, I am not holier
than you.” A strange argument, but absolutely perfect.</p><p><br></p><p>In this book, THE ANTICHRIST, he says, “People who still believe in
themselves still have their own God.” Now they have become gods
themselves. But he does not know anything about meditation, that is the
difficulty.</p><p><br></p><p>In meditation you enter as if you are a self, but the deeper you go,
the more the self starts withering away. When you finally reach your
center you are no more. The question of being a god does not arise. You
are certainly godly, because the whole existence is godly. But it is not
a power trip, because a power trip needs others to be lower than you and
you to be higher.</p><p><br></p><p>In deep meditation you know that even trees are equal to you, that
even animals and birds and rocks are equal to you. The whole existence
lives in tremendous equality. That’s what I have been saying again and
again. Only a spiritual, meditative person can be authentically
communist and anarchist, nobody else, because as you go deeper into
yourself you disappear, you are no more. So there is no question of any
power trip, any ego number. And the whole existence suddenly becomes
just as you are.</p><p>The ego is absent, the “I” is absent; there is only a presence of
light, of consciousness, of witnessing. And the whole existence seems to
be as silent as you are, as ecstatic as you are. There is no higher, no
lower. Both the movements – the movement of communism and the movement
of anarchism – have failed in a way, because they missed the basic point
of equality.</p><p><br></p><p>Only a meditator knows everything is equal, because we are all part
of one organic cosmos. Different shapes and different forms create the
beauty because they create variety. But deep down in the roots is the
same juice; it is the same nourishment that is flowing in the tree, that
is becoming a flower, that is flowing in you and becoming a buddha. Your
unfoldment into a buddha is exactly the unfoldment of a lotus flower,
there is no difference at all. Nobody is higher, nobody is lower.</p><p><br></p><p>Nietzsche is right. If people are not meditative and they drop the
idea of God, they themselves will become gods, because who will prevent
them from becoming gods? Their egos will become absolutely inflated,
they will become more and more egoist. When God was there, they were
humble, they were afraid of punishment, of hell. Now there is no God –
who is going to prevent them from becoming great egos?</p><p><br></p><p>Once somebody objected to Napoleon Bonaparte, “What you are doing
goes against the constitution of the country. Napoleon said,”I am the
law. Throw away the constitution. Whatever I say is the constitution.”
Now this is bound to happen. The egoists become the very law. Egoist
people become gods.</p><p><br></p><p>Hirohito has died in Japan. The second world war was such a shock to
the Japanese people not because of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but because
of the defeat of the Sun God. They believed that their emperor was a sun
god, he was not a human being, he could not be defeated. Because he was
never defeated the concept continued and became more and more ingrained:
“He cannot be defeated, there is no power which can defeat him, he is no
more a human being, he is a god, a sun god.” But all great kings and
emperors have believed that they share power with God. If there is no
God, your kings, your emperors, the people who have power will start
thinking, “We are gods and everybody else is just an ordinary human
being.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he is right. If you are not acquainted with meditation, mind is a
dangerous phenomenon. Without God, it can become very inflated. It can
start thinking about itself as being the God.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of a beautiful incident. It happened in Baghdad, a
Mohammedan capital, in the times of a certain Caliph Omar. A man
declared that he has come with a new message from God, and it is a great
improvement on the Holy Koran.</p><p><br></p><p>He was immediately caught and brought to Caliph Omar, to his court.
“This man is proclaiming that he comes from God and has brought a new
message to humanity, more refined than Mohammed’s Holy Koran.”
Mohammedans cannot accept any refinement on the Holy Koran, that is the
last word of God.</p><p><br></p><p>Every religion says so. Mahavir is the last word, nothing can be
changed, nothing can be refined. So is the Buddha the last word for the
Buddhists. So is Jesus, so is Moses, every founder in the world has
tried that. “I am the final full stop. Everything stops with me; no more
evolution.” But evolution does not care about these people, it goes on
and on.</p><p>Omar was very angry. He said, “You are a Mohammedan and you are
claiming that you are a better prophet than Mohammed?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Of course, because I come after so many centuries. The
world has changed, the time has changed, it needs a new Holy Koran. I
have brought it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Omar was very angry. He told his soldiers, “Give him good treatment.
Bind him naked to a pillar in the prison and beat him for seven days.
Don’t allow him to sleep, and no food. And after seven days I will come
and see whether he has changed his mind or not.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was tortured for seven days continuously: no sleep, no food, and
continuous beating. When on the seventh day Omar went to the jail, the
man was simply full of blood, the whole body was oozing blood.</p><p><br></p><p>Omar asked, “What do you think now? Have you changed your mind or
not?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man laughed. He said, “When I was coming from paradise taking the
new message to humanity, God told me that I would be tortured. Every
prophet has been tortured. These seven days have proved completely that
I am the prophet. God was right.”</p><p><br></p><p>Omar could not believe his ears. And at that moment suddenly from
another pillar came the voice of a man who had been brought one month
before. He used to declare, “I am God himself!” So he had been tortured
in the jail – for one month. Omar had completely forgotten him – he had
become interested in this prophet – but the man suddenly shouted, “Omar!
Beware! After Mohammed I have never sent any prophet to the world! This
man is lying! I am God!”</p><p><br></p><p>What to do with these people? They are just insane.</p><p><br></p><p>No psychoanalyst can say that Jesus was sane if he is true to his
scientific analysis and scientific approach. The man is calling himself
‘the son of God’. He needs hospitalization, he does not need
crucifixion. That is absolutely wrong. He has not committed any crime,
he is simply declaring his insanity. And you don’t put insane people on
the cross, you have compassion on them, they need psychiatric treatment.
But unfortunately there was no psychiatry and no psychology. It was
waiting for another Jew, Sigmund Freud, to invent it. But he came too
late, two thousand years after the first Jew, Jesus, was crucified.</p><p><br></p><p>It is really megalomania. If God is not there, there is every
possibility that anybody who has an egoistic mind will move to the other
extreme. First he was kneeling down before God. Now knowing there is no
God, he moves to the other extreme. Now he declares, “I am God.” God has
to be there.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is the experience of one who only knows the mind and not
anything beyond it. As you move beyond the mind, you are no more. There
is no one to declare, “I am the son of God,” or, “I am God.” There is no
one to declare, “I am the savior of mankind,” or, “I am a prophet,” or,
“I am the reincarnation of God.” All these people are simply insane. And
you have been worshipping insane people because they declared themselves
to be God. All these so-called founders of religion needed psychiatric
treatment.</p><p>There are still people... When Jawaharlal Nehru was the first prime
minister of India, there were at least one dozen people all over India
who believed they were Jawaharlal Nehru. One person I knew, because he
used to live in a nearby town, and I used to go there once in a while to
lecture in that town’s college. And there I met him, because he had come
to the lecture. And the principal laughingly introduced him to me, “Here
is Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, our prime minister.” And he was dressed
exactly like Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “He looks like Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.” The man said, “Looks
like? I am!”</p><p><br></p><p>And the principal later on told me that this man goes on sending
telegrams to government circuit houses that the prime minister is coming
on such and such date, so keep the best room for him. He will be staying
for two days. And inform all the officials. And many times he has
deceived people, because in a small village nobody knows Jawaharlal
Nehru directly. They have only seen his pictures, and that man was
completely dressed like him. He had the same hairstyle, the same cap,
the same baskit, the same Mohammedan-style pajama – everything perfect.
And, because of his mind perhaps, his face was also becoming similar to
Jawaharlal Nehru. He believed it absolutely, there was no doubt about
it. He behaved the way Jawaharlal behaved, he walked the way Jawaharlal
walked. But he was never caught because he died in a car accident.</p><p><br></p><p>One man, who used to think that he was Jawaharlal Nehru, was in the
biggest madhouse in India, in Raibareli. After three years there he
finally recognized that he was not Nehru, perhaps because of the
torture, or the continuous hammering on his mind, “You are not.” He
became tired, that’s my feeling; and what happened later on proves my
feeling right.</p><p><br></p><p>Jawaharlal Nehru was going to come to Raibareli for some celebration,
and was going to come to the madhouse also, to open a new wing which had
been newly constructed for more mad people to be accommodated. So the
officers thought now that the man was cured, it would be good to give
him a release from Jawaharlal’s own hands.</p><p><br></p><p>When Jawaharlal came, they brought the madman. They introduced him,
“This is Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, our prime minister.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man looked at Jawaharlal Nehru, and he said, “Don’t be worried.
It will take three years at least. I used to think exactly the same as
you think, but these people are such torturers. Finally I had to accept
that I am not, although I know I am. In three years’ time you will also
accept you are not. Just go in. I am going out, you go in! Don’t be
worried, it takes only three years to be cured.”</p><p><br></p><p>Jawaharlal could not understand what to do with this man, who was
perfectly logical. He used to think he was Jawaharlal, then these people
had cured him by torturing him. But deep down he still knew who he
was.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened in England when Churchill was the prime minister...
Because of the second world war, in London after six o’clock there was a
very strict curfew. Nobody should be seen outside their houses,
otherwise they might be shot.</p><p><br></p><p>Churchill used to go for an evening walk. And that day there was such
a beautiful sunset... very rare in England, where the sun appears only
once in a while. So he went on sitting on a park bench</p><p>watching the beautiful sunset, and he forgot about the curfew.
Suddenly as the sun went down beneath the horizon he realized that he
was late. It was already past the time when he should have been inside
the house, which was still at least a mile away. And the strict orders,
his orders, were that everybody had to be in their house after six
o’clock. He would be shot. He looked to see where he could enter –
anybody would give him shelter knowing that he was Winston Churchill,
our prime minister, our savior.</p><p><br></p><p>So he knocked on the first house, which happened to be a madhouse. A
man opened the door, and Churchill said, “I am sorry to disturb you. I
am Winston Churchill, you must know about me, I am the prime minister of
England.” The man simply grabbed him. Churchill said, “What are you
doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “Shut up! There are already six Winston Churchills
here. Come in!” He said, “I tell you, I am REALLY Winston
Churchill.”</p><p>He said, “Don’t say anything, they all say the same thing. I am
putting you with the others. You will know who is real.”</p><p><br></p><p>There was no way to go out. There was the danger of being shot dead,
it was better to rest in this madhouse. But he was put with those six
fat guys, smoking the same kind of cigar as you always saw Churchill
smoking. And when the seventh Churchill entered, they all waved to him –
(TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF DELIGHTED LAUGHTER, THE MASTER RAISES HIS RIGHT
ARM WITH</p><p>TWO FINGERS EXTENDED IN A “V”) – the Victory sign. “Welcome, come
in.”</p><p><br></p><p>He saw this was a strange place... they all looked like him, all fat
and puffed-up, and smoking cigars and giving him the Victory sign. He
tried hard to convince them, the whole night the discussion went on. He
told them, “You people are mad. I am the real...” They all laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>One of them said, “Everybody here is real. Unreal Churchills don’t
exist.” Churchill tried, “Don’t you recognize me?”</p><p>They said, “Don’t you recognize us? We are very happy to have you.
Six were already here, you are the seventh. More will be coming! But all
are real! Nobody is unreal.”</p><p><br></p><p>He spent the whole tortured night with those six Churchills
continuously smoking and talking the way Churchill used to talk, about
war affairs and plans of how to defeat Hitler. Churchill was silent,
“What to do with these idiots?”</p><p><br></p><p>And they nagged him, “Why are you sitting silently? If you are the
real Churchill come in and discuss with us the problems of the country.
The country is in danger and you are sitting silently. And you think you
are the real Churchill?”</p><p><br></p><p>Churchill said later on, “Once in a while in the night I had a
doubt... these people are so certain, who knows? Maybe I am mad? I am
certain, they are also certain, they seem to be more absolutely certain
than me. I sometimes had some hesitation, maybe...”</p><p>In the morning he phoned to parliament, “Send people to convince this
jailer.” They were all worried, the whole night he had been searched for
all over London. “Where had he gone?” The whole of England was dependent
on Churchill’s methodology to defeat Adolf Hitler. “Where has he gone?
Is it some conspiracy? Has Adolf Hitler abducted him?”</p><p><br></p><p>So when he phoned, people immediately came and told the jailer, “You
are an idiot. You tortured our prime minister.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Just come in, and you can see there are seven prime
ministers. I am not at fault, they all say the same thing. This man was
also saying the same thing. How am I to decide who is real? You come
in.”</p><p><br></p><p>And when those people came in, they could not believe their eyes.
They said, “You are right, we are sorry. But this man is the real
Churchill. We are taking him out.” And they were high officials of the
parliament, so the jailer agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>Those six others said, “What is the matter? That phony fellow has
been taken out. We are the real Churchills – not one, six! – but nobody
takes any care...”</p><p><br></p><p>It has been the experience in many countries. Ego is insane. If there
is no God, the egoist can think of himself as God. But this can happen
only if you are not acquainted with meditation. Meditation simply
dissolves you into the cosmos. You are no more, only existence is.</p><p><br></p><p>It is time for Sardar Gurudayal Singh.</p><p><br></p><p>A new young priest, Father Fever, has just arrived at the “Holy
Saints of Sack-cloth” monastery. After a couple of weeks he is feeling
so disturbed by sexual fantasies that he goes to see the father
superior, old Father Fornicate, aged ninety-five.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, Father,” cries Fever, “I am deeply troubled by impure thoughts,
and sexual temptations come crowding into my mind – things like
doggie-style and sixty-nine, French ticklers and satin panties with
pictures of Jesus on them! The more I try to resist them, the more they
crowd into my mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm,” says Father Fornicate, adjusting his robe. “So what would you
like to know?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” replies Father Fever, perspiring, “you are ninety-five years
old and one of the most ancient relics of the church – tell me, how old
do you have to be before you are released from the lusts of the
flesh?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Hmm,” says Father Fornicate, eyeing the young priest. “It takes many
years of self-torture and holy prayer before your mind is cleaned of all
such wickedness.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Really?” asks the young priest. “How many years?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” replies old Fornicate with a sigh, “I can tell you that it is
more than ninety-five!”</p><p><br></p><p>Newton Hooton gets into Dingle Dilda’s New York taxi to go across
town, and finds himself being thrown around inside the car as Dingle
races through the streets.</p><p>“Hey! Slow down!” shouts Newton, when he finally manages to catch
hold of something, “or you will get us both into the hospital!”</p><p><br></p><p>“You don’t need to worry, mister,” replies Dingle. “I have just got
out of the hospital after being there for eighteen months, and I don’t
intend going back!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah! I am sorry,” says Newton, feeling reassured. “You were in the
hospital for eighteen months – that must have been awful! Were you badly
injured?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nope! Not a scratch,” replies Dingle. “It was a mental
hospital!”</p><p><br></p><p>Peter Pumper gets onto the famous TV game show, “Primal Passions”,
and wins his way to the final round.</p><p><br></p><p>“Okay, Mister Pumper,” says Monty Mount, the emcee, “for the big,
sixty-four thousand dollar question, which subject do you choose?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I choose ‘Sexual Techniques,’” replies Peter, excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good,” shouts Monty, “and in addition, you are allowed to choose any
expert to help you answer the questions.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I have brought with me the famous French sexologist, Andre
Perverse,” replies Peter Pumper, confidently.</p><p><br></p><p>The audience gasps with approval.</p><p><br></p><p>“Right!” shouts Monty. “Now enter the soundproof box together, and
prepare to answer the big question on sexual techniques. You have
exactly one minute to answer. The question is: You are in bed with your
mistress, and you have exactly three kisses to arouse her to the max!
Where would you place the first kiss?”</p><p><br></p><p>“On the lips!” cries Peter, without a second’s hesitation.</p><p><br></p><p>“CORRECT!” shouts Monty, “And where would you place the second
kiss?”</p><p><br></p><p>There is a pause as Peter thinks for a moment. But then he shouts,
“On the back of the neck!” “CORRECT!” shouts Monty. The audience howls
with approval.</p><p>“Now,” continues Monty, “for the third and final part of the question
– for sixty-four thousand dollars, where would you place the third
kiss?”</p><p><br></p><p>Perspiration pours down Peter’s face. He is in trouble as the music
plays louder and louder and time ticks away. In desperation, Peter turns
to his partner, Andre Perverse, and says, “Andre! You must help
me...!”</p><p><br></p><p>But the Frenchman shakes his head frantically. “Do not ask me, mon
ami,” replies Andre. “In my mind you have already been wrong twice!”</p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat) Be
silent...</p><p>Close your eyes, and feel your bodies to be completely frozen.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the right moment to turn in. Gather all your energy, your
total consciousness, and with an urgency as if this is going to be the
last moment of your life, rush towards your very center of being.</p><p><br></p><p>Faster and faster... Deeper and deeper...</p><p>As you come closer to your very center, a great silence descends over
you. It is falling like soft rain. A little more, closer, and a totally
new experience...</p><p>Flowers of peace, flowers of serenity, flowers of absolute
tranquility are growing all around you.</p><p><br></p><p>Just one step more and you are at the very center of your being,
absolutely drunk with the divine, surrounded by an aura of ecstasy. You
are facing your original face for the first time. The face of the buddha
is just a symbol, it is really everybody’s face, the ultimate face.</p><p><br></p><p>The only quality the buddha has... all the buddhas, past, present,
future are bound to have only one quality – witnessing, awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>Just witness you are not the body. Witness you are not the mind. And
witness you are only a witness.</p><p>You are just a buddha, utterly innocent, beyond mind, a pure space,
infinite and eternal. To make your witnessing deeper, Nivedano...</p><p>(Drumbeat) Relax...</p><p>Let go, the same way as the flowers fall down from the trees... with
easy heart, no tension, no anxiety. Settled at the center you are in
tune with existence, your heartbeat is the heartbeat of the whole
universe.</p><p>At this moment you are the most blessed people on the earth, because
there is no other splendor in existence greater than you are in this
moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Rejoice in this beautiful moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Rejoice in this authentic and original experience.</p><p><br></p><p>Rejoice that you are so blessed to be so close to existence itself.
And gather all these experiences before Nivedano calls you back.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to bring them from the center to the circumference of your
life. You have to live a life of grace, beauty, joy, blissfulness,
ecstasy – in every moment, around the clock.</p><p><br></p><p>Whether awake or asleep you are the buddha and all that belongs to
the buddha – the witnessing, the ecstasy, the rejoicing, the
blissfulness, the utter drunkenness that comes to you. When you reach to
your center you have reached to the very center of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>You are drowned in the juices of life, and nourished.</p><p><br></p><p>Collect all this experience and remember that you have to persuade
the buddha to come with you.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the three steps of meditation: first the buddha comes
behind you as a shadow. But the shadow is fragrant, the shadow has
tremendous solidity, the shadow is not a shadow but a presence – very
tangible, you can touch it, you can feel it. It is almost behind you;
its warmth, its compassion, its light will all be showering on you.</p><p><br></p><p>The second step: you become the shadow, and buddha comes in front of
you. Your shadow slowly slowly fades away, because your personality is
nothing but a false idea, an imagination, a fiction, a lie.</p><p><br></p><p>And as your shadow disappears your being becomes one with the buddha.
That is the third and the final step.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment you become the buddha, you have come back home. That day
will be the most fortunate day of all your lives. You have lived for
many lives, in many ways, in many bodies, and you have been missing and
missing and missing. This time, make it clear to yourself you are not
going to miss: you have to become enlightened, you have to achieve the
highest peak and the deepest depth of your being.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the very purpose of me calling your hidden secret, your
hidden splendor, to the surface. God is dead, now only Zen is the living
truth.</p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Come back... but very slowly, very peacefully, very silently, as if
there is no one in the auditorium.</p><p>Just sit silently for a few seconds to remember the path you have
followed, to remember all that great space, those beautiful moments when
your heart was in tune with the heart of the universe, those few rare
moments when your whole life was eternal.</p><p><br></p><p>And feel the buddha, his warmth, his compassion, his presence. It is
just behind you.</p><p><br></p><p>The day is not far away when you will take the second step and you
will take the third step. These ten thousand people are going to become
ten thousand buddhas in their own right. Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

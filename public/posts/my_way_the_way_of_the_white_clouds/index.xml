‌CHAPTER 1
The Way of the White Clouds
10 May 1974 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHY IS YOUR WAY CALLED THE WAY OF THE WHITE CLOUDS?
Just before Buddha died somebody asked him: When a buddha dies where does he go? Does he survive or simply disappear into nothingness? This is not a new question, it is one of the oldest, many times repeated and asked.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
You are the Way
19 May 1974 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
AS YOU KNOW, THE OLD ZEN CUSTOM WAS THAT A MONK SHOULD STAY WITH HIS MASTER FOR TEN YEARS BEFORE HE WENT OUT ON HIS OWN TEACHING.
THERE IS A ZEN STORY ABOUT A MONK WHO HAD COMPLETED HIS TEN YEARS IN THE MONASTERY. ONE RAINY DAY THE MONK VISITED HIS MASTER, NAN-IN.</description>

‌CHAPTER 11
You are the Meeting Point
20 May 1974 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHEN WE’RE SITTING IN FRONT OF YOU, HEARING YOUR WORDS AND FEELING YOUR PRESENCE, EVERYTHING FEELS POSSIBLE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN TO OUR DAILY LIVING CONDITIONS, THINGS DO NOT SEEM SO CLEAR AND WE FEEL CUT OFF FROM YOU.
YOU HAVE TOLD US THAT WE SHOULD NOT RENOUNCE THE WORLD, BUT BE MEDITATIVE WITHIN IT.</description>

‌CHAPTER 12
Whatsoever you do, be Total
21 May 1974 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
YOU HAVE TALKED TO US ABOUT TOTAL SURRENDER TO THE MASTER, BUT OFTEN OUR MINDS COME UP WITH REASONS FOR NOT FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS LITERALLY. WE SAY THINGS LIKE: THE MASTER CAN’T KNOW THAT THE SITUATION HAS CHANGED; OR, THE MASTER DOESN’T REALIZE WHAT THE PRACTICAL CONDITIONS ARE IN THE WEST.</description>

‌CHAPTER 13
God is in Search of You
22 May 1974 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
YESTERDAY YOU TOLD US VERY CLEARLY THAT WE NEED TO FOLLOW THE MASTER’S WORD TO THE LETTER. BUT WE CANNOT CONSULT YOU ON EVERY DETAIL.
HOW CAN WE CHOOSE THE RIGHT PATH WHEN THE MIND IS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE EASY WAY?
The real problem is not consulting the master, but how to be more meditative, because the physical part of the master is not the significant thing.</description>

‌CHAPTER 14
Both are Needed
23 May 1974 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
YOU SAID EVERY CHILD IS BORN A GOD, YET MY TWO CHILDREN WERE VERY DIFFERENT RIGHT FROM BIRTH. ONE IS VERY SERENE AND GOD-LIKE, BUT THE OTHER SEEMED DISTURBED BEFORE SHE WAS INFLUENCED BY ANY CONDITIONING.
HOW SHOULD WE DEAL WITH THE DIFFICULT ONE?
This raises a very basic question.</description>

‌CHAPTER 15
Share Through Your Being
24 May 1974 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
YOU SAID TO US THIS WEEK THAT WE SHOULD NOT CONCERN OURSELVES WITH OTHERS. BUT MOST OF US FROM THE WEST HAVE FRIENDS AND RELATIVES WITH WHOM WE WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WHAT WE’VE FOUND.
WHAT SHOULD WE TELL THEM ABOUT SANNYAS? WHAT SHOULD WE TELL THEM ABOUT YOU? HOW CAN WE EXPLAIN THE UNEXPLAINABLE?</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
The Mystery Beyond Mind
11 May 1974 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
BELOVED OSHO, BEAUTIFUL WHITE CLOUD, WHY ARE WE SO FORTUNATE TO HAVE YOU WITH US – AND WHY ARE WE WITH YOU?
Why’s are always unanswerable. To the mind it seems that whenever you can ask a why it can be answered. But that is one of the fallacious assumptions.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
To be Miserable or Ecstatic...?
12 May 1974 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
YOU ONCE TOLD US A STORY ABOUT AN OLD MAN WHO WAS OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD. ONE DAY, ON HIS BIRTHDAY, HE WAS ASKED WHY IT WAS THAT HE WAS ALWAYS HAPPY. HE REPLIED: EVERY MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP I HAVE THE CHOICE TO BE HAPPY OR UNHAPPY, AND I CHOOSE TO BE HAPPY.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
All Hopes are False
13 May 1974 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
YOU HAVE BEEN TELLING US HOW EASY IT IS TO DROP OUR EGOS AND BECOME ONE WITH THE WHITE CLOUD.
YOU HAVE ALSO TOLD US THAT WE HAVE HAD MILLIONS OF LIVES AND MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN WITH BUDDHAS, KRISHNAS AND CHRISTS – YET STILL WE HAVE NOT GIVEN UP OUR EGOS.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
Dropping the Ego Now
14 May 1974 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
YOU SAID THE EGO CAN BE DROPPED THIS VERY MOMENT. CAN THE EGO ALSO BE DROPPED PROGRESSIVELY?
The dropping always happens in the moment and always in THIS moment. There is no progressive, gradual process for it. There cannot be. The happening is instantaneous. You can’t get ready for it, you can’t prepare for it, because whatsoever you do – and I say whatsoever – will strengthen the ego.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
Are You Still Carrying her?
15 May 1974 am in Buddha Hall
BELOVED OSHO,
THERE IS A ZEN STORY ABOUT TWO MONKS WHO WERE RETURNING TO THEIR MONASTERY.
WHILE WALKING AHEAD, THE OLDER MONK CAME TO A RIVER. ON THE BANK THERE WAS A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL. SHE WAS AFRAID TO CROSS ALONE. THE OLD MONK QUICKLY LOOKED AWAY FROM HER AND CROSSED THE RIVER.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
The Mystery of Relationship
16 May 1974 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WOULD YOU TALK TO US ABOUT OUR LIVING PARTNERS – OUR WIVES, HUSBANDS AND LOVERS.
WHEN SHOULD WE PERSEVERE WITH A PARTNER, AND WHEN SHOULD WE ABANDON A RELATIONSHIP AS HOPELESS – OR EVEN DESTRUCTIVE?
AND ARE OUR RELATIONSHIPS INFLUENCED BY PREVIOUS LIVES?
Relationship is one of the mysteries.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
Only a Ripe Fruit Falls
17 May 1974 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
I FEEL THAT THROUGH DEVELOPING AN ATTITUDE OF ENDURANCE TOWARDS DIFFICULTIES, I HAVE BECOME RESIGNED TO MUCH OF LIFE.
THIS RESIGNATION FEELS LIKE A WEIGHT PUSHING AGAINST MY EFFORT TO BECOME MORE ALIVE IN MEDITATION.
DOES THIS MEAN THAT I HAVE SUPPRESSED MY EGO, AND THAT I MUST FIND IT AGAIN BEFORE I CAN REALLY LOSE IT?</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
Surrender and I will do the Rest
18 May 1974 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
YOU HAVE SAID: NOT IN THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS HAS SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY COME TO THIS EARTH. AND YOU HAVE ALSO SAID: THIS AGE IS LIKE ANY OTHER.
YOU HAVE SAID: SURRENDER TO A STONE AND IT WILL HAPPEN. AND YOU HAVE SAID: IT IS ESSENTIAL TO TREAD THIS DANGEROUS PATH ONLY WITH THE GUIDANCE OF A TRUE MASTER.</description>

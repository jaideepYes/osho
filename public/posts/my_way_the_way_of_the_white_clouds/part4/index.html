To hope is to be false. So it is not a question of creating false hopes: whatsoever you can hope will be false. Hope comes out of your falsity of being. If you are real there is no need for any hope. Then you never think about the future, about what is going to happen. You are so real, so authentic that the future disappears.\nWhen you are unreal then the future becomes very significant, then you live in the future. Then your reality is not here and now, your reality is somewhere in your dreams. And you make those dreams look real because through those dreams you gain your reality. As you are, you are unreal. That’s why so much hoping goes on. All hopes are false; you are real. My whole effort is how to throw you to yourself.\nAnd the ego is all false hopes combined together. Ego is not a reality, it is the collectivity of all your dreams, of all that is unreal, of all that is false. The ego cannot exist in the present. Look at this phenomenon. The ego exists either in the past or in the future, never here and now – never, never. That is impossible. Whenever you think of the past, the ego comes, the I comes. Whenever you think of the future, the I comes. But when you are here, not thinking of past and future, where is your I?\nSitting under a tree, not thinking of past and future, just being there, where are you? Where is the I? You cannot feel it. It is not there. The ego has never existed in the present. Past is no more, future is yet to be. Both are not. Past has disappeared, the future has not yet appeared. Both are not. Only the present is and in the present nothing like the ego has ever been found.\nSo when I say drop the ego, what do I mean? I am not giving you a new hope, I am taking all your hopes away. And that is the difficulty; you live through the hope, so you feel that if all hopes are taken away you will be dead.\nThen the question will arise: Why live? For what? Why move from one moment to another? For what? The goal has disappeared with the disappearance of the hope. So why go on and on if there is nowhere to reach? You cannot live without hope. That’s why it is so difficult to drop the ego. Hope has become synonymous with life.\nSo whenever a man is hoping he appears to be more vital, appears to be more alive, appears to be very strong. When he is not hoping he appears to be weak, depressed, thrown back to himself, not knowing what to do, where to go.\nAnd whenever there is no hope you feel meaninglessness come into you. Immediately you create another hope; a substitute is created. If one hope is frustrated, immediately another is substituted – because you cannot live in the gap. You cannot live hopelessly .And I tell you that that is the only way to live. Without any hope, life is real, for the first time life is authentic.\nSo the second thing to be understood is: when I say it is easy to drop the ego, I don’t mean that it will be easy for you to drop it; I mean it is easy to drop it because the very phenomenon of ego is so unreal.\nIf the ego is false, how can it be difficult to drop it? If the dream is just a dream, how can it be difficult to come out of it? If it was real, then there would have been difficulty .If a dream is just a dream, where is the problem to come out of it? You can come out! The dream cannot catch hold of you. The dream cannot prevent you. The dream cannot become a barrier. The dream has no force – that’s why we call it a dream. It is easy to come out of a dream. That’s what I mean when I say it is easy to drop the ego.\nBut I don’t mean that it will be easy for you, because the dream is still a reality for you, it is not a dream. The ego is not false to you, it is the only reality. Everything else is false.\nWe are living around the ego. We are seeking more and more egotistical journeys – somebody through wealth, somebody through status, power, prestige, somebody through politics, somebody through religion, priesthood. There are millions of ways. But the end, the result, the goal, is the same: seeking more and more the I, seeking more and more the ego.\nTo you it is a reality, to you I say it is the only reality. The false has become the real. The shadow has become the substance. That’s why it is difficult – not difficult because ego is very powerful, no; it is difficult because you still believe in it, in its power.\nIf you believe in it, it is going to be difficult, because on the one hand you want to drop it, and on the other hand you go on clinging to it. It is going to be difficult .When I say to you it is a dream, you want to believe it because you have suffered so much through it, because you feel the truth of what I am saying. If you feel the truth of what I am saying you will drop it immediately. You will not ask how. There is no how to it. You see the point and you drop it.\nYou don’t see the truth of what I am saying. When I say it is not realized that the ego is false and can be dropped, when I say that the ego can be dropped, you create a hope out of it. Because you have been suffering so much through it, you create a hope that if the ego can be dropped then all suffering will be dropped. You become happy with this hope.\nI am not creating the hope, you are creating the hope. I am simply stating a fact that this is the construction of the ego. This is how an ego is structured, this is how an ego is created and this is how it can be dropped! And because it is false, no effort is needed. Just seeing the point it disappears.\nA man is running, scared, afraid to death, and running because of his own shadow. You stop him and tell him: You are foolish! This is your own shadow – nobody is following you and nobody is going to murder you. There is nobody except you. You have become scared of your own shadow.\nBut once you start running the shadow also runs faster. The faster you run, the faster the shadow follows. Then the logical mind can say that you are in danger. And the logical mind will say: If you want to escape run faster and faster. But whatsoever you do the shadow will be following you. And if you cannot get rid of it, you will get more and more scared. You are creating the whole thing out of yourself.\nBut if I say to you: This is just a shadow, nobody is following you, and you realize the point, you look at the shadow and you feel the point, will you ask me how to drop this shadow? Will you ask about some technique, method, some yoga, how to drop it? You will simply laugh. You have dropped it! In the moment you see that this is just a shadow and nobody is following you, it has been dropped already. There is no question of how. You will have a good laugh. The whole thing was nonsense.\nAnd the same happens with the ego. If you can see the truth of what I am saying, the thing has happened. In the very seeing of it the thing has happened. There is no more how to it .If you still ask how, the thing has not happened and you have not seen the point – but you have created a hope out of it. Because you have been suffering through this ego, you have always wanted to drop it, but this want has always been half of your mind.\nAll your suffering has come through the ego, but all your pleasures have also come through the ego. A crowd applauds you, appreciates you – you feel good. That is the only bliss you have known. Your ego rises high, reaches to a peak, becomes an Everest. You enjoy it! And then the crowd condemns you and you feel hurt. The crowd becomes indifferent; you are crushed by it. You fall into a valley, a depression. You have been gaining pleasure through the ego, you have been suffering through it. Because of suffering you want to drop it, but because of pleasures you cannot drop it.\nSo when I say that the ego can be dropped easily, hope is created in you. Not that I am creating it, your greed does that. It doesn’t become a realization, it becomes a new greed, a new search for gratification. You feel that now there is a way, and there is a man who can help you to drop the ego and all the misery that ego creates. But are you ready to drop all the pleasures that the ego creates too?\nIf you are ready it is such an easy thing – just like dropping a shadow. But you cannot half drop it, and you cannot half carry it. Either the whole will go or the whole will cling to you. This is the problem and this is the difficulty.\nAll your pleasures and all your sufferings are related to only one phenomenon; you want to preserve the pleasures and you want to drop the sufferings. You are asking the impossible. Then it is difficult. Not only difficult, it is impossible. It is not going to happen to you. Whatsoever you do will be futile, no result will come of it.\nYou create hope out of it, a heaven, the intense blissfulness of a Buddha. Listening to me or listening to a Jesus or a Buddha, hope is created. But I am not creating it, you are creating it. You are projecting hope on it. And this is the problem, the complexity: every hope is food for the ego again. Even this hope of reaching a paradise, a heaven, becoming enlightened, is a hope. And every hope is food for the ego.\nWho is trying to become enlightened? The one who is trying to become enlightened is the problem. Nobody ever becomes enlightened. Enlightenment happens, but nobody ever becomes enlightened. When the room is empty, enlightenment happens. When there is nobody to reach enlightenment, enlightenment is there.\nBecause of our language, because of the duality of the language, whatsoever is said about such deep things becomes false. We say: Gautam Buddha became enlightened. This is false. Gautam Buddha never became enlightened. Gautam Buddha was the unenlightenment. When he was not there, when he became absent, enlightenment happened. When suddenly one day he realized that he was following an absurd pattern, when he realized: I am the problem, so whatsoever I do will create more problems.… It is not a question of doing right or wrong, this or that. WHATSOEVER you do will strengthen the ego.\nOnce Buddha realized this – but this realization took many years of effort – when he realized that: Whatsoever I do will help my ego more and more, he simply dropped doing. In that moment of realization he simply became a non-doer, absolutely inactive.\nRemember, this is the problem: you can even create activity out of your inactivity, or you can create activity just to help inactivity come to you. But then you miss. You can stand still, you can sit silently, but if you are making an effort to stand still, your standing is false. You are not standing, you are moving. If you are sitting silently and there is effort, if you are trying to be silent, that silence is false. You are not silent.\nWhen Buddha realized that he was the problem, and that every activity of his gave more substance to the ego, he simply dropped. Then he was not making any effort to create a non-active state. He was not doing at all. Whatsoever was happening was happening.\nThe wind was blowing, and the tree must have been dancing; then came the full moon, and the whole existence was celebrating. And the breathing coming in, going out, and the blood circulating in the veins, and the heart beating, and the pulse – and everything was happening! But he was not doing anything. In this non-doing Gautam Siddhartha disappeared.\nBy the morning there was no one to receive enlightenment, but enlightenment was there. Under that bodhi tree a vacant vehicle was sitting – breathing of course, heart beating of course, better than ever. Everything functioning perfectly, but no doer there. Blood circulating, the whole existence around – alive, dancing. Every atom in Buddha’s body dancing, alive. It had never been so alive, but now energy moving of its own accord – nobody pushing it, nobody manipulating it. Buddha became a white cloud. Enlightenment happened.\nIt can happen to you also, but don’t create any hope out of it. Rather, seeing the point, drop all hopes. Become hopeless, perfectly hopeless. It is difficult to become perfectly hopeless. Many times you reach hopelessness but it is never perfect. One hope drops, you feel hopelessness. But immediately, to cover it up, you create another hope. And hopelessness is gone.\nPeople go on moving from one master to another; that is movement from one hope to another. They go to one master with hopes that he will give through his grace, that through his energy the thing will happen. Then they try, then they wait, with a very strained mind, because a mind which hopes can never be at ease; with a very impatient mind, because a mind which is filled with hope cannot be patient.\nAnd then they start feeling uneasy because the thing is not happening. So this master is wrong, they must move to someone else. This is not movement from one master to another, this is movement from one hope to another. People move from one religion to another; there are conversions just because of hope. You can go on doing it for many, many lives. You have been doing that.\nNow, try to see the point! It is neither a question of a master nor a question of a right method. It is a question of a direct insight, an immediate penetration into the phenomenon of what is happening, of why you hope, of why you can’t be without hope. And what have you gained out of all your hoping? See it. It drops by itself. You are not even required to drop it. That’s why I say it is easy, and I know well it is very difficult. Difficult because of you, easy because of itself. The phenomenon is easy, you are difficult.\nAnd this can happen any moment. When I say this can happen any moment, I mean the phenomenon of enlightenment, of egolessness, is not caused by anything. No cause is needed. It is not an outcome of many causes, it is not a by-product. It is simple insight. It can happen to a sinner; it may not happen to a saint.\nSo no necessary condition is needed really. If he can see, it can happen even to a sinner. If he becomes hopeless, if he feels that there is nothing to be gained and achieved, if he comes to see that the whole thing is just an absurd game, it can happen .It may not happen to a saint because the saint goes on trying to achieve. He is not yet hopeless. This world has become futile, but another world has become meaningful. He realizes that he has to leave this earth, but there are heavens beyond – he has to reach there.\nAnd even people near a Jesus or Buddha go on asking things like this. Just on the last night when Jesus was going to be caught and the next day killed, his disciples asked him: Master, tell us. In the Kingdom of God, when you are sitting on the right side of God’s throne, what will our positions be there? Where will we be sitting, in what order? God sitting on his throne, Jesus on his right side, the only begotten Son, and then these twelve disciples: Where will we be sitting and what will be the order?\nPeople around Jesus asking such a foolish question! But this is how human mind is. They don’t ask anything of this world – they have become beggars – but they ask of the other world. They are not really beggars, they are hoping. They have staked this world, but it is a bargain; where will we be there? Who will be sitting next to you?\nThere must have been competition among those twelve disciples. There must have been politics, ambition, somebody up, somebody down, somebody becoming the chief. There must have been much conflict, inner politics, undercurrents of violence and aggression. Even with Jesus one starts hoping. Hope is deep-rooted in you. Whatsoever is said, you convert it into a hope. You are a hope-creating mechanism, and this hope-creating mechanism is the ego.\nSo what is to be done? In fact, there is nothing to be done. You only need clearer eyes, more perceptive eyes, more penetrating eyes. All that is needed is to have a fresh look about you, your being, at whatsoever you have been doing, hoping – a fresh look.\nAnd I say to you, in that fresh look, in that innocent look, ego drops by itself, of its own accord. It is the easiest phenomenon, and at the same time the most difficult. But remember well, I am not creating any hope in you.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nIN RELATION TO WHAT YOU’VE JUST SAID, ZEN HAS A SAYING: EFFORTLESS EFFORT.\nWOULD YOU TALK TO US ABOUT THAT, AND HOW IT APPLIES TO YOUR DYNAMIC MEDITATION?\nMeditation is an energy phenomenon. One very basic thing has to be understood about all types of energies. This is the basic law: energy moves in a dual polarity. That is the only way it moves; there is no other way for its movement. It moves in a dual polarity.\nFor any energy to become dynamic, the anti-pole is needed. It is just like electricity moving with negative and positive polarities. If there is only negative polarity, electricity will not happen; or if there is only positive polarity, electricity will not happen. Both the poles are needed. And when both the poles meet, they create electricity. Then the spark comes up.\nAnd this is so for all types of phenomena. Life goes on...between man and woman, the polarity. The woman is the negative life-energy; man is the positive pole. They are electrical, hence so much attraction. With man alone, life would disappear; with woman alone, there could be no life, only\ndeath. Between man and woman there exists a balance. Between man and woman – these two poles, these two banks – flows the river of life. Wherever you look you will find the same energy moving into polarities, balancing itself.\nThis polarity is very meaningful for meditation, because mind is logical, and life is dialectical. When I say mind is logical, it means mind moves in a line. When I say life is dialectical, it means life moves with the opposite, not in a line. It zig-zags from negative to positive, positive to negative, negative to positive. It zig-zags. It USES the opposites.\nMind moves in a line, a simple, straight line. It never moves to the opposite. It denies the opposite. It believes in one and life believes in two. So whatsoever mind creates, it always chooses the one. If mind chooses silence, if mind has become fed up with all the noise that is created in life and it decides to be silent, then the mind goes to the Himalayas. It wants to be silent. It doesn’t want anything to do with any type of noise. Even the song of the birds will disturb it; a breeze blowing through the trees will be a disturbance. The mind wants silence. It has chosen the line. Now the opposite has to be denied completely.\nBut this man living in the Himalayas, seeking silence, avoiding the other, the opposite, will become dead, he will certainly become dull. And the more he chooses to be silent, the duller he will become – because life needs the opposite, the challenge of the opposite.\nThere is a different type of silence which exists between two opposites. The first is a dead silence, the silence of the cemetery. A dead man is silent, but you would not like to be a dead man. A dead man is absolutely silent, nobody can disturb him. His concentration is perfect, you cannot do anything to distract his mind. His mind is absolutely fixed. Even if, all around, the whole world goes mad, he will remain in his concentration. But still, you would not like to be a dead man. Silence, concentration, or whatever it is called, you would not like to be dead – because if you are silent when dead the silence is meaningless.\nSilence must happen while you are absolutely alive, vital, bubbling with life and energy. Then silence is meaningful. But then silence will have a different, altogether different quality to it. It will not be dull, it will be alive. It will be a subtle balance between two polarities.\nThen such a type of man, who is seeking a live balance, a live silence, would like to move to the market and to the Himalayas both. He would like to go to the market to enjoy noise, and he would also like to go to the Himalayas to enjoy silence. And he will create a balance between these two polar opposites, and he will remain in that balance. And that balance cannot be achieved through linear efforts.\nThat is what is meant by the Zen technique of effortless effort. It uses contradictory terms – effortless effort, or gateless gate, or pathless path. Zen always uses the contradictory term immediately, just to give you the hint that the process is going to be dialectical, not linear. The opposite is not to be denied but absorbed. The opposite is not to be left aside, it has to be used. Left aside, it will always be a burden on you. Left aside, it will hang with you. Unused, you will miss much.\nThe energy can be converted and used. And then, using it, you will be more vital, more alive. The opposite has to be absorbed, then the process becomes dialectical.\nEffortlessness means not doing anything, inactivity – AKARMA. Effort means doing much, activity – KARMA. Both have to be there. Do much, but don’t be a doer – then you achieve both. Move in the world, but don’t be a part of it. Live in the world, but don’t let the world live in you. Then the contradiction has been absorbed. Then you are not rejecting anything, not denying anything. Then the whole God has been accepted.\nAnd that’s what I’m doing. Dynamic meditation is a contradiction. The dynamic means effort, much effort, absolute effort. And meditation means silence, no effort, no activity. You can call it a dialectical meditation. Be so active that the whole energy becomes a movement, no energy is left static in you. The whole energy has been called forth, nothing is left behind. All the frozen parts of energy are melting, flowing. You are not a frozen thing now; you have become dynamic. You are not like substance now; you are more like energy. You are not material; you have become electrical. Bring total energy to work, to be active, moving.\nWhen everything is moving and you have become a cyclone, then become alert. Remember, be mindful – and in this cyclone suddenly you will find a center which is absolutely silent. This is the center of the cyclone. This is you – you in your divinity, you as a god.\nAll around you is activity. Your body has become an active cyclone – everything moving fast, faster. All the frozen parts have melted, you are flowing. You have become a volcano, fire, electricity. But just in the center, amidst all this movement, there is a non-moving point, the still point.\nThis still point is not to be created. It is there! You are not to do anything about it. It has always been there. It is your very being, the very ground of your being. This is what Hindus have been calling the ATMA, the soul. It is there, but unless your body, unless your material existence, becomes totally active, you will not be aware of it. With total activity the totally inactive becomes apparent. The activity gives you a contrast. It becomes the blackboard, and on the blackboard is the white dot.\nOn a white wall you cannot see a white dot; on a blackboard the white dot appears to you. So when your body has become active, dynamic, a movement, suddenly you become aware of a point which is still, absolutely still – the unmoving centre of the whole moving world.\nThat is effortless. No effort is made for it. No effort is needed, it is simply revealed. Effort on the part of the periphery, no effort on the part of the center. Movement on the periphery, stillness at the center. Activity on the periphery, absolute inactivity at the center. And between these two.…\nThis will be a little difficult, because you may get identified with the center Hindus have called atma, the soul. If you get identified with the center which is still, you have again chosen something between the two. You have again chosen something and rejected something.\nThere is a very subtle Eastern discovery, and that is: if you get identified with the still point you will never know God; you will know the self but you will never know God. And there are many traditions, particularly Jainas, who became too identified with the self – so they say there is no God, the self is the only God.\nHindus, who have penetrated really deep, they say about this still point and this activity on the periphery, that either you are both or you are none. Either you are both or you are none! Both\nmean the same. These are the two poles. These are the two dialectical poles, the thesis and the antithesis. These are the two banks, and you are somewhere between these two – neither moving nor non-moving. This is the ultimate transcendence. This is what Hindus call the BRAHMA.\nEffort and effortlessness, movement and no movement, activity and no activity, matter and the soul – these are the banks. And between these two flows the invisible. These two are visibles. Between these two flows the invisible. That you are.\nTATTWAMASI SWETKETU, says the Upanishad. That which flows between these two banks, that which cannot be seen, that which is really a subtle balance, nothing else, between these two, that art thou. That has been called the Brahma, the supreme self.\nA balance has to be achieved. And balance can be achieved only when you use both the polarities. If you use one you become dead. Many have done that – even whole societies have become dead. This has happened to India. If you choose one, then unbalance, lopsidedness, happens.\nIt happened in India, in the East, that the silent part, the still point, was chosen and the active part denied. So the whole East became dull. The sharpness was lost. The sharpness of intelligence, the sharpness of body vigor, everything was lost. The East became more and more dull, ugly, as if life was just a burden to be carried somehow and dropped, a duty to be fulfilled, a karma to be suffered – not an enjoyment, not a vigorous dance, but a dull, lethargic movement.\nAnd it had its consequences. The East became weak, because with a still point you cannot remain strong forever, for long. Strength needs activity, strength needs movement. If you deny activity, strength disappears. The East lost its muscles completely; the body became flabby. So anybody who desired to could conquer the East. For thousands of years, slavery was the only destiny for the East. Anyone who had just an idea to make anybody a slave would turn towards the East. The East was always ready to be conquered, because the Eastern mind had chosen a point AGAINST the polar opposite. The East became silent, but dead and dull also. This type of silence is not worth anything.\nThe opposite is happening in the West. It has happened in other societies also. They have chosen the active part, the periphery, and they think that there is no soul. They think this activity is all, and to be active and to enjoy, and to achieve and to be ambitious and to conquer is all that life consists of.\nThe ultimate result is going to be more and more madness in the West – because without that still point you cannot remain sane. You will become insane. With only the still point, you cannot remain alive, you become dead; with only the active, you become insane. People who are insane, what has happened to them? They have lost all contact with their still point. That’s what their insanity is.\nThe West is turning into a big madhouse. More and more people are being psychoanalyzed, psychiatrically treated; more and more people are being put into madhouses. And those who are out, they are out, not because they are sane, but only because so many people cannot be put in houses for the insane; otherwise, the whole society would have to be put in a prison. They are normal, workably normal. But Western psychology says that now it is difficult to say that any man is normal. And they may be right. In the West it has happened: no man is normal. Activity alone creates madness – balance is impossible.\nActive civilizations become mad in the end. Inactive civilizations become dead. This happens to societies, this happens to individuals.\nTo me, balance is all. Don’t choose, don’t reject. Accept both – and create an inner balance. Dynamic meditation is an effort towards that balance. Active...enjoy it, be ecstatic, be fully with it. Then silent...enjoy it, be ecstatic about it.\nMove between these two as freely as possible and don’t create any choice. Don’t say: I am this or that. Don’t get identified. Say: I am both. Don’t be afraid of contradicting yourself. Contradict, BE BOTH, and move easily.\nAnd when I say this, I say it unconditionally – not only for activity and inactivity. Whatsoever is called bad and good, that too is included; whatsoever is called the devil and the divine, that too is included.\nAlways remember: everywhere there are banks, and if you want to be a river use both the banks – unconditionally. Don’t say: Because I was active, how can I be inactive? Don’t say: Because I was inactive, now how can I be active? Don’t say: I am this, so how can I be that?\nYou are BOTH and there is no need to choose. The only thing to remember is to be balanced between the two. Then you will transcend both. Then the devil and the divine will both be transcended. When both are transcended, that is Brahma. Brahma has no polarity against him, because he is just a balance between two polarities. There is no anti-pole to it.\nMove in life as freely as possible. And use both the opposites, both the banks, as much as possible. Don’t create any contradiction. They are not contradictory, they only appear to be contradictory. Deep down they are one.\nThey are just like your legs, right and left. You use the right, you use the left. While you raise the right, the left is waiting on the earth, helping. Don’t become addicted. Don’t be a rightist or a leftist. Both legs are yours, and in both legs your energy flows – undivided! Have you ever felt that the right leg has one energy and the left leg some other energy? You are flowing in both. Close your eyes: left disappears, right disappears. They are both you, and while moving, you can use them.\nUse both! If you become addicted to the right, as many people have become, then you will be crippled, you cannot use the left. Then you can stand, but you will be crippled, and by and by you will become dead.\nMove and constantly remember the unmoving center. Do and constantly remember the nondoer. Make effort and remain effortless. Once you know this secret alchemy of using the opposite, the contradictory, you are free. Otherwise, you create inner imprisonments.\nThere are people who come to me and say: How can I do this? I have never done this. Just the other day there was somebody who said to me: How can I do active meditation, because for many years I have been sitting silently?\nHe has chosen, and he has reached nowhere. Otherwise there was no need to come to me. But he cannot do the active meditation because he has become identified with an inactive posture. This is getting frozen.\nBecome more movement. Be moving and allow life to flow.\nOnce you know that between the opposites balance is possible, once you have a glimpse of it, then you know the art. Then everywhere in life, in every dimension of life, you can attain that balance very easily. Really, to say that you can attain is not good. Once you know the knack of it, whatsoever you do, the balance follows you like a shadow. This inner balance between the opposites is the most significant thing that can happen to a man.\nEnough for today.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5867","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/my_way_the_way_of_the_white_clouds/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/my_way_the_way_of_the_white_clouds/>My Way.

ONE WITH THE WHITE CLOUD.</p><p><br></p><p>YOU HAVE ALSO TOLD US THAT WE HAVE HAD MILLIONS OF LIVES AND MANY OF
THEM HAVE BEEN WITH BUDDHAS, KRISHNAS AND CHRISTS – YET STILL WE HAVE
NOT GIVEN UP OUR EGOS.</p><p><br></p><p>AREN’T YOU CREATING FALSE HOPES IN US?</p><p><br></p><p>All hopes are false. To hope is to be false. So it is not a question
of creating false hopes: whatsoever you can hope will be false. Hope
comes out of your falsity of being. If you are real there is no need for
any hope. Then you never think about the future, about what is going to
happen. You are so real, so authentic that the future disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are unreal then the future becomes very significant, then
you live in the future. Then your reality is not here and now, your
reality is somewhere in your dreams. And you make those dreams look real
because through those dreams you gain your reality. As you are, you are
unreal. That’s why so much hoping goes on. All hopes are false; you are
real. My whole effort is how to throw you to yourself.</p><p>And the ego is all false hopes combined together. Ego is not a
reality, it is the collectivity of all your dreams, of all that is
unreal, of all that is false. The ego cannot exist in the present. Look
at this phenomenon. The ego exists either in the past or in the future,
never here and now – never, never. That is impossible. Whenever you
think of the past, the ego comes, the I comes. Whenever you think of the
future, the I comes. But when you are here, not thinking of past and
future, where is your I?</p><p><br></p><p>Sitting under a tree, not thinking of past and future, just being
there, where are you? Where is the I? You cannot feel it. It is not
there. The ego has never existed in the present. Past is no more, future
is yet to be. Both are not. Past has disappeared, the future has not yet
appeared. Both are not. Only the present is and in the present nothing
like the ego has ever been found.</p><p><br></p><p>So when I say drop the ego, what do I mean? I am not giving you a new
hope, I am taking all your hopes away. And that is the difficulty; you
live through the hope, so you feel that if all hopes are taken away you
will be dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the question will arise: Why live? For what? Why move from one
moment to another? For what? The goal has disappeared with the
disappearance of the hope. So why go on and on if there is nowhere to
reach? You cannot live without hope. That’s why it is so difficult to
drop the ego. Hope has become synonymous with life.</p><p><br></p><p>So whenever a man is hoping he appears to be more vital, appears to
be more alive, appears to be very strong. When he is not hoping he
appears to be weak, depressed, thrown back to himself, not knowing what
to do, where to go.</p><p><br></p><p>And whenever there is no hope you feel meaninglessness come into you.
Immediately you create another hope; a substitute is created. If one
hope is frustrated, immediately another is substituted – because you
cannot live in the gap. You cannot live hopelessly .And I tell you that
that is the only way to live. Without any hope, life is real, for the
first time life is authentic.</p><p><br></p><p>So the second thing to be understood is: when I say it is easy to
drop the ego, I don’t mean that it will be easy for you to drop it; I
mean it is easy to drop it because the very phenomenon of ego is so
unreal.</p><p><br></p><p>If the ego is false, how can it be difficult to drop it? If the dream
is just a dream, how can it be difficult to come out of it? If it was
real, then there would have been difficulty .If a dream is just a dream,
where is the problem to come out of it? You can come out! The dream
cannot catch hold of you. The dream cannot prevent you. The dream cannot
become a barrier. The dream has no force – that’s why we call it a
dream. It is easy to come out of a dream. That’s what I mean when I say
it is easy to drop the ego.</p><p><br></p><p>But I don’t mean that it will be easy for you, because the dream is
still a reality for you, it is not a dream. The ego is not false to you,
it is the only reality. Everything else is false.</p><p><br></p><p>We are living around the ego. We are seeking more and more
egotistical journeys – somebody through wealth, somebody through status,
power, prestige, somebody through politics, somebody through religion,
priesthood. There are millions of ways. But the end, the result, the
goal, is the same: seeking more and more the I, seeking more and more
the ego.</p><p>To you it is a reality, to you I say it is the only reality. The
false has become the real. The shadow has become the substance. That’s
why it is difficult – not difficult because ego is very powerful, no; it
is difficult because you still believe in it, in its power.</p><p><br></p><p>If you believe in it, it is going to be difficult, because on the one
hand you want to drop it, and on the other hand you go on clinging to
it. It is going to be difficult .When I say to you it is a dream, you
want to believe it because you have suffered so much through it, because
you feel the truth of what I am saying. If you feel the truth of what I
am saying you will drop it immediately. You will not ask how. There is
no how to it. You see the point and you drop it.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t see the truth of what I am saying. When I say it is not
realized that the ego is false and can be dropped, when I say that the
ego can be dropped, you create a hope out of it. Because you have been
suffering so much through it, you create a hope that if the ego can be
dropped then all suffering will be dropped. You become happy with this
hope.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not creating the hope, you are creating the hope. I am simply
stating a fact that this is the construction of the ego. This is how an
ego is structured, this is how an ego is created and this is how it can
be dropped! And because it is false, no effort is needed. Just seeing
the point it disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>A man is running, scared, afraid to death, and running because of his
own shadow. You stop him and tell him: You are foolish! This is your own
shadow – nobody is following you and nobody is going to murder you.
There is nobody except you. You have become scared of your own
shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>But once you start running the shadow also runs faster. The faster
you run, the faster the shadow follows. Then the logical mind can say
that you are in danger. And the logical mind will say: If you want to
escape run faster and faster. But whatsoever you do the shadow will be
following you. And if you cannot get rid of it, you will get more and
more scared. You are creating the whole thing out of yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>But if I say to you: This is just a shadow, nobody is following you,
and you realize the point, you look at the shadow and you feel the
point, will you ask me how to drop this shadow? Will you ask about some
technique, method, some yoga, how to drop it? You will simply laugh. You
have dropped it! In the moment you see that this is just a shadow and
nobody is following you, it has been dropped already. There is no
question of how. You will have a good laugh. The whole thing was
nonsense.</p><p><br></p><p>And the same happens with the ego. If you can see the truth of what I
am saying, the thing has happened. In the very seeing of it the thing
has happened. There is no more how to it .If you still ask how, the
thing has not happened and you have not seen the point – but you have
created a hope out of it. Because you have been suffering through this
ego, you have always wanted to drop it, but this want has always been
half of your mind.</p><p><br></p><p>All your suffering has come through the ego, but all your pleasures
have also come through the ego. A crowd applauds you, appreciates you –
you feel good. That is the only bliss you have known. Your ego rises
high, reaches to a peak, becomes an Everest. You enjoy it! And then the
crowd condemns you and you feel hurt. The crowd becomes indifferent; you
are crushed by it. You fall into a valley, a depression. You have been
gaining pleasure through the ego, you have been suffering through it.
Because of suffering you want to drop it, but because of pleasures you
cannot drop it.</p><p>So when I say that the ego can be dropped easily, hope is created in
you. Not that I am creating it, your greed does that. It doesn’t become
a realization, it becomes a new greed, a new search for gratification.
You feel that now there is a way, and there is a man who can help you to
drop the ego and all the misery that ego creates. But are you ready to
drop all the pleasures that the ego creates too?</p><p><br></p><p>If you are ready it is such an easy thing – just like dropping a
shadow. But you cannot half drop it, and you cannot half carry it.
Either the whole will go or the whole will cling to you. This is the
problem and this is the difficulty.</p><p><br></p><p>All your pleasures and all your sufferings are related to only one
phenomenon; you want to preserve the pleasures and you want to drop the
sufferings. You are asking the impossible. Then it is difficult. Not
only difficult, it is impossible. It is not going to happen to you.
Whatsoever you do will be futile, no result will come of it.</p><p><br></p><p>You create hope out of it, a heaven, the intense blissfulness of a
Buddha. Listening to me or listening to a Jesus or a Buddha, hope is
created. But I am not creating it, you are creating it. You are
projecting hope on it. And this is the problem, the complexity: every
hope is food for the ego again. Even this hope of reaching a paradise, a
heaven, becoming enlightened, is a hope. And every hope is food for the
ego.</p><p><br></p><p>Who is trying to become enlightened? The one who is trying to become
enlightened is the problem. Nobody ever becomes enlightened.
Enlightenment happens, but nobody ever becomes enlightened. When the
room is empty, enlightenment happens. When there is nobody to reach
enlightenment, enlightenment is there.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of our language, because of the duality of the language,
whatsoever is said about such deep things becomes false. We say: Gautam
Buddha became enlightened. This is false. Gautam Buddha never became
enlightened. Gautam Buddha was the unenlightenment. When he was not
there, when he became absent, enlightenment happened. When suddenly one
day he realized that he was following an absurd pattern, when he
realized: I am the problem, so whatsoever I do will create more
problems.… It is not a question of doing right or wrong, this or that.
WHATSOEVER you do will strengthen the ego.</p><p><br></p><p>Once Buddha realized this – but this realization took many years of
effort – when he realized that: Whatsoever I do will help my ego more
and more, he simply dropped doing. In that moment of realization he
simply became a non-doer, absolutely inactive.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, this is the problem: you can even create activity out of
your inactivity, or you can create activity just to help inactivity come
to you. But then you miss. You can stand still, you can sit silently,
but if you are making an effort to stand still, your standing is false.
You are not standing, you are moving. If you are sitting silently and
there is effort, if you are trying to be silent, that silence is false.
You are not silent.</p><p><br></p><p>When Buddha realized that he was the problem, and that every activity
of his gave more substance to the ego, he simply dropped. Then he was
not making any effort to create a non-active state. He was not doing at
all. Whatsoever was happening was happening.</p><p>The wind was blowing, and the tree must have been dancing; then came
the full moon, and the whole existence was celebrating. And the
breathing coming in, going out, and the blood circulating in the veins,
and the heart beating, and the pulse – and everything was happening! But
he was not doing anything. In this non-doing Gautam Siddhartha
disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>By the morning there was no one to receive enlightenment, but
enlightenment was there. Under that bodhi tree a vacant vehicle was
sitting – breathing of course, heart beating of course, better than
ever. Everything functioning perfectly, but no doer there. Blood
circulating, the whole existence around – alive, dancing. Every atom in
Buddha’s body dancing, alive. It had never been so alive, but now energy
moving of its own accord – nobody pushing it, nobody manipulating it.
Buddha became a white cloud. Enlightenment happened.</p><p><br></p><p>It can happen to you also, but don’t create any hope out of it.
Rather, seeing the point, drop all hopes. Become hopeless, perfectly
hopeless. It is difficult to become perfectly hopeless. Many times you
reach hopelessness but it is never perfect. One hope drops, you feel
hopelessness. But immediately, to cover it up, you create another hope.
And hopelessness is gone.</p><p><br></p><p>People go on moving from one master to another; that is movement from
one hope to another. They go to one master with hopes that he will give
through his grace, that through his energy the thing will happen. Then
they try, then they wait, with a very strained mind, because a mind
which hopes can never be at ease; with a very impatient mind, because a
mind which is filled with hope cannot be patient.</p><p><br></p><p>And then they start feeling uneasy because the thing is not
happening. So this master is wrong, they must move to someone else. This
is not movement from one master to another, this is movement from one
hope to another. People move from one religion to another; there are
conversions just because of hope. You can go on doing it for many, many
lives. You have been doing that.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, try to see the point! It is neither a question of a master nor a
question of a right method. It is a question of a direct insight, an
immediate penetration into the phenomenon of what is happening, of why
you hope, of why you can’t be without hope. And what have you gained out
of all your hoping? See it. It drops by itself. You are not even
required to drop it. That’s why I say it is easy, and I know well it is
very difficult. Difficult because of you, easy because of itself. The
phenomenon is easy, you are difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>And this can happen any moment. When I say this can happen any
moment, I mean the phenomenon of enlightenment, of egolessness, is not
caused by anything. No cause is needed. It is not an outcome of many
causes, it is not a by-product. It is simple insight. It can happen to a
sinner; it may not happen to a saint.</p><p><br></p><p>So no necessary condition is needed really. If he can see, it can
happen even to a sinner. If he becomes hopeless, if he feels that there
is nothing to be gained and achieved, if he comes to see that the whole
thing is just an absurd game, it can happen .It may not happen to a
saint because the saint goes on trying to achieve. He is not yet
hopeless. This world has become futile, but another world has become
meaningful. He realizes that he has to leave this earth, but there are
heavens beyond – he has to reach there.</p><p>And even people near a Jesus or Buddha go on asking things like this.
Just on the last night when Jesus was going to be caught and the next
day killed, his disciples asked him: Master, tell us. In the Kingdom of
God, when you are sitting on the right side of God’s throne, what will
our positions be there? Where will we be sitting, in what order? God
sitting on his throne, Jesus on his right side, the only begotten Son,
and then these twelve disciples: Where will we be sitting and what will
be the order?</p><p><br></p><p>People around Jesus asking such a foolish question! But this is how
human mind is. They don’t ask anything of this world – they have become
beggars – but they ask of the other world. They are not really beggars,
they are hoping. They have staked this world, but it is a bargain; where
will we be there? Who will be sitting next to you?</p><p><br></p><p>There must have been competition among those twelve disciples. There
must have been politics, ambition, somebody up, somebody down, somebody
becoming the chief. There must have been much conflict, inner politics,
undercurrents of violence and aggression. Even with Jesus one starts
hoping. Hope is deep-rooted in you. Whatsoever is said, you convert it
into a hope. You are a hope-creating mechanism, and this hope-creating
mechanism is the ego.</p><p><br></p><p>So what is to be done? In fact, there is nothing to be done. You only
need clearer eyes, more perceptive eyes, more penetrating eyes. All that
is needed is to have a fresh look about you, your being, at whatsoever
you have been doing, hoping – a fresh look.</p><p><br></p><p>And I say to you, in that fresh look, in that innocent look, ego
drops by itself, of its own accord. It is the easiest phenomenon, and at
the same time the most difficult. But remember well, I am not creating
any hope in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IN RELATION TO WHAT YOU’VE JUST SAID, ZEN HAS A SAYING: EFFORTLESS
EFFORT.</p><p><br></p><p>WOULD YOU TALK TO US ABOUT THAT, AND HOW IT APPLIES TO YOUR DYNAMIC
MEDITATION?</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is an energy phenomenon. One very basic thing has to be
understood about all types of energies. This is the basic law: energy
moves in a dual polarity. That is the only way it moves; there is no
other way for its movement. It moves in a dual polarity.</p><p><br></p><p>For any energy to become dynamic, the anti-pole is needed. It is just
like electricity moving with negative and positive polarities. If there
is only negative polarity, electricity will not happen; or if there is
only positive polarity, electricity will not happen. Both the poles are
needed. And when both the poles meet, they create electricity. Then the
spark comes up.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is so for all types of phenomena. Life goes on...between man
and woman, the polarity. The woman is the negative life-energy; man is
the positive pole. They are electrical, hence so much attraction. With
man alone, life would disappear; with woman alone, there could be no
life, only</p><p>death. Between man and woman there exists a balance. Between man and
woman – these two poles, these two banks – flows the river of life.
Wherever you look you will find the same energy moving into polarities,
balancing itself.</p><p><br></p><p>This polarity is very meaningful for meditation, because mind is
logical, and life is dialectical. When I say mind is logical, it means
mind moves in a line. When I say life is dialectical, it means life
moves with the opposite, not in a line. It zig-zags from negative to
positive, positive to negative, negative to positive. It zig-zags. It
USES the opposites.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind moves in a line, a simple, straight line. It never moves to the
opposite. It denies the opposite. It believes in one and life believes
in two. So whatsoever mind creates, it always chooses the one. If mind
chooses silence, if mind has become fed up with all the noise that is
created in life and it decides to be silent, then the mind goes to the
Himalayas. It wants to be silent. It doesn’t want anything to do with
any type of noise. Even the song of the birds will disturb it; a breeze
blowing through the trees will be a disturbance. The mind wants silence.
It has chosen the line. Now the opposite has to be denied
completely.</p><p><br></p><p>But this man living in the Himalayas, seeking silence, avoiding the
other, the opposite, will become dead, he will certainly become dull.
And the more he chooses to be silent, the duller he will become –
because life needs the opposite, the challenge of the opposite.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a different type of silence which exists between two
opposites. The first is a dead silence, the silence of the cemetery. A
dead man is silent, but you would not like to be a dead man. A dead man
is absolutely silent, nobody can disturb him. His concentration is
perfect, you cannot do anything to distract his mind. His mind is
absolutely fixed. Even if, all around, the whole world goes mad, he will
remain in his concentration. But still, you would not like to be a dead
man. Silence, concentration, or whatever it is called, you would not
like to be dead – because if you are silent when dead the silence is
meaningless.</p><p><br></p><p>Silence must happen while you are absolutely alive, vital, bubbling
with life and energy. Then silence is meaningful. But then silence will
have a different, altogether different quality to it. It will not be
dull, it will be alive. It will be a subtle balance between two
polarities.</p><p><br></p><p>Then such a type of man, who is seeking a live balance, a live
silence, would like to move to the market and to the Himalayas both. He
would like to go to the market to enjoy noise, and he would also like to
go to the Himalayas to enjoy silence. And he will create a balance
between these two polar opposites, and he will remain in that balance.
And that balance cannot be achieved through linear efforts.</p><p><br></p><p>That is what is meant by the Zen technique of effortless effort. It
uses contradictory terms – effortless effort, or gateless gate, or
pathless path. Zen always uses the contradictory term immediately, just
to give you the hint that the process is going to be dialectical, not
linear. The opposite is not to be denied but absorbed. The opposite is
not to be left aside, it has to be used. Left aside, it will always be a
burden on you. Left aside, it will hang with you. Unused, you will miss
much.</p><p><br></p><p>The energy can be converted and used. And then, using it, you will be
more vital, more alive. The opposite has to be absorbed, then the
process becomes dialectical.</p><p>Effortlessness means not doing anything, inactivity – AKARMA. Effort
means doing much, activity – KARMA. Both have to be there. Do much, but
don’t be a doer – then you achieve both. Move in the world, but don’t be
a part of it. Live in the world, but don’t let the world live in you.
Then the contradiction has been absorbed. Then you are not rejecting
anything, not denying anything. Then the whole God has been
accepted.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s what I’m doing. Dynamic meditation is a contradiction. The
dynamic means effort, much effort, absolute effort. And meditation means
silence, no effort, no activity. You can call it a dialectical
meditation. Be so active that the whole energy becomes a movement, no
energy is left static in you. The whole energy has been called forth,
nothing is left behind. All the frozen parts of energy are melting,
flowing. You are not a frozen thing now; you have become dynamic. You
are not like substance now; you are more like energy. You are not
material; you have become electrical. Bring total energy to work, to be
active, moving.</p><p><br></p><p>When everything is moving and you have become a cyclone, then become
alert. Remember, be mindful – and in this cyclone suddenly you will find
a center which is absolutely silent. This is the center of the cyclone.
This is you – you in your divinity, you as a god.</p><p><br></p><p>All around you is activity. Your body has become an active cyclone –
everything moving fast, faster. All the frozen parts have melted, you
are flowing. You have become a volcano, fire, electricity. But just in
the center, amidst all this movement, there is a non-moving point, the
still point.</p><p><br></p><p>This still point is not to be created. It is there! You are not to do
anything about it. It has always been there. It is your very being, the
very ground of your being. This is what Hindus have been calling the
ATMA, the soul. It is there, but unless your body, unless your material
existence, becomes totally active, you will not be aware of it. With
total activity the totally inactive becomes apparent. The activity gives
you a contrast. It becomes the blackboard, and on the blackboard is the
white dot.</p><p><br></p><p>On a white wall you cannot see a white dot; on a blackboard the white
dot appears to you. So when your body has become active, dynamic, a
movement, suddenly you become aware of a point which is still,
absolutely still – the unmoving centre of the whole moving world.</p><p><br></p><p>That is effortless. No effort is made for it. No effort is needed, it
is simply revealed. Effort on the part of the periphery, no effort on
the part of the center. Movement on the periphery, stillness at the
center. Activity on the periphery, absolute inactivity at the center.
And between these two.…</p><p><br></p><p>This will be a little difficult, because you may get identified with
the center Hindus have called atma, the soul. If you get identified with
the center which is still, you have again chosen something between the
two. You have again chosen something and rejected something.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a very subtle Eastern discovery, and that is: if you get
identified with the still point you will never know God; you will know
the self but you will never know God. And there are many traditions,
particularly Jainas, who became too identified with the self – so they
say there is no God, the self is the only God.</p><p><br></p><p>Hindus, who have penetrated really deep, they say about this still
point and this activity on the periphery, that either you are both or
you are none. Either you are both or you are none! Both</p><p>mean the same. These are the two poles. These are the two dialectical
poles, the thesis and the antithesis. These are the two banks, and you
are somewhere between these two – neither moving nor non-moving. This is
the ultimate transcendence. This is what Hindus call the BRAHMA.</p><p><br></p><p>Effort and effortlessness, movement and no movement, activity and no
activity, matter and the soul – these are the banks. And between these
two flows the invisible. These two are visibles. Between these two flows
the invisible. That you are.</p><p><br></p><p>TATTWAMASI SWETKETU, says the Upanishad. That which flows between
these two banks, that which cannot be seen, that which is really a
subtle balance, nothing else, between these two, that art thou. That has
been called the Brahma, the supreme self.</p><p><br></p><p>A balance has to be achieved. And balance can be achieved only when
you use both the polarities. If you use one you become dead. Many have
done that – even whole societies have become dead. This has happened to
India. If you choose one, then unbalance, lopsidedness, happens.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened in India, in the East, that the silent part, the still
point, was chosen and the active part denied. So the whole East became
dull. The sharpness was lost. The sharpness of intelligence, the
sharpness of body vigor, everything was lost. The East became more and
more dull, ugly, as if life was just a burden to be carried somehow and
dropped, a duty to be fulfilled, a karma to be suffered – not an
enjoyment, not a vigorous dance, but a dull, lethargic movement.</p><p><br></p><p>And it had its consequences. The East became weak, because with a
still point you cannot remain strong forever, for long. Strength needs
activity, strength needs movement. If you deny activity, strength
disappears. The East lost its muscles completely; the body became
flabby. So anybody who desired to could conquer the East. For thousands
of years, slavery was the only destiny for the East. Anyone who had just
an idea to make anybody a slave would turn towards the East. The East
was always ready to be conquered, because the Eastern mind had chosen a
point AGAINST the polar opposite. The East became silent, but dead and
dull also. This type of silence is not worth anything.</p><p><br></p><p>The opposite is happening in the West. It has happened in other
societies also. They have chosen the active part, the periphery, and
they think that there is no soul. They think this activity is all, and
to be active and to enjoy, and to achieve and to be ambitious and to
conquer is all that life consists of.</p><p><br></p><p>The ultimate result is going to be more and more madness in the West
– because without that still point you cannot remain sane. You will
become insane. With only the still point, you cannot remain alive, you
become dead; with only the active, you become insane. People who are
insane, what has happened to them? They have lost all contact with their
still point. That’s what their insanity is.</p><p><br></p><p>The West is turning into a big madhouse. More and more people are
being psychoanalyzed, psychiatrically treated; more and more people are
being put into madhouses. And those who are out, they are out, not
because they are sane, but only because so many people cannot be put in
houses for the insane; otherwise, the whole society would have to be put
in a prison. They are normal, workably normal. But Western psychology
says that now it is difficult to say that any man is normal. And they
may be right. In the West it has happened: no man is normal. Activity
alone creates madness – balance is impossible.</p><p>Active civilizations become mad in the end. Inactive civilizations
become dead. This happens to societies, this happens to individuals.</p><p><br></p><p>To me, balance is all. Don’t choose, don’t reject. Accept both – and
create an inner balance. Dynamic meditation is an effort towards that
balance. Active...enjoy it, be ecstatic, be fully with it. Then
silent...enjoy it, be ecstatic about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Move between these two as freely as possible and don’t create any
choice. Don’t say: I am this or that. Don’t get identified. Say: I am
both. Don’t be afraid of contradicting yourself. Contradict, BE BOTH,
and move easily.</p><p><br></p><p>And when I say this, I say it unconditionally – not only for activity
and inactivity. Whatsoever is called bad and good, that too is included;
whatsoever is called the devil and the divine, that too is included.</p><p><br></p><p>Always remember: everywhere there are banks, and if you want to be a
river use both the banks – unconditionally. Don’t say: Because I was
active, how can I be inactive? Don’t say: Because I was inactive, now
how can I be active? Don’t say: I am this, so how can I be that?</p><p><br></p><p>You are BOTH and there is no need to choose. The only thing to
remember is to be balanced between the two. Then you will transcend
both. Then the devil and the divine will both be transcended. When both
are transcended, that is Brahma. Brahma has no polarity against him,
because he is just a balance between two polarities. There is no
anti-pole to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Move in life as freely as possible. And use both the opposites, both
the banks, as much as possible. Don’t create any contradiction. They are
not contradictory, they only appear to be contradictory. Deep down they
are one.</p><p><br></p><p>They are just like your legs, right and left. You use the right, you
use the left. While you raise the right, the left is waiting on the
earth, helping. Don’t become addicted. Don’t be a rightist or a leftist.
Both legs are yours, and in both legs your energy flows – undivided!
Have you ever felt that the right leg has one energy and the left leg
some other energy? You are flowing in both. Close your eyes: left
disappears, right disappears. They are both you, and while moving, you
can use them.</p><p><br></p><p>Use both! If you become addicted to the right, as many people have
become, then you will be crippled, you cannot use the left. Then you can
stand, but you will be crippled, and by and by you will become dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Move and constantly remember the unmoving center. Do and constantly
remember the nondoer. Make effort and remain effortless. Once you know
this secret alchemy of using the opposite, the contradictory, you are
free. Otherwise, you create inner imprisonments.</p><p><br></p><p>There are people who come to me and say: How can I do this? I have
never done this. Just the other day there was somebody who said to me:
How can I do active meditation, because for many years I have been
sitting silently?</p><p><br></p><p>He has chosen, and he has reached nowhere. Otherwise there was no
need to come to me. But he cannot do the active meditation because he
has become identified with an inactive posture. This is getting
frozen.</p><p>Become more movement. Be moving and allow life to flow.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you know that between the opposites balance is possible, once
you have a glimpse of it, then you know the art. Then everywhere in
life, in every dimension of life, you can attain that balance very
easily. Really, to say that you can attain is not good. Once you know
the knack of it, whatsoever you do, the balance follows you like a
shadow. This inner balance between the opposites is the most significant
thing that can happen to a man.</p><p><br></p><p>Enough for today.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

And because it exists between two persons, it depends on both.\nWhenever two persons meet, a new world is created. Just by their meeting, a new phenomenon comes into existence – which was not before, which never existed before. And through that new phenomenon, both persons are changed and transformed.\nUnrelated, you are one thing; related, immediately you become something else. A new thing has happened. A woman when she becomes a lover is no longer the same woman. A man when he becomes a father is no longer the same man. A child is born, but we miss one point completely; the moment the child is born, the mother is also born. This never existed before. The woman existed, but the mother never. And a mother is something absolutely new.\nRelationship is created by you, but then, in its turn, relationship creates you. Two persons meet, that means two worlds meet. It is not a simple thing but very complex, the most complex. Each person is a world unto himself or herself, a complex mystery with a long past and an eternal future.\nIn the beginning only peripheries meet. But if the relationship grows intimate, becomes closer, becomes deeper, then by and by centers start meeting. When centers meet, it is called love.\nWhen peripheries meet, it is acquaintance. You touch the person from the without, just from the boundary, then it is acquaintance. Many times you start calling your acquaintance your love. Then you are in a fallacy. Acquaintance is not love.\nLove is very rare. To meet a person at his center is to pass through a revolution yourself, because if you want to meet a person at his center, you will have to allow that person to reach to your center also. You will have to become vulnerable, absolutely vulnerable, open.\nIt is risky. To allow somebody to reach your center is risky, dangerous, because you never know what that person will do to you. And once all your secrets are known, once your hiddenness has become unhidden, once you are exposed completely, what that other person will do, you never know. The fear is there. That’s why we never open.\nJust acquaintance, and we think that love has happened. Peripheries meet, and we think we have met. You are not your periphery. Really, the periphery is the boundary where you end, just the fencing around you. It is not you! The periphery is the place where you end and the world begins.\nEven husbands and wives who may have lived together for many years may be just acquaintances. They may not have known each other. And the more you live with someone, the more you forget completely that the centers have remained unknown.\nSo the first thing to be understood is: don’t take acquaintance as love. You may be making love, you may be sexually related, but sex is also peripheral. Unless centers meet, sex is just a meeting of two bodies. And a meeting of two bodies is not your meeting. Sex also remains acquaintance – physical, bodily, but still acquaintance. You can allow somebody to enter to your center only when you are not afraid, when you are not fearful.\nSo I say to you that there are two types of living. One: fear-oriented; one: love-oriented. Fear- oriented living can never lead you into deep relationship. You remain afraid, and the other cannot be allowed, cannot be allowed to penetrate you to your very core. To an extent you allow the other and then the wall comes and everything stops.\nThe love-oriented person is the religious person. The love-oriented person means one who is not afraid of the future, one who is not afraid of the result and the consequence, who lives here and now.\nThat’s what Krishna says to Arjuna in the Gita: Don’t be bothered about the result. That is the fear-oriented mind. Don’t think about what will happen out of it. Just be here, and act totally. Don’t calculate. A fear-oriented man is always calculating, planning, arranging, safeguarding. His whole life is lost in this way.\nI have heard about an old Zen monk. He was on his deathbed. The last day had come, and he declared that that evening he would be no more. So followers, disciples, friends started coming. He had many lovers. They all started coming. From far and wide people gathered.\nOne of his old disciples, when he heard that the master was going to die, ran to the market. Somebody asked: The master is dying in his hut, why are you going to the market? The old disciple said: I know that my master loves a particular type of cake, so I am going to purchase the cake.\nIt was difficult to find the cake, because now it had gone out of fashion, but by the evening somehow he managed. He came running with the cake.\nAnd everybody was worried – it was as if the master was waiting for someone. He would open his eyes and look, and close his eyes again. And when this disciple came, he said: Okay, so you have come. Where is the cake? The disciple produced the cake – and he was very happy that the master asked about the cake.\nDying, the master took the cake in his hand, but his hand was not trembling. He was very old, but his hand was not trembling. So somebody asked: You are so old and just on the verge of dying. The last breath is soon to leave you, but your hand is not trembling.\nThe master said: I never tremble, because there is no fear. My body has become old, but I am still young, and I will remain young even when the body is gone.\nThen he took a bite, started munching the cake. And then somebody asked: What is your last message, Master? You will be leaving us soon. What do you want us to remember?\nThe master smiled and said: Ah, this cake is delicious.\nThis is a man who lives in the here and now: This cake is delicious. Even death is irrelevant. The next moment is meaningless. THIS moment this cake is delicious. If you can be in this moment, this present moment, this presentness, the plenitude, then only can you love.\nLove is a rare flowering. It happens only sometimes. Millions and millions of people live in the false attitude that they are lovers. They believe that they love, but that is their belief only.\nLove is a rare flowering. Sometimes it happens. It is rare because it can happen only when there is no fear, never before. That means love can happen only to a very deeply spiritual, religious person. Sex is possible for all. Acquaintance is possible for all. Not love.\nWhen you are not afraid, then there is nothing to hide, then you can be open, then you can withdraw all boundaries. And then you can invite the other to penetrate you to the very core.\nAnd remember, if you allow somebody to penetrate you deeply, the other will allow you to penetrate into himself or herself, because when you allow somebody to penetrate you, trust is created. When you are not afraid, the other becomes fearless.\nIn your love, fear is always there. The husband is afraid of the wife, the wife is afraid of the husband. Lovers are always afraid. Then it is not love. Then it is just an arrangement of two fearful persons\ndepending on each other, fighting, exploiting, manipulating, controlling, dominating, possessing – but it is not love.\nIf you can allow love to happen, there is no need for prayer, there is no need for meditation, there is no need for any church, any temple. You can completely forget God if you can love – because through love, everything will have happened to you: meditation, prayer, God. EVERYTHING will have happened to you. That’s what Jesus means when he says: Love is God.\nBut love is difficult. Fear has to be dropped. And this is the strange thing, that you are so afraid and you have nothing to lose.\nKabir has said somewhere: I look into people. They are so much afraid, but I can’t see why – because they have nothing to lose. Says Kabir: They are like a person who is naked, but never goes to take a bath in the river because he is afraid – where will he dry his clothes? This is the situation you are in – naked, with no clothes, but always afraid about the clothes.\nWhat have you got to lose? Nothing. This body will be taken by death. Before it is taken by death, give it to love. Whatsoever you have will be taken away. Before it is taken away, why not share it? That is the ONLY way of possessing it. If you can share and give, you are the master. It is going to be taken away. There is nothing which you can retain forever. Death will destroy everything.\nSo, if you follow me rightly, the struggle is between death and love. If you can give, there will be no death. Before anything can be taken away from you, you will have already given it, you will have made it a gift. There can be no death.\nFor a lover there is no death. For a non-lover, every moment is a death, because every moment something is being snatched away from him. The body is disappearing, he is losing every moment. And then there will be death, and everything will be annihilated.\nWhat is the fear? Why are you so afraid? Even if everything is known about you and you are an open book, why fear? How can it harm you? Just false conceptions, just conditionings given by the society, that you have to hide, that you have to protect yourself, that you have to be constantly in a fighting mood, that everybody is an enemy, that everybody is against you.\nNobody is against you! Even if you feel somebody is against you, he too is not against you – because everybody is concerned with himself, not with you. There is nothing to fear. This has to be realized before a real relationship can happen. There is nothing to fear.\nMeditate on it. And then allow the other to enter you, invite the other to enter you. Don’t create any barrier anywhere, become a passage always open, no locks, no doors on you, no closed doors on you. Then love is possible.\nWhen two centers meet, there is love. And love is an alchemical phenomenon – just like hydrogen and oxygen meet and a new thing, water, is created. You can have hydrogen, you can have oxygen, but if you are thirsty, they will be useless. You can have as much oxygen as you want, as much hydrogen as you like, but the thirst will not go.\nWhen two centers meet a new thing is created. That new thing is love. And it is just like water, the thirst of many, many lives is satisfied. Suddenly you become content. That is the visible sign of love; you become content, as if you have achieved everything. There is nothing to achieve now; You have reached the goal. There is no further goal, destiny is fulfilled. The seed has become a flower, has come to its total flowering.\nDeep contentment is the visible sign of love. Whenever a person is in love, he is in deep contentment. Love cannot be seen, but contentment, the deep satisfaction around him...his every breath, his every movement, his very being – content.\nYou may be surprised when I say to you that love makes you desireless, but desire is with discontent. You desire because you don’t have. You desire because you think if you have something it will give you contentment. Desire is out of discontent.\nWhen there is love and two centers have met and dissolved and merged, and a new alchemical quality is born, contentment is there. It is as if the whole existence has stopped – no movement. Then the present moment is the only moment. And then you can say: Ah, this cake is delicious. Even death doesn’t mean anything to a man who is in love.\nSo I say to you, love will make you desireless. Be fearless, drop fears, be open. Allow some center to meet the center within you. you will be reborn through it, a new quality of being will be created.\nThis quality of being says: This is god. God is not an argument, it is a fulfillment, a feeling of fulfillment. You may have observed that whenever you are discontent, you want to deny God. Whenever you are dissatisfied, your whole being wants to say: There is no God.\nAtheism is not out of logic, it is out of discontent. You may rationalize it – that’s another thing. You may not say you are an atheist because you are discontent. You may say: There is no God and I have got proofs. But that is not the true thing.\nIf you are satisfied, suddenly your whole being says: THERE is god. Suddenly you feel it! The whole existence becomes divine. If love is there you will be really for the first time in the feeling that existence is divine and everything is a blessing. But much has to be done before this can happen. Much has to be destroyed before this can happen. You have to destroy all that creates barriers in you.\nMake love a SADHANA, an inner discipline. Don’t allow it just to be a frivolous thing. Don’t allow it just to be an occupation of the mind. Don’t allow it just to be a bodily satisfaction. Make it an inner search, and take the other as a help, as a friend.\nIf you have heard anything about Tantra, you will know that Tantra says: If you can find a consort, a friend, a woman or a man, who is ready to move with you towards the inner center, who is ready to move with you to the highest peak of relationship, then this relationship will become meditative. Then through this relationship you will achieve the ultimate relationship. Then the other becomes just a door.\nLet me explain it: if you love a person, by and by first the periphery of the person disappears, the form of the person disappears. You come more and more in contact with the formless, the inner.\nThe form becomes, by and by, vague and disappears. And if you go deeper, then even this formless individual starts disappearing and melting. Then the beyond opens. Then that particular individual was just a door, an opening. And through your lover, you find the divine.\nBecause we cannot love, we need so many religious rituals. They are substitutes, and very poor substitutes. A Meera needs no temple to go to. The whole existence is her temple. She can dance before a tree and the tree becomes Krishna. She can sing before a bird and the bird becomes Krishna. She creates her Krishna around her everywhere. Her love is such that wherever she looks the door opens and the Krishna is revealed, the beloved is revealed.\nBut the first glimpse will always come through an individual. It is difficult to be in contact with the universal. It is so big, so vast, so beginningless, endless. From where to start? From where to move into it? The individual is the door. Fall in love.\nAnd don’t make it a struggle. Make it a deep allowance for the other, just an invitation. And allow the other to penetrate you without any conditions. And suddenly the other disappears and God is there. If your lover or beloved cannot become divine, then nothing in this world can become divine. Then all your religious talk is just nonsense.\nThis can happen with a child. This can happen with an animal, your dog. If you can be in deep relationship with a dog, it can happen – the dog becomes divine! So it is not a question of man and woman only. That is one of the deepest sources of the divine and it reaches you naturally, but it can happen from anywhere. The basic key is this: you should allow the other to penetrate you to your very deepest core, to the very ground of your being.\nBut we go on deceiving ourselves. We think we love. And if you think that you love, then there is no possibility for love to happen – because if this is love, then everything is closed. Make fresh efforts. Try to find in the other the real being that is hidden. Don’t take anybody for granted. Every individual is such a mystery that if you go on and on into him it is endless.\nBut we get bored with the other – because just the periphery, and always the periphery.\nI was reading a story: A man was very ill and he tried all types of “pathies,” but nothing would help. Then he went to a hypnotist and the hypnotist gave him a mantra, to repeat continuously: I am not ill. For at least fifteen minutes in the morning and fifteen minutes at night: I am not ill, I am healthy. And the whole day, whenever you remember, repeat it. Within a few days he started getting better. And within weeks he was absolutely okay.\nThen he told his wife: This has been a miracle! Should I go to this hypnotist for another miracle also? Because lately I am feeling no sexual appetite and the sexual relationship has almost stopped. There is no desire.\nThe wife was happy. She said: You go – because she was feeling very frustrated.\nThe man went to the hypnotist. He came back, his wife asked: What mantra, what suggestion now has he given? The man wouldn’t tell her. But within weeks his sexual appetite started returning. He started feeling desire again. So the wife was very much puzzled. She continuously persisted in\nasking, but the man would laugh and would not say anything. So one day she tried, when he was in the bathroom in the morning doing his meditation, that fifteen-minute mantra, she tried to hear what he was saying. And he was saying: She is not my wife. She is not my wife. She is not my wife.\nWe take persons for granted. Somebody is your wife – relationship is finished. Somebody is your husband – relationship is finished. Now there is no adventure, the other has become a thing, a commodity. The other is not now a mystery to be searched the other is no more new.\nRemember, everything goes dead with age. The periphery is always old, and the center is always new. The periphery cannot remain new, because every moment it is getting old, stale. The center is always fresh and young. Your soul is neither a child, nor a young man, nor an old man. Your soul is simply eternally fresh. It has no age.\nYou can experiment with it: you may be young, you may be old, just close your eyes and find out. Try to feel how your center is – old? young? You will feel that the center is neither. It is always new, it never gets old. Why? Because the center doesn’t belong to time.\nIn the process of time, everything becomes old. A man is born – the body has started becoming old already! When we say that a child is one week old, it means one week of oldness has penetrated into the child. The child has already passed seven days towards death, he has completed seven days of dying. He is moving towards death – sooner or later he will be dead.\nWhatsoever comes in time becomes old. The moment it enters time, it is already becoming old. Your body is old, your periphery is old. You cannot be eternally in love with it. But your center is always fresh, it is eternally young. Once you are in contact with it, love is an every-moment discovery. And then the honeymoon never ends. If it ends it was not a honeymoon at all – it was just an acquaintance.\nAnd the last thing to remember is: in the relationship of love you always blame the other if something goes wrong. If something is not happening as it should, the other is responsible. This will destroy the whole possibility of future growth.\nRemember: you are always responsible, and change yourself. Drop those qualities which create trouble. Make love a self-transformation.\nAs they say in salesmen’s courses: The customer is always right. I would like to say to you: In the world of relationship and love, you are always in the wrong, the other is always right.\nAnd this is how lovers always feel. If there is love, they always feel: Something is wrong with me if things are not happening as they should. And both feel the same way! Then things grow, then centers open, then boundaries merge.\nBut if you think that the other is wrong, you are closing yourself and the other. And the other also thinks that you are wrong. Thoughts are infectious. If you think the other is wrong even if you have not said it, even if you are smiling and showing that you don’t think the other is wrong – the other has got the point – through your eyes, through your gestures, through your face. Even if you are an actor, a great actor, and you can just arrange your face, your gestures as you like, then too the\nunconscious is continuously sending signals: You are wrong. And when you say that the other is wrong, the other starts feeling that you are wrong.\nRelationship is destroyed on this rock, and then people become closed. If you say somebody is wrong, somebody starts protecting, safeguarding. Then closure happens.\nRemember always: in love, you are always wrong. And then the possibility will open and the other will also feel the same. We create the feeling in the other. When lovers are close, immediately thoughts go jumping from one to the other. Even if they are not saying anything, they are silent, they communicate.\nLanguage is for non-lovers, those who are not in love. For lovers, silence is enough language. Without saying anything, they go on speaking.\nIf you take love as sadhana, then don’t say the other is wrong. Just try to find out: somewhere, something must be wrong in you, and drop that wrongness.\nIt is going to be difficult because it is going to be against the ego. It is going to be difficult because it will hurt your pride. It is going to be difficult because this will not be dominating, possessing. You will not be more powerful through possessing the other. This will destroy your ego – that’s why it is going to be difficult.\nBut destruction of the ego is the point, the goal. From wherever you like to approach the inner world – from love, from meditation, from yoga, from prayer – whatsoever the path you choose, the goal is the same: the destruction of the ego, throwing the ego away.\nThrough love it can be done very easily. And it is so natural! Love is the natural religion. Anything else is going to be more and more unnatural. If you cannot work through love, it will be difficult for you to work through anything else.\nDon’t think much about past lives, and don’t think much about the future. The present is enough. Don’t think that relationship is coming from the past – it is coming from the past, but don’t think about it because then you will get more complicated. Make things easier.\nIt is going on – from your past lives things have a continuity, so I don’t deny the fact, but don’t get burdened by it. It will continue in the future, but don’t think about it. The present is more than enough. Munch the cake and say: THIS cake is delicious. Don’t think of the past and don’t think of the future; they will take care of themselves.\nNothing is discontinuous. You have been in relationships in the past. You have loved, you have hated, you have made friends and you have made enemies. That continues, known, unknown to you, it is always there. But if you start brooding about it, you will miss the present moment.\nSo think as if there is no past, and think as if there is no future. THIS moment is all that is given to you. Work it out, as if this moment is all. Behave as if this moment is all and work out how you can transform your energies into a loving phenomenon – this very moment.\nPeople come to me and they want to know about their past lives. They HAD past lives, but it is irrelevant. Why this inquiry? What are you going to do about the past? Nothing can be done now. The past is past and it cannot be undone. You cannot change it. You cannot go back. That’s why nature, in its wisdom, doesn’t allow you to remember past lives. Otherwise you would go mad.\nYou may be in love with a girl. If you suddenly become aware that that girl was your mother in your past life, things will become very complicated. Then what to do? And when that girl has been your mother in a past life, making love to her now will create guilt. Not making love to her will also create guilt, because you love her.\nThat’s why I say nature in its wisdom never allows you to remember your past lives – unless you come to a point where it can be allowed, when you become so meditative that nothing disturbs you, then the gates open and all your past lives are before you. It is an automatic mechanism, though sometimes the mechanism doesn’t work. Through accidents some children are born who can remember. But their lives are destroyed.\nOne girl was brought to me a few years ago. She remembered her past two lives. She was only thirteen at that time, but if you looked in her eyes they looked near about seventy – because she remembered seventy years, two past lives.\nHer body was thirteen years old, but her mind was seventy years old. She couldn’t play with other children, because how can an old woman of seventy play with children? She would talk and behave like an old woman. And she was burdened, the worries of all those years in her mind.\nShe remembered so accurately that her two past families could be found. One was in Assam, the other in Madhya Pradesh. And when she came in contact with her old families, she became so much attached to them that it became a problem; where should she live now?\nI told the parents: Leave the girl with me for at least three weeks. I will make an effort to help her forget, because this girl’s life will be a perversion. She cannot fall in love with somebody – she is so old! Your oldness is concerned with your memory. If the memory span is of seventy years, then you feel like seventy. And she seemed so tortured – her face, the features, all tortured. She seemed so ill at her center – uneasy, uncomfortable. Everything seemed to be wrong.\nBut the parents were enjoying the whole thing, because people started coming and the newspapers started giving the report. They were enjoying the whole thing. They wouldn’t listen to me and I told them: This girl will go mad.\nThey never brought the girl to me again. But after seven years, they came – the girl had gone mad. They said: Now do something. I said: It is now impossible to do anything. Now only death will be a help to her.\nYou don’t remember because it would be difficult for you to manage. Even in this life you are making such a mess – many lives remembered, you would simply go mad. Don’t think about it. It is irrelevant also.\nThe relevant point is: be here and now, and work out your way. If you can work it out through relationship, beautiful. If you cannot work it out through relationship, then work it out in your\nloneliness. These are the two paths. Love means working out your path through relationship. And meditation: working it out in your loneliness. Love and meditation – these are the two paths.\nFeel which will suit you. Then bring your total energies to it, and move on that path. Question 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nYOUR WORDS ARE SO BEAUTIFUL, YET WE FEEL THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER COMMUNICATION HAPPENING WHEN YOU ARE TALKING TO US.\nWOULD YOU TALK TO US ABOUT SILENT COMMUNICATION, AND HOW WE CAN BECOME MORE OPEN TO IT.\nIt is always there. While I am talking to you, I am also BEING to you. Talking is relating to you through the intellect, and being is relating to you with my totality.\nWhile you are listening to me, if you are really listening, then it is not only a listening to the words. Listening to me, your mind stops. Listening to me, you are not thinking. When you are not thinking, you are open. And when you are not thinking and your mind is not functioning, you start feeling. Then I can overwhelm you, I can move and fill you. Words are used only as a device.\nI myself am not interested much in words. But I have to speak, because this has been my feeling: while I am speaking you become silent. If I am not speaking, then you are speaking within and you are not silent.\nIf you are silent without my speaking then there will be no need to speak. I am waiting for that moment when you can just sit by my side, just sit near me, not thinking. Then there is no need to talk – because talk is partial. Then I can come in my totality to you, directly, no need for any mediating words.\nBut if I tell you to sit silently near me, you will not be able to sit silently. You will go on chattering, you will go on talking within. An inner talk will continue. To stop your inner talk I have to talk to you, so while I am talking you are engaged.\nMy talking is just like a toy given to a child. He goes and plays with the toy, and becomes silent, absorbed. I give you my words as toys. You play with them, and while you are playing with them you are so absorbed that you become silent. Whenever silence happens, I can flow into you.\nWords can be beautiful, but they can never be true. Beauty is an aesthetic value. You can enjoy it, just like a beautiful painting, but nothing much will happen out of that enjoyment. It is good as far as it goes, but words are never true. They cannot be by their very nature. Truth can be communicated only in silence.\nBut this is the paradox: all those who have insisted that truth can be communicated only in silence have all used words. This is a shame, but nothing can be done about it. Words have to be used\nto make you silent. While listening to me you become silent. That silence is significant, and that silence will give you glimpses of truth.\nEven if you have glimpses of truth through my words, that glimpse comes through your silence, not through my words. Even if you feel absolutely certain that whatsoever I am saying is true, that feeling of absolute certainty comes through your silence, not through my words.\nWhenever you are silent, truth is there. Whenever you are chattering inside, the monkey-chatter goes on inside, you miss the truth which is always present.\nWhatsoever I do – talk to you, help you to meditate with me, force you into a catharsis, or persuade you to dance, to celebrate – whatsoever I do, there is only one aim: somehow to help you to become silent, because whenever you are silent, doors are open; you are in the temple.\nHow you become silent is not relevant. You become silent and then I am within you, you are within me. Silence knows no boundaries. In silence, love is happening. I have become a lover to you; you have become a lover to me. In silence, all that is significant happens. But to bring silence is a problem, arduous.\nSo I am not much interested in what I say to you. I am interested in what happens to you while I am saying anything – x, y, z. Sometimes I go on contradicting myself. Today I say something, tomorrow I will say something else because what I say is not the point. My talking is just like poetry. I am not a philosopher. I may be a poet, but I am not a philosopher.\nTomorrow I will say something else; the day after tomorrow something else. That is not the point. My sayings may contradict, but I am not contradictory – because today I say something and you become silent; tomorrow I say something absolutely contradictory and you become silent; the day after tomorrow I again say something absolutely contradictory, all that I have said contradicts it, but you become silent. Your silence is my consistency.\nI am consistent, constantly consistent; contradicting on the surface, but the inner current remains the same.\nAnd remember, if I say the same thing every day to you, you will not be silent. Then you will get bored and your inner talk will start. If I go on saying the same thing, it will become old. When it is old you need not listen to it, or even without listening you know what I am saying, so you can continue your inner talk.\nI have to be inventive, saying things, shocking you sometimes, but one inner consistency remains, that is to create silence in you – because then I can be with you and you can be with me. The love, the truth can flower there. Whenever there is silence, truth flowers. Truth is a flowering of silence.\nEnough for today.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5860","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/my_way_the_way_of_the_white_clouds/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/my_way_the_way_of_the_white_clouds/>My Way.

AND LOVERS.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN SHOULD WE PERSEVERE WITH A PARTNER, AND WHEN SHOULD WE ABANDON A
RELATIONSHIP AS HOPELESS – OR EVEN DESTRUCTIVE?</p><p><br></p><p>AND ARE OUR RELATIONSHIPS INFLUENCED BY PREVIOUS LIVES?</p><p><br></p><p>Relationship is one of the mysteries. And because it exists between
two persons, it depends on both.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever two persons meet, a new world is created. Just by their
meeting, a new phenomenon comes into existence – which was not before,
which never existed before. And through that new phenomenon, both
persons are changed and transformed.</p><p><br></p><p>Unrelated, you are one thing; related, immediately you become
something else. A new thing has happened. A woman when she becomes a
lover is no longer the same woman. A man when he becomes a father is no
longer the same man. A child is born, but we miss one point completely;
the moment the child is born, the mother is also born. This never
existed before. The woman existed, but the mother never. And a mother is
something absolutely new.</p><p>Relationship is created by you, but then, in its turn, relationship
creates you. Two persons meet, that means two worlds meet. It is not a
simple thing but very complex, the most complex. Each person is a world
unto himself or herself, a complex mystery with a long past and an
eternal future.</p><p><br></p><p>In the beginning only peripheries meet. But if the relationship grows
intimate, becomes closer, becomes deeper, then by and by centers start
meeting. When centers meet, it is called love.</p><p><br></p><p>When peripheries meet, it is acquaintance. You touch the person from
the without, just from the boundary, then it is acquaintance. Many times
you start calling your acquaintance your love. Then you are in a
fallacy. Acquaintance is not love.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is very rare. To meet a person at his center is to pass through
a revolution yourself, because if you want to meet a person at his
center, you will have to allow that person to reach to your center also.
You will have to become vulnerable, absolutely vulnerable, open.</p><p><br></p><p>It is risky. To allow somebody to reach your center is risky,
dangerous, because you never know what that person will do to you. And
once all your secrets are known, once your hiddenness has become
unhidden, once you are exposed completely, what that other person will
do, you never know. The fear is there. That’s why we never open.</p><p><br></p><p>Just acquaintance, and we think that love has happened. Peripheries
meet, and we think we have met. You are not your periphery. Really, the
periphery is the boundary where you end, just the fencing around you. It
is not you! The periphery is the place where you end and the world
begins.</p><p><br></p><p>Even husbands and wives who may have lived together for many years
may be just acquaintances. They may not have known each other. And the
more you live with someone, the more you forget completely that the
centers have remained unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing to be understood is: don’t take acquaintance as
love. You may be making love, you may be sexually related, but sex is
also peripheral. Unless centers meet, sex is just a meeting of two
bodies. And a meeting of two bodies is not your meeting. Sex also
remains acquaintance – physical, bodily, but still acquaintance. You can
allow somebody to enter to your center only when you are not afraid,
when you are not fearful.</p><p><br></p><p>So I say to you that there are two types of living. One:
fear-oriented; one: love-oriented. Fear- oriented living can never lead
you into deep relationship. You remain afraid, and the other cannot be
allowed, cannot be allowed to penetrate you to your very core. To an
extent you allow the other and then the wall comes and everything
stops.</p><p><br></p><p>The love-oriented person is the religious person. The love-oriented
person means one who is not afraid of the future, one who is not afraid
of the result and the consequence, who lives here and now.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what Krishna says to Arjuna in the Gita: Don’t be bothered
about the result. That is the fear-oriented mind. Don’t think about what
will happen out of it. Just be here, and act totally. Don’t calculate. A
fear-oriented man is always calculating, planning, arranging,
safeguarding. His whole life is lost in this way.</p><p>I have heard about an old Zen monk. He was on his deathbed. The last
day had come, and he declared that that evening he would be no more. So
followers, disciples, friends started coming. He had many lovers. They
all started coming. From far and wide people gathered.</p><p><br></p><p>One of his old disciples, when he heard that the master was going to
die, ran to the market. Somebody asked: The master is dying in his hut,
why are you going to the market? The old disciple said: I know that my
master loves a particular type of cake, so I am going to purchase the
cake.</p><p><br></p><p>It was difficult to find the cake, because now it had gone out of
fashion, but by the evening somehow he managed. He came running with the
cake.</p><p><br></p><p>And everybody was worried – it was as if the master was waiting for
someone. He would open his eyes and look, and close his eyes again. And
when this disciple came, he said: Okay, so you have come. Where is the
cake? The disciple produced the cake – and he was very happy that the
master asked about the cake.</p><p><br></p><p>Dying, the master took the cake in his hand, but his hand was not
trembling. He was very old, but his hand was not trembling. So somebody
asked: You are so old and just on the verge of dying. The last breath is
soon to leave you, but your hand is not trembling.</p><p><br></p><p>The master said: I never tremble, because there is no fear. My body
has become old, but I am still young, and I will remain young even when
the body is gone.</p><p><br></p><p>Then he took a bite, started munching the cake. And then somebody
asked: What is your last message, Master? You will be leaving us soon.
What do you want us to remember?</p><p><br></p><p>The master smiled and said: Ah, this cake is delicious.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a man who lives in the here and now: This cake is delicious.
Even death is irrelevant. The next moment is meaningless. THIS moment
this cake is delicious. If you can be in this moment, this present
moment, this presentness, the plenitude, then only can you love.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is a rare flowering. It happens only sometimes. Millions and
millions of people live in the false attitude that they are lovers. They
believe that they love, but that is their belief only.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is a rare flowering. Sometimes it happens. It is rare because it
can happen only when there is no fear, never before. That means love can
happen only to a very deeply spiritual, religious person. Sex is
possible for all. Acquaintance is possible for all. Not love.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are not afraid, then there is nothing to hide, then you can
be open, then you can withdraw all boundaries. And then you can invite
the other to penetrate you to the very core.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, if you allow somebody to penetrate you deeply, the
other will allow you to penetrate into himself or herself, because when
you allow somebody to penetrate you, trust is created. When you are not
afraid, the other becomes fearless.</p><p><br></p><p>In your love, fear is always there. The husband is afraid of the
wife, the wife is afraid of the husband. Lovers are always afraid. Then
it is not love. Then it is just an arrangement of two fearful
persons</p><p>depending on each other, fighting, exploiting, manipulating,
controlling, dominating, possessing – but it is not love.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can allow love to happen, there is no need for prayer, there
is no need for meditation, there is no need for any church, any temple.
You can completely forget God if you can love – because through love,
everything will have happened to you: meditation, prayer, God.
EVERYTHING will have happened to you. That’s what Jesus means when he
says: Love is God.</p><p><br></p><p>But love is difficult. Fear has to be dropped. And this is the
strange thing, that you are so afraid and you have nothing to lose.</p><p><br></p><p>Kabir has said somewhere: I look into people. They are so much
afraid, but I can’t see why – because they have nothing to lose. Says
Kabir: They are like a person who is naked, but never goes to take a
bath in the river because he is afraid – where will he dry his clothes?
This is the situation you are in – naked, with no clothes, but always
afraid about the clothes.</p><p><br></p><p>What have you got to lose? Nothing. This body will be taken by death.
Before it is taken by death, give it to love. Whatsoever you have will
be taken away. Before it is taken away, why not share it? That is the
ONLY way of possessing it. If you can share and give, you are the
master. It is going to be taken away. There is nothing which you can
retain forever. Death will destroy everything.</p><p><br></p><p>So, if you follow me rightly, the struggle is between death and love.
If you can give, there will be no death. Before anything can be taken
away from you, you will have already given it, you will have made it a
gift. There can be no death.</p><p><br></p><p>For a lover there is no death. For a non-lover, every moment is a
death, because every moment something is being snatched away from him.
The body is disappearing, he is losing every moment. And then there will
be death, and everything will be annihilated.</p><p><br></p><p>What is the fear? Why are you so afraid? Even if everything is known
about you and you are an open book, why fear? How can it harm you? Just
false conceptions, just conditionings given by the society, that you
have to hide, that you have to protect yourself, that you have to be
constantly in a fighting mood, that everybody is an enemy, that
everybody is against you.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody is against you! Even if you feel somebody is against you, he
too is not against you – because everybody is concerned with himself,
not with you. There is nothing to fear. This has to be realized before a
real relationship can happen. There is nothing to fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditate on it. And then allow the other to enter you, invite the
other to enter you. Don’t create any barrier anywhere, become a passage
always open, no locks, no doors on you, no closed doors on you. Then
love is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>When two centers meet, there is love. And love is an alchemical
phenomenon – just like hydrogen and oxygen meet and a new thing, water,
is created. You can have hydrogen, you can have oxygen, but if you are
thirsty, they will be useless. You can have as much oxygen as you want,
as much hydrogen as you like, but the thirst will not go.</p><p>When two centers meet a new thing is created. That new thing is love.
And it is just like water, the thirst of many, many lives is satisfied.
Suddenly you become content. That is the visible sign of love; you
become content, as if you have achieved everything. There is nothing to
achieve now; You have reached the goal. There is no further goal,
destiny is fulfilled. The seed has become a flower, has come to its
total flowering.</p><p><br></p><p>Deep contentment is the visible sign of love. Whenever a person is in
love, he is in deep contentment. Love cannot be seen, but contentment,
the deep satisfaction around him...his every breath, his every movement,
his very being – content.</p><p><br></p><p>You may be surprised when I say to you that love makes you
desireless, but desire is with discontent. You desire because you don’t
have. You desire because you think if you have something it will give
you contentment. Desire is out of discontent.</p><p><br></p><p>When there is love and two centers have met and dissolved and merged,
and a new alchemical quality is born, contentment is there. It is as if
the whole existence has stopped – no movement. Then the present moment
is the only moment. And then you can say: Ah, this cake is delicious.
Even death doesn’t mean anything to a man who is in love.</p><p><br></p><p>So I say to you, love will make you desireless. Be fearless, drop
fears, be open. Allow some center to meet the center within you. you
will be reborn through it, a new quality of being will be created.</p><p><br></p><p>This quality of being says: This is god. God is not an argument, it
is a fulfillment, a feeling of fulfillment. You may have observed that
whenever you are discontent, you want to deny God. Whenever you are
dissatisfied, your whole being wants to say: There is no God.</p><p><br></p><p>Atheism is not out of logic, it is out of discontent. You may
rationalize it – that’s another thing. You may not say you are an
atheist because you are discontent. You may say: There is no God and I
have got proofs. But that is not the true thing.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are satisfied, suddenly your whole being says: THERE is god.
Suddenly you feel it! The whole existence becomes divine. If love is
there you will be really for the first time in the feeling that
existence is divine and everything is a blessing. But much has to be
done before this can happen. Much has to be destroyed before this can
happen. You have to destroy all that creates barriers in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Make love a SADHANA, an inner discipline. Don’t allow it just to be a
frivolous thing. Don’t allow it just to be an occupation of the mind.
Don’t allow it just to be a bodily satisfaction. Make it an inner
search, and take the other as a help, as a friend.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have heard anything about Tantra, you will know that Tantra
says: If you can find a consort, a friend, a woman or a man, who is
ready to move with you towards the inner center, who is ready to move
with you to the highest peak of relationship, then this relationship
will become meditative. Then through this relationship you will achieve
the ultimate relationship. Then the other becomes just a door.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me explain it: if you love a person, by and by first the
periphery of the person disappears, the form of the person disappears.
You come more and more in contact with the formless, the inner.</p><p>The form becomes, by and by, vague and disappears. And if you go
deeper, then even this formless individual starts disappearing and
melting. Then the beyond opens. Then that particular individual was just
a door, an opening. And through your lover, you find the divine.</p><p><br></p><p>Because we cannot love, we need so many religious rituals. They are
substitutes, and very poor substitutes. A Meera needs no temple to go
to. The whole existence is her temple. She can dance before a tree and
the tree becomes Krishna. She can sing before a bird and the bird
becomes Krishna. She creates her Krishna around her everywhere. Her love
is such that wherever she looks the door opens and the Krishna is
revealed, the beloved is revealed.</p><p><br></p><p>But the first glimpse will always come through an individual. It is
difficult to be in contact with the universal. It is so big, so vast, so
beginningless, endless. From where to start? From where to move into it?
The individual is the door. Fall in love.</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t make it a struggle. Make it a deep allowance for the other,
just an invitation. And allow the other to penetrate you without any
conditions. And suddenly the other disappears and God is there. If your
lover or beloved cannot become divine, then nothing in this world can
become divine. Then all your religious talk is just nonsense.</p><p><br></p><p>This can happen with a child. This can happen with an animal, your
dog. If you can be in deep relationship with a dog, it can happen – the
dog becomes divine! So it is not a question of man and woman only. That
is one of the deepest sources of the divine and it reaches you
naturally, but it can happen from anywhere. The basic key is this: you
should allow the other to penetrate you to your very deepest core, to
the very ground of your being.</p><p><br></p><p>But we go on deceiving ourselves. We think we love. And if you think
that you love, then there is no possibility for love to happen – because
if this is love, then everything is closed. Make fresh efforts. Try to
find in the other the real being that is hidden. Don’t take anybody for
granted. Every individual is such a mystery that if you go on and on
into him it is endless.</p><p><br></p><p>But we get bored with the other – because just the periphery, and
always the periphery.</p><p><br></p><p>I was reading a story: A man was very ill and he tried all types of
“pathies,” but nothing would help. Then he went to a hypnotist and the
hypnotist gave him a mantra, to repeat continuously: I am not ill. For
at least fifteen minutes in the morning and fifteen minutes at night: I
am not ill, I am healthy. And the whole day, whenever you remember,
repeat it. Within a few days he started getting better. And within weeks
he was absolutely okay.</p><p><br></p><p>Then he told his wife: This has been a miracle! Should I go to this
hypnotist for another miracle also? Because lately I am feeling no
sexual appetite and the sexual relationship has almost stopped. There is
no desire.</p><p><br></p><p>The wife was happy. She said: You go – because she was feeling very
frustrated.</p><p><br></p><p>The man went to the hypnotist. He came back, his wife asked: What
mantra, what suggestion now has he given? The man wouldn’t tell her. But
within weeks his sexual appetite started returning. He started feeling
desire again. So the wife was very much puzzled. She continuously
persisted in</p><p>asking, but the man would laugh and would not say anything. So one
day she tried, when he was in the bathroom in the morning doing his
meditation, that fifteen-minute mantra, she tried to hear what he was
saying. And he was saying: She is not my wife. She is not my wife. She
is not my wife.</p><p><br></p><p>We take persons for granted. Somebody is your wife – relationship is
finished. Somebody is your husband – relationship is finished. Now there
is no adventure, the other has become a thing, a commodity. The other is
not now a mystery to be searched the other is no more new.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, everything goes dead with age. The periphery is always old,
and the center is always new. The periphery cannot remain new, because
every moment it is getting old, stale. The center is always fresh and
young. Your soul is neither a child, nor a young man, nor an old man.
Your soul is simply eternally fresh. It has no age.</p><p><br></p><p>You can experiment with it: you may be young, you may be old, just
close your eyes and find out. Try to feel how your center is – old?
young? You will feel that the center is neither. It is always new, it
never gets old. Why? Because the center doesn’t belong to time.</p><p><br></p><p>In the process of time, everything becomes old. A man is born – the
body has started becoming old already! When we say that a child is one
week old, it means one week of oldness has penetrated into the child.
The child has already passed seven days towards death, he has completed
seven days of dying. He is moving towards death – sooner or later he
will be dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever comes in time becomes old. The moment it enters time, it
is already becoming old. Your body is old, your periphery is old. You
cannot be eternally in love with it. But your center is always fresh, it
is eternally young. Once you are in contact with it, love is an
every-moment discovery. And then the honeymoon never ends. If it ends it
was not a honeymoon at all – it was just an acquaintance.</p><p><br></p><p>And the last thing to remember is: in the relationship of love you
always blame the other if something goes wrong. If something is not
happening as it should, the other is responsible. This will destroy the
whole possibility of future growth.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember: you are always responsible, and change yourself. Drop those
qualities which create trouble. Make love a self-transformation.</p><p><br></p><p>As they say in salesmen’s courses: The customer is always right. I
would like to say to you: In the world of relationship and love, you are
always in the wrong, the other is always right.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is how lovers always feel. If there is love, they always
feel: Something is wrong with me if things are not happening as they
should. And both feel the same way! Then things grow, then centers open,
then boundaries merge.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you think that the other is wrong, you are closing yourself
and the other. And the other also thinks that you are wrong. Thoughts
are infectious. If you think the other is wrong even if you have not
said it, even if you are smiling and showing that you don’t think the
other is wrong – the other has got the point – through your eyes,
through your gestures, through your face. Even if you are an actor, a
great actor, and you can just arrange your face, your gestures as you
like, then too the</p><p>unconscious is continuously sending signals: You are wrong. And when
you say that the other is wrong, the other starts feeling that you are
wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Relationship is destroyed on this rock, and then people become
closed. If you say somebody is wrong, somebody starts protecting,
safeguarding. Then closure happens.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember always: in love, you are always wrong. And then the
possibility will open and the other will also feel the same. We create
the feeling in the other. When lovers are close, immediately thoughts go
jumping from one to the other. Even if they are not saying anything,
they are silent, they communicate.</p><p><br></p><p>Language is for non-lovers, those who are not in love. For lovers,
silence is enough language. Without saying anything, they go on
speaking.</p><p><br></p><p>If you take love as sadhana, then don’t say the other is wrong. Just
try to find out: somewhere, something must be wrong in you, and drop
that wrongness.</p><p><br></p><p>It is going to be difficult because it is going to be against the
ego. It is going to be difficult because it will hurt your pride. It is
going to be difficult because this will not be dominating, possessing.
You will not be more powerful through possessing the other. This will
destroy your ego – that’s why it is going to be difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>But destruction of the ego is the point, the goal. From wherever you
like to approach the inner world – from love, from meditation, from
yoga, from prayer – whatsoever the path you choose, the goal is the
same: the destruction of the ego, throwing the ego away.</p><p><br></p><p>Through love it can be done very easily. And it is so natural! Love
is the natural religion. Anything else is going to be more and more
unnatural. If you cannot work through love, it will be difficult for you
to work through anything else.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t think much about past lives, and don’t think much about the
future. The present is enough. Don’t think that relationship is coming
from the past – it is coming from the past, but don’t think about it
because then you will get more complicated. Make things easier.</p><p><br></p><p>It is going on – from your past lives things have a continuity, so I
don’t deny the fact, but don’t get burdened by it. It will continue in
the future, but don’t think about it. The present is more than enough.
Munch the cake and say: THIS cake is delicious. Don’t think of the past
and don’t think of the future; they will take care of themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing is discontinuous. You have been in relationships in the past.
You have loved, you have hated, you have made friends and you have made
enemies. That continues, known, unknown to you, it is always there. But
if you start brooding about it, you will miss the present moment.</p><p><br></p><p>So think as if there is no past, and think as if there is no future.
THIS moment is all that is given to you. Work it out, as if this moment
is all. Behave as if this moment is all and work out how you can
transform your energies into a loving phenomenon – this very moment.</p><p>People come to me and they want to know about their past lives. They
HAD past lives, but it is irrelevant. Why this inquiry? What are you
going to do about the past? Nothing can be done now. The past is past
and it cannot be undone. You cannot change it. You cannot go back.
That’s why nature, in its wisdom, doesn’t allow you to remember past
lives. Otherwise you would go mad.</p><p><br></p><p>You may be in love with a girl. If you suddenly become aware that
that girl was your mother in your past life, things will become very
complicated. Then what to do? And when that girl has been your mother in
a past life, making love to her now will create guilt. Not making love
to her will also create guilt, because you love her.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I say nature in its wisdom never allows you to remember
your past lives – unless you come to a point where it can be allowed,
when you become so meditative that nothing disturbs you, then the gates
open and all your past lives are before you. It is an automatic
mechanism, though sometimes the mechanism doesn’t work. Through
accidents some children are born who can remember. But their lives are
destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>One girl was brought to me a few years ago. She remembered her past
two lives. She was only thirteen at that time, but if you looked in her
eyes they looked near about seventy – because she remembered seventy
years, two past lives.</p><p><br></p><p>Her body was thirteen years old, but her mind was seventy years old.
She couldn’t play with other children, because how can an old woman of
seventy play with children? She would talk and behave like an old woman.
And she was burdened, the worries of all those years in her mind.</p><p><br></p><p>She remembered so accurately that her two past families could be
found. One was in Assam, the other in Madhya Pradesh. And when she came
in contact with her old families, she became so much attached to them
that it became a problem; where should she live now?</p><p><br></p><p>I told the parents: Leave the girl with me for at least three weeks.
I will make an effort to help her forget, because this girl’s life will
be a perversion. She cannot fall in love with somebody – she is so old!
Your oldness is concerned with your memory. If the memory span is of
seventy years, then you feel like seventy. And she seemed so tortured –
her face, the features, all tortured. She seemed so ill at her center –
uneasy, uncomfortable. Everything seemed to be wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>But the parents were enjoying the whole thing, because people started
coming and the newspapers started giving the report. They were enjoying
the whole thing. They wouldn’t listen to me and I told them: This girl
will go mad.</p><p><br></p><p>They never brought the girl to me again. But after seven years, they
came – the girl had gone mad. They said: Now do something. I said: It is
now impossible to do anything. Now only death will be a help to her.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t remember because it would be difficult for you to manage.
Even in this life you are making such a mess – many lives remembered,
you would simply go mad. Don’t think about it. It is irrelevant
also.</p><p><br></p><p>The relevant point is: be here and now, and work out your way. If you
can work it out through relationship, beautiful. If you cannot work it
out through relationship, then work it out in your</p><p>loneliness. These are the two paths. Love means working out your path
through relationship. And meditation: working it out in your loneliness.
Love and meditation – these are the two paths.</p><p><br></p><p>Feel which will suit you. Then bring your total energies to it, and
move on that path. Question 2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>YOUR WORDS ARE SO BEAUTIFUL, YET WE FEEL THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER
COMMUNICATION HAPPENING WHEN YOU ARE TALKING TO US.</p><p><br></p><p>WOULD YOU TALK TO US ABOUT SILENT COMMUNICATION, AND HOW WE CAN
BECOME MORE OPEN TO IT.</p><p><br></p><p>It is always there. While I am talking to you, I am also BEING to
you. Talking is relating to you through the intellect, and being is
relating to you with my totality.</p><p><br></p><p>While you are listening to me, if you are really listening, then it
is not only a listening to the words. Listening to me, your mind stops.
Listening to me, you are not thinking. When you are not thinking, you
are open. And when you are not thinking and your mind is not
functioning, you start feeling. Then I can overwhelm you, I can move and
fill you. Words are used only as a device.</p><p><br></p><p>I myself am not interested much in words. But I have to speak,
because this has been my feeling: while I am speaking you become silent.
If I am not speaking, then you are speaking within and you are not
silent.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are silent without my speaking then there will be no need to
speak. I am waiting for that moment when you can just sit by my side,
just sit near me, not thinking. Then there is no need to talk – because
talk is partial. Then I can come in my totality to you, directly, no
need for any mediating words.</p><p><br></p><p>But if I tell you to sit silently near me, you will not be able to
sit silently. You will go on chattering, you will go on talking within.
An inner talk will continue. To stop your inner talk I have to talk to
you, so while I am talking you are engaged.</p><p><br></p><p>My talking is just like a toy given to a child. He goes and plays
with the toy, and becomes silent, absorbed. I give you my words as toys.
You play with them, and while you are playing with them you are so
absorbed that you become silent. Whenever silence happens, I can flow
into you.</p><p><br></p><p>Words can be beautiful, but they can never be true. Beauty is an
aesthetic value. You can enjoy it, just like a beautiful painting, but
nothing much will happen out of that enjoyment. It is good as far as it
goes, but words are never true. They cannot be by their very nature.
Truth can be communicated only in silence.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is the paradox: all those who have insisted that truth can
be communicated only in silence have all used words. This is a shame,
but nothing can be done about it. Words have to be used</p><p>to make you silent. While listening to me you become silent. That
silence is significant, and that silence will give you glimpses of
truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if you have glimpses of truth through my words, that glimpse
comes through your silence, not through my words. Even if you feel
absolutely certain that whatsoever I am saying is true, that feeling of
absolute certainty comes through your silence, not through my words.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you are silent, truth is there. Whenever you are chattering
inside, the monkey-chatter goes on inside, you miss the truth which is
always present.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever I do – talk to you, help you to meditate with me, force
you into a catharsis, or persuade you to dance, to celebrate –
whatsoever I do, there is only one aim: somehow to help you to become
silent, because whenever you are silent, doors are open; you are in the
temple.</p><p><br></p><p>How you become silent is not relevant. You become silent and then I
am within you, you are within me. Silence knows no boundaries. In
silence, love is happening. I have become a lover to you; you have
become a lover to me. In silence, all that is significant happens. But
to bring silence is a problem, arduous.</p><p><br></p><p>So I am not much interested in what I say to you. I am interested in
what happens to you while I am saying anything – x, y, z. Sometimes I go
on contradicting myself. Today I say something, tomorrow I will say
something else because what I say is not the point. My talking is just
like poetry. I am not a philosopher. I may be a poet, but I am not a
philosopher.</p><p><br></p><p>Tomorrow I will say something else; the day after tomorrow something
else. That is not the point. My sayings may contradict, but I am not
contradictory – because today I say something and you become silent;
tomorrow I say something absolutely contradictory and you become silent;
the day after tomorrow I again say something absolutely contradictory,
all that I have said contradicts it, but you become silent. Your silence
is my consistency.</p><p><br></p><p>I am consistent, constantly consistent; contradicting on the surface,
but the inner current remains the same.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, if I say the same thing every day to you, you will not
be silent. Then you will get bored and your inner talk will start. If I
go on saying the same thing, it will become old. When it is old you need
not listen to it, or even without listening you know what I am saying,
so you can continue your inner talk.</p><p><br></p><p>I have to be inventive, saying things, shocking you sometimes, but
one inner consistency remains, that is to create silence in you –
because then I can be with you and you can be with me. The love, the
truth can flower there. Whenever there is silence, truth flowers. Truth
is a flowering of silence.</p><p><br></p><p>Enough for today.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

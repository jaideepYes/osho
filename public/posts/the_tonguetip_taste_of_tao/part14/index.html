Meditation is wrong when it is a ritual, when it is not of the heart. Meditation is right when it arises out of your heart and is not imposed by the mind, when it is not a ritual. The mind can only do rituals; it is very clever in creating rituals. And once one is caught in rituals the heart closes. The heart knows no rituals. The heart never moves in a groove – it is always new. The heart is always in a flow – it is never a pond; it is a river. In a pond only scum gathers and the pond becomes dirtier every day, but the river goes on flowing, remains pure; in its very flow is the purity. The heart is a river. The real meditation is also river-like. It is a flow – it is not stagnant: it is dynamic.\nSo one should listen to the heart. One should not make a determined effort to meditate; one should allow meditation to happen. One knows when it comes. When it comes on its own, it has tremendous beauty, and when it is forced, it is just an empty gesture. One can decide every day to meditate early in the morning at the same time at the same place with the same ritual. It will become a dead habit: you will go on repeating it every day, year in, year out. You will not gain anything out of it. Only one thing will happen: if some day you miss it, the whole day you will feel disturbed, that’s all. That is a very negative phenomenon. You will miss it because the mind always wants to move in a certain settled pattern. You will miss it as a smoker misses a cigarette if he has not smoked... but it is not meditation.\nOne has to be in a passive receptivity for twenty-four hours. Meditation has nothing to do with time, place. It has something to do with you, your inner space. So whenever you are free of the day to day routine, relax and allow it to happen. It can happen any place, any time, because it is non- temporal and it is non-spatial too. The right meditation knows no limitation, and slowly slowly the flow becomes more and more conscious. Then whatsoever you are doing remains on the surface; deep down the river goes on flowing. Even in the marketplace, surrounded by all kinds of turmoil, you are utterly silent. Even when somebody is insulting you, offending you, trying to provoke you,\ndeep down there is calmness; something remains undisturbed. Even when there are a thousand and one distractions, at the centre nothing is distracted. But that meditation cannot be managed by the mind; it can only be allowed by the heart.\nThis moment is meditation – it is there! You have not done anything for it to happen; it is happening on its own. In this moment there is no time. In this moment you are transported. In this moment you can feel that quiet, that serenity, that transcendence. So you are already having the taste of it. Yes, it is a tongue-tip taste... but even if one drop falls in, it brings the message that the ocean will be following...\nBut continue what I have said to you. Just whenever you have the feel – sitting under a tree or just sitting in your room or listening to music or looking at the sky or the sunset... And whenever it knocks on your door just remain open and let it happen. It will be happening more and more often, and slowly slowly it becomes a permanent guest.\nVeet means beyond, marg means the path. Truth is beyond any path, because truth is not there but here... truth is not then but now. You are not to go anywhere to find the truth, so no path is needed at all. Truth is your inner nature – it has only to be remembered. It is already the case.\nSo people who go on seeking for truth are seeking in vain. In fact, when all seeking stops truth is found, because seeking is also a kind of desire. When you seek you are going away from yourself. When you are not in a seeking at all then you are exactly where you are and it is there that truth is revealed.\nThe seeker and the sought are not different – the seeker is the sought. [Love is the language of spirituality, Osho tells Sahido of her name]\nAnd each of my sannyasins has to become a personification of love – a god of love, a goddess of love. Less than that won’t do, and less than that one need not be contented with. One should aspire to the total fulfilment of one’s being. It is possible and it is within our grasp. All that is needed is a little groping and one finds it. That groping has already started, that’s why you have come to me. You have found me, you have found the doorSannyas is a door – a door to the divine.\nMuch is going to happen! just allow it to happen. Don’t resist. The only stupid and silly thing that a person can do here is to resist me. Then it becomes impossible. I cannot force it on you – I can only seduce you into it.\nSo be ready!\n[A sannyasin says: My belly is so full and I think that my energy’s there; it doesn’t move from there.]\nIt will start moving. No problem is there. It is just gathering there, and the movement is possible only when it has gathered into a big enough quantity, otherwise it cannot move. But it has started gathering. That’s how it starts with everybody. When it is too much and the stomach cannot contain it, then it starts moving upwards, otherwise it cannot move. The upward movement is possible only when your lower system cannot contain it.\nIt is just as the level of water rises behind a dam when too much water is there. The upward movement is against gravitation, so only when it is too much does it start moving. But it is gathering and soon you will see the movement coming. When it comes, don’t be afraid.\n[Deva Prem] It means divine love. And my whole work consists of transforming you into divine love. That’s my alchemy – transforming people into love. The old alchemist used to transform lower metal, baser metal, into gold. I transform people into love – that’s real gold. My sannyasins have to become pure love. Their presence has to become the presence of love.\nJust to remind you again and again I have given you the name that unless divine love is expressed in each moment of your life, remember: the journey is incomplete and it has to be fulfilled. This is the task to be done, and when love is fulfilled, life is benediction... it is sheer joy.\n[Harisharan] It means at the feet of god, it means surrender, it means dropping your ego... and that is the only barrier between you and reality. The barrier is utterly false – it is just a notion, just an idea... as false as somebody thinking that two plus two are five. They are not, but while he thinks two plus two are five they appear to be five; at least he believes they are five. And because he thinks wrongly, he moves wrongly; his whole life goes wrong. Not that two and two have become five. They are four, but if you think that they are five you will be moving in a wrong direction. Man is in god; there is no other way of being. But we think we are separate. That very thinking creates trouble. The moment you drop that thinking, life is transformed, life becomes luminous. You have one of the most beautiful names – at the feet of god. Practise it and cultivate that approach and attitude of surrender.\n[A sannyasin says: I am afraid that I have become separate from other people.]\nMm mm... nothing to be worried about. You are just dropping the unnecessary activity in which you were involved. The essential will remain; the non-essential is a wastage. Ninety percent of people’s activities are utterly useless; not only useless but harmful too. That’s what you call socialising, meeting with people, relating, talking, conversation, and it is almost rubbish. It is good that it drops; when one becomes a little alert, it drops!\nIt is like somebody is suffering from a high fever – one hundred and five degrees – and is shouting and thrashing about in the bed. Then the fever cools down and he comes to ninety-eight – normal – and he thinks that all life is gone because he is no more thrashing and no more saying that his bed is flying into the sky, that ghosts are standing around. He is no more in a delirium. Certainly it will feel a little poor, because all those people were surrounding him and he was flying in the sky and talking to gods... all is gone and he is just normal!\nThat’s what is happening to you: the delirium is gone – you are becoming normal. And now only real relationships will remain and they are worth something. One need not have a crowd around oneself. A few deep intimate relationships are enough; they are really fulfilling. In fact because people don’t have intimate relationships, they have many relationships to substitute. But the real intimacy cannot be substituted. You can have one thousand friends – that will not make for one real friend. But that’s what people are doing: they think that quantity can become a substitute for quality. It never does, it cannot. Quantity is quantity; quality is quality. So now only very qualitative relationships will be possible, otherwise you will slip out.\nBut this is good – nothing to be afraid about. Be happy about it. Rather than talking the whole day, unnecessarily gossiping, you will be talking telegraphically. But those words will be meaningful – they will have intensity and passion and depth-and profundity. You may not speak a lot – you may become a man of few words, but those few words will be significant.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1762","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_tonguetip_taste_of_tao/part14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_tonguetip_taste_of_tao/>The Tongue-Tip Taste of Tao</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">14</h1><div class=post-meta>9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1762 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_TongueTip_Taste_of_Tao/part14.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Man comes without any name – the name is given here. It is useful but not real. But the mind has the tendency to become attached to all kinds of unrealities. It becomes attached to the name too, and that becomes one of the greatest problems.\nOne has to rediscover one’s namelessness, because to discover it is to discover the truth. The moment you know your namelessness you have also known your formlessness. And to be in that space is to be infinite. That’s what meditation is: a rediscovery of the original, a rediscovery of the source of our being.\nDeva means divine, viramo means let-go, relaxation – a state of divine let-go. And once one knows how to be in let-go, then for the first time life starts happening. We are unnecessarily striving to attain something; in fact the very effort to attain it is the hindrance. Life happens – it cannot be attained. The more one strives for it, the less one has it. One need not go to it, it comes on its own. All that is needed is a total state of receptivity, of openness. One has to become a host to life. It need not be chased. In chasing is misery; the more you chase it, the farther away it goes.\nAnd life contains all. It contains god, it contains bliss, it contains benediction, it contains beauty, good, truth, or what you will – it contains all; there is nothing other than life. Life is the name of the totality of existence.\nOne has to learn to be patiently relaxed and then the miracle of miracles happens: one day suddenly when you are really relaxed, something changes. A curtain disappears and you see things as they are.\nIf you chase, your eyes are too full of desires, expectation, longing; they cannot see the truth. The eyes are covered with the dust of desire. When there is no dust of desire, not even the desire for\ngod, not even the desire to be blissful, when one simply is – there is no movement of desire, all movement has ceased – that is the state of let-go. One simply is. Like a tree is or a river is or a mountain is, one simply is. Sitting silently, doing nothing... and life explodes. It comes rushing from every nook and corner of existence.\nAnd that is the moment of ecstasy or call it the meeting with god. All search is futile. Search is a byproduct of the mind. To be in a state of non-search is the great moment of transformation.\nAll the meditations that we are doing here are just preparations for that moment. They are not real meditations but just preparations so that one day you can simply sit, doing nothing, desiring nothing. And when there is no movement of desire, the mind ceases to exist, because the mind is nothing but the movement of desire.\nJust visualise a moment when there is no movement, time has stopped, one simply is. In that very is-ness god comes in. That is the meaning of ‘viramo’.\nDeva means divine, madhumaya means full of divine sweetness.\nThe mind is bitter – the heart is sweet. The more one enters into the heart, the more one’s life starts becoming sweet. In many ways the sweetness starts expressing itself – in love, in poetry, in song, in dance, in celebration; these are all manifestations of the sweetness of the heart.\nAnd the miracle is that the more you give your sweetness to existence, the more it comes to you from some unknown hidden source. The more you share, the more you have; the less you share, the less you have. And the people who never share their sweetness simply forget all about it; they become bitter. They are continuously angry; full of hate, jealousy, and all kinds of feverish poisons. But the basic reason is that they have forgotten their heart. They have become stuck in the head, and the head cannot experience anything beautiful. It is a calculative machine, it is a mechanism. It knows nothing of poetry; it cannot know anything of love. And because we go on living through the head, all poetry slowly slowly disappears.\nEach child is born a poet, a dancer, a singer, full of the sweetness of life, but sooner or later all that disappears and every child is turned into a robot which functions efficiently and then dies efficiently... which lives safely and dies safely... which never comes to know the fantastic mysteries of life, which simply comes and passes blindfolded through life. Only the people of the heart know what a blessing this existence is.\nAnd you can easily live through the heart. It is not going to be in any way difficult for you to move to the heart; it is very simple. And this is going to happen through sannyas.\nSo this is initiation into the heart. It is a rebirth, a movement from the head to the heart. Allow it to happen. Be here, utterly mad with love, joy... and god loves mad people!\nDeva means divine, anurago means love – divine love. My observation is this, that there are three stages of love. One is the love of the child; it is one-sided. The child only receives – he cannot give. He has no idea of giving; he can be forgiven. He will have to learn... but very few people learn. They remain childish for their whole life – they are always asking.\nThe person who has not gone beyond that childish attitude of love is immature. He may be one hundred years old; that doesn’t matter. If love is still a demand in his mind, of ‘You should give it to me’ then he is immature, retarded... certainly retarded in the heart. He may not be retarded in the head but the heart has remained crippled. The child’s idea of love is the idea of a need. It is his survival. He does not know anything more about love. He cannot survive without it. He needs the food, he needs the mother, and the caring and everything. It is a need; it is the lowest kind of love.\nThen the second kind of love arises when a person has become really grown-up. Very few people, very few become really grown up... when love is mutual, give and take; there is a balance. It is not only a need. The need is still there but not only the need. Now a new need has arisen; to give it. One enjoys getting it – one enjoys giving it. Unless this balance happens the man is not yet grown-up.\nAnd then the third stage, which very few people attain, is the love of the old person. He simply gives, his only need is to share and shower. He has moved to the opposite polarity from the child. The young man is just in the middle of the whole spectrum. The child is at one pole, the old person is at the other pole, but very few people really become old. To become aged is one thing; to really become old in wisdom is totally another.\nAnd that has to be done. Now this is the time for you to simply share love. When love is free of all kinds of needs, it has a beauty. It is tremendously spiritual... it is no more part of the marketplace. The child’s love is almost like food; it is synonymous with food. The young man’s love is a mutual arrangement – ‘You give me. I will give it to you. You scratch my back I will scratch your back’ – it is a mutual contract. It is still part of the marketplace... better than the child’s, because he is ready to give something. Although he gives only to get – it is a bargain – at least he invests something in it.\nThe real maturity of love happens when you are capable of simply giving, just for the giving’s sake. The joy is in the giving. Not that the love does not come back – it comes back one thousandfold. When you can give just for the sheer joy of giving, it pours from every corner of existence towards you: the skies and the trees and the moon and the sun, they all start pouring it. That is the meaning of your name: become divine love.\nThe child’s love is animal. No animal goes beyond that. The moment the children of the animals are ready to be on their own they forget all about parents and all about the family; they simply disappear. Their need is fulfilled. And they don’t know the love, the romantic phase of love that young human beings know. It remains a sexual phenomenon, done in a hurried way, in fact, without any pleasure in it... almost a natural instinct, functioning automatically. There is no mutual give and take; there is nothing really. It is just a natural instinct which forces them to make love. It is not love at all – it is only reproductive.\nIt is only in man that the second love, the human love, arises. No animals make love face to face except man, and it is because of making love face to face that the family has arisen; otherwise it cannot arise. The animals don’t become acquainted with each other. They never look into the eyes of each other while making love to see what is happening to the other; there is no concern with the other. It is a mechanical need which they fulfil, then they are gone on their own ways, never to meet again.\nIt is only man who makes love face to face, who encounters the other, sees the face of the other and\nthe ecstasies of love... who looks into the eyes of the other and tries to have some inner contact with the other. It is human love.\nDivine love means that now there is no question of nature, no animal need, no human need either, but one is simply having so much energy that one enjoys sharing it. Now one is freed from all natural boundaries; it is pure poetry, and pure poetry is prayer.\nDeva means divine, gatyo means movement – divine movement. People become stagnant, and they become stagnant very early in their life. The day a man’s being becomes stagnant, for all practical purposes he is dead. The average psychological age of humanity is only thirteen years. That means that almost everybody becomes stagnant at the age of thirteen. Then the body goes on growing but the mind no more moves. But this is the average; there are many who have stopped at seven, many who have stopped even at five. And there are a very few rare people, who go on growing for their whole life to the very end. Even when they are dying they are growing; they are growing even in their death. Even their death is a growing experience.\nThat’s what I mean by ‘divine movement’. One should remain moving. The river remains pure because it goes on moving, and the stagnant pool sooner or later becomes dirty. It is bound to become dirty; there is no way to avoid it. Movement is the process of purification, and if the movement can be without motivation then it is divine. There are many people who go on moving but their movement may not be divine.\nFor example a person who is after money has great movement in his life – he goes on rushing, but it is not divine movement; his object makes it ordinary. Or there are people who are interested in power, political power, and they cannot be satisfied unless they become the president of the country or the prime minister. They go on moving, running, their whole life, with great speed, with great vigour, and they are ready to do anything for it, but still, that movement is not divine.\nWhat movement is divine? – a movement which has no motivation, but is for the sheer joy of movement. It is just as if you have gone for a morning walk. There is no goal, you are not going to some target, you are not going anywhere. You can go to the north, or to the south, east or west or anywhere, because it is just a morning walk. You are just feeling happy with the morning sun and the morning breeze and the morning sky and the birds and the trees. You are enchanted with the beauty that has happened again – the miracle of the day again... you are enjoying it. You can turn back from any point.\nThis is sheer movement, with no goal, with no motivation. When there is no motivation the movement is limited, directed, narrow. When there is no motivation one is simply overflowing. That movement I call divine. And a man should be a great river of life, with no motivation... moving as a dance. Then each moment is a joy... then at each step there are surprises. Then life never becomes misery and one never gathers dirt, scum, mud. One remains a pure mirror, and in that pure mirror the beauty of existence is reflected.\nThere is a story about Alexander the Great that he had a mirror in which the beauty of the whole existence was reflected. It may be just a story... but I know that there is a certain mirror in which the beauty of the whole existence is reflected. I have that mirror – you can also have it. And one thing is certain. Alexander the Great did not have it... because it is not something outside that you can\npossess. Buddha had it, Jesus had it, but not Alexander the Great. But the story is beautiful. There is a possibility of a heart so dean that it can reflect all the splendour.\nRemember it: never get stuck anywhere, never look back, never cling to the past. Remain open, moving. Remain always an enquirer, an adventurer. Never arrive at conclusions... Let your life become a quest.\nDeva means divine, sarito means river – a divine river. Every river reaches to the ocean, and every river reaches to the ocean without any guide, without any map. Man too can reach to the ocean, but man becomes entangled on the way; and there are a thousand and one entanglements on the way. The guide, the master, is needed not to take you to the ocean – that can happen on its own; the master is needed to keep you alert not to get entangled on the way, because there are a thousand and one attractions.\nThe river goes on moving. A beautiful tree comes – the river enjoys the tree and moves on; it does not become attached to the tree, otherwise the movement will stop. It comes to a beautiful mountain but it goes on... utterly thankful, grateful to the mountain and the joy of passing through the mountain and all the song that happens to it and the dance. Grateful, certainly grateful, but not attached at all. It goes on moving... its movement doesn’t stop.\nThe problem with human consciousness is that you come across a beautiful tree and you want to make your home there; now you don’t want to go anywhere. You come across a beautiful man or a woman and become attached. The master is needed to remind you again and again not to become attached to anything. And it does not mean not to enjoy anything. In fact if you become attached you will not be able to enjoy; you can enjoy only if you remain unattached, untethered.\nAttachment destroys all joy, because nobody can enjoy anything that brings bondage, that goes against our inner being. Our inner being longs for freedom, so whatsoever prevents the freedom, we are angry at. That’s why lovers fight, fight continuously: they are angry at each other, and the anger is that they have become bondages to each other. They may not be conscious of why they are fighting. They may find small excuses to fight. Those excuses mean nothing – the basic thing is that they have become attached to each other and the attachment brings bondage and bondage is ugly and nobody wants to be a slave.\nMy whole teaching consists of two things: how to be in love and yet free – freedom and love. The intelligent person is one who has managed both together without sacrificing either for the other. The person who sacrifices his freedom for love is stupid. And so is the person who sacrifices love for his freedom; he is also stupid. The worldly people are stupid and the other-worldly people are stupid, because they have not shown any sign of intelligence. Intelligence means that you can have the cake and eat it too; then only are you intelligent.\nLove is absolutely harmonious with freedom; there is no problem. Freedom is harmonious with love; there is no problem. In fact, love cannot exist without freedom – sooner or later it dies. And freedom cannot exist without love; they nourish each other. Certainly there is no cause and effect relationship between them, but there is what Carl Gustav Jung calls ‘synchronicity’: in a certain,, subtle, mysterious way they nourish each other. There is no visible bridge, but if one is there the other is needed. If the other is not there one can only be there for a short time and soon it will disappear.\nSo be a river, flowing towards the ocean, towards god, the infinity, and yet be utterly in love with the banks you will be passing by... the trees, the mountains, the days and the nights and the people. Be utterly in love with all that and yet don’t get entangled anywhere; let the flow remain unhindered.\nOne who can manage love and freedom together is wise, and that becomes possible through meditation. Meditation is the key that unlocks love, unlocks freedom; it is a master key.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3064","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_tonguetip_taste_of_tao/part15/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_tonguetip_taste_of_tao/>The Tongue-Tip Taste of Tao</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">15</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3064 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_TongueTip_Taste_of_Tao/part15.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part14>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

this is going to happen through sannyas.</p><p><br></p><p>So this is initiation into the heart. It is a rebirth, a movement
from the head to the heart. Allow it to happen. Be here, utterly mad
with love, joy... and god loves mad people!</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine, anurago means love – divine love. My observation
is this, that there are three stages of love. One is the love of the
child; it is one-sided. The child only receives – he cannot give. He has
no idea of giving; he can be forgiven. He will have to learn... but very
few people learn. They remain childish for their whole life – they are
always asking.</p><p><br></p><p>The person who has not gone beyond that childish attitude of love is
immature. He may be one hundred years old; that doesn’t matter. If love
is still a demand in his mind, of ‘You should give it to me’ then he is
immature, retarded... certainly retarded in the heart. He may not be
retarded in the head but the heart has remained crippled. The child’s
idea of love is the idea of a need. It is his survival. He does not know
anything more about love. He cannot survive without it. He needs the
food, he needs the mother, and the caring and everything. It is a need;
it is the lowest kind of love.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the second kind of love arises when a person has become really
grown-up. Very few people, very few become really grown up... when love
is mutual, give and take; there is a balance. It is not only a need. The
need is still there but not only the need. Now a new need has arisen; to
give it. One enjoys getting it – one enjoys giving it. Unless this
balance happens the man is not yet grown-up.</p><p><br></p><p>And then the third stage, which very few people attain, is the love
of the old person. He simply gives, his only need is to share and
shower. He has moved to the opposite polarity from the child. The young
man is just in the middle of the whole spectrum. The child is at one
pole, the old person is at the other pole, but very few people really
become old. To become aged is one thing; to really become old in wisdom
is totally another.</p><p><br></p><p>And that has to be done. Now this is the time for you to simply share
love. When love is free of all kinds of needs, it has a beauty. It is
tremendously spiritual... it is no more part of the marketplace. The
child’s love is almost like food; it is synonymous with food. The young
man’s love is a mutual arrangement – ‘You give me. I will give it to
you. You scratch my back I will scratch your back’ – it is a mutual
contract. It is still part of the marketplace... better than the
child’s, because he is ready to give something. Although he gives only
to get – it is a bargain – at least he invests something in it.</p><p><br></p><p>The real maturity of love happens when you are capable of simply
giving, just for the giving’s sake. The joy is in the giving. Not that
the love does not come back – it comes back one thousandfold. When you
can give just for the sheer joy of giving, it pours from every corner of
existence towards you: the skies and the trees and the moon and the sun,
they all start pouring it. That is the meaning of your name: become
divine love.</p><p><br></p><p>The child’s love is animal. No animal goes beyond that. The moment
the children of the animals are ready to be on their own they forget all
about parents and all about the family; they simply disappear. Their
need is fulfilled. And they don’t know the love, the romantic phase of
love that young human beings know. It remains a sexual phenomenon, done
in a hurried way, in fact, without any pleasure in it... almost a
natural instinct, functioning automatically. There is no mutual give and
take; there is nothing really. It is just a natural instinct which
forces them to make love. It is not love at all – it is only
reproductive.</p><p><br></p><p>It is only in man that the second love, the human love, arises. No
animals make love face to face except man, and it is because of making
love face to face that the family has arisen; otherwise it cannot arise.
The animals don’t become acquainted with each other. They never look
into the eyes of each other while making love to see what is happening
to the other; there is no concern with the other. It is a mechanical
need which they fulfil, then they are gone on their own ways, never to
meet again.</p><p><br></p><p>It is only man who makes love face to face, who encounters the other,
sees the face of the other and</p><p><br></p><p>the ecstasies of love... who looks into the eyes of the other and
tries to have some inner contact with the other. It is human love.</p><p><br></p><p>Divine love means that now there is no question of nature, no animal
need, no human need either, but one is simply having so much energy that
one enjoys sharing it. Now one is freed from all natural boundaries; it
is pure poetry, and pure poetry is prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine, gatyo means movement – divine movement. People
become stagnant, and they become stagnant very early in their life. The
day a man’s being becomes stagnant, for all practical purposes he is
dead. The average psychological age of humanity is only thirteen years.
That means that almost everybody becomes stagnant at the age of
thirteen. Then the body goes on growing but the mind no more moves. But
this is the average; there are many who have stopped at seven, many who
have stopped even at five. And there are a very few rare people, who go
on growing for their whole life to the very end. Even when they are
dying they are growing; they are growing even in their death. Even their
death is a growing experience.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what I mean by ‘divine movement’. One should remain moving.
The river remains pure because it goes on moving, and the stagnant pool
sooner or later becomes dirty. It is bound to become dirty; there is no
way to avoid it. Movement is the process of purification, and if the
movement can be without motivation then it is divine. There are many
people who go on moving but their movement may not be divine.</p><p><br></p><p>For example a person who is after money has great movement in his
life – he goes on rushing, but it is not divine movement; his object
makes it ordinary. Or there are people who are interested in power,
political power, and they cannot be satisfied unless they become the
president of the country or the prime minister. They go on moving,
running, their whole life, with great speed, with great vigour, and they
are ready to do anything for it, but still, that movement is not
divine.</p><p><br></p><p>What movement is divine? – a movement which has no motivation, but is
for the sheer joy of movement. It is just as if you have gone for a
morning walk. There is no goal, you are not going to some target, you
are not going anywhere. You can go to the north, or to the south, east
or west or anywhere, because it is just a morning walk. You are just
feeling happy with the morning sun and the morning breeze and the
morning sky and the birds and the trees. You are enchanted with the
beauty that has happened again – the miracle of the day again... you are
enjoying it. You can turn back from any point.</p><p><br></p><p>This is sheer movement, with no goal, with no motivation. When there
is no motivation the movement is limited, directed, narrow. When there
is no motivation one is simply overflowing. That movement I call divine.
And a man should be a great river of life, with no motivation... moving
as a dance. Then each moment is a joy... then at each step there are
surprises. Then life never becomes misery and one never gathers dirt,
scum, mud. One remains a pure mirror, and in that pure mirror the beauty
of existence is reflected.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a story about Alexander the Great that he had a mirror in
which the beauty of the whole existence was reflected. It may be just a
story... but I know that there is a certain mirror in which the beauty
of the whole existence is reflected. I have that mirror – you can also
have it. And one thing is certain. Alexander the Great did not have
it... because it is not something outside that you can</p><p><br></p><p>possess. Buddha had it, Jesus had it, but not Alexander the Great.
But the story is beautiful. There is a possibility of a heart so dean
that it can reflect all the splendour.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember it: never get stuck anywhere, never look back, never cling
to the past. Remain open, moving. Remain always an enquirer, an
adventurer. Never arrive at conclusions... Let your life become a
quest.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine, sarito means river – a divine river. Every river
reaches to the ocean, and every river reaches to the ocean without any
guide, without any map. Man too can reach to the ocean, but man becomes
entangled on the way; and there are a thousand and one entanglements on
the way. The guide, the master, is needed not to take you to the ocean –
that can happen on its own; the master is needed to keep you alert not
to get entangled on the way, because there are a thousand and one
attractions.</p><p><br></p><p>The river goes on moving. A beautiful tree comes – the river enjoys
the tree and moves on; it does not become attached to the tree,
otherwise the movement will stop. It comes to a beautiful mountain but
it goes on... utterly thankful, grateful to the mountain and the joy of
passing through the mountain and all the song that happens to it and the
dance. Grateful, certainly grateful, but not attached at all. It goes on
moving... its movement doesn’t stop.</p><p><br></p><p>The problem with human consciousness is that you come across a
beautiful tree and you want to make your home there; now you don’t want
to go anywhere. You come across a beautiful man or a woman and become
attached. The master is needed to remind you again and again not to
become attached to anything. And it does not mean not to enjoy anything.
In fact if you become attached you will not be able to enjoy; you can
enjoy only if you remain unattached, untethered.</p><p><br></p><p>Attachment destroys all joy, because nobody can enjoy anything that
brings bondage, that goes against our inner being. Our inner being longs
for freedom, so whatsoever prevents the freedom, we are angry at. That’s
why lovers fight, fight continuously: they are angry at each other, and
the anger is that they have become bondages to each other. They may not
be conscious of why they are fighting. They may find small excuses to
fight. Those excuses mean nothing – the basic thing is that they have
become attached to each other and the attachment brings bondage and
bondage is ugly and nobody wants to be a slave.</p><p><br></p><p>My whole teaching consists of two things: how to be in love and yet
free – freedom and love. The intelligent person is one who has managed
both together without sacrificing either for the other. The person who
sacrifices his freedom for love is stupid. And so is the person who
sacrifices love for his freedom; he is also stupid. The worldly people
are stupid and the other-worldly people are stupid, because they have
not shown any sign of intelligence. Intelligence means that you can have
the cake and eat it too; then only are you intelligent.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is absolutely harmonious with freedom; there is no problem.
Freedom is harmonious with love; there is no problem. In fact, love
cannot exist without freedom – sooner or later it dies. And freedom
cannot exist without love; they nourish each other. Certainly there is
no cause and effect relationship between them, but there is what Carl
Gustav Jung calls ‘synchronicity’: in a certain,, subtle, mysterious way
they nourish each other. There is no visible bridge, but if one is there
the other is needed. If the other is not there one can only be there for
a short time and soon it will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>So be a river, flowing towards the ocean, towards god, the infinity,
and yet be utterly in love with the banks you will be passing by... the
trees, the mountains, the days and the nights and the people. Be utterly
in love with all that and yet don’t get entangled anywhere; let the flow
remain unhindered.</p><p><br></p><p>One who can manage love and freedom together is wise, and that
becomes possible through meditation. Meditation is the key that unlocks
love, unlocks freedom; it is a master key.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part14>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

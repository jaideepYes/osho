OVERPOWERED BY SENSELESS FAITH AND LOVE, LISTLESSLY I WAIT, FEELING LIKE A FOOL. ARE THERE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BLIND FAITH, LOVE AND SURRENDER?\nThere is a state when you certainly feel like a fool, but this is the beginning of wisdom. Only fools think they are wise, and those who are wise become wise when they start thinking that they are fools. The moment you can feel that you are a fool wisdom has dawned upon you. Now you will change, now there will be transformation, now the possibilities open infinitely... because this is part of the foolish mind – not to realize the foolishness. And this is the beginning of a wise mind – to realize one’s ignorance, foolishness.\nSo this is good news that you realize that you are a fool, this is something worth attaining. The ego cannot exist now. The ego always exists with knowledgeability, one goes on feeling one knows without knowing.\nIt is reported that the oracle of Delphi declared Socrates the wisest man on the earth. So a few people, disciples of Socrates, came to him and said, “Socrates, be happy. The oracle has declared that you are the wisest man on the earth.”\nSocrates laughed and said, “Go back. There must have been some mistake. How can I be the wisest man? – because I know only one thing, that I don’t know anything, I am ignorant. So there has been some mistake. You go back and tell the oracle.”\nThey went back to the oracle and said, “Socrates himself has denied it, so there must be something erroneous. He says he is not wise, he says he realizes only one thing – that he is absolutely ignorant, he knows nothing. He claims only this much knowledge, that he knows nothing.”\nThe oracle said, “That’s why I have declared that he is the wisest man, that is the reason – because only the wisest can say that he does not know anything.”\nFools always claim knowledge. Only then, only there through their claim, can they hide their stupidity. So be happy if you feel that you are a fool and you can see your foolishness. The one who can see his foolishness has become separate from it; now foolishness exists apart. It is there but you are separate; you can witness it, you are not identified with it now. Consciously alert, everybody will see that he is a fool.\nSecondly, there is no difference between blind faith, love and surrender – because all differences belong to the intellect, all distinctions belong to the intellect. The heart knows no distinctions. Whether you call it blind faith or you call it surrender or you call it love depends on your intellect. The heart doesn’t know any distinction, the heart knows only the feelings – the feeling is the same.\nWhen do you call a faith blind? When? When the intellect says that this faith is wrong then the intellect calls it blind. When the intellect feels that some faith is justified by reason, then the intellect says that this faith is right. But does faith need any justification from reason? Is reason in any way the authority to know what is right and what is wrong in the world of feeling?\nAlways rationalists have said that the believers are blind – always. But have you known any believer who was not blind? People who were following Jesus were blind – everybody condemned them. Those who were following Buddha were blind, rationalists condemned them. Rationalists have always been saying that faith is blind. This is just a trick of logic to say that that faith is right which is not blind – but there is no such faith.\nThe very word faith means that where there are no grounds to believe, you believe. If there are grounds then there is no need for faith. For example, you don’t believe that the earth exists. Is it not a fact? There is no need for faith. The earth exists: this is a fact, justified, rational; faith is not needed. Faith comes only when the reason cannot justify but the heart feels it. And reason is not the totality, reason is not the total life and existence. There are things which go beyond reason, which reason cannot comprehend but which the heart feels.\nThere are only two ways: either you deny the heart or you deny reason. When reason and heart are in conflict, these are the two alternatives: either you follow reason and say to the heart that it is blind, and unless something is justified, proved, you are not going to believeBut do you know,\nwhenever something is rationalized, proved, there is no need to believe.\nMarx, the founder of communism, used to say, “I will not believe in God unless God is proved in a scientific laboratory.” But he knew it well, so he added, “Don’t try to prove God in a scientific way,\nbecause once you prove God in a scientific way, in a scientific laboratory, there will be no need to believe.” Do you believe in chemistry or physics? There is no need. Only the unproved needs faith; the heart feels that it is there but reason cannot prove it.\nI have loved very few sentences in my life – very few, rare, they can be counted on one’s fingers. One of these few sentences is one from Tertullian, one Christian mystic. He said, “I believe in God because God is absurd, because God cannot be believed, is impossible to prove. That’s why I believe.” ... Because if it is possible to prove there is no need to believe, then there are facts. The heart can feel and lead you. The reason will say heart is blind because reason thinks that only he has eyes, but the heart has its own eyes. When you love a person, love is always blind. Have you seen any love with eyes? A person who goes on following reason will never be in love.\nIt happened to Immanuel Kant, one of the greatest German thinkers. He was a complete rationalist. One woman loved Immanuel Kant and proposed marriage to him. He said, “Wait, because first I will have to think pro and con – whether marriage can lead to happiness or not. And unless I decide rationally I cannot take any step.”\nSo he thought and thought and brooded and contemplated, and he wrote at least one thousand pages for and against. And then he concluded that both the sides seemed to be almost equal, and a decision was difficult. So he went to find the woman to tell her that a decision was difficult and she would have to wait a little longer, but when he went there he found that she was already married and the mother of three children. Immanuel Kant remained unmarried; such a man cannot be in love. And this is the rationalist mind, one of the keenest minds – logical, logical to the very extreme – but if you start deciding with the mind, love cannot happen.\nTo reason, love is blind and for the heart, reason is foolish. For the heart reason is foolish, stupid; it may be useful as far as the market is concerned, but is not useful as far as life is concerned. So those who live in reason live in the market and all that transcends the market, is greater than the market, is beyond them. They never realize it, they never have a glimpse; that rainbow never arises in their lives, it goes beyond. They live in the mundane, the trivial. No poetry ever happens to them, no singing ever descends in their hearts, no dance is possible for them – ecstasy is not for them.\nSo it doesn’t matter what you call it – blind faith, love or surrender – call it whatsoever you like. Remember only one thing: it should arise from your feeling, and it cannot arise from your mind. And don’t force your mind to be the leader, don’t force reason to be the leader, because through mind you may become more powerful but you will be less happy. Through mind you may attain much wealth but you will remain poor within. Through mind you may rule thousands of people but you will not be a master like Buddha or Jesus – inside you will remain a slave.\nThis has to be chosen: if you want more power, more money, more prestige, follow reason; if you want more happiness, more bliss, more silence, more peace, more God, more ecstasy, then don’t listen to reason, follow the heart. They are two different dimensions and don’t try to confuse them. Decide well, and then follow one path. Can you be satisfied just by reason? Can only logic make you happy? Logic is simply dead, dry; one cannot live by logic alone. As Jesus says one cannot live by bread alone, I say one cannot live by logic alone. But you can try, and in that effort you will lose all that is life, all that is of worth, and all that can be felt as a blessing and beatitude.\n“Overpowered by senseless faith and love, listlessly I wait.” Nothing else can be done but there is no need to wait listlessly – you can wait ecstatically. This listlessness will come because reason goes on interfering. Reason goes on saying, “What foolishness are you doing? What are you doing here? Why are you waiting and wasting time?” That reason creates the listlessness, otherwise waiting can become a joy. The most joyous thing possible is waiting – hope throbbing, heart beating for the unknown, and you wait in silence with infinite patience.\nIf you can wait with joy there will not be much need to wait for long, if you cannot wait with joy you may have to wait for many lives – because the divine can happen to you only when your waiting is ecstatic, filled with joy. Just look at a woman waiting for her lover: she has faith, she has ecstasy – the eyes and the infinite patience and the happiness. Wait like a lover, only then is your waiting meaningful. Don’t wait listlessly, because if you are so listless your lover may come but will not find you worthy to be with. Only your joy can become the invitation. Wait blissfully, ecstatically, and then I say to you that you will not need more waiting. There will be no need, it can happen this very moment.\nIf your joy is total this very moment there is no need to wait. The divine will descend in you – you have fulfilled the condition. And this I call the condition: waiting with infinite patience, but ecstatically. This is the condition. Fulfill this and a single moment will not be lost.\nIt is said in old Egyptian books that whenever the disciple is ready the master appears. Whenever, wherever the disciple is ready the master appears. There is no need for the disciple to seek the master, it is always the master who seeks the disciple. Even if you go to the master, it is always the master who seeks you, who finds you.\nThe same is true for the divine happening: whenever you are ready it happens – God seeks you. He has always been seeking you. He has been following you, he has been waiting for you. Whenever you are ready the seed will sprout, the bud will become the flower. But getting ready means waiting – waiting is the only prayer you can do. But if you don’t believe you cannot wait. Only faith can wait. Reason always insists on things happening immediately. Heart can wait, there is no urgency for the heart.\nTry to understand this: time exists only for reason. For the heart there is no time, heart exists in timelessness. Only for reason is there time. So mind goes on insisting on haste, hurry, urgency, and mind is always tense. Time is going, flowing, life is becoming less and less every moment. Things should happen instantly – that is the insistence of reason. But the heart knows no time, there are no clocks for the heart. Heart exists timelessly, that’s why the heart can wait – the heart can wait infinitely.\nIf you love, if you have faith, if you trust, then there is no hurry, and then there is no need to wait listlessly. Why not dance while waiting? Why waste this time in listlessness? Why not dance? It will be better when your lover comes if your lover finds you dancing. It will be a good meeting, it will be the right moment.\nThe second question: Question 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nIF EVEN FIFTY PERCENT OF ALL PERSONS SHOULD BECOME ENLIGHTENED, DOES IT MEAN THAT FIFTY PERCENT WILL HAVE TO IMMEDIATELY BECOME IDIOTS? THE POLAR OPPOSITE THEORY DOESN’T SEEM TO GIVE MUCH HOPE TO MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT.\nYou misunderstood – but that is always more possible than to understand. Your mind moves immediately to the wrong conclusion, and you cannot help it, that’s how you have trained your mind. In all these talks I have been telling you that enlightenment means going beyond the polar opposites. So there is no state against enlightenment, it means transcending the division. We have been saying again and again that mind is enlightened only when it transcends division.\nIf fifty percent of persons are intelligent, then fifty percent will be foolish; if five percent are geniuses, then five percent will be idiots. But a genius is not enlightened – he is as unenlightened as the idiot, there is no difference. He may be an Einstein, he may have won Nobel prizes, but that doesn’t make any difference. Just by winning a Nobel prize you don’t become enlightened. A genius is as far away from enlightenment as an idiot. An idiot can also jump into enlightenment just as a genius can jump into it.\nIntelligence and stupidity are polar opposites. To enlightenment there is no polar opposite – it is transcendence of both. So there exists no state which is against enlightenment. Have you ever heard of anyone who is just the polar opposite to Buddha or Jesus? There is no one. The whole Vedanta, the whole of Upanishads’ teaching, the very doctrine is this: that when you transcend duality you attain a totally new dimension, nothing exists against it.\nIn Sanskrit we have three terms: dukkha which means pain, suffering, misery; sukkha which means happiness, pleasure, joy; and ananda which can be translated as bliss. Happiness is against misery, they are polar opposites. Bliss is not against anything, there is no state which is against bliss. If you are happy you will become miserable, if you are miserable you will become happy. You can move, this duality is there. But if you are blissful you cannot move anywhere – duality has disappeared. Against ananda, against bliss, there exists no state.\nEnlightenment is not against ignorance, it is against ignorance and knowledge both. It is beyond, not against. So a person who knows more is not enlightened, and a person who knows less is not unenlightened because he knows less. Wherever you are you can take the jump into enlightenment. So sometimes very uneducated people have also jumped, not very intelligent people have also jumped. The jump is needed.\nAnd sometimes it happens that a person who is not educated much is more courageous and can take the jump more easily than a person who knows too much. Just because he knows too much he becomes too afraid of taking risks, because he is so clever he becomes cunning also – cleverness creates cunningness. He becomes calculative, and on the path of the divine you cannot calculate. Only gamblers, only those who can jump without calculating, only those who can take risks, only they can enter.\nSo this question is just through your misunderstanding. In the world balance exists, but when you transcend the world you also transcend this polar balance. You go beyond the two, you become one.\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nDOES LAUGHTER BELONG TO EVERY STAGE?\nThis is worth considering, significant. The first thing to understand is that, except man, no animal is capable of laughter. Laughter shows a very high peak. If you go out on a street and you see a buffalo laughing you will be scared to death, and if you report it nobody is going to believe that it happened. It is impossible.\nWhy can’t animals laugh? Why can’t trees laugh? There is a very deep causality to the laughter; only that animal can laugh which can get bored. Animals and trees are not bored. Boredom and laughter – this is the polar duality, these are the polar opposites. Man is the only animal who is bored; boredom is the symbol of humanity. Look at dogs and cats – they are never bored. Man seems to be deep in boredom. Why are they not bored? Why does only man suffer boredom? And the higher your intelligence the more you will be bored, a lower intelligence is not bored so much. That’s why primitives are more happy.\nYou will find more happy people in a primitive society than in a civilized society; even a Bertrand Russell becomes jealous. When Bertrand Russell for the first time came in contact with some primitive tribes he started feeling jealous because they were so happy – not bored at all. Life was a blessing. They were poor, starved, almost naked; in every way they had nothing, but they were not bored with life. In Bombay, in New York, in London, everybody is bored – more intelligent, more civilized, more boredom.\nSo the secret can be understood: the more you can think, the more you will be bored, because through thinking you can compare – past, future, present. Through thinking you can hope, through thinking you can ask, “What is the meaning of it?” And the moment a person asks, “What is the meaning of it?” boredom will enter, because really there is no meaning in anything. If you ask the question, “What is the meaning of it?” you will feel meaninglessness. And when meaninglessness is felt you will be bored. Animals are not bored, trees are not bored, rocks are not bored. They never ask, “What is the meaning of life, what is the purpose of life?” They never ask so they never feel it is meaningless. As they are they accept it, as life is it is accepted. There is no boredom.\nMan feels bored, laughter is the antidote. You cannot live without laughter, because you can kill your boredom only through laughter. You cannot find a single joke in primitive societies, they don’t have any jokes. Jews have the largest number of jokes, they are the most highly bored people on the earth. But they must be so, because they win more Nobel prizes than any other community. The whole last century almost all the great names are Jews: Freud, Einstein, Marx – Jews. And look at the list of Nobel prizewinners – almost half the Nobel prizes go to the Jews. They have the largest number of jokes.\nAnd this may be the reason why all over the world Jews are hated – because everybody feels jealous of them. Wherever they are they will always win any type of competition, so everybody feels jealous\nof them, the whole world is united against them, feels hate for them. When you cannot compete with someone hate is the result. And they have the most beautiful jokes on the earth. Why? They must be feeling very bored; they have to create jokes – a joke is the antidote to feeling bored. Laughter is needed to exist, otherwise you will commit suicide.\nNow try to understand the mechanism of laughter, how it happens. If I tell a joke, why do you laugh? What happens? What is the inner mechanism? If I tell a joke, expectation is created, you start expecting. Your mind starts searching for what the end is going to be, and you cannot conceive the end. A joke moves in two dimensions: first it moves in a logical dimension, you can conceive it. If the joke goes on being logical to the very end there will be no laughter. Suddenly the joke takes a turn and becomes illogical, something which you could not conceive. And when the joke takes a turn and the result becomes illogical, the expectation, the tension that was created in you, suddenly explodes. You relax, laughter comes out of you.\nLaughter is a relaxation, but a tension is needed. A story creates expectation, tension. You start feeling that now the crescendo, now the crescendo will come, something is going to happen. Your backbone is straight like a yogi, you have no more thoughts in the mind; the whole being is just waiting, all the energy moving towards the conclusion. And all that you could conceive is not going to happen.\nSuddenly something happens which the mind could not conceive; something absurd happens, something illogical, irrational. The end is such a turn that it was impossible for logic to think about it. You explode. The whole energy that has become a pillar inside suddenly relaxes. Laughter comes out of you through this relaxation. Man is bored, hence he needs laughter. The more bored he is, the more and more laughter he will need, otherwise he cannot exist.\nThirdly, it has also to be understood about laughter that it is of three types. One, when you laugh at someone. This is the meanest, the lowliest, very ordinary and vulgar – when you laugh at somebody else’s cost. This is violent, aggressive, insulting. Deep down there is a revenge.\nSecondly, when you laugh at yourself. This is worth achieving, this is cultured, and the man who can laugh at himself is valuable. He has risen above vulgarity, he has risen above low instincts – hatred, aggression, violence.\nAnd thirdly, the highest laughter, which is not about anybody – neither the other nor oneself. The third is just cosmic, you laugh at the whole situation as it is. The whole situation as it is, is absurd – no purpose in the future, no beginning in the beginning. The whole situation of existence is such that if you can see the whole – such a great vastness, an infinite vastness, moving to no fixed purpose, moving to no goal; so much going on without leading anywhere; nobody in the past to create it, nobody in the end to finish it; a whole cosmos, and moving so beautifully, so systematically, so rationally – if you can see this whole cosmos, then a laughter arises.\nI have heard about three monks. No name is mentioned, because they never told their names to anybody, they never answered anything. So in China they are only known simply as “the three laughing monks.”\nThey did only one thing: they would enter a village, stand in the marketplace, and start laughing. Suddenly people would become aware and they would laugh with their whole being. Then others\nwould also get the infection, and then a crowd would gather, and just looking at them the whole crowd would start laughing. What is happening? Then the whole town would get involved, and they would move to another town. They were loved very much. That was their only sermon, the only message – that laugh. And they would not teach, they would simply create the situation.\nThen it happened they became famous all over the country – the three laughing monks. The whole of China loved them, respected them. Nobody had preached that way – that life must be just a laughter and nothing else. And they were not laughing at anybody in particular, but simply laughing as if they had understood the cosmic joke. They spread so much joy all over China without using a single word. People would ask their names but they would simply laugh, so that became their name, the three laughing monks.\nThen they became old, and in one village one of the three monks died. The whole village was very expectant, filled with expectations, because now at least when one of them had died they must weep. This would be something worth seeing, because no one could even conceive of these people weeping.\nThe whole village gathered. The two monks were standing by the side of the corpse of the third and laughing such a belly laugh. So the villagers asked, “At least explain this!”\nSo for the first time they spoke, and they said, “We are laughing because this man has won. We were always wondering who would die first, and this man has defeated us. We are laughing at our defeat, at his victory. He lived with us for many years, and we laughed together and we enjoyed each other’s togetherness, presence. There can be no other way of giving him the last send-off, we can only laugh.”\nThe whole village was sad, but when the dead monk’s body was put on the funeral pyre, then the village realized that not only were these two joking – the third who was dead was also laughing... because the third man who was dead had told his companions, “Don’t change my dress!” It was conventional that when a man died they changed the dress and gave a bath to the body, so he had said, “Don’t give me a bath because I have never been unclean. So much laughter has been in my life that no impurity can accumulate near me, can even come to me. I have not gathered any dust, laughter is always young and fresh. So don’t give me a bath and don’t change my clothes.”\nSo just to pay him respect they had not changed his clothes. And when the body was put on the fire, suddenly they became aware that he had hidden many things under his clothes and those things started... Chinese fireworks! So the whole village laughed, and those two said, “You rascal! You have died, but again you have defeated us. Your laughter is the last.”\nThere is a cosmic laughter when the whole joke of this cosmos is understood. That is the highest, only a buddha can laugh like that. These three monks must have been three buddhas. But if you can laugh the second, that too is worth trying. Avoid the first – don’t laugh at anyone’s cost, that is ugly and violent. If you want to laugh, laugh at yourself.\nThat’s why Mulla Nasruddin in every one of his jokes and stories always proves himself the stupid man in it, never anybody else. He always laughs at himself and allows you to laugh at him. He never puts anybody else in the situation of being foolish. Sufis say that Mulla Nasruddin is the wise fool. Learn at least that much – the second laughter.\nIf you can learn the second, the third will not be far ahead, soon you will reach the third. Leave the first laughter, that is degrading. But almost ninety-nine percent of the time you laugh the first one. Much courage is needed to laugh at oneself, much confidence is needed to laugh at oneself. For the spiritual seeker, even laughter should become a part of sadhana. Remember not to laugh the first laughter, remember to laugh the second – and remember to reach the third.\nThe fourth question:\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nCAN THERE BE MOMENTS OF EFFORTLESSNESS WHILE A SEEKER IS ENGAGED IN THE FIRST THREE STAGES? IS EFFORT COMPLETELY LACKING IN THE SECOND FOUR STAGES? DOES THERE COME A POINT AT WHICH BOTH EFFORT AND EFFORTLESSNESS MUST CEASE?\nFirst, there can be moments of effortlessness even while making effort. If you are total in your effort there will be glimpses of effortlessness. Suddenly effort will have disappeared for a moment, there will be a gap. If you are aware and look deep in the gap you will see. Just doing meditation here, I feel many of you achieve for a single moment effortlessness. You may not be aware, but try to be aware. While doing, a moment comes when you feel you are not doing it – as if it is happening.\nYou may have started it as a doing. When you start taking deep, fast chaotic breaths, of course, it is a fact that you start it. But have you observed that sometimes the breathing takes you, the mastery has changed? Now the breathing is going by itself, it has taken over. When you start the second stage, in the beginning there is effort to allow madness; even sometimes to imitate, to force, to do something because everybody else is doing. But you can watch: a moment comes to many, to at least ninety percent of people here, when the madness has taken over. You are not doing it, rather it is doing you. You are not the doer, it is moving by itself – then it is effortless. And when it is moving by itself it is beautiful, only then is the catharsis happening. When you are doing it is not catharsis, you are only starting it. When the madness has taken over and is on its own and the movement is going automatically, then it is catharsis – now the repressed energies are working. You may have started laughter in catharsis. Then a point comes when you feel that laughter is going by itself. You can watch it, it will continue. No need to do it, it is happening.\nSometimes fear grips at that moment, because then you feel you have gone insane. Up to that moment you are making effort, you are the master and you are not afraid. You know that you can stop it, you know that it is within your control, you are doing it. Fear enters whenever you feel that it has become automatic. You get scared, because now you see it may not stop, it may continue. Then what are you going to do? And if you become afraid you again start doing. And that’s why you cannot watch effortless moments.\nThere is one day left (OF THE MEDITATION CAMP); watch and don’t get afraid, because that is the right moment – when the catharsis is starting to happen, when you become scared. When things are coming out, immediately you close yourself and make all efforts again to do something. With the doing the mind is at ease; with the happening the mind is afraid, and effortlessness will mean\nhappening. But don’t be afraid, because any happening can be stopped – if you have started it, it can be stopped. So don’t get afraid.\nThat’s why my insistence that when I say “Stop!” stop completely – because if you cannot stop when I say stop it can be dangerous. I don’t want you to become mad, rather I want you to become saner through throwing madness out. You must remain in control. But don’t try, there is no need. If you have started it, this is the law: if you have started, you are deep inside in control. Don’t get scared, allow it to happen. Any moment it can be stopped.\nThat’s why after the third stage I always insist that when I say stop, when you hear the word stop, you stop, because that will make you the master and you will remain the master. Even while catharsis is happening you know that at any time you can push the button off. Once you become aware that the button can be put on and off you will never be afraid.\nMadness is there within everyone and the more you hide it the more you are vulnerable, the more you can go mad any moment. And if you go mad then you will not be the master. If you never started it then you cannot stop it. You can only stop that which you have started. If you have not started it you cannot stop it.\nSo don’t go on suppressing, because a quantity can be tolerated but there comes a moment when the quantity reaches the climax, the evaporating point – one hundred degrees. Then you start boiling and evaporating. Many persons who were just like you a day before are in madhouses now. You can be there any day. If you don’t allow catharsis you are all prone to go mad, because civilization is such, the situation is such, that everybody accumulates madness. You have to throw it every day to remain clean and pure, to retain the clarity of mind and vision.\nBut if you know the law that if you start a thing you can stop it, then you can start anything and you can stop. Be the master in the starting, you will be the master in the end also. But if a thing starts by itself then you cannot stop it, then you don’t know where the button is to turn on and off.\nAnd secondly, “Is effort completely lacking in the second four stages?”\nYes. In the first three effort is there, in the last four there is no effort. And if you make effort you will not grow in them. As without effort you will not grow in the first three, with effort you will not grow in the last four. Effort is helpful in the first three, effort is a hindrance in the last four. So one has to learn effort and then one has to learn to drop effort, because there are things for which effort cannot be made.\nFor example, you sow some seeds, some flower seeds; effort is needed because the seeds are to be sown. You choose the soil, you give water, sunrays, fertilizers; you arrange everything, you do everything. Effort is needed. But then the seeds sprout, you need not pull them to make them grow faster. You need not pull them, if you pull them they will die. Effort is not needed.\nAnd when buds come to your plant, don’t try to open them and make them flower. You will kill the whole thing. And if you open unripe buds those flowers will be ugly, there will be no fragrance and they will look artificial. You can do everything to help the plant but you need not make any positive effort to open the flowers. They will open by themselves. And when they open by themselves they\nwill be ripe, they will be ready to express themselves. Their fragrance, their beauty, their ecstasy will come out.\nThe same is the case in spiritual discipline. The first three stages are just to make the ground ready – seeds sown, every condition prepared – and the four end ones are just the flowering stages, they come by themselves. Don’t interfere with them by your effort, and don’t do anything positively. You simply wait and you will see that your inner consciousness is growing every moment.\nAnd thirdly, “Does there come a point at which both effort and effortlessness must cease?”\nYes. Effort is positive, effortlessness is negative. The first three stages are effort, the second three stages are effortless, and the seventh, the last, is neither. It is neither effort nor effortless, it is neither positive nor negative – it is the transcendence. The seventh is the transcendence. We will try to understand that tomorrow morning. The seventh is the transcendence. Nothing is needed – neither effort nor awareness not to make effort. Both have to be dropped.\nThe last question:\nQuestion 5 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHAT IS MOMENT-TO-MOMENT UNDERSTANDING IN RELATIONSHIP?\nA difficult question – because unless you learn to live moment to moment you cannot understand it. As we live, we live out of the past. If someone insults you, you immediately react. That reaction comes from your past experiences. It is not from you, it is from the chain of your experiences.\nIf someone is loving towards you, you become loving – that loving may be from the past experiences. So living moment to moment and understanding moment to moment in relationship comes only if you become aware of the past chain and don’t allow it to function. And always respond in the present, not through the past.\nFor example, someone insults you. Many people have insulted you in the past; there has come a wound in your heart, through all the insults a wound is created. This insult will also hit the wound, and then you will react. That reaction will not be justified because this man is not creating the wound. And if the wound is touched, the pain is not created by his insult really. It has been created by many insults and the reaction is accumulated; it is not justified.\nThat’s why it happens that if you react the other always feels, “Why are you reacting so much? I have not said anything.” You also know it: you are not aware that you have said something to someone which has become a hurt in him and he reacts. And you say, “You have misunderstood me, because I have not said anything to insult you. Why are you reacting? Are you mad?” But you don’t know. He has a wound, and when you hit the wound the whole pain comes towards you. The wound may have been created by many people – unknown, known, not remembered – but the whole wound is poured on this person. This is not justified.\nSo what will it be to respond immediately? It will be first to put aside the past. Look at this man with alertness so that the past doesn’t cloud you. Look at whatsoever he has said, dissect it, analyze it, in the light of the present. And it will be better if you can wait a little and meditate on it.\nIt happened once, one woman wrote a letter to an American author, Dale Carnegie. Dale Carnegie had delivered a lecture on the radio on Abraham Lincoln, and he had mentioned many wrong dates in it. The woman was a lover of Abraham Lincoln, so she wrote a very angry letter saying, “If you don’t know the abc of Abraham Lincoln’s life you should not go on the radio. And this is insulting. If you are not well informed, then first get informed and then start lecturing.”\nDale Carnegie was a man of fame, had written many bestsellers; he got offended, he was very angry. So he wrote a letter immediately in the same tone, the same anger, the same irritation. But it was late and the servant had gone, so he left the letter on the table. In the morning he would post it.\nIn the morning, when he was putting it in the envelope, he just looked once more at it. He felt, “This is too much. The woman has not written like this, she doesn’t deserve so much anger from me.” And in a way he felt she was right also. So he tore up the letter and wrote another which was totally different. There was no anger, no irritation in it, rather the attitude of thanking her for making him aware of some mistakes and he felt obliged. But then he thought, “If in twelve hours so much can change, there is no hurry. I can wait for a few more days.”\nSo he tried one experiment. He left the letter again on the table. By the evening he again read it and he wanted to change a few words again. For seven days he continued, and on the seventh day it became a love letter. And Dale Carnegie relates that that woman proved one of the best friends that he had ever had in his life. What would have happened if the servant had not gone and the letter had been posted? He would have created an enemy.\nWhen Gurdjieff’s father was dying he told Gurdjieff, “Only one message I give to you – and remember it!” Gurdjieff was very small, just nine years of age, and the father said, “I am not rich so I have nothing to give to you, only one advice which my father gave to me when he was dying. And this is the message: that if you get angry, don’t answer immediately, wait twenty-four hours. Then do whatsoever you like. Even if you want to kill the man, go and kill – but after twenty-four hours.”\nAnd Gurdjieff says, “In my whole life anger has not created any problem for me, because I have to wait twenty-four hours and then the whole thing seems foolish. And sometimes even the person who created anger seems to be right, so I go and thank him. Through anger I have not created a single enemy, and through anger there has been no complexity in my life.”\nSo alertness is needed in moment-to-moment relationship. Alertness is needed. Be alert! Don’t allow your past to come in between you and the person to whom you are relating. It will take time to become aware because the past is so swift, it enters so immediately, there is no time gap. Somebody says something and the past has entered, you have interpreted through the past. So move a little slowly. Look at the person, wait, absorb whatsoever has happened to you, meditate, and then respond in the present. Once you become efficient, once you know this key, you have one of the keys which can allow you to enter into the mystery, into the mysteries of other persons.\nEvery person is carrying such a mysterious being but the being is closed to you. Every person can become the door for the divine, any ordinary person is extraordinary. Just behind the surface\nthe mysterious is hidden, but you need a key to open it. And that key is moment-to-moment alert response. Not reaction – response. Reaction is always dead; you do something because he has done something. Response is totally different.\nI will tell you one anecdote.\nBuddha was passing through a village. The people of that village were against him, against his philosophy, so they gathered around him to insult him. They used ugly words, vulgar words. Buddha listened. Ananda, Buddha’s disciple who was with him, got very angry, but he couldn’t say anything because Buddha was listening so silently, so patiently, rather as if he was enjoying the whole thing. Then even the crowd became a little frustrated because he was not getting irritated and it seemed he was enjoying.\nBuddha said, “Now, if you are finished, I should move – because I have to reach the other village soon. They must be waiting just as you were waiting for me. If you have not told me all the things that you thought to tell me, I will be coming back within a few days, then you can finish it.”\nSomebody from the crowd said, “But we have been insulting you, we have insulted you. Won’t you react? Won’t you say something?”\nBuddha said, “That is difficult. If you want reaction from me, then you are too late. You should have come at least ten years ago, because then I used to react. But I am now no longer so foolish. I see that you are angry, that’s why you are insulting me. I see your anger, the fire burning in your mind. I feel compassion for you. This is my response – I feel compassion for you. Unnecessarily you are troubled.\n“Even if I am wrong, why should you get so irritated? That is not your business. If I am wrong I am going to hell, you will not go with me. If I am wrong I will suffer for it, you will not suffer for it. But it seems you love me so much and you think about me and consider me so much that you are so angry, irritated. You have left your work in the fields and you have come just to say a few things to me. I am thankful.”\nJust when he was leaving he said, “One thing more I would like to say to you. In the other village I left behind, a great crowd just like you had come there and they had brought many sweets just as a present for me, a gift from the village. But I told them that I don’t take sweets. They took the sweets back. I ask you, what will they do with those sweets?”\nSo somebody from the crowd said, “What will they do? It is easy, there is no need to answer. They will distribute them in the village and they will enjoy.”\nSo Buddha said, “Now what will you do? You have brought only insults and I say I don’t take them. What will you do? I feel so sorry for you. You can insult me, that is up to you. But I don’t take it, that is up to me – whether I take it or not.” Buddha said, “I don’t take unnecessary things, useless things. I don’t get unnecessarily burdened. I feel compassion for you.”\nThis is response. If a person is angry and you are present there, not with your past, you will feel always compassion. Reaction becomes anger, response always is compassion. You will see through the person. It will become transparent that he is angry, he is suffering, he is in misery, he is ill.\nWhen someone is in fever you don’t start beating him and asking, “Why are you having a fever? Why is your body hot? Why have you got a temperature?” You serve the man, you help him to come out of it. And when somebody is angry he also is having a temperature, he is in a fever, he is feverish. Why get so angry about it? He is in a mental disease which is more dangerous than any bodily disease, more fatal. So if the wife is angry the husband will feel compassion, he will try in every way to help her to be out of it. This is just mad – that she is angry and you also get angry. This is just mad, insane. You will look at the person, you will feel the misery she is in or he is in, and you will help.\nBut if the past comes in then everything goes wrong. And it can happen only if you go deep in meditation, otherwise it cannot happen. Just intellectual understanding won’t help. If you go deep in meditation your wounds will be thrown, a catharsis will happen. You become more and more clear inside, clarity is attained, you become like a mirror. You don’t have any wounds really, so no one can hit them. Then you can look at the person, then you can respond.\nResponse is always good, reaction is always bad. Response is always beautiful, reaction is always ugly. Avoid reactions and allow responses. Reaction is from the past, response is here and now.\nEnough for today.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7939","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/vedanta_seven_steps_to_samadhi/part15/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/vedanta_seven_steps_to_samadhi/>Vedanta.

Abu, Rajasthan, India</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I FEEL LOST IN YOU WITHOUT REASON OR DIRECTION. QUESTIONS AND DESIRES
FALL IN CONFUSION BEFORE YOU. OVERPOWERED BY SENSELESS FAITH AND LOVE,
LISTLESSLY I WAIT, FEELING LIKE A FOOL. ARE THERE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
BLIND FAITH, LOVE AND SURRENDER?</p><p><br></p><p>There is a state when you certainly feel like a fool, but this is the
beginning of wisdom. Only fools think they are wise, and those who are
wise become wise when they start thinking that they are fools. The
moment you can feel that you are a fool wisdom has dawned upon you. Now
you will change, now there will be transformation, now the possibilities
open infinitely... because this is part of the foolish mind – not to
realize the foolishness. And this is the beginning of a wise mind – to
realize one’s ignorance, foolishness.</p><p><br></p><p>So this is good news that you realize that you are a fool, this is
something worth attaining. The ego cannot exist now. The ego always
exists with knowledgeability, one goes on feeling one knows without
knowing.</p><p><br></p><p>It is reported that the oracle of Delphi declared Socrates the wisest
man on the earth. So a few people, disciples of Socrates, came to him
and said, “Socrates, be happy. The oracle has declared that you are the
wisest man on the earth.”</p><p>Socrates laughed and said, “Go back. There must have been some
mistake. How can I be the wisest man? – because I know only one thing,
that I don’t know anything, I am ignorant. So there has been some
mistake. You go back and tell the oracle.”</p><p><br></p><p>They went back to the oracle and said, “Socrates himself has denied
it, so there must be something erroneous. He says he is not wise, he
says he realizes only one thing – that he is absolutely ignorant, he
knows nothing. He claims only this much knowledge, that he knows
nothing.”</p><p><br></p><p>The oracle said, “That’s why I have declared that he is the wisest
man, that is the reason – because only the wisest can say that he does
not know anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>Fools always claim knowledge. Only then, only there through their
claim, can they hide their stupidity. So be happy if you feel that you
are a fool and you can see your foolishness. The one who can see his
foolishness has become separate from it; now foolishness exists apart.
It is there but you are separate; you can witness it, you are not
identified with it now. Consciously alert, everybody will see that he is
a fool.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, there is no difference between blind faith, love and
surrender – because all differences belong to the intellect, all
distinctions belong to the intellect. The heart knows no distinctions.
Whether you call it blind faith or you call it surrender or you call it
love depends on your intellect. The heart doesn’t know any distinction,
the heart knows only the feelings – the feeling is the same.</p><p><br></p><p>When do you call a faith blind? When? When the intellect says that
this faith is wrong then the intellect calls it blind. When the
intellect feels that some faith is justified by reason, then the
intellect says that this faith is right. But does faith need any
justification from reason? Is reason in any way the authority to know
what is right and what is wrong in the world of feeling?</p><p><br></p><p>Always rationalists have said that the believers are blind – always.
But have you known any believer who was not blind? People who were
following Jesus were blind – everybody condemned them. Those who were
following Buddha were blind, rationalists condemned them. Rationalists
have always been saying that faith is blind. This is just a trick of
logic to say that that faith is right which is not blind – but there is
no such faith.</p><p><br></p><p>The very word faith means that where there are no grounds to believe,
you believe. If there are grounds then there is no need for faith. For
example, you don’t believe that the earth exists. Is it not a fact?
There is no need for faith. The earth exists: this is a fact, justified,
rational; faith is not needed. Faith comes only when the reason cannot
justify but the heart feels it. And reason is not the totality, reason
is not the total life and existence. There are things which go beyond
reason, which reason cannot comprehend but which the heart feels.</p><p><br></p><p>There are only two ways: either you deny the heart or you deny
reason. When reason and heart are in conflict, these are the two
alternatives: either you follow reason and say to the heart that it is
blind, and unless something is justified, proved, you are not going to
believe<span class=s4></span>But do you know,</p><p>whenever something is rationalized, proved, there is no need to
believe.</p><p><br></p><p>Marx, the founder of communism, used to say, “I will not believe in
God unless God is proved in a scientific laboratory.” But he knew it
well, so he added, “Don’t try to prove God in a scientific way,</p><p>because once you prove God in a scientific way, in a scientific
laboratory, there will be no need to believe.” Do you believe in
chemistry or physics? There is no need. Only the unproved needs faith;
the heart feels that it is there but reason cannot prove it.</p><p><br></p><p>I have loved very few sentences in my life – very few, rare, they can
be counted on one’s fingers. One of these few sentences is one from
Tertullian, one Christian mystic. He said, “I believe in God because God
is absurd, because God cannot be believed, is impossible to prove.
That’s why I believe.” ... Because if it is possible to prove there is
no need to believe, then there are facts. The heart can feel and lead
you. The reason will say heart is blind because reason thinks that only
he has eyes, but the heart has its own eyes. When you love a person,
love is always blind. Have you seen any love with eyes? A person who
goes on following reason will never be in love.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened to Immanuel Kant, one of the greatest German thinkers. He
was a complete rationalist. One woman loved Immanuel Kant and proposed
marriage to him. He said, “Wait, because first I will have to think pro
and con – whether marriage can lead to happiness or not. And unless I
decide rationally I cannot take any step.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he thought and thought and brooded and contemplated, and he wrote
at least one thousand pages for and against. And then he concluded that
both the sides seemed to be almost equal, and a decision was difficult.
So he went to find the woman to tell her that a decision was difficult
and she would have to wait a little longer, but when he went there he
found that she was already married and the mother of three children.
Immanuel Kant remained unmarried; such a man cannot be in love. And this
is the rationalist mind, one of the keenest minds – logical, logical to
the very extreme – but if you start deciding with the mind, love cannot
happen.</p><p><br></p><p>To reason, love is blind and for the heart, reason is foolish. For
the heart reason is foolish, stupid; it may be useful as far as the
market is concerned, but is not useful as far as life is concerned. So
those who live in reason live in the market and all that transcends the
market, is greater than the market, is beyond them. They never realize
it, they never have a glimpse; that rainbow never arises in their lives,
it goes beyond. They live in the mundane, the trivial. No poetry ever
happens to them, no singing ever descends in their hearts, no dance is
possible for them – ecstasy is not for them.</p><p><br></p><p>So it doesn’t matter what you call it – blind faith, love or
surrender – call it whatsoever you like. Remember only one thing: it
should arise from your feeling, and it cannot arise from your mind. And
don’t force your mind to be the leader, don’t force reason to be the
leader, because through mind you may become more powerful but you will
be less happy. Through mind you may attain much wealth but you will
remain poor within. Through mind you may rule thousands of people but
you will not be a master like Buddha or Jesus – inside you will remain a
slave.</p><p><br></p><p>This has to be chosen: if you want more power, more money, more
prestige, follow reason; if you want more happiness, more bliss, more
silence, more peace, more God, more ecstasy, then don’t listen to
reason, follow the heart. They are two different dimensions and don’t
try to confuse them. Decide well, and then follow one path. Can you be
satisfied just by reason? Can only logic make you happy? Logic is simply
dead, dry; one cannot live by logic alone. As Jesus says one cannot live
by bread alone, I say one cannot live by logic alone. But you can try,
and in that effort you will lose all that is life, all that is of worth,
and all that can be felt as a blessing and beatitude.</p><p>“Overpowered by senseless faith and love, listlessly I wait.” Nothing
else can be done but there is no need to wait listlessly – you can wait
ecstatically. This listlessness will come because reason goes on
interfering. Reason goes on saying, “What foolishness are you doing?
What are you doing here? Why are you waiting and wasting time?” That
reason creates the listlessness, otherwise waiting can become a joy. The
most joyous thing possible is waiting – hope throbbing, heart beating
for the unknown, and you wait in silence with infinite patience.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can wait with joy there will not be much need to wait for
long, if you cannot wait with joy you may have to wait for many lives –
because the divine can happen to you only when your waiting is ecstatic,
filled with joy. Just look at a woman waiting for her lover: she has
faith, she has ecstasy – the eyes and the infinite patience and the
happiness. Wait like a lover, only then is your waiting meaningful.
Don’t wait listlessly, because if you are so listless your lover may
come but will not find you worthy to be with. Only your joy can become
the invitation. Wait blissfully, ecstatically, and then I say to you
that you will not need more waiting. There will be no need, it can
happen this very moment.</p><p><br></p><p>If your joy is total this very moment there is no need to wait. The
divine will descend in you – you have fulfilled the condition. And this
I call the condition: waiting with infinite patience, but ecstatically.
This is the condition. Fulfill this and a single moment will not be
lost.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said in old Egyptian books that whenever the disciple is ready
the master appears. Whenever, wherever the disciple is ready the master
appears. There is no need for the disciple to seek the master, it is
always the master who seeks the disciple. Even if you go to the master,
it is always the master who seeks you, who finds you.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is true for the divine happening: whenever you are ready it
happens – God seeks you. He has always been seeking you. He has been
following you, he has been waiting for you. Whenever you are ready the
seed will sprout, the bud will become the flower. But getting ready
means waiting – waiting is the only prayer you can do. But if you don’t
believe you cannot wait. Only faith can wait. Reason always insists on
things happening immediately. Heart can wait, there is no urgency for
the heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Try to understand this: time exists only for reason. For the heart
there is no time, heart exists in timelessness. Only for reason is there
time. So mind goes on insisting on haste, hurry, urgency, and mind is
always tense. Time is going, flowing, life is becoming less and less
every moment. Things should happen instantly – that is the insistence of
reason. But the heart knows no time, there are no clocks for the heart.
Heart exists timelessly, that’s why the heart can wait – the heart can
wait infinitely.</p><p><br></p><p>If you love, if you have faith, if you trust, then there is no hurry,
and then there is no need to wait listlessly. Why not dance while
waiting? Why waste this time in listlessness? Why not dance? It will be
better when your lover comes if your lover finds you dancing. It will be
a good meeting, it will be the right moment.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question: Question 2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>IF EVEN FIFTY PERCENT OF ALL PERSONS SHOULD BECOME ENLIGHTENED, DOES
IT MEAN THAT FIFTY PERCENT WILL HAVE TO IMMEDIATELY BECOME IDIOTS? THE
POLAR OPPOSITE THEORY DOESN’T SEEM TO GIVE MUCH HOPE TO MORE THAN FIVE
PERCENT.</p><p><br></p><p>You misunderstood – but that is always more possible than to
understand. Your mind moves immediately to the wrong conclusion, and you
cannot help it, that’s how you have trained your mind. In all these
talks I have been telling you that enlightenment means going beyond the
polar opposites. So there is no state against enlightenment, it means
transcending the division. We have been saying again and again that mind
is enlightened only when it transcends division.</p><p><br></p><p>If fifty percent of persons are intelligent, then fifty percent will
be foolish; if five percent are geniuses, then five percent will be
idiots. But a genius is not enlightened – he is as unenlightened as the
idiot, there is no difference. He may be an Einstein, he may have won
Nobel prizes, but that doesn’t make any difference. Just by winning a
Nobel prize you don’t become enlightened. A genius is as far away from
enlightenment as an idiot. An idiot can also jump into enlightenment
just as a genius can jump into it.</p><p><br></p><p>Intelligence and stupidity are polar opposites. To enlightenment
there is no polar opposite – it is transcendence of both. So there
exists no state which is against enlightenment. Have you ever heard of
anyone who is just the polar opposite to Buddha or Jesus? There is no
one. The whole Vedanta, the whole of Upanishads’ teaching, the very
doctrine is this: that when you transcend duality you attain a totally
new dimension, nothing exists against it.</p><p><br></p><p>In Sanskrit we have three terms: dukkha which means pain, suffering,
misery; sukkha which means happiness, pleasure, joy; and ananda which
can be translated as bliss. Happiness is against misery, they are polar
opposites. Bliss is not against anything, there is no state which is
against bliss. If you are happy you will become miserable, if you are
miserable you will become happy. You can move, this duality is there.
But if you are blissful you cannot move anywhere – duality has
disappeared. Against ananda, against bliss, there exists no state.</p><p><br></p><p>Enlightenment is not against ignorance, it is against ignorance and
knowledge both. It is beyond, not against. So a person who knows more is
not enlightened, and a person who knows less is not unenlightened
because he knows less. Wherever you are you can take the jump into
enlightenment. So sometimes very uneducated people have also jumped, not
very intelligent people have also jumped. The jump is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>And sometimes it happens that a person who is not educated much is
more courageous and can take the jump more easily than a person who
knows too much. Just because he knows too much he becomes too afraid of
taking risks, because he is so clever he becomes cunning also –
cleverness creates cunningness. He becomes calculative, and on the path
of the divine you cannot calculate. Only gamblers, only those who can
jump without calculating, only those who can take risks, only they can
enter.</p><p><br></p><p>So this question is just through your misunderstanding. In the world
balance exists, but when you transcend the world you also transcend this
polar balance. You go beyond the two, you become one.</p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>DOES LAUGHTER BELONG TO EVERY STAGE?</p><p><br></p><p>This is worth considering, significant. The first thing to understand
is that, except man, no animal is capable of laughter. Laughter shows a
very high peak. If you go out on a street and you see a buffalo laughing
you will be scared to death, and if you report it nobody is going to
believe that it happened. It is impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>Why can’t animals laugh? Why can’t trees laugh? There is a very deep
causality to the laughter; only that animal can laugh which can get
bored. Animals and trees are not bored. Boredom and laughter – this is
the polar duality, these are the polar opposites. Man is the only animal
who is bored; boredom is the symbol of humanity. Look at dogs and cats –
they are never bored. Man seems to be deep in boredom. Why are they not
bored? Why does only man suffer boredom? And the higher your
intelligence the more you will be bored, a lower intelligence is not
bored so much. That’s why primitives are more happy.</p><p><br></p><p>You will find more happy people in a primitive society than in a
civilized society; even a Bertrand Russell becomes jealous. When
Bertrand Russell for the first time came in contact with some primitive
tribes he started feeling jealous because they were so happy – not bored
at all. Life was a blessing. They were poor, starved, almost naked; in
every way they had nothing, but they were not bored with life. In
Bombay, in New York, in London, everybody is bored – more intelligent,
more civilized, more boredom.</p><p><br></p><p>So the secret can be understood: the more you can think, the more you
will be bored, because through thinking you can compare – past, future,
present. Through thinking you can hope, through thinking you can ask,
“What is the meaning of it?” And the moment a person asks, “What is the
meaning of it?” boredom will enter, because really there is no meaning
in anything. If you ask the question, “What is the meaning of it?” you
will feel meaninglessness. And when meaninglessness is felt you will be
bored. Animals are not bored, trees are not bored, rocks are not bored.
They never ask, “What is the meaning of life, what is the purpose of
life?” They never ask so they never feel it is meaningless. As they are
they accept it, as life is it is accepted. There is no boredom.</p><p><br></p><p>Man feels bored, laughter is the antidote. You cannot live without
laughter, because you can kill your boredom only through laughter. You
cannot find a single joke in primitive societies, they don’t have any
jokes. Jews have the largest number of jokes, they are the most highly
bored people on the earth. But they must be so, because they win more
Nobel prizes than any other community. The whole last century almost all
the great names are Jews: Freud, Einstein, Marx – Jews. And look at the
list of Nobel prizewinners – almost half the Nobel prizes go to the
Jews. They have the largest number of jokes.</p><p><br></p><p>And this may be the reason why all over the world Jews are hated –
because everybody feels jealous of them. Wherever they are they will
always win any type of competition, so everybody feels jealous</p><p>of them, the whole world is united against them, feels hate for them.
When you cannot compete with someone hate is the result. And they have
the most beautiful jokes on the earth. Why? They must be feeling very
bored; they have to create jokes – a joke is the antidote to feeling
bored. Laughter is needed to exist, otherwise you will commit
suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>Now try to understand the mechanism of laughter, how it happens. If I
tell a joke, why do you laugh? What happens? What is the inner
mechanism? If I tell a joke, expectation is created, you start
expecting. Your mind starts searching for what the end is going to be,
and you cannot conceive the end. A joke moves in two dimensions: first
it moves in a logical dimension, you can conceive it. If the joke goes
on being logical to the very end there will be no laughter. Suddenly the
joke takes a turn and becomes illogical, something which you could not
conceive. And when the joke takes a turn and the result becomes
illogical, the expectation, the tension that was created in you,
suddenly explodes. You relax, laughter comes out of you.</p><p><br></p><p>Laughter is a relaxation, but a tension is needed. A story creates
expectation, tension. You start feeling that now the crescendo, now the
crescendo will come, something is going to happen. Your backbone is
straight like a yogi, you have no more thoughts in the mind; the whole
being is just waiting, all the energy moving towards the conclusion. And
all that you could conceive is not going to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly something happens which the mind could not conceive;
something absurd happens, something illogical, irrational. The end is
such a turn that it was impossible for logic to think about it. You
explode. The whole energy that has become a pillar inside suddenly
relaxes. Laughter comes out of you through this relaxation. Man is
bored, hence he needs laughter. The more bored he is, the more and more
laughter he will need, otherwise he cannot exist.</p><p><br></p><p>Thirdly, it has also to be understood about laughter that it is of
three types. One, when you laugh at someone. This is the meanest, the
lowliest, very ordinary and vulgar – when you laugh at somebody else’s
cost. This is violent, aggressive, insulting. Deep down there is a
revenge.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, when you laugh at yourself. This is worth achieving, this
is cultured, and the man who can laugh at himself is valuable. He has
risen above vulgarity, he has risen above low instincts – hatred,
aggression, violence.</p><p><br></p><p>And thirdly, the highest laughter, which is not about anybody –
neither the other nor oneself. The third is just cosmic, you laugh at
the whole situation as it is. The whole situation as it is, is absurd –
no purpose in the future, no beginning in the beginning. The whole
situation of existence is such that if you can see the whole – such a
great vastness, an infinite vastness, moving to no fixed purpose, moving
to no goal; so much going on without leading anywhere; nobody in the
past to create it, nobody in the end to finish it; a whole cosmos, and
moving so beautifully, so systematically, so rationally – if you can see
this whole cosmos, then a laughter arises.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about three monks. No name is mentioned, because they
never told their names to anybody, they never answered anything. So in
China they are only known simply as “the three laughing monks.”</p><p><br></p><p>They did only one thing: they would enter a village, stand in the
marketplace, and start laughing. Suddenly people would become aware and
they would laugh with their whole being. Then others</p><p>would also get the infection, and then a crowd would gather, and just
looking at them the whole crowd would start laughing. What is happening?
Then the whole town would get involved, and they would move to another
town. They were loved very much. That was their only sermon, the only
message – that laugh. And they would not teach, they would simply create
the situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Then it happened they became famous all over the country – the three
laughing monks. The whole of China loved them, respected them. Nobody
had preached that way – that life must be just a laughter and nothing
else. And they were not laughing at anybody in particular, but simply
laughing as if they had understood the cosmic joke. They spread so much
joy all over China without using a single word. People would ask their
names but they would simply laugh, so that became their name, the three
laughing monks.</p><p><br></p><p>Then they became old, and in one village one of the three monks died.
The whole village was very expectant, filled with expectations, because
now at least when one of them had died they must weep. This would be
something worth seeing, because no one could even conceive of these
people weeping.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole village gathered. The two monks were standing by the side
of the corpse of the third and laughing such a belly laugh. So the
villagers asked, “At least explain this!”</p><p><br></p><p>So for the first time they spoke, and they said, “We are laughing
because this man has won. We were always wondering who would die first,
and this man has defeated us. We are laughing at our defeat, at his
victory. He lived with us for many years, and we laughed together and we
enjoyed each other’s togetherness, presence. There can be no other way
of giving him the last send-off, we can only laugh.”</p><p><br></p><p>The whole village was sad, but when the dead monk’s body was put on
the funeral pyre, then the village realized that not only were these two
joking – the third who was dead was also laughing... because the third
man who was dead had told his companions, “Don’t change my dress!” It
was conventional that when a man died they changed the dress and gave a
bath to the body, so he had said, “Don’t give me a bath because I have
never been unclean. So much laughter has been in my life that no
impurity can accumulate near me, can even come to me. I have not
gathered any dust, laughter is always young and fresh. So don’t give me
a bath and don’t change my clothes.”</p><p><br></p><p>So just to pay him respect they had not changed his clothes. And when
the body was put on the fire, suddenly they became aware that he had
hidden many things under his clothes and those things started... Chinese
fireworks! So the whole village laughed, and those two said, “You
rascal! You have died, but again you have defeated us. Your laughter is
the last.”</p><p><br></p><p>There is a cosmic laughter when the whole joke of this cosmos is
understood. That is the highest, only a buddha can laugh like that.
These three monks must have been three buddhas. But if you can laugh the
second, that too is worth trying. Avoid the first – don’t laugh at
anyone’s cost, that is ugly and violent. If you want to laugh, laugh at
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why Mulla Nasruddin in every one of his jokes and stories
always proves himself the stupid man in it, never anybody else. He
always laughs at himself and allows you to laugh at him. He never puts
anybody else in the situation of being foolish. Sufis say that Mulla
Nasruddin is the wise fool. Learn at least that much – the second
laughter.</p><p>If you can learn the second, the third will not be far ahead, soon
you will reach the third. Leave the first laughter, that is degrading.
But almost ninety-nine percent of the time you laugh the first one. Much
courage is needed to laugh at oneself, much confidence is needed to
laugh at oneself. For the spiritual seeker, even laughter should become
a part of sadhana. Remember not to laugh the first laughter, remember to
laugh the second – and remember to reach the third.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>CAN THERE BE MOMENTS OF EFFORTLESSNESS WHILE A SEEKER IS ENGAGED IN
THE FIRST THREE STAGES? IS EFFORT COMPLETELY LACKING IN THE SECOND FOUR
STAGES? DOES THERE COME A POINT AT WHICH BOTH EFFORT AND EFFORTLESSNESS
MUST CEASE?</p><p><br></p><p>First, there can be moments of effortlessness even while making
effort. If you are total in your effort there will be glimpses of
effortlessness. Suddenly effort will have disappeared for a moment,
there will be a gap. If you are aware and look deep in the gap you will
see. Just doing meditation here, I feel many of you achieve for a single
moment effortlessness. You may not be aware, but try to be aware. While
doing, a moment comes when you feel you are not doing it – as if it is
happening.</p><p><br></p><p>You may have started it as a doing. When you start taking deep, fast
chaotic breaths, of course, it is a fact that you start it. But have you
observed that sometimes the breathing takes you, the mastery has
changed? Now the breathing is going by itself, it has taken over. When
you start the second stage, in the beginning there is effort to allow
madness; even sometimes to imitate, to force, to do something because
everybody else is doing. But you can watch: a moment comes to many, to
at least ninety percent of people here, when the madness has taken over.
You are not doing it, rather it is doing you. You are not the doer, it
is moving by itself – then it is effortless. And when it is moving by
itself it is beautiful, only then is the catharsis happening. When you
are doing it is not catharsis, you are only starting it. When the
madness has taken over and is on its own and the movement is going
automatically, then it is catharsis – now the repressed energies are
working. You may have started laughter in catharsis. Then a point comes
when you feel that laughter is going by itself. You can watch it, it
will continue. No need to do it, it is happening.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes fear grips at that moment, because then you feel you have
gone insane. Up to that moment you are making effort, you are the master
and you are not afraid. You know that you can stop it, you know that it
is within your control, you are doing it. Fear enters whenever you feel
that it has become automatic. You get scared, because now you see it may
not stop, it may continue. Then what are you going to do? And if you
become afraid you again start doing. And that’s why you cannot watch
effortless moments.</p><p><br></p><p>There is one day left (OF THE MEDITATION CAMP); watch and don’t get
afraid, because that is the right moment – when the catharsis is
starting to happen, when you become scared. When things are coming out,
immediately you close yourself and make all efforts again to do
something. With the doing the mind is at ease; with the happening the
mind is afraid, and effortlessness will mean</p><p>happening. But don’t be afraid, because any happening can be stopped
– if you have started it, it can be stopped. So don’t get afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why my insistence that when I say “Stop!” stop completely –
because if you cannot stop when I say stop it can be dangerous. I don’t
want you to become mad, rather I want you to become saner through
throwing madness out. You must remain in control. But don’t try, there
is no need. If you have started it, this is the law: if you have
started, you are deep inside in control. Don’t get scared, allow it to
happen. Any moment it can be stopped.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why after the third stage I always insist that when I say
stop, when you hear the word stop, you stop, because that will make you
the master and you will remain the master. Even while catharsis is
happening you know that at any time you can push the button off. Once
you become aware that the button can be put on and off you will never be
afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>Madness is there within everyone and the more you hide it the more
you are vulnerable, the more you can go mad any moment. And if you go
mad then you will not be the master. If you never started it then you
cannot stop it. You can only stop that which you have started. If you
have not started it you cannot stop it.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t go on suppressing, because a quantity can be tolerated but
there comes a moment when the quantity reaches the climax, the
evaporating point – one hundred degrees. Then you start boiling and
evaporating. Many persons who were just like you a day before are in
madhouses now. You can be there any day. If you don’t allow catharsis
you are all prone to go mad, because civilization is such, the situation
is such, that everybody accumulates madness. You have to throw it every
day to remain clean and pure, to retain the clarity of mind and
vision.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you know the law that if you start a thing you can stop it,
then you can start anything and you can stop. Be the master in the
starting, you will be the master in the end also. But if a thing starts
by itself then you cannot stop it, then you don’t know where the button
is to turn on and off.</p><p><br></p><p>And secondly, “Is effort completely lacking in the second four
stages?”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. In the first three effort is there, in the last four there is no
effort. And if you make effort you will not grow in them. As without
effort you will not grow in the first three, with effort you will not
grow in the last four. Effort is helpful in the first three, effort is a
hindrance in the last four. So one has to learn effort and then one has
to learn to drop effort, because there are things for which effort
cannot be made.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, you sow some seeds, some flower seeds; effort is needed
because the seeds are to be sown. You choose the soil, you give water,
sunrays, fertilizers; you arrange everything, you do everything. Effort
is needed. But then the seeds sprout, you need not pull them to make
them grow faster. You need not pull them, if you pull them they will
die. Effort is not needed.</p><p><br></p><p>And when buds come to your plant, don’t try to open them and make
them flower. You will kill the whole thing. And if you open unripe buds
those flowers will be ugly, there will be no fragrance and they will
look artificial. You can do everything to help the plant but you need
not make any positive effort to open the flowers. They will open by
themselves. And when they open by themselves they</p><p>will be ripe, they will be ready to express themselves. Their
fragrance, their beauty, their ecstasy will come out.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is the case in spiritual discipline. The first three stages
are just to make the ground ready – seeds sown, every condition prepared
– and the four end ones are just the flowering stages, they come by
themselves. Don’t interfere with them by your effort, and don’t do
anything positively. You simply wait and you will see that your inner
consciousness is growing every moment.</p><p><br></p><p>And thirdly, “Does there come a point at which both effort and
effortlessness must cease?”</p><p><br></p><p>Yes. Effort is positive, effortlessness is negative. The first three
stages are effort, the second three stages are effortless, and the
seventh, the last, is neither. It is neither effort nor effortless, it
is neither positive nor negative – it is the transcendence. The seventh
is the transcendence. We will try to understand that tomorrow morning.
The seventh is the transcendence. Nothing is needed – neither effort nor
awareness not to make effort. Both have to be dropped.</p><p><br></p><p>The last question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHAT IS MOMENT-TO-MOMENT UNDERSTANDING IN RELATIONSHIP?</p><p><br></p><p>A difficult question – because unless you learn to live moment to
moment you cannot understand it. As we live, we live out of the past. If
someone insults you, you immediately react. That reaction comes from
your past experiences. It is not from you, it is from the chain of your
experiences.</p><p><br></p><p>If someone is loving towards you, you become loving – that loving may
be from the past experiences. So living moment to moment and
understanding moment to moment in relationship comes only if you become
aware of the past chain and don’t allow it to function. And always
respond in the present, not through the past.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, someone insults you. Many people have insulted you in
the past; there has come a wound in your heart, through all the insults
a wound is created. This insult will also hit the wound, and then you
will react. That reaction will not be justified because this man is not
creating the wound. And if the wound is touched, the pain is not created
by his insult really. It has been created by many insults and the
reaction is accumulated; it is not justified.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why it happens that if you react the other always feels, “Why
are you reacting so much? I have not said anything.” You also know it:
you are not aware that you have said something to someone which has
become a hurt in him and he reacts. And you say, “You have misunderstood
me, because I have not said anything to insult you. Why are you
reacting? Are you mad?” But you don’t know. He has a wound, and when you
hit the wound the whole pain comes towards you. The wound may have been
created by many people – unknown, known, not remembered – but the whole
wound is poured on this person. This is not justified.</p><p>So what will it be to respond immediately? It will be first to put
aside the past. Look at this man with alertness so that the past doesn’t
cloud you. Look at whatsoever he has said, dissect it, analyze it, in
the light of the present. And it will be better if you can wait a little
and meditate on it.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened once, one woman wrote a letter to an American author,
Dale Carnegie. Dale Carnegie had delivered a lecture on the radio on
Abraham Lincoln, and he had mentioned many wrong dates in it. The woman
was a lover of Abraham Lincoln, so she wrote a very angry letter saying,
“If you don’t know the abc of Abraham Lincoln’s life you should not go
on the radio. And this is insulting. If you are not well informed, then
first get informed and then start lecturing.”</p><p><br></p><p>Dale Carnegie was a man of fame, had written many bestsellers; he got
offended, he was very angry. So he wrote a letter immediately in the
same tone, the same anger, the same irritation. But it was late and the
servant had gone, so he left the letter on the table. In the morning he
would post it.</p><p><br></p><p>In the morning, when he was putting it in the envelope, he just
looked once more at it. He felt, “This is too much. The woman has not
written like this, she doesn’t deserve so much anger from me.” And in a
way he felt she was right also. So he tore up the letter and wrote
another which was totally different. There was no anger, no irritation
in it, rather the attitude of thanking her for making him aware of some
mistakes and he felt obliged. But then he thought, “If in twelve hours
so much can change, there is no hurry. I can wait for a few more
days.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he tried one experiment. He left the letter again on the table. By
the evening he again read it and he wanted to change a few words again.
For seven days he continued, and on the seventh day it became a love
letter. And Dale Carnegie relates that that woman proved one of the best
friends that he had ever had in his life. What would have happened if
the servant had not gone and the letter had been posted? He would have
created an enemy.</p><p><br></p><p>When Gurdjieff’s father was dying he told Gurdjieff, “Only one
message I give to you – and remember it!” Gurdjieff was very small, just
nine years of age, and the father said, “I am not rich so I have nothing
to give to you, only one advice which my father gave to me when he was
dying. And this is the message: that if you get angry, don’t answer
immediately, wait twenty-four hours. Then do whatsoever you like. Even
if you want to kill the man, go and kill – but after twenty-four
hours.”</p><p><br></p><p>And Gurdjieff says, “In my whole life anger has not created any
problem for me, because I have to wait twenty-four hours and then the
whole thing seems foolish. And sometimes even the person who created
anger seems to be right, so I go and thank him. Through anger I have not
created a single enemy, and through anger there has been no complexity
in my life.”</p><p><br></p><p>So alertness is needed in moment-to-moment relationship. Alertness is
needed. Be alert! Don’t allow your past to come in between you and the
person to whom you are relating. It will take time to become aware
because the past is so swift, it enters so immediately, there is no time
gap. Somebody says something and the past has entered, you have
interpreted through the past. So move a little slowly. Look at the
person, wait, absorb whatsoever has happened to you, meditate, and then
respond in the present. Once you become efficient, once you know this
key, you have one of the keys which can allow you to enter into the
mystery, into the mysteries of other persons.</p><p><br></p><p>Every person is carrying such a mysterious being but the being is
closed to you. Every person can become the door for the divine, any
ordinary person is extraordinary. Just behind the surface</p><p>the mysterious is hidden, but you need a key to open it. And that key
is moment-to-moment alert response. Not reaction – response. Reaction is
always dead; you do something because he has done something. Response is
totally different.</p><p><br></p><p>I will tell you one anecdote.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha was passing through a village. The people of that village were
against him, against his philosophy, so they gathered around him to
insult him. They used ugly words, vulgar words. Buddha listened. Ananda,
Buddha’s disciple who was with him, got very angry, but he couldn’t say
anything because Buddha was listening so silently, so patiently, rather
as if he was enjoying the whole thing. Then even the crowd became a
little frustrated because he was not getting irritated and it seemed he
was enjoying.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “Now, if you are finished, I should move – because I
have to reach the other village soon. They must be waiting just as you
were waiting for me. If you have not told me all the things that you
thought to tell me, I will be coming back within a few days, then you
can finish it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody from the crowd said, “But we have been insulting you, we
have insulted you. Won’t you react? Won’t you say something?”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “That is difficult. If you want reaction from me, then
you are too late. You should have come at least ten years ago, because
then I used to react. But I am now no longer so foolish. I see that you
are angry, that’s why you are insulting me. I see your anger, the fire
burning in your mind. I feel compassion for you. This is my response – I
feel compassion for you. Unnecessarily you are troubled.</p><p><br></p><p>“Even if I am wrong, why should you get so irritated? That is not
your business. If I am wrong I am going to hell, you will not go with
me. If I am wrong I will suffer for it, you will not suffer for it. But
it seems you love me so much and you think about me and consider me so
much that you are so angry, irritated. You have left your work in the
fields and you have come just to say a few things to me. I am
thankful.”</p><p><br></p><p>Just when he was leaving he said, “One thing more I would like to say
to you. In the other village I left behind, a great crowd just like you
had come there and they had brought many sweets just as a present for
me, a gift from the village. But I told them that I don’t take sweets.
They took the sweets back. I ask you, what will they do with those
sweets?”</p><p><br></p><p>So somebody from the crowd said, “What will they do? It is easy,
there is no need to answer. They will distribute them in the village and
they will enjoy.”</p><p><br></p><p>So Buddha said, “Now what will you do? You have brought only insults
and I say I don’t take them. What will you do? I feel so sorry for you.
You can insult me, that is up to you. But I don’t take it, that is up to
me – whether I take it or not.” Buddha said, “I don’t take unnecessary
things, useless things. I don’t get unnecessarily burdened. I feel
compassion for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is response. If a person is angry and you are present there, not
with your past, you will feel always compassion. Reaction becomes anger,
response always is compassion. You will see through the person. It will
become transparent that he is angry, he is suffering, he is in misery,
he is ill.</p><p>When someone is in fever you don’t start beating him and asking, “Why
are you having a fever? Why is your body hot? Why have you got a
temperature?” You serve the man, you help him to come out of it. And
when somebody is angry he also is having a temperature, he is in a
fever, he is feverish. Why get so angry about it? He is in a mental
disease which is more dangerous than any bodily disease, more fatal. So
if the wife is angry the husband will feel compassion, he will try in
every way to help her to be out of it. This is just mad – that she is
angry and you also get angry. This is just mad, insane. You will look at
the person, you will feel the misery she is in or he is in, and you will
help.</p><p><br></p><p>But if the past comes in then everything goes wrong. And it can
happen only if you go deep in meditation, otherwise it cannot happen.
Just intellectual understanding won’t help. If you go deep in meditation
your wounds will be thrown, a catharsis will happen. You become more and
more clear inside, clarity is attained, you become like a mirror. You
don’t have any wounds really, so no one can hit them. Then you can look
at the person, then you can respond.</p><p><br></p><p>Response is always good, reaction is always bad. Response is always
beautiful, reaction is always ugly. Avoid reactions and allow responses.
Reaction is from the past, response is here and now.</p><p><br></p><p>Enough for today.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part14>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

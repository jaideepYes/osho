Abu, Rajasthan, India\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nIS VAIRAGYA, NONATTACHMENT, A METHOD, A MEANS, AN INTERMEDIATE STAGE, OR AN END IN ITSELF?\nIt is all – because means and ends are not two things. The way and the goal are not two things. The way is just the beginning of the goal, and the goal is just the ending of the way. So please, don’t divide, and don’t think in terms of the means being different from the end. Means are the end. Once you can conceive of this, the quality of your effort will change immediately.\nOrdinarily mind is always concerned with the end; means are used, exploited, to reach the end. If you could avoid the means you would like to avoid them; if you could achieve the end directly without any means, if you could reach the goal without the way, without the path, you would like to do so. You would like to reach the goal immediately. The mind divides ends and means; end is meaningful, means are just necessary, they have to be suffered.\nThis is how the ordinary mind functions, and because of this whatsoever you do becomes a suffering – because you have to pass through the path, you have to use means, methods, and therein is all suffering. Happiness is in the goal, somewhere in the future, not here and now. Here and now will be means and the end will be somewhere else, somewhere in the future, tomorrow – so today will always be a suffering.\nAnd remember, if your today is a suffering your tomorrow cannot be a happiness, because it is born of today, it comes out of this moment. The future comes out of the present, so whatsoever the present the same will remain in the future. If you are suffering now you will suffer then also. If you are suffering here you will find the hell there also – because who will find that heaven which you think is there? You? Your whole attitude creates the suffering.\nSo those who are on the spiritual path must be aware of this tendency of the mind. Forget the end and look at the means as if they are the end, and enjoy them as if they are the goal. Then the very path becomes blissful, the very journey itself becomes blissful. Every step becomes blissful, because you are not waiting for the bliss, for the next step. And out of this blissful step the next is going to be born – it will be more blissful. The tomorrow will be more blissful if today is blissful, and the bliss will grow.\nWe are doing meditations. These meditations are means, but they are goals also; so don’t try to exploit them, otherwise you will be in a hurry, you will constantly think of how to be finished with them and reach the goal. Then you will never be able to be finished with them and the goal will always remain illusory, always like the horizon, always distant. And the more you move ahead, the goal will also move ahead in the same proportion.\nEnds and means are not two things. Don’t divide. The end is just the flowering of the means, the end is just the realization of the means. The end is hidden in the means, just like the tree is hidden in the seed. The seed is the tree. Don’t look at the seed as if the seed has some secondary importance and the tree is meaningful and significant, and you can avoid the seed. If you avoid the seed the tree will never be there. Take care of the seed, love the seed, give soil to it, prepare the ground, and help the seed to grow. It will become the tree. It is already the tree unmanifest.\nSo let me say it in this way: means are the unmanifest end, and end is the manifest means. Means are seeds, and ends will be the trees, the flowering – so love the means as the end.\nVairagya is all, nonattachment is all. It is the beginning, it is the middle, it is the end. It is a method, it is an intermediate stage, it is the goal. Desirelessness is the end – but the end must be there in the beginning, only then can it grow. So desirelessness is both the first step and the last also. Of course the quality will differ. In the first step the desirelessness will be with effort, in the intermediate stage desirelessness will have become unconscious effort. In the beginning it will be conscious effort, you will have to do it; in the middle it will start happening, it will have become unconscious effort. Effort will be there, but indirect, unconscious. In the end it will be spontaneous, effort will have completely disappeared. But desirelessness is the same. Desirelessness in the beginning is with conscious effort, in the middle is with unconscious effort, in the end is effortless.\nAvoid this tendency to divide, to cut things, and see that every phenomenon is a continuity, everything is joined together. Even those things which look opposite are also joined together, they are also polarities. Develop this way of looking at things – that will be very helpful. For those who are really sincerely interested in traveling this inner path, this approach of nondividing is a must.\nThe second question: Question 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nARE THERE REALLY DISCRETE STAGES ON THE WAY TO THE ULTIMATE HAPPENING, AS THIS UPANISHAD SEEMS TO SUGGEST, OR DOES THIS HAPPENING OCCUR SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY? IS IT A MATTER OF LONG CONSCIOUS EFFORT, OR OF A SUDDEN TOTAL SURRENDER TO EXISTENCE?\nIt is both. You have to make all effort that is possible, that you can do. No stone should be left unturned, no energies should be left unused. You must get totally involved. You are required to work as a unit, only then the flowering, the happening, will become possible. But that doesn’t mean that it is an outcome of your effort; just by your effort it is not going to happen. This is a little delicate and you will have to be very penetrating about it, then only will you understand.\nLook at it in this way. You see a person walking on the street. Suddenly you have a feeling that you remember the face or you feel that you even know the name, and you say it is just on the tip of your tongue, but it is not coming. The more effort you make the more frustrated you feel – it is not coming. But you cannot leave it at that, because you have the feeling that you know this face, you know the name. And there is even this feeling that somewhere, just in the corner of the mind, the name is waiting, you have only to recall it.\nYou make all effort, you try in every way. You close your eyes, you contemplate, you ponder over it, you try to associate, you go into the past, you start feeling for some key, some clue, but nothing happens. You get frustrated, bored; you leave the whole effort, and you go into the garden and start working, or you start smoking, or you take a cup of tea. Suddenly the name is there, suddenly the memory has come, suddenly you have recognized.\nNow two things are happening. One: you are making every effort possible, but it is not coming through the effort. Then you leave all the effort, and then it comes. Effort is needed but is not enough. If you don’t make any effort it will not come when you go to the garden or when you take a cup of tea. If you have not made total effort it is not going to come. And if you make just the effort – total even – then too it is not going to come. So total effort is needed, then total relaxation also – then it will bubble up.\nMany Nobel prizes have been given for certain discoveries which happened in this way. One Nobel prize winner was working on the inner structure of the human cell, the lymph cell. He was working for years, contemplating, brooding, making many experiments, and nothing was happening, every effort was a failure. After many years of research, effort, failure, one night suddenly he had a dream, and in the dream he saw the structure, the very structure he was looking for, the structure of the human cell, just as if a magnified picture was there. He got up. Immediately he drew the drawing and then he worked on it, and it proved that the dream was true.\nBut remember, you are not going to have this dream, it cannot happen to you. It happened after so many years of effort. The conscious was exhausted. The conscious did everything that could be done and then the conscious was tired, the conscious mind was finished, the conscious accepted the failure. When the conscious is exhausted the unconscious comes into focus and starts working – but it comes only when the conscious is exhausted. If the conscious is still hoping, if the conscious is still trying, then the unconscious will not function. And this is one of the basic laws of the human psyche: that if you want the unconscious to function, exhaust the conscious completely.\nEffort will not lead you to enlightenment, but without effort no one has ever achieved it. This may look like a paradox. It is not, it is a simple law.\nBuddha tried for six years continuously, and no man has tried as totally as Buddha did. He made every effort possible, he went to every master available. There was not a single master Buddha did not go to. He surrendered to every master, and whatsoever was said he did so perfectly that even the master started feeling jealous. And every master finally had to say to Buddha, “This is all I can teach. And if nothing is happening I cannot blame you, because you are doing everything so perfectly. I am helpless. You will have to move to some other teacher.”\nThis rarely happens because disciples never do everything so perfectly, so the master can always say, “Because you are not doing well, that’s why nothing is happening.” But Buddha was doing so well, so absolutely well, that no master could say to him, “You are not doing well.” So they had to accept defeat. They had to say, “This is all we can teach, and you have done it and nothing is happening, so it is better you move to some other master. You don’t belong to me.”\nBuddha moved for six years, and he followed even absurd techniques when they were taught to him. Somebody said “Fast,” so for months he fasted. For six months he was continuously fasting, just taking a very small quantity of food every fifteen days, only twice a month. He became so weak that he was simply a skeleton. All flesh disappeared, he looked like a dead man. He became so weak that he couldn’t even walk. He finally became so weak that he would close his eyes to meditate and he would fall down in a fit.\nOne day he was taking a bath in the river Niranjana, just near Bodhgaya, and he was so weak that he couldn’t cross the river. He fell down in the river and he thought that he was going to be drowned; it was the last moment, death had come. He was so weak he couldn’t swim. Then suddenly he caught hold of a branch of a tree and remained there. And there for the first time the thought came to his mind, “If I have become so weak that I cannot cross this ordinary small river in summertime when the water has gone completely, when there is no more water and it is very small, just a little stream – if I cannot cross this little stream, how can I cross this big ocean of the world, bhavasagar? How can I transcend this world? It seems impossible. I am doing something stupid. What to do?”\nHe came out of the river in the evening and sat under a tree, which became the bodhi tree, and that evening when the moon was coming up – it was a fullmoon night – he realized that every effort is useless. He realized that nothing can be achieved, the very idea of achievement is nonsense. He had done everything. He was finished with the world, with the world of desires. He was a king and he had known every desire, he had lived every desire. He was finished with them, there was nothing to be achieved, there was nothing worthwhile. And then for six years he had been trying all austerities, all efforts, all meditations, yoga, everything, and nothing was happening. So he said, “Now there is nothing more except to die. There is nothing to be achieved, and every concept of achievement is nonsense; human desire is but futile.”\nSo he dropped all effort that evening. He sat under the tree, relaxed, with no effort, no goal, nowhere to go, nothing to be achieved, nothing worth achieving. When you are in such a state of mind, mind relaxes – no future, no desire, no goal, nowhere to go, so what to do? He simply sat, he became just like the tree. The whole night he slept, and later on Buddha said that for the first time he really slept that night – because when effort is there it continues in sleep also.\nA person who is earning money and who is after money goes on counting even in his dreams, a person who is after power and prestige and politics goes on fighting elections in his dreams. You all know that when you are sitting for an examination in the university or college, in sleep also you go on doing the examination; again and again you are in the examination hall answering questions. So whatsoever effort is there it continues in sleep – and there is always some effort for something or other.\nThat night there was no effort. Buddha said, “I slept for the first time in millions of lives. That was the first night that I slept.” Such a sleep becomes samadhi. And in the morning when he awoke he saw the last star disappear. He looked. His eyes for the first time must have been mirrorlike, with no content, just vacant, empty, nothing to project. The last star was disappearing, and Buddha said, “With that disappearing star I also disappeared. The star was disappearing and I also disappeared” – because the ego can exist only with effort. If you make some effort ego is fed – you are doing something, you are reaching somewhere, you are achieving something. When there is no effort how can you exist?\nThe last star disappeared, “And,” Buddha said, “I also disappeared. And then I looked, the sky was vacant; then I looked within, there was nothing – anatta, no self, there was no one.”\nIt is said Buddha laughed at the whole absurdity. There was no one who could reach. There was no one who could reach the goal, there was no one who could achieve liberation – there was no one at all, no entity. Space was without, space was within. “And,” he said, “at that moment of total effortlessness I achieved, I realized.” But don’t go to relax under a tree, and don’t wait for the last star to disappear. And don’t wait thinking that with the last star disappearing you will disappear. Those six years must precede. So this is the problem: without effort no one has ever achieved, with only effort no one has ever achieved. With effort coming to a point where it becomes effortlessness, realization has always been possible.\nThis is what I go on emphasizing for you to do: make as much effort as you can, and don’t withhold any energy. Bring your total energy into it so you get exhausted, so the conscious mind cannot make any more effort. When the conscious cannot do anything, suddenly the unconscious reveals. And it reveals only when the conscious has become a total failure, only then it is needed – otherwise it goes on sleeping inside.\nIt is just like this. Every human body has three layers of energies. The first layer is only for day-to-day work: eating, sleeping, walking to the office, working in the office, coming home, fighting, making love, anger – routine. The first layer. It has not got very much energy, just routine energy.\nThe second layer is for emergency situations. Unless the first is exhausted the second is not available. You are tired. You have come from the office, the boss has been very insulting. You come home and the wife is very bad-tempered, the children are creating noise, and the whole house is a mess. You feel tired and dead, and suddenly you find that the house has caught fire, it is on fire. Tiredness disappears immediately. You need not do anything, you don’t even have to take a cup of coffee. Tiredness is no more. The house is on fire, and you have got so much energy that you can work the whole night. From where is this energy coming? The first layer is exhausted, and an emergency is there – the second layer becomes available.\nAnd there is a third layer which is the real source, the source of all energy. You may call it the infinite source, the elan vital. When the second layer is also exhausted, only then the third becomes available. And when the third is available you are totally different: you have become divine, because now the source is infinite, you cannot exhaust it.\nWe live on the first layer and only sometimes in emergencies, accidents, in some dangerous situations where life is at stake, does the second become available. The third remains almost unavailable. All the effort in spiritual sadhana, discipline, is to exhaust the first. Then austerities, arduous efforts, are to exhaust the second. When the second is exhausted you fall into the ocean, and it can never be exhausted. And from that source, the original source – you may call it God, or whatsoever you like – from that original source, once a contact is made, you are totally different. This is what liberation means, this is what becoming infinite means, this is what Jesus used to call the kingdom of God.\nBut remember, you cannot just slip into it, it is not available. You have to exhaust the first layer and the second layer, only then it becomes available. Effort is needed to exhaust these layers, and then effortlessness is needed to enter the original source.\nSo the first thing to be understood: effort is needed, but effort alone is not enough – effort and then effortlessness, effort plus effortlessness. Effort precedes, and then effortlessness follows. Effortlessness is the peak of effort, it comes only when you have reached the peak. And this is so difficult to conceive that there are many misunderstandings.\nIn Japan, Zen, which is an offshoot of the Indian dhyana, says no effort is needed. And it is right. Because of this Zen has become very influential in the West. And the West has created its own Zen writers – they are Zen writers, not Zen masters. And it has much appeal; no effort is needed, you can become enlightened without any effort. So in the West there are many Zen writers, Zen painters, Zen haiku poets – and they are all bogus, because they have taken this idea.\nThis idea is very appealing, that there is no need of any effort. If there is no need of any effort, then as you are you are a master, you are enlightened, you have become a siddha. But then look at the Zen monasteries in Japan. If you read Zen scriptures, there it is written that there is no need of effort. But then go to the Zen monastery and look: for twenty years, thirty years, a seeker has to make all the efforts. Then the moment comes when that scripture becomes applicable – then, no effort.\nEffort will lead you to no effort, and this is a basic law. You can understand if you try to observe your own life. For example, if in the day you have been working hard, sleep will be deep in the night. If you have been working hard, exerting hard, then sleep will be good. If you have slept well in the night, then in the morning you will be capable of doing much hard work again. Hard work is against relaxation, it is the opposite. This would be more logical – that you sleep the whole day, rest, and then in the night you fall into deeper sleep because you have been practicing sleep the whole day. This should be the logic – that a man who has been practicing sleep the whole day must sleep better in the night than others who have not been practicing so much.\nMulla Nasruddin once went to his doctor. He had a cold and had been coughing for many days. As he was entering his doctor’s office he coughed. The doctor heard and said, “Nasruddin, it sounds better.”\nNasruddin said, “Of course it must because I have been practicing for three months.”\nBut logic is not life. If you sleep and rest the whole day you will not be able to rest at all in the night. That’s what is happening with rich people in affluent societies. Insomnia is a luxury, not everybody can afford it. To attain insomnia you have to rest for the whole day. If you can afford that much rest, only then is insomnia possible. A poor man cannot afford it. He has to fall in deep sleep, he is helpless. He has been working hard the whole day.\nBut work is against rest, so it is not logical – but this is the logic of life. Life depends on opposites, life depends on opposite polarities. Logic is linear, life is polar. Logic moves in a line, life moves in a circle. So a person who has been relaxing will not be able to relax in the night, a person who has been working hard the whole day will be able to relax.\nOr look at it from another angle. A person who is always loving, never angry, really cannot be loving. Ordinary logic will say that a person can be loving in the morning, loving in the noon, loving in the evening, loving in the night; always loving in summer, always loving in winter – every season, every moment loving. This love is not humanly possible, because the opposite is needed. He must sometimes become angry. That anger relaxes, that anger becomes the valley and then peaks of love can arise again.\nIf you want only peaks and no valleys, you are mad. Only peaks cannot exist. With every peak at least two valleys will be needed, and only between two valleys is one peak possible. So a person who is always loving is possible only in two ways. One is that he is not human. That means he must be a buddha, who can be always loving. But then his love cannot have any intensity, his love will be very silent. His love will not be like a peak, it will be just plain straight ground.\nThat’s why a buddha’s love can only be called compassion, it cannot be called love. There is no passion in it, it is compassion. There can be no intensity in it, because intensity comes from the opposite. A buddha is never angry, so from where can the intensity come?\nIn ordinary life you have to be angry, then you regain love. In marriage there is no need for the final divorce if every day you can divorce a little. In the morning divorce, in the evening remarriage, then things move beautifully. And if you go on postponing this everyday divorce then finally you will have to break, then separation is a must. Life is polarity, and this applies to everything. Effort plus effortlessness – they are the polar opposites. The ultimate is reached through effort and effortlessness, so don’t cling to one – remember both.\nBoth the parties exist; there are a few persons who go on clinging to the method, effort, and then they go on making effort. Even if nirvana has been reached they cannot be stopped. They will go on breathing, they will say, “We cannot stop. Effort is needed.” So even if God is standing before them they will go on doing chaotic breathing; they will not look, they will not look and see what has happened. They are too much attached to the method and the effort.\nAnd then there is the other polar opposite party. They say, “If no effort is needed then why breathe at all?” So they are sitting just waiting for the last star to disappear so that they can become buddhas. Both are wrong. You have to breathe and you have to stop also. You have to make all efforts and then relax also. If these are both possible, only then will you create the rhythm through which every growth becomes possible.\nThe second thing: “Are there really discrete stages on the way to the ultimate happening, as this Upanishad seems to suggest?”\nThere are no stages. Life cannot be divided. But without division there is no possibility for you to understand. I call this part of my body my hand; this part of my body my head – but can they be divided? Where my head begins and where it ends – can you draw the line? Nowhere can the line be drawn. Where my legs end, where my hand ends – can you draw a line? No line can be drawn, because inside I am one – my hands, my legs, my head, they are one. But we have to divide to understand. Division is just to help understanding, it is not actual fact.\nSo this Upanishad is dividing, not because divisions are there, but because you will not be able to understand the whole. The whole will be too much, too complex. The whole will be incomprehensible, and understanding will not be possible. That’s why the division into seven stages, and that’s why there are so many divisions. You can divide in fourteen, you can divide in seventeen – you can divide into as many as you like. And theologicians go on fighting about these divisions. They are workable, utilitarian – not existential.\nJust feel your body, close your eyes and feel. Where are the divisions? It is one. But if your eyes are not functioning well you will go to the eye specialist. And you know that eyes are not separate, they are one with the body, so then why go to the eye specialist? You can go to any doctor. The eye specialist has tried to understand eyes... because eyes in themselves are such a big, such a complex phenomenon, that just to understand those eyes medical science has divided the body in parts. There are millions of parts in the body, and as science grows more divisions have to be made. But those divisions are just workable, utilitarian – you are not divided.\nI have heard one story. Once it happened, one master had two disciples and they both were always competing. Who was the head, who was the chief disciple, was always the competition and the problem. And they were always competing with each other to gain the master’s heart.\nOne summer afternoon the master was tired and was sleeping. The disciples wanted to serve him, to massage his body, so the master said, “Okay. Number one, you take my left side. Number two, you take my right side and massage.” The master fell asleep. They drew a line with chalk on his body, because one should not enter into the other’s territory.\nBut it happened the master was not aware that he had been divided. He was fast asleep, and he didn’t know that now he was not one, but two. So he moved in his sleep, and put his right leg on his left. The disciple to whom the left leg belonged said, “Take away your right leg. Remove it immediately! You are interfering with my work. This is a transgression!”\nBut the other said, “I cannot remove it. I have not put it on your leg. And if you have any courage, then remove it yourself and see what happens!”\nNow they were standing with two sticks, and they were almost going to beat the master. Suddenly the master became aware that something was wrong, so he asked, “What is happening?”\nBoth said, “You need not interfere. Remain silent and go to sleep. We will decide by ourselves.”\nAll divisions are workable, life remains one. The path and the goal and the stages, they are just to help you, so don’t take them dogmatically and don’t take them literally. These seven stages are just to help you, to give you a view of the whole path. When you have understood forget that they are seven. But until you have understood follow the division. When you have understood forget the division – it is one progression, one flow.\nAnd thirdly: “Does this happening occur suddenly and unexpectedly?”\nBoth things can be said. It cannot be predicted, so it happens suddenly. Nobody can say when it will happen. My own disciples go on asking me, “When? Give the date, the day, the month, the year!” And I have to go on lying to them. I go on saying, “Soon!” Soon doesn’t mean anything. And soon is a beautiful word, because I need never change it. Whenever you ask I will say, “Soon!”\nThe happening is unpredictable because it is so vast a phenomenon. And it is not mechanical, it is not mathematical, so you cannot conclude about it. And it is very mysterious; when it has happened, only then you know that it has happened. So in a sense, because it is unpredictable it is always sudden. Even you don’t know when it will happen. Suddenly one day when it has happened you become aware that it has happened. Not even a single moment before will you be aware that this is going to happen. You will become aware only when it has happened already. Then you will feel that you are no more the same, the man who was there has disappeared and a new man is there in his place – somebody new. You are unacquainted, you cannot recognize yourself. There has been a gap, the old continuity has been broken and something new has come into its place.\nEven your master cannot predict it. He may become aware that something is going to happen, but he cannot predict it. There are problems – because even the prediction will change the whole situation. This is the problem, even the prediction will change it. If I become aware that something is going to happen to you tomorrow morning, I cannot say it because that will change the whole situation. If I say, “Tomorrow morning this is going to happen,” you will become tense and you will start expecting and you will start waiting. You will not be able to sleep in the night. Then the whole thing is finished, then it is not going to happen tomorrow morning.\nEven if your master becomes aware... because there are signs that show that something is going to happen. Your master can see that you are pregnant, he can feel, but it is not such a fixed affair that within nine months the child will be born. You may take nine years, you may take nine lives, you may not take even nine days; even nine moments may be enough. It depends, and it depends on such multidimensional things that nothing can be said. And if something is said, the very assertion will change the whole situation. So the master has to wait, just watch and not say anything.\nIn this sense it is sudden, but in another sense it is not sudden, because you have to make efforts for it, you have to prepare. You have to prepare the ground, you have to open the doors. The guest may come suddenly, but if your doors are closed he may come and go back. So you have to open the doors, you have to clean the house, you have to prepare food for the guest – you have to be ready. You have to watch and wait at the door – any moment the guest can come.\nJesus goes on telling one anecdote many times. Once it happened, a great landlord went on a journey. He told all his slaves and servants, “Be alert constantly. Even in the night the house must be ready because I can come any moment. In the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening, at\nmidnight – any moment I can come, and my house must be ready, waiting for me. So twenty-four hours you have to watch and wait. Don’t go to sleep!”\nAnd so the servants had to wait and watch. There was no difference between day and night – the master could come any moment.\nJesus used to say, “Your master also can come any moment – you have to be ready. And if you are ready, your readiness also becomes a factor for his coming soon. If you are completely ready he may come back from midjourney. If your whole being is calling him, inviting him, he may come this very moment.”\nThe happening can happen any moment if you are ready. It is sudden because unpredictable; it is sudden because you cannot plan, calculate; it is sudden because it is not mechanical. But still you have to prepare for it, you have to be ready for it, and you have to do much before it can happen.\nIt is just as if you sow a seed in the ground. You prepare the ground and sow the seed – the right seed in the right season in a right place – and then wait. The sprouting will be sudden, you cannot determine it. You cannot say that on Monday morning the sprout will be there. It may not be, it may be, because millions of factors are working. Now scientists say that even music helps. If somebody is dancing and singing near that ground where you have sown the seed, it may help the seed to sprout quickly. If the moon is rising it will help the seed to sprout soon. If the moon is declining it will take more time.\nYou may not be aware that fullmoon night is different from any other night. More children are born on fullmoon night, more than on any other night. The highest number of children born is on the fullmoon night, and the lowest number is on the no-moon night. That factor goes on working; the whole constellation goes on working – every star is a factor. Even a beggar sitting there near your house and singing will help. If somebody passes, sad, miserable, the seed is affected; that sadness hinders.\nThere are millions of factors, unpredictable, complex, mysterious – but still you have to prepare everything. So don’t wait for the sudden. “Sudden” doesn’t mean that you need not do anything and it will happen any moment, suddenly. You will have to prepare, and then too it will happen suddenly. Your preparation will help, but it cannot plan, it cannot force.\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nIN THE PAST HYPNOSIS HAS BEEN TRIED ON ME, BUT I COULD NOT BE HYPNOTIZED. PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY MANY PERSONS ARE NOT HYPNOTIZABLE.\nThis will be important for you to understand. Ordinarily it is thought that those persons who cannot be hypnotized are powerful. This is absolutely wrong – and I say absolutely. The stronger the person the more easily he is hypnotized. The second wrong conception is that a very intelligent\nperson cannot be hypnotized. That too is absolutely wrong. The more stupid a person the less is the possibility of hypnotizing him. You cannot hypnotize an idiot – impossible. You cannot hypnotize a madman – impossible. The more intelligent a person the more easily he can be hypnotized.\nWhy? – because hypnosis needs cooperation; the basic factor is cooperation, your cooperation. The idiot cannot understand what you are demanding, what type of cooperation; the madman cannot understand what you are demanding. Only an intelligent person can cooperate, and hypnosis is possible only when you cooperate. So if you are paranoid, schizophrenic, neurotic, you cannot cooperate. If you are very much afraid, a fear complex is there, you cannot cooperate.\nA person who can trust can be hypnotized easily. A person who cannot trust anybody cannot be hypnotized – because the person who is hypnotizing is not using any force on you. This is again a wrong conception, the third, that the hypnotist is using some force. No, not at all. The hypnotist has no force to use; the hypnotist is only using your force, so you have to cooperate. If you don’t cooperate nobody can hypnotize you. And cooperation needs trust, because you will be unconscious and you don’t know what this man who is hypnotizing will do to you.\nSo look, I have been experimenting on many things. A Western woman is more easily hypnotized than an Eastern woman, because the Eastern woman is always afraid of sex. When she is unconscious, who knows what this hypnotist may do? Western women in that sense have become freer, less afraid. They can be hypnotized more easily.\nA person who is guilty about something is very difficult to hypnotize, because he is always afraid that when he is unconscious the thing he is hiding may come up. A person who has committed some sin, or thinks he has committed some sin and is hiding it, will be very difficult to hypnotize. Only a simple, innocent person can be hypnotized, because he has nothing to hide. You cannot bring anything out; he has no secrets. If you have secrets and you don’t want them to be exposed you cannot trust anybody – because hypnosis means that your unconscious is available to the hypnotist. He can penetrate deep down, he can bring out anything that you are hiding.\nSo those persons are not hypnotizable who fall into these categories. The less guilty and less afraid, and the more intelligent, trusting and cooperative a person is, the more hypnotizable. So don’t think that if you cannot be hypnotized you are something great. You may be simply ill, pathological. If you can be hypnotized you show a quality of trust and you show that you are imaginative. You show that suggestions can catch you and your imagination can work through them. You are an imaginatively creative person.\nBut remember that unless you cooperate nobody can hypnotize you – nobody. Even if Mesmer comes he cannot hypnotize you if you don’t cooperate. Your cooperation is needed, your total willingness is needed. And then too you are not completely in the control of the hypnotist. A part of you remains alert even then, and if the hypnotist is going to force you to do something against yourself you will suddenly come out of hypnosis.\nIt happened, one of my brothers was serving in an office. He trusts me, and I wanted him to leave that service. But he is such a person that whatsoever the situation he does not like to change it. He was not getting good pay, the office was in every way useless, there was no possibility for creative growth, so I was saying to him, “Leave that office.” But he is the type that wants to continue whatsoever is going on with no change. So I hypnotized him.\nHe trusts me in every way, but that day he was mistrustful, because he was aware that if he was hypnotized I was going to say, “Leave that service!” Everything was okay, he followed, but a part of him must have remained aware, alert, in case I suggested that thing. So he followed everything, he didn’t even feel the pin. I tested in every way and he was hypnotized completely, there was no possibility that he wasn’t. And then I said, “Leave that service!” Immediately he came out of hypnosis and he said, “Don’t say that!”\nNothing, even in hypnosis, can be forced on you if you are not willing; even after hypnosis has happened nothing can be forced upon you. So if something can be forced that shows that unconsciously you were willing.\nFor example, a woman who cannot think of kissing any man other than her lover – if it is suggested to her under hypnosis to kiss somebody else, and if really she does not want to kiss anybody, immediately she will come out of hypnosis. But if she goes and kisses the other person, and then after she has come out of hypnosis you tell her and she says, “What could I do? I was hypnotized,” then this is just a trick – unconsciously she wanted to kiss him.\nConsciously she is alert and she will say, “No, I cannot touch any other man than my own lover. I belong to one,” but this is only conscious – unconsciously she must have been hankering. Only then, in hypnosis, can this be forced; otherwise in hypnosis also this cannot be forced, it is impossible. You have to cooperate with whatsoever the hypnotist forces on you. The moment your cooperation is taken back, immediately hypnosis disappears. So many reasons are possible why a person is not hypnotizable, but don’t think of it as a good quality. Become more imaginative, cooperative, trusting, and hypnosis can be helpful.\nIn the old days, particularly in the East, hypnosis was used in every ashram. The master used it in every way to help you, because consciously you may take years to do a particular thing but in hypnosis, through hypnosis, within seconds it can be done. Unnecessary effort can be saved. But only masters were allowed to hypnotize. Hypnosis remained a secret science in the East; it was not used publicly because there are possibilities of misusing it.\nIn the West Mesmer brought hypnosis into the market, and then everything which was associated with it became condemned. But now again the wheel is turning. In the West also universities are studying it; there are scientific projects to study hypnosis, and new research is again bringing hypnosis to the status of a science. It can be used now, it is already used, in hospitals in surgery – because there is no need to give an anesthetic; that is destructive to the body, it unnecessarily harms the body. There is no need, simple hypnosis can make you unconscious. There is no need for chloroform or any poison, any gas, to make you unconscious; only your cooperation is needed. And any operation is possible under hypnosis. Even if it takes hours, even if many hours are needed, hypnosis is enough, no anesthetic is needed.\nMany hospitals have started using it. Childbirth can be made absolutely painless; not only that, it can easily be made pleasureable, ecstatic, under hypnosis. The mother just has to cooperate and trust, and then she can be hypnotized and it can be suggested that there will be no pain when the child comes out of the womb, but rather on the contrary there will be intense pleasure. And it is possible that the woman, the mother giving birth, can have such a deep orgasm through birth that no sexual orgasm can be any comparison to it – because the same mechanism is involved. The\nsame mechanism which gives the sexual orgasm, the bliss that comes through sex, is involved, and involved more totally. The child passes through the same passage.\nOnce the woman feels – and the suggestion is there – that this is going to be a very ecstatic feeling, she will achieve a peak. And I think that in the past women used to achieve that peak; they have lost that capacity. Not only lost – birth has become painful. This is again a suggestion.\nYou can see: the more civilized a society, the more pain in childbirth; the less civilized a society, the less pain. In India there are many primitives who don’t know any pain in childbirth, no pain at all. And there are some tribes on the earth even today in Tibet and in other interior parts of Mongolia, where women go simply mad in ecstasy when the child is born. And that may be the reason why every woman deeply longs to be a mother. No man longs to be a father, he wants to be a husband; no woman simply longs to be a wife, she wants to be a mother. That’s a basic difference.\nI think the reason is that in the old days, in very ancient days, women used to achieve the supreme pleasure of their life through childbirth. That has remained in their unconscious still – they want to be a mother. A father is just a formality. You don’t achieve anything through becoming a father; you don’t give any birth, you are just a spectator. So the father is just a social convention. The mother is a natural phenomenon. The father can be discarded any day, it is just institutional; the mother is a natural phenomenon.\nEvery woman longs to be a mother, only then does she feel fulfilled. This feeling must be based on some ecstasy that was there in the beginning and which women have lost. It is just a suggestion that childbirth is painful, but through centuries it has gone deep. It can be changed.\nMany illnesses can simply disappear through hypnosis because really they don’t exist, they are just in your mind. Fifty percent of illnesses are just in the mind, they don’t have any organic existence. They can simply disappear. There is no need for any medicine, any injection or any “pathies” to be worked on you, because then those medicines poison you, your body goes toxic, and then you suffer. You suffer less from your illnesses, more from your medicines. And there are so many doctors that you can escape death but you cannot escape the doctors – they will kill you in the end. Whatsoever you do they will kill you. Fifty percent of diseases can simply disappear from the earth.\nHypnosis is a great force, but with every force there is danger – it can be misused. But just because a force can be misused you need not go against it... because anything can be misused, and if it can be misused that shows it can be used also. So become more vulnerable, become more suggestible, become more available to hypnosis. That means you will become more intelligent, more cooperative, more trusting.\nEnough for today.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7956","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/vedanta_seven_steps_to_samadhi/part9/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/vedanta_seven_steps_to_samadhi/>Vedanta.

Abu, Rajasthan, India</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IS VAIRAGYA, NONATTACHMENT, A METHOD, A MEANS, AN INTERMEDIATE STAGE,
OR AN END IN ITSELF?</p><p><br></p><p>It is all – because means and ends are not two things. The way and
the goal are not two things. The way is just the beginning of the goal,
and the goal is just the ending of the way. So please, don’t divide, and
don’t think in terms of the means being different from the end. Means
are the end. Once you can conceive of this, the quality of your effort
will change immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily mind is always concerned with the end; means are used,
exploited, to reach the end. If you could avoid the means you would like
to avoid them; if you could achieve the end directly without any means,
if you could reach the goal without the way, without the path, you would
like to do so. You would like to reach the goal immediately. The mind
divides ends and means; end is meaningful, means are just necessary,
they have to be suffered.</p><p><br></p><p>This is how the ordinary mind functions, and because of this
whatsoever you do becomes a suffering – because you have to pass through
the path, you have to use means, methods, and therein is all suffering.
Happiness is in the goal, somewhere in the future, not here and now.
Here and now will be means and the end will be somewhere else, somewhere
in the future, tomorrow – so today will always be a suffering.</p><p>And remember, if your today is a suffering your tomorrow cannot be a
happiness, because it is born of today, it comes out of this moment. The
future comes out of the present, so whatsoever the present the same will
remain in the future. If you are suffering now you will suffer then
also. If you are suffering here you will find the hell there also –
because who will find that heaven which you think is there? You? Your
whole attitude creates the suffering.</p><p><br></p><p>So those who are on the spiritual path must be aware of this tendency
of the mind. Forget the end and look at the means as if they are the
end, and enjoy them as if they are the goal. Then the very path becomes
blissful, the very journey itself becomes blissful. Every step becomes
blissful, because you are not waiting for the bliss, for the next step.
And out of this blissful step the next is going to be born – it will be
more blissful. The tomorrow will be more blissful if today is blissful,
and the bliss will grow.</p><p><br></p><p>We are doing meditations. These meditations are means, but they are
goals also; so don’t try to exploit them, otherwise you will be in a
hurry, you will constantly think of how to be finished with them and
reach the goal. Then you will never be able to be finished with them and
the goal will always remain illusory, always like the horizon, always
distant. And the more you move ahead, the goal will also move ahead in
the same proportion.</p><p><br></p><p>Ends and means are not two things. Don’t divide. The end is just the
flowering of the means, the end is just the realization of the means.
The end is hidden in the means, just like the tree is hidden in the
seed. The seed is the tree. Don’t look at the seed as if the seed has
some secondary importance and the tree is meaningful and significant,
and you can avoid the seed. If you avoid the seed the tree will never be
there. Take care of the seed, love the seed, give soil to it, prepare
the ground, and help the seed to grow. It will become the tree. It is
already the tree unmanifest.</p><p><br></p><p>So let me say it in this way: means are the unmanifest end, and end
is the manifest means. Means are seeds, and ends will be the trees, the
flowering – so love the means as the end.</p><p><br></p><p>Vairagya is all, nonattachment is all. It is the beginning, it is the
middle, it is the end. It is a method, it is an intermediate stage, it
is the goal. Desirelessness is the end – but the end must be there in
the beginning, only then can it grow. So desirelessness is both the
first step and the last also. Of course the quality will differ. In the
first step the desirelessness will be with effort, in the intermediate
stage desirelessness will have become unconscious effort. In the
beginning it will be conscious effort, you will have to do it; in the
middle it will start happening, it will have become unconscious effort.
Effort will be there, but indirect, unconscious. In the end it will be
spontaneous, effort will have completely disappeared. But desirelessness
is the same. Desirelessness in the beginning is with conscious effort,
in the middle is with unconscious effort, in the end is effortless.</p><p><br></p><p>Avoid this tendency to divide, to cut things, and see that every
phenomenon is a continuity, everything is joined together. Even those
things which look opposite are also joined together, they are also
polarities. Develop this way of looking at things – that will be very
helpful. For those who are really sincerely interested in traveling this
inner path, this approach of nondividing is a must.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question: Question 2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>ARE THERE REALLY DISCRETE STAGES ON THE WAY TO THE ULTIMATE
HAPPENING, AS THIS UPANISHAD SEEMS TO SUGGEST, OR DOES THIS HAPPENING
OCCUR SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY? IS IT A MATTER OF LONG CONSCIOUS
EFFORT, OR OF A SUDDEN TOTAL SURRENDER TO EXISTENCE?</p><p><br></p><p>It is both. You have to make all effort that is possible, that you
can do. No stone should be left unturned, no energies should be left
unused. You must get totally involved. You are required to work as a
unit, only then the flowering, the happening, will become possible. But
that doesn’t mean that it is an outcome of your effort; just by your
effort it is not going to happen. This is a little delicate and you will
have to be very penetrating about it, then only will you understand.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at it in this way. You see a person walking on the street.
Suddenly you have a feeling that you remember the face or you feel that
you even know the name, and you say it is just on the tip of your
tongue, but it is not coming. The more effort you make the more
frustrated you feel – it is not coming. But you cannot leave it at that,
because you have the feeling that you know this face, you know the name.
And there is even this feeling that somewhere, just in the corner of the
mind, the name is waiting, you have only to recall it.</p><p><br></p><p>You make all effort, you try in every way. You close your eyes, you
contemplate, you ponder over it, you try to associate, you go into the
past, you start feeling for some key, some clue, but nothing happens.
You get frustrated, bored; you leave the whole effort, and you go into
the garden and start working, or you start smoking, or you take a cup of
tea. Suddenly the name is there, suddenly the memory has come, suddenly
you have recognized.</p><p><br></p><p>Now two things are happening. One: you are making every effort
possible, but it is not coming through the effort. Then you leave all
the effort, and then it comes. Effort is needed but is not enough. If
you don’t make any effort it will not come when you go to the garden or
when you take a cup of tea. If you have not made total effort it is not
going to come. And if you make just the effort – total even – then too
it is not going to come. So total effort is needed, then total
relaxation also – then it will bubble up.</p><p><br></p><p>Many Nobel prizes have been given for certain discoveries which
happened in this way. One Nobel prize winner was working on the inner
structure of the human cell, the lymph cell. He was working for years,
contemplating, brooding, making many experiments, and nothing was
happening, every effort was a failure. After many years of research,
effort, failure, one night suddenly he had a dream, and in the dream he
saw the structure, the very structure he was looking for, the structure
of the human cell, just as if a magnified picture was there. He got up.
Immediately he drew the drawing and then he worked on it, and it proved
that the dream was true.</p><p><br></p><p>But remember, you are not going to have this dream, it cannot happen
to you. It happened after so many years of effort. The conscious was
exhausted. The conscious did everything that could be done and then the
conscious was tired, the conscious mind was finished, the conscious
accepted the failure. When the conscious is exhausted the unconscious
comes into focus and starts working – but it comes only when the
conscious is exhausted. If the conscious is still hoping, if the
conscious is still trying, then the unconscious will not function. And
this is one of the basic laws of the human psyche: that if you want the
unconscious to function, exhaust the conscious completely.</p><p>Effort will not lead you to enlightenment, but without effort no one
has ever achieved it. This may look like a paradox. It is not, it is a
simple law.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha tried for six years continuously, and no man has tried as
totally as Buddha did. He made every effort possible, he went to every
master available. There was not a single master Buddha did not go to. He
surrendered to every master, and whatsoever was said he did so perfectly
that even the master started feeling jealous. And every master finally
had to say to Buddha, “This is all I can teach. And if nothing is
happening I cannot blame you, because you are doing everything so
perfectly. I am helpless. You will have to move to some other
teacher.”</p><p><br></p><p>This rarely happens because disciples never do everything so
perfectly, so the master can always say, “Because you are not doing
well, that’s why nothing is happening.” But Buddha was doing so well, so
absolutely well, that no master could say to him, “You are not doing
well.” So they had to accept defeat. They had to say, “This is all we
can teach, and you have done it and nothing is happening, so it is
better you move to some other master. You don’t belong to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha moved for six years, and he followed even absurd techniques
when they were taught to him. Somebody said “Fast,” so for months he
fasted. For six months he was continuously fasting, just taking a very
small quantity of food every fifteen days, only twice a month. He became
so weak that he was simply a skeleton. All flesh disappeared, he looked
like a dead man. He became so weak that he couldn’t even walk. He
finally became so weak that he would close his eyes to meditate and he
would fall down in a fit.</p><p><br></p><p>One day he was taking a bath in the river Niranjana, just near
Bodhgaya, and he was so weak that he couldn’t cross the river. He fell
down in the river and he thought that he was going to be drowned; it was
the last moment, death had come. He was so weak he couldn’t swim. Then
suddenly he caught hold of a branch of a tree and remained there. And
there for the first time the thought came to his mind, “If I have become
so weak that I cannot cross this ordinary small river in summertime when
the water has gone completely, when there is no more water and it is
very small, just a little stream – if I cannot cross this little stream,
how can I cross this big ocean of the world, bhavasagar? How can I
transcend this world? It seems impossible. I am doing something stupid.
What to do?”</p><p><br></p><p>He came out of the river in the evening and sat under a tree, which
became the bodhi tree, and that evening when the moon was coming up – it
was a fullmoon night – he realized that every effort is useless. He
realized that nothing can be achieved, the very idea of achievement is
nonsense. He had done everything. He was finished with the world, with
the world of desires. He was a king and he had known every desire, he
had lived every desire. He was finished with them, there was nothing to
be achieved, there was nothing worthwhile. And then for six years he had
been trying all austerities, all efforts, all meditations, yoga,
everything, and nothing was happening. So he said, “Now there is nothing
more except to die. There is nothing to be achieved, and every concept
of achievement is nonsense; human desire is but futile.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he dropped all effort that evening. He sat under the tree,
relaxed, with no effort, no goal, nowhere to go, nothing to be achieved,
nothing worth achieving. When you are in such a state of mind, mind
relaxes – no future, no desire, no goal, nowhere to go, so what to do?
He simply sat, he became just like the tree. The whole night he slept,
and later on Buddha said that for the first time he really slept that
night – because when effort is there it continues in sleep also.</p><p>A person who is earning money and who is after money goes on counting
even in his dreams, a person who is after power and prestige and
politics goes on fighting elections in his dreams. You all know that
when you are sitting for an examination in the university or college, in
sleep also you go on doing the examination; again and again you are in
the examination hall answering questions. So whatsoever effort is there
it continues in sleep – and there is always some effort for something or
other.</p><p><br></p><p>That night there was no effort. Buddha said, “I slept for the first
time in millions of lives. That was the first night that I slept.” Such
a sleep becomes samadhi. And in the morning when he awoke he saw the
last star disappear. He looked. His eyes for the first time must have
been mirrorlike, with no content, just vacant, empty, nothing to
project. The last star was disappearing, and Buddha said, “With that
disappearing star I also disappeared. The star was disappearing and I
also disappeared” – because the ego can exist only with effort. If you
make some effort ego is fed – you are doing something, you are reaching
somewhere, you are achieving something. When there is no effort how can
you exist?</p><p><br></p><p>The last star disappeared, “And,” Buddha said, “I also disappeared.
And then I looked, the sky was vacant; then I looked within, there was
nothing – anatta, no self, there was no one.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is said Buddha laughed at the whole absurdity. There was no one
who could reach. There was no one who could reach the goal, there was no
one who could achieve liberation – there was no one at all, no entity.
Space was without, space was within. “And,” he said, “at that moment of
total effortlessness I achieved, I realized.” But don’t go to relax
under a tree, and don’t wait for the last star to disappear. And don’t
wait thinking that with the last star disappearing you will disappear.
Those six years must precede. So this is the problem: without effort no
one has ever achieved, with only effort no one has ever achieved. With
effort coming to a point where it becomes effortlessness, realization
has always been possible.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what I go on emphasizing for you to do: make as much effort
as you can, and don’t withhold any energy. Bring your total energy into
it so you get exhausted, so the conscious mind cannot make any more
effort. When the conscious cannot do anything, suddenly the unconscious
reveals. And it reveals only when the conscious has become a total
failure, only then it is needed – otherwise it goes on sleeping
inside.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like this. Every human body has three layers of energies.
The first layer is only for day-to-day work: eating, sleeping, walking
to the office, working in the office, coming home, fighting, making
love, anger – routine. The first layer. It has not got very much energy,
just routine energy.</p><p><br></p><p>The second layer is for emergency situations. Unless the first is
exhausted the second is not available. You are tired. You have come from
the office, the boss has been very insulting. You come home and the wife
is very bad-tempered, the children are creating noise, and the whole
house is a mess. You feel tired and dead, and suddenly you find that the
house has caught fire, it is on fire. Tiredness disappears immediately.
You need not do anything, you don’t even have to take a cup of coffee.
Tiredness is no more. The house is on fire, and you have got so much
energy that you can work the whole night. From where is this energy
coming? The first layer is exhausted, and an emergency is there – the
second layer becomes available.</p><p>And there is a third layer which is the real source, the source of
all energy. You may call it the infinite source, the elan vital. When
the second layer is also exhausted, only then the third becomes
available. And when the third is available you are totally different:
you have become divine, because now the source is infinite, you cannot
exhaust it.</p><p><br></p><p>We live on the first layer and only sometimes in emergencies,
accidents, in some dangerous situations where life is at stake, does the
second become available. The third remains almost unavailable. All the
effort in spiritual sadhana, discipline, is to exhaust the first. Then
austerities, arduous efforts, are to exhaust the second. When the second
is exhausted you fall into the ocean, and it can never be exhausted. And
from that source, the original source – you may call it God, or
whatsoever you like – from that original source, once a contact is made,
you are totally different. This is what liberation means, this is what
becoming infinite means, this is what Jesus used to call the kingdom of
God.</p><p><br></p><p>But remember, you cannot just slip into it, it is not available. You
have to exhaust the first layer and the second layer, only then it
becomes available. Effort is needed to exhaust these layers, and then
effortlessness is needed to enter the original source.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing to be understood: effort is needed, but effort
alone is not enough – effort and then effortlessness, effort plus
effortlessness. Effort precedes, and then effortlessness follows.
Effortlessness is the peak of effort, it comes only when you have
reached the peak. And this is so difficult to conceive that there are
many misunderstandings.</p><p><br></p><p>In Japan, Zen, which is an offshoot of the Indian dhyana, says no
effort is needed. And it is right. Because of this Zen has become very
influential in the West. And the West has created its own Zen writers –
they are Zen writers, not Zen masters. And it has much appeal; no effort
is needed, you can become enlightened without any effort. So in the West
there are many Zen writers, Zen painters, Zen haiku poets – and they are
all bogus, because they have taken this idea.</p><p><br></p><p>This idea is very appealing, that there is no need of any effort. If
there is no need of any effort, then as you are you are a master, you
are enlightened, you have become a siddha. But then look at the Zen
monasteries in Japan. If you read Zen scriptures, there it is written
that there is no need of effort. But then go to the Zen monastery and
look: for twenty years, thirty years, a seeker has to make all the
efforts. Then the moment comes when that scripture becomes applicable –
then, no effort.</p><p><br></p><p>Effort will lead you to no effort, and this is a basic law. You can
understand if you try to observe your own life. For example, if in the
day you have been working hard, sleep will be deep in the night. If you
have been working hard, exerting hard, then sleep will be good. If you
have slept well in the night, then in the morning you will be capable of
doing much hard work again. Hard work is against relaxation, it is the
opposite. This would be more logical – that you sleep the whole day,
rest, and then in the night you fall into deeper sleep because you have
been practicing sleep the whole day. This should be the logic – that a
man who has been practicing sleep the whole day must sleep better in the
night than others who have not been practicing so much.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin once went to his doctor. He had a cold and had been
coughing for many days. As he was entering his doctor’s office he
coughed. The doctor heard and said, “Nasruddin, it sounds better.”</p><p>Nasruddin said, “Of course it must because I have been practicing for
three months.”</p><p><br></p><p>But logic is not life. If you sleep and rest the whole day you will
not be able to rest at all in the night. That’s what is happening with
rich people in affluent societies. Insomnia is a luxury, not everybody
can afford it. To attain insomnia you have to rest for the whole day. If
you can afford that much rest, only then is insomnia possible. A poor
man cannot afford it. He has to fall in deep sleep, he is helpless. He
has been working hard the whole day.</p><p><br></p><p>But work is against rest, so it is not logical – but this is the
logic of life. Life depends on opposites, life depends on opposite
polarities. Logic is linear, life is polar. Logic moves in a line, life
moves in a circle. So a person who has been relaxing will not be able to
relax in the night, a person who has been working hard the whole day
will be able to relax.</p><p><br></p><p>Or look at it from another angle. A person who is always loving,
never angry, really cannot be loving. Ordinary logic will say that a
person can be loving in the morning, loving in the noon, loving in the
evening, loving in the night; always loving in summer, always loving in
winter – every season, every moment loving. This love is not humanly
possible, because the opposite is needed. He must sometimes become
angry. That anger relaxes, that anger becomes the valley and then peaks
of love can arise again.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want only peaks and no valleys, you are mad. Only peaks cannot
exist. With every peak at least two valleys will be needed, and only
between two valleys is one peak possible. So a person who is always
loving is possible only in two ways. One is that he is not human. That
means he must be a buddha, who can be always loving. But then his love
cannot have any intensity, his love will be very silent. His love will
not be like a peak, it will be just plain straight ground.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why a buddha’s love can only be called compassion, it cannot
be called love. There is no passion in it, it is compassion. There can
be no intensity in it, because intensity comes from the opposite. A
buddha is never angry, so from where can the intensity come?</p><p><br></p><p>In ordinary life you have to be angry, then you regain love. In
marriage there is no need for the final divorce if every day you can
divorce a little. In the morning divorce, in the evening remarriage,
then things move beautifully. And if you go on postponing this everyday
divorce then finally you will have to break, then separation is a must.
Life is polarity, and this applies to everything. Effort plus
effortlessness – they are the polar opposites. The ultimate is reached
through effort and effortlessness, so don’t cling to one – remember
both.</p><p><br></p><p>Both the parties exist; there are a few persons who go on clinging to
the method, effort, and then they go on making effort. Even if nirvana
has been reached they cannot be stopped. They will go on breathing, they
will say, “We cannot stop. Effort is needed.” So even if God is standing
before them they will go on doing chaotic breathing; they will not look,
they will not look and see what has happened. They are too much attached
to the method and the effort.</p><p><br></p><p>And then there is the other polar opposite party. They say, “If no
effort is needed then why breathe at all?” So they are sitting just
waiting for the last star to disappear so that they can become buddhas.
Both are wrong. You have to breathe and you have to stop also. You have
to make all efforts and then relax also. If these are both possible,
only then will you create the rhythm through which every growth becomes
possible.</p><p>The second thing: “Are there really discrete stages on the way to the
ultimate happening, as this Upanishad seems to suggest?”</p><p><br></p><p>There are no stages. Life cannot be divided. But without division
there is no possibility for you to understand. I call this part of my
body my hand; this part of my body my head – but can they be divided?
Where my head begins and where it ends – can you draw the line? Nowhere
can the line be drawn. Where my legs end, where my hand ends – can you
draw a line? No line can be drawn, because inside I am one – my hands,
my legs, my head, they are one. But we have to divide to understand.
Division is just to help understanding, it is not actual fact.</p><p><br></p><p>So this Upanishad is dividing, not because divisions are there, but
because you will not be able to understand the whole. The whole will be
too much, too complex. The whole will be incomprehensible, and
understanding will not be possible. That’s why the division into seven
stages, and that’s why there are so many divisions. You can divide in
fourteen, you can divide in seventeen – you can divide into as many as
you like. And theologicians go on fighting about these divisions. They
are workable, utilitarian – not existential.</p><p><br></p><p>Just feel your body, close your eyes and feel. Where are the
divisions? It is one. But if your eyes are not functioning well you will
go to the eye specialist. And you know that eyes are not separate, they
are one with the body, so then why go to the eye specialist? You can go
to any doctor. The eye specialist has tried to understand eyes...
because eyes in themselves are such a big, such a complex phenomenon,
that just to understand those eyes medical science has divided the body
in parts. There are millions of parts in the body, and as science grows
more divisions have to be made. But those divisions are just workable,
utilitarian – you are not divided.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard one story. Once it happened, one master had two
disciples and they both were always competing. Who was the head, who was
the chief disciple, was always the competition and the problem. And they
were always competing with each other to gain the master’s heart.</p><p><br></p><p>One summer afternoon the master was tired and was sleeping. The
disciples wanted to serve him, to massage his body, so the master said,
“Okay. Number one, you take my left side. Number two, you take my right
side and massage.” The master fell asleep. They drew a line with chalk
on his body, because one should not enter into the other’s
territory.</p><p><br></p><p>But it happened the master was not aware that he had been divided. He
was fast asleep, and he didn’t know that now he was not one, but two. So
he moved in his sleep, and put his right leg on his left. The disciple
to whom the left leg belonged said, “Take away your right leg. Remove it
immediately! You are interfering with my work. This is a
transgression!”</p><p><br></p><p>But the other said, “I cannot remove it. I have not put it on your
leg. And if you have any courage, then remove it yourself and see what
happens!”</p><p><br></p><p>Now they were standing with two sticks, and they were almost going to
beat the master. Suddenly the master became aware that something was
wrong, so he asked, “What is happening?”</p><p><br></p><p>Both said, “You need not interfere. Remain silent and go to sleep. We
will decide by ourselves.”</p><p>All divisions are workable, life remains one. The path and the goal
and the stages, they are just to help you, so don’t take them
dogmatically and don’t take them literally. These seven stages are just
to help you, to give you a view of the whole path. When you have
understood forget that they are seven. But until you have understood
follow the division. When you have understood forget the division – it
is one progression, one flow.</p><p><br></p><p>And thirdly: “Does this happening occur suddenly and
unexpectedly?”</p><p><br></p><p>Both things can be said. It cannot be predicted, so it happens
suddenly. Nobody can say when it will happen. My own disciples go on
asking me, “When? Give the date, the day, the month, the year!” And I
have to go on lying to them. I go on saying, “Soon!” Soon doesn’t mean
anything. And soon is a beautiful word, because I need never change it.
Whenever you ask I will say, “Soon!”</p><p><br></p><p>The happening is unpredictable because it is so vast a phenomenon.
And it is not mechanical, it is not mathematical, so you cannot conclude
about it. And it is very mysterious; when it has happened, only then you
know that it has happened. So in a sense, because it is unpredictable it
is always sudden. Even you don’t know when it will happen. Suddenly one
day when it has happened you become aware that it has happened. Not even
a single moment before will you be aware that this is going to happen.
You will become aware only when it has happened already. Then you will
feel that you are no more the same, the man who was there has
disappeared and a new man is there in his place – somebody new. You are
unacquainted, you cannot recognize yourself. There has been a gap, the
old continuity has been broken and something new has come into its
place.</p><p><br></p><p>Even your master cannot predict it. He may become aware that
something is going to happen, but he cannot predict it. There are
problems – because even the prediction will change the whole situation.
This is the problem, even the prediction will change it. If I become
aware that something is going to happen to you tomorrow morning, I
cannot say it because that will change the whole situation. If I say,
“Tomorrow morning this is going to happen,” you will become tense and
you will start expecting and you will start waiting. You will not be
able to sleep in the night. Then the whole thing is finished, then it is
not going to happen tomorrow morning.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if your master becomes aware... because there are signs that
show that something is going to happen. Your master can see that you are
pregnant, he can feel, but it is not such a fixed affair that within
nine months the child will be born. You may take nine years, you may
take nine lives, you may not take even nine days; even nine moments may
be enough. It depends, and it depends on such multidimensional things
that nothing can be said. And if something is said, the very assertion
will change the whole situation. So the master has to wait, just watch
and not say anything.</p><p><br></p><p>In this sense it is sudden, but in another sense it is not sudden,
because you have to make efforts for it, you have to prepare. You have
to prepare the ground, you have to open the doors. The guest may come
suddenly, but if your doors are closed he may come and go back. So you
have to open the doors, you have to clean the house, you have to prepare
food for the guest – you have to be ready. You have to watch and wait at
the door – any moment the guest can come.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus goes on telling one anecdote many times. Once it happened, a
great landlord went on a journey. He told all his slaves and servants,
“Be alert constantly. Even in the night the house must be ready because
I can come any moment. In the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening,
at</p><p>midnight – any moment I can come, and my house must be ready, waiting
for me. So twenty-four hours you have to watch and wait. Don’t go to
sleep!”</p><p><br></p><p>And so the servants had to wait and watch. There was no difference
between day and night – the master could come any moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus used to say, “Your master also can come any moment – you have
to be ready. And if you are ready, your readiness also becomes a factor
for his coming soon. If you are completely ready he may come back from
midjourney. If your whole being is calling him, inviting him, he may
come this very moment.”</p><p><br></p><p>The happening can happen any moment if you are ready. It is sudden
because unpredictable; it is sudden because you cannot plan, calculate;
it is sudden because it is not mechanical. But still you have to prepare
for it, you have to be ready for it, and you have to do much before it
can happen.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just as if you sow a seed in the ground. You prepare the ground
and sow the seed – the right seed in the right season in a right place –
and then wait. The sprouting will be sudden, you cannot determine it.
You cannot say that on Monday morning the sprout will be there. It may
not be, it may be, because millions of factors are working. Now
scientists say that even music helps. If somebody is dancing and singing
near that ground where you have sown the seed, it may help the seed to
sprout quickly. If the moon is rising it will help the seed to sprout
soon. If the moon is declining it will take more time.</p><p><br></p><p>You may not be aware that fullmoon night is different from any other
night. More children are born on fullmoon night, more than on any other
night. The highest number of children born is on the fullmoon night, and
the lowest number is on the no-moon night. That factor goes on working;
the whole constellation goes on working – every star is a factor. Even a
beggar sitting there near your house and singing will help. If somebody
passes, sad, miserable, the seed is affected; that sadness hinders.</p><p><br></p><p>There are millions of factors, unpredictable, complex, mysterious –
but still you have to prepare everything. So don’t wait for the sudden.
“Sudden” doesn’t mean that you need not do anything and it will happen
any moment, suddenly. You will have to prepare, and then too it will
happen suddenly. Your preparation will help, but it cannot plan, it
cannot force.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IN THE PAST HYPNOSIS HAS BEEN TRIED ON ME, BUT I COULD NOT BE
HYPNOTIZED. PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY MANY PERSONS ARE NOT HYPNOTIZABLE.</p><p><br></p><p>This will be important for you to understand. Ordinarily it is
thought that those persons who cannot be hypnotized are powerful. This
is absolutely wrong – and I say absolutely. The stronger the person the
more easily he is hypnotized. The second wrong conception is that a very
intelligent</p><p>person cannot be hypnotized. That too is absolutely wrong. The more
stupid a person the less is the possibility of hypnotizing him. You
cannot hypnotize an idiot – impossible. You cannot hypnotize a madman –
impossible. The more intelligent a person the more easily he can be
hypnotized.</p><p><br></p><p>Why? – because hypnosis needs cooperation; the basic factor is
cooperation, your cooperation. The idiot cannot understand what you are
demanding, what type of cooperation; the madman cannot understand what
you are demanding. Only an intelligent person can cooperate, and
hypnosis is possible only when you cooperate. So if you are paranoid,
schizophrenic, neurotic, you cannot cooperate. If you are very much
afraid, a fear complex is there, you cannot cooperate.</p><p><br></p><p>A person who can trust can be hypnotized easily. A person who cannot
trust anybody cannot be hypnotized – because the person who is
hypnotizing is not using any force on you. This is again a wrong
conception, the third, that the hypnotist is using some force. No, not
at all. The hypnotist has no force to use; the hypnotist is only using
your force, so you have to cooperate. If you don’t cooperate nobody can
hypnotize you. And cooperation needs trust, because you will be
unconscious and you don’t know what this man who is hypnotizing will do
to you.</p><p><br></p><p>So look, I have been experimenting on many things. A Western woman is
more easily hypnotized than an Eastern woman, because the Eastern woman
is always afraid of sex. When she is unconscious, who knows what this
hypnotist may do? Western women in that sense have become freer, less
afraid. They can be hypnotized more easily.</p><p><br></p><p>A person who is guilty about something is very difficult to
hypnotize, because he is always afraid that when he is unconscious the
thing he is hiding may come up. A person who has committed some sin, or
thinks he has committed some sin and is hiding it, will be very
difficult to hypnotize. Only a simple, innocent person can be
hypnotized, because he has nothing to hide. You cannot bring anything
out; he has no secrets. If you have secrets and you don’t want them to
be exposed you cannot trust anybody – because hypnosis means that your
unconscious is available to the hypnotist. He can penetrate deep down,
he can bring out anything that you are hiding.</p><p><br></p><p>So those persons are not hypnotizable who fall into these categories.
The less guilty and less afraid, and the more intelligent, trusting and
cooperative a person is, the more hypnotizable. So don’t think that if
you cannot be hypnotized you are something great. You may be simply ill,
pathological. If you can be hypnotized you show a quality of trust and
you show that you are imaginative. You show that suggestions can catch
you and your imagination can work through them. You are an imaginatively
creative person.</p><p><br></p><p>But remember that unless you cooperate nobody can hypnotize you –
nobody. Even if Mesmer comes he cannot hypnotize you if you don’t
cooperate. Your cooperation is needed, your total willingness is needed.
And then too you are not completely in the control of the hypnotist. A
part of you remains alert even then, and if the hypnotist is going to
force you to do something against yourself you will suddenly come out of
hypnosis.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened, one of my brothers was serving in an office. He trusts
me, and I wanted him to leave that service. But he is such a person that
whatsoever the situation he does not like to change it. He was not
getting good pay, the office was in every way useless, there was no
possibility for creative growth, so I was saying to him, “Leave that
office.” But he is the type that wants to continue whatsoever is going
on with no change. So I hypnotized him.</p><p>He trusts me in every way, but that day he was mistrustful, because
he was aware that if he was hypnotized I was going to say, “Leave that
service!” Everything was okay, he followed, but a part of him must have
remained aware, alert, in case I suggested that thing. So he followed
everything, he didn’t even feel the pin. I tested in every way and he
was hypnotized completely, there was no possibility that he wasn’t. And
then I said, “Leave that service!” Immediately he came out of hypnosis
and he said, “Don’t say that!”</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing, even in hypnosis, can be forced on you if you are not
willing; even after hypnosis has happened nothing can be forced upon
you. So if something can be forced that shows that unconsciously you
were willing.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, a woman who cannot think of kissing any man other than
her lover – if it is suggested to her under hypnosis to kiss somebody
else, and if really she does not want to kiss anybody, immediately she
will come out of hypnosis. But if she goes and kisses the other person,
and then after she has come out of hypnosis you tell her and she says,
“What could I do? I was hypnotized,” then this is just a trick –
unconsciously she wanted to kiss him.</p><p><br></p><p>Consciously she is alert and she will say, “No, I cannot touch any
other man than my own lover. I belong to one,” but this is only
conscious – unconsciously she must have been hankering. Only then, in
hypnosis, can this be forced; otherwise in hypnosis also this cannot be
forced, it is impossible. You have to cooperate with whatsoever the
hypnotist forces on you. The moment your cooperation is taken back,
immediately hypnosis disappears. So many reasons are possible why a
person is not hypnotizable, but don’t think of it as a good quality.
Become more imaginative, cooperative, trusting, and hypnosis can be
helpful.</p><p><br></p><p>In the old days, particularly in the East, hypnosis was used in every
ashram. The master used it in every way to help you, because consciously
you may take years to do a particular thing but in hypnosis, through
hypnosis, within seconds it can be done. Unnecessary effort can be
saved. But only masters were allowed to hypnotize. Hypnosis remained a
secret science in the East; it was not used publicly because there are
possibilities of misusing it.</p><p><br></p><p>In the West Mesmer brought hypnosis into the market, and then
everything which was associated with it became condemned. But now again
the wheel is turning. In the West also universities are studying it;
there are scientific projects to study hypnosis, and new research is
again bringing hypnosis to the status of a science. It can be used now,
it is already used, in hospitals in surgery – because there is no need
to give an anesthetic; that is destructive to the body, it unnecessarily
harms the body. There is no need, simple hypnosis can make you
unconscious. There is no need for chloroform or any poison, any gas, to
make you unconscious; only your cooperation is needed. And any operation
is possible under hypnosis. Even if it takes hours, even if many hours
are needed, hypnosis is enough, no anesthetic is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Many hospitals have started using it. Childbirth can be made
absolutely painless; not only that, it can easily be made pleasureable,
ecstatic, under hypnosis. The mother just has to cooperate and trust,
and then she can be hypnotized and it can be suggested that there will
be no pain when the child comes out of the womb, but rather on the
contrary there will be intense pleasure. And it is possible that the
woman, the mother giving birth, can have such a deep orgasm through
birth that no sexual orgasm can be any comparison to it – because the
same mechanism is involved. The</p><p>same mechanism which gives the sexual orgasm, the bliss that comes
through sex, is involved, and involved more totally. The child passes
through the same passage.</p><p><br></p><p>Once the woman feels – and the suggestion is there – that this is
going to be a very ecstatic feeling, she will achieve a peak. And I
think that in the past women used to achieve that peak; they have lost
that capacity. Not only lost – birth has become painful. This is again a
suggestion.</p><p><br></p><p>You can see: the more civilized a society, the more pain in
childbirth; the less civilized a society, the less pain. In India there
are many primitives who don’t know any pain in childbirth, no pain at
all. And there are some tribes on the earth even today in Tibet and in
other interior parts of Mongolia, where women go simply mad in ecstasy
when the child is born. And that may be the reason why every woman
deeply longs to be a mother. No man longs to be a father, he wants to be
a husband; no woman simply longs to be a wife, she wants to be a mother.
That’s a basic difference.</p><p><br></p><p>I think the reason is that in the old days, in very ancient days,
women used to achieve the supreme pleasure of their life through
childbirth. That has remained in their unconscious still – they want to
be a mother. A father is just a formality. You don’t achieve anything
through becoming a father; you don’t give any birth, you are just a
spectator. So the father is just a social convention. The mother is a
natural phenomenon. The father can be discarded any day, it is just
institutional; the mother is a natural phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>Every woman longs to be a mother, only then does she feel fulfilled.
This feeling must be based on some ecstasy that was there in the
beginning and which women have lost. It is just a suggestion that
childbirth is painful, but through centuries it has gone deep. It can be
changed.</p><p><br></p><p>Many illnesses can simply disappear through hypnosis because really
they don’t exist, they are just in your mind. Fifty percent of illnesses
are just in the mind, they don’t have any organic existence. They can
simply disappear. There is no need for any medicine, any injection or
any “pathies” to be worked on you, because then those medicines poison
you, your body goes toxic, and then you suffer. You suffer less from
your illnesses, more from your medicines. And there are so many doctors
that you can escape death but you cannot escape the doctors – they will
kill you in the end. Whatsoever you do they will kill you. Fifty percent
of diseases can simply disappear from the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>Hypnosis is a great force, but with every force there is danger – it
can be misused. But just because a force can be misused you need not go
against it... because anything can be misused, and if it can be misused
that shows it can be used also. So become more vulnerable, become more
suggestible, become more available to hypnosis. That means you will
become more intelligent, more cooperative, more trusting.</p><p><br></p><p>Enough for today.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

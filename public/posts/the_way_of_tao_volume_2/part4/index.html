IT DOES ALL, AND YET DOES NOT BOAST OF IT.\nIT PRESIDES OVER ALL, AND YET DOES NOT CONTROL THEM. THIS IS WHAT IS CALLED THE MYSTERIOUS QUALITY OF THE TAO.\nAll that is subtle in existence is invisible. Things are visible according to their grossness. That which is visible is superficial; that which is invisible is profound and deep. Therefore, those who set out to seek God make a fundamental error. The very word “Ishwara” for God is irrelevant and absurd. That which can be seen is not Ishwara; that which is seen, by dint of the very fact that it can be seen, is not God. What the eyes see is matter, what the hands feel is matter, and that which the mind knows – that too is matter.\nActually, whatever we know develops a boundary, a form, a structure. That which forever remains beyond all our knowing, that which we can never touch or never see no matter how much we want to – and yet, whose existence we cannot deny – that is God (Paramatman).\nThere are three things. One is the visible world that consists of all that we see and that registers on our senses. To be visible means to be evident before our eyes. That only we consider to be true\nand authentic. That which we cannot see, can touch, it is only natural that our mind should deny its existence. This is the second category.\nIf there were only these two categories of existence, then God would have no place in the world the atman could not be and religion would be of no use. Then love also would not be possible and all prayers would be false. But there is a third category. We have talked of the first two: the first is the visible world that we can see, touch and feel with our senses; and the second is the invisible world which we cannot experience with our senses – we cannot see it, nor touch it, nor understand it. Now there is a third classification of existence which we also cannot see, nor touch nor understand, and yet whose existence we cannot deny. This third category is God himself. Lao Tzu refers to it as Tao. Tao means religion Tao means the law, Tao means the supreme rule, the ultimate reality. This third Lao Tzu refers to as Tao. Whether we say Ishwara or atman or truth it makes no difference because all names are given by man.\nBuddha has referred to this category as nirvana, the void. Those who lack understanding interpret his statement to mean that Buddha denied the existence of God. If that is what Buddha meant, there would have been no need for him to refer to it as shunya (void). Buddha has not denied the existence of God, but he refers to Him as the void.\nWhy did Buddha choose this word to describe the ultimate reality? Because both aspects of existence are contained in the void. The void is, and also is not. It exists as if it did not exist. Its presence is not present. It does not exist in a gross form, and therefore those who try to grasp it in a gross way never attain it. Those who endeavour to know it in the same manner as they know other objects can never know it. We have to change our very method of knowing.\nLet us try to understand this. I say that there is love for you in my heart. But you cannot understand my love by dissecting my heart. If you try, you will come to the conclusion that I told a lie because nowhere will you find love within me. Love is not matter that can be examined in a laboratory. What the scientist will find will be things that love may have no knowledge of. He will come across the various organs of the body, the flesh, the bones and even the heart, but nowhere can he point and say, “Here is love.” Then the scientist is bound to declare that there is nothing like love. Then only two things are possible: either this man is purposely lying or he is under an illusion.\nBut if the scientist is asked, “Granted that this man was under some illusion, have you been able to locate this illusion within him?” he has no answer to this. He cannot find the illusion anywhere on his table. Or, if the man was telling a lie, the lie should be hidden some where within him.\nActually, the scientist should say that the man who said he was in love is not there at all, because he cannot he found anywhere within the body. What comes within our grasp of understanding is unable to speak. But this the scientist will not say because he himself can speak.\nSo we shall have to say that love exists, but not as an object. It has a different dimension of existence. Love exists, but not like matter. And remember, the more invisible the love, the deeper it is. The more it is expressed, the more base it becomes. When someone declares his love, he debases it, because even this much brings love within the grasp of senses. If nothing else. the ears hear the declaration.\nTherefore, a person like Buddha would never say to anyone that he loves him. To say it is to destroy the love. If love is there, there is no need to express it even this much. If love is, it will be experienced. If it cannot be experienced without expression, there is no way to experience it.\nHave you ever experienced a love that was never spoken, that was never expressed; where the lover never touched your hand or took you in his embrace, where the lover made no effort to reveal his love? And yet, you felt as if you have been refreshed by the waters of the Ganges, or that suddenly flowers seem to have showered on you and some distant music from unknown quarters begins to play within you. No fingers touch the strings of the veena, and yet its mellow music enthralls your very being. No one is near, and yet someone seems to have gone deep within, to the very core of your being. If you have experienced such a love, it will be easy for you to understand what Lao Tzu says, for God’s nature is like love.\nUnfortunately we do not know love. And one who does not know love can never know God, because love is the way of the supreme power.\nThe first sutra of Lao Tzu is: God gives birth to everything and nourishes it also. And yet, He claims no ownership over it. Man’s consciousness has lifted its hands to heavens infinite times, man has bowed low in reverence and worshipped Him, his soul has cried out to Him, proclaimed faith in Him, even experienced His presence, but there has never ever been any response to his utterances. Man has called himself the son of God. Man hails God as his creator, his preserver, but God never confirms. He never says, “I am your creator, your preserver.” Unproclaimed, silent is His Being.\nUnderstand this a little. He who makes a claim, by his very action forfeits his rights. If a father has to tell his son that he is his father, if a lover has to make it known to his beloved that he is the lover, if a guru has to announce to his disciples that he is the guru, the genuineness is destroyed. The day the guru demands respect from his disciple, he should know that his gurudom is either lost or non-existent. It needs to be proclaimed. He who is revered with instinctive spontaneity is a guru. He who has to make known his gurudom, knows well, within himself, that he is not a guru.\nWhen I was in the university, a question was asked during a conference : “Why doesn’t the student of today respect his teacher?” I replied, “Where is the teacher?” Guru means, one who is invariably respected, who cannot but be respected. He does not demand respect; rather, respect flows towards him as the waters of the river flow to the sea. If the sea questions why the rivers do not flow into it, we shall have to inform the sea that it is under an illusion and that it is no more than a pond or a lake. The very meaning of the ocean is that rivers flow into it; that rivers have no other option but to flow towards it. The river exists only to flow into the sea. If it does not flow into the sea it cannot be a river. The ocean does not have to attract the attention of the rivers towards itself. Its being is enough.\nRespect and reverence flow towards the guru: love flows towards love. But if a claim is being sought, it proves the claimant is absent.\nThis may seem paradoxical, but it is so. Whenever you claim that you love, search within. You will not find even a trace of love, because love is claim enough unto itself. Its very being is enough to prove it. All other claims are impotent declarations of what is not within. God does not claim, for God is the claimant.\nThere was an atheist in the West by the name of Diderot. In one of his meetings, he held up his watch and said, “If God is, let him give me a small proof of His existence. Let Him stop my watch ticking right now. You say God is the creator and the destroyer of this world. Let him stop this man-made watch and prove His presence. Then I promise to worship Him forever.” All the theists that were present in the crowd looked up to the skies and began to pray, “O Lord, by your grace, the lame can climb mountains, the blind begin to see, the dead come to life! What can you not do? And this is a trifling matter. Stop this watch and prove yourself to the infidels!” But the watch did not stop.\nDiderot won, not because his atheism was right but because the theism of the theists was incorrect. They were coaxing God to enter into competition with Diderot. They were urging Him not to lose this opportunity to prove himself. If, however? Diderot was really wise, or if the theists were really wise, they would have understood.\nMy feeling is that if God also had entered into the competition that day, He would have become inauthentic forever and ever. Had the watch stopped, to prove His authenticity, God would have debased himself. Actually, claims always arise from the low, the inferior. If God could not be indifferent to one single Diderot, He would have lost all claim to Godhood.\nDiderot went home exulting in his victory. All his life he remained perfectly convinced of his understanding because if God could not give even such a slight indication of His existence? how could He exist?\nWe need proofs to demonstrate the existence of anything. Actually, that which is, needs and gives no proof. We seek proof only when we doubt the authenticity of a thing. Those who have been the greatest believers in God, have never troubled to prove His existence. Those who have given proofs of His? existence were not theists. Those who made the existence of God a syllogism for their arguments and lengthy, logical calculations cannot have been theists. Those who try to persuade themselves with proofs of His existence are also atheists. If any proof turns out to be wrong, their God becomes false immediately.\nIf God depends on proofs for His existence, then remember? the proof is greater than God. Tertullian has said, “I believe in you because you have never given any proofs.” This man must have been a perfect theist. He says, “I believe in you because you seem impossible. Whatever way I think, I find no evidence of your being. Therefore, I firmly believe that you are. If your existence depended on my testimony, then I would be greater than you, because then it would be in my hands to give evidence to prove or disprove you. My intelligence would then become the deciding factor on which your existence depended.”\nLao Tzu says, “He is the creator, the preserver, but he is not the acclaimer.” He has never proclaimed His ownership. He is so sure and confident of His ownership that He needs no declarations. Because we are not sure of ownership, we need to proclaim it time and again, even to our own selves. Have you ever noticed that you hardly ever talk of a thing you are sure of?\nVivekananda went to Ramakrishna. He shook him by the arm and declared, “I want to know whether God is.” He had asked this question to others before. Many tried to give him proofs of God’s existence, some with logic, some through the shastras, but Vivekananda was not satisfied because if your God is hidden behind logic, you can be proved wrong. Logic is a double-edged weapon.\nTo Vivekananda’s question, Ramakrishna replied, “Do not waste time in asking useless questions. Tell me if you want to know, to see, to meet Him.” For the first time Vivekananda was facing a man who was so sure of himself that he never offered to prove or to teach. He simply said, “If you want to meet Him, say so”.\nVivekananda commented later on that he had asked this question to others and caused them embarrassment; but in the case of Ramakrishna it was his turn to be disconcerted; because he realised that he himself had not yet decided the issue. It was mere curiosity that he was out to satisfy. One thing, Vivekananda says, was clear from this: that this man’s knowledge depended on nothing outside himself. He knew; his knowledge was pure. There were no reasons why – he knew. And he was so sure and confirmed in this knowledge that he said, “If you want to know, say so.”\nThis question that baffles almost all of mankind was so easy for Ramakrishna – as easy as if someone had asked him about the sun and all he had to do was to take him by the hand and take him out of doors! It is worthless to argue whether the sun is or is not. Step out of the house and there the sun is! Ramakrishna’s speech was so artless, so spontaneous, that it carried the mark of deep and profound knowledge. Where there is complete assurance, there is no claim. If God is not assured within himself; who else can be? Therefore, God has not proclaimed His existence. People say that the Bible is the book of God, that the Koran and the Vedas are books of God, but I say unto you, there is no book of God. All these books belong to men who have had a glimpse of God. God can only write a book if He feels inferior within himself. He would only proclaim himself if He himself was doubtful of His existence. There is no book by God because God has given no statements. Whom would He want to convince of His existence? He is. His ownership is natural because there is no competitor. Ownership has to be declared only when there is the fear of other aspirants.\nA husband tells his wife: “I am your master.” Why? because all around there is rivalry, and any time the ownership can be snatched away. Anyone can be the owner. You proclaim your ownership of a house because if you do not do so in time, others can snatch it away from you. But if God proclaims, to whom should He proclaim?\nTherefore, Lao Tzu says, He does not declare His ownership. Tao, Paramatman or religion make no declarations because His claim is confirmed and natural. He is. He does everything and yet does not boast of being the doer.\nWhenever we do anything, we are motivated by compulsion. This gives rise to the ego. You sleep all night, breathe for twenty-four hours, but you do not boast about it. You do not proclaim from house- tops that you breathed so many times! Mind you, your number of breaths runs into thousands each day. You can boast that you have slept twenty years out of a life of sixty years, but we do not do this for these acts are so natural to us that we do not proclaim to be the doer.\nBut man always boasts. He boasts if he has even one rupee in his pocket. When he has thousands of rupees, he proclaims his riches for sure. Yet he would pay thousands of rupees for one breath. But he never boasts about it. If a dying man were told that he would be given so many breaths if he agreed to give away his wealth, he would most willingly part with it. But it is strange that all his life he proclaimed his paltry wealth and never his precious breath! Breath was natural to him and hence did not need to be proclaimed. Wealth was not his nature. He had to toil in order to attain it, and hence the claim.\nWhere there is effort, there is ego. Where there is no effort there is no ego. If God had to make an effort to make the world, as we do to gain wealth, then ego would bound to be there. But if it is an effortless act on His part – like our breathing – then there is no question of the ego and, hence, of proclamation.\nSo those who know never like to say that God made the world. They prefer to say, “God became the world.” They do not allow even this much distinction: that God made the trees. They say God creates Himself and becomes the trees. The clouds that glide in the skies are not driven by the power of God. Rather it is God himself who glides in the clouds. God does not create man; rather, He himself is born as man.\nUnderstand this a little. An artist paints a picture. No sooner is it made than it becomes separate from the artist. But God is not separate from His creation, because there is no way for Him to stand apart. He is connected with His creation like a dancer with his dance. When a dancer dances, he and his dance are not two separate things; they are one. If he stops, the dance stops. We cannot ask him to go away and leave his dance behind. Therefore, we have depicted God as a dancer in our images of Him: Nataraja. And the reason is only this: that the dance and the dancer are one. God can be understood best as a dancer.\nGod and the universe are one. Whatever happens within the universe happens within the order of His disposition. It is, therefore, that Lao Tzu says, “IT (TAO) DOES EVERYTHING AND YET DOES NOT BOAST OF IT.”\nOnly one whose acts are stamped with force and violence bouts. Do you know of any act of yours that you have performed without the feeling of pride? Know then that that virtuous deed.\nThis may sound difficult because our good deeds also give rise to conceit. The truth is that if there is no conceit, we do not care for virtuous deeds. If I ask you to contribute towards the construction of a temple, you will at once ask where I intend to place a plaque with your name. If I say, “This temple shall bear no plaques,” know for certain that this temple will never be constructed. We do not care for the temple; we care only for the tablet that bears our name. The plaque is significant; the temple secondary. The inscription looks nice only on a temple – and therefore, the building. If no acclaim is forthcoming, we are not prepared to donate.\nThe shastras say, “Give charity and you will be acclaimed in this world for your virtuous deed and reap the reward of it in the next world.” Spend one coin in charity and you gain thousands in heaven.” To get a single coin out of a person, you have to promise him millions in return.\nBut the meaning of a good deed is something very different. A virtuous deed is a deed which does not give rise to arrogance. That act which gives rise to arrogance and conceit is a sin. Therefore, it can be safely said that God has never committed a sin because there is no sign of conceit in any of His actions. To date, He has not once proclaimed that ‘I am’. Therefore, all that He does is virtuous.\nYour actions also can be virtuous, if there is none go consolidating behind them. If an act is performed and nothing is added to your ego, then the act becomes a virtuous deed. That which adds to your ego is a sinful act.\nSo the question is not between a virtuous deed and a sinful deed. The question is of the doer himself. The question should be: how is a deed to be performed? The act must be done, but the sense of being the doer should not be strengthened. Then, it is a virtue.\nEven if the act is not performed and the ego is strengthened by it, it becomes a sin. Action is not necessary. A man may not steal; he only thinks about stealing. A man may not kill; he only thinks about murder. Or, a man may not be fighting in the elections but only thinking about it. Such people climb the steps of ego in their thoughts, which are a substitute for action. It is not everyone who can perform. Action has its own problems, its own difficulties, but everyone has the capacity to dream. All men cannot be kings but they can rule over the kingdoms of their dreams. But an act in your dream also helps to push the ego up a few steps. Even if you are sitting in a chair and dreaming that you have won the elections, this is enough to lift the ego sky-high. The ego is like the mercury in a thermometer. The slightest pleasure you take in your actions and it rises immediately – even when the act itself is not performed.\nBut the opposite can also happen. You do a good deed and there is no pride behind your action. Then, the mercury falls.\n“IT (TAO) DOES ALL, AND YET DOES NOT BOAST OF IT. IT PRESIDES OVER EVERYTHING\nAND YET CONTROLS NOTHING.” This sutra is very subtle. Tao is the all-in-all of everything, yet does not control anything.\nA common question that has been asked throughout the ages is that if God is, and if everything happens according to His will, then why does he allow a thief to steal, or a murderer to kill, or a cheat to deceive? And when the weak is tormented by the strong, why does He merely look on? The question is consistent and deserves recognition. Intelligent people have questioned this time and again. Actually, the biggest doubt in the minds of intelligent people about the existence of God is caused by this question.\nBertrand Russell asks, “If God exists, how can He allow a child to be born blind or crippled or with cancer? If God is, how does this happen? And you say He is the doer of everything!” The hell that we witness today in life makes us doubt whether God really is. If there is a God, doesn’t He deserve to be called Satan, seeing life is as it is? The question is very consistent with the facts: if God is, why is there evil in the world?\nA Muslim friend came to visit me. This was his question too. He said, “The biggest question I feel is that if God is, then why is the world so evil?” He is right, because there can be no relationship between God and evil. How can there be?\nI told him, “Let us remove all evil from the world for a moment. Can you visualize what the world will be like then?” The moment you remove evil, the good also disappears from the scene. Good cannot exist on its own. It is because of evil that good exists. Remove darkness and light disappears together with it. Light exists because of darkness. Remove the cold, and the heat is automatically lost. Heat and cold are different variations of the same thing. If we try to remove death, life too will be lost. If there is no death, how can life be? Or, if there is no life, how can death be?\nThe universe exists with the help of polar opposites. The world’s existence is brought about by the music between opposites. If the opposite is removed, both are removed. Remove the male, and\nthe female is lost. Remove old age, and youth is lost. The young person always wishes to prolong his youth because he does not know that youth and old age are so closely combined that if one is removed, the other is lost. We all wish ugliness to be removed from the world; but if ugliness is lost, beauty will also disappear. If you wish for a world without ugliness, be prepared to face a world where nothing is beautiful.\nI told my friend, “If you wish for a world where evil is banned, good will flee from such a place immediately. Then this world will be a big prison house; because where there is no freedom to do evil, there can be no freedom at all.\nIn fact, the word “freedom” contains the freedom to do evil also. If a man is told that he is free only to be good, what meaning does such a freedom convey? This freedom has no meaning. Rather, it implies bondage. It would be proper to say; you are condemned to be good – not free to be good. When we tell a person he is free to be good, the freedom to be evil enters along with the freedom to be good. God is the totality and yet he does not control anything. This means that God creates, but He creates freedom.\nA man is free to be good and free to be bad – as bad as he wishes – when God is the Lord of everything. This is because true freedom exists only if there is freedom to do what one wishes, be it good or bad. When no such freedom exists, man is not man but a machine which does whatever it is made to do because it is insentient.\nMan is sentient; he possesses consciousness. Consciousness is not possible without freedom. Lao Tzu says; He is the creator, but not the controller. He has not created a prison for us, where He stands guard at the gate.\nPeople like Bertrand Russell say that it is this very reason that creates a doubt about His existence. But I say, it is for this very reason that God is. Where freedom is not, God cannot be. Freedom is the very proof of the existence of God. He is, because we are so completely free. He is! You may compare the existence of God to the example of the ocean and the fish that live in it. The fish are not aware of the ocean but their very existence is because of the ocean. Suicide; our lives become a veritable hell. Then we turn around and say, “Slavery was better, because then we were happy.” Freedom always finds us moving downward.\nWe seek slavery in all kinds of ways. And the ways we seek it are really astounding! Erich Fromm has written a unique book, Escape from Freedom. Fromm says that each man wishes to escape freedom. Wherever he finds freedom, he quickly seeks out slavery and hides himself behind it. This slavery cannot be detected easily because our habit . of serfdom is so old that we cannot discriminate slavery from freedom.\nIf a person sets out to seek truth, he does not directly go out in search of it but begins to turn the pages of the shastras. Little does he know that this is slavery. He wishes to borrow even truth; – he wants someone to give it to him.\nIf a person wants to know truth, he does not set out by himself to discover it; he goes and falls at the feet of a guru saying, “You are my everything. Give me the knowledge of truth. How can I, a sinner, do anything?” He little knows that all his sins are his own doing. A lot of toil and effort is required to\nbecome a sinner. He admits his ability to commit sins by saying he is a sinner. At the same time he says, “How can a sinner do anything to gain knowledge of the truth?” Actually, he is begging to be saved from his freedom. He is requesting this guru to become his jailer so that if tomorrow, he finds himself in hell, he can put the responsibility on the Guru. And if he attains heaven, he can always claim the credit for having chosen this guru. Thus, man clings to the shastras, and to gurus.\nPeople like Hitler, Mao and Stalin are not born accidentally. They are born only when a whole country desires to be enslaved. Each person eagerly wishes for a man who can stand up and say, “I know what is right, Follow me!” – so that they can follow him. They want to be told clearly what to do and what not to do. This is why we pursue politicians and sadhus and mahatmas. And these whom we ask, – they too have asked others. They have no direct knowledge of their own; they too do not know what is right and what is wrong. The fact is, when there are people to inquire, teachers become available.\nWe are eager to place our burden on others. Freedom seems too heavy for our shoulders. It should actually be the other way around: freedom should give us wings to fly in the sky.\nFreedom seems very cumbersome, because we do not know what to do with it. There was a Zen fakir by the name of Nanin. One day he stayed late at his guru’s ashram. He asked his guru to give him a lamp since it was too dark and he had far to go. The guru gave him a lamp but as soon as he began to go down the steps, the guru blew out the flame and extinguished it. Nanin was surprised. “What kind of a joke is this?” he asked.\nThe guru replied, “It never pays to find your path with another’s light. Your own darkness is much better than someone else’s light. Go, seek in your own darkness, so that the lamp within you may become lightened. The more you seek, the more you shall be cleansed. You will fall, you will dash against things, your limbs may break, but you will discover your soul in the bargain. Therefore, I have extinguished the lamp.”\nNanin has written in his memoirs that he was never able to forget this man who had snatched the lamp from his hands and snuffed it out. He was the one who pushed him into darkness and made provisions for the lamp within to burn. “Today,” he says, “when I see the flame burning within, my head bows down in reverence and gratefulness to this man who caused it to be lit.”\nThis is freedom. It is very easy for God to place a light in your hands, but you can only live like worms with the help of such light. You will never fall, never go astray. There will be no hell; you will go straight to heaven. But the heaven that is obtained with the help of another is worse than hell, because such a heaven is a bondage. The good fortune that is not entirely one’s own, that has not been sought and attained and experienced by one’s own effort is worse than misfortune. Therefore Lao Tzu says: “Tao creates everything but controls nothing. It gives no instructions. It has given us the strength and the means to walk but it does not say,”Walk like this.” The power to walk belongs to Tao; the space, the path, the darkness, the light, the very person who walks is Tao; and yet, Tao does not command: “go to the right, go to the left.”\nTao gives us life, but it makes freedom the very basis of life. This freedom can become the agony of life or the benevolence of life; the choice is entirely ours. This freedom can cause that which lies hidden within to be revealed. This freedom can also be utilised to create our own darkness, our own\nnether world where we can rot and decay and be destroyed. One thing is certain however: that there is perfect freedom in the world. This perfect freedom is the unacclaimed declaration of the existence of God. This is His silent declaration of “I am”.\nBut we are totally unaware of this freedom. We are afraid, because freedom means responsibility. It means that I am the only person responsible for all my actions. If I find myself in hell, I have no one to blame but myself.\nThis responsibility perplexes and confuses us, so we try to shove it on to each other. The husband puts the responsibility on the wife, the wife on the husband, and thus both absolve themselves, taking the other to be accountable. They are not at all conscious of the game they play.\nEric Berne has written a book The Games the People Play. In this book he describes almost all the games that human beings play with each other. This act of throwing responsibility on each other is also a game. The funny part is that the one on whom we place the responsibility, places the same responsibility on us. He who cannot be responsible for himself how can he be expected to shoulder the responsibility of others?\nUnfortunately, neither he nor you are aware of the fact that you have placed your responsibility on each other. And so, we blame each other throughout life, without knowing that we both are beggars who are holding our begging bowls before each other. Each begs of the other, and neither can give!\nFreedom is frightening, so we try to look for some kind of slavery. Our so-called God [not the Tao that Lao Tzu speaks of] is also a bondage. We place the onus on Him. We say, “We are in your hands. Take care of us!” Therefore, when a man is happy, he never thinks of God; but when he is unhappy, he always thinks of God. He does not want to bear the responsibility for his own unhappiness. He is only prepared to be responsible for his good fortune. He likes to feel and believe it was entirely because of him. But when bad days befall him, he looks up to heaven and cries, “How can I suffer so when you are there? Of what use is your being if I suffer so? Either banish my woes and give me proof of you existence or I shall not believe in you.”\nA man came to me and said, “I have complete faith in God. I prayed to Him that if my son did not get a job within fifteen days I would never have faith in Him. And, within fifteen days, my son got a job!”\nI told him, “God has struck a bad bargain with you. Do not ever test Him again in this way or else you will be disappointed.\nHe was adamant in his belief. He said, “I am now convinced that He is!”\nI said to him, “This very conviction will land you and your God in trouble one day. Your son getting a job is a mere coincidence. Do not pride yourself that God took pains to get your son a job. This way, you prove yourself and your son to be more significant than God. Even his job is more important than God; God has proven himself to be your servant. Do not ask Him for such things again. Such coincidences are never repeated.\nAfter two months, the gentleman returned. He said, “What kind of words have you uttered? Everything is confused now. Four times I tried to attain God’s favour, and four times He has failed me. God has turned His back on me!”\nI told him, “God has not turned his back on you. Neither does He turn His face towards you. He has no face and no back, nor is your prayer, your insistence, your appeal, of any consequence. What is precious and meaningful is your own self.”\nYour value, your meaningfulness, depends upon the extent to which you make creative use of your freedom. Your value depends upon the right use you make of your freedom. The very meaning of Sadhana is this: The creative use of your freedom.\nSadhana means the creative use of your freedom. The worldly man is one who uses his freedom destructively. He is leading to his own destruction. He makes his freedom the obstruction to his own elan vital and is instrumental in creating his own gallows.\nWe do not remember God in happiness, but we remember Him in our unhappiness because then we want to shove off the responsibility from our shoulders. Russell has written, “I will only believe that God really is when there is no sorrow on earth.” Russell is right as far as theism goes. Our theism will fade if there is no sorrow on earth. Think a while: Will anyone remember God if there is no sorrow on earth? Will the temple bells ring? will candles burn in churches then? Will the call of the muezzin fill the morning air? These prayers, these calls, this worship, these oblations of fire – through all these, our sorrow cries. And the absurdity of it all is that neither temples nor mosques can eradicate our sorrows, because it is we who create them and we alone can destroy them. Sorrow is the misuse we make of our freedom. But it is this freedom that we want to save ourselves from.\nReally, would the thought of God ever have entered our mind if there was no sorrow on earth? How could it arise? God is like medicine for an illness. If there is no illness, who but a madman would think of taking medicine? God is like a medicine to us. We use Him to cure our ills. When there is sorrow, we think the medicine of His name; when there is happiness, we throw the bottle of this medicine in the dustbin.\nWe think of Him in sorrow only, because we want to place the responsibility for our ills on His shoulders. But you cannot place any responsibility on God’s shoulders because God does not bind you. You are free, independent. No one is there in this world who is a greater advocate of freedom than God.\nThe freedom He confers on His creation is so profound that we see so much dissimilarity around us.\nThe socialist and the communist, who always criticize God always put forth this argument: that if there is a God, then why all this inequality? Their argument appears to be correct on the face of it because they do not take the trouble to think. Remember, however, that freedom and equality are opposite conditions. If you desire equality, you cannot have freedom; if you desire freedom you cannot have equality. All people can be made equal, but then all will have to be slaves. Equality can only exist in prison. Even in a prison, if there is some laxity, inequality creeps in. Utmost strictness is required to maintain equality.\nComplete equality is possible only in complete subservience. Therefore, if communism succeeds, the whole world will be one big prison. If communism does not succeed completely, it cannot be communism.\nFreedom means that each person has the freedom to be what he wishes to be. Then, inequality is bound to be there. Then inequality is inevitable. If equality is to be maintained, each man will have to be forcibly made to conform to the accepted level of equality.\nAnother interesting development that follows such equality is that the level of consciousness falls according to the degree of equality in a society. The greater the equality, the lower will be the plane of consciousness. Supposing there is a class of thirty pupils. The boy who is the thirteenth in the class cannot be made to attain the first grade; but in order to maintain equality, the first boy can be forcibly constrained to go down to the level of the thirteenth. Actual equality can only be maintained at the level because the lowest can never be pulled up to the highest point, whereas the highest can be obstructed and made to go down. Likewise, it is not easy to bring all the patients in a hospital back to good health, but it is very easy to make healthy people sick. To pull back is always easier; to rise up is always difficult. Therefore, the greater the equality, the lower will be the plane of intelligence; and the greater the freedom, the greater the possibility of intelligence touching the peaks of consciousness.\nRemember, freedom means that he who wants to reach the peak will reach, and he who does not want to reach will not reach. He is free to remain where he was if he so wishes, and he is free to undertake the long journey – again, if he so wishes. So to people like Marx who deny the presence of God on the grounds of inequality, I say that this is one of the many proofs of the existence of God: that there in so much inequality and disparity in the world because of the complete freedom He has granted us.\nPeople invariably invoice equality and freedom in one breath. Not only this, in France they went a step further and shouted the slogan: “Justice, Freedom, Equality!” This is complete insanity, but we are not aware of it because we are so enchanted by the trickery of words. We never try to investigate deeply, but are simply carried away by the magic of words. If there is equality, there cannot be freedom; and if there is freedom, equality is impossible. And if you want justice, you shall have to choose between the two.\nThen also, if you opt for freedom, your justice will be entirely different; and if you opt for equality, your justice will be entirely different. If you choose equality, then an attempt to be different will be termed a crime. If you choose freedom, this very attempt would be deemed a just and rightful act. If you choose equality, it will be lawful to keep each man limited; and if you choose freedom it will be considered lawful to encourage a person to be different. It will be unjust and unlawful to hinder or obstruct a person from becoming unusual and different.\nAll this is very difficult to deal with. Freedom and equality are very important problems.\nSo, Marx denied God. He had very little to do with God. Rather, he had no use for Him. But one thing was clear to him: If God exists, freedom cannot be destroyed. Then inequality is bound to remain. So if inequality is to be destroyed, we shall have to destroy the very philosophy of the existence of God. Thus it is not without reason that Communism is atheistic. A person cannot be a communist and still believe in God. He has to be an atheist, because the very meaning of God is freedom – no control.\nWhat Lao Tzu said dates back 2500 years before Marx. Independence and freedom can only be in absence of control. Only where there is freedom is there the possibility of development. But then,\nthe responsibility rests with us. If we wish to avoid it, we will have to find some means of bondage and slavery. If we do not make God or guru our master, we shall make the state our master. It makes no difference. Let he who wills, throw the reins round our necks. We are ready to follow. We are incapable of walking ourselves; we need someone to prod us, to goad us on. Then we are assured and feel confident. We feel there is no need for anxiety; we cannot go wrong. But remember, this is the biggest mistake Whatever we do after surrendering our freedom is an error, a sin, a crime.\nLao Tzu says, “THIS IS THE MOST MYSTERIOUS QUALITY OF TAO.” That is so. It is, and yet it is not the cause of anyone’s bondage. Think this over: If God comes and stands before you here and now you shall no longer be free. Why? Because His very presence will create inferiority in you. You will be thrown into confusion; all your misdeeds will stare you in the face.\nThe priests explain to people, “He has a thousand eyes. He sees you from everywhere.” This is only a trick to deter people from stealing. God has no eyes. By this I do not mean He is blind. He needs no eyes to see us. But the priest must admonish, “His eyes are always on you, wherever you are!” This is just to create the fear of God with you. If a person really believes this, it will be impossible for him to commit a sin! How can he dream of committing a sin when a thousand eyes, like searchlights, are always focussed on him!\nBut he who is thus saved from sin is merely succumbing to fear. The sin is committed twice over. The theft is committed and the fear-complex haunts the person.\nI have read about a Catholic nun who used to bathe with her clothes on. When other nuns asked her why she did this, she said, “Don’t you know that God is everywhere? He is even in the bathroom!” But this poor woman was not told that one who can see through the bathroom can also see through her clothes. If God is everywhere, we can not remove our clothes anywhere, for wherever we do so, He is bound to be looking.\nThese are nothing but ways of arousing fear. Man does not become good this way; he only becomes fearful. A fearful man is never a good man. Only a fearless man can be a good man. Priests of all religions, however, have made man conscious of His presence everywhere – although God is totally non-present. This too is a part of His total freedom. If He were present, we could not even exist, let alone be free. His presence in itself would have snatched away our freedom, because then, how could we commit violence? All this then becomes impossible. So His very absence is an inevitable part of His freedom. He is as if he is not. The class-room is full, but the teacher is missing. Then, each child does what he feels like doing. Each one is free to do what he likes. It is His profound and mysterious, distinctive quality that He is and yet is absent. He is, but He is not present. He is everywhere, – not an inch of space is without Him, not a pore of the body, not a simple beat of the heart, not a particle of matter is without Him – and yet, He is not present. His non-presence is so complete that people question His existence.\nThis is His mysterious quality: that He is everywhere and yet is so unobtrusive that we doubt His existence. We can turn round and ask, “Does He exist? And if so, where?” We are not convinced unless we can see Him, because if He was, we could surely see Him.\nEven one who says he has seen Him is completely helpless when asked to show Him. He is dismissed as mad, of unsound mind. There are thousands who swear that there is no God because\nHe cannot be seen, so when some one comes along who claims he has seen Him, he is singled out from the crowd, and stands like a lone figure against the crowd who revile him. Buddha, Christ, Mahavira, Mohammed, stood alone against the whole world. In fact, there have not been more solitary figures than them in the history of this world. They lived surrounded by crowds and yet they were alone.\nMahavira was always surrounded by a crowd, but he was alone within himself because not a single person understood or believed what he said. Lao Tzu also found himself surrounded by thousands of people, yet he was alone. Those who heard him doubted his words because they could not see what he saw. Yet these were lovable persons. Their personality was magnetic.\nWe doubt the words of these people and yet we cannot help but follow them. Their elan vital is filled with a mysterious magnet that draws us towards them. Their eyes are hypnotic. Once they catch you, they do not leave you. We do not have the courage to accept what they say, and time and again we wish to run away from them. We try to criticize them, we try to escape from them, and yet there is something in them that invariably draws us towards them. But these are solitary people because they talk of Him whom they find present but who is absolutely non-present for us.\nRamakrishna told Vivekananda. “I have come to know that you have not eaten for days. Why don’t you go inside the temple and tell Mother about it, you foolish fellow? Go and ask Her for what you want.”\nVivekananda was an intellectual who took nothing for granted and when Ramakrishna talked like this he wondered, “Where’s the mother? Who is this mother?” But Ramakrishna spoke with such faith and conviction that he did not dare to raise these questions that arose in his mind.\nHis father had died, leaving a debt to be cleared. He found it impossible to clear it. There was not enough food for two in the house, so everyday he pretended he was invited out so that his mother would eat. He would return home in the evening and talk about how much he had enjoyed the meal so that his mother would be assured that he had eaten. Under such conditions, Ramakrishna’s words seemed to be the words of a madman. Which mother was he talking about? He could not believe.\nRamakrishna had just become the priest of the temple when the trustees filed a suit against him. On the eighth day, he was called before the committee and charged with tasting the food before it was offered in worship. To this, Ramakrishna replied, “When my mother used to feed me, she always tasted the food first. How can I offer my Divine Mother what has not been tasted and tested? How can I be sure it is fit to be put before Her?”\nThe trustees were filled with despair. What mother was he talking about? The temple was theirs, the idol was one they had erected. Surely this man was mad! He was a worker employed by them for eighteen rupees a month, they had spent lakhs on constructing this temple, and this man had the temerity to say he would rather leave the job than offer untasted food to his mother! He insisted on smelling the flowers first before offering them to Her, because how could flowers be offered to the mother that bore no fragrance? The members of the Board looked at each other. What was this man saying? It was unbelievable. And yet when they looked into his eyes, they felt that they would have to believe what he said. Perhaps he could see what they could not!\nThis man is alone. And the cause for his solitude is this mysterious qualification of God: that He is, but He is as if He is not. So only those who discover the art of seeing Him in His absence – they alone can see Him. Those who develop the art of seeing without the eyes, they alone can see Him. Those who embrace Him without the use of hands, they alone can embrace Him. But unfortunately, neither the theist nor the atheist believes in this mysterious qualification of God. Understand this a little. The atheist says, “Leave all this nonsense! What is not, is not. Where is the need for all these deliberations? Go straight to the point. If He is not, He is not; if He is, He is.” An atheist’s logic is straight and simple. He believes in mathematics and straight forward calculations. He says, “Why go into all this ‘as if He is not’ and such stuff? Why not say directly: He is not. Why go into a long fruitless debate? If He is, He should prove His presence. Let Him come before us and we shall accept His existence.”\nThe theist’s trouble is the same. He also is not yet able to grasp the ‘as if’. He too cannot understand that God is as if He is not. Then he begins to invent the devices we all know. One invention of his is an image, a symbol, to make it possible for us to understand this mysterious qualification. He carves an image. Then he forgets God and drops all talk of him. He concentrates on this image now; he bows at its feet. The image is at least a concrete thing he can catch hold of. Then he makes an image of Buddha, Rama or Krishna and prays to it:\n“I am not concerned with the formless Brahma that may or may not be. You are enough for me.”\nBut this is also an atheistic attitude. He cannot defeat the atheism’s argument so he says, “There may be no Paramatman but Rama is, Krishna is.” Then he weaves stories of miracles around and about Rama and Krishna to answer the atheist’s questions: “When a thorn pricks Rama, his foot bleeds. If you slay Mahavira, he dies. Then, they are just ordinary human beings.” So the theist has to invent stories of miracles in counter-argument. He has to say: “Slay Mahavira. The sword will break but Mahavira will remain unaffected. Kill Jesus. You may think he is dead, but he rises again the next day. He is resurrected; he cannot die.” All this is an outcome of our ignorance, because we do not understand the mysterious characteristic of God.\nA friend came yesterday. He is an intelligent person and has great regard for me. He told me, “Why do you not perform some miracle like Sai Baba? Thousands will flock to you.” What use are these thousands of people? What shall I do with them? They come not because of Sai Baba but because of the miracles. If even one came for the sake of Sai Baba it would be more fruitful.\nOne who comes for miracles is not a theist. A theist is one who says, “Everything in this world is a miracle. There is nothing that is not a miracle A seed turns into a tree; clouds move in the sky; the sun comes out, there are stars; there are birds and animals; there is man – everything is a miracle!” He who sees no miracle in all this is impressed by the ash that comes out of the hands of a miracle-man. That the sun comes out is no miracle to this blind man, but a little ash drops from this man’s hand and he is impressed!\nThe intelligence that believes in this ash is not the intelligence that can go God-ward. Lakhs of people are bound to gather, but this crowd will be the crowd that gathers to watch a magic show. It has nothing to do with religion.\nThe stories woven around Mahavira, Christ or Rama are downright false but the devotee, out of sheer frustration invents them. Otherwise his God does not look distinctive from the rest of mankind.\nSo he says, “When Mohammed walked, even on the sunniest day a cloud moved along with him. The devotee has to say all this because his logic is the same as the atheist’s; he has the same intelligence.\nOne who sets out to look for miracles does not have the heart of a devotee. Is there anything in this world that is not a miracle? Show me a single thing that is not a miracle! This whole world is a miracle!\nIs it not a miracle that you are? There is no reason why you should be. The world would have no complaint if you were not. But you are – a complete living entity. It never occurs to us that there is no reason why we should exist. The world would have got on just as well without us. Yet we are! We do not know who creates us; we do not know who destroys us, who brings us into existence, who takes us out of it. We do not know. Is this not a great miracle that is taking place every moment of our existence? And here are we flocking to see a man who takes a little ash out of his hands! Lack of intelligence makes such things appear like miracles. If man is intelligent, the whole world appears to be a miracle.\nOtherwise, we have to invent devices to prove that Rama is God, Krishna is God. I do not say they are not. What I mean to say is that everything on this earth is God. Everything here is divine. There is nothing on this earth which is not God. Therefore, there is no need to prove that Rama is God, that Krishna is God. When every thing is God, Rama is bound to be God also. On this earth, existence itself is God. But we do not accept a simple, ordinary man to be God, so we devise ways and means to accept him as God. We place these before us as an ideal and forget all about the distinctive speciality of God. We have torn the mystery of God apart from our consciousness. We have raised our own gods, our Tirthankaras, our avataras, and we go around and around these, because these are what our intellect can grasp, whereas Lao Tzu’s mysterious quality of the Tao is beyond our understanding. Remember however, that until such time as the mysterious quality of the Tao comes within your understanding you have not entered the gates of religion. The day you gather courage and attain the ability to understand this you shall have your first glimpse of the temple of God, not before that. All other things are home-made stuff. All the avataras and Tirthankaras are your own creations. If you want to enter into God, you have to remember this mysterious quality of the Tao always.\nHe is present as if He is not. He is absent, and yet He is present. If this is constantly remembered, if it pervades every breath you take, the revelations of religion will begin in your Life, and the screen of religion will begin to rise, to reveal the glory that is existence.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"10082","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_way_of_tao_volume_2/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_way_of_tao_volume_2/>The Way of Tao, Volume 2</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">4 Tao\'s unpresent presence</h1><div class=post-meta>48 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;10082 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Way_of_Tao_Volume_2/part4.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

IT DOES ALL, AND
YET DOES NOT BOAST OF IT.</p><p>IT PRESIDES OVER ALL, AND YET DOES NOT CONTROL THEM. THIS IS WHAT IS
CALLED THE MYSTERIOUS QUALITY OF THE TAO.</p><p>All that is subtle in existence is invisible. Things are visible
according to their grossness. That which is visible is superficial; that
which is invisible is profound and deep. Therefore, those who set out to
seek God make a fundamental error. The very word “Ishwara” for God is
irrelevant and absurd. That which can be seen is not Ishwara; that which
is seen, by dint of the very fact that it can be seen, is not God. What
the eyes see is matter, what the hands feel is matter, and that which
the mind knows – that too is matter.</p><p><br></p><p>Actually, whatever we know develops a boundary, a form, a structure.
That which forever remains beyond all our knowing, that which we can
never touch or never see no matter how much we want to – and yet, whose
existence we cannot deny – that is God (Paramatman).</p><p><br></p><p>There are three things. One is the visible world that consists of all
that we see and that registers on our senses. To be visible means to be
evident before our eyes. That only we consider to be true</p><p>and authentic. That which we cannot see, can touch, it is only
natural that our mind should deny its existence. This is the second
category.</p><p><br></p><p>If there were only these two categories of existence, then God would
have no place in the world the atman could not be and religion would be
of no use. Then love also would not be possible and all prayers would be
false. But there is a third category. We have talked of the first two:
the first is the visible world that we can see, touch and feel with our
senses; and the second is the invisible world which we cannot experience
with our senses – we cannot see it, nor touch it, nor understand it. Now
there is a third classification of existence which we also cannot see,
nor touch nor understand, and yet whose existence we cannot deny. This
third category is God himself. Lao Tzu refers to it as Tao. Tao means
religion Tao means the law, Tao means the supreme rule, the ultimate
reality. This third Lao Tzu refers to as Tao. Whether we say Ishwara or
atman or truth it makes no difference because all names are given by
man.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha has referred to this category as nirvana, the void. Those who
lack understanding interpret his statement to mean that Buddha denied
the existence of God. If that is what Buddha meant, there would have
been no need for him to refer to it as shunya (void). Buddha has not
denied the existence of God, but he refers to Him as the void.</p><p><br></p><p>Why did Buddha choose this word to describe the ultimate reality?
Because both aspects of existence are contained in the void. The void
is, and also is not. It exists as if it did not exist. Its presence is
not present. It does not exist in a gross form, and therefore those who
try to grasp it in a gross way never attain it. Those who endeavour to
know it in the same manner as they know other objects can never know it.
We have to change our very method of knowing.</p><p><br></p><p>Let us try to understand this. I say that there is love for you in my
heart. But you cannot understand my love by dissecting my heart. If you
try, you will come to the conclusion that I told a lie because nowhere
will you find love within me. Love is not matter that can be examined in
a laboratory. What the scientist will find will be things that love may
have no knowledge of. He will come across the various organs of the
body, the flesh, the bones and even the heart, but nowhere can he point
and say, “Here is love.” Then the scientist is bound to declare that
there is nothing like love. Then only two things are possible: either
this man is purposely lying or he is under an illusion.</p><p><br></p><p>But if the scientist is asked, “Granted that this man was under some
illusion, have you been able to locate this illusion within him?” he has
no answer to this. He cannot find the illusion anywhere on his table.
Or, if the man was telling a lie, the lie should be hidden some where
within him.</p><p><br></p><p>Actually, the scientist should say that the man who said he was in
love is not there at all, because he cannot he found anywhere within the
body. What comes within our grasp of understanding is unable to speak.
But this the scientist will not say because he himself can speak.</p><p><br></p><p>So we shall have to say that love exists, but not as an object. It
has a different dimension of existence. Love exists, but not like
matter. And remember, the more invisible the love, the deeper it is. The
more it is expressed, the more base it becomes. When someone declares
his love, he debases it, because even this much brings love within the
grasp of senses. If nothing else. the ears hear the declaration.</p><p>Therefore, a person like Buddha would never say to anyone that he
loves him. To say it is to destroy the love. If love is there, there is
no need to express it even this much. If love is, it will be
experienced. If it cannot be experienced without expression, there is no
way to experience it.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever experienced a love that was never spoken, that was
never expressed; where the lover never touched your hand or took you in
his embrace, where the lover made no effort to reveal his love? And yet,
you felt as if you have been refreshed by the waters of the Ganges, or
that suddenly flowers seem to have showered on you and some distant
music from unknown quarters begins to play within you. No fingers touch
the strings of the veena, and yet its mellow music enthralls your very
being. No one is near, and yet someone seems to have gone deep within,
to the very core of your being. If you have experienced such a love, it
will be easy for you to understand what Lao Tzu says, for God’s nature
is like love.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately we do not know love. And one who does not know love can
never know God, because love is the way of the supreme power.</p><p><br></p><p>The first sutra of Lao Tzu is: God gives birth to everything and
nourishes it also. And yet, He claims no ownership over it. Man’s
consciousness has lifted its hands to heavens infinite times, man has
bowed low in reverence and worshipped Him, his soul has cried out to
Him, proclaimed faith in Him, even experienced His presence, but there
has never ever been any response to his utterances. Man has called
himself the son of God. Man hails God as his creator, his preserver, but
God never confirms. He never says, “I am your creator, your preserver.”
Unproclaimed, silent is His Being.</p><p><br></p><p>Understand this a little. He who makes a claim, by his very action
forfeits his rights. If a father has to tell his son that he is his
father, if a lover has to make it known to his beloved that he is the
lover, if a guru has to announce to his disciples that he is the guru,
the genuineness is destroyed. The day the guru demands respect from his
disciple, he should know that his gurudom is either lost or
non-existent. It needs to be proclaimed. He who is revered with
instinctive spontaneity is a guru. He who has to make known his gurudom,
knows well, within himself, that he is not a guru.</p><p><br></p><p>When I was in the university, a question was asked during a
conference : “Why doesn’t the student of today respect his teacher?” I
replied, “Where is the teacher?” Guru means, one who is invariably
respected, who cannot but be respected. He does not demand respect;
rather, respect flows towards him as the waters of the river flow to the
sea. If the sea questions why the rivers do not flow into it, we shall
have to inform the sea that it is under an illusion and that it is no
more than a pond or a lake. The very meaning of the ocean is that rivers
flow into it; that rivers have no other option but to flow towards it.
The river exists only to flow into the sea. If it does not flow into the
sea it cannot be a river. The ocean does not have to attract the
attention of the rivers towards itself. Its being is enough.</p><p><br></p><p>Respect and reverence flow towards the guru: love flows towards love.
But if a claim is being sought, it proves the claimant is absent.</p><p><br></p><p>This may seem paradoxical, but it is so. Whenever you claim that you
love, search within. You will not find even a trace of love, because
love is claim enough unto itself. Its very being is enough to prove it.
All other claims are impotent declarations of what is not within. God
does not claim, for God is the claimant.</p><p>There was an atheist in the West by the name of Diderot. In one of
his meetings, he held up his watch and said, “If God is, let him give me
a small proof of His existence. Let Him stop my watch ticking right now.
You say God is the creator and the destroyer of this world. Let him stop
this man-made watch and prove His presence. Then I promise to worship
Him forever.” All the theists that were present in the crowd looked up
to the skies and began to pray, “O Lord, by your grace, the lame can
climb mountains, the blind begin to see, the dead come to life! What can
you not do? And this is a trifling matter. Stop this watch and prove
yourself to the infidels!” But the watch did not stop.</p><p><br></p><p>Diderot won, not because his atheism was right but because the theism
of the theists was incorrect. They were coaxing God to enter into
competition with Diderot. They were urging Him not to lose this
opportunity to prove himself. If, however? Diderot was really wise, or
if the theists were really wise, they would have understood.</p><p><br></p><p>My feeling is that if God also had entered into the competition that
day, He would have become inauthentic forever and ever. Had the watch
stopped, to prove His authenticity, God would have debased himself.
Actually, claims always arise from the low, the inferior. If God could
not be indifferent to one single Diderot, He would have lost all claim
to Godhood.</p><p><br></p><p>Diderot went home exulting in his victory. All his life he remained
perfectly convinced of his understanding because if God could not give
even such a slight indication of His existence? how could He exist?</p><p><br></p><p>We need proofs to demonstrate the existence of anything. Actually,
that which is, needs and gives no proof. We seek proof only when we
doubt the authenticity of a thing. Those who have been the greatest
believers in God, have never troubled to prove His existence. Those who
have given proofs of His? existence were not theists. Those who made the
existence of God a syllogism for their arguments and lengthy, logical
calculations cannot have been theists. Those who try to persuade
themselves with proofs of His existence are also atheists. If any proof
turns out to be wrong, their God becomes false immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>If God depends on proofs for His existence, then remember? the proof
is greater than God. Tertullian has said, “I believe in you because you
have never given any proofs.” This man must have been a perfect theist.
He says, “I believe in you because you seem impossible. Whatever way I
think, I find no evidence of your being. Therefore, I firmly believe
that you are. If your existence depended on my testimony, then I would
be greater than you, because then it would be in my hands to give
evidence to prove or disprove you. My intelligence would then become the
deciding factor on which your existence depended.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says, “He is the creator, the preserver, but he is not the
acclaimer.” He has never proclaimed His ownership. He is so sure and
confident of His ownership that He needs no declarations. Because we are
not sure of ownership, we need to proclaim it time and again, even to
our own selves. Have you ever noticed that you hardly ever talk of a
thing you are sure of?</p><p><br></p><p>Vivekananda went to Ramakrishna. He shook him by the arm and
declared, “I want to know whether God is.” He had asked this question to
others before. Many tried to give him proofs of God’s existence, some
with logic, some through the shastras, but Vivekananda was not satisfied
because if your God is hidden behind logic, you can be proved wrong.
Logic is a double-edged weapon.</p><p>To Vivekananda’s question, Ramakrishna replied, “Do not waste time in
asking useless questions. Tell me if you want to know, to see, to meet
Him.” For the first time Vivekananda was facing a man who was so sure of
himself that he never offered to prove or to teach. He simply said, “If
you want to meet Him, say so”.</p><p><br></p><p>Vivekananda commented later on that he had asked this question to
others and caused them embarrassment; but in the case of Ramakrishna it
was his turn to be disconcerted; because he realised that he himself had
not yet decided the issue. It was mere curiosity that he was out to
satisfy. One thing, Vivekananda says, was clear from this: that this
man’s knowledge depended on nothing outside himself. He knew; his
knowledge was pure. There were no reasons why – he knew. And he was so
sure and confirmed in this knowledge that he said, “If you want to know,
say so.”</p><p><br></p><p>This question that baffles almost all of mankind was so easy for
Ramakrishna – as easy as if someone had asked him about the sun and all
he had to do was to take him by the hand and take him out of doors! It
is worthless to argue whether the sun is or is not. Step out of the
house and there the sun is! Ramakrishna’s speech was so artless, so
spontaneous, that it carried the mark of deep and profound knowledge.
Where there is complete assurance, there is no claim. If God is not
assured within himself; who else can be? Therefore, God has not
proclaimed His existence. People say that the Bible is the book of God,
that the Koran and the Vedas are books of God, but I say unto you, there
is no book of God. All these books belong to men who have had a glimpse
of God. God can only write a book if He feels inferior within himself.
He would only proclaim himself if He himself was doubtful of His
existence. There is no book by God because God has given no statements.
Whom would He want to convince of His existence? He is. His ownership is
natural because there is no competitor. Ownership has to be declared
only when there is the fear of other aspirants.</p><p><br></p><p>A husband tells his wife: “I am your master.” Why? because all around
there is rivalry, and any time the ownership can be snatched away.
Anyone can be the owner. You proclaim your ownership of a house because
if you do not do so in time, others can snatch it away from you. But if
God proclaims, to whom should He proclaim?</p><p><br></p><p>Therefore, Lao Tzu says, He does not declare His ownership. Tao,
Paramatman or religion make no declarations because His claim is
confirmed and natural. He is. He does everything and yet does not boast
of being the doer.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever we do anything, we are motivated by compulsion. This gives
rise to the ego. You sleep all night, breathe for twenty-four hours, but
you do not boast about it. You do not proclaim from house- tops that you
breathed so many times! Mind you, your number of breaths runs into
thousands each day. You can boast that you have slept twenty years out
of a life of sixty years, but we do not do this for these acts are so
natural to us that we do not proclaim to be the doer.</p><p><br></p><p>But man always boasts. He boasts if he has even one rupee in his
pocket. When he has thousands of rupees, he proclaims his riches for
sure. Yet he would pay thousands of rupees for one breath. But he never
boasts about it. If a dying man were told that he would be given so many
breaths if he agreed to give away his wealth, he would most willingly
part with it. But it is strange that all his life he proclaimed his
paltry wealth and never his precious breath! Breath was natural to him
and hence did not need to be proclaimed. Wealth was not his nature. He
had to toil in order to attain it, and hence the claim.</p><p>Where there is effort, there is ego. Where there is no effort there
is no ego. If God had to make an effort to make the world, as we do to
gain wealth, then ego would bound to be there. But if it is an
effortless act on His part – like our breathing – then there is no
question of the ego and, hence, of proclamation.</p><p><br></p><p>So those who know never like to say that God made the world. They
prefer to say, “God became the world.” They do not allow even this much
distinction: that God made the trees. They say God creates Himself and
becomes the trees. The clouds that glide in the skies are not driven by
the power of God. Rather it is God himself who glides in the clouds. God
does not create man; rather, He himself is born as man.</p><p><br></p><p>Understand this a little. An artist paints a picture. No sooner is it
made than it becomes separate from the artist. But God is not separate
from His creation, because there is no way for Him to stand apart. He is
connected with His creation like a dancer with his dance. When a dancer
dances, he and his dance are not two separate things; they are one. If
he stops, the dance stops. We cannot ask him to go away and leave his
dance behind. Therefore, we have depicted God as a dancer in our images
of Him: Nataraja. And the reason is only this: that the dance and the
dancer are one. God can be understood best as a dancer.</p><p><br></p><p>God and the universe are one. Whatever happens within the universe
happens within the order of His disposition. It is, therefore, that Lao
Tzu says, “IT (TAO) DOES EVERYTHING AND YET DOES NOT BOAST OF IT.”</p><p><br></p><p>Only one whose acts are stamped with force and violence bouts. Do you
know of any act of yours that you have performed without the feeling of
pride? Know then that that virtuous deed.</p><p><br></p><p>This may sound difficult because our good deeds also give rise to
conceit. The truth is that if there is no conceit, we do not care for
virtuous deeds. If I ask you to contribute towards the construction of a
temple, you will at once ask where I intend to place a plaque with your
name. If I say, “This temple shall bear no plaques,” know for certain
that this temple will never be constructed. We do not care for the
temple; we care only for the tablet that bears our name. The plaque is
significant; the temple secondary. The inscription looks nice only on a
temple – and therefore, the building. If no acclaim is forthcoming, we
are not prepared to donate.</p><p><br></p><p>The shastras say, “Give charity and you will be acclaimed in this
world for your virtuous deed and reap the reward of it in the next
world.” Spend one coin in charity and you gain thousands in heaven.” To
get a single coin out of a person, you have to promise him millions in
return.</p><p><br></p><p>But the meaning of a good deed is something very different. A
virtuous deed is a deed which does not give rise to arrogance. That act
which gives rise to arrogance and conceit is a sin. Therefore, it can be
safely said that God has never committed a sin because there is no sign
of conceit in any of His actions. To date, He has not once proclaimed
that ‘I am’. Therefore, all that He does is virtuous.</p><p><br></p><p>Your actions also can be virtuous, if there is none go consolidating
behind them. If an act is performed and nothing is added to your ego,
then the act becomes a virtuous deed. That which adds to your ego is a
sinful act.</p><p>So the question is not between a virtuous deed and a sinful deed. The
question is of the doer himself. The question should be: how is a deed
to be performed? The act must be done, but the sense of being the doer
should not be strengthened. Then, it is a virtue.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if the act is not performed and the ego is strengthened by it,
it becomes a sin. Action is not necessary. A man may not steal; he only
thinks about stealing. A man may not kill; he only thinks about murder.
Or, a man may not be fighting in the elections but only thinking about
it. Such people climb the steps of ego in their thoughts, which are a
substitute for action. It is not everyone who can perform. Action has
its own problems, its own difficulties, but everyone has the capacity to
dream. All men cannot be kings but they can rule over the kingdoms of
their dreams. But an act in your dream also helps to push the ego up a
few steps. Even if you are sitting in a chair and dreaming that you have
won the elections, this is enough to lift the ego sky-high. The ego is
like the mercury in a thermometer. The slightest pleasure you take in
your actions and it rises immediately – even when the act itself is not
performed.</p><p><br></p><p>But the opposite can also happen. You do a good deed and there is no
pride behind your action. Then, the mercury falls.</p><p><br></p><p>“IT (TAO) DOES ALL, AND YET DOES NOT BOAST OF IT. IT PRESIDES OVER
EVERYTHING</p><p>AND YET CONTROLS NOTHING.” This sutra is very subtle. Tao is the
all-in-all of everything, yet does not control anything.</p><p><br></p><p>A common question that has been asked throughout the ages is that if
God is, and if everything happens according to His will, then why does
he allow a thief to steal, or a murderer to kill, or a cheat to deceive?
And when the weak is tormented by the strong, why does He merely look
on? The question is consistent and deserves recognition. Intelligent
people have questioned this time and again. Actually, the biggest doubt
in the minds of intelligent people about the existence of God is caused
by this question.</p><p><br></p><p>Bertrand Russell asks, “If God exists, how can He allow a child to be
born blind or crippled or with cancer? If God is, how does this happen?
And you say He is the doer of everything!” The hell that we witness
today in life makes us doubt whether God really is. If there is a God,
doesn’t He deserve to be called Satan, seeing life is as it is? The
question is very consistent with the facts: if God is, why is there evil
in the world?</p><p><br></p><p>A Muslim friend came to visit me. This was his question too. He said,
“The biggest question I feel is that if God is, then why is the world so
evil?” He is right, because there can be no relationship between God and
evil. How can there be?</p><p><br></p><p>I told him, “Let us remove all evil from the world for a moment. Can
you visualize what the world will be like then?” The moment you remove
evil, the good also disappears from the scene. Good cannot exist on its
own. It is because of evil that good exists. Remove darkness and light
disappears together with it. Light exists because of darkness. Remove
the cold, and the heat is automatically lost. Heat and cold are
different variations of the same thing. If we try to remove death, life
too will be lost. If there is no death, how can life be? Or, if there is
no life, how can death be?</p><p><br></p><p>The universe exists with the help of polar opposites. The world’s
existence is brought about by the music between opposites. If the
opposite is removed, both are removed. Remove the male, and</p><p>the female is lost. Remove old age, and youth is lost. The young
person always wishes to prolong his youth because he does not know that
youth and old age are so closely combined that if one is removed, the
other is lost. We all wish ugliness to be removed from the world; but if
ugliness is lost, beauty will also disappear. If you wish for a world
without ugliness, be prepared to face a world where nothing is
beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>I told my friend, “If you wish for a world where evil is banned, good
will flee from such a place immediately. Then this world will be a big
prison house; because where there is no freedom to do evil, there can be
no freedom at all.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, the word “freedom” contains the freedom to do evil also. If
a man is told that he is free only to be good, what meaning does such a
freedom convey? This freedom has no meaning. Rather, it implies bondage.
It would be proper to say; you are condemned to be good – not free to be
good. When we tell a person he is free to be good, the freedom to be
evil enters along with the freedom to be good. God is the totality and
yet he does not control anything. This means that God creates, but He
creates freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>A man is free to be good and free to be bad – as bad as he wishes –
when God is the Lord of everything. This is because true freedom exists
only if there is freedom to do what one wishes, be it good or bad. When
no such freedom exists, man is not man but a machine which does whatever
it is made to do because it is insentient.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is sentient; he possesses consciousness. Consciousness is not
possible without freedom. Lao Tzu says; He is the creator, but not the
controller. He has not created a prison for us, where He stands guard at
the gate.</p><p><br></p><p>People like Bertrand Russell say that it is this very reason that
creates a doubt about His existence. But I say, it is for this very
reason that God is. Where freedom is not, God cannot be. Freedom is the
very proof of the existence of God. He is, because we are so completely
free. He is! You may compare the existence of God to the example of the
ocean and the fish that live in it. The fish are not aware of the ocean
but their very existence is because of the ocean. Suicide; our lives
become a veritable hell. Then we turn around and say, “Slavery was
better, because then we were happy.” Freedom always finds us moving
downward.</p><p><br></p><p>We seek slavery in all kinds of ways. And the ways we seek it are
really astounding! Erich Fromm has written a unique book, Escape from
Freedom. Fromm says that each man wishes to escape freedom. Wherever he
finds freedom, he quickly seeks out slavery and hides himself behind it.
This slavery cannot be detected easily because our habit . of serfdom is
so old that we cannot discriminate slavery from freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>If a person sets out to seek truth, he does not directly go out in
search of it but begins to turn the pages of the shastras. Little does
he know that this is slavery. He wishes to borrow even truth; – he wants
someone to give it to him.</p><p><br></p><p>If a person wants to know truth, he does not set out by himself to
discover it; he goes and falls at the feet of a guru saying, “You are my
everything. Give me the knowledge of truth. How can I, a sinner, do
anything?” He little knows that all his sins are his own doing. A lot of
toil and effort is required to</p><p>become a sinner. He admits his ability to commit sins by saying he is
a sinner. At the same time he says, “How can a sinner do anything to
gain knowledge of the truth?” Actually, he is begging to be saved from
his freedom. He is requesting this guru to become his jailer so that if
tomorrow, he finds himself in hell, he can put the responsibility on the
Guru. And if he attains heaven, he can always claim the credit for
having chosen this guru. Thus, man clings to the shastras, and to
gurus.</p><p><br></p><p>People like Hitler, Mao and Stalin are not born accidentally. They
are born only when a whole country desires to be enslaved. Each person
eagerly wishes for a man who can stand up and say, “I know what is
right, Follow me!” – so that they can follow him. They want to be told
clearly what to do and what not to do. This is why we pursue politicians
and sadhus and mahatmas. And these whom we ask, – they too have asked
others. They have no direct knowledge of their own; they too do not know
what is right and what is wrong. The fact is, when there are people to
inquire, teachers become available.</p><p><br></p><p>We are eager to place our burden on others. Freedom seems too heavy
for our shoulders. It should actually be the other way around: freedom
should give us wings to fly in the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>Freedom seems very cumbersome, because we do not know what to do with
it. There was a Zen fakir by the name of Nanin. One day he stayed late
at his guru’s ashram. He asked his guru to give him a lamp since it was
too dark and he had far to go. The guru gave him a lamp but as soon as
he began to go down the steps, the guru blew out the flame and
extinguished it. Nanin was surprised. “What kind of a joke is this?” he
asked.</p><p><br></p><p>The guru replied, “It never pays to find your path with another’s
light. Your own darkness is much better than someone else’s light. Go,
seek in your own darkness, so that the lamp within you may become
lightened. The more you seek, the more you shall be cleansed. You will
fall, you will dash against things, your limbs may break, but you will
discover your soul in the bargain. Therefore, I have extinguished the
lamp.”</p><p><br></p><p>Nanin has written in his memoirs that he was never able to forget
this man who had snatched the lamp from his hands and snuffed it out. He
was the one who pushed him into darkness and made provisions for the
lamp within to burn. “Today,” he says, “when I see the flame burning
within, my head bows down in reverence and gratefulness to this man who
caused it to be lit.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is freedom. It is very easy for God to place a light in your
hands, but you can only live like worms with the help of such light. You
will never fall, never go astray. There will be no hell; you will go
straight to heaven. But the heaven that is obtained with the help of
another is worse than hell, because such a heaven is a bondage. The good
fortune that is not entirely one’s own, that has not been sought and
attained and experienced by one’s own effort is worse than misfortune.
Therefore Lao Tzu says: “Tao creates everything but controls nothing. It
gives no instructions. It has given us the strength and the means to
walk but it does not say,”Walk like this.” The power to walk belongs to
Tao; the space, the path, the darkness, the light, the very person who
walks is Tao; and yet, Tao does not command: “go to the right, go to the
left.”</p><p><br></p><p>Tao gives us life, but it makes freedom the very basis of life. This
freedom can become the agony of life or the benevolence of life; the
choice is entirely ours. This freedom can cause that which lies hidden
within to be revealed. This freedom can also be utilised to create our
own darkness, our own</p><p>nether world where we can rot and decay and be destroyed. One thing
is certain however: that there is perfect freedom in the world. This
perfect freedom is the unacclaimed declaration of the existence of God.
This is His silent declaration of “I am”.</p><p><br></p><p>But we are totally unaware of this freedom. We are afraid, because
freedom means responsibility. It means that I am the only person
responsible for all my actions. If I find myself in hell, I have no one
to blame but myself.</p><p><br></p><p>This responsibility perplexes and confuses us, so we try to shove it
on to each other. The husband puts the responsibility on the wife, the
wife on the husband, and thus both absolve themselves, taking the other
to be accountable. They are not at all conscious of the game they
play.</p><p><br></p><p>Eric Berne has written a book The Games the People Play. In this book
he describes almost all the games that human beings play with each
other. This act of throwing responsibility on each other is also a game.
The funny part is that the one on whom we place the responsibility,
places the same responsibility on us. He who cannot be responsible for
himself how can he be expected to shoulder the responsibility of
others?</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, neither he nor you are aware of the fact that you have
placed your responsibility on each other. And so, we blame each other
throughout life, without knowing that we both are beggars who are
holding our begging bowls before each other. Each begs of the other, and
neither can give!</p><p><br></p><p>Freedom is frightening, so we try to look for some kind of slavery.
Our so-called God [not the Tao that Lao Tzu speaks of] is also a
bondage. We place the onus on Him. We say, “We are in your hands. Take
care of us!” Therefore, when a man is happy, he never thinks of God; but
when he is unhappy, he always thinks of God. He does not want to bear
the responsibility for his own unhappiness. He is only prepared to be
responsible for his good fortune. He likes to feel and believe it was
entirely because of him. But when bad days befall him, he looks up to
heaven and cries, “How can I suffer so when you are there? Of what use
is your being if I suffer so? Either banish my woes and give me proof of
you existence or I shall not believe in you.”</p><p><br></p><p>A man came to me and said, “I have complete faith in God. I prayed to
Him that if my son did not get a job within fifteen days I would never
have faith in Him. And, within fifteen days, my son got a job!”</p><p><br></p><p>I told him, “God has struck a bad bargain with you. Do not ever test
Him again in this way or else you will be disappointed.</p><p><br></p><p>He was adamant in his belief. He said, “I am now convinced that He
is!”</p><p><br></p><p>I said to him, “This very conviction will land you and your God in
trouble one day. Your son getting a job is a mere coincidence. Do not
pride yourself that God took pains to get your son a job. This way, you
prove yourself and your son to be more significant than God. Even his
job is more important than God; God has proven himself to be your
servant. Do not ask Him for such things again. Such coincidences are
never repeated.</p><p><br></p><p>After two months, the gentleman returned. He said, “What kind of
words have you uttered? Everything is confused now. Four times I tried
to attain God’s favour, and four times He has failed me. God has turned
His back on me!”</p><p>I told him, “God has not turned his back on you. Neither does He turn
His face towards you. He has no face and no back, nor is your prayer,
your insistence, your appeal, of any consequence. What is precious and
meaningful is your own self.”</p><p><br></p><p>Your value, your meaningfulness, depends upon the extent to which you
make creative use of your freedom. Your value depends upon the right use
you make of your freedom. The very meaning of Sadhana is this: The
creative use of your freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>Sadhana means the creative use of your freedom. The worldly man is
one who uses his freedom destructively. He is leading to his own
destruction. He makes his freedom the obstruction to his own elan vital
and is instrumental in creating his own gallows.</p><p><br></p><p>We do not remember God in happiness, but we remember Him in our
unhappiness because then we want to shove off the responsibility from
our shoulders. Russell has written, “I will only believe that God really
is when there is no sorrow on earth.” Russell is right as far as theism
goes. Our theism will fade if there is no sorrow on earth. Think a
while: Will anyone remember God if there is no sorrow on earth? Will the
temple bells ring? will candles burn in churches then? Will the call of
the muezzin fill the morning air? These prayers, these calls, this
worship, these oblations of fire – through all these, our sorrow cries.
And the absurdity of it all is that neither temples nor mosques can
eradicate our sorrows, because it is we who create them and we alone can
destroy them. Sorrow is the misuse we make of our freedom. But it is
this freedom that we want to save ourselves from.</p><p><br></p><p>Really, would the thought of God ever have entered our mind if there
was no sorrow on earth? How could it arise? God is like medicine for an
illness. If there is no illness, who but a madman would think of taking
medicine? God is like a medicine to us. We use Him to cure our ills.
When there is sorrow, we think the medicine of His name; when there is
happiness, we throw the bottle of this medicine in the dustbin.</p><p><br></p><p>We think of Him in sorrow only, because we want to place the
responsibility for our ills on His shoulders. But you cannot place any
responsibility on God’s shoulders because God does not bind you. You are
free, independent. No one is there in this world who is a greater
advocate of freedom than God.</p><p><br></p><p>The freedom He confers on His creation is so profound that we see so
much dissimilarity around us.</p><p><br></p><p>The socialist and the communist, who always criticize God always put
forth this argument: that if there is a God, then why all this
inequality? Their argument appears to be correct on the face of it
because they do not take the trouble to think. Remember, however, that
freedom and equality are opposite conditions. If you desire equality,
you cannot have freedom; if you desire freedom you cannot have equality.
All people can be made equal, but then all will have to be slaves.
Equality can only exist in prison. Even in a prison, if there is some
laxity, inequality creeps in. Utmost strictness is required to maintain
equality.</p><p><br></p><p>Complete equality is possible only in complete subservience.
Therefore, if communism succeeds, the whole world will be one big
prison. If communism does not succeed completely, it cannot be
communism.</p><p>Freedom means that each person has the freedom to be what he wishes
to be. Then, inequality is bound to be there. Then inequality is
inevitable. If equality is to be maintained, each man will have to be
forcibly made to conform to the accepted level of equality.</p><p><br></p><p>Another interesting development that follows such equality is that
the level of consciousness falls according to the degree of equality in
a society. The greater the equality, the lower will be the plane of
consciousness. Supposing there is a class of thirty pupils. The boy who
is the thirteenth in the class cannot be made to attain the first grade;
but in order to maintain equality, the first boy can be forcibly
constrained to go down to the level of the thirteenth. Actual equality
can only be maintained at the level because the lowest can never be
pulled up to the highest point, whereas the highest can be obstructed
and made to go down. Likewise, it is not easy to bring all the patients
in a hospital back to good health, but it is very easy to make healthy
people sick. To pull back is always easier; to rise up is always
difficult. Therefore, the greater the equality, the lower will be the
plane of intelligence; and the greater the freedom, the greater the
possibility of intelligence touching the peaks of consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, freedom means that he who wants to reach the peak will
reach, and he who does not want to reach will not reach. He is free to
remain where he was if he so wishes, and he is free to undertake the
long journey – again, if he so wishes. So to people like Marx who deny
the presence of God on the grounds of inequality, I say that this is one
of the many proofs of the existence of God: that there in so much
inequality and disparity in the world because of the complete freedom He
has granted us.</p><p><br></p><p>People invariably invoice equality and freedom in one breath. Not
only this, in France they went a step further and shouted the slogan:
“Justice, Freedom, Equality!” This is complete insanity, but we are not
aware of it because we are so enchanted by the trickery of words. We
never try to investigate deeply, but are simply carried away by the
magic of words. If there is equality, there cannot be freedom; and if
there is freedom, equality is impossible. And if you want justice, you
shall have to choose between the two.</p><p><br></p><p>Then also, if you opt for freedom, your justice will be entirely
different; and if you opt for equality, your justice will be entirely
different. If you choose equality, then an attempt to be different will
be termed a crime. If you choose freedom, this very attempt would be
deemed a just and rightful act. If you choose equality, it will be
lawful to keep each man limited; and if you choose freedom it will be
considered lawful to encourage a person to be different. It will be
unjust and unlawful to hinder or obstruct a person from becoming unusual
and different.</p><p><br></p><p>All this is very difficult to deal with. Freedom and equality are
very important problems.</p><p><br></p><p>So, Marx denied God. He had very little to do with God. Rather, he
had no use for Him. But one thing was clear to him: If God exists,
freedom cannot be destroyed. Then inequality is bound to remain. So if
inequality is to be destroyed, we shall have to destroy the very
philosophy of the existence of God. Thus it is not without reason that
Communism is atheistic. A person cannot be a communist and still believe
in God. He has to be an atheist, because the very meaning of God is
freedom – no control.</p><p><br></p><p>What Lao Tzu said dates back 2500 years before Marx. Independence and
freedom can only be in absence of control. Only where there is freedom
is there the possibility of development. But then,</p><p>the responsibility rests with us. If we wish to avoid it, we will
have to find some means of bondage and slavery. If we do not make God or
guru our master, we shall make the state our master. It makes no
difference. Let he who wills, throw the reins round our necks. We are
ready to follow. We are incapable of walking ourselves; we need someone
to prod us, to goad us on. Then we are assured and feel confident. We
feel there is no need for anxiety; we cannot go wrong. But remember,
this is the biggest mistake Whatever we do after surrendering our
freedom is an error, a sin, a crime.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says, “THIS IS THE MOST MYSTERIOUS QUALITY OF TAO.” That is
so. It is, and yet it is not the cause of anyone’s bondage. Think this
over: If God comes and stands before you here and now you shall no
longer be free. Why? Because His very presence will create inferiority
in you. You will be thrown into confusion; all your misdeeds will stare
you in the face.</p><p><br></p><p>The priests explain to people, “He has a thousand eyes. He sees you
from everywhere.” This is only a trick to deter people from stealing.
God has no eyes. By this I do not mean He is blind. He needs no eyes to
see us. But the priest must admonish, “His eyes are always on you,
wherever you are!” This is just to create the fear of God with you. If a
person really believes this, it will be impossible for him to commit a
sin! How can he dream of committing a sin when a thousand eyes, like
searchlights, are always focussed on him!</p><p><br></p><p>But he who is thus saved from sin is merely succumbing to fear. The
sin is committed twice over. The theft is committed and the fear-complex
haunts the person.</p><p><br></p><p>I have read about a Catholic nun who used to bathe with her clothes
on. When other nuns asked her why she did this, she said, “Don’t you
know that God is everywhere? He is even in the bathroom!” But this poor
woman was not told that one who can see through the bathroom can also
see through her clothes. If God is everywhere, we can not remove our
clothes anywhere, for wherever we do so, He is bound to be looking.</p><p><br></p><p>These are nothing but ways of arousing fear. Man does not become good
this way; he only becomes fearful. A fearful man is never a good man.
Only a fearless man can be a good man. Priests of all religions,
however, have made man conscious of His presence everywhere – although
God is totally non-present. This too is a part of His total freedom. If
He were present, we could not even exist, let alone be free. His
presence in itself would have snatched away our freedom, because then,
how could we commit violence? All this then becomes impossible. So His
very absence is an inevitable part of His freedom. He is as if he is
not. The class-room is full, but the teacher is missing. Then, each
child does what he feels like doing. Each one is free to do what he
likes. It is His profound and mysterious, distinctive quality that He is
and yet is absent. He is, but He is not present. He is everywhere, – not
an inch of space is without Him, not a pore of the body, not a simple
beat of the heart, not a particle of matter is without Him – and yet, He
is not present. His non-presence is so complete that people question His
existence.</p><p><br></p><p>This is His mysterious quality: that He is everywhere and yet is so
unobtrusive that we doubt His existence. We can turn round and ask,
“Does He exist? And if so, where?” We are not convinced unless we can
see Him, because if He was, we could surely see Him.</p><p><br></p><p>Even one who says he has seen Him is completely helpless when asked
to show Him. He is dismissed as mad, of unsound mind. There are
thousands who swear that there is no God because</p><p>He cannot be seen, so when some one comes along who claims he has
seen Him, he is singled out from the crowd, and stands like a lone
figure against the crowd who revile him. Buddha, Christ, Mahavira,
Mohammed, stood alone against the whole world. In fact, there have not
been more solitary figures than them in the history of this world. They
lived surrounded by crowds and yet they were alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Mahavira was always surrounded by a crowd, but he was alone within
himself because not a single person understood or believed what he said.
Lao Tzu also found himself surrounded by thousands of people, yet he was
alone. Those who heard him doubted his words because they could not see
what he saw. Yet these were lovable persons. Their personality was
magnetic.</p><p><br></p><p>We doubt the words of these people and yet we cannot help but follow
them. Their elan vital is filled with a mysterious magnet that draws us
towards them. Their eyes are hypnotic. Once they catch you, they do not
leave you. We do not have the courage to accept what they say, and time
and again we wish to run away from them. We try to criticize them, we
try to escape from them, and yet there is something in them that
invariably draws us towards them. But these are solitary people because
they talk of Him whom they find present but who is absolutely
non-present for us.</p><p><br></p><p>Ramakrishna told Vivekananda. “I have come to know that you have not
eaten for days. Why don’t you go inside the temple and tell Mother about
it, you foolish fellow? Go and ask Her for what you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>Vivekananda was an intellectual who took nothing for granted and when
Ramakrishna talked like this he wondered, “Where’s the mother? Who is
this mother?” But Ramakrishna spoke with such faith and conviction that
he did not dare to raise these questions that arose in his mind.</p><p><br></p><p>His father had died, leaving a debt to be cleared. He found it
impossible to clear it. There was not enough food for two in the house,
so everyday he pretended he was invited out so that his mother would
eat. He would return home in the evening and talk about how much he had
enjoyed the meal so that his mother would be assured that he had eaten.
Under such conditions, Ramakrishna’s words seemed to be the words of a
madman. Which mother was he talking about? He could not believe.</p><p><br></p><p>Ramakrishna had just become the priest of the temple when the
trustees filed a suit against him. On the eighth day, he was called
before the committee and charged with tasting the food before it was
offered in worship. To this, Ramakrishna replied, “When my mother used
to feed me, she always tasted the food first. How can I offer my Divine
Mother what has not been tasted and tested? How can I be sure it is fit
to be put before Her?”</p><p><br></p><p>The trustees were filled with despair. What mother was he talking
about? The temple was theirs, the idol was one they had erected. Surely
this man was mad! He was a worker employed by them for eighteen rupees a
month, they had spent lakhs on constructing this temple, and this man
had the temerity to say he would rather leave the job than offer
untasted food to his mother! He insisted on smelling the flowers first
before offering them to Her, because how could flowers be offered to the
mother that bore no fragrance? The members of the Board looked at each
other. What was this man saying? It was unbelievable. And yet when they
looked into his eyes, they felt that they would have to believe what he
said. Perhaps he could see what they could not!</p><p>This man is alone. And the cause for his solitude is this mysterious
qualification of God: that He is, but He is as if He is not. So only
those who discover the art of seeing Him in His absence – they alone can
see Him. Those who develop the art of seeing without the eyes, they
alone can see Him. Those who embrace Him without the use of hands, they
alone can embrace Him. But unfortunately, neither the theist nor the
atheist believes in this mysterious qualification of God. Understand
this a little. The atheist says, “Leave all this nonsense! What is not,
is not. Where is the need for all these deliberations? Go straight to
the point. If He is not, He is not; if He is, He is.” An atheist’s logic
is straight and simple. He believes in mathematics and straight forward
calculations. He says, “Why go into all this ‘as if He is not’ and such
stuff? Why not say directly: He is not. Why go into a long fruitless
debate? If He is, He should prove His presence. Let Him come before us
and we shall accept His existence.”</p><p><br></p><p>The theist’s trouble is the same. He also is not yet able to grasp
the ‘as if’. He too cannot understand that God is as if He is not. Then
he begins to invent the devices we all know. One invention of his is an
image, a symbol, to make it possible for us to understand this
mysterious qualification. He carves an image. Then he forgets God and
drops all talk of him. He concentrates on this image now; he bows at its
feet. The image is at least a concrete thing he can catch hold of. Then
he makes an image of Buddha, Rama or Krishna and prays to it:</p><p><br></p><p>“I am not concerned with the formless Brahma that may or may not be.
You are enough for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>But this is also an atheistic attitude. He cannot defeat the
atheism’s argument so he says, “There may be no Paramatman but Rama is,
Krishna is.” Then he weaves stories of miracles around and about Rama
and Krishna to answer the atheist’s questions: “When a thorn pricks
Rama, his foot bleeds. If you slay Mahavira, he dies. Then, they are
just ordinary human beings.” So the theist has to invent stories of
miracles in counter-argument. He has to say: “Slay Mahavira. The sword
will break but Mahavira will remain unaffected. Kill Jesus. You may
think he is dead, but he rises again the next day. He is resurrected; he
cannot die.” All this is an outcome of our ignorance, because we do not
understand the mysterious characteristic of God.</p><p><br></p><p>A friend came yesterday. He is an intelligent person and has great
regard for me. He told me, “Why do you not perform some miracle like Sai
Baba? Thousands will flock to you.” What use are these thousands of
people? What shall I do with them? They come not because of Sai Baba but
because of the miracles. If even one came for the sake of Sai Baba it
would be more fruitful.</p><p><br></p><p>One who comes for miracles is not a theist. A theist is one who says,
“Everything in this world is a miracle. There is nothing that is not a
miracle A seed turns into a tree; clouds move in the sky; the sun comes
out, there are stars; there are birds and animals; there is man –
everything is a miracle!” He who sees no miracle in all this is
impressed by the ash that comes out of the hands of a miracle-man. That
the sun comes out is no miracle to this blind man, but a little ash
drops from this man’s hand and he is impressed!</p><p><br></p><p>The intelligence that believes in this ash is not the intelligence
that can go God-ward. Lakhs of people are bound to gather, but this
crowd will be the crowd that gathers to watch a magic show. It has
nothing to do with religion.</p><p><br></p><p>The stories woven around Mahavira, Christ or Rama are downright false
but the devotee, out of sheer frustration invents them. Otherwise his
God does not look distinctive from the rest of mankind.</p><p>So he says, “When Mohammed walked, even on the sunniest day a cloud
moved along with him. The devotee has to say all this because his logic
is the same as the atheist’s; he has the same intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>One who sets out to look for miracles does not have the heart of a
devotee. Is there anything in this world that is not a miracle? Show me
a single thing that is not a miracle! This whole world is a miracle!</p><p><br></p><p>Is it not a miracle that you are? There is no reason why you should
be. The world would have no complaint if you were not. But you are – a
complete living entity. It never occurs to us that there is no reason
why we should exist. The world would have got on just as well without
us. Yet we are! We do not know who creates us; we do not know who
destroys us, who brings us into existence, who takes us out of it. We do
not know. Is this not a great miracle that is taking place every moment
of our existence? And here are we flocking to see a man who takes a
little ash out of his hands! Lack of intelligence makes such things
appear like miracles. If man is intelligent, the whole world appears to
be a miracle.</p><p><br></p><p>Otherwise, we have to invent devices to prove that Rama is God,
Krishna is God. I do not say they are not. What I mean to say is that
everything on this earth is God. Everything here is divine. There is
nothing on this earth which is not God. Therefore, there is no need to
prove that Rama is God, that Krishna is God. When every thing is God,
Rama is bound to be God also. On this earth, existence itself is God.
But we do not accept a simple, ordinary man to be God, so we devise ways
and means to accept him as God. We place these before us as an ideal and
forget all about the distinctive speciality of God. We have torn the
mystery of God apart from our consciousness. We have raised our own
gods, our Tirthankaras, our avataras, and we go around and around these,
because these are what our intellect can grasp, whereas Lao Tzu’s
mysterious quality of the Tao is beyond our understanding. Remember
however, that until such time as the mysterious quality of the Tao comes
within your understanding you have not entered the gates of religion.
The day you gather courage and attain the ability to understand this you
shall have your first glimpse of the temple of God, not before that. All
other things are home-made stuff. All the avataras and Tirthankaras are
your own creations. If you want to enter into God, you have to remember
this mysterious quality of the Tao always.</p><p><br></p><p>He is present as if He is not. He is absent, and yet He is present.
If this is constantly remembered, if it pervades every breath you take,
the revelations of religion will begin in your Life, and the screen of
religion will begin to rise, to reveal the glory that is existence.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

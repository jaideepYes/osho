One sky is outside us, but another and a far more significant one is inside us. Our body is just dividing two skies. The moment we forget our body, those two skies become one and that meeting of those two skies is samadhi; the meeting of the inner with the outer is enlightenment. Then there are no more two skies, then there is one sky. But right now, in the ordinary human consciousness, there is the division. That division is false, arbitrary; it is because we believe in it. The moment the belief is dropped, it disappears.\nAnd meditation is nothing but an effort to see these two skies as one. Because they are one – that is their trueness, their truth. Two-ness is illusory; oneness is true. But one has to begin from the inner. The outer is available but the inner is not known to us. We are it, but it is not known to us.\nIn the ancient scriptures they divide consciousness into three stages: first, the animal consciousness. The animal is but is not aware that he is, and certainly it is impossible for the animal to be aware of who he is. Man is a little better, a little higher. Man is aware that he is but is not aware of who he is. A buddha is the highest rung of consciousness – when a man becomes a god. He is, he is aware that he is and he is also aware of who he is.\nThe animal has only one dimension, humanity has two dimensions, a buddha has three dimensions. Those three dimensions have to be achieved; then only are we free, free from all bondage, limitation, free to be. And its utter splendour explodes. But these three dimensions have to be fulfil led.\nThere are many men who live on the first level. Although they are no more animals, their consciousness remains lingering there in the world of animals. They are not even aware that they are; they are only men for the name’s sake. The greater part of humanity consists of those who know that they are but are puzzled about who they are. A very small proportion of humanity achieves\nthe third. And there is no reason why everybody should not achieve it, because it is everybody’s potential. It is our sky to be claimed.That is the meaning of your name.\nChit means consciousness, prem means love consciousness and love. Love is possible even without consciousness, but then it drags you down; it takes you more and more into the mud and the mire. Then it is a ladder to hell. With consciousness, the same ladder is used in a totally different way; you start moving uphill. Then it is a ladder to heaven. It is the same ladder but the direction changes: you start looking upwards. Your energy is uplifted. When you are not conscious, you are just a body. When you are conscious, you are more than the body – obviously, because you are consciousness and that consciousness changes your direction.\nThere are only two categories of people: those who live unconsciously and those who live consciously; and everybody else is somewhere in between. The greatest art in life is to make love conscious. The other possibility is also there: one can become conscious without becoming loving. Then one moves upwards but becomes life-negative. Then his way of life becomes the way of denial, of renunciation. That is the way of the monk. Consciousness can take him higher and higher but he becomes drier and drier; no juices flow in him. That too is not good.\nThe best is to be loving and conscious. Then one lives in the world and yet is not of it. One is not life-negative; one affirms life, rejoices in life. One is creative, because creativity is possible only when life juices are flowing in you. The monk is bound to become uncreative, he is bound to become ugly, sad, dull, dead.\nMy approach is to give you all that is possible for a monk and also that which is possible for a worldly man. Life has to be an orchestra in which all notes are absorbed. Life should not become a single note. Howsoever beautiful, it remains poor. Richness arises out of polarity. A man is as great as his capacity to contain contradictions. If one can contain all the contradictions possible, one has the vastest possibility of being.\nAnd this is the beginning: become conscious and loving. It is the beginning of a paradoxical life.… My sannyasin has to be a paradox.\nThe name is just the beginning of involvement. If you cannot even lose your name, what else will you be able to lose?..\nThe changing of the name is not only the changing of the name. It is an effort to contact your deepest core. To give you a name means to become involved in you. It is a kind of psychological penetration. It is not just a label – it goes far deeper. And it is not only a question of having a nice-sounding name.…\nWhen a name is given by a master it has some significance too, not only sound but significance too. And it has a message; it can transform your whole life. It is just the beginning of a great journey. It is a seed – it contains much. If you cooperate and you help it, it will grow into a big tree. And only when it has grown into a big tree and bloomed will you know the total meaning of the name. It is not only to be used by others as a utility. It has to become your very life style. It has to represent you.\nPrem means love, madiro means intoxication. Become intoxicated with love. That is prayer. When one lives in love, one lives in prayer. When one lives in love, one need not search for god; god\ncomes of his own accord. He seeks and searches for the lover; the lover need not worry about it. Love is always responded to. Once your heart cries in love, flows in love, it creates a response from the whole. That’s a fundamental law... without any exceptions.\nOne need not go in search – wherever one is one has to become love. And lukewarm love won’t do; one has to be drunk with it. That is the meaning of madiro. And there is no other wine which goes deeper than love. Those who know how to love don’t need any other kind of intoxicant – it is a natural psychedelic.\n[A sannyasin said she made love with someone she had been friends with for some time: Afterwards I was just so uncomfortable... When I’m not with him I’m not feeling it, but when I’m with him it feels as if I’m frozen.]\nIt happens sometimes, because whatsoever you call love is not really love. It is just a hankering for a sex relationship. It is just sex energy moving within you, creating fantasies, charms, beautiful dreams, projections. And because of all those colourful clouds around you the person looks beautiful – whatsoever he says sounds so sweet, mm? Everything that he does – the way he moves – seems to be just perfect, all is grace. But it is nothing there; all is inside you. You are projecting, the other is just a screen, an empty screen.\nYou are getting ready for a sexual relationship. Once that relationship happens, suddenly all those psychedelic dreams will disappear and you will see the screen empty. And that makes one feel very shaken, as if one has done something wrong, because one destroyed all those beautiful dreams that were around one and now there is no way to put things back. All that poetry has gone; now the man is ordinary. And not only that, deep down you know that now you are also ordinary to him, because whatsoever has happened to you has happened to him too.\nLove lives in waiting – dies in meeting, becomes ordinary. And then one feels frozen and paralysed, guilty.… If you have great dreams then the greater will be the fall. If you don’t have great dreams then there will be no fall. It depends on how romantic the relationship was becoming. Whenever a relationship becomes very romantic, making love is dangerous. Making love to a stranger is not dangerous, because there is nothing between you. But making love to a friend with whom you have been feeling so many good things, is dangerous; it will destroy your friendship.\nIf enemies would make love, perfectly okay, no problem. But friends – they should be a little more aware of what they are going to do. Because it is bound to happen: you will be flat on the earth. You were flying in the sky, above the clouds; you were so high. But that was possible only because sex was not allowed, so the energy was boiling within... moving and moving and creating the crescendo; it was coming to a peak. But one has to go when the peak comes. If one doesn’t go, then one feels very uneasy too because the tension goes on mounting and there seems to be no way to relax.\nSo when the tension rises to a certain point one has to relax, otherwise it will kill one. And when you relax, you will feel that it was all a dream, that he was just a plain man as everybody else is. Try to understand it. Once you understand, there is no problem; then you know the whole mechanism of it.\nThe mechanism is unconsciousA man suddenly looks so beautiful. Remember it, that all people\nare just as everybody else. But suddenly, out of thousands, one person becomes very very important\nto you; that means you are investing your sexual energy in him. Sooner or later the point will come where you will have to go into a kind of relationship, and when you do, all will disappear. Be ready for it!\nOnce you understand this whole unconscious game, then there is no problem. There is no need to be so guilty or frozen or anything. That’s perfectly right; it is how things are. One understands the way things work and then one is not worried; nothing special has happened in it. Next time it will happen again with somebody else – remember it. From the very beginning be alert and see the whole process: becoming more and more interested, becoming more and more intrigued, the charisma, the fantasy and the man is no more ordinary; you have made a hero of him. But that hero will have to go because the hero does not exist anywhere. It is your sexual fantasy. It is a natural biological process. There is a reason in it; nature never does anything without a reason.\nThe reason is, that if there was no fantasy involved in sex, people would not reproduce at all. For what? Just think: two persons who have no sexual fantasy, no sexual imagination – why should they make love? Making love will look so ridiculous. Just imagine two persons without any fantasy, without any imagination, without any poetry, just making love – for what? It will look ridiculous, so absurd. They will look fools to themselves. What are they doing? And for what?\nNature has made an in-built process to hide the ridiculousness of love. It creates a great cloud, very colourful, around it. Under the impact of that great cloud you move in love. Then even that absurd process, ridiculous love-making, looks as if you are doing something great, heavenly. But once the process is complete you are bound to come back to earth, and when you wake up on the earth, naturally you start feeling a little shaken up – something went wrong or what? You look at the man and he looks so ordinary. You were thinking he is some Prince Charming or something and he is just Swami Muktananda! (laughter)\nOne feels frozen – I can understand. They say that even animals feel very sad after making love. What to say about man? Watch animals. Look at a bull after he makes love and see how sad he looks going away. Completely lost, stupid, shy, ashamed... wants to hide somewhere so nobody looks at him. And see when he comes to make love – with what gusto and zeal!... And when he goes, then? Just see those two – and it is the same bull! Animals also feel-a little sad, mm? because it had promised so much, and nothing is in the hands. You have been befooled by nature!\nYes, that’s exactly what it is: nature goes on befooling people so that nature can go on reproducing, otherwise who will bother? There are a thousand beautiful things to do. To play a guitar is far better, to sing a song or dance or to compose poetry or to paint or to just go trekking in the mountains. There are millions of beautiful things! Who will brother to reproduce children? For what? And then get tethered to them... and a kind of slavery. But in that moment of love-making one is not oneself. One is utterly unconscious; something unconscious takes possession of one.\nIt is always wise not to make love to a friend. It is possible that by making love to a man or a woman finally you may turn into friends, but it is very difficult to make love to a friend and to remain friends.\nSo nothing special – this is the rule, mm? Next time it happens just watch it and be meditative about it... and you will understand something great through it.\nPrem means love, and kailash is the highest peak of the Himalayan mountains in Tibet... and the holiest peak for Hindus and Buddhists both. So prem kailash means: the highest peak of love.\nBecome a high peak of love. Hate is a dark valley and love is a high peak, sunlit, that goes beyond the clouds. That’s the only way to reach god. Only love reaches his feet, everything else falls short. Knowledge, will, effort, riches, strength, power – everything else falls short. Love is the only potential means to reach god, and one has to become a high peak of love.\nAnd that’s my whole work here: to stir people’s hearts so the fast-asleep energy of love can be awakened... to provoke, to goad people, to shock, shake people, because everybody is carrying a great potential of love. Once it starts wakening up, your life becomes radiant with it.\n[A sannyasin has previously asked Osho about her relationship problem.\nWhatsoever has happened is perfectly good. You have to learn to live in all kinds of weather. Sometimes it is sunny and sometimes it is very cloudy; one has to enjoy both. Sometimes you have a lover and sometimes the lover is gone. So while you have a lover, enjoy, and when the lover is gone, enjoy your aloneness, because soon another lover will pop up and you will not be so free again.\nJust always look at what the positive potential in it is. When a lover is gone you are left alone; now don’t cry and weep. You had always needed this space and you may have been thinking many times when the lover was there about how to be a little alone, to have your own space. Now you have it. Now don’t cry and weep. Enjoy it! And soon somebody else will come and then it will be too late – you will not be able to enjoy your aloneness; then enjoy togetherness. And remember the rhythm.\nNothing can be constant in life. Only witnessing can be constant, nothing else, so remain a witness. In health, in illness, in success, in failure, remain a witness. One day you are young, another day you. will become old – remain a witness. That is the only thing that remains constant, the constant factor. Everything else goes on changing. Nothing can be done about it. You cannot force anything to remain static. When it changes, it changes.\nIf your lover has fallen in Love with somebody else, what can be done? What can he do? In the same way once he fell in love with you. Maybe that day he had deserted somebody else. That day you had not asked ‘Whom have you deserted? Who is crying and weeping for you?’ That day you were happy. Now he has fallen in love with somebody else.\nFalling in love with you was an unconscious thing – he is not a buddha and buddhas don’t fall in love. It was an unconscious thing: he had fallen in love, now he has fallen in love with somebody else. Neither that time was he the master nor today is he the master, so don’t feel angry at him. Nothing can be done. Take note of it, that he is no longer yours. Don’t cling and don’t go on thinking about the past days. Become free of it; become available to the future again.\nThis is how one slowly slowly learns many things. This is the way life teaches, makes you mature and ripe. Yes, through pain, through pleasure, through hot and through cold... it goes on centering you. Only one thing remains always constant – that is your witness. Remain there, abide there, and go on watching the whole panorama, the whole drama. Then you will not ever feel cheated\nby life. Life never cheats anybody. If people feel cheated, that is their interpretation and a wrong interpretation at that.\nRelax completely and let go of him. If you move sad and miserable you will create misery in him too, you will create guilt in him. He will start feeling that he is creating misery for you, he is guilty. If he feels he is guilty he will take revenge on the new woman with whom he is. Why complicate things? What is the point of it? Even if he comes to you because of your misery, it will not be of any use. You will not enjoy his coming because he will come through compassion, not because of love. And he will take revenge on you because you have destroyed his love.\nSo once the milk is spilt, it is spilt. Don’t start weeping and crying for it; it is utterly futile. And even if you succeed in pulling him back, he will no more be the same person and there will be no more joy again. The only possibility is: let him go – happily, joyously. As he had come, one day he has gone; he was a guest. All our relationships are just guest relationships.\nLet him feel free, happy. He will feel grateful to you: you gave him freedom, with no complaint. That may some day bring him back, but that will be a totally different thing – not out of compassion, not out of pity, not because you are miserable but just because he knows your love and your love was so great that you gave him freedom too. Only great love can give freedom; small love cannot give freedom.\nSo be happy, be joyous, and tell him ‘Don’t feel guilty.’ Support him, tell him to go:‘This is time. We lived together and those days were beautiful and we are grateful to each other.’\n[A sannyasin says: Osho, the only time that I feel open to you is when I’m singing. The rest of the time I’m missing.]\nEven that is enough – don’t be worried. If you are open to me even for a single moment in twenty-four hours that will do. And don’t be greedy!\nEven a single moment of openness is enough, because all that is needed is only a touch: that triggers a process in you. It is not a question of being open to me for twenty-four hours a day. And slowly slowly, as my energy has deeper contacts with you, you will become more and more open. There is no problem at all. The problem arises only with people who are not even open for a single moment. Then it is difficult: from where to approach them? They keep their windows and doors so shut – not only shut but bolted, locked – and they are always defending, on guard. The problem is only with those people. With you there is no problem.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3466","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_madmans_guide_to_enlightenment/part28/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_madmans_guide_to_enlightenment/>The Madman\'s Guide to Enlightenment</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">28</h1><div class=post-meta>17 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3466 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Madmans_Guide_to_Enlightenment/part28.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part27>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

ladder to hell. With consciousness, the same ladder is used in a totally
different way; you start moving uphill. Then it is a ladder to heaven.
It is the same ladder but the direction changes: you start looking
upwards. Your energy is uplifted. When you are not conscious, you are
just a body. When you are conscious, you are more than the body –
obviously, because you are consciousness and that consciousness changes
your direction.</p><p><br></p><p>There are only two categories of people: those who live unconsciously
and those who live consciously; and everybody else is somewhere in
between. The greatest art in life is to make love conscious. The other
possibility is also there: one can become conscious without becoming
loving. Then one moves upwards but becomes life-negative. Then his way
of life becomes the way of denial, of renunciation. That is the way of
the monk. Consciousness can take him higher and higher but he becomes
drier and drier; no juices flow in him. That too is not good.</p><p><br></p><p>The best is to be loving and conscious. Then one lives in the world
and yet is not of it. One is not life-negative; one affirms life,
rejoices in life. One is creative, because creativity is possible only
when life juices are flowing in you. The monk is bound to become
uncreative, he is bound to become ugly, sad, dull, dead.</p><p><br></p><p>My approach is to give you all that is possible for a monk and also
that which is possible for a worldly man. Life has to be an orchestra in
which all notes are absorbed. Life should not become a single note.
Howsoever beautiful, it remains poor. Richness arises out of polarity. A
man is as great as his capacity to contain contradictions. If one can
contain all the contradictions possible, one has the vastest possibility
of being.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the beginning: become conscious and loving. It is the
beginning of a paradoxical life.… My sannyasin has to be a paradox.</p><p><br></p><p>The name is just the beginning of involvement. If you cannot even
lose your name, what else will you be able to lose?..</p><p><br></p><p>The changing of the name is not only the changing of the name. It is
an effort to contact your deepest core. To give you a name means to
become involved in you. It is a kind of psychological penetration. It is
not just a label – it goes far deeper. And it is not only a question of
having a nice-sounding name.…</p><p><br></p><p>When a name is given by a master it has some significance too, not
only sound but significance too. And it has a message; it can transform
your whole life. It is just the beginning of a great journey. It is a
seed – it contains much. If you cooperate and you help it, it will grow
into a big tree. And only when it has grown into a big tree and bloomed
will you know the total meaning of the name. It is not only to be used
by others as a utility. It has to become your very life style. It has to
represent you.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem means love, madiro means intoxication. Become intoxicated with
love. That is prayer. When one lives in love, one lives in prayer. When
one lives in love, one need not search for god; god</p><p><br></p><p>comes of his own accord. He seeks and searches for the lover; the
lover need not worry about it. Love is always responded to. Once your
heart cries in love, flows in love, it creates a response from the
whole. That’s a fundamental law... without any exceptions.</p><p><br></p><p>One need not go in search – wherever one is one has to become love.
And lukewarm love won’t do; one has to be drunk with it. That is the
meaning of madiro. And there is no other wine which goes deeper than
love. Those who know how to love don’t need any other kind of intoxicant
– it is a natural psychedelic.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin said she made love with someone she had been friends
with for some time: Afterwards I was just so uncomfortable... When I’m
not with him I’m not feeling it, but when I’m with him it feels as if
I’m frozen.]</p><p><br></p><p>It happens sometimes, because whatsoever you call love is not really
love. It is just a hankering for a sex relationship. It is just sex
energy moving within you, creating fantasies, charms, beautiful dreams,
projections. And because of all those colourful clouds around you the
person looks beautiful – whatsoever he says sounds so sweet, mm?
Everything that he does – the way he moves – seems to be just perfect,
all is grace. But it is nothing there; all is inside you. You are
projecting, the other is just a screen, an empty screen.</p><p><br></p><p>You are getting ready for a sexual relationship. Once that
relationship happens, suddenly all those psychedelic dreams will
disappear and you will see the screen empty. And that makes one feel
very shaken, as if one has done something wrong, because one destroyed
all those beautiful dreams that were around one and now there is no way
to put things back. All that poetry has gone; now the man is ordinary.
And not only that, deep down you know that now you are also ordinary to
him, because whatsoever has happened to you has happened to him too.</p><p><br></p><p>Love lives in waiting – dies in meeting, becomes ordinary. And then
one feels frozen and paralysed, guilty.… If you have great dreams then
the greater will be the fall. If you don’t have great dreams then there
will be no fall. It depends on how romantic the relationship was
becoming. Whenever a relationship becomes very romantic, making love is
dangerous. Making love to a stranger is not dangerous, because there is
nothing between you. But making love to a friend with whom you have been
feeling so many good things, is dangerous; it will destroy your
friendship.</p><p><br></p><p>If enemies would make love, perfectly okay, no problem. But friends –
they should be a little more aware of what they are going to do. Because
it is bound to happen: you will be flat on the earth. You were flying in
the sky, above the clouds; you were so high. But that was possible only
because sex was not allowed, so the energy was boiling within... moving
and moving and creating the crescendo; it was coming to a peak. But one
has to go when the peak comes. If one doesn’t go, then one feels very
uneasy too because the tension goes on mounting and there seems to be no
way to relax.</p><p><br></p><p>So when the tension rises to a certain point one has to relax,
otherwise it will kill one. And when you relax, you will feel that it
was all a dream, that he was just a plain man as everybody else is. Try
to understand it. Once you understand, there is no problem; then you
know the whole mechanism of it.</p><p><br></p><p>The mechanism is unconscious<span class=s4></span>A man suddenly
looks so beautiful. Remember it, that all people</p><p>are just as everybody else. But suddenly, out of thousands, one
person becomes very very important</p><p><br></p><p>to you; that means you are investing your sexual energy in him.
Sooner or later the point will come where you will have to go into a
kind of relationship, and when you do, all will disappear. Be ready for
it!</p><p><br></p><p>Once you understand this whole unconscious game, then there is no
problem. There is no need to be so guilty or frozen or anything. That’s
perfectly right; it is how things are. One understands the way things
work and then one is not worried; nothing special has happened in it.
Next time it will happen again with somebody else – remember it. From
the very beginning be alert and see the whole process: becoming more and
more interested, becoming more and more intrigued, the charisma, the
fantasy and the man is no more ordinary; you have made a hero of him.
But that hero will have to go because the hero does not exist anywhere.
It is your sexual fantasy. It is a natural biological process. There is
a reason in it; nature never does anything without a reason.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason is, that if there was no fantasy involved in sex, people
would not reproduce at all. For what? Just think: two persons who have
no sexual fantasy, no sexual imagination – why should they make love?
Making love will look so ridiculous. Just imagine two persons without
any fantasy, without any imagination, without any poetry, just making
love – for what? It will look ridiculous, so absurd. They will look
fools to themselves. What are they doing? And for what?</p><p><br></p><p>Nature has made an in-built process to hide the ridiculousness of
love. It creates a great cloud, very colourful, around it. Under the
impact of that great cloud you move in love. Then even that absurd
process, ridiculous love-making, looks as if you are doing something
great, heavenly. But once the process is complete you are bound to come
back to earth, and when you wake up on the earth, naturally you start
feeling a little shaken up – something went wrong or what? You look at
the man and he looks so ordinary. You were thinking he is some Prince
Charming or something and he is just Swami Muktananda! (laughter)</p><p><br></p><p>One feels frozen – I can understand. They say that even animals feel
very sad after making love. What to say about man? Watch animals. Look
at a bull after he makes love and see how sad he looks going away.
Completely lost, stupid, shy, ashamed... wants to hide somewhere so
nobody looks at him. And see when he comes to make love – with what
gusto and zeal!... And when he goes, then? Just see those two – and it
is the same bull! Animals also feel-a little sad, mm? because it had
promised so much, and nothing is in the hands. You have been befooled by
nature!</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, that’s exactly what it is: nature goes on befooling people so
that nature can go on reproducing, otherwise who will bother? There are
a thousand beautiful things to do. To play a guitar is far better, to
sing a song or dance or to compose poetry or to paint or to just go
trekking in the mountains. There are millions of beautiful things! Who
will brother to reproduce children? For what? And then get tethered to
them... and a kind of slavery. But in that moment of love-making one is
not oneself. One is utterly unconscious; something unconscious takes
possession of one.</p><p><br></p><p>It is always wise not to make love to a friend. It is possible that
by making love to a man or a woman finally you may turn into friends,
but it is very difficult to make love to a friend and to remain
friends.</p><p><br></p><p>So nothing special – this is the rule, mm? Next time it happens just
watch it and be meditative about it... and you will understand something
great through it.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem means love, and kailash is the highest peak of the Himalayan
mountains in Tibet... and the holiest peak for Hindus and Buddhists
both. So prem kailash means: the highest peak of love.</p><p><br></p><p>Become a high peak of love. Hate is a dark valley and love is a high
peak, sunlit, that goes beyond the clouds. That’s the only way to reach
god. Only love reaches his feet, everything else falls short. Knowledge,
will, effort, riches, strength, power – everything else falls short.
Love is the only potential means to reach god, and one has to become a
high peak of love.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s my whole work here: to stir people’s hearts so the
fast-asleep energy of love can be awakened... to provoke, to goad
people, to shock, shake people, because everybody is carrying a great
potential of love. Once it starts wakening up, your life becomes radiant
with it.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin has previously asked Osho about her relationship
problem.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever has happened is perfectly good. You have to learn to live
in all kinds of weather. Sometimes it is sunny and sometimes it is very
cloudy; one has to enjoy both. Sometimes you have a lover and sometimes
the lover is gone. So while you have a lover, enjoy, and when the lover
is gone, enjoy your aloneness, because soon another lover will pop up
and you will not be so free again.</p><p><br></p><p>Just always look at what the positive potential in it is. When a
lover is gone you are left alone; now don’t cry and weep. You had always
needed this space and you may have been thinking many times when the
lover was there about how to be a little alone, to have your own space.
Now you have it. Now don’t cry and weep. Enjoy it! And soon somebody
else will come and then it will be too late – you will not be able to
enjoy your aloneness; then enjoy togetherness. And remember the
rhythm.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing can be constant in life. Only witnessing can be constant,
nothing else, so remain a witness. In health, in illness, in success, in
failure, remain a witness. One day you are young, another day you. will
become old – remain a witness. That is the only thing that remains
constant, the constant factor. Everything else goes on changing. Nothing
can be done about it. You cannot force anything to remain static. When
it changes, it changes.</p><p><br></p><p>If your lover has fallen in Love with somebody else, what can be
done? What can he do? In the same way once he fell in love with you.
Maybe that day he had deserted somebody else. That day you had not asked
‘Whom have you deserted? Who is crying and weeping for you?’ That day
you were happy. Now he has fallen in love with somebody else.</p><p><br></p><p>Falling in love with you was an unconscious thing – he is not a
buddha and buddhas don’t fall in love. It was an unconscious thing: he
had fallen in love, now he has fallen in love with somebody else.
Neither that time was he the master nor today is he the master, so don’t
feel angry at him. Nothing can be done. Take note of it, that he is no
longer yours. Don’t cling and don’t go on thinking about the past days.
Become free of it; become available to the future again.</p><p><br></p><p>This is how one slowly slowly learns many things. This is the way
life teaches, makes you mature and ripe. Yes, through pain, through
pleasure, through hot and through cold... it goes on centering you. Only
one thing remains always constant – that is your witness. Remain there,
abide there, and go on watching the whole panorama, the whole drama.
Then you will not ever feel cheated</p><p><br></p><p>by life. Life never cheats anybody. If people feel cheated, that is
their interpretation and a wrong interpretation at that.</p><p><br></p><p>Relax completely and let go of him. If you move sad and miserable you
will create misery in him too, you will create guilt in him. He will
start feeling that he is creating misery for you, he is guilty. If he
feels he is guilty he will take revenge on the new woman with whom he
is. Why complicate things? What is the point of it? Even if he comes to
you because of your misery, it will not be of any use. You will not
enjoy his coming because he will come through compassion, not because of
love. And he will take revenge on you because you have destroyed his
love.</p><p><br></p><p>So once the milk is spilt, it is spilt. Don’t start weeping and
crying for it; it is utterly futile. And even if you succeed in pulling
him back, he will no more be the same person and there will be no more
joy again. The only possibility is: let him go – happily, joyously. As
he had come, one day he has gone; he was a guest. All our relationships
are just guest relationships.</p><p><br></p><p>Let him feel free, happy. He will feel grateful to you: you gave him
freedom, with no complaint. That may some day bring him back, but that
will be a totally different thing – not out of compassion, not out of
pity, not because you are miserable but just because he knows your love
and your love was so great that you gave him freedom too. Only great
love can give freedom; small love cannot give freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>So be happy, be joyous, and tell him ‘Don’t feel guilty.’ Support
him, tell him to go:‘This is time. We lived together and those days were
beautiful and we are grateful to each other.’</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: Osho, the only time that I feel open to you is
when I’m singing. The rest of the time I’m missing.]</p><p><br></p><p>Even that is enough – don’t be worried. If you are open to me even
for a single moment in twenty-four hours that will do. And don’t be
greedy!</p><p><br></p><p>Even a single moment of openness is enough, because all that is
needed is only a touch: that triggers a process in you. It is not a
question of being open to me for twenty-four hours a day. And slowly
slowly, as my energy has deeper contacts with you, you will become more
and more open. There is no problem at all. The problem arises only with
people who are not even open for a single moment. Then it is difficult:
from where to approach them? They keep their windows and doors so shut –
not only shut but bolted, locked – and they are always defending, on
guard. The problem is only with those people. With you there is no
problem.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part27>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |
